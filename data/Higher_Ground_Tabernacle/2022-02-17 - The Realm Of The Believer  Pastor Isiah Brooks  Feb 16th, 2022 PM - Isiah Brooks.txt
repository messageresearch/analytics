done that's the most important thing amen you can't carry your degrees you can't carry your cars you can't even carry your loved ones when each of us come to the end of our journey we come in naked but we leave out with character that's right and that is the character of the lord jesus christ without that character the gates won't open [Music] you love the lord thank god for our musicians amen those of us who are labored to come here this tonight appreciate everybody if you would turn with me to the scripture reading of saint john 15. saint john 15th chapter the 16th verse oftentimes we find christians saying that they found the lord what a false statement because god has never been lost amen and oftentimes you hear preachers say choose jesus but you can't choose jesus except jesus have chosen you amen even his disciples he told them i have chosen you twelve and one of you are and is a devil so we understand that it is god who does the choosing amen even though we witness and try to tell people about jesus christ if they have not been chosen they will never have an ear to hear amen st john 15 16 says ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask of the father in my name he may give it you amen what a mighty scripture let us pray heavenly father we come before you lord we thank you for your grace oh we thank you for your mercy thank you for those things that we do wrong daily lord thank you for the blood of jesus christ that covers us and cleanses us from all our unrighteousness what a mighty god you are lord truly you are the only living god amen we thank you lord jesus for your amazing grace for allowing us to see you and to know you yes when the world is in such darkness until you as being their savior is preposterous to them but you are to us our only hope we thank you father god for being who you are yes in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen amen pro i never could pronounce that word you may be seated don't even know why i tried it but the world think that serving the god serving the lord jesus christ is ridiculous uh they think that weak men serve the lord and most of the time they look at christians as being people who really has run out of choices in life and so they choose jesus because they have nothing else left to choose from what a deception is something about being a christian that we cannot deny and that is even when we were young and didn't know god there was always something in us amen that wanted us to know we wanted to know who he was and who he is and and and that that substance or that thing that i'm talking about is what we call representation hallelujah thank you lord amen and if there is a deep call there is one to respond amen i like to entitle my message tonight the realm that the believers live in and a realm is a field or domain of activities or interests and sometimes when you we make jokes out of it you might even see a person daydreaming and and you the comment or somebody might say man don't pay him no attention he's in a another realm or you might find someone that's totally uh just mad and upset at the world and there's no way that you can communicate with them and you'll hear that saying again man don't mess with him or her they're in another realm that means they're they're in a i look at it as being in another dimension a place where you're not there but they're there and to them it's just as real as this world we talk about illusions and things of that nature but when a person is in an illusion he or she doesn't know that they are in an illusion it's a real world and the things they're seeing you can't tell them they're not seeing it it's like when someone take acid or some strange drug that gives them hallucinations well you can't tell them that what they're looking at is not real amen it's a realm that we know nothing about those of us who who don't do drugs amen we don't know what that is but it's just as rare it praises fear and everything else and you can't tell them they're not seeing what they're seeing but it's so amazing this is not the kind of ram that the christian walk in this is not something that is uh uh imagined it's not imaginative or imaginary it's it's real it's something that is so real that we can call those things that be not as though they were hallelujah amen it's so real that abraham looked for a city whose builder and maker was god amen hallelujah it's so real until noah who had never seen a boat built an ark because what he was looking at was real he lived in a different realm and people in his day no doubt called him crazy you know something's wrong with that man in such a scientific age that we're living in this man is building a boat and what is that they had never seen one they had never rained before right but here was uh noah on the top of a mountain and they were visiting noah's place building the ark as though he was a zoo people coming from everywhere to see and mark this man but to see noah knew he had heard from god amen and by faith the bible tells us that noah built the narc amen and faith is not something that you presume it is reality amen faith makes things so real it is to you it's it's like you know your sight no one can tell you when you're looking at something you're not seeing it or when you feel something or when you smell something just like those senses the natural senses that we have there is a sixth sense that we call faith and that sixth sense moves and opens the door to a different realm amen yes sir amen how many of us who you believe and how many of us really believe that that we can move mountains jesus said it yes sir if you have the faith of a mustard seed you can say and speak to a mountain be mountain be that move and that mountain must obey you but you see it's not something you can do it's it's it's the god that operates in you hallelujah this is where many people fail christians who are justified they're sanctified but they don't have the power of god on the inside now and what god is trying to get the true christian to to to the place that he's trying to bring them to in this day is a perfect faith amen and the only way you can have perfect faith is when the perfect god is living in you amen amen i love the scripture where it says you have not chosen me and i'm so glad amen he said but i have chosen you and that makes me very happy very glad right and i have ordained you and you know what one thing about god he does he cannot make a mistake once god does something it's eternal everlasting but this realm is not something that you just walk into it is something that you must press into it is something that's real i mean even scientists know that there there are other dimensions and we know dimensions are real for the very fact that we can't see radio waves but they're there right we can't see colors flowing through this room but they are yeah we have instruments like televisions and iphones and ipads and all kinds of technology now that can tap into those rams and bring them here we know that uh by god's grace that uh uh i cannot say it there's there's uh uh scientists know amen that that when it comes to time travel we basically do it every day but we stand in one place and travel to europe by looking at what europe is doing tomorrow and we see europe yesterday and and they see you and you understand me it's it's so real and they're trying to find a way how a way to translate us to to move us physically into those places because they know it exists i mean scientists know but they just don't know how to do it and i'm gonna tell you like this you take enoch he was the first one that i know of according to the bible that was translated that's right amen so we know that there are dimensions that you can move uh uh from one to the next amen and you you go to the amount of transfiguration you saw moses elijah and jesus amen and they were all in their glorified body proving that there are there's another dimension yes sir amen that we can go into and live yes amen when the witch of endor called up samuel amen hallelujah it's a real dimension outside of this and jesus called it another world he said i'm not from this world i'm from another world amen hallelujah and what we need to know is that other that that world exists amen when people talk about oh i saw an angel understand that angel came from another dimension it came from another realm hallelujah amen amen and what we fail to see is that when we really get down to prayer or to pray we travel we call it travail when you literally get down and you begin to move into a realm you feel it but you don't understand it and all of a sudden your words are uh uh is no longer uh spoken by you but is taken over by the holy spirit and the holy spirit began to pray and the whole time you're enjoying it amen and he searches your heart he pulls things out of your heart he speaks those things and sometimes you get so lost in that atmosphere or that ram till hours pass you don't even know it seems like 10 minutes that you you on your knees and and you get up off your knees and maybe you've been there for an hour or two hours and somehow you travel people don't believe that but the truth of the matter is that even when you're sleeping you travel your spirit leaves and it's search the scriptures the bible talks about your dreams being ordered by god sometimes we come to a place in our lives that we've been to in our dreams and we call them deja vu i've been here before this seems familiar only because god has ordered you there i love deja vus because whenever i have a deja vu i'm like yes sir i'm on the right track amen so but let's get back to the praying because if you look in the scriptures there were always people praying god's people pray amen whenever you really want something from god you got to get down to business and you got to pass beyond this this veil of flesh right because this veil of flesh keeps holding you amen but when you when you begin to pray and all of a sudden you get into the spirit realm amen you're in a different realm you're in a different dimension and and and time will be no more for you amen you and i remember the time that hannah wanted a child and hannah was a wonderful woman in the old testament and she was barren and i i i kevin has his name i can't pronounce her husband couldn't give give her a baby at the time but she began to pray and she prayed and she prayed and she we wept and she wept and she entered in such a dimension amen that when she went to visit he lied he thought she was drunk amen or when elijah saw her in the temple in in in in the in the place where god would be he thought he thought she was drunk and she says no my lord i'm not not like a woman of belial i'm not i'm not of that kind of a people but i need a child i want a child and i've been praying that god would give me a son and god touchy life and gave hannah samuel you see sometimes we want god to give us but we don't want to pay the price to get it we have to do something sometimes amen and those things are simple get down to pray amen faith and prayer works together amen listen when hannah hannah when she was at the temple and she was praying eli came in and thought she was drunk and he said i uh she said i am not drunk but i am praying that god would take away my reproach you see in that day not to have a baby was a reproach nowadays to have a baby is a reproach and he said the lord granted unto thee thy request amen now listen to this people and you know it's true god could have spoke that word and he could have placed that baby in hannah's arms but you know as a real woman i'm sure hannah wanted the experience of what it would feel like to be carrying a baby and god knew those things amen now god could have placed little salmon right in hannah's arms all of us know that he's a creator of all things just speak to it into existence he could have put it right in hand his arm people said no he couldn't yes he could jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily he turned water into wine amen at the request of his mother right he turned bread and it multiplied bread and you know fish and was cooked bread and cooked fish sometimes you know that was the best fish fish and bread ever y'all know it was right nevertheless amen he's the creator and he could have done it any kind of way he wanted to but instead of doing that it was the regular procedure of nine months before the little baby come along he could have done it instantly but he didn't do it instantly he just give her the promise and she inherited the promise isn't that right you say old brother books let me say it like this so you better understand me god could instantly make us perfect sure amen he can instantly take away all your thoughts he could instantly take away all everything that that smears your testimony he can instantly take it away but if he would you would have no testimony see you and i must understand that god loves what he's doing amen this whole creation was created for his own good pleasure amen hallelujah and when you fall he enjoyed picking you up picking you up when you get sick he enjoys healing you amen when you have impossible tasks he makes those things impo possible y'all he makes them possible he takes the impossible and makes them possible why he takes pleasure in those things amen thank you lord as our brother isaac was saying sometimes we get so involved if we just step back and look at the whole picture we'll see what god is doing that's right amen god only meets the worshipper through the blood and under the blood you know you know god doesn't meet a man on this church banner god could care less whether you baptist methodist presbyterian catholic message whatever you want to call yourself that's that's not why god meets you god meets you under the blood of jesus christ that's the only provided place of worship the church you go to can't save you i don't care if it's a mega church i don't care if your preacher got three degrees you know doctors of divinities and dddlds that he can't save you the only person who can save you is jesus christ and you need to know jesus christ amen right and the only way you can know him is to what except the blood of jesus christ amen and a lot of times people think the blood of jesus christ is like having nails that that nailed him to the cross and you know he only had two hands and i forgot how many nails they got now 17 they're supposed to be the original nails that nailed them to the cross come on somebody you see what i'm saying amen even if jesus there's nothing he can do for you now because he's already done it amen he's already shedding his blood for you amen the atonement has already been made amen hallelujah if you're healing he's already healed you amen 2 000 years ago and therefore the only way you can get healed is to accept your healing amen god's only meets the worshiper through the blood and under the blood now i'm talking faith here amen amen you understand me because a lot of times we think well i got it just like the prophet god said even the disciples didn't have perfect faith they didn't at first they did not have and jesus sent them out to heal to cast out devils amen he did it and guess what the devil defeated them they came back with details talked and they said lord why how come we couldn't cast this demon out and jesus said first of all you got a little faith secondly these these come out by what fasting and praying you got to be more sincere about what you're doing for me and a lot of times people want all of these uh miracles and things that happen but it comes by way of your sincerity and most of all they come by way of prayer and fasting amen you got to kill your old man move you out of the way so that you can hear from god israel had no no place to meet god god has got one place today he meets the worshiper she see neither the methodist baptist or pentecostal he meets them under the blood that's the only provided place god has not in an organization not in a union but the blood is where jesus christ meets his worshiper when i see the blood see that's god provided way when i see the blood i'll pass over you say well where's the blood the blood is the holy spirit amen hallelujah the blessing is not the chemistry you can go and pick up some blood the chemistry perhaps offer the ark of the covenant or something out there but that's not where the power it was the life that was in the blood amen amen this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in that was a father dwelling in that tabernacle called jesus amen amen and that life will never lose its power amen because that life is god that's right it's true it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself and adam failed us we know adam failed adam and eve failed us the purpose for adam and eve was to bring forth people that would be in the image and likeness of god amen they failed us by what by sinning right but it's still god purpose because his purpose can't come back void y'all understand me if his word fails now we might fail but his word can never fail so god has to had to make a way for this purpose to be fulfilled if the first adam fell that means the second adam who was jesus christ could not fail amen that's why he was without sin and understand people of god there's only one person who was without sin and that was jesus christ amen amen even james said if you say you have not sinned he said you make him a you know you're a liar right and sin is unbelief even as christians we sometimes fall into that slot of unbelief and that's where the word of god said grieve not the holy spirit whereby you were what sealed unto the day of your redemption amen see so it was god's purpose to bring forth the people like unto himself that would be a word bride because we know that's where she fell she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him now i'm saying things and we have heard these things over and over and over and over and over and i can continue saying over and over because that's everlasting over but until we believe it not in our heads in our hearts it must be there in the temple it must be the see one thing about the holy ghost he'll never doubt his word amen amen he'll never he'll never fail in reasonable way he cannot amen because the word we speak are the words that he wrote or had written amen so she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation amen amen somebody help me here so why do we allow satan can to condemn us if you declare you got the holy ghost but yet you allow satan to condemn you why you can't in the eyes of god you cannot be condemned because the blood of jesus christ has covered you the bible said once and for all he shattered his blood god don't every time you make us in let me go put some blood there no sure you have the spirit of the blood which is the holy spirit in you amen and so when god sees you he doesn't see you he doesn't see your failures amen he said when i see the blood i'll pass over you amen you understand me he sees the life of the blood not only just in you but over you amen and he passes you by but it's the devil that keeps us in this rut he keeps us in this rut making us always feel condemned and we're not worthy you're right we're not worthy but thank god for his grace that makes us worthy amen amen see this is the realm we must lived in the bible says there is now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen no condemnation so why do we allow satan to constantly condemn us and the whole time he's doing that you believing his lie it puts you in a place of fear amen am i going to make it amen am i going to make the rapture am i really saved you see it's because you're doubting what god has already said about you she has foreign known and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages of upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her you know what that means sin cannot be charged it can't be charged you say what you mean this is where the bible says we are accepted in the beloved amen no no no it's not our righteousness it's not our righteousness people it's because we are in him and therefore being in him we are accepted yeah he was the only one that was accepted he was the only one that could take the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne he was the only one that could loose the seals thereof he was the only one that bloody lamb that jesus christ hallelujah who's the same yesterday today and forever that's right romans 4 and he says blessed is the man i say that again romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin amen what man you man hallelujah blessed is the lord blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world even angels is that right paul says listen to courtney corinthians don't you know you're going to be judged you're going to be the judges and if you don't know how to handle the situations in the church how in the world are you going to be a judge amen everything is a training place this is your training station god is preparing us for another kingdom amen hallelujah and you've heard me say it so many times when you were in your mother's womb you had hands you had feet you had a mouth you had eyes and none of those things were created for the womb it was created in the womb that's right but at the time of that it was created you know in the womb but it was created for the world to come amen you understand me because while you were in the womb your mama fed you she saw for you she felt for you she did everything for you but when you was born again you were birthed into this dimension this realm and anybody knows everybody knows i would never want to go back there amen right amen we can't even listen we can't even describe amen what this world is compared to the mother's womb amen huh that's the way heaven is like amen once we have birthed out of this realm into the realm to come we'll never be able to compare that's what the word of god says amen amen you can't even compare the sufferings of this world to the things in which god has prepared for you you can't i believe this is the day of promise i believe this is the day of the rapture i believe because the rapture is not instantaneous the rapture is a process hallelujah matthew 25 shows us that there were ten virgins sleeping five were wise fire was foolish they heard a cry right and they all went out to meet him five had oil and extra oil five had all and they all that one five went all went out but they were in a journey and those that were wise the bible doesn't even tell you the revelation don't even tell you the day they went into the door but we do know that when the foolish virgins came the door was shut it is a process it has always been a process the problem says well what do you mean let me tell you enoch walked with god if it wasn't a process the bible would have said enoch stood there and was translated but walking is a process you're leaving point a and you're moving to point b from point b to point c whatever but you're moving that's why the bible said you know uh according to thessalonians there was a trumpet there was a voice there was a shout ah they're not all the same it was a process being given to us in the last days if it wasn't a process in the book of revelation it would not have said the bride has made herself ready amen let me ask you a question if god would say seven days from now the rapture gonna take place most of us would go insane you know why because we would not be able to do what's necessary to do in seven days amen amen how long has taken us to move from point a to point b we be fasting praying crying we'll be doing all kinds of things trying to live right you'll lose your mind if he literally told you a day yeah that's true that's true that's why it's by grace yes that's why it's by his mercy that's because he chose you and you didn't choose him amen it'll never be because of your abilities you understand me in every lick of character that you gain on this side you gain it by his grace show me somebody in the bible who who won a war against the enemy without the grace and help of god is not in there you say well oh david let me tell you something david was anointed that it was it wasn't david it was the anointing that was using david you say well oh joshua said son stand still it wasn't joshua it was the anointing the christ amen that had him speak those words oh you said but moses opened up the red sea no he didn't moses was there when god opened the red sea that's right amen no man could have done that amen every victory came by the grace of god listen at the end of the day that's why those 12 24 elders when they saw jesus when they saw the lamb they all threw their crowns down amen and fell on the floor amen because they realized that every victim they gained was by the lamb of god amen the blood of jesus the power of god that's the only way you're going to make heaven amen it'll never be because you was fake for the church and you came to church every sunday amen because i'm going to tell you something then not let me go there but the point is your righteousness to god is like filthy rags amen amen i don't help i can't help but to get excited why are we so afraid mark 4 40 says and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith now he's talking to his disciples you want to turn there if you like mark 4 40. why are you so fearful hear his disciples right have seen him do so many things and yet they were fearful you and i have seen god do so many things and the devil is a boo and we get so scared it's the truth why are we so fearful listen what it says 36 first and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were there were also with him other little ships and there rose a great storm of wind and that wave beat unto the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hindu part of the ship's feet on a pillow and they awaken him awake him and say unto him master careth thou not that we perish i love that i so love that because christians as christians we go there yes we do amen we go there too often when things seem to overflow us over flood and you say oh what are you saying listen the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood he'll lift up a standard but oftentimes we don't look we don't wait for the all right amen we look at the flood says carried out not that we perish i can't pay my rent i can't do this i can't do that where are you y'all we do it amen as human beings oh yeah yeah i just i think about god i said that's why i love him he's got so much patience he's got so much patience so much long suffering so much love and all we need to do is have faith in god and when you have faith in god you have something just like this and nobody out here in the audience cannot tell me i'm not holding a bottle of water it is declaring itself i feel it i see it and if i could smell it i would smell it but my point is i know all of my senses are declaring this apology and it is real amen that's what faith does amen when you desire something from the from the lord and you believe god nobody can tell you that you're not holding that bottle of faith in your arm in your hand whatever you ask for amen whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it it's yours that's the realm god wants us to walk amen every day i got to get this cataract moved from my eye but don't you think i've given up on faith don't you think i've given up on god amen i remember when the prophet of god's wife had that tumor it was just right at the time he's in the slicer the thing disappeared i'm still looking for my miracle amen hallelujah i'm still looking for my miracle i i've seen him do too many if god can heal me for cancer you think god can't heal this no they say i can give you another lens i want my lens give me what god gave me keep me i mean you know i you know that's just the way i see it i'm believing it people say you crazy maybe i am but i still believe god is god amen amen amen oh ye of little faith right cares that not we perish and he rose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind and sea and ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said to one to another see this is where they their revelation why they could had so much fear though he had done so many things they didn't see god and the man they saw man that's why they say what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him they didn't see god they saw a man but if they had seen god they never would have feared amen amen even when their own confession their own confession tells us what they saw in the boat amen what man of man is this but he commanded even the wind in the water and they obey him see the bible tells us the first john 4 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love and that's our problem perfect faith and perfect love are twins amen perfect faith you say what do you mean after your faith virtue amen knowledge temperance right patient godliness brotherly kindness amen in the holy spirit so when you add up you're literally growing up into perfect faith this is the process of the rapture that's right amen i believe it amen jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my word of god and you y'all understand what i'm saying when you receive the word you believe the world and because you believe the world you become the word amen and whatever that word is saying you stand there yes amen you stand amen you don't bow a friend of mine sent me a little capture of i don't know whether it was a movie i guess it was a movie but they were showing how the early christians were being persecuted one burned to the state and the other one you know the others ran to the lions for the lions to eat them and i it just brought me to tears because those were real christians you understand me and i'm gonna tell you this whether you look at it or not as being this way wasn't human effort no they were anointed amen that was the ox age that's right the age of sacrifice they could never have done it listen everybody that recanted were those who were not anointed for that age that's right and don't you know the squeeze and persecution that we're getting ready to face it's going to take an anointing of god for us to get through it amen that's the truth amen amen fear not little flock amen it is the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom amen and he ain't talking about heaven he taught him the kingdom himself god amen is that right the kingdom the holy spirit the fullness of the statue of christ it's his good pleasure to give you the kingdom hallelujah glory to god i hope you're enjoying this yeah i am i really believe you and you become the word and you become the word that's the you receive the word and if you abide in me and my word about in you hallelujah then ask what you will and it be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you've said then you shall have what you've said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and ye shall have it it'll be given to you time space nothing else ever change it you know it's done time space nothing else changes it amen amen you know it's done hallelujah the devil said you're not going to make a rapture i said hold up you're too late for that because i didn't make the rapture in this century i made the rapture before the foundation of the world i was ordained to make a rapture i was ordained to be adopted as a son of god amen you must speak it that way yes sir you can't let the devil take away the word from you speak it amen and go forward with it now watch he said if you abide in me and my word in you saint john here you right you can ask what you will and it'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer hey my god i can remember the time when i was in school this is not a way of bragging but i believed that i was going to get a certain scholarship amen and you know i kept speaking it and people said well how do you know i said i don't know how come i know but i know and i got it amen amen i got it i don't know how i got it but i got it it was revealed to me somehow i was going to get it and out of all those contestants out of all those people who were trying to get that particular scholarship i was the only one and i made history in the club in the city of columbia south carolina nah i'm not smart y'all know that and you should know that by now all you got to do is hang with me just a little far but i was telling my wife i said you know i'm not the man i used to be but you know we look at these things and we fail to see even listen you don't even have to be a christian to have faith that's right that's true amen faith is what we operate by on a daily basis amen faith is god and that's something god gives every person everything you do is by faith a baby will never be a baby would never walk if that baby wouldn't have faith that he could walk you'll never ride a bicycle until you have faith to believe that you can ride one drive a car whatever it may be everything you do decision when it comes to achievement your faith must come there you must have a vision of it right musician you got to have a vision singers you have to have a vision and that vision is faith it's something that drives you to do something that you see you can do that you're not there yet but you're getting there and that faith that vision brings you to that place that you saw when you was way back here trying to learn to do it hallelujah what makes people get masters in doctor's degrees because they have faith they can do it right see if you are true seed you will hear the word that spirit baptized will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you you receive the word for your day and age amen see how clear the truth evidence become when the word is revealed to you again listen let me tell you something when you receive the word for your day and listen oftentimes we say well i received it i believe it but look where i'm at let me tell you something god has his own purpose amen god has his own plan yes sir hallelujah and even identical twins are not the same amen y'all understand what i'm saying god listen you go to an apple tree and every apple on the tree is not the same size that's right all of them don't turn red at the same time amen it all depends on where you are in the tree amen so is it with god all christians don't mature at the same time amen we don't go through the same trials taking for instance a tree that's going through a storm right if that storm is coming from the east the tree the apples whatever is on the east is going to get a real shaking now the ones on the back side of the tree may not get such a bad amen y'all understand me but they're still on the same tree yes amen it's good that's good that's the way it is with christians we go through storms but every storm we go through affects us differently amen hallelujah i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ amen it is the power of god unto salvation amen how else i'm going to be saved without the gospel of christ how no there is no other way jesus was the royal seed and he lived in a human body and when the spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to jordan and was baptized in water upon obeying the word the holy spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved soon son hear ye him the voice did not say this has become my son no jesus was the son amen the holy spirit positioned himself at that as that son before them all then having been filled thus in the same pattern holes at pentecost and every after ever after he went in to demonstrate power receiving a full revelation of god and from god for that day amen and i'm gonna close here i've got more to go but i'll say it like this people it's a ram that we live in but fear is not something that we can allow ourselves to do amen it's in the book of job i believe if you fear it it's going to come upon you right here says in the book of job it says job feared and what he feared it actually happened what brought it here it is is fear whatever you fear it's coming it's not faith fear is just basically the perversion of faith but it's amazing how fear listen you remember that time i told you i was on american airline and i thought i was going to crash and such a fear uh uh gripped me i could hardly breathe fear is real it's real but it's not of god amen it brought it his fear and that's what happened it happened right his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if he knowed it wouldn't happen it wouldn't have happened see what i mean if you're afraid when you come by by the prayer line maybe i just haven't haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry see but if you know that it's going to happen it'll happen see it's a substance of something job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear that your disease is going to leave or won't leave it won't that's right if you have faith that it will well you know see you can ask medical doctors the first thing he'll try to get you to do is to have confidence in the medicine he's giving you that's good that's the truth and if you're giving if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone amen that's good you know what i'm saying it's the truth and what we fail to see it's like when peter says lord if that be you bid me come well he didn't fear at the beginning but when the storm began to you know dash and the the man the man is walking on water amen and jesus is right there y'all know what i'm saying when peter began to sink and you've heard me say this before god just said oh so oh he's sinking he's sinking he's sinking let me no he was right in hand reach i'm reach jesus just lift him up why would you fear at the moment he's you can see him so much clearer i don't care how many waves of the wind but he right there you could see him your victory is right there right there amen and you fear it think about it folks let me tell you something we must live in faith amen and faith is our realm to live in amen when you resist the devil that means you just turned him down you you don't even have a conversation with him amen but faith is where you must the judge shall live by his faith amen i love it the scripture used to say the scripture say the just shall live by faith but there's one that says that just shall live by his faith that's when god comes in you you live by his faith and his faith will never fail this is the realm and that's why god is making things come before us look like it's so impossible let me tell you something don't you allow yourself to be so distracted right now because the most important thing that that god wants to happen in you is to build himself in you amen grow up into christ and understand what the word says you are a pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and is washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you've never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of jesus christ right that's right every man and woman i'm closing with that let's stop fearing amen let's start praying amen faith and prayer works together we used to sing that song in that little pentecostal church prayer and faith we'll always work together tearing it up but you see it it does always will work together because one thing about prayer if you're lacking faith it will give you a boost talking about a boost that's the kind of shot we need amen my boots of faith thank god good let's stand god is so good to us [Music] if there'll be no one that desired prayer we'll ask ourselves to come and sing a couple of them dismissions by god's grace i trust the word of god was a blessing to you tonight amen understand god god chose you he'll never let you go amen in his bible in his word he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you i don't know what job was feeling but one thing for certain he kept his integrity and because of that in the midst of that great trial understand every great trial reproduces a revelation more of god somehow you see god in a different way that you've never seen him before after the storm is all over it's necessary for all of us and i'll say because yours is different from mine doesn't mean that you're less of a christian than i am and vice versa we all get to heaven by one way and that's the blood of jesus christ [Music] deeper [Music] is the lamb [Music] jesus will sing [Music] over here [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] cleansing blood [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen aren't you
