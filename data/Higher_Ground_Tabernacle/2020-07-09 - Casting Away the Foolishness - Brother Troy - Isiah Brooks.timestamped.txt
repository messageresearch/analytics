[32:58] message this morning or this evening
[33:03] well as we stand we'll open our Bibles
[33:06] to book of Nehemiah chapter 13 wanted to
[33:15] speak a message this evening called
[33:19] casting away the foolishness from
[33:24] Nehemiah chapter 13 verse verse 4
[33:28] through 9 just everybody's had a good
[33:31] week it's always nice to come in the
[33:38] midst of the week and you're dealing
[33:42] with everybody that's out there we
[33:45] gathered together one place one people
[33:49] one Accord believing the same thing
[33:53] expecting trusting in the name of the
[33:56] Lord Jesus Christ we know in whom we've
[33:58] believed it and we're not here in doubt
[34:01] we're not here wondering who we are
[34:03] we're not here hoping we know who we are
[34:06] we're here because we believe we believe
[34:09] in the Lord Jesus Christ he has called
[34:11] us to be his bride and because of that
[34:14] we came to this place came to this room
[34:17] not to hear from me not to hear from any
[34:21] one of us but to hear from the Most High
[34:24] God and I believe that that expectation
[34:27] they're coming into this place with that
[34:30] expectation putting our trust in that
[34:33] that he made for us there wherever two
[34:35] or three here gathering in my name I
[34:37] will be right there in the midst of them
[34:39] that by that divine appointment that by
[34:42] that divine promise that he gave to us
[34:45] that we put our trust in that promise
[34:48] that he will have respect unto his word
[34:51] and come down into this room what kind
[34:55] of people aren't we to be what kind of a
[34:57] hearts ought we to have the seeming to
[34:59] not come out of tradition to not come
[35:02] out of just being tired we're coming out
[35:06] of but to lay all those things down and
[35:07] Leila sings outside and I say Lord I
[35:10] ain't coming in the one faith that you
[35:12] gave unto me to cast my burdens down at
[35:15] your feet to trust in you as the Most
[35:17] High God and to cast away all my
[35:19] foolishness and to look forward towards
[35:21] the cross towards then dwelling of the
[35:23] holy spirit that he has given unto us
[35:25] amen that's the only way we can live in
[35:27] this day let's read law as I said
[35:31] Nehemiah chapter 13 we'll start with the
[35:35] fourth verse read on down to the ninth
[35:40] verse and you remember this is when the
[35:43] children of Israel that left the
[35:47] Babylonian captivity behind they've gone
[35:49] back to Jerusalem they have a
[35:52] commandment to rebuild the temple and
[35:58] this is a little of the things we're
[36:01] going on trying to rebuild that place
[36:04] where God could be properly worshiped
[36:06] and it's an interesting to see how this
[36:09] little glimpse of all the trials you
[36:13] know something like this when God is
[36:16] turning a corner does not come without
[36:18] trials and this is a time when God was
[36:21] turning a corner and with that corner
[36:24] came trials came tests and a test is
[36:28] always to see what you're gonna do with
[36:30] it and that's what God was happening to
[36:32] the children of Israel is here right now
[36:33] a God was testing them and trying them
[36:35] to see what they would do with that test
[36:38] was that trial verse 4 says Nehemiah
[36:42] here he's talking he says I'm before
[36:44] this alaya should the
[36:47] priest having the oversight of the
[36:49] chamber of the house of our God it's
[36:53] quite a position it's quite a
[36:55] responsibility
[36:57] he had the the position of having the
[37:01] oversight of the chamber of the house of
[37:03] our God but he was allied on to Tobiah
[37:10] and he had prepared him now it's not
[37:13] saying he prepared to God but he
[37:15] prepared unto Tobiah a great chamber
[37:19] where before they had laid the meat
[37:22] offerings and the frankincense and the
[37:24] vessels and the ties of the court and
[37:26] the new wine and the oil which were
[37:28] commanded to be given to the Levites to
[37:31] the singers to the porters and the
[37:33] offerings of the priests but all this
[37:35] time was I not in Jerusalem for in the
[37:38] two and the thirtieth year of our taxes
[37:40] a king of Babylon came I into the King
[37:43] and for certain days I obtained leave of
[37:46] the King so he went 500 miles back to
[37:48] Babylon to take care of these matters
[37:50] and he comes back to see what condition
[37:53] the temple is in after coming back so he
[37:56] travels 500 miles back to Jerusalem and
[37:59] he and this is what he comes back to to
[38:02] the sea the man has the oversight of the
[38:05] house of the God to see what condition
[38:07] the house of God is in and it says when
[38:10] I came to Jerusalem and I understood of
[38:13] the evil that Elijah did for Tobiah and
[38:17] preparing him a chamber in the courts of
[38:20] the house of God and he grieved me sore
[38:23] therefore I cast forth all the household
[38:26] stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber and
[38:28] then I commanded and they cleansed the
[38:31] Chamber's and thither I brought again
[38:34] the vessels of the house of God with the
[38:36] meat offerings and the frankincense and
[38:38] I perceived that the portion of the
[38:40] Levites had not been given to them for
[38:42] the Levites and the singers that did the
[38:44] work they had fled everyone unto his
[38:46] field and then I contended with rulers I
[38:50] said why is the house of God forsaken
[38:53] and I gathered them together and I set
[38:55] them in their place then brought all of
[38:58] Judah the tide of the corn and
[39:00] new wine in the oil and the treasure and
[39:03] the Treasuries Amy let's just let's just
[39:06] stop right there let's just bow our
[39:10] heads in winter prayer heavenly thought
[39:12] we just approach unto you this evening
[39:14] trust in a new lord the one that called
[39:17] us here the one that gave the promise
[39:19] that when we did come you'll be with us
[39:20] that that same God is able to make
[39:23] provisions for us tonight Lord that a
[39:25] message might go forth Lord not a
[39:27] message of my own lips Lord but a
[39:29] message from you to the people Lord I
[39:31] pray we come in that expectation Lord
[39:33] that you will meet the people here at
[39:35] their hearts door so therefore Lord let
[39:38] us prepare our hearts right now Lord for
[39:40] we didn't come in and just any old way
[39:42] but we came in the name of the Lord
[39:45] Jesus Christ we came in the one that
[39:47] shows us that called us that has
[39:50] delivered us from sin and shame and and
[39:52] as cleansed us and prepared us for your
[39:55] ownself Lord that's to you that we came
[39:57] Lord then Lord let us be worthy of this
[39:59] great high and holy calling and prepare
[40:02] our hearts to receive Christ in the name
[40:04] of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen he
[40:08] could be seated you know I can only
[40:13] imagine that when Nehemiah is going
[40:17] through he knew his calling was to leave
[40:22] the things of Babylon behind to go back
[40:26] to Jerusalem and to rebuild the house of
[40:29] God but in order to rebuild the house of
[40:32] God they had to go back to the ways of
[40:35] Moses to go back to the law of Moses
[40:38] beforehand and to set everything back in
[40:41] order the way that it ought to be so
[40:43] they had to take the first you have to
[40:46] evaluate the condition of the place and
[40:48] he came when we came to Jerusalem he
[40:50] found that the temple was in ruins that
[40:53] there the place had been burned down
[40:54] there was unclean animals were milling
[40:58] in and out and going in and out of the
[41:00] holy place and and so the first thing
[41:02] you had to do was begin to set a
[41:03] boundary a place where knowing clean
[41:07] thing will cross this threshold that we
[41:11] I set a boundary here that this place
[41:13] will be
[41:14] reserved and sanctified for the for the
[41:17] Most High God and what's he big set that
[41:21] boundary he lived back to the the law of
[41:23] Moses to see what ought to be inside
[41:25] that place and he began to see it they
[41:28] there's little rooms in the place and
[41:30] this room was reserved for this and this
[41:33] room over here was reserved for that and
[41:34] so the the ties and the meal offerings
[41:37] and the offerings unto God and all these
[41:39] places had little rooms and and he began
[41:41] to fill up those rooms with the the
[41:44] items that ought to be in those places
[41:46] so that God could be properly worshiped
[41:49] so that God could have a place of rest
[41:52] upon the earth so that God that went so
[41:55] if God ever came to come to visit by
[41:57] that place that God would be drawn to
[42:00] that place then be the house of God's
[42:02] rest that that be a place where you know
[42:06] I think we all know the condition that
[42:07] we all know that revivals come we all
[42:12] know that there are times of revival we
[42:14] all know that there are times when the
[42:16] Spirit of God comes through the city and
[42:18] comes through the place but he always
[42:21] comes to the houses that are prepared he
[42:23] always comes to the houses that been
[42:25] made clean he always comes to the people
[42:27] that are been praying to the keep people
[42:29] have been waiting the people who have
[42:31] been crying out for the sins that are
[42:33] done in the city and the Holy Spirit is
[42:35] always drawn to those places and so
[42:37] there in Jerusalem they began to make
[42:39] Jerusalem back into that kind of a place
[42:41] back into that kind of place where the
[42:43] Spirit of God would be welcomed where
[42:45] the Spirit of God could have room to
[42:48] move and live and have his beat and
[42:50] they'd begin to make the the Temple in
[42:53] Jerusalem that type of a holy place but
[42:56] then they remember that they were there
[42:59] that that Babylon still had oversight
[43:02] over the region and Nehemiah had to go
[43:04] back to Babylon to see about some
[43:06] matters in some business and so he he
[43:09] assigned a man to have oversight over
[43:12] the house of the Most High God and and
[43:15] Nehemiah was gone in those two years he
[43:17] came back to see how the revival was
[43:20] going on how the house of God was being
[43:23] built how the place was being persevere
[43:26] to maintain
[43:27] and that the house see if the spirit God
[43:30] have been visiting on a regular basis to
[43:32] see if God was still being worshipped
[43:34] and he found out that the man that had
[43:36] the oversight over the house of God had
[43:39] had allied himself with the enemy had to
[43:43] make a an alliance with the enemy and
[43:46] had taken one of the the rooms of the
[43:49] house of God one of the rooms in the
[43:51] temple of God and had given that to the
[43:54] enemy just that little room this is the
[43:56] enemy's place a little house where the
[43:59] enemy can come in and live and rest and
[44:01] have peace you know let me tell you one
[44:02] thing is God is a jealous God and God
[44:05] does not like to share his house but be
[44:09] assured that if God ever calls a house
[44:11] back to himself again if a house ever
[44:14] gets cleansed and sanctified and
[44:17] reserved unto God that house belongs to
[44:20] God and to God alone and he's not there
[44:23] to share he's not there to just give a
[44:29] little bit of real estate to himself and
[44:30] a little bit of real estate over to the
[44:32] enemy no that place is theirs to be
[44:34] dedicated unto the Lord so when you read
[44:36] that those verses their communities all
[44:38] almost imagine Nehemiah is heartbreaking
[44:41] you know he that that verse Sara says
[44:45] that Elijah cheb the priests having the
[44:49] oversight of the chamber of the house of
[44:52] God was a lie done to Tobiah
[44:54] and prepared him a great cheat prepared
[44:59] him a great chamber the thing of it is
[45:04] as Nehemiah knew the vision he knew the
[45:08] corner that God was turning he knew what
[45:11] God the expectation that God had the
[45:13] vision that God laid out and just
[45:16] assured if God ever lays out a vision
[45:18] God has an intent that that vation will
[45:21] come to pass and then there are going to
[45:24] be a people upon this earth they will
[45:26] recognize that vision and when they
[45:28] recognize that vision they have respects
[45:30] under the word of God and the Spirit of
[45:33] the God begins to move upon their life
[45:34] and they dedicate their lives unto that
[45:37] vision and let me assure that God will
[45:39] not
[45:40] until that vision is manifested in their
[45:42] lives but when the man that has the
[45:45] vision in his mind begins to look at the
[45:47] house of God and all sudden begin to see
[45:49] the men over here men over there are
[45:53] beginning to reserve their hearts
[45:55] chambers and give them back over to the
[45:58] enemy
[45:58] it breaks as blood iran says it breaks
[46:01] you see what makes a minister's heart
[46:03] break
[46:04] amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 10
[46:15] read a few verses there from Hebrews 10
[46:19] verse 11 Paul here he's speaking he says
[46:24] talking about the duties of the of the
[46:28] priests and of the house of God he says
[46:34] and every priest
[46:43] you
[47:32] Paul must have seen something I don't
[47:36] think Paul could have written this
[47:37] without permission I think Paul had to
[47:40] that here's our you know Paul is a
[47:42] prophet and I think he had to have seen
[47:45] something he had just seen about how the
[47:48] priests year after year would offer
[47:50] these sacrifices I think come right back
[47:52] around the next year and go through the
[47:54] whole process all over again
[47:56] why they have to go through it again if
[47:58] the year before if it didn't it's like
[48:00] the year before it didn't work what but
[48:03] they're just going through over and over
[48:04] again offering the same sacrifices
[48:06] offering the same sacrifices but never
[48:08] quite paying for the sins the sins were
[48:11] never paid for the debt still remained a
[48:14] man there's still an imbalance upon the
[48:16] earth a man where he have man's God's
[48:20] expectation and God's law over here and
[48:22] then our sins over here and the scales
[48:25] were tipped way against our favor and
[48:27] the sacrifice is over and over again
[48:30] we're just drawing the sheet over the
[48:32] scales of God's justice but if that
[48:34] sheeters ever pulled off you just see
[48:36] that the imbalance still remained a man
[48:39] but but now you come down to verse 12
[48:41] but this man Paul had you seen that but
[48:45] this man after he had offered once
[48:56] you
[49:02] in the midst of your day's work you
[49:04] don't sit down wait cuz you have still
[49:07] have work to do but but this man sat
[49:09] down why because his work was finished
[49:11] she sat on the cross it is finished and
[49:14] in verse 30 says from hits forth he was
[49:16] expecting until his enemies be made his
[49:20] footstool
[49:28] you
[49:32] but instead he gave and prepared a
[49:35] chamber for the enemy in the house of
[49:37] God but not this man Lord Jesus Christ
[49:40] because Lord Jesus he has an expectation
[49:42] that this house of God will once forever
[49:46] be preserved for him and for him alone
[49:49] and he knows that all of his enemies
[49:51] will be under his feet now God has a
[49:55] house and he as this house will be
[49:59] preserved however you remember as I
[50:01] preached a long time ago in Ezekiel
[50:03] chapter 43 if you remember the story I'm
[50:06] not going to go through it but in
[50:07] Ezekiel chapter 40 the prophet Ezekiel
[50:11] was leaving Babylon and he is walking
[50:15] down by the river Chebar and all of
[50:18] sudden he begins to see the presence of
[50:20] God coming down along both sides of the
[50:22] river and it's just big flaming whirling
[50:25] fire and he says you know that's the
[50:27] same thing you know I saw years and
[50:29] years ago now I know that's the presence
[50:31] of God in this place coming down to
[50:33] visit me and is that worldly got closer
[50:35] and closer all of a sudden he took him
[50:37] far away back 500 miles over to
[50:40] Jerusalem in the spirit and began to
[50:43] show he began to show
[50:45] Ezekiel the the condition of the of the
[50:49] temple of the Lord the house and roots
[50:52] vahana was destroyed how how the true
[50:55] Israel sins had destroyed the city but
[50:58] then he took them off he says but let me
[51:00] tell you I want to show you another
[51:01] tabernacle I want to show you another
[51:05] temple that will never be broken down I
[51:07] want to show you a tipple that will
[51:09] never be destroyed and he spends three
[51:11] chapters Ezekiel 41 42 43 three chapters
[51:15] describing a perfect temple it'll be
[51:19] it'll be so many cubics here it'll be so
[51:21] I'll be this wide it'll be this tall
[51:23] will be this deep it'll have this many
[51:25] pillars the pillars will have
[51:27] pomegranates here and and carvings there
[51:29] and and there'll be an archway over here
[51:32] and and he had every single single thing
[51:35] already deal to detailed out because God
[51:37] had a vision of what his house was going
[51:41] to look like and he spends three
[51:42] chapters describing the vision
[51:46] to the prophet Ezekiel and then when
[51:48] he's all done he tells prophet Ezekiel
[51:51] take the description of this house to
[51:55] the elders of the house of Israel and
[51:57] let them know that the house of Israel
[52:00] that the temple is in ruins because of
[52:02] their sins and I want you to make them
[52:04] jealous and show them the vision of what
[52:07] the house is supposed to look like and
[52:09] what the condition mean he says that we
[52:11] can let them know that one of these days
[52:13] there will be a house there will never
[52:15] be defiled again there will never be
[52:18] have any defilement the enemy won't come
[52:21] in though the unclean things won't come
[52:23] in anymore it'll never be a place but a
[52:25] place where I can come and live
[52:26] permanently and that will be the
[52:29] condition of us and make them jealous
[52:31] for what they have done to them of the
[52:33] house of my god I have to imagine it if
[52:42] the men had any spirituality left in
[52:44] them at all they would have to feel
[52:46] about this tall so realizing what their
[52:50] sins had done to the house of God but
[52:53] God still had in his mind a vision of
[52:56] perfect house of God that has no
[52:58] foolishness and you know and God still
[53:01] has the same thing today you know God
[53:03] has in his mind the image of an
[53:05] overcoming bride God has in his mind the
[53:08] image of a bride that will overcome by
[53:11] the blood of the Lamb and the word of
[53:12] their testimony
[53:13] then they've got God has a vision of a
[53:16] Bride of Christ that marches underneath
[53:19] the power of the Holy Ghost a bride that
[53:22] just one little nod from the Lord will
[53:25] go off over here and beam out her
[53:26] father's business and go off over here
[53:28] and be bound her father's business over
[53:30] there and over here a place that where
[53:32] when God wants to move in the city that
[53:35] he can whoa shall I choose this my son
[53:39] over here my daughter over here and he
[53:41] has so many choices because to work
[53:43] through because his bride has made
[53:45] herself available for the moving of the
[53:48] Holy Spirit and then because we know
[53:50] that one of these days the Holy Spirit's
[53:52] going to move we know that it's going to
[53:54] come when the bride has made herself
[53:56] ready Lord Here I am today
[53:59] I am requesting Lord cleanse me of my
[54:03] sins wash me of all the foolishness I've
[54:06] done wrong Lord cleanse me make me ready
[54:09] for the day father so Lord that if you
[54:11] want to move Lord if you want to witness

[54:19] healing to someone Lord they I'm here
[54:22] Lord I am available father no I'm not

[54:27] Laura I'm saying Here I am Lord
[54:29] Sid me Lord send me to the plate to the
[54:32] people to have the need and God has his
[54:34] people that have made themselves ready

[56:30] amen amen
[56:34] God set down Jesus Christ offered once
[56:38] and he sat down expecting expecting you
[56:43] know we got to have that same
[56:44] expectation where we have that knowledge
[56:47] we just know you know you know it's
[56:51] interesting you know sometimes you know
[56:52] I don't we like tonight you know I just
[56:54] didn't really feel ready to be up here

[57:00] schedule and I open up the email around
[57:02] three o'clock and I was like oh brother
[57:04] Troy's preaching well that's me and I'd
[57:08] missed the memo and I don't know how I

[57:30] know why should I be up amongst all the
[57:31] people

[57:34] brother so so Who am I but then all of
[57:37] us have that same condition who are we
[57:39] to be the witness under the city who are
[57:41] we but we are the one that God chose
[57:43] every single of us from the least of the
[57:46] greatest we are the ones that God chose
[57:48] to get on our knees and pray for the
[57:50] city we are the one that God chose to be
[57:53] filled with the Holy Ghost and who are
[57:55] we we can't say woe is me woe is me but
[57:58] we need to get up and say Lord here am I
[58:00] send me
[58:04] amen and have trust he set down as
[58:09] expected and an expectation then we
[58:12] gotta get to that place where we can
[58:14] also sit down but you know there's only
[58:16] one way to do that and that's by trust
[58:22] you know the Holy Ghost
[58:24] brother branham he had a quote there
[58:28] from how can I overcome he preached in
[58:33] 1963 he was talking about Noah's Ark I
[58:41] just want to read this quote there he's
[58:43] talking about Noah's Ark he says now
[58:45] think hard now if you're laying around
[58:48] getting Dodi getting soft
[58:50] get in get into the ark hurry quick
[58:54] because the door might close at any time
[58:57] he says there has always been an ark in
[59:01] God's economy at all times God has
[59:04] always had an ark in his economy a place
[59:07] for God's people to get on the inside
[59:10] and there's always and when the time
[59:12] comes the door closes and those that are
[59:15] on the inside or inside those are on the
[59:17] outside or outside amen
[59:20] and there's an ark in the days of Noah
[59:22] for the saving of his people and there
[59:25] was an ark in the days of the law there
[59:27] was an ark of the testimony and in the
[59:30] days of the law they followed the ark
[59:31] and there was a third dispensation right
[59:34] now like Noah's time like lots time and
[59:38] now this time there is an ark right now
[59:41] and that Ark is not in a denomination
[59:44] Amen not is it good works that you do
[59:48] but it's by one spirit that is the ark
[59:52] Romans 8:1 we are all baptized into one
[59:55] body in the domain of that kingdom one
[59:58] spiritual baptism no matter how good or
[1:00:01] how bad whatever you're in that kingdom
[1:00:04] by the Holy Ghost baptism see that's the
[1:00:07] only way you overcome you know every
[1:00:12] single one of us we just read that
[1:00:14] sermon title how can I overcome your own
[1:00:17] many of us he's sorry it always makes
[1:00:19] you look down in your life am i
[1:00:22] overcoming just now and in the
[1:00:25] temptation is always to think about your
[1:00:27] own mental condition you know many
[1:00:30] people there's many a good legalist can
[1:00:33] say I have overcome ayuh strived my
[1:00:37] whole life
[1:00:37] and I have lived pure and clean and I
[1:00:40] have overcome but that's not gonna do
[1:00:42] you any good
[1:00:43] many a good legalists will call
[1:00:45] themselves a good overcomer but it's not

[1:00:54] that

[1:00:57] message he says the same thing he's

[1:01:18] can I overcome and brother branham he's
[1:01:20] getting ready to get out the secret
[1:01:22] right here and he says see that's the
[1:01:24] only way you overcome and it's all that
[1:01:27] is under the shed blood is overcomers

[1:02:40] will he do then he will prepare the
[1:02:42] chamber but let me tell you if you are
[1:02:45] just reserving these little rooms for
[1:02:47] the enemy the Holy Spirit can't see love
[1:02:50] that
[1:02:53] doesn't matter the revival can come and
[1:02:55] they say oh the places already go and
[1:02:58] then evangelist Sami go away for two
[1:02:59] years like Nehemiah did I'm gonna go
[1:03:02] away for two years I'm gonna come back
[1:03:03] and the Evangelist comes back two years
[1:03:05] later well two years ago you came right
[1:03:09] to the altar right here and you laid all
[1:03:12] this stuff down I know I come back two
[1:03:16] years later I found out that you've just
[1:03:17] you kicked out all the ties you kept out
[1:03:20] all the offerings you kicked out all the
[1:03:23] good things you gave to God and you
[1:03:25] brought back in all this stuff to the
[1:03:26] enemy he put it right back in and
[1:03:28] Nehemiah says yeah we get down to the to
[1:03:32] the end of the chapter and Nehemiah you
[1:03:33] know what it says he says and I laid
[1:03:35] hands on him and then one he wasn't
[1:03:43] praying for him he grabbed him by the
[1:03:45] shirt coat and he threw him out of the
[1:03:47] temple he laid hands on it he says Oh
[1:03:51] Lord remember me for good because I have
[1:03:54] had a zeal for the house of God I love
[1:03:58] that well that last chapter in Nehemiah
[1:04:00] he's like you can just see he's wore out
[1:04:02] he's tried he's tried he's like the
[1:04:04] Evangelist he's tried he's preached he's
[1:04:07] tried to keep the house clean and he's
[1:04:09] gotten all the junk out of the house
[1:04:10] he's tried to prepare a bride for for
[1:04:14] jehovah and he says remember me at the
[1:04:17] end he says remember me O Lord for good
[1:04:20] and every single one of us wants to be
[1:04:24] in that same condition Lord I've tried
[1:04:26] to keep the house clean Lord remember me
[1:04:29] for good remember me for the sealing of
[1:04:32] the Holy Ghost I remember me that when
[1:04:34] the Holy Spirit comes into the city
[1:04:36] remember me Lord that that when you are
[1:04:39] here to do a work in the city that I am
[1:04:41] here Lord I am available I've tried to
[1:04:44] keep my heart clean my lord and I've
[1:04:45] realized that my own trying is faulty my
[1:04:48] own trying is worthless as hard as I try
[1:04:50] I just can't keep myself clean enough I
[1:04:53] can't see keep myself worthy enough I
[1:04:55] can't keep myself good enough Oh Lord
[1:04:58] I'm just laying it all down Lord forgive
[1:05:00] me Lord cleanse me Lord fill me with
[1:05:03] your spirit Lord put a wall
[1:05:05] fire around about me Lord keep the
[1:05:07] temptation away from me Lord keep the
[1:05:09] deceiver away from my heart's door I am
[1:05:11] preparing my house Lord for you Lord and
[1:05:14] for you alone Lord I'm casting away all
[1:05:17] the foolishness Lord I'm casting away
[1:05:19] all the the wickedness out of my house
[1:05:22] Lord all the things that I've done wrong
[1:05:24] Lord I'm laying them down once more Lord
[1:05:26] come and fill the house Lord put up the
[1:05:29] wall of fire around about me Lord fill
[1:05:31] me and make me clean
[1:05:32] Lord oh I'm casting away my foolishness
[1:05:35] Lord because I know that the Holy Spirit
[1:05:38] is coming to the house and I want you to
[1:05:40] seal this place and I want you to
[1:05:43] cleanse this place and I want this to be
[1:05:45] a place as prepared not for the enemy
[1:05:47] but for a God himself to come and live
[1:05:51] and dwell and move and have his bean let
[1:05:54] that be the place why because we know
[1:05:57] that the Spirit is coming well Oh Lord
[1:05:59] what condition will we be in when he
[1:06:01] comes God has made an appointment for
[1:06:06] this - an appointment for this church
[1:06:09] God has made an appointment for every
[1:06:11] one of us there will be a time of
[1:06:14] refreshing for every person amen and
[1:06:17] when that time refreshing comes what
[1:06:19] condition will you be ain't it when when
[1:06:22] revival comes and strikes to church when
[1:06:25] everybody starts jumping up as shouting
[1:06:27] and praised in the Lord will you be like
[1:06:28] oh I shouldn't have done such and such
[1:06:30] today oh I wish I had been more clean
[1:06:32] cleaning and sanctified today oh I wish
[1:06:34] I had done this and that know when the
[1:06:36] Holy Spirit begins to move upon the
[1:06:38] bride don't be in that place don't be
[1:06:41] the one that has to make excuses don't
[1:06:43] be the one that has to wonder oh I wish
[1:06:45] I hadn't done this wish i under that I
[1:06:47] wish I'd been more ready for the moving
[1:06:49] of the waters I wish I'd been more ready
[1:06:51] for the move to the spirit no but be
[1:06:53] that one that comes into the house of
[1:06:55] the Lord
[1:06:56] ready you got your lick of fire ready
[1:06:58] upon the altar you've washed away your
[1:07:01] sins and the blood of the Lamb you're
[1:07:03] you you've carried yourself on the side
[1:07:05] of the righteous you set down your
[1:07:07] expecting that all of your enemies will
[1:07:09] be placed under your feet why because
[1:07:11] you're underneath the blood of the Lamb
[1:07:12] and you're sitting with Christ in his
[1:07:14] throne and you know where you stand why
[1:07:17] because you've made thing
[1:07:18] ready you've made things right and
[1:07:20] you're not harboring little places in
[1:07:22] your heart for the enemy amen
[1:07:25] casting away all of our foolishness why
[1:07:27] the Holy Spirit is coming amen amen but
[1:07:30] we ought to be a people as prepared and
[1:07:32] ready so when the Holy Spirit does come
[1:07:35] that he'll have a place a house to move
[1:07:37] in amen Nehemiah knew that that was the
[1:07:42] time of restoration
[1:07:43] he knew the vision he know he knew what
[1:07:46] was coming because every time throughout
[1:07:48] the Bible every time God restored his
[1:07:50] house he was restoring it so the pillar
[1:07:53] of fire could come down to the house a
[1:07:56] man he knew that was coming but the by
[1:07:59] Elijah was not having the same vision
[1:08:02] think about it if that man Elijah should
[1:08:05] have had the oversight of the house of
[1:08:08] God if he had signed up if he is in tune
[1:08:11] with the vision he wouldn't have done
[1:08:13] such a thing but there's always two
[1:08:17] different types of people in the church
[1:08:18] amen but we're not here to be that other
[1:08:21] type of person we're here to live
[1:08:24] ourselves live our lives clean for the
[1:08:26] Gospels sake amen amen
[1:08:33] Matthew 18 for jesus said verily i say
[1:08:37] unto you that except you be converted
[1:08:40] and become as little children is she not
[1:08:44] enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:53] you
[1:09:07] and how good we've done this and that
[1:09:09] but let me tell you if the Holy Spirit
[1:09:11] is not doing it it's all in foolishness
[1:09:13] it's all envy amen but if you can just
[1:09:16] let the Holy Spirit have his work in you
[1:09:18] when you're on your knees when you're in
[1:09:22] your prayer closet all alone and God is
[1:09:24] preparing your heart and working in
[1:09:26] through you and then all of a sudden you
[1:09:29] who put yourself in secret God will
[1:09:33] begin to reward you openly amen I'll
[1:09:37] never forget that time in Brazil we were
[1:09:42] at a a convention and there was probably
[1:09:50] a hundred and 150 different churches
[1:09:53] people from different churches had
[1:09:55] gathered to one place for this
[1:09:56] convention there's I think two or three
[1:10:00] thousand if I recall maybe five thousand
[1:10:02] there at the Billings with another
[1:10:05] twenty five thousand watching over the
[1:10:06] Internet
[1:10:07] huge convention and had a huge
[1:10:12] auditorium there was enough room in the
[1:10:14] auditorium it was bigger this entire
[1:10:17] building the were in and could probably
[1:10:23] fit almost ten in these little buildings
[1:10:25] inside that one and I had been told that
[1:10:32] that evening that we were invited to eat
[1:10:37] and everybody they were going to feed
[1:10:40] all the thousands of people but we were
[1:10:43] invited to not eat with all the rest but
[1:10:46] we were actually invited to eat with the
[1:10:48] pastor of that church at his state and
[1:10:50] he had a little room with about two
[1:10:52] tables in it and room probably thirty
[1:10:55] people to sit out of those five thousand
[1:10:57] and and I me and this other brother were
[1:11:02] from Brazil we were gonna we were an
[1:11:04] expectation that we were going to sit in
[1:11:05] that room but then when the time come we
[1:11:09] didn't know exactly where that room was
[1:11:11] there was a big place and we got
[1:11:14] separated from the group and it was time
[1:11:16] to eat and we didn't know how to get
[1:11:17] there
[1:11:17] and so my
[1:11:21] brother was a little upset or a little
[1:11:25] perturbed I suppose he felt like he
[1:11:28] should have been there and yeah we
[1:11:32] didn't have anything else to do we were
[1:11:33] hungry so we went and got in line about
[1:11:35] time the line was already you know three
[1:11:38] city blocks long or whatever and and so
[1:11:44] we were standing in that line and he was
[1:11:46] I could tell he was just a little bummed
[1:11:47] a little put out that we weren't where
[1:11:51] we were supposed to be we had to eat
[1:11:52] with everybody else and I was just so
[1:11:55] inspired and I says don't don't ever
[1:11:59] worry about taking last place always let
[1:12:04] God exalt you because you put yourself
[1:12:08] in the last place and then you give God
[1:12:11] the chance to exalt you you don't have
[1:12:15] to lift yourself up just put yourself in
[1:12:18] the last place and take your place
[1:12:20] willingly
[1:12:21] and then give God room to exalt you he's
[1:12:25] like okay I can do that brother and just
[1:12:28] within a minute of saying that some man
[1:12:31] comes walk up to us and says what are
[1:12:33] you doing here you're supposed to be
[1:12:35] over there you know the room and he came
[1:12:37] and he took us out of the line and came
[1:12:39] and put us at the pastor's table and as
[1:12:43] we were eating their eyes like brother
[1:12:44] do you realize what I said there was a
[1:12:46] prophecy God was speaking teaching us
[1:12:54] both a little lesson we don't have to
[1:12:57] push we don't have to try but relax keep
[1:13:02] your house clean before the Lord let him
[1:13:06] exalt you let him do the play see main
[1:13:10] will generally be doing what they're
[1:13:12] called to do why because God is leading
[1:13:14] them as they pray and read their Bible
[1:13:16] amen God is leading them and they'll be
[1:13:18] worried no should I be this or should I
[1:13:21] be doing this and worry about this and
[1:13:23] all the time God is just leading them
[1:13:25] God is leading them a lot of times they
[1:13:27] don't even know it a lot of times God's
[1:13:29] people are already doing what God called
[1:13:31] them to do and they're over there
[1:13:33] worrying about what God is calling them
[1:13:35] to do I see it over and over again it's
[1:13:39] throughout Christendom god has his
[1:13:40] people all over the place and half of
[1:13:43] them are worrying about what they ought
[1:13:45] to be doing the Holy Spirit's already
[1:13:46] leading them right where they're
[1:13:47] supposed to be relax
[1:13:50] settle down let God place you where you
[1:13:54] ought to be because you just trust in
[1:13:57] the Lord
[1:13:58] sit down and expect until your enemies
[1:14:02] become your footstool because that's
[1:14:05] what your Lord is doing and you are you
[1:14:08] and him or we're flesh of his flesh and
[1:14:09] we're bone of his bone right amen amen
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:17] everybody wants to be and believes that
[1:14:21] they are brought to believe that way
[1:14:23] that there are overcomers but overcoming
[1:14:26] has nothing to do with your physical or
[1:14:29] mental ability to keep yourself but it's
[1:14:35] your ability to surrender to the holy
[1:14:37] spirit of the Living God amen amen so
[1:14:42] you got a humble yourself and come as a
[1:14:44] little child in order to enter into the
[1:14:47] kingdom of heaven and that's how you
[1:14:50] become the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:14:53] heaven every child must be tested tried
[1:14:58] chastened why God wants to see what
[1:15:04] direction you will run when things get
[1:15:07] rough and find out if deep down inside
[1:15:11] your heart in those little chambers if
[1:15:14] nir is faith or unbelief and when the
[1:15:20] trial comes that's going to find out
[1:15:24] whether that little chamber it has faith
[1:15:27] in there or unbelief faith in there or
[1:15:33] fear faith or doubt I have someone that
[1:15:40] I know that is on the fence between
[1:15:43] atheism and Christianity they don't know
[1:15:47] way to go there on the fence and they
[1:15:49] know it and they were complaining about
[1:15:53] the Christian Church to me and saying
[1:15:56] well why do churches do this and why do
[1:15:57] they do that and I say well you know
[1:16:02] there's really only two kinds of
[1:16:05] churches for people in the church its
[1:16:08] believers and unbelievers make believers
[1:16:10] you know and they're all going to be
[1:16:12] divided out in their times you know
[1:16:15] there's only two spirits in the church
[1:16:17] and but really the people in the church
[1:16:21] are either operating by fear or faith
[1:16:24] and a lot of the wicked things you hear
[1:16:27] about going on in the churches that
[1:16:29] cause people to think they have an
[1:16:31] excuse to go towards atheism is caused
[1:16:35] by the see people operating by fear and
[1:16:41] it's like someone I know someone that
[1:16:43] recently passed away they were they took
[1:16:48] I had heard once that when they were a
[1:16:50] child that they had gone to a Baptist
[1:16:53] sunday-school and the minister took all
[1:16:57] the children in a back room and had him
[1:16:59] whole out their hands he burned them all
[1:17:00] with the lighter and says this is what
[1:17:01] hell will feel like and tried to and he
[1:17:05] tried to get them to heaven through fear
[1:17:08] you know and pain and torment but let me
[1:17:12] tell you I don't think that's a
[1:17:13] witnessing tool you know but in reality
[1:17:17] think about what was going to that that
[1:17:19] ministers mind to do such a thing he was
[1:17:23] afraid that he couldn't get the children
[1:17:26] to believe the way he believed and so
[1:17:30] and because he couldn't convince them
[1:17:32] with his words he thought he'd convince
[1:17:33] them with a lighter and so he's
[1:17:36] operating through fear but let me tell
[1:17:39] you we're not here to operate through
[1:17:40] fear and you can see that throughout the
[1:17:43] church there's really two different ways
[1:17:46] a minister can operate fear through fear
[1:17:49] or through faith and any when you when
[1:17:53] you spot people operating through fear
[1:17:55] then just well that's about all they can
[1:17:58] do but let me tell you we're not here to
[1:18:00] operate that way
[1:18:01] we're here to operate through the faith
[1:18:03] with all of thy God why because that's
[1:18:04] what is dwelling on the chambers of the
[1:18:06] heart amen
[1:18:11] every child must be tested and tried and
[1:18:14] chastened because it will see what
[1:18:16] direction you run to when the pressure
[1:18:20] comes when you are tested and tried
[1:18:22] where are you going to go into which
[1:18:24] direction are you going to go we're in
[1:18:26] the tough when the turn when the going
[1:18:28] gets tough would you trust in the Lord
[1:18:30] you place it on the Lord or you begin to
[1:18:33] wander or fear do you begin to think
[1:18:34] well Who am I am I really saved or am i
[1:18:37] this I my that well you ought to have
[1:18:39] that old cell before the tests comes
[1:18:41] amen amen brother Ram said once he says
[1:18:48] what is that little thing that comes and
[1:18:51] takes away the first little difficulty
[1:18:54] that comes your way what is that little
[1:18:56] thing that comes and takes it all away
[1:18:57] from you well first they'll try out
[1:19:00] Austin yes God finds you sitting back
[1:19:03] down on the floor first little a trial
[1:19:07] or test comes by all sudden you're just
[1:19:09] defeated what cause is that it's because
[1:19:12] faith isn't in there in that little
[1:19:14] inner chamber
[1:19:16] amen amen
[1:19:20] let's turn over to 2nd Kings here in
[1:19:24] closing I preached on this a long time
[1:19:28] ago
[1:19:29] it was last year sometime about making
[1:19:34] room for the Word of God at second Kings
[1:19:41] I love this story story of Elijah and
[1:19:44] and this shunammite woman and in second
[1:19:51] Kings chapter 4 verse 8 it says
[1:20:04] you
[1:21:03] the thing about it is is this prophet of
[1:21:06] God Elijah you say he lives over here at
[1:21:09] point eight and God would tell him I
[1:21:12] want you to go over here and do this
[1:21:14] once you go over here and do this always
[1:21:17] being led of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:21:20] God's children love to be led of the
[1:21:22] Holy Ghost it's one of the greatest joys
[1:21:24] in our life is when we can look back at
[1:21:27] a situation and realize that God was
[1:21:30] leading us all the way through there let
[1:21:33] me tell you there's nothing like it in
[1:21:34] the world there is absolutely nothing
[1:21:36] like that in the world there is almost
[1:21:37] no there's no experience like it when
[1:21:40] you look back and you realize oh my god
[1:21:43] had me do this and I turned to the right
[1:21:46] and I realized God had me do that now
[1:21:48] you look back he realized that God was
[1:21:50] just leading you all the way but the
[1:21:53] jesus said the Holy Spirit was like the
[1:21:55] wind
[1:21:55] nobody knows where he comes from nobody
[1:21:57] wears knows where he's going but and so
[1:22:00] are those that are led by the Holy
[1:22:01] Spirit or the same way they aren't know
[1:22:03] what people you can't tell where a Holy
[1:22:04] Spirit led man is gonna come where he's
[1:22:06] gonna go why because he's led by the
[1:22:08] Spirit of God and so was this man Elijah
[1:22:10] this prophet Elijah led by the Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost and frequently when he left his
[1:22:15] left his house he would go for a little
[1:22:19] why's down the road and he had passed by
[1:22:21] this woman's house and so he kept
[1:22:24] passing by and she realized that he was
[1:22:26] a righteous man and he was a holy man
[1:22:28] and and she had respects unto Jehovah so
[1:22:32] she began to invite him into her house
[1:22:34] to eat what a blessing to have a prophet
[1:22:39] of God coming eating at your house but
[1:22:43] then he would eat his meal and he would
[1:22:45] say well I got a keep on going down the
[1:22:47] road before the Sun sets like I have a
[1:22:49] place to go and rest so he would keep
[1:22:51] moving on down the road so he can get to
[1:22:54] his place that evening where he could
[1:22:56] sleep and the woman said yeah after a
[1:22:58] while seeing that she's like said to her
[1:23:00] husband she said you know I think we
[1:23:03] could get him to stay a little bit
[1:23:04] longer because you know if he didn't if
[1:23:07] he it'd be more of a blessing to us if
[1:23:11] we can be a blessing to God surrett we
[1:23:13] want to be a blessing to god's servant
[1:23:15] if we don't
[1:23:17] give him a meal but we also gave him a
[1:23:19] place to rest and so they she told her
[1:23:22] husband let's make an opening in our
[1:23:24] wall right here get out the saw and cut
[1:23:27] this little hole in the wall we're gonna
[1:23:28] make a little chamber add on to our
[1:23:30] house and we're gonna make this little
[1:23:32] room here and we're gonna put a little
[1:23:35] cot in here and and make a little table
[1:23:38] and we'll make a little stool for him to
[1:23:40] sit there at and a little lamp so he can
[1:23:43] sit and study by the by the fire and
[1:23:47] then he can go and I mean if he has to
[1:23:49] scroll with them or a few swans to pray
[1:23:51] there or wherever he wants to do and
[1:23:53] then ways gets tired he can rest on the
[1:23:56] cot and he can be at peace upon his
[1:23:58] journey and so it cut and they got
[1:24:01] everything all ready they they they
[1:24:03] prepared the stool and the cot and they
[1:24:05] made a little lamp there and they and
[1:24:07] they made the table and got everything
[1:24:09] ready and the chamber prepared and sure
[1:24:11] enough it wasn't that much longer that
[1:24:13] they heard the prophet of God walking
[1:24:16] down singing hymns unto Jehovah or joy
[1:24:19] seenin and praising God and on down the
[1:24:22] road and and then they and they saw him
[1:24:24] going by whistling or whatever he was
[1:24:26] doing it and he they invited me to
[1:24:29] supper and they said we've made you a
[1:24:31] little room so you don't have to stay
[1:24:36] just any old place under a tree
[1:24:39] somewhere but we want you to come in
[1:24:40] here and be comfortable and and in ear
[1:24:43] and welcome here anytime at all
[1:24:45] just come in here and be comfortable and
[1:24:46] they made a room for the Word of God to
[1:24:49] dwell in and so the Prophet he he goes
[1:24:53] into the little chamber and he lays down
[1:24:56] on the cot and the Bible says that in
[1:24:59] verse 11 there and it fell on a day that
[1:25:02] he came thither and he turned into that
[1:25:05] chamber and he laid down he laid there
[1:25:07] and is the Word of God as the prophet of
[1:25:11] God was resting there the whole sudden
[1:25:15] something came upon his mind and he
[1:25:20] called him to gaze a servant he says
[1:25:23] call this shunammite woman
[1:25:32] you
[1:27:02] often a God in your house in your heart
[1:27:03] a meteora it's good a good place for us
[1:27:08] to have room for the Word of God let me
[1:27:10] tell you when the Word of God comes into
[1:27:12] your heart what happens to it does it
[1:27:16] does it it doesn't maybe just come for a
[1:27:19] meal and you enjoy it and it keep on
[1:27:20] going
[1:27:21] or have you prepared a place for the
[1:27:25] word to come and stay to where you are
[1:27:27] in full agreement with the Word of God
[1:27:29] then whatever the word says you say yes
[1:27:32] and amen
[1:27:33] yes the name it yes that's nothing but
[1:27:35] the truth Lord not Lord that's the truth
[1:27:38] that is nothing about the truth I
[1:27:41] believe that I say yes the name into
[1:27:42] that is that your attitude towards the
[1:27:44] word you know are you or are you in the
[1:27:47] word a stranger you know what condition
[1:27:51] what what what have you laid up in the
[1:27:53] chambers of your heart well this woman
[1:27:54] here she she she made room for the word
[1:27:58] for the prophet in her heart and the
[1:28:02] Word of God enters into that chamber and
[1:28:04] as the word was resting all sudden he
[1:28:08] began to speak ask what you will
[1:28:10] whatever you want it should be done unto
[1:28:13] you
[1:28:13] whatever you want now that didn't happen
[1:28:16] when the word was just eating his meal
[1:28:17] and going on through but once she had
[1:28:22] made a room for God for God's servant
[1:28:28] upon the earth God's representative on
[1:28:31] the earth to come and dwell then it was
[1:28:34] asked whatsoever you will is that what
[1:28:38] happened to sister Hattie right when
[1:28:41] when when she heard about the acts of
[1:28:43] the Holy Spirit and the Prophet the
[1:28:45] things that the Holy Spirit had led him
[1:28:48] to do and she said that's nothing but
[1:28:50] the truth
[1:28:51] and there was God's representative right
[1:28:53] there in her house and she was giving
[1:28:56] him a meal and and he had been there
[1:28:58] with him so many times and he said she
[1:29:00] said the right thing let her know ask
[1:29:02] what you will it'll be unto you and she
[1:29:06] said well what should I ask
[1:29:08] he's ask whatever you want to ask
[1:29:10] anything right now
[1:29:12] million dollars ask you'll be right here
[1:29:15] he says that's that third Pole and let
[1:29:20] me tell you we are still living in those
[1:29:22] days God's representative is still on
[1:29:26] the earth it's the Holy Spirit of the
[1:29:29] Living God and we're not here just to
[1:29:32] enjoy a fine meal of the word in this
[1:29:35] church service then walk right out and
[1:29:37] let the Holy Spirit go as Mary wait but
[1:29:39] no we got to make a room in our heart
[1:29:42] for him and we're here we got to make
[1:29:44] room in our heart for the Holy Spirit
[1:29:46] maker all the Chamber's got any fill
[1:29:49] with the Holy Ghost and we're not here
[1:29:51] to reserve rooms for the enemy
[1:29:53] we're not here to resume reserve this
[1:29:56] little space this little thing for
[1:29:57] Tencent over here but we're down on her
[1:30:00] knees say O Lord God here oh my lord
[1:30:02] have mercy upon me from our sins Lord
[1:30:05] Lord I can't do it myself I can't keep
[1:30:08] myself clean well or it's here it's me

[1:30:16] am preparing my heart right now for you
[1:30:18] come and dwell in this place I am
[1:30:21] offering my heart upon your altar as a
[1:30:23] sacrifice so I could be a prisoner of
[1:30:26] the righteousness of the Almighty God or
[1:30:28] come and live and move on me and have
[1:30:30] your being or be mighty in me live in me
[1:30:33] one little nod Lord and I want to be
[1:30:35] about to your business
[1:30:36] Lord come and live in me I don't want to
[1:30:39] just enjoy you when the word is going
[1:30:40] forth over the pulpit Lord I don't want
[1:30:42] to just enjoy the sermons of the Most
[1:30:45] High God but then go off and do my own
[1:30:47] thing but Lord I want to be in
[1:30:48] partnership flesh of your flesh bone of
[1:30:51] your bone Lord I know the Holy Spirit is
[1:30:53] coming but when he comes I want my my
[1:30:56] spirits are already prepared for the
[1:30:58] revival are you repaired for the
[1:31:00] refreshing because the final revival is
[1:31:02] coming one of these days and that
[1:31:04] revival will not be just a rejoicing in
[1:31:06] the church not be just a powerful act
[1:31:09] amongst us people the city but it'll be
[1:31:11] a catching away when we are revived
[1:31:14] renewed and then transformed in a moment
[1:31:16] in a twinkling of an eye to come exactly
[1:31:19] and be transformed according to the
[1:31:22] vision because the day is coming
[1:31:25] but what condition will your heart being
[1:31:27] when that
[1:31:28] comes will you be trying to live your
[1:31:31] own life or will be the Holy Spirit
[1:31:33] pushing out from you
[1:31:34] a man prepare your own heart cast away
[1:31:37] all your foolishness I'm a crew for the
[1:31:40] Holy Spirit amen remember the sermon you
[1:31:45] know digging the ditches you know and
[1:31:47] brother Ram we preach that sermon I
[1:31:49] already member what the name of the
[1:31:50] sermon was but but uh but uh he's
[1:31:55] talking about that time when the Prophet
[1:31:57] I think as in jehosophat's day when they
[1:32:01] were fighting and in the in the dry
[1:32:03] valley in the desert and they were in
[1:32:06] the valley and they were didn't have any
[1:32:07] water and they were getting faint and
[1:32:09] they were getting ready to lose the
[1:32:10] battle because they had no water and and
[1:32:14] the Prophet said Allison had a vision he
[1:32:17] says water is coming through the dry
[1:32:20] Valley and they went to Jehoshaphat and
[1:32:23] he said water will come rushing down to
[1:32:26] this valley for a short period of time
[1:32:28] but the only way it will stick around is
[1:32:32] if you dig this valley full of ditches
[1:32:35] and he says if you dig this full of
[1:32:37] valley full of ditches when the water
[1:32:39] comes they'll fill them all and you'll
[1:32:42] have water for the rest of the battle
[1:32:44] the rest of this month while we're here
[1:32:45] and so they went and they dug and
[1:32:47] however deep they dug that's how much
[1:32:49] water the head and sure enough after
[1:32:51] they dug all the ditches your brother
[1:32:53] Brandon who hate the little drama movie
[1:32:55] he says they would hit a little rock of
[1:32:57] unbelief and they would just picked that
[1:32:59] rock up and throw it off to the side
[1:33:00] yeah this little rock here of this
[1:33:02] little pet sand and this will that and
[1:33:04] this little trouble and they get it out
[1:33:06] of the way why because the water is
[1:33:08] coming and as soon as the water the time
[1:33:10] of refreshing has come
[1:33:11] however they dug their ditch that's the
[1:33:13] water they got and the time of
[1:33:15] refreshing come is sure enough the
[1:33:17] ditches were filled amen and they were
[1:33:19] refreshed and renewed I believe that
[1:33:22] God's time or refreshing is going to
[1:33:24] come and
[1:33:26] and we those that are already filled
[1:33:29] with the Holy Ghost will be the ones and
[1:33:32] going to the inner chamber with it amen
[1:33:36] but those that are keeping their hearts
[1:33:38] chambers trying to split the fence their
[1:33:42] folly will be made known amen
[1:33:45] let's just stand we all of us ought to
[1:33:51] be making room for the Spirit of God in
[1:33:54] our lives so every time the spirit has a
[1:33:57] desire to move and live and have his
[1:33:59] being in the city in the place and the
[1:34:01] home wherever he has someone to work
[1:34:04] through someone to live through and that
[1:34:06] person is us so we can become the people
[1:34:09] of God we can become God still has Bible
[1:34:12] characters upon this earth a man there's
[1:34:14] still Timothy's and Mary's and Martha's
[1:34:16] they're still Saint Paul's and and
[1:34:19] Peters upon the earth they're still in
[1:34:22] Oxon and Elijah and Elijah's upon the
[1:34:25] earth amen and it's me it's you it's us
[1:34:29] and it's the people that the Holy Spirit
[1:34:33] has the ability to move in and live in
[1:34:36] and have a place foxes have dens birds
[1:34:43] there's the nests jesus said the Son of
[1:34:46] man has no place to lay his head
[1:34:48] but there is coming a pyramid that is
[1:34:53] prepared throughout all the ages and she
[1:34:58] is preparing for the capstone come down
[1:35:01] as we see the little drawing on the wall
[1:35:05] our brother Isiah preached Sunday and
[1:35:08] when that cat stone comes down upon the
[1:35:11] pyramid the bottom of that capstone the
[1:35:15] capstone is Christ but the bottom of
[1:35:18] that capstone has to match up perfectly
[1:35:20] with the top of the pyramid and the top
[1:35:24] of the pyramid that church and the last
[1:35:26] days will be honed and prepared and
[1:35:30] cleaned and that this corner of the top
[1:35:33] of the pyramid will meet up with this
[1:35:34] corner of the capstone in each corner
[1:35:37] meeting up with this corner and she will
[1:35:40] look so much like him it should be
[1:35:43] sealed and she'll pull down God out of
[1:35:45] heaven amen and then and the two will be
[1:35:48] made one United awaiting supper will
[1:35:53] take place but let us speed not those
[1:35:56] that are weeping and wailing and
[1:35:58] gnashing of teeth blessed be those that
[1:36:00] are filled with the Holy Ghost because
