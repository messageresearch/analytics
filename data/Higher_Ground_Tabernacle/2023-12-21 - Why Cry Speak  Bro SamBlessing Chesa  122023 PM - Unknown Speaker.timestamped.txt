[48:57] the children of Israel lifted up their
[49:03] eyes and behold the Egyptians marched
[49:06] after them and they were so afraid and
[49:08] the children of Israel Cried Out unto
[49:11] the
[49:16] Lord and they said unto
[49:19] Moses because there were no graves in
[49:23] Egypt has thou taken us away to die in
[49:26] the
[49:28] [Music]
[49:30] wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus
[49:33] with
[49:35] us to carry us forth out of
[49:39] Egypt is not this the word that we did
[49:43] tell thee in
[49:46] Egypt saying let us
[49:49] alone that we may serve the
[49:53] Egyptians for it had been better for us
[49:55] to to serve the
[49:57] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[50:01] wilderness me you can take your seats we
[50:04] continue reading you
[50:07] SE in the in the scripture that we
[50:10] reading the children of Israel were
[50:12] about to cross the Red
[50:16] Sea and they saw the enemy drawing up
[50:19] close to
[50:20] them and they started
[50:24] shaking
[50:26] they started
[50:28] crying to say why are we being
[50:33] delivered we were better off where we
[50:35] were
[50:36] at amen they forgot all the goodness
[50:39] that God had done for
[50:42] them they forgot all the Miracles that
[50:44] had
[50:46] happened their first bones did not die
[50:48] they forgot about
[50:51] that at the first sight of
[50:54] danger they were crying and
[50:58] whining and they forgot what God did for
[51:02] them in verse
[51:05] 13 Moses said unto the
[51:08] people fear
[51:10] not stand
[51:12] still and see the
[51:17] Salvation which he will show to you
[51:20] today for the Egyptians whom you have
[51:23] seen
[51:24] today you shall see them again no
[51:27] more amen amen Moses was speaking with
[51:32] authority he was speaking as a man who
[51:35] has been
[51:37] commissioned because he knew the God he
[51:39] had met on the backside of the
[51:43] Des the god of Abraham Isaac and
[51:47] Jacob amen amen verse 14 he says the
[51:51] Lord shall fight for
[51:53] you and he shall hold your
[51:58] peace and the Lord said unto
[52:01] Moses wherefore CEST thou unto
[52:04] me speak unto the children of Israel
[52:08] that they go
[52:09] forward amen amen my title this evening
[52:12] is why cist
[52:15] speak amen amen this is what the Lord
[52:18] was telling
[52:20] Moses after all the Miracles you've seen
[52:22] me
[52:24] do I have never forsaken you
[52:28] before why are you crying
[52:31] today amen amen stop crying speak the
[52:36] word speak the word and go
[52:39] forth that's all you have to do you
[52:42] don't have to worry what's going to
[52:43] happen after you speak the
[52:47] word because he's the one who's doing
[52:49] the
[52:51] work amen amen Moses knew he had met the
[52:54] god of Abraham
[52:57] he met God of
[52:59] Isaac that's how God introduced himself
[53:02] to
[53:06] AB when he was saying I'm the god of
[53:10] Abraham the first thought that would get
[53:12] into their
[53:14] head was what did this God accomplish in
[53:18] Abraham's
[53:21] life what did this God accomplish in
[53:24] Isaac's life
[53:27] what did he accomplish in Jacob's
[53:30] life we know Abraham is the father of
[53:34] Faith all the victories he
[53:37] won they were all attributed to God so
[53:41] God was bragging on
[53:43] Abraham he was bragging on Isaac and
[53:47] Jacob say I am their
[53:50] God God wants to do the same thing with
[53:53] you he wants to be your
[53:56] God so why are you crying speak the word
[54:01] he is the one who's doing the
[54:04] work he is the one performing The
[54:07] Miracles amen amen because he's the god
[54:10] of the
[54:13] again God of
[54:16] president if he did it before he can do
[54:20] it
[54:20] again Sarah was Barren for 25 years sah
[54:26] and she got a
[54:28] baby God waited until it came to a point
[54:31] in time where it was
[54:35] impossible medically it's impossible for
[54:38] a woman that old to Bear
[54:44] children but God waited until
[54:48] then and she gave birth to
[54:51] Isaac Rebecca was also Barren for 20
[54:54] years
[54:56] but they believe the god of Abraham and
[55:00] Sarah could do it
[55:03] again God opened the womb of
[55:08] Rebecca what he did for Sarah he did for
[55:12] Rebecca Rael was also Barren for 14
[55:16] years but they did not give
[55:19] hope because they knew the god of
[55:21] Abraham and Sarah the god of Isaac and
[55:24] Rebecca
[55:26] if he could open their
[55:28] womb she knew my womb could be open
[55:31] too you are no different this
[55:35] evening if God Did It for Abraham and
[55:38] Sarah Isaac and
[55:40] Rebecca Jacob and
[55:43] Rachel he can do the same thing for you
[55:46] this because he is the god of the
[55:50] aain Hallelujah Hallelujah so when Moses
[55:53] was there he knew he was speaking he had
[55:56] been sent by the god of
[55:59] Abraham so if he did that before for
[56:03] Abraham he knew he could do that in his
[56:05] ministry
[56:08] too he knew he had a
[56:11] commission he was
[56:14] anointed and he did not worry about what
[56:16] was going to happen after he
[56:20] spoke because it was all up to
[56:23] God
[56:26] so you and me this
[56:28] evening we have a
[56:31] commission God gives you a
[56:34] commission he anoints you for that
[56:38] job he gives you action to go carry out
[56:41] what he has brought you here
[56:45] for in paragraph 30 of why Christ
[56:49] [Music]
[56:51] speak the prophet of God says Moses was
[56:53] born in this world
[56:57] GI
[56:59] boy he was born to be a
[57:03] prophet a
[57:06] deliverer he was born with equipment
[57:09] born in
[57:13] him as every man that comes into the
[57:16] world is born with this
[57:20] equipment is I firmly believe in the for
[57:23] knowledge the predestination
[57:25] as I firmly believe in full
[57:28] knowledge and
[57:30] predestination so when you were born on
[57:33] this
[57:34] Earth God gave you everything that you
[57:37] needed for your
[57:39] commission he has given you the
[57:42] anointing that you
[57:44] need to
[57:46] overcome everything you need for the
[57:49] Rapture is lying in you you just have to
[57:53] realize
[57:56] that God has given you the
[57:59] equipment he has equipped you to carry
[58:03] out that
[58:04] commission what's your
[58:06] commission why are you crying don't cry
[58:09] you speak the
[58:11] word hallelujah hallelujah because he
[58:14] gave us the
[58:15] authority so Moses knew he had that
[58:19] commission he was not afraid he spoke
[58:22] with
[58:23] authority he spoke with
[58:30] confidence amen because he was
[58:32] anointed he was given that commission by
[58:35] the
[58:37] Lord and when God gives you the
[58:40] commission he doesn't leave you to go
[58:43] alone he comes with you because he's the
[58:47] one who's going to do
[58:50] it in the Old Testament they called him
[58:52] God With Us
[58:56] they called him God above
[58:57] us amen he was close to
[59:00] them so when they would go to carry out
[59:03] the
[59:05] commission they knew God was above
[59:08] them but we are in the New
[59:11] Testament it's a different Covenant Al
[59:15] together when God sends you he doesn't
[59:18] come above you he comes right inside of
[59:23] you and he's the one to do
[59:25] it because he doesn't want you to mess
[59:28] it
[59:28] up so all you have to do realize you
[59:31] have that
[59:34] commission amen Paul said approach
[59:36] boldly Before the Throne of
[59:40] God because you know you are anointed
[59:42] for the
[59:44] job has equipped you with everything
[59:46] that you
[59:48] need so there is not enough devils not
[59:52] enough
[59:53] demons
[59:56] that can stand in your
[59:58] way amen amen and when God gives you a
[1:00:02] commission make sure you do it God's
[1:00:07] way you do it your own way you are
[1:00:13] determined Moses tried it his own
[1:00:17] way he wanted to deliver one
[1:00:21] man and he ended up failing
[1:00:25] he had the right
[1:00:27] Revelation but he was going about it the
[1:00:29] wrong
[1:00:31] way he
[1:00:33] failed and the children of Israel ended
[1:00:35] up being in bondage for 430 years
[1:00:38] instead of 400
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:44] years because Moses was trying to put
[1:00:47] maters into into his own
[1:00:50] hand don't do it by
[1:00:53] yourself do it God God's
[1:00:55] way and you are guaranteed of his
[1:01:01] success he will see you through
[1:01:04] amen and the children of
[1:01:07] Israel had always been seeing God's
[1:01:10] miracles in their
[1:01:12] life a chosen
[1:01:15] nation and you know we Are Spiritual
[1:01:20] Israel all the promises that God gave to
[1:01:23] Abraham
[1:01:25] they appli to you and
[1:01:27] me amen amen the Covenant God gave
[1:01:31] Abraham it applies to us as
[1:01:34] well why because the Bible tells us that
[1:01:37] we are the Seed of
[1:01:40] Abraham and we realize after the
[1:01:42] children of Israel had crossed the Red
[1:01:47] Sea they came to a point in
[1:01:50] time it was
[1:01:53] dry they didn't have have any
[1:01:55] water and they forgot
[1:01:58] again that The God Who had opened the
[1:02:01] Red
[1:02:02] Sea The God Who had given them
[1:02:06] provision he was able to do the same
[1:02:09] thing
[1:02:11] again because he is the god of the
[1:02:14] again in numbers 20 chapter
[1:02:19] 8 God told
[1:02:22] Moses take the rod
[1:02:25] and gather thou the assembly
[1:02:27] together thou and th and Aaron thy
[1:02:32] brother and speak ye unto the
[1:02:36] rock before their
[1:02:40] eyes and he shall give forth his
[1:02:44] water he didn't say cry to the
[1:02:48] rock you speak to that rock and it will
[1:02:52] give you water
[1:02:55] amen bring forth to them water out of
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:59] rock so thou sh give the congregation
[1:03:02] and their Beast
[1:03:05] drink we know Moses ended up beating
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:09] rock but that was not the
[1:03:12] Commandment the Commandment was for him
[1:03:14] to
[1:03:16] speak because that was God's way of
[1:03:23] provision he was providing what they
[1:03:28] lack because he had a covenant with
[1:03:32] them he told when he introduced himself
[1:03:35] to
[1:03:36] Moses Moses said who are
[1:03:39] you God says I am that I
[1:03:45] am that was a covenant
[1:03:49] name I am means
[1:03:53] becoming
[1:03:57] becoming then it's
[1:03:59] blank why would he leave it
[1:04:03] blank that's for you to fill out that
[1:04:07] blank he was saying I am becoming your
[1:04:15] provider not was but becoming means
[1:04:21] today that's why he gave them the seven
[1:04:23] compound Redemptive
[1:04:26] names I I am your
[1:04:30] provider whenever you I need I'll give
[1:04:33] it to

[1:04:37] will give you

[1:05:42] you he is there for you just call on his
[1:05:48] name that was the Covenant in the Old
[1:05:51] Testament but now in the New Testament
[1:05:55] you don't have to remember all those
[1:05:57] names you just have to call on the name
[1:05:59] of
[1:06:01] Jesus he is my all and

[1:06:08] my he is
[1:06:10] my whenever you need
[1:06:14] anything call on the name

[1:06:28] room when the doctors don't know how
[1:06:33] to he is the greatest
[1:06:35] doctor you got to trust that
[1:06:39] doctor amen amen the prophet of God
[1:06:42] gives us this
[1:06:44] analogy he says if you are given two
[1:06:48] doctors one who's pretty young with
[1:06:50] Sleek
[1:06:53] hair and one who's
[1:06:56] old who do you
[1:06:59] choose you don't got to think about
[1:07:01] it I'm GNA pick the one who's got more
[1:07:05] experience I'm going to look at how you
[1:07:08] look because I need to
[1:07:11] live I'm not trying to die I'm trying to
[1:07:15] survive so I'll call on the one who has
[1:07:19] more and no one has more experience than
[1:07:22] doctor Jesus
[1:07:25] he has never failed one
[1:07:28] operation he has never failed to heal
[1:07:30] one
[1:07:32] person amen Amen brother Keith when you

[1:07:47] got
[1:07:48] cancer why because that was Doctor
[1:07:51] Jesus call him on the scene
[1:07:54] he will transform your
[1:07:56] life he will change everything
[1:07:59] amen you can call him my lawyer in the
[1:08:03] cour he's both lawyer and
[1:08:08] judge after advocating for
[1:08:12] you you come around and you'll say not
[1:08:16] guilty did not do it in the first
[1:08:20] place so it doesn't matter how much

[1:09:05] life everyone might have a say in what
[1:09:07] you were going
[1:09:11] through they allowed to have a
[1:09:14] say but because Jesus is
[1:09:18] Sovereign they might have a say but he
[1:09:21] has the say
[1:09:24] because he because he is Sovereign
[1:09:27] Hallelujah so whatever verdict that is

[1:16:03] sheep whilst he was hurting
[1:16:08] ship prophet Samuel visited the house of

[1:19:51] country
[1:19:54] they have to call the government of that

[1:20:52] quot
[1:20:53] paragraph
[1:20:55] 257 the prophet of God
[1:21:00] say David he knew he was
[1:21:03] anointed and was Vindicated to be a good
[1:21:09] Shar he know that they knew he was a
[1:21:11] good
[1:21:14] shot David was anointed and knew
[1:21:19] it and when he stood before Goliath
[1:21:24] he never cried oh God what must I do
[1:21:28] now he just said I know what you did in
[1:21:31] the past
[1:21:35] times you let me kill a bear you let me
[1:21:39] kill a
[1:21:40] lion what about this Goliath out
[1:21:43] here he never
[1:21:46] cried never
[1:21:48] that he just
[1:21:51] spoke and he told
[1:21:53] Goliath you will be just like what they
[1:21:57] were amen amen why was David so
[1:22:03] confident you know when he knelt down in
[1:22:06] the house of his father
[1:22:10] Jesse he was anointed to be a
[1:22:14] king so there was nothing that was going
[1:22:18] to take David's life until he became a
[1:22:21] king
[1:22:24] so his anointing was his
[1:22:28] protection he could get
[1:22:31] Reckless he could go fight
[1:22:35] lions because he knew that anointing was
[1:22:37] protecting
[1:22:39] him his commission was protecting
[1:22:43] him he could go fight
[1:22:46] Bears no bear could kill
[1:22:49] him because he knew he was anointed
[1:22:54] and though after being anointed he went
[1:22:55] back into the to to head
[1:23:00] sheep and he continued that he didn't
[1:23:03] rush for
[1:23:05] it you got to be patient for your
[1:23:10] blessing God's
[1:23:13] timing God's timing is the best in your
[1:23:17] life know what and when is best for
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:24] his father called him and say go give
[1:23:27] food to your to your brothers who are in
[1:23:34] the and he went he was door dashing some
[1:23:39] food and he got
[1:23:42] there he sees all the
[1:23:45] soldiers from the King to the very last
[1:23:49] one they are running away they are
[1:23:54] hiding from
[1:23:56] Goliath and he asked who is
[1:23:59] that who is defying the name of the
[1:24:02] Living
[1:24:06] God they told him oh is this this man
[1:24:13] called David remembered I have an
[1:24:19] anointing he was anointed to be king
[1:24:24] even if you ran towards the
[1:24:27] giant nothing was going to
[1:24:30] happen why because he was not going to
[1:24:32] die until he became
[1:24:36] king his anointing was his
[1:24:40] protection the anointing on your life is
[1:24:43] your
[1:24:45] protection nothing will happen to you
[1:24:47] until God is done with
[1:24:51] you
[1:24:53] the prophet of God says you will not
[1:24:55] leave 5 minutes longer on this Earth
[1:24:57] after you have accomplish your
[1:25:02] purpose so so long you are looking at me
[1:25:05] right
[1:25:07] now so long you are breathing right
[1:25:10] now God's not yet done with
[1:25:14] you God's not yet done with
[1:25:17] you you got to accomplish that
[1:25:19] commission he
[1:25:21] gave
[1:25:22] amen amen so David that's why he went
[1:25:25] and he
[1:25:26] says what's going to be given to the man
[1:25:28] who fights this
[1:25:32] guy he already
[1:25:34] knew he already knew the
[1:25:38] outcome why because he was
[1:25:41] anointed he was
[1:25:43] commissioned amen amen and he says this
[1:25:46] man who's
[1:25:48] speaking he's not
[1:25:51] circumcised and he's not under the the
[1:25:53] the Abraham
[1:25:56] Covenant and he
[1:25:58] remembered that the Father the that
[1:26:01] Father
[1:26:02] Abraham was given a
[1:26:05] covenant that says you shall possess the
[1:26:08] gates of all your
[1:26:11] enemies he knew Abraham's blood was
[1:26:14] flowing in his
[1:26:18] veins so the Covenant that God had with
[1:26:21] Abraham
[1:26:24] he knew it applied to him
[1:26:26] too so that's why he said what's going
[1:26:28] to be done to the man who kills
[1:26:32] this he says I'll
[1:26:35] go they try to give him swords and
[1:26:40] Spears he says I'm not used to
[1:26:44] this I'm only used to speaking the
[1:26:48] word that's all I do amen amen and then
[1:26:53] he he saw
[1:26:57] goath gol says go go why are you
[1:27:01] insulting me sending me a little
[1:27:05] boy but he did not know that little boy
[1:27:07] was the end of
[1:27:10] him that little boy was
[1:27:14] anointed to kill
[1:27:16] Goliath it doesn't matter how small you
[1:27:19] are compared to your problem
[1:27:23] it doesn't matter how big your problem
[1:27:26] is go fight it you are anointed to
[1:27:31] overcoming because you are
[1:27:34] anointed you are anointed to be an
[1:27:37] overcomer so just go
[1:27:41] anyhow just go
[1:27:43] anyway you get that
[1:27:46] Victory you have an anointing on your
[1:27:49] life amen amen that's why he spoke the
[1:27:53] word and he says what you said you will
[1:27:55] do to me what you said you will do to
[1:27:59] me that's what I'm going to do to you he
[1:28:03] took his
[1:28:08] slingshot and the Bible says David ran
[1:28:11] towards
[1:28:14] Goliath he did not
[1:28:17] walk he

[1:28:45] that swingshot and let it
[1:28:50] go he didn't have to care care for a
[1:28:52] perfect
[1:28:55] aim because there was an anointing on
[1:28:57] his

[1:30:17] prophet he talks about when he was in

[1:39:05] Angel's
[1:39:08] hand and ate it
[1:39:10] up and it was in my mouth sweet as
[1:39:17] honey and as soon as I had eaten it
