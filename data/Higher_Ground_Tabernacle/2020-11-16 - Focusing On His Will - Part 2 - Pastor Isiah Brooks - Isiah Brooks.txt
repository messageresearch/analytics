appreciate every one of you who have come out to the lord to the house of the lord we'll try to finish up this morning's message we appreciate the holy spirit for being with us this morning we're still focusing on his will and god has allowed us to see what his will is uh for hundreds of years thousands of years if you want to say uh men has not known what the will of god uh was even for their own day and even when god tried to uh direct them by way of a prophet it seems like the people just didn't get get it but we realized today that we're at the end of it all the consummation of all things we're where time is no longer and uh god is no longer hiding himself he's revealing himself more so now to whosoever will if they desire to know truth god is obligated to bring that truth to them oftentimes when truth is brought to individuals they normally screen it through their theological t previous theological teachings and when they do that they miss god because god is not theology god is revelation as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to genesis the first chapter we're going to read there the 26th verse and then from that particular first verse excuse me that verse will we'll move to romans the 8th chapter genesis 1 26 which is uh familiar scripture and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and all over all every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth it's amazing when god says let us make man one man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion amen showing that in that one there was two amen so god is so good to us amen there was adam and adam and then after adam failed it was adam and eve amen according to genesis the fifth chapter amen romans 5 please excuse me romans 8. god is so good to us we dealt uh this morning uh a little bit with the mercy seat and showing how that god had to drive uh adam and eve out of the garden after they had fallen uh because if they had partake or partook of the tree of life they would have had uh everlasting life amen in that sinful state but blood of jesus christ had not been shed yet so god had to run them out amen um because to be honest with you uh blood that's there when there's no blood on the mercy seat there's judgment and so therefore god had to drive them out of of the garden but now that the blood is on the mercy seat um we are now being driven uh back into the holies of holies or to that place where christ has or is the mercy seat romans 8 we're going to read amen by god's gracious 26th verse of the eighth chapter we read down to the 30th verse likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know that what we should pray for as we ought excuse me for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that them who are called are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son and he might be the firstborn among men and brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he did call them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us let us pray father god we come before you once again we thank you for your holy grail we thank you god for being so good to us lord in a time like this in a time of struggling and a time oppressing in a time lord where it seems like the truth has been defeated but we know by your god by your grace this is the time that you normally show and prove yourself and father we thank you for this time in this day and lord i would not have wanted to live in no other time than this time i just believe by god by your grace lord you have made us for this hour and paul called us more than conquer us and that is what we are in christ jesus more than conquerors now we pray lord tonight that you bless the service bless the hearer that he will not only be a hearer but a doer of the word and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated and we know by god's uh by the scripture that god's will is perfect amen amen god will is perfect and we always want to walk in the perfect will of god amen he has what theologians call the permissive will but we understand that whenever you choose that route you always get in trouble so i think it's best that if we stand stay with the perfect will of god amen so that we will amen be glorified in him now as we said this morning amen that god intent and his uh purpose was to create a man in his own image and likeness and that is what he did now we know according to the scripture the first adam uh that god made is called the earthly adam right because he was of of the flesh part he was of that man the earth man but there was a second adam which we call jesus christ and the bible said not only was he uh from heaven but he was a a quickening spirit that means that he was one who could bring things to life and you and i understand and we know that there's only one life-giver and that is god himself so we understand by god's grace that when god came in the likeness of flesh amen he came down to redeem mankind and it could not have been a cousin or some strange distant fellow but it had to be one of blood kin it had to be a blood relative right so we understand by god's grace that we know that if it was a blood relative he who had to be the redeemer or kinsman redeemer amen he had to be a close king so we thank god for the grace of god because we know that jesus christ was the first fruit of his kind in in the way that we know jesus christ had his own body his body was made by god there was no flaws everything was perfect in itself but you and i we were born by the woman and because of that we have we we do experience death because you know there was a tree of life and there's a tree of death and so when the serpent and eve uh how can i say it when they united in the way that they did the woman traded places she became the tree of death and every man and woman born of a woman will surely die but the men those of us who are born of god will surely live so but there are times when we come to our place in life in this travel in this life sometimes there are times of perplexity you know sometimes their time of confusion sometimes there are times when you come to a place where you just really don't know what to do and which way to move understand by god's grace god has it all covered you and i must understand that nothing nothing nothing absolutely nothing happens in our lives by chance because the bible says that the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord is that right and even david said he's a lamp unto my pathway and a light unto my feet so we know by god's grace that god always leads us he's the great shepherd even in times when we don't understand he's leading us he's directing us and everything works just the way god wants them to work and but paul wanted to give us a scripture of consolation and that was in romans 8. he says likewise the spirit also heareth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make it intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he searches the heart knowing and knoweth what is the mind of god of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god now when you see that kind of a thing it makes you know that even when you have shut down in your own spirit god is still working on your behalf amen because he is the master builder he is the one that's working in around and through through all of us and even when we know the the essence or the the seriousness of prayer and when we even fall to there god is always there to work it out for us that doesn't mean we supposed to become lazy christians hallelujah but this is for those of us who trip and fall sometime amen or stumble that means god when when when when he sees you in a position where satan has gotten you in a position when you can't pray or whether you want to pray or whatever the case may be but from the inside have you ever have you ever prayed and your prayer is so deep you don't even know the words to say but you just say oh lord have mercy oh lord help me and in those few words the spirit knows exactly what you're talking about even when satan who is the listener has no idea of what you're saying he searches the heart knowing what is in the mind of the spirit that because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god and we know that that's what paul says we know and sometimes you know like i said we're not here oh lord why me but we know all of us know those of us who are truly christians we want to do the perfect will of god amen i always tell people if i didn't have this old nasty flesh hook to me i would be perfect [Laughter] because the inside man is perfect this is the only part that hinders me right here and this old joker amen uh uh if you're not careful will sway your will away from god's will hallelujah and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose understand this every man don't receive a call that's right but there are those who receive calls and those who answer calls and when you answer the call god will respond to you but those who have been predestinated those who have been chosen those who have been elected amen to the call god amen will bring you to the purpose for which he called you far see we don't know what he called us for but he'll call us and then reveal to us as we go along his purpose for calling us is that right you think you take the seven church age messenger they didn't know who they were that's right it was way down the road when god began to reveal to them and perhaps luther never understood who he was but this last angel messenger whom god used it was his ministry had gone for a long time before he came to understand that he was actually revelations uh had something to do with revelation 10 7. he he he came to know amen that he had a spirit of elijah on him by way of his wife because his second wife wanted to know lord you know show me a sign show me a sign right and god showed her the word of god according to malachi 4. now for whom he foreknew right and for knowing it means he knows us and and these are the kind of things we need to meditate on because it's very difficult for some for us sometimes to think that he really knew us before and if he did how how was it understand god's thoughts are perfect so whatever and however he saw you it was imperfection amen he didn't see your earing he saw perfection amen he always see you in perfection hallelujah for he all knew us he also did uh he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first bond among many brethren so even that predestination and i'm not going to take too long here but i wanted to say amen predestination is to it previous beings before right and destin he knew exactly how far he was going to take you right you can't go no there are boundaries right you know we might want to go farther further but we can't go no further than what god has predestinated us to be some singers some musicians some this some that you know i heard uh uh uh a brother rich who told me a long time ago and i thought there was a marvelous thing that he said he said think about how great god is god knew exactly how many musicians to make how many physicians to make how many teachers to make how many artists to make he said every gift and calling of god was predestined and none of us had anything to do with it he knew exactly how many singers wish they could sing and how many people who who who love piano playing or whatever wish they could do it and it's not there hallelujah because those gifts were designed for individuals to have and think about it we don't ever seem to run out of them so for every age god has always those gifts but understand in all of in every age there'll always be somebody that seemed to supersede all of the rest all of the rest and it's nothing they've done and nothing you know you know whether it be an opera singer whether it be a piano player whether you know they have more of an effect on their age or their generation than any other but it doesn't make them any better it's just that it's just the gift that god has decided to give to them and those gifts were given to magnify god with even though we satan or the world use those gifts amen to glorify the devil y'all understand me they say the devil gave me a gift the devil they never gave you a gift every good and perfect gift comes from the lord and every one of those people who are using their talents to glorify god the devil will be judged for that because it's not something the devil gave them even though they would use it for him you love the lord amen so we understand by god's grace to be predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that's what gets me yeah these trials and these tests that we're going through it's like we're going through a machinery something that's going to mold us and make us in to the you know to the image of god now realize that the clay the clay has no resistance if it's clay it moves at the master's hand hallelujah and that's the way god does with us we are the clay he's the potter we are the clay and many times when he putting the pressure on us to mold and to shape us those pressure points it's not a good thing you know you don't like it but remember we're being conformed we're being transformed we're being changed amen into the image and likeness of god see god's got a bride amen he has a bride and i don't care what the devil says the word keeps us just like the word predestinated us the word keeps us you are just as predestinated as jesus christ was amen amen mary you're going to have a son hallelujah mary mary wasn't the first one she was the first virgin being told that but isaiah saw it before mary knew it amen and no matter how many years it took for that that prophecy to come to pass it could not fall or it could not fail and when isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive god didn't have to go through a line of women trying to choose which one it would be god had already chose it was going to be married before the foundation of the world so is it with the bride of jesus christ god didn't have to go through a whole line of people to make a choice he knew your his choice his choice is perfect just like his will and you are the will of god made perfect manifested in this day that's how we are there's nothing the devil can do it he can't he can't stop this this will of god hallelujah he thought he could do it through death he thought if i could stop i could kill the people make them die i could keep them in prison hallelujah but once god pronounced life over you death has no hold hallelujah death can't even hold he couldn't hold jesus in the grave hallelujah is that all right you think about abraham and isaac and jacob hallelujah and all of them who have been in the ground for hundreds of years but when jesus rose they got up death lost his stain at calvary hallelujah and if we can continually to see that then no matter what satan comes excuse me no matter what satan brings before us we'll understand we are always in the will of god you understand me when you're under the blood you are always in the will of god why because satan can't come to you he can't come under the blood if he's under the blood he then becomes your brother hallelujah this is why it's so important in the presence amen once you stay in the presence of the lord hallelujah when satan comes amen to tempt you and and try you you must remind him satan i'm in the presence of the lord the lord is before me hallelujah amen when he tries to get you upset like the other day amen you must remind him i'm in the presence of the lord and the lord is before me in other words what you're trying to get me to do if i do it god is going to see it you understand me i can't do it i'm in the presence of the lord and the lord is before me that's how you keep that's how you keep him you keep saying about obey because that's the problem is eve and adam i don't know whether adam but they forgot who god was and even though uh uh god went through the garden adam adam we're out thou god knew where adam was god didn't have a lack of memory he knew exactly it's a strange thing is it that he walked in the direction that adam and he was he didn't care i can almost see him hiding behind the bush here's the bush and god says adam adam where are those lord here i am it wasn't like god didn't know what they were he wanted adam to understand where he was because now adam recognized through even the experience i'm in a place i've never been amen adam then knew from that point on he understood what it meant to be naked there was an experience that adam had never he always was clothed by the glory of god now he understands what naked is and then god says well who told you you were naked hallelujah and you say oh my goodness well it seemed like that was a mistake no sir no sir no sir god knew exactly what was going to happen this is why eve was the woman was made she was she was she was a weak of the vessels but god needed her a meant for his redemption plan hallelujah and god knew what adam was going to do that's why the lamb was slain before the foundation of the one that before earth started god had already in his mind knew what was going to take place and he knew it was going to be a lamb hallelujah you know god didn't go through the garden of eden said now which animal should die in adam and eve's dead he knew even the little lamb the first one that ever was slain god knew it was going to be that particular one you understand me so i'm trying to bring you to to understand that everything in your life as a christian everything whether it be good or evil uh however we judge it it still is in the will of god for example people say well jonah you know jonah was running from the presence of the lord jonah was in the will of god even though jonah did not know it he still was in the will of god god had already superseded him had already prepared a well for jonah's transportation amen sometimes we think we're out of the will of god and you're right there where god wants you to be elected of god being conformed into the image of god is that right oh you said well what about what about what abraham went down to egypt god said don't go down there don't go and that in his own will in his own will he went down to egypt anyway here is king abimelech right i think his name was that anyhow he sees he sees uh sarah and say oh what a beautiful lady right god knew and at the same time it looked like abraham was getting into trouble right because remember abraham's covenant was unconditional however whatever abraham did god had already put in an unconditional so god has could not curse him the only thing god could do with blessing so he goes down into egypt get into a king of immigrant territory he sees a biblical sees amen sarah as as a beautiful woman wants to marry her amen like any man would any king and now he's getting in trouble not abraham the king and god has to come to him and says hey hold up if you touch her you're going to die but lord you know i wouldn't yes i know you would not have done i know this you as a righteous man that's why i visited you visited you as in a dream so that you will know but let me tell you something just because i want you to know that you got to go to abraham [Music] ask abraham to forgive you you understand me as abraham for his forgiveness and have abraham to pray for you whoa lord have mercy but lord he was the one that lies you see what i'm saying when god justifies you who gonna lay any charge to you it doesn't give us the right to do wrong or to do evil but whenever we get in trouble god is on on the scene to bring us out of it and not only that god told abraham i won't bless you and going down to egypt god blessed him hey is that the truth hallelujah what was the king had to give abraham a i call it a tithing had to give him some of everything and now abraham is leaving out of egypt with more stuff than he had before he got there see that's the god i serve lord amen and you are what abraham see and brother branham said as god dealt with abraham god deals with abraham's seed in the same way amen amen who the devil don't like that one moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and what shall i say to these things if god before us who can be against us as long as god is for us no man no matter who he is they cannot prevail because when god is for us he becomes our battle axe he becomes our protector he he's our assurance that we shall prevail is that right we're winning in his presence amen hallelujah as i said this morning when we recognized that the sin that we first were born in has been totally uh uh done away with and then every time we make confessions to god see that's what the devil don't like he like for you you know to feel so bad to you can't confess and make right no sir i don't care whether it's small or whether it's great make right with god keep the blood of jesus christ over you amen because once the blood is on your side you're perfect you understand that as long as you're under the blood of jesus christ you're perfect and the reason why you're perfect is because he's perfect and brother branham said it like this god don't see your sins as long as you under the blood he only hears your voice but he sees the blood of jesus [Applause] oh my goodness see and you and i we understand by god's grace see if we could see how free we are the bible can't be wrong he whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is liv there's liberty so we're free we're free what from the bondage of sin and death literally free when christ is in you you're free from sin and death because the bible says as long as that seed is in you you cannot see him hallelujah am i crazy or something but the truth of the matter is we stand free whole before the lord we make mistakes that's what james said but the bible tells us also that if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and god do not run to the altar every time you make mistakes the bible said amen once and for all [Laughter] once and for all from the time you're saved to the time is finished once he saw it all even your tomorrow he saw it all hallelujah and he knows that in your heart because he knows that in your heart you'll make it right before you make it right hallelujah and understand the laws of sowing and reaping and this is one thing the believers must come to see not just in tithing and offering but in all of your life whatever you sow you shall reap all right in other words give him all oh i mentioned the other day when i was preaching on this samson you know gave god his strength god don't want your strength he wants your heart he wants you to love him love the lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding not your own will love him with all of your heart this is where i get a little frustrated with me because i want to love him with all my heart amen i hate it when my will gets in my way hallelujah hallelujah see you and i must understand when we give him all all of your i will that means we we have come to a place that we're totally dead and rotted and this is what god wants from us total death total death so much so to you rot because really in the law of sowing that's the only way we can live right two germ lives can come out of one seed the only seed of like the light that we want to come out of this is the life of christ right listen amen according to ii corinthians 9 6 through 80 says but this i say he would show it sparingly shall reap also sparingly and people say well you know god don't talk to me well how much do you talk to him you you put it in a little prayer you get a little answer right amen you've got to pray you got to give god all like our brother said pray without ceasing do you understand what that means if you pray without ceasing you you'll be fully overflowed with the response from god that's the communion that god wants that's what he wants but if he's fairly you know pray that's all you're gonna get right and he would showeth bountifully shall reap also bountifully amen every man accordingly has his purpose in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or necessity for god loveth the cheerful giver and you know that's what happened like i said even when it comes amen to the song service or when it comes to worship people grudgingly gives him you know i'm grudgingly you know oh don't let the pastor or the preacher or the song y'all raise your hand oh my goodness no they don't normally frown like that but you can almost feel it oh don't ask them to stand up will y'all stand up and give god the glory and then they don't give him the whole cup they give him a half a cup you know give him a half a cup you give him the whole cup but you see what people don't understand as you yo yeah every action even whether newton's law for every action is the opposite an equal reaction yes so when you see these things working and you think okay i'm going to give him that well that's all you're going to get see you see you you look at let's say it like this when you had blind bottom mayors who couldn't see didn't know where jesus was heard that was he he was in the crowd right he knew just screaming and cr screaming he ain't going to get his attention god don't care how loud your church is you can scream all you want to but when it comes from your heart that's a different story all those people were thrown in jesus but when blind by the man's cried he cried from his heart though son of david have mercy on me i can almost hear him and jesus turned you know what i mean it touched him do you understand his cry had to go to heaven and come back down because he was he you understand what i mean because he turned and says you know even when the woman with the issue of blood who touched me that kind of a thing oh my god we're talking about a serving of god and all god wants is this that little thing that beats in there is a place in there where god enthrones himself and god wants that space think about it god could have had a big hole in your heart right but it's a little pinhead right not that big come on we can't give him that that's all he wants just that little space in the heart to oper oh god it makes me ashamed of myself you know it makes me ashamed of myself with all that that he doesn't ask for half of your heart he doesn't ask for you know space just a little space that scientists finally found as a man thinketh in his heart so is he god help us help us help us whoo my listen and god is able to make all grace abound toward you amen you understand what i mean he's able to make uh what is grace unmerited favor he's able to make all grace abound towards you plenty of it plenty of it people we're saying that's all lord just give me a little more grace i don't want a little bit more i want the bountiful part hallelujah oh lord help me jesus that ye always have all sufficiency in things and may bound to every good word we're not that that quick in me i'm saying oh my god how we are living beneath our privilege huh yeah that ye always having all sufficiency y'all understand what i mean all your needs being met all sufficiency in all things naturally and spiritually may abound to every good work [Applause] that's the will of god you understand me so we have the press to what the will of god we want the will of god to be made manifest in our lives he said it can't happen yes it can solomon who never asked god for anything but in his heart he wanted to know how to rule god's people and god broke forth a in a dream a dream and saw and showed and talked to solomon and saw and asked solomon what would he have i could i give you whatever you want and solomon says lord all i want to do is know how to rule your people even as you would in other words i won't love them like you do i want to rule them however i just want that i want to do it just like you would do it it touched god amen solomon not only am i going to let this happen to you but i'm going to give you whatever you want and he did you love the lord i read that scripture this morning just give me a few more minutes i read that scripture this morning where in luke where jesus was praying and and that that always get me father if thou be willing remove this cup from me what was he saying in his humanity it was it was it was tough you know a lot of us don't understand he felt it all right brother branham said he went to calvary alone he went there as a man he felt the smacks in his face he felt the spitting he felt the rejection and every one of us know what rejection feels like that's a horrible feeling ain't nothing like it but to know that i came into my own and my own received me not that's really hurtful and yet he felt all those things and under all that pressure and he never broke he never broke people he kept his eyes the bible said he set his face like a flint why it was revealed to him his purpose and his calling and he understood this is something that i i must do i must do i am the savior i am that lamb isaiah spoke of is that right he found his identity in the word and he stayed with it because it was his revelation hallelujah he stayed with it understanding the pain and sorrows that he had to go through come on think about it you and i we're going to go through something we must understand the pain and the sorrows that we're going to go through and yet lord not my will but let thine they die every christian it gotta suffer you're gonna go through something jesus said if they did it in the green they're gonna do it in the dry you understand me there is no way a christian you're gonna be a christian and not suffer one way or another it it must happen because that's that brings on growth persecution brings on growth to be rejected brings on growth it brings you to a place where you really know you come to know who you really are hallelujah i'm so glad and i know this sounds really wicked to somebody who may be carnal but one thing let's say it like this so it won't be offensive this coronavirus this covert 19 has made me come to know more so on who i am i've seen god in this period greater now than ever before hallelujah and i know amen with all those who are he i could have said running and and and uh uh oh there's a word i want to use but anyway they they're leaving the message at a time like this but you see this is the beginning of what i call the beginning of the beginning because it's a beginning of a new world order and it's the beginning for the bride and her eternal affairs in life with christ time will be no more the revelation of god is finished is that right amen the jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new the only thing is just a changing of a mask amen changing of mass we didn't understand it but god hid it all along he hid it in the lamb that was jesus he hid it in the in the red heifer that was jesus hallelujah he hid it in the dove that was symbolic of jesus all those symbols were symbolic of one god and in the way he would perform and do uh with the people throughout the ages we must yield to the will of god and god is going to bring us to the test this is what we don't understand i think i don't say it like that we don't but let me say it like this all the squeeze is going to come yes but what is it it is to press you it's to push you into a place where you must yield one way or the other right it it with the holy ghost you'll yield like peter crucified me upside down i'm not worthy to be crucified like my lord and on the other hand you can still act like peter before the conversion i don't know him cursed him to is that right cursed him three times before the crew i don't know him that's the unconverted man and that man peter unconverted and peter converted is going to be squeezed hallelujah yes sir but then when that squeeze comes you know wow hallelujah like i said i know my redeemer liveth that's what joe said squeezed out to nothing amen all it was was a big flesh with boils and everything else on it talk about rejection talking about nobody standing alone wife doesn't separate it from you pretty much children gone you all by yourself you and jesus but one thing about joel he knew no matter what i go through the covenant still stands that's all i'm saying no matter what you go through the covenants still stand and guess what job didn't know he was in the will of god what even in his suffering he was in the will of god in jesus suffering he was in the will of god in samson's suffering he was in the will of god people think because i suffer i'm not in the will of god no sir many times god bring you through the suffering those hebrew boys they were in the suffering daniel was in the suffering in the will of god in the will of god you mean to tell me god yes he will a lot of time we want the shortcut god don't never take your shortcuts he takes you through the longer way right seven days they could have been in in the promised land and he took him 40 years and the scripture says i think according to chronicles that god took him took them through there to so that they could know what was in their hearts that's either chronicles of deuteronomy i can't remember but the whole point is you and i know that this test these things that we're going through now what what happens what what is it revealing to you what's in your heart amen what's in your heart i thank god for it right think about paul who had been oh my goodness paul was applauding those folks yeah kill him kill him kill him hit him with another stone kill him right cheerleader for them stoning stephen i'll hold your coat get him you know that kind of a thing but you got to realize paul was still in the will of god hallelujah is that right brother branham said god used that as a driving force amen for paul because paul felt so guilty for being an uh uh there and as as stephen's adversary you know he was feeling so guilty that he was one who actually helped this thing happen he never got over it and that was the thing god would use to keep pushing paul you know making him feel like so unworthy oh how many times he was found you know stoned dead or three times i think it wasn't reservation you didn't tell me i gotta die again you gotta die again but you see it it just what he had to go through and and listen paul god didn't just leave it there paul had a thorn in his flesh too to keep him humble with the mighty revelation that he had of god god had to keep him humble hallelujah y'all understand what i'm saying a lot of times the more revelation you have the understanding of god that you have the more suffering you go through only to keep this boy this flesh in his proper place but no without a shout of god doubt amen you're in the will of god amen amen you're in the will of god you've been called out and called into and god has never lost one and he never will but both of them knew the will of god and when it came to paul when paul knew that he had to go down to nero's chopping block paul didn't say oh whoa it's me paul had done went through so much perhaps amen nero shock and block looked like a delight to him you understand me he had been stoned and beaten and shipwrecked and you name it paul they've gone through it can you imagine knowing that i'm getting ready to get my final exam my final test let me go remember they tried to keep paul from going to see nero but paul made every he pushed his way there because god told him you got to go before him and then i could see paul now laughing laughing at death oh death where's your staying o great where's your victory thanks be to god who giveth me giveth us victory through our lord and savior jesus christ it was given to him paul knew that paul understood he was worthy of death you know the law you know listen let me move on what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose today choose life or death your choice will determine your eternal destiny and what you choose remember jesus said follow me and you and and you're invited tonight to do so and to follow him is to is to is to eternal life you must come to his terms that's right the word not upon the creed not upon the public not upon opinion not upon what anybody else thinks about it but on what god says about it and this is why people don't want to die to their will my mama was a baptist my daddy was a presbyterian my grandma was a lutheran whatever the case may be whatever worked for them then will not work for you now why because the will of god has changed and he's moving on up amen preparing his self of people for a translation you cannot make the translation looking like the world acting like the world thinking like the world the only those of us who make the rapture will be those who will allow the mind of christ let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus that's right that's where we are right proverbs 3 5-7 trust in the lord with all thine heart lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil let me say it like this people none of us is worthy to enter behind the holies of holies none of us in ourselves could ever enter there it takes god it takes the holy spirit to prepare you and to rob you you understand me you have to be robed you must be in him and he must be in you robed to go behind that veil and to stay behind that veil because that's where god wants us to stay behind that veil when you stay behind that veil guess what it's communion with you and god alone that's when people really think you're crazy he's a strange fellow [Music] all he do is talk about jesus watch him here he comes again man i'm coming again that's right all i can tell you is i got jesus on my mind that's it take it or leave it whatever you want to do think about it but god wants our report to be a positive report not a negative no matter what we go through we must keep the report positive y'all understand me ten spies came back from canaan saying with an evil report report what god showed them told them what the will of god was i want you to go over there i want you the priest already preached to him go over there i want you to conquer everything wherever your feet wherever they land it's yours i've given you the land you got to fight for it but i've given it to you as long as you stay within my will as long as you stay within my word i fight every battle for you so is it today amen as long as you stay in the will as long as you stand the word god will fight every one of your battles it was only when it can broke the word and and men i think 300 men died in that instant dance hallelujah amen but once that was restored amen that was fixed amen the protection of god continued hallelujah but those spies came back they said we can't do it now we look at this and we say well how could they do that don't you realize that most of canaan was full of giants almost every one of those tribes were giants are related to them every time i know sharp they talk about giants and that's what those uh jews went in there and they saw those great big giants i'm not talking about seven footers i'm talking about taller than that and back in the day the normal man was short anyhow jesus was short but you look and you know if it wasn't so saul was one of the tallest of them all and god pointed him out right because most of the tall men in that day were giants so when when they went in there the the anakins and the and the canaanites and all those people out there they were big guys and you know what they weren't only big they had uh war material chariots made out of iron and you know that's kind of what it was and and in the natural eye how in the world can we do this we're coming out of egypt and we don't even have a chariot [Laughter] hallelujah but you see that ain't the way god fight not by power not by might but by my spirit said the lord god don't fight with your strength god fight with his strength he uses you is that right come on you think samson wouldn't have been able to kill what 600 philistines with the jawbone of an ass you think that was samson's strength that was god's strength it's always god's strength is that right you must bring back a positive report never i don't care y'all help me you hear me say something negative correct me please help me because this is not a time to be negative it's positive everything with god is yes i don't care what we're going through financially physically whatever it's still god is good yes sir right the ministry of joshua was to be magnified before the people according to joshua 3 7. is that right and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of the of all your israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i'll be with thee this will say it to the people so you got to understand also amen this was a great day and then for the people to know that god was with them but instead we come back with a a bad report let me tell you something it does that we talk about the world council churches we talk about all of these things that are taking place these are the giants in the land hallelujah but we already know david was a giant slayer amen and understand my god is still a giant slayer i believe in the supernatural right caleb steal the people say hey what are you talking about have you so forgotten how god has brought you already where is your testimony remember you were in egypt your mom and your dad and everybody was in egypt hallelujah i'm sure they told you of the story shall we cow down now we're more than able yes sir the lord brought us out of egypt the lord brought us through the wilderness god fed us god clothed us and you mean to tell me that you're going to fret at these giants he's still god you understand he's still god and god wants us to be in his will as powerful soldiers is that right put on the whole arm of god and that's what god is trying to tell us you didn't come for a picnic you came to fight amen i'm almost done you know the bible says in john 16 says in that day you should ask me nothing very very i say unto you whatsoever you ask in the father the father in my name he will give it to you how many all believe that hallelujah that's the word hear the two have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that what your joy may be for he gonna give it to you to do what to make sure your joy is full [Laughter] knowing that jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ is the new amen so there's the power in the name of jesus hallelujah oh i'm almost done let me hurry hear me hurry amen like i said philippians says let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus you've never seen jesus christ run from a battle amen you've never seen him fight hallelujah have you his battling was by god alone there were times he walked through through the crowds because there were times they wanted to make him king and it was not yet time for him to be crowned and he did things because he knew the word was not that was not time it wasn't time for that to take place but never did jesus say i'm scared i'm afraid even in the garden of gethsemane he said father i wouldn't this cup passed from me but he not one negative word came out of his mouth he never said lord i just don't think i can do it no he never said it he kept his words he kept he watched the gate of his mouth he made sure that every word came out that it lined up with the bible with his prophecy he said nothing contrary he kept this thing right in line with god hallelujah you know why i'm saying these things eh because if the divine nature is going to be in you these are the kinds of qualities that made it these faith virtues knowledge knowledge to know what he did how he did it the temperance the patience it took jesus to magnify all of those things throughout his life throughout his life and this is what made us know that he was crowned with divine love because on the day of his crucifixion he said father forgive them for they know not what they do who could forgive like that you're still hurting with pain beating blood is everywhere and you ask him for their forgiveness what a mighty man he was what a mighty lamb i call him the mighty lamb what about the lamb hallelujah hallelujah listen i know i've gone a little longer than i wanted to he said unless anything dies and rot life can't come from it unless a man dying rod in his own thoughts christ can't get into his heart when you're trying to think for yourself now if i walk up to the altar and say yes lord i'm a fine fella i'll take you i'll pay my tithe i'll do this he said you got to die and rot right there to your thoughts let the holy ghost takes over and just do whatever he wants to do with you get kind of messy with it that sounds horrible not sacrilegious but it's the truth it's the only way i know how to punch the thing out to make you understand it what was more of a mess than the dignified bunch of jews that day than to see these people coming out there with stammering lips you know what a stammering lip is he said other tongues and acting like drunk people and then he says that's exactly what they were doing they looked messy and he said are these men all full of new wine but after one of a kind of got up to himself and he says let this be known unto you and hearken to my words these are not drunk like you suppose it is but he went back to the scripture this is that that was spoken by of the prophet joel and it comes and it shall come to pass in the last days said the lord i'll pour out my spirit upon all fact this is what gets me if god is still pouring out of his spirit what kind of action should we have oh hallelujah what happened there these people were out of themselves there was nothing they were doing according to their own will they wouldn't have never acted like that but they allowed themselves to die and rot rotten the holy ghost was able to come in them you know that was so powerful to me you can't make a con covenant with god when god wants you to do something lord if you save me i'll do this and i'll do that he said that's your own thought you got to die to all of that you got to die to all that you can't you can't uh proposition god with anything come as you are you got to empty out so much so you're nothing i don't even deserve to be here but have mercy on me lord right you can't give god something that he gave you hallelujah i surrender all that's all you can do that's the way the church had was born first how many believe that god is infinite then he cannot change whoo that's right and if that was his idea of a church that at the beginning that's the kind of church he's have at the end he cannot change so how are you going to substitute shaking hands or sprinkling or some other little thing like that didn't happen right there each one of those apostles went right back to that after they they done all these holy ghosts and fear fell on them peter said can we forbid seeing that these are has received the holy ghost like we did at the same beginning and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's right this thing is unexplainable now i'm stopping here but this thing is unexplainable you can't you can't fully explain it because god is revelation if you're gonna know him you're gonna know him by revelation hallelujah and that's the way it is today if you're going to know god i don't care how much word you read it's always good to read people yes sir it's always good to read you should never get tired of reading this satan will make you he try to get you but understand you want to read with the anointing you want the teacher of the teacher you want the writer of the writer to be in your company to be in your there to unfold like you said even when you when you go to scriptures and how god can you know once you understand the outfit of the maker he can begin to open your understanding with the message because understanding the message is the revelation of this but you still need to be in the spirit john was in the spirit on the lord's day you must be in the spirit to understand the message you cannot be a carnal mind and think you understand the message amen it's a spiritual thing spiritually given right when we as an organization denomination we did we compared scripture to scripture all that was good but people of god is more than that you've got to have the revelation of the word by the holy spirit he is the teacher and the bible said he will lead you and guide you into all truth you love the lord let's stand just to be in his will we want god's perfect will amen hallelujah i love you lord and i leave my voice to worship you oh my soul rejoice take joy my key in what you eat maybe a sweet sweet house in your and i live my voice to worship you oh my soul read joy take joy my king oh in what you here may it be a sweet sweet sound in your grief oh i love you lord and i lift my voice to worship you oh my soul rejoice take joy my king [Music] in what you hear maybe a sweet sweet [Music] to
