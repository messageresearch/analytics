[43:01] When he comes, your situation will never
[43:05] remain the same. Oh Jesus.
[43:09] [Music]
[43:12] Oh
[43:13] [Music]
[43:14] Jesus.
[43:18] Yes.
[43:22] All things
[43:25] are possible.
[43:29] Oh, let's sing it one more time. Sing,
[43:33] Lord, I believe. Oh
[43:37] Lord.
[43:41] Say each and every word. I'll say yes
[43:44] and amen.
[43:46] Lord, I be aware
[43:52] that all things
[43:56] are possible.
[43:59] Yes, Lord.
[44:03] He will turn your impossibilities
[44:06] to possibility if you believe him.
[44:10] Sing, Lord, I believe.
[44:14] Oh
[44:16] Lord,
[44:18] I believe
[44:23] all things
[44:26] are possible.
[44:32] But one more time, let us just sing.
[44:34] Jesus is here. He is in our midst this
[44:37] morning.
[44:39] Jesus,
[44:40] [Music]
[44:42] just reach out and touch the hem of his
[44:44] garments.
[44:47] Say, Lord, do not pass me by.
[44:51] I know
[44:54] things.
[44:57] Thank you, Lord.
[45:02] Jesus is here.
[45:08] Jesus
[45:11] is here.
[45:14] All Jesus
[45:19] is here.
[45:23] All things
[45:26] are possible.
[45:30] Jesus
[45:33] is here.
[45:38] Amen. How many believe that he's in our
[45:41] midst this morning? Let us just sing
[45:44] this song as we're getting ready to get
[45:45] into the word. The steadfast love of the
[45:48] Lord, it never ever ceases. Amen.
[45:53] Steadfast
[45:55] love
[45:56] of the Lord
[45:59] never cease.
[46:04] His merc
[46:07] is never
[46:10] come
[46:12] to an end.
[46:16] For they are new
[46:19] every morning.
[46:23] New every morning
[46:29] great is thy faithfulness.
[46:34] Oh Lord,
[46:37] [Music]
[46:39] great is thy faith.
[46:44] Sing the steadfast love
[46:51] of the Lord
[46:54] never cease
[46:57] us
[47:03] [Music]
[47:05] come
[47:06] to an end
[47:10] for they are known
[47:13] Every morning
[47:15] so no every morning
[47:22] great is thy faith
[47:25] on this oh Lord.
[47:29] [Music]
[47:32] Oh, sing
[47:35] for they are new.
[47:38] They are known
[47:41] every morning.
[47:43] So new every morning
[47:49] with is thy faithfulness.
[47:55] Oh Lord,
[47:59] where is thy faith?
[48:02] One more time. Say they are new.
[48:07] [Music]
[48:09] Every morning
[48:12] know.
[48:14] Oh my Lord.
[48:18] [Music]
[48:22] Oh Lord
[48:26] is thy face.
[48:31] Oh Lord,
[48:35] it is thy faithfulness.
[48:38] [Music]
[48:44] Amen.
[48:48] We thank God for his presence this
[48:50] morning. Amen.
[48:52] How many believe that his mercies are
[48:54] new each and every morning?
[48:57] Every morning you open your eyes to wake
[48:59] up, you see new mercies. He never gives
[49:02] you the mercies of yesterday.
[49:05] He gives you mercies for each and every
[49:07] day. Hallelujah.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; If you only believe and receive what his
[49:12] word says towards you, he will never
[49:15] ever fail you.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Let us just bow our heads and pray.
[49:22] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; our hearts are mellowed this morning,
[49:29] knowing, oh father god, that your
[49:31] steadfast love never ever fails.
[49:33] [Music]
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, who else could we go to but to
[49:38] you, oh God,
[49:40] [Music]
[49:42] &gt;&gt; the author and the finisher of our
[49:43] faith.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the bishop of our souls.
[49:50] We know we can never ever be lost
[49:55] &gt;&gt; because you are the great shepherd who
[49:57] takes care of us.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we are in your
[50:01] presence, oh God,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; not so we could hear from a man,
[50:08] but we want to hear you speak to us, oh
[50:09] God.
[50:12] Lord, we have come with different
[50:13] questions.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; We have come with different needs, oh
[50:18] God.
[50:19] But we know it's not our friend, it's
[50:21] not our brother who can supply those
[50:23] needs.
[50:26] But it is only you who can do that
[50:29] because you say in your word
[50:32] that you will supply all our needs
[50:36] according to your riches and glory.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; And we know those riches are unending.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, look at each and every raised hand
[50:45] in this place.
[50:48] You see the need behind be near each
[50:50] child.
[50:53] I pray you stretch forth your hand.
[50:57] Touch your children. Oh God.
[51:00] Provide for your children. Oh God.
[51:03] Deliver someone who needs deliverance.
[51:07] Lord as we are reading and speaking your
[51:09] word.
[51:12] I pray that your Holy Ghost might come
[51:13] and give action
[51:16] to the ministration of your word.
[51:21] We know we are not feeding off of a man
[51:24] [Music]
[51:26] feeding on the unfailing body word
[51:31] Jesus Christ.
[51:33] Say wherever the carcass is,
[51:35] that's where the eagles are gathered.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Look at the gathering of the eagles this
[51:40] morning.
[51:42] We could look we're looking up to you
[51:46] &gt;&gt; for our providence
[51:49] Jesus Christ mighty uncontested name
[51:53] we pray believing amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be in the house of God
[52:01] Sunday morning. Amen. Just turn around
[52:03] and shake your neighbor's hand.
[52:09] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[52:11] Lord?
[52:22] Amen. Let us remember the pastor in
[52:24] prayer.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; He has uh traveled to Iowa City.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Iowa City. There is there is a wedding
[52:35] over there that he is um officiating
[52:41] &gt;&gt; and um he told us to recognize that on
[52:48] next weekend.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; We have a wedding for sister Naomi and
[52:54] brother Nathan.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; So let us keep them in prayer
[53:03] &gt;&gt; so that Everything goes according to
[53:04] plan.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Whilst we're standing, let us open our
[53:10] Bibles.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah chapter one.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. If one of the brothers could get
[53:20] me a clicker from the office, I left it
[53:22] on the desk. A clicker.
[53:34] In the book of Jeremiah chapter one
[53:38] verse 4,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; the Bible reads,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; "Then the word of the Lord came unto me,
[53:46] saying,
[53:50] Before I formed thee in the belly, I
[53:52] knew thee,
[53:57] and before thou camest forth out of the
[54:00] womb,
[54:03] I sanctify thee
[54:06] and I ordain thee a prophet unto the
[54:09] nations.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Also standing if you can go to the book
[54:14] of Ephesians
[54:19] chapter one and verse 4.
[54:26] The Bible reads,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; "According as he hath chosen us in him
[54:32] before the foundation of the world, that
[54:35] we should be holy and without blame
[54:37] before him in love,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; having predestinated us unto the
[54:48] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[54:51] himself,
[54:58] according to the good pleasure of his
[55:00] will.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add blessings to the
[55:04] reading of his word.
[55:08] We can take our seats.
[55:10] Amen. Amen. In the Bible verse that we
[55:13] read in Jeremiah,
[55:16] we see the Lord appeared to Jeremiah
[55:20] and he said, "Before I formed thee in
[55:22] the belly of your mother,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; I knew thee
[55:28] &gt;&gt; and I ordained thee unto a prophet
[55:32] &gt;&gt; to be a prophet unto the nations."
[55:36] So we see God is telling Jeremiah,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; before you were born,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I had you on my mind
[55:46] before the foundation of the world,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; I knew thee.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; So that gives us an assurance
[55:57] to know that we don't serve a God who
[55:58] does things have happened,
[56:03] &gt;&gt; but he has already predestinated you.
[56:05] Before
[56:08] you were born,
[56:10] he already knew you.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; He already had set a purpose in your
[56:14] life
[56:17] before you were born.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:22] And in Ephesians when we are reading
[56:27] it says according as he hath chosen
[56:33] us in him before the foundation of the
[56:35] world
[56:38] that we should be holy
[56:41] and without blame before him in love.
[56:45] He predestinated yougest
[56:48] &gt;&gt; to be children of Jesus Christ.
[56:53] not for any other purpose.
[56:56] But for his will
[57:00] by reading the scriptures,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; we get an understanding
[57:05] that we have a representation
[57:09] that is in eternity.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this morning for a little
[57:15] while I want to speak on this subject.
[57:20] Looking in the mirror of the word,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; looking in the mirror of the word.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And for a subtitle,
[57:32] &gt;&gt; it is amnesia dispersed.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Dispelled. Amnesia dispelled.
[57:46] Yeah, the correct word is dispelled.
[57:47] Amnesia dispelled.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; So, we are looking at how God had us
[57:54] before the foundation of the world
[57:59] and we know we have a representation in
[58:01] heaven.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can know
[58:07] what you look like before the foundation
[58:09] of the world
[58:13] If you look into the word
[58:16] because before the beginning
[58:19] was the word
[58:21] after the beginning is still the word
[58:24] and the word of God never ever changes.
[58:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Bible says
[58:30] heaven and earth shall pass away.
[58:34] But he says my word shall never pass
[58:36] away.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you know when
[58:40] you stand on God's word
[58:44] that is the only thing that is sure.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't what it doesn't matter what
[58:49] people say.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; People change their minds daily.
[58:55] But God's word never changes.
[58:58] It's the same yesterday, today, and
[59:01] amen. Amen. When I was growing up going
[59:03] to school,
[59:05] we all know they told us your existence
[59:07] started when you got out of your mother.
[59:12] When you gave your first breath,
[59:16] that's when they say that's when you
[59:17] started existing.
[59:20] But we know that's not true.
[59:23] We thank God for the message of Malachi
[59:27] that came to open our eyes
[59:30] that told us that before there was the
[59:32] foundation of the world
[59:35] before there was an atom on this earth
[59:40] you were there.
[59:42] So we get to see in the word
[59:46] existence did not start on this earth
[59:50] that our existence started in eternity.
[59:52] Before
[59:55] God said, "Let there be light."
[59:59] You were there. Before God said, "Let
[1:00:02] every seed bring after
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:15] You were there before he created the
[1:00:18] sun, the Jupiter and Mars.
[1:00:22] You was already there.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; When he created the angels,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; you were already there.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; When he created Satan,
[1:00:35] you were there.
[1:00:37] So you have more seniority than Satan
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; because Satan had a beginning
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; and he for sure has an end.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; But you don't have a beginning
[1:00:52] and you do not have an end. Hallelujah.
[1:00:55] Hallelujah. So you should not accept
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; to live under your privileges
[1:01:04] downtrodden
[1:01:06] by a being that has a beginning and the
[1:01:09] end
[1:01:13] because you are like God.
[1:01:16] We come from God and we go back.
[1:01:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You remember
[1:01:21] when God was asking Job,
[1:01:25] he said, "Where were you, Job?"
[1:01:28] When the sons of God shouted for joy,
[1:01:33] I'm a witness this morning.
[1:01:36] I can say, "I was there
[1:01:38] shouting for joy
[1:01:41] before God created the foundations of
[1:01:43] the earth."
[1:01:46] How were we there?
[1:01:49] Because we were an attribute of God.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; You were in his thoughts.
[1:01:56] It might be hard to understand.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; But look at you. You were in your great
[1:02:01] great grandfather.
[1:02:07] You did not know it.
[1:02:09] But you were in his loins.
[1:02:12] You just had to wait for a specific time
[1:02:17] that God had predestinated
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; for you to be made manifest.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; So wherever your grandfather went,
[1:02:29] you went with him.
[1:02:31] Whatever things he did,
[1:02:35] you did it with him.
[1:02:37] That's why they says there are diseases
[1:02:39] that runs down in the Jesus.
[1:02:45] in your DNA.
[1:02:50] A disease that runs in your DNA
[1:02:55] is coming from your grandfather.
[1:02:58] It is being passed down.
[1:03:02] But I'm glad to know that I come from my
[1:03:05] heavenly father
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; and his DNA is in my body.
[1:03:12] Amen. Whatever he was,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; whatever he is,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I can say I am.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; So we thank God,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; we can see in the scriptures
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; that we had an existence
[1:03:28] before we came on this earth.
[1:03:31] But when we are leaving,
[1:03:35] you have to look in the mirror of the
[1:03:36] word
[1:03:38] so you can get to know
[1:03:41] what your true representation looks
[1:03:43] like.
[1:03:48] Our little peanut brain cannot
[1:03:50] comprehend
[1:03:53] because when you were born, you came
[1:03:54] with amnesia.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; You forgot your origin.
[1:04:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But the message
[1:04:02] of the hour came to open your eyes to
[1:04:06] let you know that you might have
[1:04:07] forgotten
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; and he came to remind us
[1:04:14] that we come from God
[1:04:16] and after we are done conquering on this
[1:04:18] earthqu.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; So we're speaking on looking in the
[1:04:26] mirror of the world.
[1:04:30] amnesia dispelled.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the book of Timothy,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; it says, "Who hath saved us?"
[1:04:39] God who has saved us and called us with
[1:04:42] a holy calling,
[1:04:46] not according to our works,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; but according to his own purpose
[1:04:53] and grace,
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:04:58] before the world began.
[1:05:03] He called you to his own purpose before
[1:05:06] the world even began.
[1:05:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And Titus tells us that in hope of
[1:05:15] eternal life,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; which God that cannot lie,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; promised before the world began.
[1:05:28] Hallelujah. So you have eternal life.
[1:05:32] It does not start when you were saved,
[1:05:36] but it started before the foundation of
[1:05:37] the world.
[1:05:40] Because eternal means no beginning, no
[1:05:42] end.
[1:05:45] So if you start getting eternal life
[1:05:47] when you are saved,
[1:05:52] it means it has a starting point.
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:57] It already began before the foundation
[1:05:59] of the world.
[1:06:02] Your salvation just brought you to that
[1:06:04] realization
[1:06:07] that I am a son of God.
[1:06:10] I am a daughter of God.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said in the church
[1:06:16] ages,
[1:06:18] it says, "Now it says that he has chosen
[1:06:21] us in him.
[1:06:27] Jesus before the foundation of the
[1:06:28] world.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; That means we were right there with him
[1:06:33] in the mind.
[1:06:37] Thoughts of God before the foundation of
[1:06:39] the world.
[1:06:42] That gives an eternal quality to the
[1:06:44] elect.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Look at that. You cannot get
[1:06:50] away from that.
[1:06:54] You cannot get away from the eternal
[1:06:56] quality
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:00] that God plays in you.
[1:07:03] Why? Because you were right there with
[1:07:05] him.
[1:07:07] And even still right now, you are still
[1:07:10] right there with him.
[1:07:12] So you cannot get away from it.
[1:07:16] Hallelujah.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many are glad to know
[1:07:20] that you have a representation in
[1:07:21] heaven?
[1:07:24] The brother of God calls them
[1:07:25] theophanes.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; You and me, we have theophony.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; When you heard the message of the hour,
[1:07:34] he says you heard from your theophony.
[1:07:39] There is that invisible connection
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; that you cannot see
[1:07:46] but you are hearing from the heavenlies.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; In um the rapture
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God says
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; now so were you
[1:08:00] were you in if you've got eternal life
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; you were in God before there ever was a
[1:08:07] world.
[1:08:11] Hallelujah.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; You are a part,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; a son of God,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; an attribute of God,
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; an attribute.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; He know the very age you were coming.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You did not just appear haphazardly.
[1:08:32] People might call you a mistake, but you
[1:08:33] are not a mistake.
[1:08:37] God predestinated you.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He was intentional in making you come to
[1:08:42] pass.
[1:08:46] You knew what he was doing.
[1:08:49] He predestinated you to that age.
[1:08:54] You take that place
[1:08:56] and no one else can take it.
[1:09:01] It doesn't matter how many
[1:09:02] impersonations and things.
[1:09:06] You've got to be there,
[1:09:08] brother, sister. No one can take your
[1:09:10] place
[1:09:13] because your place is yours.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is not
[1:09:18] enough gossip
[1:09:21] that can take you out of your place
[1:09:24] because God's predestination stands.
[1:09:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You remember
[1:09:31] David in the Bible.
[1:09:33] He was supposed to be anointed to be
[1:09:35] king.
[1:09:37] And they had the seven brothers coming.
[1:09:41] They tried to pour the oil, but the oil
[1:09:42] was not there.
[1:09:46] The oil was not meant for Eliah.
[1:09:52] It was not meant for Elisha,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; but it was meant for David
[1:09:59] because he was predestinated
[1:10:02] for that particular age
[1:10:05] and no one else could take it.
[1:10:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that
[1:10:10] anointing was only meant for David.
[1:10:15] So what is meant for you, it is meant
[1:10:17] for you.
[1:10:22] There is no man that can take you out of
[1:10:23] your position
[1:10:26] because God has predestinated you.
[1:10:30] And he says you've got to be there
[1:10:34] because he knew you would be there.
[1:10:37] Now you are made manifest
[1:10:40] so you can fellowship with him.
[1:10:44] If you don't know what your purpose is,
[1:10:47] go to God in prayer and you say, "Lord,
[1:10:51] may you please make manifest
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; what you predestinated me to be
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; because Daniel
[1:11:00] wanted to sit where you are seated right
[1:11:02] now."
[1:11:05] Daniel wanted to live in Leodia.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He saw you hearing the message of the
[1:11:13] hour.
[1:11:15] And he says, "Lord,
[1:11:18] please may you make me come in that
[1:11:19] age."
[1:11:22] And he says, "No, go thy way, Daniel."
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Why did he refuse? He reject Daniel to
[1:11:28] come in Leodysia.
[1:11:32] Because it was for you.
[1:11:34] Leodio was predestinated for you.
[1:11:38] And Daniel could not take it.
[1:11:41] So there is no one else who can take
[1:11:43] that place from you.
[1:11:45] Your prayer should should be Lord
[1:11:51] please make manifest manifest
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; what you have predestinated for me
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; because I know there is no impersonation
[1:12:03] that can take your predestination away
[1:12:05] from me.
[1:12:07] There is not enough sin
[1:12:11] that can take you out of the
[1:12:12] predestination of God.
[1:12:15] There is not enough demons in hell
[1:12:19] that can take you out of the
[1:12:20] predestination of God.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? You can never ever fail
[1:12:28] because you are the word of God.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:34] When Jesus came,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the word
[1:12:39] made flesh
[1:12:41] and he dwelt among us.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He stepped from his theophony
[1:12:48] and he came into this terrestrial body.
[1:12:53] But we know we
[1:12:55] came from the thoughts of God from being
[1:12:57] an attribute.
[1:13:01] We bypassed our theophony
[1:13:06] which is the word body.
[1:13:08] So we bypassed our word body
[1:13:13] and we came into this flesh.
[1:13:17] Amen. Amen. But we know we are not
[1:13:21] supposed to remain flesh
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; because we have a word bridegroom.
[1:13:32] who's supposed to be married to the word
[1:13:35] bride.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you, the
[1:13:41] bride, which is flesh,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; has to be transformed
[1:13:48] to become the word,
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; which is what God had in his mind for
[1:13:53] you
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Christ,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word.
[1:14:09] You are supposed to become the word.
[1:14:14] The prophet of God says the
[1:14:17] body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:20] which is the bride
[1:14:22] will be part of his body
[1:14:27] which he was the word
[1:14:30] and the bride will have to be the word.
[1:14:36] Word added to word
[1:14:40] add to word.
[1:14:42] Hallelujah. And we know the word never
[1:14:45] ever fails.
[1:14:47] So if the word never ever fails,
[1:14:51] you the bride are supposed to come in to
[1:14:53] be the word.
[1:14:56] It means you can never ever fail
[1:15:00] because you are becoming the word.
[1:15:03] what God had for you before the
[1:15:05] foundation of the world.
[1:15:10] Before God had seen you
[1:15:13] when he said before you were born,
[1:15:17] I knew thee.
[1:15:19] What was he talking about? He was
[1:15:22] talking about the bride word.
[1:15:26] That's what you were supposed to become.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; So when you look into the mirror of the
[1:15:31] word,
[1:15:33] You are seeing the picture that you are
[1:15:35] supposed to transform.
[1:15:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In Isaiah
[1:15:45] it says, "So shall my word,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; be that goeth forth out of my mouth,
[1:15:54] it shall not return unto me void,
[1:15:59] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:16:01] please,
[1:16:04] and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:16:06] whereto I sent it.
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:13] You are the bride that is supposed to
[1:16:15] become the word.
[1:16:18] So where it says the word,
[1:16:21] you can put your name right there
[1:16:25] and you can say so shall I.
[1:16:28] The son of God,
[1:16:30] the daughter of God. Amen. Going out
[1:16:33] from the mouth of God.
[1:16:36] That is a spoken word.
[1:16:39] A spoken word is a thought expressed.
[1:16:44] So how do you become the word?
[1:16:47] By listening to the spoken word of God.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Remember Revelation says the bride has
[1:16:55] made herself ready.
[1:16:59] Made herself ready with what?
[1:17:02] With the spoken word.
[1:17:04] The message the word was not revealed in
[1:17:07] our day for nothing.
[1:17:12] But it was revealed
[1:17:14] so you can see and look into the mirror.
[1:17:19] I am supposed to become the word.
[1:17:22] This is the only way I can be the bride
[1:17:24] of Christ.
[1:17:26] So you can say I shall not return unto
[1:17:28] God void
[1:17:31] after I have accomplished
[1:17:35] that which God pleases
[1:17:38] and I shall prosper
[1:17:41] in whatever that God has sent me for.
[1:17:46] Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] There is not enough devils in hell
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; that can stop you from completing God's
[1:17:54] purpose in your life.
[1:17:57] Hallelujah. There is not enough trials
[1:18:01] that can stop you
[1:18:04] because you are the word and you will
[1:18:07] accomplish
[1:18:09] each and everything
[1:18:11] that God said you will accomplish.
[1:18:14] Have breath in your body this morning.
[1:18:17] Why do you have breath? Because God is
[1:18:20] not yet done with you.
[1:18:23] He was done with you.
[1:18:25] you wouldn't be alive this morning
[1:18:28] because the prophet of God tells us you
[1:18:31] don't stay five minutes longer when God
[1:18:32] is done with you.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. So the mere fact that I'm
[1:18:40] standing here today.
[1:18:43] I got breath in my body.
[1:18:46] I know God is not yet done with me.
[1:18:50] I have a purpose to accomplish.
[1:18:53] And I know that purpose
[1:18:56] it is going to prosper.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are the word.
[1:19:02] You have the authority of the word.
[1:19:06] Remember the word carries the authority
[1:19:08] as the person who spoke it.
[1:19:13] So you have the authority that God had.
[1:19:18] That's why you can never ever fail.
[1:19:21] The word has never failed.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; It is not failing right now and it will
[1:19:28] never fail.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Why would God start failing on you this
[1:19:31] morning?
[1:19:34] He will never ever fail you
[1:19:36] because you are a part of him
[1:19:39] and you will always be victorious.
[1:19:42] Hallelujah. There is not enough sickness
[1:19:46] that can stop you from accomplishing the
[1:19:50] purpose of God.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is not enough trials
[1:19:56] that can stop you from accomplishing the
[1:20:00] purpose of God.
[1:20:02] Not enough addictions.
[1:20:05] Not enough afflictions.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Not enough depression
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; that can stop you.
[1:20:13] from getting to what God purpose you to.
[1:20:18] Hallelujah. There is no anxiety.
[1:20:23] Even your own sin
[1:20:26] cannot stop you
[1:20:29] in accomplishing his purpose in your
[1:20:31] life.
[1:20:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is no
[1:20:35] curse
[1:20:37] that can stand in your way.
[1:20:40] You can say your great greatgrandfather
[1:20:44] was cursed that you and your children
[1:20:48] would never prosper in life.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; That you will never ever make it in
[1:20:53] life.
[1:20:55] But I know Jesus when he hung on that
[1:20:57] cross.
[1:20:59] He broke that curse.
[1:21:02] So you can stand.
[1:21:04] You can curse that curse
[1:21:07] and say you have no authority.
[1:21:11] over me because I am the word of God.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because you are
[1:21:16] the word.
[1:21:18] You can be delivered
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; from the chains that's binding you
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; because God's word never fails.
[1:21:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; We were born on this earth with amnesia
[1:21:35] and we didn't know who we were.
[1:21:38] We thank God for the message of the
[1:21:39] word.
[1:21:41] We thank God for the opening of the
[1:21:42] word.
[1:21:44] We are no longer in confusion.
[1:21:48] We don't it's we are not people who are
[1:21:50] tossed about like we don't know what's
[1:21:51] going on.
[1:21:55] But God's word is sure
[1:21:59] because we know we have heard from our
[1:22:02] theophony.
[1:22:04] We have a representation in heaven.
[1:22:08] In Psalms 119,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Forever, oh Lord,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; thy word is settled in heaven
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; before it ever happens on earth,
[1:22:23] it is already done in heaven.
[1:22:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why when
[1:22:29] God when the disciples asked Jesus, how
[1:22:31] should we pray?"
[1:22:35] He said you pray saying let your will be
[1:22:37] done
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven.
[1:22:44] Why? Because thy word is settled in
[1:22:47] heaven.
[1:22:50] You are the word.
[1:22:52] You are settled in heaven.
[1:22:55] Your theophony does not have any
[1:22:56] sicknesses.
[1:22:59] Amen. Your theophony
[1:23:02] does not have infirmities.
[1:23:05] So when you are feeling sick,
[1:23:08] you got to kneel down and pray.
[1:23:11] He said, "Oh Lord, forever your word
[1:23:16] is settled in heaven.
[1:23:18] I know my theophony
[1:23:21] is settled in heaven.
[1:23:24] My theophony is not sick.
[1:23:27] So I need to be that.
[1:23:31] So I claim my healing
[1:23:34] because let it be on earth
[1:23:38] as it is in heaven.
[1:23:40] And God is not a man that he should lie.
[1:23:44] He will hear your heart's prayer.
[1:23:47] He will hear your heart's cry.
[1:23:49] He said, "If my people
[1:23:52] who are called by my name,
[1:23:55] if they humble themselves and pray,"
[1:23:58] he says, "I will hear from heaven,"
[1:24:02] not only will he hear
[1:24:04] and you said, "I will hear and I will
[1:24:06] heal your name."
[1:24:09] If you have a need this morning,
[1:24:12] just get on your knees
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I'm humbly coming before
[1:24:16] you
[1:24:18] because I know your word never fails.
[1:24:22] It never fail for the children of
[1:24:23] Israel.
[1:24:25] I know it's not going to fail for me."
[1:24:28] You say, "Lord, heal my land."
[1:24:31] You say, "Lord, heal my children."
[1:24:34] You say, "Lord, heal my bank account.
[1:24:39] He has no restrictions.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; He has no boundaries.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; He will say, he said, I will supply your
[1:24:47] needs
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; according to my riches and glory.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I know he owns
[1:24:54] everything in this whole world.
[1:24:57] He owns all the gold. He owns all the
[1:24:59] diamond.
[1:25:02] So how is he going to fail you?
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He will always
[1:25:07] come through for you.
[1:25:10] So you got to pray and say, "Lord, let
[1:25:14] your will be done on earth
[1:25:17] that is in heaven." Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] Hallelujah. And his word
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; will be made manifest in your life
[1:25:25] because remember you have a
[1:25:26] representation
[1:25:28] that is in heaven that is perfect
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; without spot,
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; without any wrinkle.
[1:25:36] without any blemish.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That's why he said in his word, "There
[1:25:42] shall be a glorious church
[1:25:46] without spot or wrinkle
[1:25:49] and no blemish
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; unto him."
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the bride which is supposed
[1:25:55] to become the word
[1:25:59] is taking her position as she was before
[1:26:02] the foundation of the world.
[1:26:06] And you can only be spot without wrinkle
[1:26:11] if you look into the mirror of the word
[1:26:13] of God
[1:26:16] because a mirror never lies.
[1:26:18] The mirror shows you who you are.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we were born on this
[1:26:23] earth,
[1:26:25] we were born with amnesia.
[1:26:28] We forgot everything.
[1:26:30] This brain cannot even go far.
[1:26:35] Your brain cannot even comprehend the
[1:26:37] word eternity.
[1:26:41] Eternity. We all say eternity. Eternity.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; But just ask yourself for a minute. What
[1:26:49] does eternity mean?
[1:26:52] No beginning.
[1:26:55] Can your mind comprehend something that
[1:26:56] doesn't have?
[1:27:01] Can your mind comprehend something that
[1:27:02] doesn't have no end?
[1:27:07] You cannot comprehend it
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; because our brain is fogged with
[1:27:12] amnesia.
[1:27:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But it's only
[1:27:18] the word
[1:27:20] that could dispel that amnesia.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Growing up,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; being exposed to all these things in the
[1:27:29] world,
[1:27:31] We forgot where we came from. We forgot
[1:27:35] who we are supposed to be
[1:27:39] coming up as little kids
[1:27:43] seeing all the different things
[1:27:47] having an impact on your brain
[1:27:52] and that's all you know that's all you
[1:27:53] think about.
[1:27:56] There is no way for your mind to go back
[1:27:58] to eternity.
[1:28:03] That's why parents
[1:28:05] you need to be careful
[1:28:07] what you are exposing your children to
[1:28:13] because their brain makes vivid
[1:28:16] imagination.
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:22] Whatever you show them,
[1:28:25] it's going to stick with them and it
[1:28:28] will make a longlasting impact.
[1:28:34] But we thank God for godly mamas.
[1:28:40] Amen. Who sit down with their children
[1:28:44] and teach them the word.
[1:28:47] The prophet of God calls them the fifth
[1:28:48] gospel.
[1:28:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Because you your uh your your children
[1:28:55] have they have your ear.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; They listen to you.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; So you better make sure
[1:29:04] you are imparting the right thing to
[1:29:06] them.
[1:29:09] I remember when I was growing up, the
[1:29:12] foundation that I have of the Bible,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; I didn't get it in church.
[1:29:18] I got it from home.
[1:29:21] Every night before I went to bed,
[1:29:24] my mom would read the Bible to me,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; read a Bible story to me,
[1:29:30] tell me what it means,
[1:29:33] tell me all the lessons it is,
[1:29:36] read the story of Jonah,
[1:29:39] telling me that you are supposed to
[1:29:40] listen to God.
[1:29:44] Oh, the foundation I had,
[1:29:47] it was because of a prayerful mother.
[1:29:51] who was taking her time every night
[1:29:55] to make sure I had a grasp on it.
[1:30:00] Remember the word says, "Train a child
[1:30:02] the way they are supposed to come out.
[1:30:11] When they grow up, they will not depart
[1:30:12] from it.
[1:30:15] So you would have done your duty.
[1:30:19] Say, Lord, I have done all I can.
[1:30:22] I put the rest in your hands.
[1:30:25] God's word never fails.
[1:30:27] He says that way will never depart from
[1:30:29] them.
[1:30:32] They might get lost along the way.
[1:30:37] But that word is a campus. It will bring
[1:30:40] them right back.
[1:30:44] Amen. Amen. So you better be careful
[1:30:46] what they are watching.
[1:30:51] The prophet tells us that eyes are the
[1:30:52] door to the soul.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; So whatever you see is not just ending
[1:30:57] on your eyes
[1:31:00] but it is going all the way into your
[1:31:02] soul
[1:31:04] and it is maturing in there
[1:31:07] and it will start affecting your
[1:31:09] actions.
[1:31:12] You let your kids watch you watch
[1:31:14] Superman
[1:31:20] Superman. After watching that movie of
[1:31:22] Superman,
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; you see they'll go get a sheet
[1:31:28] and tie it around their neck
[1:31:32] and they start running around
[1:31:35] trying to be like Superman.
[1:31:38] Give them to watch Spider-Man.
[1:31:42] Spider-Man,
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; you're going to be chasing all over in
[1:31:44] the house, jumping up and down the
[1:31:45] couches
[1:31:49] because Superman had an impact in them.
[1:31:55] They want to be like him, too.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; They want to fly around.
[1:32:01] Imagine other things that are evil
[1:32:06] that are getting into their mind.
[1:32:10] What are they going to do after that?
[1:32:13] So you need to be watchful.
[1:32:16] You need to be on the guard
[1:32:21] on what they are watching.
[1:32:25] Teach your children the word of God
[1:32:29] before they go to bed.
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:33] They are supposed to know
[1:32:35] that every day I need to pray.
[1:32:39] Every day when I wake up in the morning,
[1:32:43] I'm supposed to talk to my maker.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; They might not know what's going on,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; but down the road they will remember
[1:32:55] that. But the other day when we had a
[1:32:56] situation back home,
[1:32:59] daddy and mama prayed
[1:33:02] and God came and answered.
[1:33:04] If I pray right now,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; I know the same God can hear me too.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; We all know of Susanna Wesleyanesley.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; She had 19 children.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; But she had three hours every day
[1:33:25] to teach them the word
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; and to pray.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; And those days, they didn't have water
[1:33:32] that's running on the tank.
[1:33:36] They had to go and bring up the water in
[1:33:39] a well.
[1:33:44] When they were doing laundry, they had
[1:33:45] to manually do the laundry.
[1:33:49] But nowadays,
[1:33:53] the things you could do in three days,
[1:33:54] you can do it in three hours.
[1:33:59] You can do laundry whilst you're not in
[1:34:01] the laundry room.
[1:34:08] You just press a button in the
[1:34:09] vegetable.
[1:34:13] You can cook a whole meal without you
[1:34:14] being in the kitchen.
[1:34:19] You can get your groceries without even
[1:34:21] going grocery shopping. What's in your
[1:34:23] house?
[1:34:31] All the things you could do in three
[1:34:33] days,
[1:34:35] you can do it in a moment.
[1:34:38] People back then in the days they use a
[1:34:41] horse and buggy,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many days they would
[1:34:45] take to go to Chicago,
[1:34:48] but you just take about four hours.
[1:34:52] But with all that ease,
[1:34:56] with all that ease,
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; we don't have no time.
[1:35:01] We have all these things to help us save
[1:35:03] time,
[1:35:04] but we don't we still don't got enough
[1:35:06] time.
[1:35:08] The more we get, the less time we get,
[1:35:12] we don't have enough time to consecrate
[1:35:14] in prayer.
[1:35:17] But look at Susanna Wesley.
[1:35:20] Because of her dedication to her
[1:35:22] children,
[1:35:24] teaching them the word of God,
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; they came out the revivalist.
[1:35:31] John Wesley
[1:35:34] Wesley,
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Charles Wesley,
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Charles Wesley,
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; the greatest one of the greatest
[1:35:38] composers in history.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And John Wesley, the the the sixth
[1:35:43] eighth me sixth age messenger.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; John Wesley,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; sixth church age messenger.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. because that came from a mother
[1:35:57] who was teaching her children the word.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you don't
[1:36:03] know who you are raising.
[1:36:07] You might be raising an evangelist.
[1:36:11] You might be raising a great witnesser
[1:36:13] for the word of God.
[1:36:18] But you stay and just teach them the
[1:36:19] word.
[1:36:21] The prophet of God talks about this
[1:36:23] story
[1:36:25] of there's five there's a family that
[1:36:27] had five boys
[1:36:30] and when this five boy they were all
[1:36:31] staying in the same house
[1:36:35] when the first boy graduated
[1:36:40] he left and he went to the navy
[1:36:45] second
[1:36:48] fourth fifth all they went to the navy
[1:36:52] Then they sat down to investigate.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; They started asking, "Are you the one
[1:36:57] who was telling your children to get to
[1:36:59] the Navy?"
[1:37:03] They say, "No."
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; They asked those boys.
[1:37:07] Did you discuss and say, "Hey, when we
[1:37:09] are done, we need to go to the Navy."
[1:37:16] They said, "No, we never ever talked
[1:37:19] about it.
[1:37:21] So they were trying to figure out and
[1:37:23] find out
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; what was influencing this children.
[1:37:31] Then they found out
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; that in their bedroom.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; They all they all slept in the same
[1:37:38] bedroom.
[1:37:40] There was a big picture
[1:37:43] of a ship that was sailing on the calm
[1:37:45] sea.
[1:37:50] And that picture was influencing them.
[1:37:54] So every morning when they woke up,
[1:37:58] the ship is the first thing they saw
[1:38:02] before going to bed. The ship is the
[1:38:05] last thing they saw.
[1:38:07] If one just walked into his room,
[1:38:12] what they saw on the wall
[1:38:14] was the sheep on the sea.
[1:38:17] And it had an impact on them
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and they started craving for that.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; They had an unknowingly desire
[1:38:30] to be in that ship.
[1:38:34] So you see the impact that that ship,
[1:38:36] the future of the ship had on them.
[1:38:42] the rest of their lives.
[1:38:46] For the rest of my life, I want to be in
[1:38:48] the Navy.
[1:38:51] It was because of a ship picture of a
[1:38:53] ship.
[1:38:56] And the prophet of God says, "Now if the
[1:38:59] picture of a shu impressed boys to
[1:39:01] become navy men,
[1:39:05] sailors of the sea,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; what are the picture of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:10] Christ?
[1:39:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Always have the right thing before your
[1:39:17] children.
[1:39:20] Bring up a child in the way that it
[1:39:22] should go.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Bring it up and teach it right. It will
[1:39:27] certainly won't depart from it.
[1:39:32] If you let your children hang the
[1:39:34] pictures of Michael Jackson,
[1:39:38] what do you expect them to do?
[1:39:40] They're going to start break dancing and
[1:39:42] moonwalking.
[1:39:45] That's all they are seeing.
[1:39:48] Michael Jackson is having an impact on
[1:39:50] them.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; So you need to be careful
[1:39:55] and look what do you have in your room.
[1:39:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Cuz that will
[1:40:01] have an impact on your life.
[1:40:05] You should have a picture of the Lord
[1:40:06] Jesus Christ in your house.
[1:40:09] Amen. Amen. Every time you wake up, you
[1:40:13] are looking at your savior
[1:40:15] and you say, "Thank you, Lord, for
[1:40:18] giving me the breath of life."
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Before you go to bed,
[1:40:23] you are looking at the face of Jesus
[1:40:25] Christ.
[1:40:27] And you say, "Thank you, Lord, for
[1:40:29] taking me through the day.
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] If it wasn't for you,
[1:40:35] I wouldn't have made it.
[1:40:38] Hallelujah.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; So you put the right thing in front of
[1:40:41] you.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And God will always make sure
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; that he is faithful to his word.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; So we are speaking about looking into
[1:40:56] the mirror of the word
[1:40:59] and realizing what our picture we are
[1:41:02] supposed to look like.
[1:41:05] and by the word
[1:41:08] conform into the image that God has for
[1:41:10] us
[1:41:13] which was before the foundation of the
[1:41:15] world.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what people say about
[1:41:18] you.
[1:41:21] What matters is what God says about you
[1:41:25] because you don't know my real picture.
[1:41:29] You have never seen the real me
[1:41:33] because my real me is my soul.
[1:41:36] My soul has a representation in heaven.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you don't
[1:41:41] have a right to tell me what I can do or
[1:41:44] not do
[1:41:47] based on what you think
[1:41:51] if it goes against the word of God.
[1:41:55] What I listen to is what God says about
[1:41:58] me.
[1:42:00] What you think about yourself doesn't
[1:42:01] even matter.
[1:42:04] contradicts the word of God
[1:42:07] because you are not working in your
[1:42:09] purpose
[1:42:11] but whatever you are doing you say Lord
[1:42:14] what do you want for me in my life
[1:42:17] and you walk in that because that's what
[1:42:19] you want
[1:42:21] so your prayer is supposed to be
[1:42:25] Lord I want to come to the full
[1:42:26] potential
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:30] what you had me in your mind
[1:42:36] before the foundation of the world.
[1:42:38] When people look at you, they might see
[1:42:41] a liar.
[1:42:44] But when God looks at you, he is not
[1:42:46] seeing a liar. He is a son of God.
[1:42:50] People look at you and they say you are
[1:42:52] a drunk.
[1:42:55] God is looking at you. He is seeing his
[1:42:58] son.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People are calling you what
[1:43:02] they think by what they are seeing.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; But God looks at what he had for you
[1:43:09] before the foundation of the world.
[1:43:14] You remember that prostitute
[1:43:17] wiping the feet of Jesus with her hair
[1:43:21] and broke her alabaster box,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; washing the feet of Jesus with her
[1:43:27] tears.
[1:43:29] People
[1:43:34] were calling her a prostitute.
[1:43:37] Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; People were calling her a prostitute.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus was looking at her,
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; he wasn't seeing a prostitute.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He saw a candidate
[1:43:51] to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:55] He says, "You are going to receive the
[1:43:56] Holy Ghost."
[1:43:58] She was one of those who were in the
[1:44:00] upper chamber.
[1:44:03] [Music]
[1:44:04] The Pharisees would not probably not
[1:44:06] even allow her in church.
[1:44:10] God was looking different.
[1:44:13] She was one of the first witnesses
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:17] to witness the resurrection of Jesus.
[1:44:22] Hallelujah. Why? Because when Jes when
[1:44:24] she met Jesus,
[1:44:27] she looked into the mirror of the word
[1:44:30] and she said, "I'm removing this old
[1:44:32] garment.
[1:44:35] I'm no longer a prostitute,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; but I am a daughter of God."
[1:44:40] Rahab was a prostitute.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; But when God was looking at her, he
[1:44:46] said, "You are the great grandmother of
[1:44:48] God."
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; He grafted her.
[1:44:53] into the genealogy of Jesus.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But when people were looking at her,
[1:45:00] they were saying she is a prostitute.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; But when God was looking at her, he was
[1:45:05] looking at his blood.
[1:45:07] Remember, God does not look at you.
[1:45:10] He looks at your representation.
[1:45:14] Your representation says you are
[1:45:15] perfect.
[1:45:18] Blameless.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So look at what God
[1:45:25] has for you.
[1:45:27] The children of Israel were supposed to
[1:45:29] get in uh to to cross over to the
[1:45:31] promised land.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; If they used the quicker route,
[1:45:41] they were going to take three days
[1:45:44] to move from uh from to move from Egypt
[1:45:47] to go to the promised land.
[1:45:50] But God allowed them to wander in the
[1:45:52] wilderness for 40 years.
[1:45:57] If they had gotten to the promised land
[1:45:58] in three days,
[1:46:01] where would Raha be?
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:05] She probably wasn't even born yet.
[1:46:09] And God in his multi-purpose
[1:46:14] of planning his things,
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; he had Rahab on his mind.
[1:46:19] By the end of those 40 years,
[1:46:22] Rahab was ready.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because why? She
[1:46:26] was important to God.
[1:46:29] You are important to God.
[1:46:32] People might make you think that a
[1:46:35] you are not worth much.
[1:46:37] But you are important to God.
[1:46:40] God could change a whole route.
[1:46:45] Someone who was considered a prostitute.
[1:46:49] What about you, the bride of Christ?
[1:46:52] He can change situations.
[1:46:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; So, you are supposed to call yourself
[1:47:00] what God knows you as
[1:47:04] the book of judges. We read of Gideon.
[1:47:07] The angel of the Lord came to Gideon.
[1:47:11] Gideon was busy hiding.
[1:47:15] In verse 11 it says, "And there came an
[1:47:16] angel of the Lord
[1:47:18] and set on an oak which is an in offer
[1:47:23] that pertain to Jo the Aizeride."
[1:47:28] His son Gideon threshed wheat by the
[1:47:30] wine press
[1:47:34] to hide it from the Medidianites.
[1:47:39] He was in an act of cowardice.
[1:47:43] He was busy hiding from the enemy.
[1:47:48] But whilst he was in the act of hiding
[1:47:50] from the enemy,
[1:47:52] the angel of the Lord came to him
[1:47:55] and he says, "The Lord is with thee."
[1:47:59] Thou mighty man of valor.
[1:48:03] Is he a mighty man of valor?
[1:48:06] When he is hiding, running away from
[1:48:10] God had another representation of Gideon
[1:48:16] that he is a mighty warrior
[1:48:19] that he is a mighty man of valor
[1:48:22] and he brought victory
[1:48:25] to the children of Israel.
[1:48:27] Why? Because he realized
[1:48:30] he looked into the mirror of what God
[1:48:32] was saying about him
[1:48:35] and saying right now I look like a
[1:48:36] coward,
[1:48:39] but the word of God is telling me
[1:48:43] that I am a mighty man of God.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; This morning you got to stand up and
[1:48:49] say,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; "Lord, what are you saying about me?"
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I might be in
[1:48:56] the I might be in the state
[1:48:59] of cowering and hiding away from my
[1:49:01] enemies.
[1:49:03] But the word of God comes to you and
[1:49:04] tells you,
[1:49:06] you are a mighty man of God. You are
[1:49:09] more than a conqueror.
[1:49:11] You say I have so much sin.
[1:49:14] I have so many things I cannot overcome.
[1:49:18] When the word of God comes to you, it
[1:49:21] tells you you are blameless.
[1:49:23] You have done it in the first place.
[1:49:26] You are without spot or wrinkle.
[1:49:30] You don't have a blemish
[1:49:33] because that's what God
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; knows you as.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Moving on to Shem. God.
[1:49:42] She was right there. They were being
[1:49:45] terrorized by the Philistines.
[1:49:50] And he was there thinking.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; He was looking at his wife.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; He saw his wife and their his kids, they
[1:49:58] were getting they were getting frail
[1:50:02] because every time they had a harvest,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; the Philistines would come and take it
[1:50:08] away from them.
[1:50:11] And he was there pondering,
[1:50:16] stressing out,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; But then he remembered.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am a son of Abraham.
[1:50:28] This is the prophet of God says
[1:50:30] begin to think,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; but I am a son of Abraham.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; I am of the tribe and the lineage.
[1:50:39] circumcised
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; and I know that my God still lives
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; and there is a crisis at hand.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:50:52] him.
[1:50:55] When did the spirit of the Lord come
[1:50:56] upon him?
[1:50:59] You realize
[1:51:01] he has a representation in the word
[1:51:05] and that representation says he's the
[1:51:07] son of Abraham.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; As soon as he got that revelation,
[1:51:14] he was anointed by the spirit of the
[1:51:16] Lord.
[1:51:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, do you have a crisis at
[1:51:21] hand this morning?
[1:51:24] Just look into that word. He tells you
[1:51:26] you are a son of Abraham.
[1:51:28] tells you you are a daughter of Abraham.
[1:51:31] As soon as you get that revelation,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; God will anoint you.
[1:51:38] You anoint you with a spirit of
[1:51:39] overcoming.
[1:51:42] Abraham was an overcomer.
[1:51:45] So shame, he realizes there's a crisis
[1:51:49] at hand
[1:51:51] and you said, "I've been living under my
[1:51:52] privileges for too long,
[1:51:57] but because I'm a son of Abraham,
[1:52:00] the promise that God gave to Abraham, my
[1:52:03] father,
[1:52:05] it applies to me." And the spirit of the
[1:52:08] Lord come upon him.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; He did not have any training to be a
[1:52:12] soldier.
[1:52:15] You do not have any warfare training.
[1:52:19] You didn't know which weapon to use or
[1:52:20] not use.
[1:52:23] He took a little stick, which is an ox
[1:52:26] god. And he ran out there in the middle
[1:52:29] of the road
[1:52:32] with that ox god in his hand. He started
[1:52:35] getting reckless
[1:52:37] because you were standing on the word of
[1:52:39] God. Hallelujah. Remember David got
[1:52:42] reckless.
[1:52:44] when he saw Goliath because he said, "I
[1:52:47] have an anointing of being a king in my
[1:52:49] life.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; So Goliath is not going to kill me
[1:52:55] until I become king.
[1:52:57] So it doesn't matter what I do.
[1:53:00] I know I'm going to overcome."
[1:53:03] And Shem stood right there. And he said,
[1:53:06] "I am a son of Abraham."
[1:53:09] and he was anointed and he said, "We
[1:53:12] have a promise
[1:53:14] to possess the gates of the enemy."
[1:53:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I might not have a spear.
[1:53:21] I might not have a sword.
[1:53:24] I don't know how that is going to
[1:53:25] happen.
[1:53:27] All I know is I'm going to possess the
[1:53:29] gate."
[1:53:31] He stood in the middle of the road
[1:53:34] and he whooped all of them 600
[1:53:36] Philistines.
[1:53:38] How did it happen? I don't know. All I
[1:53:41] know is he possessed the gates of God.
[1:53:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why? Because he
[1:53:47] know that he was a Israelite.
[1:53:51] He had a right. He had a right to his
[1:53:54] God-given rights.
[1:53:57] Brother, sister, you have a right to
[1:53:58] your God-given right.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; The word of God tells us
[1:54:05] you are the children of Abraham.
[1:54:09] Galatians 3 says, "Know ye therefore,
[1:54:12] they which are of faith,
[1:54:14] the same are the children of Abraham."
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; So you are a son of Abraham.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; You are a daughter of Abraham.
[1:54:23] The promise of Abraham.
[1:54:25] It is for you this morning.
[1:54:28] You get that revelation.
[1:54:31] You look into the mirror of the word.
[1:54:34] Say, Lord,
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; I'm stepping into that perfect vision.
[1:54:40] I know no enemy can stand before me.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you have rights.
[1:54:48] God-given rights. And the Holy Ghost
[1:54:51] will enforce those God-given rights.
[1:54:54] Amen. And the prophet of God says, "And
[1:54:58] any man here that's circumcised by the
[1:55:01] spirit of God
[1:55:04] that's born again,
[1:55:06] any of you people that's sick,
[1:55:10] the devil is a bluff.
[1:55:12] The devil is a liar." You can look at
[1:55:15] him in the face and say, "You are a
[1:55:18] liar. He doesn't have the ability of
[1:55:20] telling the truth."
[1:55:23] So whatever he says the opposite is true
[1:55:28] if he says you cannot make it
[1:55:31] I have already make it made it.
[1:55:34] If he says you cannot be healed
[1:55:37] you can say because you are a liar I am
[1:55:40] already healed.
[1:55:41] If he says you cannot be bride
[1:55:45] thank you for letting me know.
[1:55:48] I already know.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; I have already made it.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; God has accepted me.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when God is looking at you,
[1:56:00] he looks at your representation.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; And God has already accepted you.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Remember why did God accept the
[1:56:07] sacrifice of Abel?
[1:56:11] Because he had already accepted Abel
[1:56:14] before his sacrifice.
[1:56:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; So you have been already accepted.
[1:56:21] Why? Because we know the lamb of God,
[1:56:25] our ultimate sacrifice.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He was sacrificed on the cross of
[1:56:30] Calvary.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; God accepted that sacrifice.
[1:56:36] Because God accepted that sacrifice,
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; I know he had already accepted me
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; So I know I'm already accepted.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot tell me I'm not going to
[1:56:52] make it.
[1:56:55] Satan cannot tell me I'm not brid.
[1:56:58] But I know I have already made it. Why?
[1:57:02] God already accepted me.
[1:57:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan lie to you this morning.
[1:57:10] He might tell you you have crossed the
[1:57:11] line of judgment
[1:57:14] that you are in this place this morning.
[1:57:18] God has not forgotten about you.
[1:57:21] The fact that you are saying amen to the
[1:57:23] word of God
[1:57:25] because you are hearing from your
[1:57:26] theophony
[1:57:29] because you are hearing it from your
[1:57:30] theophony
[1:57:32] that you have already made it.
[1:57:36] You might fall today,
[1:57:38] get up tomorrow.
[1:57:40] But because God has already accepted
[1:57:42] you, he accepted the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:57:46] Christ.
[1:57:47] So when he said it is finished,
[1:57:51] everything was finished. I don't care
[1:57:54] what it is. You can also stand and say
[1:57:57] in the face of the devil,
[1:57:59] you can say it is finished.
[1:58:02] My trials are finished.
[1:58:05] My addictions are finished.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; My shortcomings are finished.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; The sin you've been struggling with for
[1:58:13] so many years,
[1:58:17] you're going to look the devil in the
[1:58:19] face
[1:58:20] and say, "It was not like this
[1:58:23] and the mind of God. When I stand in the
[1:58:26] mirror of the word of God,
[1:58:29] I stand in the stature of a perfect man.
[1:58:32] God looks at me. He says, "You haven't
[1:58:35] done it in the first place."
[1:58:38] So I know I have not done it.
[1:58:42] Satan is the accuser of brethren,
[1:58:44] but he cannot accuse you anymore
[1:58:48] because the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:58:52] once and for all,
[1:58:54] you don't need any other sacrifice.
[1:58:57] what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary.
[1:59:01] It is enough for you.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; He did it 2,000 years ago.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to wait for another
[1:59:08] sacrifice.
[1:59:09] You don't need another forgiving.
[1:59:13] You need to know.
[1:59:15] He already did it. It is done and
[1:59:18] settled.
[1:59:20] You just have to believe
[1:59:22] and claim and say, "Lord, what you did
[1:59:24] 2,000 years ago
[1:59:27] I claim it this morning.
[1:59:30] What you did for me on the cross of
[1:59:31] Calvary,
[1:59:33] I claim it.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; What you did for me before the
[1:59:36] foundation of the world,
[1:59:39] claim it in Jesus name
[1:59:42] because God's word never fails.
[1:59:45] You are the spoken word.
[1:59:48] The spoken word of God never fails.
[1:59:52] Hallelujah.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Why does it not fail? because you are a
[1:59:55] part of God. We thank God for the
[1:59:58] opening of the seals,
[2:00:00] the opening of the word of God
[2:00:03] to open our eyes.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; That brother, sister, you are on the
[2:00:08] back part of God's word.
[2:00:10] God had you on his mind.
[2:00:13] He thought of you. Hallelujah.
[2:00:16] Hallelujah. When Jesus was walking to
[2:00:17] Calvary,
[2:00:19] he could have stopped and not go
[2:00:21] anymore.
[2:00:22] But what he thought of you,
[2:00:25] he thought of himself.
[2:00:27] He saw where you are seated right now.
[2:00:30] And he says, "Father, nevertheless,
[2:00:33] I will go. It doesn't matter how hard it
[2:00:36] is." And remember, he went on as a man.
[2:00:42] He carried your sin.
[2:00:44] He carried your affliction.
[2:00:47] And he felt each and every lick
[2:00:51] that those Roman soldiers put on him.
[2:00:54] But he says, "I will go." He had that
[2:00:58] crown of thorns on his head.
[2:01:00] He says, "Father, nevertheless,
[2:01:03] because of my daughter,
[2:01:05] I see my son in 2024.
[2:01:09] He's trying to overcome.
[2:01:12] Satan is trying to confuse him.
[2:01:15] But because of him, I will go all the
[2:01:18] way.
[2:01:20] I will pay the price.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; So brother, sister, today you can stand
[2:01:26] and you say, "I am bloodbought,
[2:01:30] blood purchased
[2:01:32] by the blood of Jesus Christ." And he
[2:01:35] paid the full price.
[2:01:37] He paid a debt he did not owe.
[2:01:40] Hallelujah.
[2:01:42] You owe me debt you could not pay.
[2:01:47] But I'm so glad Christ Jesus,
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; he paid it all for me. So now I stand
[2:01:53] justified
[2:01:55] and I can say, "Oh yes, I am a child of
[2:01:59] the king because his royal blood
[2:02:03] flows through my veins.
[2:02:06] I who was wretched
[2:02:08] and vile
[2:02:10] now can say
[2:02:12] praise God.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; I am a child of the king.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say praise God?
[2:02:19] I am a child of the king. Hallelujah.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; You got to stand up on your feet,
[2:02:26] walk with your chest out
[2:02:29] and say, "I am royalty."
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is no rod block that
[2:02:35] can stop you
[2:02:38] because you are royalty.
[2:02:40] The blood of Christ flows in your veins.
[2:02:44] Oh, hallelujah. Let it stand upon our
[2:02:46] feet.
[2:02:48] Oh brother, sisters, you have made it.
[2:02:52] You have made it. the picture that God
[2:02:55] had you
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; on the back part of his mind,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; it will never ever fail.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Because he is God
[2:03:06] and because he is God, he will never
[2:03:09] fail. And because you are a part of God
[2:03:14] also never fail. So you got to know that
[2:03:17] each and every promise
[2:03:20] concerning you that is in the word of
[2:03:21] God
[2:03:24] Claim it.
[2:03:27] Believe it.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; When you believe it,
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; it will become made manifest in your
[2:03:34] life.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Remember when the angel came to Mary,
[2:03:39] he says, Mary, you shall give birth,
[2:03:42] a son, and he shall be called Jesus.
[2:03:45] She says, I don't know how that's going
[2:03:47] to happen.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; But because she was standing on the
[2:03:51] word,
[2:03:53] She says, "Lord,
[2:03:55] let it be unto me according to thy
[2:03:58] word." The prophet said, "As soon as she
[2:04:01] say that,
[2:04:04] that's when conception took place."
[2:04:07] As soon as you believe the word of God,
[2:04:11] that's when he will start working on
[2:04:13] you.
[2:04:15] That's when it will start having an
[2:04:16] effect in your life.
[2:04:20] So whatever it is just say Lord I
[2:04:23] believe
[2:04:25] Lord I receive.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why only believe
[2:04:32] was it was a theme in the ministry of
[2:04:34] God.
[2:04:40] They say the angel loves that song.
[2:04:44] Why? Because believing
[2:04:47] is an atmosphere
[2:04:50] atmosphere where all things can be made
[2:04:52] possible.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is here this morning.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; He's here to hear your heart's cry.
[2:05:04] Devil, the devil might say you might not
[2:05:06] feel him.
[2:05:09] You don't have to because the word of
[2:05:11] God says
[2:05:13] the high priest
[2:05:15] is touched by the feeling of our
[2:05:16] infirmities.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through right
[2:05:20] now,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; he says, "I know.
[2:05:24] He can feel it.
[2:05:27] God who hears
[2:05:30] and when he hears, he will answer your
[2:05:33] prayer.
[2:05:35] So only believe
[2:05:37] all things are possible.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord,
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; let it be unto me according to you."
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord,
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; I receive.
[2:05:49] Lord,
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[2:05:59] Only
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:02] believe.
[2:06:06] All things are possible.
[2:06:13] Only
[2:06:16] believe.
[2:06:19] Oh,
[2:06:22] live.
[2:06:27] Oh,
[2:06:29] we believe.
[2:06:34] All things are possible.
[2:06:41] only
[2:06:43] just raise your voice and say only
[2:06:45] believe.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Let us just raise our hands and worship
[2:06:52] him this morning.
[2:06:54] Say, "Lord, I believe
[2:06:57] each and every word you spoke
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; concerning me.
[2:07:04] I receive each and every one of it.
[2:07:08] Only,
[2:07:11] only believe.
[2:07:15] Only
[2:07:17] believe."
[2:07:20] Oh,
[2:07:23] we believe
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:28] all things are possible.
[2:07:35] Oh,
[2:07:37] oh, sing. Jesus is here.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; He is here to hear your heart's cry.
[2:07:49] He is here to answer your needs.
[2:07:52] Don't let him pass by.
[2:07:56] Say pass me.
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:00] Oh for Jesus.
[2:08:05] Jesus is here.
[2:08:11] You don't have to be loud,
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; but he can hear your heart cry.
[2:08:18] And when you call for him,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; he will draw nigh to you,
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; he is here for you this morning.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Just reach out and touch the hem of his
[2:08:31] garment.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[2:08:44] [Applause]
[2:08:46] I know
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:08:53] all things are possible
[2:08:56] in the presence of the Almighty God.
[2:09:00] It doesn't matter what it is.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how long it has,
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; but because you are in the presence of
[2:09:09] the Lord,
[2:09:12] he will take care of your need.
[2:09:15] He can strike forth his hand and touch
[2:09:17] you.
[2:09:19] He can change your situation.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I've been struggling with
[2:09:24] this for 20 years."
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Remember the woman who had the issue of
[2:09:30] blood
[2:09:33] touch that he often
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:37] believed.
[2:09:39] And she says because I have touched the
[2:09:41] hand of the master
[2:09:43] today the issue of blood stops.
[2:09:47] Whatever issue you are dealing with
[2:09:51] whatever addiction you are dealing with
[2:09:55] God is here this morning.
[2:09:58] He is here to stop that issue.
[2:10:05] Lord, I believe
[2:10:10] all things
[2:10:13] are possible.
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:16] Yes, Lord.
[2:10:19] Let's raise our voices and say, "Lord, I
[2:10:21] receive."
[2:10:24] Lord,
[2:10:27] say, "Lord, I receive what you did for
[2:10:29] me on Calvary.
[2:10:33] I know your sacrifice was enough for me.
[2:10:38] When you said it is finished,
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; I receive it right now.
[2:10:46] Say, Lord, I receive.
[2:10:49] [Music]
[2:10:52] Lord, I
[2:10:55] raise your voice and say, Lord,
[2:11:00] I receive.
[2:11:04] All things
[2:11:07] are possible.
[2:11:11] Lord, I pray.
[2:11:15] Jesus is here.
[2:11:20] Oh brother, sister, he is here to hear
[2:11:21] us.
[2:11:25] He is not a man that he should lie,
[2:11:29] but his word will come to pass in your
[2:11:32] life.
[2:11:34] Just say, Lord, I'm accepting what you
[2:11:36] did.
[2:11:38] I'm accepting your promises.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; You said, I'm blameless.
[2:11:44] I'm claiming it. Say,
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; I see so many spots and wrinkles.
[2:11:50] But I claim that I'm blameless.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; All
[2:11:59] things are possible.
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:05] Jesus,
[2:12:08] as the music plays,
[2:12:10] wherever you are,
[2:12:13] just talk to your maker.
[2:12:16] He's here to hear your heart.
[2:12:22] He is touched by the filling of your
[2:12:24] infirmity.
[2:12:28] Say, "Lord,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; thank you for the opening of your word.
[2:12:33] Now I know
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; that I am a son of God.
[2:12:39] I know I have a representation in glory.
[2:12:44] Representation will never fail.
[2:12:48] And because I have a representation,
[2:12:51] I know I have already made it.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Satan, you are a bluff.
[2:12:59] You cannot do nothing to God's children.
[2:13:03] You are defeated this morning.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; You have no right to put your dirty
[2:13:08] hands
[2:13:11] on the children of God.
[2:13:14] Dear heavenly father,
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; I pray you straighten out your hand. Oh
[2:13:19] God,

[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; fill us with the Holy Ghost, oh God.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, transform our lives.
[2:13:31] But someone is struggling
[2:13:35] with living a Christian life
[2:13:39] saying my life is not measuring up to
[2:13:42] what your word say.
[2:13:45] Lord I pray this morning.
[2:13:48] May you give us enough grace
[2:13:52] so that we can reach out
[2:13:56] and have you come in our lives.
[2:14:00] So you can touch our lives. Oh God,
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; transform us.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; We are tired of living in our sin.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; We are tired of living a defeated life.
[2:14:15] But Lord, we we know Lord
[2:14:18] that when we look in the mirror of your
[2:14:20] word,
[2:14:22] our amnesia is dispelled.
[2:14:25] So we stand with our hands raised
[2:14:29] in total surrender. Oh God,
[2:14:34] we surrender ourselves to you.
[2:14:38] Come in our lives.
[2:14:40] Have full preeminence in our lives.
[2:14:44] We don't want to be like Samson
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; who just gave you his strength.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; But we give you our everything.
[2:14:55] Take my life, oh Lord.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Take my voice.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Take my hand.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Take my feet and use it for your glory.
[2:15:07] For all I want
[2:15:09] is to please you, oh God.
[2:15:12] Stand with that image.
[2:15:15] I can become the word.
[2:15:19] I know your word never fails.
[2:15:22] I will never fail.

[2:15:27] [Music]

[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; in the last days there will be a bride
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; that will stand without a spot or
[2:15:37] wrinkle.

[2:15:42] and we say we are that bride oh God
[2:15:46] presented to you.

[2:16:15] Lord,
[2:16:17] but we know
[2:16:19] that you know
[2:16:22] what they need.

[2:16:28] in the office of a priest,
[2:16:33] interceding for your children, oh God.
