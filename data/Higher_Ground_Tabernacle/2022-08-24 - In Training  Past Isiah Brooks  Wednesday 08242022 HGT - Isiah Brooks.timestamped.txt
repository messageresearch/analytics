[41:42] God
[41:44] Hallelujah
[41:46] I appreciate him kind of holding the
[41:48] service for a while for me because
[41:51] the enemy tried to pull a trick on me I
[41:53] thought my uh
[41:54] iPad was charging up when it was
[41:56] charging down
[41:57] so
[41:59] by the grace of God we're here
[42:02] and we're just going to go right into
[42:04] the word of the Lord and
[42:06] when it goes out Jesus steps in
[42:09] amen you love the Lord
[42:14] I love music
[42:16] of all kind
[42:21] I just do I can't help it
[42:23] just in me
[42:26] when it comes to worshiping the Lord is
[42:28] what I'm speaking of
[42:29] God is good to us
[42:31] and he's worthy to be praised
[42:34] no matter what you feel like you have to
[42:37] put forth your best effort sometimes
[42:39] just to
[42:41] tell the devil no matter what
[42:43] I'm gonna do it any on how
[42:46] amen
[42:48] we have just a little subject tonight
[42:50] and it's actually
[42:53] um dealing with the training
[42:55] what God is doing for us we spoke a
[42:58] message about the Shekinah Glory and and
[43:01] when we were in
[43:03] um
[43:05] Murfreesboro we spoke on he is she is
[43:09] Shekinah
[43:10] but you know those things are really
[43:13] good to say and it's really good to know
[43:14] but you also need to know that we're in
[43:17] an army and what God is doing for us
[43:20] today is what uh he's already planned to
[43:24] do
[43:25] and as I said you know when it comes to
[43:27] God we must realize that the battle has
[43:29] already been fought and the victory has
[43:31] already been won
[43:33] you know it's just like brother Branham
[43:34] say even the Gospel of Jesus Christ when
[43:36] we preach the gospel we preach to that
[43:37] everybody's going to be saved we preach
[43:40] like everybody is bride but we know by
[43:42] God's grace everybody is not but we have
[43:45] been commanded to throw it out like that
[43:47] to put it out like that so that God so
[43:49] that um
[43:50] those who are ordained to catch it will
[43:54] catch it by the grace of God you love
[43:58] the Lord and we appreciate God and all
[44:01] that he's doing as we stand
[44:03] let us go right to the word of God
[44:07] we're going to come from first Samuel
[44:09] the 17th chapter I know our brother
[44:11] Isaiah preached on David a little bit
[44:14] and you know I was inspired by his
[44:16] message but I'm just going to go a
[44:18] different a little different way than
[44:20] what he went
[44:22] um you know I appreciate all the help
[44:23] God has given us and we are in a time
[44:26] that we must um
[44:28] girdle up The Lawns of our minds we must
[44:32] be sober
[44:33] by God's grace and I could have
[44:36] announced I could have used as the power
[44:38] and the authority of the Bride but I
[44:41] wanted to to emphasize the word training
[44:44] uh training for the battle and that's
[44:47] where we are right now because there is
[44:51] a great battle and we understand that
[44:53] the battle is basically fought within
[44:55] our minds right now it's between belief
[44:57] and unbelief faith and disbelief but we
[45:01] we know that um in it all God is going
[45:05] to work out his will I I love the very
[45:07] fact that before even God laid the plan
[45:09] out in the Physical Realm uh Satan had
[45:13] was already defeated
[45:16] amen first Samuel the 17th chapter we're
[45:19] going to read the 33rd verse
[45:22] beginning there
[45:28] and Saul said to David Thou Art not
[45:33] Thou Art not able to go against the
[45:36] Philistine to fight with him
[45:38] for thou art but a youth and a man of
[45:42] war from
[45:44] he and for thou art but a youth and he a
[45:48] man of war from his Youth and David said
[45:51] unto Saul thy servant
[45:53] kept his father's sheep and there came a
[45:57] lion and a bear
[45:59] and took a lamb out of the flock
[46:02] and I went out after him and I smote him
[46:06] and delivered him out of his mouth when
[46:10] he arose against me I caught him by his
[46:14] beard and smote him and slew him I love
[46:18] David's attitude because he was not
[46:20] going to allow the devil to steal not
[46:24] even one of his sheep and he went after
[46:27] the enemy and that's what I feel like we
[46:30] sometimes fail to do when somebody Falls
[46:33] sick uh whether it be with cancer or
[46:36] would it whether it be with any type of
[46:38] disease that will take us out we
[46:41] sometimes fear but David says there is
[46:44] no fear for the Lord is my shepherd we
[46:48] we don't look at conditions we don't
[46:51] look at what the devil calls
[46:53] circumstances
[46:55] by faith
[46:56] this is our our Revelation and it's not
[46:59] by our faith the just shall live by his
[47:03] faith we've moved up to the ladder you
[47:06] know when we were in denomination and
[47:07] stuff like that many things were done by
[47:09] and through our own faith that's why
[47:11] they were able to say Lord have I not
[47:13] done this and Lord have I not done that
[47:15] but in this day the just shall live by
[47:18] his faith because we've moved from just
[47:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost into a
[47:23] realm where Christ himself is standing
[47:25] as the mighty angel in the mighty
[47:27] Soldier before us
[47:30] amen
[47:32] you love the Lord
[47:34] and when I and I went after him and
[47:36] smoked him and delivered it delivered it
[47:38] out of his mouth and when he aroused
[47:40] against me I caught him by his beard and
[47:43] smoked him and slew him thy servants
[47:46] stood both The Lion and the bear and
[47:49] this uncircumcised Philistine shall be
[47:52] as one of them seeing he hath defied the
[47:55] armies of the Lord of our God right
[47:58] let's turn to Proverbs 28 15.
[48:04] and I'm going to read it from the other
[48:06] new version or the better version of csb
[48:09] uh but it gives a clear uh understanding
[48:13] to uh what David was against because
[48:16] David wrote this he says
[48:18] 28 15.
[48:20] a wicked ruler
[48:23] over a helpless people
[48:25] is like a roaring lion
[48:28] or a charging bear now he describes his
[48:34] uh basically what he went through with
[48:37] Goliath but you see uh we must
[48:40] understand that David had no fear
[48:42] because he knew God was with him let us
[48:45] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[48:47] you and we thank you for your Amazing
[48:49] Grace we thank you for being so good to
[48:52] us and so kind to us Lord without you
[48:54] Jesus we would be nothing and we pray
[48:57] father God that you would bless this
[48:59] service in a special way give us what we
[49:02] stand in need of Lord tonight and we'll
[49:06] be as we say careful to give you the
[49:08] praise Glory and Honor in your in your
[49:11] lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[49:14] you may be seated
[49:20] right now we're at a time where we must
[49:22] understand amen that the battle is not
[49:25] going to get easier we're at a tough
[49:28] time there's a time uh where we must
[49:30] understand that uh it's been ordained
[49:34] for us just as much it's been it was
[49:36] ordained for David to fight Goliath now
[49:39] the truth of the matter is he never
[49:40] thought about one day he would be
[49:43] fighting a giant but what we must
[49:46] understand that that the opposition that
[49:49] is now facing us is more like a giant
[49:52] it's something that it's with your
[49:55] natural eye you can't possibly think you
[49:58] can defeat them but we understand by
[50:01] God's grace that the the the the god
[50:03] that we serve is not only uh uh has
[50:07] brought down has opened up the word of
[50:09] God but he himself is here and he's now
[50:12] here to occupy our bodies to fight Even
[50:17] in our bodies and it was it wasn't David
[50:19] he himself that slew the giant it was
[50:23] God through and by David that slew the
[50:26] giant it was what we call Christ and we
[50:29] said that Christ is the Shekinah Glory
[50:31] Christ is God there's no difference uh
[50:34] only just a a a presence or how would
[50:38] you say a manifestation a different
[50:40] manifestation of God but the same God
[50:43] now here in the world we must understand
[50:46] that
[50:48] God is doing a great work and we we we
[50:51] we must yield ourselves to it and I find
[50:55] out that yielding is not so easy but it
[50:58] is what God is requiring us to do see
[51:01] the holy ghost that we're dealing with
[51:03] and and I like to say it like this
[51:05] because you know we understand that the
[51:07] Holy Ghost himself is a person not just
[51:09] a person he is the person he is the
[51:12] Creator and we must understand that the
[51:15] revelation of this creator that we're
[51:18] talking about must not be just in your
[51:20] head it must be in your heart and the
[51:24] only way he's going to get into your
[51:26] heart is that you come through the
[51:27] stages of justification sanctification
[51:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to
[51:32] be a clean vessel in order for God to
[51:35] come and reside in your heart but once
[51:39] he reside in your heart you have now put
[51:42] on the whole armor of God because he is
[51:46] the whole arm of God God David said he's
[51:50] my battle ax Amen in other words he's my
[51:52] he's my warrior he's the one I depend on
[51:55] I don't have to do anything but under
[51:57] his inspiration I can conquer all
[52:01] coming from the message uh uh uh you
[52:04] know Faith by experience the prophet of
[52:06] God says now God knowing that this last
[52:09] day there would come intellectual Giants
[52:12] there would come everything intellectual
[52:15] all kinds of uh all kinds of the enemy
[52:18] with reasoning power to try to prove to
[52:22] the church that the days of Miracles has
[52:24] passed and all this God packed in the
[52:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost with what
[52:30] speak with tongues interpretation of
[52:32] tongues prophecies gifts and all kinds
[52:35] of things they may seem hard in training
[52:38] but brother on the battlefield every one
[52:42] of them has got to be used God equips
[52:46] his Soldier exactly what it takes to use
[52:50] and this is what why we must understand
[52:52] and to whom much is given much is
[52:55] required and we must understand that
[52:57] here we are at a time when it seems like
[53:00] God Things Are not moving but for those
[53:02] of you I I sent a little clip that was
[53:05] sent to me and and it testified of this
[53:07] Pentecostal woman or they call a Holy
[53:10] Roller on this this one thing and this
[53:12] is a recent event uh matter of fact uh
[53:15] brother brother Ben narad sister is
[53:19] related to the sister that prayed and um
[53:22] this lady fell dead in the restaurant
[53:24] and and and and and she had some
[53:27] unbelieving people around calling the
[53:29] lady uh a Holy Roller but and she
[53:33] described these people who long hair
[53:34] long dresses and she said oh they must
[53:37] get ready to have a Holy Roller meeting
[53:39] in there not knowing that same Holy
[53:41] Roller was going to be the one who
[53:43] raised her mom or uh from the dead
[53:46] sister whichever relative it was but the
[53:49] point is God used these women to gather
[53:53] around this sister and one was a
[53:55] physician and they declared her dead and
[53:58] everybody that took her pulse and
[54:00] everything else understood she was dead
[54:02] but God through these sisters raised the
[54:05] dead in our day
[54:08] and so I was really stirred about that
[54:11] because I thought that's exactly what's
[54:14] happening uh when I was in Michigan I
[54:16] experienced the anointing and on a
[54:19] higher level than normal and and then
[54:21] when I went down there uh to uh uh uh uh
[54:25] uh
[54:26] Murfreesboro God did a great work there
[54:29] I mean the same kind of anointing where
[54:32] people would be filled with the Holy
[54:33] Ghost and healed and delivered and it
[54:35] was an awesome service I had nothing to
[54:38] do with it but one thing I want to say
[54:40] for certain he showed up and all I can
[54:45] say is that if we can get the people on
[54:47] One Accord it's amazing what God will do
[54:51] for us
[54:53] he goes on to say in the in in the in
[54:55] the same quote he says oh they might say
[54:57] just learn psychology that that won't
[55:01] work he said no sir that's that's as
[55:04] thin as the broth made out of a shadow
[55:06] of a chicken that's starved to death so
[55:09] that's no good we have to have power of
[55:12] the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with
[55:15] all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in
[55:19] him
[55:20] hallelujah it's not about the church
[55:22] it's about you
[55:24] it's a youth thing individually you and
[55:28] the only way you are going to get this
[55:31] is that you must die out to yourself and
[55:34] rot to your ideas
[55:36] surrendering to God is what we need but
[55:39] you know what the truth of the matter is
[55:40] we think oh what is going to be really
[55:42] if God said we are his wife or he says
[55:45] we are his bride you know we are a woman
[55:49] who is clothed in humility and we accept
[55:52] Jesus Christ as the head
[55:55] of Our Lives
[55:57] Hallelujah he said oh you say I don't I
[56:01] I just don't like to get down there he's
[56:04] talking about prayer I don't like to
[56:06] pray all night I don't like to well then
[56:08] you're going to be killed out on the
[56:11] battlefield you stay there till God
[56:13] equips you with the baptism of the
[56:15] spirit then everything you got need of
[56:18] in this world or the world to come live
[56:21] right in you that's all wise God knows
[56:25] how to equip his army he quips it with
[56:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[56:31] exactly what he sent for these last days
[56:35] that's your equipment and it must go
[56:38] down to the soul this is where the devil
[56:41] is deceiving a lot of people is on the
[56:43] flesh is on the spirit but it has to go
[56:46] down to the soul the Bible says I'm
[56:49] knocking at the door if any man would
[56:52] open up to me he said I will come into
[56:55] him and sub with him that's what God
[56:59] wants to do come all the way into us
[57:03] Hallelujah we can't just stop him at the
[57:05] bed I mean at in the living room we got
[57:07] to take him from there and bring him all
[57:09] the way into the bedroom where the
[57:11] intimacy of God is listen what he says
[57:14] he says now
[57:16] Faith by experience he said the biggest
[57:18] man
[57:19] and the biggest trained man and the more
[57:22] equipped man to fight the man was
[57:24] cowardly brother it doesn't doesn't lay
[57:29] in training it lays in experience and
[57:33] that's the problem a lot of Christians
[57:36] they have never had an experience
[57:39] but you say well what do you mean and
[57:41] when I say that I don't mean you got to
[57:43] feel chills all up your spine I'm not
[57:46] talking about Goosebumps and you know
[57:48] hair standing up on your head I'm just
[57:50] saying the very fact there have been
[57:53] things in your life that you know that
[57:55] you know that only God could have done
[57:57] it
[57:59] Hallelujah so when the Devil comes in
[58:02] like a flood you go back like David did
[58:05] Lord you you you you destroyed the lion
[58:08] you killed the band and so it was
[58:11] training and understand training and
[58:14] every time you go through training even
[58:17] when it comes to boxing when it comes to
[58:19] resting when it comes to football
[58:20] whatever the case may be there is a lot
[58:23] of pain involved
[58:25] but when the real Showdown comes you
[58:29] have been equipped
[58:30] Hallelujah you equipped and you can take
[58:34] the pain Hallelujah to endure the fight
[58:38] and this is what God is doing don't be
[58:40] the Bible said thinking not strange when
[58:42] you fall into diver's Temptation knowing
[58:44] that the trying of your faith is more
[58:46] precious than gold
[58:49] Luke 12 32-34 says fear not little flock
[58:53] for it is your father's good pleasure to
[58:56] give you the kingdom he finds pleasure
[58:58] in giving you the Holy Ghost he finds
[59:02] pleasure in giving you the kingdom but
[59:04] the problem with us we still have this
[59:07] Pentecostal idea that you gotta feel him
[59:11] you don't need to feel him feeling is
[59:14] all good but there's a lot of people who
[59:16] feels the anointing and they're still
[59:18] not filled he said in that day you'll
[59:21] know that I'm in the Father the father's
[59:23] in me and I am in you that's what you
[59:26] need the Revelation that God is in you
[59:29] and when God is in you that Revelation
[59:31] says in you you become an invisible Army
[59:34] you don't mind the training Hallelujah
[59:37] and whatever the trainer tells you to do
[59:40] you'll do it
[59:42] why because it's for your own good
[59:47] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[59:51] is what God would do listen what he says
[59:55] brother welcome says this he said in the
[59:57] greatest battle ever fought
[59:59] 75 paragraph 75 he said if this church
[1:00:02] right now could be put together and
[1:00:06] knitted together with such that every
[1:00:09] person would be on in one Accord
[1:00:13] with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere
[1:00:17] there will not be a feeble person in our
[1:00:21] midst
[1:00:22] in another five minutes
[1:00:24] there would not be a nobody here
[1:00:27] designing the Holy Ghost but what would
[1:00:30] receive it
[1:00:31] if you could just get that certain thing
[1:00:35] fixed now there is where the battle
[1:00:37] begins right in your mind where you
[1:00:41] where where whether you will see what
[1:00:44] he's saying is because people many of
[1:00:47] them they have clocked themselves with
[1:00:49] so much religion they think their
[1:00:51] religion is their power
[1:00:53] but that's no power it's weakness see
[1:00:56] you say well what do you mean because
[1:00:57] Israel had a lot of religion
[1:01:00] but when Goliath came to face them they
[1:01:03] cowered down
[1:01:05] but he was a man who had an experience
[1:01:07] and knew that his anointing was of God
[1:01:11] that's another thing you've got to know
[1:01:13] that your anointing is of God I wish I
[1:01:16] could replay some of the things that
[1:01:18] took place even in in Murfreesboro you
[1:01:22] know as we prayed and and and and I'm
[1:01:24] glorifying God because something
[1:01:27] inspired me to say Lord the anointing
[1:01:30] that's anointing me feel these people
[1:01:32] and God did just that
[1:01:35] it wasn't me
[1:01:37] he anointed me I wish I could replay it
[1:01:40] or or cause it to happen now but it's
[1:01:42] something that he does he's sovereignty
[1:01:47] Hallelujah
[1:01:50] oh God help us here
[1:01:52] because you and I must understand we
[1:01:54] don't have to fear anything
[1:01:56] that's what that's what I've been really
[1:01:58] defeating the devil with because you
[1:02:00] know every one of us have had thoughts
[1:02:02] we've all all made mistakes and you know
[1:02:05] the devil will never let you you you
[1:02:07] forget that but you got to realize that
[1:02:10] when you you you're a new creature
[1:02:14] right not a patched up job so don't let
[1:02:17] him take you down memory lane
[1:02:19] when God Justified you according to this
[1:02:22] message you was justified as though you
[1:02:25] never said in the first place
[1:02:27] so why do you go down that lane when God
[1:02:29] has already Justified you Hallelujah he
[1:02:33] gave you the Holy Ghost when he knew he
[1:02:34] was going to make mistakes
[1:02:36] he know many of us were weird in our own
[1:02:39] way
[1:02:39] and he still gave us the Holy Ghost
[1:02:43] Hallelujah that's not a man's approval
[1:02:45] that's God's approval
[1:02:47] Hallelujah
[1:02:49] glory to God
[1:02:51] yes Lord I'm not going to be long
[1:02:52] tonight but I just wanted to get this
[1:02:55] out listen what he says what's the
[1:02:58] matter
[1:02:59] you had to open the Channel first
[1:03:02] you've got to get the soldier the Holy
[1:03:05] Spirit placed at the Battlefront that
[1:03:09] takes God's word he is the word and he
[1:03:12] stands there there nothing going to stop
[1:03:15] it then there's nothing can every one of
[1:03:20] the uh uh every one of of the other
[1:03:23] channels is cleared out just like a old
[1:03:27] baller with the flu stopped up you got
[1:03:30] you'll put a fire in it'll blow your
[1:03:33] thing up that's what's the matter with
[1:03:36] so many blowed up Christians is it
[1:03:39] because they that they don't clean the
[1:03:41] channels out right they don't go down to
[1:03:45] the inside you got to cleanse it
[1:03:49] conscience memories thoughts laying
[1:03:53] aside everything and coming from the
[1:03:55] inside out with that unadulterated word
[1:03:58] he said that is the truth so you got to
[1:04:02] clean everything you you you you you you
[1:04:05] know you bathe every day but you got to
[1:04:08] go inside of the inside and Only God the
[1:04:12] word can can go down into that depths of
[1:04:15] your soul and tell you what you need to
[1:04:18] repent from
[1:04:19] and people don't do it
[1:04:22] but you got to do it that's your tree in
[1:04:25] order to be fit for the battle you
[1:04:27] listen the part that I love about Jesus
[1:04:30] before he was crucified he said I know
[1:04:33] Satan's coming
[1:04:34] but Satan has no part of me and above
[1:04:38] otherwise he says there is no darkness
[1:04:40] in me and this is where God is trying to
[1:04:43] get us so that Satan won't have anything
[1:04:45] in you to pull on
[1:04:47] Hallelujah and I'm pressing toward the
[1:04:50] mark
[1:04:51] depressing every day I'm pressing I win
[1:04:55] some and I lose some but you see what
[1:04:57] I've got to go I have a Mark I know
[1:05:00] where I'm headed
[1:05:02] Hallelujah and you know what I don't
[1:05:04] have to worry about it
[1:05:06] because he won the victory
[1:05:09] and my victory is in him and because he
[1:05:12] won the victory I win
[1:05:14] Hallelujah
[1:05:16] we are new creatures that right
[1:05:18] but the Bible says once you get that
[1:05:20] faith in you once you get Christ and you
[1:05:22] the way you where you are he said you're
[1:05:24] like a solar system
[1:05:26] he said the moon the stars and none of
[1:05:28] them moves out of place everything moves
[1:05:31] and everything does exactly what it's
[1:05:33] supposed to do it's solid Hallelujah
[1:05:35] basically that's what he's saying once
[1:05:37] you get everything in place you become a
[1:05:41] solid Christian and Satan can't move you
[1:05:44] at all
[1:05:45] Hallelujah I'll read that to you about I
[1:05:49] did something to my little thing back
[1:05:51] there but he says now what you got then
[1:05:53] he said you've got a solar system
[1:05:55] Hallelujah if you get the stars in order
[1:05:58] and says hang there till I call you
[1:06:01] they they they
[1:06:03] stay there see nothing's going to move
[1:06:06] them when when God can get a man in his
[1:06:10] hand till he can get senses conscience
[1:06:14] everything cleaned out until it stands
[1:06:17] with God behind it in the spirit there's
[1:06:20] not a devil in the world can poke a
[1:06:22] doubt in there he said that's right and
[1:06:25] the problem is we these eyes become lion
[1:06:28] eyes
[1:06:30] if God said with his stripes we healed
[1:06:32] that's exactly what he says that's what
[1:06:35] he means amen he had to teach Mary and
[1:06:39] Martha he had to teach them your eyes
[1:06:41] don't mean nothing circumstances mean
[1:06:44] nothing man should not live by bread
[1:06:46] alone but by every word of God every
[1:06:49] word that proceed out of the mouth of
[1:06:50] God he said if you believe it he said
[1:06:52] I'm gonna give you a test why don't you
[1:06:54] roll away that stone and they did and
[1:06:57] that stone was a type of unbelief
[1:06:59] Hallelujah they rolled it away and Jesus
[1:07:03] said now this day you're going to see
[1:07:04] the resurrection huh what did he say he
[1:07:07] didn't say uh you know I've got
[1:07:09] something over here to press a button he
[1:07:11] didn't use no kind of psychology you
[1:07:13] know what he said he said I am the
[1:07:16] resurrection and I am the life
[1:07:19] Hallelujah and they were able to see the
[1:07:22] resurrection in motion Hallelujah
[1:07:25] because when he called for Lazarus
[1:07:27] Lazarus got up oh I can't imagine what
[1:07:31] that must have been like but he got up a
[1:07:33] man that had been dead for days
[1:07:36] stinking but God in a moment's time
[1:07:40] brought every piece of his flesh Back
[1:07:42] Together made him brand new
[1:07:45] Hallelujah just like I was telling the
[1:07:47] sister down there she was talking about
[1:07:49] her condition I said well you ain't as
[1:07:51] bad as Lazarus was
[1:07:54] now if God can raise up Lazarus from the
[1:07:57] dead he can heal your disease
[1:07:59] he can cure it what is that Hallelujah
[1:08:02] these things are nothing but a drop in
[1:08:04] the bucket hallelujah we're like a grain
[1:08:06] of sand
[1:08:08] he's holding the moon holding the stars
[1:08:10] all of them none of them moving out of
[1:08:12] place because his word told them to stay
[1:08:15] there and so when we understand his word
[1:08:18] and the power of His word you just stay
[1:08:20] there speak it believe it stay there and
[1:08:24] watch it unfold because that's what
[1:08:26] Jesus did in creation he spoke it and
[1:08:29] stood back and watched it unfold he
[1:08:32] didn't waver we don't know how long it
[1:08:34] took to bring it to pass but he stayed
[1:08:37] there and he kept saying it's good it's
[1:08:39] good it's good and that's exactly what
[1:08:42] we must learn to do
[1:08:44] if we're going to be like him we must
[1:08:46] speak like him
[1:08:48] and there was not one word of Doubt ever
[1:08:51] coming out of his mouth
[1:08:53] Hallelujah
[1:08:55] he said a man can't even come see
[1:08:57] Hallelujah here it is a man cannot sin
[1:09:00] until first he cast aside God's word
[1:09:06] that's unbelief
[1:09:08] that's what sin is that's in the battle
[1:09:10] huh we can't do it oh God let this
[1:09:13] happen no no no no no we must come to a
[1:09:16] place as no I don't care what it looks
[1:09:19] like can you imagine how Moses was when
[1:09:22] he stood there at the Red Sea and God
[1:09:25] said telling him to stake out your rod
[1:09:27] and speak to it or whatever Durant see
[1:09:30] what kind of Faith see what we must
[1:09:33] understand it wasn't Moses faith it was
[1:09:35] God's faith it was Christ on the scene
[1:09:38] that's what we call the Shekinah Glory
[1:09:40] it was God on this that's what we want
[1:09:43] with us not sometimes all the time this
[1:09:47] is what we're striving for this is what
[1:09:49] we're pressing for every day we must die
[1:09:52] we must search our conscience we must
[1:09:54] search our Spirits our thinking our
[1:09:57] everything Lord show me have I looked at
[1:10:00] something have I done something have I
[1:10:02] thought something whatever it is cleanse
[1:10:04] me oh God
[1:10:06] constantly we got a must do we must do
[1:10:08] that
[1:10:10] Hallelujah don't feel bad you're not the
[1:10:13] only one all of us has to do this daily
[1:10:15] we should if we're going to move forward
[1:10:17] we must do this daily if we want God to
[1:10:21] come down and cap us off the way he's
[1:10:24] perfect you know to do listen he we are
[1:10:28] in training right now
[1:10:30] and many of us are failing because we're
[1:10:33] not doing just what I said cleansing
[1:10:36] ourselves on a daily basis
[1:10:39] foreign
[1:10:40] see the battle is not tomorrow the
[1:10:42] battle is now this is amateur now this
[1:10:45] is amateur

[1:10:51] people battle devils and at the same
[1:10:53] time you got to love them

[1:11:08] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:11:10] do
[1:11:12] that's why we have the battles people is
[1:11:15] to perfect us it's to grow Us in
[1:11:18] character
[1:11:19] oh we all got a right to be what we want
[1:11:22] to be and do what we want to do but
[1:11:24] that's not what we're here for we came
[1:11:26] to be what he want us to be
[1:11:28] and we're living in that time when
[1:11:31] culture and education and things have
[1:11:33] smothered over the word of God and got
[1:11:36] into reasoning and so forth the Battle
[1:11:39] Is Now who will stand Hallelujah the
[1:11:44] battle is ready to go in she's arrayed
[1:11:47] now look what a great opposition we've
[1:11:50] got Yonder who will be like David said
[1:11:53] you stand and let that uncircumcised
[1:11:56] Philistine defy the armies of the Living
[1:11:59] God I'll go fight him
[1:12:02] hallelujah how are you going to fight
[1:12:05] him down on your knees
[1:12:07] you got to pray and hold God and don't
[1:12:10] let him go

[1:12:15] Jacob did hold him don't let him go Lord
[1:12:18] you promised Lord you promised Lord you
[1:12:21] promise don't let him go and you got to
[1:12:23] come to a place where you where no
[1:12:25] cannot be an answer
[1:12:32] five star general that's what he is
[1:12:36] five-star bride faith and Grace and
[1:12:39] Jesus see nothing can be done without
[1:12:41] him the Holy Ghost see started the
[1:12:45] church by giving them power and
[1:12:47] authority
[1:12:48] that's exactly right and you've heard me
[1:12:50] say this I am Divine and you the
[1:12:52] branches right yeah yeah he that abideth
[1:12:55] in me and I in him the same bringeth
[1:12:57] forth much fruit for without
[1:13:00] me you can do nothing and that means
[1:13:02] abide
[1:13:04] abide
[1:13:06] that don't doesn't mean go in and out it
[1:13:08] means abide
[1:13:09] stay there right amen and that's where
[1:13:13] God wants us to be not in the outer
[1:13:16] Court
[1:13:17] not in the in the inner Court he wants
[1:13:20] it right in that Shekinah because that's
[1:13:23] where we belong
[1:13:25] that's him and her if I can say it like
[1:13:29] that that's God masculine
[1:13:32] excuse me and feminine there on the
[1:13:35] throne is that what he promised if you
[1:13:37] overcome I will grant with you to sit
[1:13:40] with me in my throne even as I have sat
[1:13:43] in my father's throne
[1:13:46] um
[1:13:47] that's his that's is what he's saying
[1:13:51] see and and and you say well
[1:13:55] he thought it not Robert to be equal to
[1:13:57] God we can't even bring ourselves to
[1:13:59] believe that we are and let me tell you
[1:14:01] something it's not you
[1:14:03] he ain't talking about the Flesh of you
[1:14:05] he's talking about the God in you
[1:14:08] right when I go to the store and I get a
[1:14:10] bottle of cocoa Coke a Coca-Cola you
[1:14:13] know it ain't the bottle I'm in love
[1:14:14] with
[1:14:15] it's a substance
[1:14:18] right more than likely you're gonna
[1:14:20] throw the bottle away once the substance
[1:14:21] is drained so that's how it is it's
[1:14:23] what's in you the Bible is not a Coke
[1:14:26] it's the substance in the bottle that's
[1:14:28] the coke
[1:14:29] oh help us Jesus right see our minds is
[1:14:32] the channel That Satan is working in he
[1:14:35] is trying to convince us that we are
[1:14:38] alone and that the Lord is not with us
[1:14:40] and of course we know that's a lie right
[1:14:43] he has always been a liar the truth is
[1:14:46] where where where God has made us God
[1:14:50] and children of God and and we need to
[1:14:52] start accepting that not just in our
[1:14:54] head when the Trials come you must begin
[1:14:57] to realize who you are that's the
[1:15:00] difference between David the anointing
[1:15:03] that David had made him recognize even
[1:15:05] though he was a boy he had been chosen
[1:15:08] by God selected by God and he was a king
[1:15:14] yeah we we go around like poppers you
[1:15:16] know like oh Lord you know Lord I need a
[1:15:19] little bit more of this and that no no
[1:15:21] no no no God then gave us all we need
[1:15:23] we need to enter into it right he said
[1:15:26] the true church the True Believer the
[1:15:28] body of Believers has access to food
[1:15:31] spiritual food that the nominals knows
[1:15:35] nothing about the world knows nothing of
[1:15:38] this food
[1:15:39] father but your church your people the
[1:15:42] Bride of your son loves it and that's
[1:15:46] the thing and we must understand that's
[1:15:47] why you know people
[1:15:49] let me say it like this if you're not
[1:15:52] eating on the word every day
[1:15:55] you're going to come up and anemic
[1:15:59] you can't come up lacking
[1:16:02] every day you need to at least read the
[1:16:05] Bible or listen to a tape or some
[1:16:09] something to get you going of course you
[1:16:12] got to pray right it's all part of it
[1:16:15] you're in training and you need
[1:16:18] instructions now what is it that a sheep
[1:16:21] has come to the place he can't hear the
[1:16:24] shepherd's voice
[1:16:26] he started wandering off and doing
[1:16:28] things and what happens the shepherd
[1:16:31] finds him and does what he breaks his
[1:16:33] leg
[1:16:34] so that he can have control over the
[1:16:37] Sheep
[1:16:38] and you don't want God to break your leg
[1:16:42] y'all don't matter you know I'm hoarse
[1:16:44] so it's okay
[1:16:45] but you know the truth of the matter is
[1:16:46] we'll come to a place amen we must
[1:16:48] realize we're in a battle this is not a
[1:16:52] picnic you know we really don't have
[1:16:54] time for a lot of the stuff everything
[1:16:56] is distractions
[1:17:01] hmm I love it the way the prophet brings
[1:17:04] it out he said the Christ in Ezekiel
[1:17:07] Christ and Moses Christ and David Christ
[1:17:10] and Jesus the same yesterday today and
[1:17:12] forever what the word being made
[1:17:15] manifest by these prophets but it
[1:17:17] doesn't stop there it's Christ in you
[1:17:19] Paul says it Christ in you the hope of
[1:17:23] glory
[1:17:24] Christ in you what Glory the glory of
[1:17:28] being a son of undaughter of God
[1:17:33] that's the glory
[1:17:40] he said we notice here again if the word
[1:17:43] is in us and has come to
