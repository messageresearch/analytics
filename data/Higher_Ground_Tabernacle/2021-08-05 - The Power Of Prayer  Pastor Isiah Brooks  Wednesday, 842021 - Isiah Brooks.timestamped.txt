[21:18] amen um
[21:22] we just have a few announcements before
[21:24] we continue with the song
[21:26] so um we have a reminder of the
[21:31] family camp that's happening in michigan
[21:34] that is going to be the weekend of the
[21:39] um running from
[21:42] thursday the 12th till sunday the 15th
[21:46] that's that weekend in michigan
[21:48] so those who are still willing to go
[21:50] still open
[21:51] you can talk to brother isaiah and hear
[21:54] more of the
[21:56] details and then
[21:58] the following two weekends or the
[22:01] following three weekends
[22:02] which is the 29th of august
[22:05] these are special meetings in iowa city
[22:09] that's going to be on the saturday of
[22:10] the 28th and
[22:12] the sunday the 29th so on the sunday the
[22:16] 29th we are not going to have
[22:17] a service here in des moines we are all
[22:22] supposed to go and support our brothers
[22:25] so we can fellowship together in unity
[22:28] the bible says behold how good and how
[22:30] pleasant it is
[22:31] for the brethren to dwell in unity so i
[22:34] believe it will be a wonderful
[22:35] time of fellowship in the presence of
[22:37] the almighty god
[22:38] that will be um the church's fifth
[22:42] uh church anniversary so they'll be
[22:44] having brother ben and rod
[22:46] coming down for the special meeting so
[22:48] the saints from here in des moines
[22:50] it will be good for us to go down the in
[22:53] fellowship with
[22:55] them saying amen so let's just keep the
[22:58] series of meetings that's laying ahead
[23:00] of us
[23:00] in prayer amen let us sing this song
[23:04] as the deer painted for the water you
[23:07] know i started seeing
[23:08] this scripture differently
[23:11] when i realized that it's just not
[23:13] thirst the tea is just not rushing to
[23:15] the water for thirst
[23:16] but when it is hurt it runs through the
[23:19] water because that's where he knows
[23:21] he's going to get his salvation it knows
[23:24] that's when he's going to get healed
[23:26] after it's been ravaged by those wild
[23:28] dogs and everything
[23:30] it runs so there's a different kind of
[23:34] thirst
[23:34] because it's a life-saving thirst so if
[23:38] we have that kind of thirst knowing that
[23:41] whatever has touched you
[23:43] whatever has harmed you if you run to
[23:46] christ
[23:46] is that living waters that can save you
[23:49] amen

[24:07] the water so my soul

[36:37] heard from my brother keith today he's
[36:40] taking a little rest
[36:41] some things uh he had to deal with
[36:43] physically so
[36:45] nothing major but it was necessary that
[36:50] he

[36:54] recuperate from
[36:56] i guess the battle that he's now going
[36:58] through of course we know victory is
[37:00] ours
[37:01] and uh we thank the lord for that i'm
[37:03] just going to preach on a real simple
[37:05] subject tonight
[37:06] the power of prayer and uh we're going
[37:09] to ask that you turn with us to matthew
[37:11] the sixth chapter
[37:13] and then we're going to also preach
[37:15] excuse me on
[37:16] ephesians 1 1-6
[37:19] amen the lord is surely good to us
[37:23] matthew 6.
[37:35] uh we're going to um
[37:39] uh take the scripture according to
[37:41] matthew 6 and it's always good to see
[37:43] brother abraham amen the father of faith
[37:48] amen we always uh say to our children
[37:52] one day those names going to kick in
[37:56] god has a purpose for naming us what who
[37:58] and what he names us
[37:59] amen so matthew 6 1-11
[38:04] take heed that you do not your arms
[38:07] before men
[38:08] to be seen of them otherwise you have no
[38:11] reward of your father which is in heaven
[38:14] therefore when thou doeth thine arms do
[38:17] not sound a trumpet before the
[38:19] as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
[38:22] and in the streets
[38:23] that they may have glory of men verily
[38:26] i say unto you they have their reward
[38:30] but when thou doeth arm let not thy left
[38:33] hand
[38:34] know what thy right hand doeth the dying
[38:37] arms may be in secret
[38:39] and the father which seeth in secret
[38:41] himself shall reward thee
[38:43] openly and when thou prayeth
[38:46] thou shall not be as the hypocrites are
[38:50] for they love to pray standing in the
[38:52] synagogues
[38:53] and in the corners of the streets that
[38:55] they may be seen
[38:56] of men verily i say unto you
[39:00] they have their reward but thou
[39:03] when thou prayeth enter into thy closet
[39:06] when thou has shut thy door pray
[39:09] to thy father which is in secret and the
[39:13] father which
[39:14] seeth thee and shall in secret shall
[39:17] reward thee
[39:18] openly
[39:22] hallelujah let us pray
[39:26] i'm sorry let's go to ephesians 1. just
[39:28] that quick
[39:30] ephesians 1.
[39:33] hallelujah thank the lord for his
[39:36] goodness and his grace and
[39:38] surely god has been good to us ephesians
[39:40] 1 we're going to begin at the first
[39:42] verse there
[39:45] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[39:48] will of god to the saints which
[39:50] are at ephesus and to the faithful
[39:54] in christ jesus grace be to you
[39:58] in peace from god our father and from
[40:00] the lord
[40:01] jesus christ blessed be the father
[40:04] excuse me blessed be the god and father
[40:06] of our lord jesus christ
[40:07] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[40:10] blessings in heavenly places
[40:12] in christ according he has chosen us in
[40:15] him
[40:16] before the foundation of the world and
[40:18] that we should be
[40:19] holy and without blame before him in
[40:21] love
[40:22] having predestinated us unto the
[40:24] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[40:26] himself
[40:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[40:29] will to the praise of the glory of his
[40:32] grace
[40:33] wherein he have made us accepted in the
[40:36] beloved let us pray
[40:40] our dear heavenly father we thank you
[40:42] for your amazing grace
[40:44] we thank you for being so good to us
[40:46] lord and we thank you lord for keeping
[40:48] giving us what we stand in need of daily
[40:51] lord
[40:52] father you are awesome there is no god
[40:54] like you
[40:55] and we thank you father for choosing to
[40:58] share your eternal life with us
[41:02] truly we are unworthy creatures but we
[41:05] thank you for you
[41:06] not only being our maker our creator but
[41:09] also
[41:10] our salvation and we thank you father
[41:13] tonight
[41:14] bless the service in a special way as we
[41:16] commit the service into your hands in
[41:18] jesus christ's name we pray
[41:20] amen you may be seated
[41:25] this might seem like a simple subject
[41:27] but you know when it comes to prayer
[41:31] a lot of christians have problems
[41:33] praying
[41:38] it truly is not a difficult thing
[41:42] but we make it difficult prayer comes as
[41:45] easy as it is to communicating with
[41:47] human beings
[41:49] we talk to them they talk to us
[41:53] we call that communion we fellowship and
[41:55] sometimes we
[41:56] share our most intimate secrets with
[41:59] what we call friends
[42:02] prayer in itself when it comes to
[42:06] the new testament you'll find out that
[42:09] in the old testament you didn't find too
[42:11] many people praying
[42:14] the only time that they would pray was
[42:16] most of the time when they were in a
[42:18] desperate need when something was going
[42:21] wrong
[42:22] because you got to realize throughout
[42:24] the history of the jewish people
[42:26] they put all the prayer on the priest
[42:32] kind of like what people do to preachers
[42:34] now pray for me
[42:37] but we find out that it had become such
[42:39] a tradition
[42:41] uh among the jewish people they didn't
[42:43] even know how to pray
[42:46] and if you can follow me by god's grace
[42:49] you'll find out that
[42:52] prayer became traditional
[42:56] you know uh bringing it to
[43:00] to the jewish people you'll find out
[43:02] that they thought that god was only in
[43:04] that building
[43:06] and of course when they brought in the
[43:08] sacrifice you know the priest was there
[43:10] to pray for them and
[43:11] and you know do all of the you know
[43:13] works of it
[43:14] all the incense that represented prayer
[43:18] they symbolically would wave it over the
[43:20] people and wave it everywhere
[43:22] and so every time they had a need they
[43:26] would go to the priest
[43:29] but there were times when they didn't
[43:30] have a priest to go to
[43:33] and it was really god using those
[43:36] situations to show that
[43:38] prayer could be prayed anywhere
[43:42] sometimes people love praying standing
[43:44] sometimes they love
[43:45] praying kneeling sometimes they love
[43:47] praying walking
[43:49] sometimes people sing in prayer
[43:50] sometimes they you know like david he's
[43:52] song in prayer
[43:55] yeah thanksgiving and all of that and we
[43:58] realize by god's grace amen that prayer
[44:01] is in order for god to heal you it must
[44:04] be
[44:05] sincere he's not particularly care he's
[44:09] not
[44:10] particularly caring about how long you
[44:12] make it
[44:13] he wants you to be direct specific
[44:16] and he also wants you to have faith
[44:20] in your prayer and that he will answer
[44:22] your prayer
[44:24] when we talk about abiding in faith
[44:27] it means to continue without change so
[44:30] when you ask god for anything you can't
[44:32] go back and forth no matter how the
[44:35] conditions changes
[44:36] you must stand steadfast
[44:40] and so prayer like i said is is
[44:43] communing with god that's the whole
[44:44] point behind prayer
[44:46] is to share intimacy of intimate things
[44:49] or intimate
[44:50] thoughts or feelings with god and that's
[44:53] what we call
[44:54] communion communing with god is that all
[44:57] right
[44:58] as i said when it comes to prayer it's
[45:00] not the condition or the position you
[45:02] stand on kneeling
[45:04] is actually the condition of the heart
[45:07] this is what god
[45:08] looks at and some so sometimes when we
[45:11] we pray and and we've gotten into
[45:13] traditional things
[45:15] sometimes we get to praying and we gotta
[45:17] almost pray a sermon
[45:18] god is not interested in that
[45:21] and one thing for certain we forget that
[45:23] god already knows
[45:25] what you have need of
[45:28] and so we must realize amen by god's
[45:30] grace amen i don't think i finished
[45:33] matthew but anyway
[45:34] matthew 1 uh 1-11 we're going to we're
[45:37] going to go through that let's go back
[45:38] there
[45:39] because i don't want the devil to steal
[45:40] nothing from me
[45:42] all right that was matthew 6
[45:45] and we again we began to to to read part
[45:48] of it but we didn't
[45:49] finish it all
[45:53] and we stopped at the fifth verse
[45:56] right that god once you go into your
[45:58] closet god will come around
[46:00] and i'm sorry
[46:04] fourth verse let's start at the fifth
[46:06] and without praise
[46:07] thou shall not be as hypocrites are
[46:10] for they love to pray standing in the
[46:12] synagogues and in the in the corner of
[46:15] the street
[46:16] that they may be seen of men verily i
[46:19] say unto you
[46:20] they have their reward and oftentimes we
[46:24] find even in the christian
[46:25] we find that people pray like that you
[46:27] know
[46:28] most churches you know your preachers
[46:31] almost have to tell them
[46:32] that's not necessary pray direct
[46:36] it doesn't take 30 minutes 15 minutes 20
[46:38] minutes to do what you got to do
[46:40] pray direct because that's what god is
[46:42] expecting
[46:44] right we're not here to be seen of men
[46:47] we we want god to hear our prayer and
[46:50] this is what
[46:51] you know it's just something that people
[46:53] do and they it makes them look
[46:54] spiritual i don't know whether they
[46:56] intentionally do it
[46:58] but but they do it but the proper way of
[47:01] praying is first to acknowledge god
[47:06] and the bible said he that cometh to god
[47:08] must first believe that he
[47:09] is and that he is a reward of them that
[47:12] did until they seek him
[47:14] i was looking uh just the other day and
[47:16] just in awe
[47:17] and i'm thinking how great god is and
[47:21] he's so great i can't even comprehend
[47:23] them and i look at the stars and i look
[47:25] at the moon and i look at the sun
[47:27] and since i've been born every you know
[47:30] they're still in the same place doing
[47:31] the same thing
[47:33] and i've changed but they have not
[47:37] they still doing the same thing that
[47:38] they uh were created and purposed to do
[47:42] and i think about god how can anybody
[47:44] think that there is no god when things
[47:46] are so great around us
[47:48] you know what we can't heal nothing you
[47:51] know i mean we can't even deliver
[47:52] ourselves
[47:54] right everything is in the hands of god
[47:56] we used to sing that song
[47:58] everything's moving by the power of god
[48:00] and that's true
[48:02] i mean we see the chaos of of our
[48:06] country our nation and not just here all
[48:08] over the world
[48:10] guess what everything's moving by the
[48:12] power of god
[48:14] the word of god has spoken these things
[48:16] and they must come to pass
[48:18] you know what it is we must find our
[48:21] purpose where we
[48:22] where we stand and what we should be
[48:24] doing in this hour
[48:26] and often time that comes by prayer
[48:30] right because you remember even in
[48:32] daniel's time daniel began to pray and
[48:34] read the scrolls
[48:36] and by doing so he came to know his day
[48:39] this was my time to exit but oftentimes
[48:43] people don't know who they're praying to
[48:45] it's true you know they they don't they
[48:48] they say they're praying to god but they
[48:49] don't even know god
[48:50] they don't know who god is right and how
[48:54] can you com
[48:54] pray to him if you don't know who he is
[48:56] he's more like an idol to you
[48:59] but our god is a living god
[49:02] in acts 17 23 it says for as i
[49:06] passed by and beheld your devotion
[49:09] i found an altar with this inscription
[49:12] to the unknown god whom therefore ye
[49:16] ignorantly worship him declare
[49:19] i unto you see and you got to understand
[49:22] these people
[49:23] amen was so superstitious
[49:27] because remember in the 22nd verse paul
[49:30] says i perceive
[49:32] that ye that in all things you are
[49:34] superstitious
[49:36] you know and people find that you know
[49:38] they like that in the in
[49:39] you know you dream of dreaming you know
[49:41] what i mean or you see something that
[49:44] everything must be brought back to the
[49:45] word there's nothing wrong with dreams
[49:48] but sometimes people think that dreams
[49:50] they take their life
[49:51] you know direct their lives and in some
[49:54] cases they do
[49:55] but not in all cases everything must
[49:57] come back to the word of god
[49:59] right some people are so superstitious
[50:02] even in
[50:02] christians you know they're afraid of
[50:04] the black cat and you know don't step on
[50:06] my foot
[50:07] and you know all that kind of nonsense
[50:09] but
[50:10] they do it and and it's all because
[50:13] it's a an excessive fear
[50:17] uh that they have of gods like god is is
[50:20] here to destroy you
[50:22] he's going to judge you and he's going
[50:23] to kill you and he's going to send you
[50:25] to hell
[50:26] amen and you don't even know him see but
[50:29] let me say
[50:29] one thing about god my god gives every
[50:32] opportunity
[50:33] to every man to know him
[50:36] hallelujah and god never sends a man to
[50:39] hell
[50:40] man sends himself there by refusing
[50:43] uh what god's plan is
[50:47] you know we we you know sometimes you
[50:50] you
[50:50] hear people pray pray and of course we
[50:53] don't we don't have that here i don't
[50:55] believe but
[50:55] you know you have to almost go get a
[50:57] dictionary to understand the words that
[50:59] they're talking about
[51:00] and of course as if god is like that
[51:05] god is not like that and we're going to
[51:07] get there in just a moment god is simple
[51:10] right he gave us a simple language
[51:12] called english
[51:13] and we can talk to god like help me lord
[51:16] that's prayer
[51:18] when it's a sincere heart like i said
[51:20] prayer is communication
[51:22] to god you know prayer uh
[51:25] done by those who trust the power of the
[51:28] word and thought
[51:30] see you can't you pray to god and you
[51:32] don't trust his word you might as well
[51:33] forget it
[51:35] right you got to understand that you got
[51:37] to pray and your prayer must be
[51:39] according to the word
[51:40] and you must trust him
[51:44] right when jesus taught this to people
[51:46] because
[51:47] just to show you how corrupt prayer was
[51:49] and i read you the scripture
[51:51] how corrupt it was in that day when the
[51:53] pharisees or sadducees whoever they were
[51:56] in the marketplace they would pray oh
[51:58] lord this that
[52:00] and i'm gonna go to another scripture
[52:01] there in saint luke where the man says
[52:02] lord you know i've been this and i've
[52:04] been dead i mean
[52:05] and god said which one came out
[52:08] justified
[52:09] the man who smoked his breast is the
[52:12] lord i'm not even worthy to call upon
[52:14] your name
[52:15] see in order to pray to god my god
[52:18] you got to first know what he is and who
[52:20] he is let me tell you who he is
[52:22] he's god of all things
[52:26] he's the creator of all things amen he's
[52:28] the only potentate
[52:30] y'all understand me he's the king of
[52:33] kings
[52:34] and if you go back into revelation
[52:35] you'll find out the other kings had to
[52:38] bow to this king
[52:39] amen and that's what we are we must
[52:41] understand
[52:42] in order to approach god we must learn
[52:45] how to
[52:45] we must learn how to be clothed in
[52:48] humility
[52:51] god don't owe any of us anything amen
[52:54] you know i
[52:54] you know i hate to hear people say well
[52:56] god is not fair hallelujah
[52:58] who made you judge of god
[53:00] [Music]
[53:01] we ought to be so grateful amen that god
[53:03] has given us
[53:04] life i'm so glad god didn't make me a
[53:07] dog
[53:08] or a cat or a rat or a roach
[53:12] you understand me god made us in his
[53:15] image and his likeness
[53:17] that alone he deserved praise
[53:22] look at it jesus taught the people to
[53:24] say what
[53:25] uh the lord's prayer
[53:28] and and you say well what do you mean
[53:30] brother brooks listen
[53:33] like i said prayer is is is
[53:36] uh how can i say it it it composes
[53:40] of four things i know for certain
[53:44] adoration contribution
[53:50] thanksgiving and supplication
[53:55] you know what he says what do you mean
[53:56] brother books well uh when his disciples
[53:59] asked him how to pray he told him how to
[54:01] pray
[54:02] amen now we don't have to say that
[54:04] prayer verbatim but he showed us the
[54:06] order in which we should pray
[54:09] and a lot of times we go to god and says
[54:11] lord you know i need this i need that i
[54:13] need that and
[54:14] you're approaching a king even the
[54:17] natural man knows how to approach a king
[54:20] you're not going to approach a king and
[54:21] get some kind of results
[54:23] from that king if you don't come with
[54:25] the world right protocol
[54:27] first of all you've got to come with
[54:29] adoration you've got to tell the king
[54:31] how great he
[54:32] is and what he's done for the kingdom
[54:35] and what he's done for you
[54:37] hallelujah right you gotta let him know
[54:40] you
[54:41] re you recognize who he is oh come on
[54:44] you know i think it was abigail when you
[54:47] know her husband was the fool
[54:50] right and when she saw
[54:53] david she knew david was coming
[54:56] she didn't she didn't remain in her rags
[54:59] she went
[54:59] and changed her clothes i called them
[55:02] the garments of praise
[55:03] she went and changed her clothes came
[55:06] back
[55:08] and she she got all of the tithing all
[55:10] of the everything she can grab
[55:12] get it all and she met david and the
[55:15] first thing she
[55:17] she began to do was worship david he
[55:19] praised him
[55:21] she adored him she gave him alteration
[55:24] and
[55:24] and you know she confessed forgive my
[55:27] husband he's
[55:28] his his name is neighbor and that name
[55:30] means food
[55:31] right she she humbled herself in
[55:34] humility
[55:36] right because she knew david had a right
[55:39] to kill him
[55:40] and he had a temper here he had
[55:43] protected their land and everything else
[55:45] all those years
[55:46] now you got to understand folks david
[55:49] typed out god
[55:51] amen is that right somebody told me
[55:54] a little thing the other day and i
[55:56] thought that's awesome what if a man
[55:58] come to you
[55:59] and he says listen i have a job i i i
[56:02] want you to do
[56:03] i'm going to provide this job i'm going
[56:05] to provide the uniform the strength the
[56:07] days whatever
[56:08] i'm going to give it all to you and you
[56:10] know when when it's time to collect the
[56:12] money
[56:13] just give me 10 percent
[56:16] you can have the rest now i don't know
[56:19] nobody in here
[56:21] who wouldn't say i do it and that's
[56:24] exactly what god does
[56:26] he gives you strength he gives you the
[56:28] ability to work
[56:29] he gives you the hours to work he gives
[56:32] you everything
[56:33] and all he asks for when your check come
[56:36] is ten percent
[56:38] amen and we want to hold back on god huh
[56:42] come on what do you think the judgment
[56:44] will be
[56:45] when god sees that you have held back
[56:47] the ten percent
[56:50] help us jesus
[56:54] but god is good to us isn't it
[56:58] yes even you know like i said there are
[57:00] christians who do not even know who
[57:02] who they pray to just like that unknown
[57:05] god you'll be
[57:06] it's amazing how many christians say
[57:08] they worship jesus christ and yet jesus
[57:10] christ is still
[57:11] unknown because let me tell you
[57:13] something the only way that you can know
[57:15] him
[57:15] is to know his word amen he's known by
[57:19] his word
[57:19] his character everything he he is is in
[57:23] this word
[57:24] amen you don't read his word you don't
[57:26] know his word
[57:27] you don't read and study his word you
[57:29] have no intimacy
[57:31] amen hallelujah is that right because he
[57:34] told it
[57:35] uh even israel meditate on it
[57:38] meditate on the word when in other words
[57:40] keep it in your heart and your mind so
[57:43] it will be quickened into you right so
[57:46] you understand what i'm saying
[57:48] that's why practicing christianity is
[57:51] doesn't work if the word of god doesn't
[57:54] quicken in you
[57:55] to take control of you to make you do it
[57:59] it's basically vain it's the word that
[58:02] lives not you
[58:03] paul said it is not i that live but
[58:05] christ that lives in me
[58:08] so when christ lives in you that the
[58:10] word is active
[58:12] in you and it's subduing all of your
[58:15] enemies
[58:17] hallelujah let's turn to saint luke
[58:20] please 11 11-1
[58:23] prayer is not difficult we make it
[58:25] difficult enter into your closet
[58:28] now some of us don't have a big enough
[58:29] closet but regardless reality he says
[58:32] enter here you understand me because a
[58:36] lot of times we think god is here he's
[58:38] in heaven
[58:38] the word of god says no no no he's not
[58:41] thee
[58:43] he's even in you he's now you even in
[58:46] your mouth
[58:47] we are the temple of god we are the
[58:50] temple of god
[58:52] and god is not far from us that we can't
[58:54] reach him or talk to him
[58:55] we don't have to have a 9-1-1 line
[58:58] you and i become one with god right
[59:02] now i'll say it like this even when
[59:04] jesus wasn't it was in the garden of
[59:06] gethsemane you think god was in heaven
[59:10] looking down at him like oh my poor boy
[59:13] he was
[59:13] in him
[59:18] man no flesh could have done what he did
[59:24] you understand what i'm saying the
[59:26] crucifixion in itself
[59:28] yeah there was a time that god left him
[59:32] but he left him amen when jesus said oh
[59:37] my god my god why is thou forsaken me
[59:40] now we don't know exactly when he left
[59:43] but when he became sin
[59:46] god had to depart you understand what
[59:49] i'm saying
[59:50] not not like we think the party is
[59:55] but that's the problem god said jesus
[59:57] took calvary as a man so we got to
[1:00:00] understand but he prayed
[1:00:02] you understand me he prayed and the
[1:00:05] bible said he prayed vehemently
[1:00:07] so much so amen the sweat of his brow
[1:00:10] became like drops of blood
[1:00:13] you know what i mean now he taught his
[1:00:15] disciples how to pray
[1:00:17] but do you think he was quoting our
[1:00:19] father who was in heaven
[1:00:20] no no no no he was direct he no no doubt
[1:00:24] what he was saying
[1:00:25] he knew the beating he was going to get
[1:00:27] he knew the
[1:00:29] heart the things that were going to take
[1:00:30] place and no doubt he directed those
[1:00:32] things at god
[1:00:34] he as a man talked to god
[1:00:37] directly and told god whatever he told
[1:00:40] him
[1:00:42] one thing he said lord let this cup pass
[1:00:44] for me he did not want to do it
[1:00:47] but the bible said at a point in time
[1:00:50] an angel came and strengthened him
[1:00:55] by way of prayer god never lets you
[1:00:58] fight the battle alone
[1:01:00] hallelujah you stay in god god will stay
[1:01:03] in you
[1:01:04] abide with me and let my word abide in
[1:01:07] you
[1:01:08] right amen we'll get there in a moment
[1:01:11] right let's go to saint luke the 11th
[1:01:14] chapter
[1:01:15] we're going to begin at the first verse
[1:01:17] and it came to pass that as he was
[1:01:19] praying in a certain place when he
[1:01:22] ceased
[1:01:22] one of his disciples said unto him lord
[1:01:25] teach us to pray
[1:01:26] as john also taught his disciples to
[1:01:29] pray see they didn't even know how to
[1:01:30] pray
[1:01:32] they've seen the pharisees and the
[1:01:34] sadducees of whoever they saw the
[1:01:35] republicans
[1:01:36] whatever however dramatic they were but
[1:01:39] in them something made them know
[1:01:43] that was not the way to pray
[1:01:46] and sometimes we do it i like to pray
[1:01:49] out loud i do
[1:01:50] but sometimes we i've heard people pray
[1:01:52] like god was dead
[1:01:55] he couldn't hear me and it's not because
[1:01:58] of your loud speech that he hears you
[1:02:00] like i said it's the condition of your
[1:02:04] heart
[1:02:06] right you say what do you mean i'm going
[1:02:08] to skip a lot of this but let me say
[1:02:09] like this it's like
[1:02:10] hannah hannah wanted a child
[1:02:15] and her husband couldn't give her one
[1:02:18] and she went into desperation she began
[1:02:21] to fast pray
[1:02:22] and when she was praying she went into
[1:02:25] the church
[1:02:26] the synagogue right which
[1:02:29] wasn't allowed for women to do that but
[1:02:32] she went in there and prayed
[1:02:33] and when you know when uh eli saw her
[1:02:37] he thought like what's wrong with her
[1:02:39] because she looked like she was out of
[1:02:40] order
[1:02:41] women had their place in that day but
[1:02:44] she was so
[1:02:45] desperate she wanted a child
[1:02:48] right and she was so drunk in the spirit
[1:02:53] that eli saw her mouth moving and no
[1:02:56] words coming out
[1:02:57] you understand me so sometimes your
[1:02:59] mouth can move
[1:03:01] but you're not praying with your mouth
[1:03:03] you're praying with your heart
[1:03:06] and when you're praying with your heart
[1:03:07] god has to hear you
[1:03:10] right and she began to pray and and then
[1:03:13] you know
[1:03:15] the prophet thought she was drunk see
[1:03:17] that shows you god don't show the
[1:03:18] prophet everything
[1:03:20] the prophet thought she was drunk she
[1:03:21] says oh lord my lord don't don't look at
[1:03:24] me like a daughter of a liar
[1:03:26] no i have a petition
[1:03:30] oh my god i have a need my sorrow my
[1:03:34] pain
[1:03:34] has driven me to this point hallelujah
[1:03:38] and then she told the prophet what god
[1:03:40] what she wanted and god spoke to the
[1:03:42] prophet said give her that son
[1:03:45] you see what i'm saying god always hear
[1:03:48] a repentant heart
[1:03:51] sometimes people think well you know the
[1:03:53] bible said
[1:03:54] god don't hear a sin of prayer well the
[1:03:56] moment you repent
[1:03:58] you're no longer a sinner see
[1:04:01] but if your intent is to say it's the
[1:04:04] sin and continue to sin
[1:04:05] god will not hear you and i always tell
[1:04:08] people i said don't you understand
[1:04:10] you can't hide nothing from god god goes
[1:04:12] into the depths of your heart and see
[1:04:14] the very
[1:04:15] intent of your heart before you open
[1:04:17] your mouth
[1:04:18] so why god didn't answer well why
[1:04:20] weren't you honest
[1:04:24] yes you know and this is this this is
[1:04:27] one of the ways people pray
[1:04:29] well lord i really want a new job and
[1:04:31] and i i just heard this so
[1:04:33] don't think i'm throwing off on anybody
[1:04:35] you know i
[1:04:37] i just heard this so i need a new job
[1:04:40] uh um but you know i want more time
[1:04:44] that ain't the reason why that ain't all
[1:04:46] the reason why right
[1:04:48] you want more money
[1:04:52] be directly god cause if he just give
[1:04:54] you a job don't be dissatisfied
[1:04:57] you want more money and you want a new
[1:04:59] job
[1:05:02] you got to be direct with god y'all know
[1:05:05] what i'm saying i'm sorry bro i didn't
[1:05:06] it just came out of my mouth but my
[1:05:08] point is
[1:05:10] you know when you ask god direct for
[1:05:12] what you need and want
[1:05:13] that's how god will answer
[1:05:18] even though he know you haven't been
[1:05:20] true true with everything you're feeling
[1:05:22] he wants you to tell it just the way it
[1:05:25] is
[1:05:27] right hallelujah
[1:05:30] it's funny to me because i didn't expect
[1:05:32] it to come and he said unto them
[1:05:35] when ye pray in our father which art in
[1:05:37] heaven
[1:05:38] hallowed be thy name
[1:05:43] if we could really see what the
[1:05:44] scripture is saying here
[1:05:47] because we always want to put him in
[1:05:49] heaven and paul said we are in heavenly
[1:05:51] places in christ jesus
[1:05:54] right it's somehow we want to distant
[1:05:56] him
[1:05:57] and if you've got the holy ghost you you
[1:05:59] shouldn't distant god
[1:06:04] he said i'm in you
[1:06:07] i'll be with you always into the earth
[1:06:10] i'm going to be
[1:06:11] with you i wonder i just wonder
[1:06:14] i would have loved to hear the prayer of
[1:06:16] jesus
[1:06:20] i would have loved it just to see how he
[1:06:22] prayed
[1:06:26] i'm sure he didn't say oh heavenly
[1:06:28] father distance
[1:06:31] no god was with him
[1:06:35] god was in him and i don't know
[1:06:38] how he did it but i know one thing he
[1:06:42] knew god wasn't far off
[1:06:44] y'all understand me whenever you're
[1:06:46] praying and god seems to be far off
[1:06:49] you are misunderstanding your
[1:06:51] understanding theologically is something
[1:06:53] wrong
[1:06:55] because god is never far off you
[1:06:58] understand me
[1:06:59] oh i got to pray up here no no no that's
[1:07:02] what the bible said who going to bring
[1:07:04] him down
[1:07:06] he's in you and you must pray like he's
[1:07:10] in you
[1:07:12] hallelujah you understand me
[1:07:16] and when i say this because you know we
[1:07:18] first must understand
[1:07:19] we must hallow his name and a lot of
[1:07:23] time we don't hallow his name
[1:07:25] we don't call on his name enough we
[1:07:26] don't listen the sinners use his name
[1:07:28] more than we do
[1:07:30] even though they use it in vain and you
[1:07:32] know mockery and stuff like that
[1:07:34] but we need to exhort the name of jesus
[1:07:36] and
[1:07:37] even in prayer thy name you listen to
[1:07:40] david when he sang and what he
[1:07:42] he always exalted the name of god
[1:07:45] always and then when you start praying
[1:07:49] don't go selfishly now i'm not talking
[1:07:52] about a time of desperation when you got
[1:07:54] a desperate prayer you're going to pray
[1:07:55] desperately
[1:07:58] right and and so when you when you
[1:08:01] understand what god is doing
[1:08:03] you got to understand amen that when you
[1:08:05] pray and you're praying that god is
[1:08:08] is doing a great work and god is doing a
[1:08:10] great thing for you
[1:08:12] you understand you connected with god he
[1:08:14] said ask what show whatsoever you will
[1:08:16] now how many of y'all believe that and
[1:08:18] it shall be given to you
[1:08:26] i i even in this prayer i'm thinking
[1:08:29] about how
[1:08:30] you know situations provoke you to pray
[1:08:35] did y'all know that hannah had a
[1:08:37] situation that was uncontrollable she
[1:08:39] wanted
[1:08:39] a man a baby and her her other
[1:08:44] her husband's other wife
[1:08:47] was making mockery of her right so what
[1:08:50] i'm trying to say is sometimes god will
[1:08:52] put you in a place he'll provoke you to
[1:08:54] pray
[1:08:55] but he can't get you to pray he'll make
[1:08:57] things happen
[1:08:58] just to get you in a place of
[1:09:00] desperation
[1:09:02] hallelujah now none of us none of us
[1:09:04] here tonight
[1:09:05] amen want to miss the rapture none of us
[1:09:08] but sometimes you know what i'm saying
[1:09:11] and like like i was discussing this with
[1:09:13] somebody else
[1:09:13] the other day that might have been my
[1:09:15] son but he was listening to the greatest
[1:09:17] battle ever fought
[1:09:18] and brother branham used ezekiel and
[1:09:20] saying god will only mock those that
[1:09:22] sigh and cry
[1:09:23] and and because he asks how many in here
[1:09:25] might have been my wife
[1:09:26] how many in here who you say you got the
[1:09:28] holy oats and everybody raised their
[1:09:29] hand
[1:09:30] basically and he says but are you
[1:09:32] signing and crying
[1:09:35] see you might have some but you ain't
[1:09:37] got enough
[1:09:38] you understand what i'm saying because
[1:09:39] your love for the world or your people
[1:09:42] amen must come out of you you know what
[1:09:45] i mean like esther
[1:09:47] esther saw she had a love amen for the
[1:09:50] people
[1:09:51] and she says listen if i perish let me
[1:09:53] perish
[1:09:54] but what we're going to do is fast and
[1:09:56] pray we're going to consecrate ourselves
[1:09:58] three days
[1:09:59] and three nights without food or water
[1:10:02] because we're going to
[1:10:03] bring our petition before the king see
[1:10:06] that's how it is when
[1:10:07] you're really desperate for god to
[1:10:09] answer your prayer listen you don't you
[1:10:11] you we don't want to wonder we want to
[1:10:13] know
[1:10:14] and and that's me i was telling my
[1:10:17] wife because i'm going through so many
[1:10:19] changes right now in my person
[1:10:21] and i said you know what i'm i'm
[1:10:22] fighting to be dead
[1:10:25] i want to die i want to die completely
[1:10:28] to myself
[1:10:29] and now that i want to i see so much of
[1:10:31] myself
[1:10:35] huh and i hate that but you know what
[1:10:38] i'm a winner
[1:10:40] he made us a winner right the bible said
[1:10:43] he has given us
[1:10:44] all spiritual blessings in christ jesus
[1:10:47] hallelujah i don't care how many times i
[1:10:49] stumble and how many times i fall
[1:10:50] i have a goal and that's making a
[1:10:52] rapture
[1:10:54] he placed that in my heart and there
[1:10:56] ain't no way of giving that up
[1:11:00] god help us right and he goes on to say
[1:11:03] listen
[1:11:03] one of his disciples said unto him lord
[1:11:06] teach us to pray
[1:11:07] and as john has also taught his
[1:11:08] disciples to pray like i said prayer
[1:11:10] have been so corrupted and a lot of time
[1:11:12] they thought prayer
[1:11:13] was uh you know the more you can give
[1:11:16] god
[1:11:17] the easier he would listen to you you
[1:11:19] know like if you were rich
[1:11:20] you got prayers through if you were poor
[1:11:24] well too bad for you but that's not the
[1:11:27] way it was
[1:11:30] god heard yeah i think about that man at
[1:11:32] the pool of bethesda
[1:11:34] he couldn't even get into the pool and
[1:11:36] brother branham said he was
[1:11:37] not the worst in conditioned person
[1:11:40] there
[1:11:41] but he had to be praying something on
[1:11:44] the inside
[1:11:45] he may never ordered his mouth but
[1:11:47] something touched god
[1:11:49] that made jesus christ go by that pool
[1:11:52] and of all the people that were there he
[1:11:55] chose that man to heal
[1:11:58] huh who prays pray something else and
[1:12:01] you don't
[1:12:01] like i said you don't even have to open
[1:12:03] your mouth
[1:12:08] you don't need to let the devil know
[1:12:09] what you're talking about come
[1:12:11] here here in your closet shut the door
[1:12:15] [Laughter]
[1:12:19] lord i'm feeling pretty good tonight
[1:12:22] hallelujah look what he says uh you know
[1:12:24] you know even
[1:12:25] even like i said um when it was demanded
[1:12:29] can you imagine this man says listen i
[1:12:31] don't try
[1:12:33] and every time i try the thing that i
[1:12:36] see about this man he had perseverance
[1:12:39] he wouldn't quit he abided in the faith
[1:12:43] he knew that that angel would come down
[1:12:46] and at some point in time
[1:12:48] it was going to be his day now think
[1:12:50] about the power of
[1:12:52] of this man's prayer whatever he was
[1:12:54] doing
[1:12:55] pulled the angel out of the water
[1:12:56] [Laughter]
[1:12:59] holly is that right because only god
[1:13:01] could heal
[1:13:02] and he here pulled him out now he's in
[1:13:04] the flesh the same angel that was in the
[1:13:06] water comes along and healed him
[1:13:09] he didn't have to walk in the water the
[1:13:11] angel walked to him
[1:13:13] which was christ himself think about it
[1:13:17] and when you can't get to a place and
[1:13:18] can't get into a place
[1:13:20] don't be discouraged god is on your side
[1:13:24] if you can really stay within the word
[1:13:26] believe the word take the word
[1:13:28] at its value god will never forsake you
[1:13:32] nor will he leave you yes yes
[1:13:36] you know i love how the psalmist said if
[1:13:39] i make my bed in hell thou art there
[1:13:42] oh if i fly to the most part of the
[1:13:44] earth you know if i go about up there
[1:13:46] thou out there that's a man with a real
[1:13:47] revelation
[1:13:49] that understands amen who who god is
[1:13:56] i believe that's what we we know but you
[1:13:58] know what as we
[1:13:59] learn we ought to share it with other
[1:14:02] people
[1:14:04] because once you understand that you
[1:14:07] know what i learned i think i told
[1:14:08] brother troy this the other day
[1:14:09] i think i've been telling everybody
[1:14:11] because when brother uh enoch
[1:14:13] out of all of the in a enoch blessed me
[1:14:17] and enoch said that he had been
[1:14:20] abused uh you know bullied is the word
[1:14:23] he said he used he said he's been
[1:14:25] bullied
[1:14:25] all of his life growing up in the
[1:14:27] message and in hardships and things and
[1:14:30] then find it out he was dyslexic and
[1:14:32] then on top of that amen he
[1:14:34] he come to a place amen that you know it
[1:14:37] was
[1:14:37] many times of discouragement right
[1:14:41] and the times when he fully wanted to
[1:14:43] give up and there was always something
[1:14:44] there
[1:14:46] and then they found out he was disliked
[1:14:47] they they showed him how to work it
[1:14:51] and now he's teaching doctors medical
[1:14:53] doctors
[1:14:54] that's what he said he said now he look
[1:14:57] back and he can say
[1:14:58] every prayer he ever prayed god answered
[1:15:02] see let me tell you something you either
[1:15:03] believe it or not god
[1:15:05] always hear your prayer the prayer of a
[1:15:08] righteous man
[1:15:08] availeth much hallelujah
[1:15:12] and when you pray but you gotta
[1:15:14] understand it's always in god's own time
[1:15:20] hallelujah
[1:15:23] you know when when you talk about
[1:15:24] thanksgiving i always love that
[1:15:26] scripture uh enter his gaze with
[1:15:28] thanksgiving it enter his courts with
[1:15:30] praise and
[1:15:31] you know when you when you do that you
[1:15:33] know you you're really making god feel
[1:15:35] good
[1:15:36] do you know that i mean when you think
[1:15:38] about a king
[1:15:39] and you're coming in there he's sitting
[1:15:41] in his chair however you want to look at
[1:15:42] it and you come in there worshiping him
[1:15:45] and that's one of the things i liked
[1:15:46] about the uh 10 commandments you know
[1:15:49] when uh when when uh they came in with
[1:15:52] all of the
[1:15:53] the the what you call it they done won
[1:15:55] the battle and
[1:15:56] joseph coming in and and that narrator
[1:15:59] like about
[1:16:00] he's been rallying it all rallied it off
[1:16:02] like
[1:16:04] i'm like i can see myself before god
[1:16:08] you're going to rally it off all the
[1:16:10] victories you ever won
[1:16:12] there'll be somebody to rally it off
[1:16:17] said he says that old windbag
[1:16:20] but the thing it was a good thing it was
[1:16:22] a it was a worship it was a praise
[1:16:24] and guess what everything joseph had
[1:16:28] attained by way of war
[1:16:30] and victory became the glory of sethi
[1:16:35] you understand me so i say this all that
[1:16:38] we
[1:16:38] win every battle we win
[1:16:42] becomes the glory of god
[1:16:46] because he is the king of kings
[1:16:49] hallelujah
[1:16:50] you know we can't allow ourselves i said
[1:16:53] to
[1:16:53] come into a place of uh
[1:16:58] pride for prayer because you find that
[1:17:01] god don't hear that
[1:17:03] it doesn't matter if you unless your
[1:17:05] your heart has to be right
[1:17:07] clothed in humility right humble before
[1:17:10] god
[1:17:11] and and one thing for certain whenever
[1:17:13] you pray even from this pulpit you must
[1:17:16] pray unto the lord
[1:17:18] and not to the people
[1:17:23] right that's why i don't like praying in
[1:17:26] public
[1:17:28] because there's always that battle
[1:17:30] somebody's listening to your prayer
[1:17:32] and you feel that enticing spirit that
[1:17:35] makes you want to
[1:17:36] switch channels you forget you're
[1:17:39] praying to god
[1:17:40] but you want to say it good enough so
[1:17:42] the people say oh you know he could pray
[1:17:46] that has nothing to do with prayer god
[1:17:49] didn't hear
[1:17:50] one eye order of that when it's not done
[1:17:52] in the right spirit
[1:17:54] hebrews like i said six and eleven like
[1:17:56] i said it said but without faith it's
[1:17:58] impossible to please him
[1:18:00] so all your prayer means nothing if you
[1:18:02] don't pray in faith
[1:18:05] for he that cometh to god you know every
[1:18:07] time i think about that and i
[1:18:09] i just i just want to i just want to ask
[1:18:11] him
[1:18:13] you know joshua how did that inspiration
[1:18:16] feel you you
[1:18:20] you all you knew was moses pretty much
[1:18:22] but you had a greater revelation that
[1:18:24] the god of moses was god
[1:18:26] you understand me because when he said
[1:18:28] son stand still
[1:18:31] the bible says never had had the
[1:18:33] creation
[1:18:34] hearkened to the voice of a man i don't
[1:18:37] know the scientific stuff behind
[1:18:40] it but one thing i know
[1:18:43] it stood still yes sir y'all understand
[1:18:46] me
[1:18:47] now you say well what do you mean
[1:18:48] brother books i'm saying if god
[1:18:50] could use joshua in a way like that
[1:18:54] under the blood of bulls and goats what
[1:18:57] about
[1:18:57] us who's under the blood of jesus christ
[1:19:03] oh we're coming to a test right now
[1:19:05] we're not
[1:19:06] what we're going through ain't nothing
[1:19:08] but we're getting ready to go through a
[1:19:09] real test
[1:19:10] and god is going to prove to you to to
[1:19:12] you whether you believe the word or not
[1:19:16] huh it's coming to that time listen
[1:19:20] and you know what you're not going to
[1:19:21] have more than likely you know i'll put
[1:19:23] it this way you're not going to have
[1:19:24] these times
[1:19:26] you know to pray like you want to
[1:19:30] especially not out loud
[1:19:34] you know what i'm saying you're going to
[1:19:36] have to go into your closet because
[1:19:37] they're going to forbid you to pray
[1:19:39] so you better know what you got amen
[1:19:43] right make a joyful noise unto the lord
[1:19:45] all ye land
[1:19:47] serve the lord with gladness come before
[1:19:50] his presence with singing
[1:19:52] know ye that the lord he is god
[1:19:56] it is he that have made us and not we
[1:19:59] ourselves
[1:20:00] we are his people and the sheep of his
[1:20:03] pasture
[1:20:04] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[1:20:07] unto his core into his courts with
[1:20:09] praise
[1:20:10] be thankful unto him and bless his name
[1:20:14] for the lord is good his mercy is
[1:20:17] everlasting
[1:20:18] and the truth his truth endure to all
[1:20:21] generations
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:29] the greatest compliment i think jairus
[1:20:31] could have given
[1:20:32] jesus was lord i know what it
[1:20:36] means to be a ruler
[1:20:41] i say to my servants do this do this do
[1:20:43] this do that and they do it
[1:20:48] he didn't even have to pray basically he
[1:20:51] says lord i know
[1:20:52] who you are you know the lord said he
[1:20:56] knows everything we need
[1:20:58] he knows he says listen i know who you
[1:21:01] are
[1:21:01] all i need you to do is speak the word
[1:21:06] if we come to god like he is god
[1:21:10] and he is rewarded of them that word
[1:21:12] diligently means you don't give up
[1:21:15] you are a constant right
[1:21:18] it's like blind baltimore's amen when
[1:21:20] they told him
[1:21:21] that that was the son of david and all
[1:21:24] the people around him saying
[1:21:25] shut up shut up shut up he says not
[1:21:28] today
[1:21:29] if that be the son of david hallelujah
[1:21:33] i'm going to cry the loudest louder
[1:21:35] listen jesus never heard his voice
[1:21:39] but he felt the pull
[1:21:42] you see what i'm saying you want god to
[1:21:44] fill the pool
[1:21:46] and when god fills the pool you gets
[1:21:48] this attention
[1:21:50] amen hallelujah is that all right
[1:21:54] now they say they didn't pray but let me
[1:21:56] say about the woman at the well she had
[1:21:57] to do something
[1:22:00] amen jesus was a prophet
[1:22:03] the holy spirit tells jesus
[1:22:06] go by samaria and jesus said to his
[1:22:10] disciples
[1:22:10] i have a need to go by there i don't
[1:22:13] know what she was doing
[1:22:14] maybe that night that night she couldn't
[1:22:18] take it
[1:22:19] maybe that night she was fed up we don't
[1:22:21] know what was in her mind
[1:22:23] but when you say a need to go by that
[1:22:26] means desperation
[1:22:28] something was getting ready to happen
[1:22:29] that's not written there
[1:22:31] hallelujah and jesus i've got to go
[1:22:34] there to rescue her
[1:22:36] y'all understand thee so when you're the
[1:22:39] seed of god god will never let you go
[1:22:42] god will never see you fail or
[1:22:44] completely
[1:22:45] whatever he will always be there
[1:22:53] i have need to go by whoo that lady
[1:22:56] that that lady went down in history she
[1:22:58] shook up a town
[1:23:00] just with her testimony hallelujah
[1:23:04] the one thing i loved about her though
[1:23:06] she believed the word
[1:23:08] she may have been backslidden but she
[1:23:10] believed the word
[1:23:11] she was tired of religion don't you get
[1:23:13] tired of religion let me tell you
[1:23:15] something religion will hinder your
[1:23:16] prayer
[1:23:18] right because religion will make you
[1:23:20] think you're not worthy to pray
[1:23:22] if you're under the blood you've got
[1:23:24] every right to pray
[1:23:26] hallelujah and let me say it like this
[1:23:29] if you've made a mistake the holy ghost
[1:23:31] is obligated and he will
[1:23:33] make you know you made a mistake and you
[1:23:35] need to get it right
[1:23:37] remember when the prophet of god lied
[1:23:39] joseph tell him i'm not here
[1:23:42] he did he was a man he lied
[1:23:45] his wife told him bill you know that he
[1:23:48] right and you know with that sensitive
[1:23:50] heart he had
[1:23:52] he must have felt like his whole heart
[1:23:54] had dropped to the floor
[1:23:56] he went and got because he tried to pray
[1:23:58] and
[1:23:59] hear the word you hypocrite
[1:24:03] right because he knew better the
[1:24:05] scripture says if you have an art get it
[1:24:07] straight
[1:24:08] if there be anything that's in your
[1:24:10] spirit that's going to stop your prayer
[1:24:12] make it right lay it down then come back
[1:24:14] to the altar
[1:24:16] that's what he says because a lot of
[1:24:18] times people don't say
[1:24:19] well god is not answering my prayer
[1:24:21] because you're not being earnest and
[1:24:23] true
[1:24:24] amen but when you honest and true god
[1:24:27] will answer every one of your prayers
[1:24:29] he may not answer it the way you want it
[1:24:31] but he will answer it
[1:24:34] you love the lord he said like i said
[1:24:36] you know it doesn't necessarily
[1:24:38] i'm just i'm going to be working on this
[1:24:39] for a while because i'm enjoying it
[1:24:41] and it just won't be my last this this
[1:24:43] is the beginning of something because
[1:24:45] i'm really learning something myself
[1:24:48] now we know by god's grace that prayer
[1:24:50] doesn't have to necessarily be long
[1:24:53] i can remember i'm telling you many
[1:24:55] times we're about ready to rack
[1:24:58] and we say jesus the car stops
[1:25:01] like almost on a dime anybody know what
[1:25:05] i'm talking about
[1:25:06] i didn't even say lord help me because
[1:25:07] he heard it
[1:25:09] it was in the name of jesus i didn't
[1:25:12] have
[1:25:12] i didn't have time to say all the words
[1:25:14] that i needed to say
[1:25:15] y'all understand me hallelujah think
[1:25:18] about it
[1:25:21] when it comes to religion
[1:25:26] like uh uh the old testament saints
[1:25:29] thought you had to be so pure and clean
[1:25:31] before god could hear you now i don't
[1:25:34] know
[1:25:35] jesus busted this uh the pharisees it
[1:25:38] says
[1:25:39] you know you you white is supplica you
[1:25:42] you you clean the
[1:25:43] and wash all the tombs and then you know
[1:25:45] you and the other one put him in
[1:25:47] and you're dead men's bones now listen
[1:25:49] to this now everybody trusted in them
[1:25:53] their prayers weren't going nowhere no
[1:25:56] wonder everybody was so sick and
[1:25:58] afflicted
[1:25:59] god wasn't hearing it
[1:26:02] because the ones who they trusted in was
[1:26:04] corrupt
[1:26:06] their prayers were corrupt and that's
[1:26:09] why they hated jesus
[1:26:11] because all he could do sometime he'd go
[1:26:13] in his closet open his eyes and
[1:26:14] boom there it was a person was healed
[1:26:18] or he says rise up and walk what
[1:26:22] where did this authority come from it
[1:26:24] came from the god that you're supposed
[1:26:26] to be worshiping
[1:26:28] amen right god hasn't changed
[1:26:32] he's the same god i believe with all my
[1:26:35] heart
[1:26:36] the closer we get to god the more we'll
[1:26:38] see the supernatural of god
[1:26:41] because jesus christ cannot change
[1:26:43] hallelujah i believe amen within my
[1:26:46] heart
[1:26:46] amen that everybody in this fellowship
[1:26:49] when we
[1:26:50] all we need is one amen and i'm going
[1:26:54] i'm getting there no matter what it
[1:26:56] costs
[1:26:57] you see and i'm not just praying for me
[1:27:01] i'm praying for everybody
[1:27:03] i just believe amen that god has
[1:27:06] something special
[1:27:08] hallelujah what you're going to say
[1:27:11] about the thief of the cross
[1:27:14] and everybody have their opinion about
[1:27:16] it
[1:27:18] but god heard this man's prayer
[1:27:23] the blood hadn't even been on the altar
[1:27:25] yet
[1:27:27] god heard his prayer he was a man i
[1:27:30] don't know what he was prior to that
[1:27:32] but you know what happened he humbled
[1:27:34] himself
[1:27:35] he clothed himself in the military and
[1:27:37] he was able to see
[1:27:39] and recognize we're guilty that's what
[1:27:42] he said
[1:27:43] listen you and me we're guilty we
[1:27:46] deserve
[1:27:47] this but this man i find no fault
[1:27:52] here was a thief examining the lamb and
[1:27:55] he says listen
[1:27:56] he's not worthy of nothing wrong no ill
[1:27:59] say he's done
[1:28:00] nothing can you imagine here he is on
[1:28:03] the cross
[1:28:04] worshipping the lamb and didn't even
[1:28:05] know it
[1:28:07] amen but oh lord when i go into thy
[1:28:10] kingdom
[1:28:11] remember me
[1:28:14] and jesus said you'll be with me this
[1:28:16] day in paradise
[1:28:20] i don't know how happy people were in
[1:28:22] heaven but when he got there
[1:28:24] i think he was about the happiest one
[1:28:25] ever
[1:28:26] [Laughter]
[1:28:27] knowing that he was hanging right over
[1:28:29] hell and god snatched him out
[1:28:33] see that's what i'm saying prayer in
[1:28:34] itself when you
[1:28:36] trust god see but the thing is you got
[1:28:38] to trust him
[1:28:41] you must trust him you must trust him
[1:28:45] turn with me now to matthew 5
[1:28:46] 6 please you love the lord
[1:28:50] i'm not going to be too much longer i'm
[1:28:51] just this is just a
[1:28:53] a prelude or something that i want to
[1:28:55] get into um
[1:28:57] because i really do believe that once
[1:28:58] this church began to pray like we ought
[1:29:00] to god will answer
[1:29:02] he's going to answer in a mighty way you
[1:29:04] know and that's that's what i believe
[1:29:07] and when i say church i mean wherever
[1:29:09] whoever
[1:29:11] its prayer is the key right
[1:29:14] because remember god didn't even send
[1:29:17] the deliverer
[1:29:18] to e israel until they got into the
[1:29:21] prayer mode
[1:29:23] when the task masters got hard on them
[1:29:26] they began to pray
[1:29:27] and they failed to see at that time that
[1:29:30] they were very
[1:29:31] they were in the scripture god had
[1:29:34] promised
[1:29:34] a deliverer after 400 years and they
[1:29:37] were there
[1:29:38] they were that generation so i want you
[1:29:41] to understand we're the generation
[1:29:43] that's going to see a change of the body
[1:29:46] we're the generation
[1:29:48] we've got to go through all that we've
[1:29:49] got to go through but it's all right
[1:29:52] as long as you trust him and abide in
[1:29:55] his word
[1:29:56] is okay this little suffering and things
[1:29:59] we're going through
[1:30:00] and we must all go through it
[1:30:02] everybody's got their own
[1:30:04] battle and i'm gonna tell you something
[1:30:06] you wouldn't want mine and i said like
[1:30:08] this i don't want yours
[1:30:10] every man must carry their own cross
[1:30:14] hallelujah i can't judge your situation
[1:30:17] and you can't judge mine
[1:30:21] because i believe with all my heart at
[1:30:23] the end of the day
[1:30:26] it's like a what you call those
[1:30:28] paintings
[1:30:32] yeah say it again mosaic
[1:30:37] you got all those little pieces together
[1:30:39] and once you put them together it's a
[1:30:40] beautiful artwork
[1:30:42] that's the way i see it that's the way i
[1:30:45] see it and now
[1:30:46] one piece is the same not one piece
[1:30:48] there's always variations in him
[1:30:51] hallelujah glory to god i believe in
[1:30:55] prayer
[1:30:55] but like i said the condition of the
[1:30:58] heart
[1:30:59] you cannot approach god and think he's
[1:31:01] going to answer your prayer
[1:31:03] if you have some bitterness in your
[1:31:05] heart
[1:31:07] anything like that that's going yeah you
[1:31:09] got to go get it right
[1:31:13] he's already answered it but you got to
[1:31:15] correct that
[1:31:17] right he the bible said he knows what
[1:31:20] you're going to ask before you ask
[1:31:24] so uh but but there there is
[1:31:27] like you said a provided way a way that
[1:31:29] he has provided for us
[1:31:31] before we can approach you can't
[1:31:32] approach can you imagine
[1:31:35] coming up before king and you all you
[1:31:36] got on his rags you're dirty and you're
[1:31:38] filthy
[1:31:39] right that kick you out you wouldn't
[1:31:42] even get close to him
[1:31:46] right like brother adam said you go into
[1:31:48] a law firm and
[1:31:49] you know you're on trial and you say to
[1:31:51] the judge what's happening judge
[1:31:53] they're going to kick you out
[1:31:57] you may not even have all the evidence
[1:31:59] everything you need
[1:32:00] to defend yourself but your approach
[1:32:03] is disrespectful
[1:32:06] right one of the things i i
[1:32:10] tell you what if you listen to brother
[1:32:12] branham when he prays he always talk
[1:32:14] about calvary
[1:32:15] he always talk about the blood of jesus
[1:32:18] you gotta
[1:32:19] you you're praying and you're not even
[1:32:20] talking about the blood of jesus you
[1:32:21] forget it
[1:32:22] you're not even approaching him right
[1:32:26] because the only way we can get to him
[1:32:27] is through the blood
[1:32:30] matthew 6 5-8
[1:32:36] god be with us and when thou prayeth
[1:32:39] thou shall not be as the hypocrites are
[1:32:42] for they love to pray standing
[1:32:46] in the synagogues and in the corners of
[1:32:48] the streets
[1:32:49] that they may be seen of men verily i
[1:32:52] say unto you
[1:32:53] they have their reward but thou when
[1:32:56] thou
[1:32:57] prayeth enter into thy closet and when
[1:33:00] thou hath
[1:33:01] shut thy door pray to the father which
[1:33:04] is
[1:33:04] in secret and thy father which is see it
[1:33:07] in secret shall reward thee openly but
[1:33:10] when you pray
[1:33:12] use not vain repetition as the heathens
[1:33:15] do
[1:33:16] for they think that they shall be heard
[1:33:18] for their much speaking
[1:33:21] be not ye therefore like unto them
[1:33:24] for your father knoweth what things you
[1:33:26] have need of
[1:33:28] before you ask hallelujah and he goes
[1:33:31] and he goes on and says after this
[1:33:33] manner therefore pray ye
[1:33:35] our father which art in heaven see you
[1:33:38] acknowledging him that he is your father
[1:33:40] we're talking about spiritually you know
[1:33:42] a lot of time for years
[1:33:44] when he would go and say give us this
[1:33:45] day our daily bread
[1:33:47] i thought it was natural i mean you know
[1:33:49] every time i prayed i saw a
[1:33:50] loaf of bread in my mind god is my
[1:33:55] witness to the truth
[1:33:58] the bottom two right but he's talking
[1:34:02] about spiritual food and due season
[1:34:04] the bread of life give us this day
[1:34:08] our daily bread our daily revelation
[1:34:11] what we need to make this journey
[1:34:15] huh now i'm going to say something to
[1:34:17] you
[1:34:18] all of you before i stop do you think
[1:34:22] god is creating us and making us
[1:34:26] into his very image to just take us to
[1:34:29] heaven
[1:34:31] no no no no
[1:34:35] we must show who we are on earth
[1:34:38] before we get to heaven it's not going
[1:34:41] to be an open show
[1:34:43] but remember jesus said in his own words
[1:34:47] there coming a time if you would say to
[1:34:49] this mountain
[1:34:51] be thou move it shall be done
[1:34:55] that's where he's bringing us into that
[1:34:57] adoption into that place where the word
[1:35:00] you become the word and the word become
[1:35:02] you
[1:35:03] right that god tabernacling in your
[1:35:06] flesh you have union
[1:35:07] you're union with him you're you're
[1:35:09] you're one
[1:35:10] and i know to the world this is sound
[1:35:12] blasphemy but this
[1:35:14] is what god is doing by way of this
[1:35:16] message
[1:35:17] and he took us out of organization and
[1:35:19] denominationalism
[1:35:20] so there'll be nothing hindering the
[1:35:24] growth of his children
[1:35:26] he set us free
[1:35:29] right hallelujah almost done
[1:35:36] after this man of therefore pray ye our
[1:35:38] father which art in heaven
[1:35:40] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:35:43] thy will be done
[1:35:44] in earth as it is in heaven and his
[1:35:47] kingdom has come
[1:35:48] yes and his kingdom is in you that's
[1:35:50] what the bible says
[1:35:52] it's not a meat and drink it's in the
[1:35:54] holy ghost
[1:35:55] right give us this day our daily bread
[1:35:58] listen
[1:35:59] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:36:02] our debtors you can't go no further
[1:36:07] till that is done lead us not into
[1:36:10] temptation and i always thought
[1:36:12] you know for a long time god was leading
[1:36:14] me into temptation
[1:36:15] no no no no no he's keeping you from
[1:36:18] temptation
[1:36:19] basically that's what he's doing he's
[1:36:21] providing eyes to see
[1:36:24] that when you come into an area you can
[1:36:26] recognize the sin
[1:36:29] god is leading lambs right
[1:36:33] but deliver us from evil for thine is
[1:36:36] the kingdom
[1:36:37] the power and the glory forever and ever
[1:36:40] now god will bring you into places but
[1:36:43] let me
[1:36:43] say well okay brother but if if he's not
[1:36:46] leading us
[1:36:47] the bible says that god led uh
[1:36:50] is jesus into the into
[1:36:53] uh into the wilderness to be tempted of
[1:36:57] the devil
[1:36:58] now he put the devil there but he didn't
[1:37:00] lead him into temptation
[1:37:02] he knew the temptation would be there
[1:37:04] you understand me see
[1:37:06] don't make god evil
[1:37:09] the bible says god don't tempt and
[1:37:12] neither is he tempted
[1:37:13] so what you're going to do with that
[1:37:14] scripture
[1:37:16] you got to figure it out there's a
[1:37:18] revelation here
[1:37:20] right that god allows you to go places
[1:37:23] even though he knows the tempter is
[1:37:25] there but he's not doing the tempting
[1:37:28] the devil is so if you understand
[1:37:31] there's only two powers
[1:37:32] god power and the devil's power
[1:37:36] and if you recognize the true scripture
[1:37:38] you understand that
[1:37:39] now since calvary the devil has no power
[1:37:44] so you and i must understand that we've
[1:37:46] got all the power
[1:37:48] that we need we just need to tap into it
[1:37:51] and this power come by way of our
[1:37:53] earnest heart
[1:37:54] this is my favorite scripture out of all
[1:37:56] the scriptures in the world
[1:37:57] oh in the bible only the pure and hard
[1:38:02] shall see god and i know i can't make my
[1:38:06] heart pure
[1:38:07] but i know the purifier i know the god
[1:38:11] who can the god who will and he's
[1:38:13] protested made
[1:38:14] destinated us to do so amen is that
[1:38:17] right
[1:38:18] because the bible said only he can
[1:38:20] present
[1:38:21] us faultless before the throne of god
[1:38:25] [Laughter]
[1:38:27] and we are accepted in the beloved you
[1:38:30] believe those scriptures
[1:38:31] so when you are accepted and to be loved
[1:38:33] that means that you are
[1:38:34] everything in this book is at your hands
[1:38:39] not just at your hands but in your hands
[1:38:41] you got we got to believe in people
[1:38:44] and if there be any unbelief we must say
[1:38:46] lord remove the unbelief
[1:38:48] because the unbelief is sin and and i
[1:38:51] don't understand
[1:38:52] how he works completely you know
[1:38:56] but like he said who shall know the mind
[1:38:58] of god
[1:38:59] but one thing i know he's given us the
[1:39:01] mind of christ
[1:39:02] and the mind of christ was to be
[1:39:04] obedient to
[1:39:06] every word let's stand
[1:39:10] thank you just keep on praying
[1:39:16] for the lord is nigh
[1:39:19] just keep on praying
[1:39:22] hear hear your cry
[1:39:25] for the lord has time
[1:39:28] and his word is true
[1:39:31] don't keep on praying
[1:39:34] he'll answer you
[1:39:38] church keep on praying
[1:39:41] for the lord tonight
[1:39:44] just keep on praying
