[18:05] Amen. Ask brother Josh Mensah if you
[18:08] could come and open with a word of
[18:09] prayer.
[18:22] Let's bow our heads for a word of
[18:24] prayer.
[18:26] Heavenly gracious father, we thank you
[18:27] for today. Thank you for the grace of
[18:30] life. We thank you for the grace of
[18:32] grace, Lord Jesus, just to be here in
[18:34] your presence, Lord. It's not by our
[18:36] doing. It's not by our wealth. It's not
[18:38] by our minds, Lord. The Bible says it's
[18:41] by your grace, Lord Jesus.
[18:44] We want to commit ourselves into your
[18:45] hands today.
[18:47] Each and every single thing we do, each
[18:49] and every single thing we say,
[18:51] our thoughts, our minds, Lord Jesus, may
[18:54] they all be one accord. Lord Jesus, just
[18:56] an expectation for your word to come and
[18:58] just fill us today.
[19:01] Want to ask Lord that you bless the
[19:02] singing, bless the people here,
[19:06] our pastor who is bringing the word of
[19:08] God, Lord Jesus, may you just anoint him
[19:11] and be with him, Lord Jesus. We pray,
[19:14] asking that all that seeking this place
[19:16] be healed. May those with requests, Lord
[19:19] Jesus, may your anointing fill them. May
[19:22] you make it happen before even they open
[19:24] their mouths to ask, Lord Jesus. and may
[19:26] just come and fill this place with the
[19:29] holy fire, with the Holy Spirit. And may
[19:32] there be a revival today, Lord Jesus.
[19:35] And may we go back, Lord Jesus, like the
[19:37] men from Emos who said, "Did our hearts
[19:40] not bend within us as he yet speak with
[19:42] us today, have your way this morning and
[19:46] this day and this week
[19:49] we pray Jesus name." Amen.
[19:56] We can take our seats for a little
[19:58] while. We have a testimony from brother
[20:00] Joshi.
[20:06] Thank praise the Lord to see all you
[20:08] saints here out on a cold morning. I'm
[20:10] sure it's a lot different than Africa.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I just have a short
[20:21] testimony this morning.
[20:23] This conversation with the Lord Jesus
[20:25] Christ is becoming more and more real
[20:28] day to day.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord on Friday nights at 7,
[20:35] we have a Bible study here at Higher
[20:37] Ground Tabernacle.
[20:42] On my way home from Bible study, I
[20:44] really wanted some chicken, so I stopped
[20:46] at Walmart.
[20:51] As I pulled up and parked, I said,
[20:54] "Lord, I'm gonna pick up some money from
[20:55] the parking lot
[21:04] parking lot, and then I went into
[21:06] Walmart and Walmart, shopped, got my
[21:10] chicken,
[21:12] &gt;&gt; and on the walk out of Walmart, on my
[21:14] way to my car,
[21:20] &gt;&gt; there's $20 on the ground that I picked
[21:22] up.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to thank and praise the
[21:27] Lord for honoring my words
[21:32] &gt;&gt; and bringing to pass a little extra
[21:33] money that paid for my dinner on Friday
[21:36] night.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:45] We thank God he's he's Jehovah Gyra.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; He is our provider. He provided all our
[21:51] needs.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; He says if he shall ask anything in my
[21:54] name,
[21:55] &gt;&gt; he said, "I will do it." Amen. It
[21:57] doesn't matter how little you think your
[21:59] request is.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; He can provide it. Doesn't matter how
[22:02] big you think it is, he can still
[22:04] provide it. Let us stand up on our feet.
[22:07] Let us sing this song. When I remember
[22:10] what the Lord has done for me, I will
[22:13] never go back. Amen. How many can say
[22:15] that's my testimony this morning?

[22:23] remember
[22:25] what the Lord
[22:28] has done,

[22:35] anymore.

[23:06] has done, I will deliver.

[41:21] Jesus,
[41:22] we have the victory.
[41:27] Oh, in the name of Jesus, the mighty
[41:31] name of Jesus. Oh, demons will have to
[41:36] live.
[41:38] Oh, when we come in the name of Jesus,
[41:45] tell me who can

[41:53] &gt;&gt; preious
[41:55] name of Jesus
[41:58] we have. Let's sing it one more time. Oh
[42:02] yeah. In the name of Jesus.
[42:07] In the name of Jesus, we have the
[42:11] victory.
[42:14] Oh, in the name of Jesus.
[42:18] In the name of Jesus, all demons will
[42:22] have
[42:25] for
[42:26] when we come in the name of Jesus. Tell
[42:32] me who can stand before that
[42:39] precious name of Jesus. We have so when
[42:45] we come
[42:54] &gt;&gt; till we broen
[43:00] the precious name of Jesus we have the
[43:06] victory.
[43:14] Okay. Okay.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I guess it's on now, huh?
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; God is good to us. Amen.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; God is good
[43:27] all the time.
[43:30] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[43:34] mine. God is good
[43:38] all the time.
[43:41] In the darkest night, his light will
[43:45] shine. God is good.
[43:49] God is good
[43:51] all the time.
[43:55] Once again, God is good
[43:59] all the time.
[44:02] I'm talking
[44:04] in this heart of mine. God is good
[44:10] all the time.
[44:12] In the darkest night, his lights will
[44:16] shine. God is good. Hey,
[44:20] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. All the time.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't God good? Ain't God good?
[44:30] To give us so many blessings
[44:33] undetermined.
[44:35] That's what we are.
[44:38] We are to thank you,
[44:41] &gt;&gt; love and praise
[44:43] a little more today and a whole lot more
[44:47] tomorrow. Once again, God
[44:51] give us so many blessings undeserved.
[44:56] That's what we are.
[44:59] We are to thank him. Love and praise
[45:04] a little more today and a whole lot more
[45:08] tomorrow.
[45:10] God is good
[45:12] all the time.
[45:15] He put a song of praise in his heart of
[45:19] mine. God is good
[45:23] all the time.
[45:26] In the darkest night, in light will
[45:30] shine. God is good.
[45:33] God is good
[45:36] all the time.
[45:42] Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; He's good all the time.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what we go through.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; He's always good.
[45:55] Glad to see you all this morning
[45:58] by his grace of God. Can we as we stand,
[46:02] &gt;&gt; let us turn, let us turn to Proverbs 16
[46:08] &gt;&gt; and then from there we'll go to
[46:09] Ecclesiastes 8,
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16 and 10.
[46:25] And it reads,
[46:27] "A divine sentence is in the lips of the
[46:31] king. His mouth transgressth not in
[46:36] judgment."
[46:44] Ecclesiastes
[46:47] &gt;&gt; 8
[46:49] &gt;&gt; 4-6.
[47:00] Where the word of a king is, there is
[47:04] power. And who may say unto him, "What
[47:09] doest thou?
[47:16] Whosoever keepeth the commandment shall
[47:18] feel no evil thing, and a wise man's
[47:23] heart discernneth both time and
[47:26] judgment.
[47:33] Because to every purpose there is time
[47:36] and judgment. Therefore, the misery of a
[47:40] man is great upon him.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; St. John 1, please.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; We'll read the first uh four verses.
[48:02] In the beginning was the word and the
[48:06] word was with God and the word was God.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God.
[48:19] All things were made by him and without
[48:22] him was not anything made that was made.
[48:30] In him was life and the life was the
[48:34] light of men.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[48:41] Our heavenly father God, we come before
[48:43] you. We thank you for your grace and
[48:46] your mercy. We thank you for being so
[48:49] good to us.
[48:51] Lord, you have been better to us than
[48:53] we've been to ourselves.
[48:56] with you. We pray for the service this
[48:58] morning.
[49:00] We cast down every evil imagination.
[49:04] We bring every thought
[49:06] that is not like you, Lord. We cast it
[49:10] down. We bring it Lord under subjection
[49:14] by by the power and authority of your
[49:17] name, Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[49:24] Amen. We'd like to entitle this message
[49:28] having his authority.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Subtopic the words of a king.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have been uh preaching
[49:43] on the throne of God. Your position in
[49:46] God,
[49:48] what God is expecting out of you.
[49:52] Now I like to say this by the grace of
[49:54] God
[49:56] that everybody uh has a place.
[50:00] You are
[50:01] &gt;&gt; you are positioned in God.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Whether you are a housewife,
[50:07] manager, a journalist, journalist,
[50:10] &gt;&gt; president, whatever you may be, God
[50:13] ordained us to be.
[50:16] And you must understand
[50:19] that even in the field that God has
[50:21] ordained you in,
[50:23] he has also ordained you to be perfect.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; So he expects you
[50:32] uh with whatever gift he's given you
[50:36] to express
[50:38] Christ through that gift.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Your gift has not been given to you to
[50:44] bury.
[50:48] But whatever it may be,
[50:50] it has been given to you to glorify God.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; One thing about the word of a king,
[51:01] as the scripture said, it is power
[51:05] and I think that's where we fail
[51:07] sometimes.
[51:10] As I said uhh on on last uh Wednesday.
[51:16] when when it comes to the Bible or the
[51:19] mind of God,
[51:22] the word is the mind of God.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And you and I must understand that if if
[51:29] God has spoken that word,
[51:33] whatever word it may be, if God speaks
[51:35] it, it's powerful.
[51:39] But the Bible as it is,
[51:42] if it's not quickened
[51:45] to you, it's just another uh reading
[51:49] like reading another book or reading a a
[51:51] newspaper.
[51:54] Uh and that's where we are finding
[51:57] ourselves coming short
[52:00] because you must understand that the
[52:02] word of a king is invincible.
[52:07] Once the word goes out the mouth of a
[52:10] king,
[52:12] there's no way that he can retract it.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; It becomes law.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; And it it it and and and it its meaning
[52:26] is absolute power,
[52:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:31] &gt;&gt; The decree whatever it may be,
[52:34] &gt;&gt; it's final.
[52:36] and unquestionable.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Throw an example. If God said, "Lay
[52:43] hands on the sick, they shall recover."
[52:47] &gt;&gt; He said it
[52:50] &gt;&gt; and that's truth.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; And it's unquestionable.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we must understand
[53:00] when we emphasize
[53:04] the spoken commands
[53:07] &gt;&gt; immediately it becomes a binding lawmak
[53:16] does God still do
[53:19] what he said he'll do?
[53:22] Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same
[53:25] yesterday, today, and forever.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Now, if we can't we can say, "Oh, I got
[53:31] faith in God."
[53:34] But if you don't have faith in his word,
[53:37] you are deceived.
[53:40] You can't have faith in God and not have
[53:43] faith in his word.
[53:45] And faith is something God gives you.
[53:49] You don't earn it. It comes to you by
[53:52] grace.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And another thing,
[53:57] &gt;&gt; the Bible said that the word is God.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what God is?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; It's different from Elohim.
[54:08] Elohim is the self-existing one.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; But when we refer to God, we're saying
[54:15] that we're worshiping
[54:17] the self-existing one. Is that right?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Because God is the object of worship.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; And if you and I don't come to worship
[54:29] the word,
[54:33] we're not worshiping God because God is
[54:36] the word.
[54:38] Does that make sense? Now, the Bible
[54:40] says that all things were made by him
[54:45] and without him was not anything made.
[54:50] that was made
[54:52] &gt;&gt; and in him was life
[54:56] and the life was the light of men.
[55:00] Every time I read that
[55:02] I think about character
[55:05] the way a man or woman ought to be
[55:10] after the fall of Adam. We never
[55:13] understood what a real man was.
[55:16] Everything else was perverted.
[55:18] until Jesus came.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; He was the full form statue uh attribute
[55:27] of God.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in him dwelt the
[55:34] fullness
[55:36] of the Godhead body.
[55:39] The the seals have not been opened
[55:43] for us to be just another church.
[55:47] Hallelujah. When God sent Malachi 4
[55:52] &gt;&gt; and the word was open in 1963.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:57] There were there were great mysteries.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; In the message in which Malachi 4
[56:03] preached
[56:05] that we are now coming into light of.
[56:10] Is that all right? Remember when brother
[56:12] Brandham
[56:14] came and saw that pyramid rock that was
[56:16] white,
[56:20] he told the ministers to look on this.
[56:24] HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS IT? It was a word
[56:27] that not had not yet been revealed.
[56:32] Hallelujah. Is that okay? Now, I'm not
[56:35] preaching some doctrine.
[56:37] I'm preaching what brother said. And you
[56:40] and I must understand that this message
[56:44] does not stand still.
[56:47] It's a progressive message.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[56:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't stop with John the Baptist.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; It moved on to Jesus Christ.
[56:59] IT DIDN'T EVEN STOP AT Jesus
[57:03] because Paul said, "We don't know him no
[57:05] longer
[57:07] in the flesh."
[57:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT WE KNOW HIM AFTER THE
[57:11] SPIRIT.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S A
[57:15] PROGRESSIVE revelation
[57:17] that's literally transforming
[57:20] and changing men and women INTO TRUE
[57:24] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[57:27] And let me say it like this.
[57:30] It's not what you do, but it's what he's
[57:33] DOING FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. I can't
[57:36] change myself.
[57:38] YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOURSELF, BUT I BELIEVE
[57:42] in the change. I BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD
[57:46] has promised me change from glory to
[57:50] glory. From glory to glory AND I LOOK
[57:54] FOR THAT CHANGE. HALLELUJAH. AND WITH
[57:57] THE CHANGE, THE WORD OF GOD BRINGS
[58:00] AUTHORITY.
[58:02] HALLELUJAH.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
[58:06] I SPOKE LIKE A CHILD. I ACT LIKE A
[58:09] CHILD. I WALK LIKE A CHILD. I DID
[58:12] CHILDISH THINGS.
[58:14] BUT WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME,
[58:18] I PUT AWAY THE CHILDISH.
[58:21] NOT THIS MORNING. THAT WHICH IS PERFECT
[58:25] is come. HALLELUJAH. AND IS DOING JUST
[58:28] WHAT HE SAID.
[58:30] HALLELUJAH.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Let me say IT LIKE THIS.
[58:35] MANY people may not recognize this
[58:37] message,
[58:39] but I'm going to go show you that people
[58:42] know that this message is right.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Turn with me to Joshua 2.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Joshua 2, starting at the ninth verse.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; See, it ain't good enough just to say, I
[58:59] believe the message.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God ain't And God ain't
[59:04] changing you.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; There is no way
[59:09] &gt;&gt; that you can feast off the mana
[59:12] &gt;&gt; that comes from the Holies of Holies
[59:16] and not be changed.
[59:18] Not by your power, not by your might,
[59:22] but by his spirit.
[59:24] Oh, brother said what we need to do is
[59:27] lay in the presence of the son.
[59:31] Stay with the text. Stay with the word.
[59:35] STAY IN YOUR BIBLE. HALLELUJAH. STAY IN
[59:38] THE ATMOSPHERE
[59:40] atmosphere
[59:41] &gt;&gt; of THE PRESENCE.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND ME? When he say LAY IN
[59:45] THE PRESENCE, THAT MEANS HE must be
[59:48] here.
[59:50] HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T BE IN THE PRESENCE
[59:52] OF SOMEONE IF THAT SOMEONE IS NOT HERE.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And for those of us who
[59:59] don't believe he's here,
[1:00:02] I can truly say you're not laying in his
[1:00:03] presence.
[1:00:06] Listen what Rahab says starting at the
[1:00:10] night verse. And she said unto the men,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I know that the Lord have given you the
[1:00:17] land,
[1:00:20] and that your terror is fallen upon us,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:00:26] faint because of you.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We for we 10th verse for we
[1:00:32] have heard
[1:00:35] how the Lord dried up the waters of the
[1:00:38] Red Sea for you
[1:00:40] when you came out of Egypt
[1:00:43] and what he did unto the two kings of
[1:00:46] the Amorites
[1:00:49] that were on the other side Jordan
[1:00:53] and Oz
[1:00:55] whom ye utterly destroyed.
[1:00:58] And this is what gets me.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Rahab says, "We know.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; We have heard."
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; SO ALL THE DENOMINATIONS,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE HEARD,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE SEEN
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; THE JOSHUA OF OUR DAY.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And they are trembling.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Because the MORE THEY TRIED TO STOP US,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; THE GREATER WE HAVE BECOME.
[1:01:29] HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; But let me say it like this.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; We don't need a greater number
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; for God to be made manifest.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; So you are quick in your understanding.
[1:01:47] Enoch was one. Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Out of millions.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; We are trillions. We don't know how how
[1:01:54] great the population.
[1:01:56] He was just one. And that's what the
[1:01:59] Bible said. God has never left himself
[1:02:02] without a witness.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And whether we enter into
[1:02:07] the message or not
[1:02:10] those who are ordained to do so,
[1:02:13] whether you like it OR NOT, GOD WILL
[1:02:17] ALWAYS FORCE THE ISSUE.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Is that right?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, look at look at Samson.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Samson. Samson was ordained to to kill
[1:02:26] and destroy the Philistines.
[1:02:29] Samson Samson kind of backslid.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He did backslide. AND GOD STILL SAID,
[1:02:35] "But I chose you."
[1:02:38] You hear what I'm saying? So what I'm
[1:02:40] trying to say is whatever God has
[1:02:42] ordained for you to do,
[1:02:45] WHETHER YOU BE BACKSLIDING NOW OR NOT,
[1:02:49] nobody can take your place.
[1:02:54] I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU COMFORT OR
[1:02:56] BRING comfort to you in a backsliding
[1:02:58] state.
[1:03:00] LOOK WHAT SAMSON HAD TO GO THROUGH
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; before his eyes were open.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm not TALKING ABOUT HIS NATURAL
[1:03:08] EYES UNTIL HIS SPIRITUAL EYES WAS OPEN.
[1:03:12] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. If that's what
[1:03:14] you rather go through, then go through
[1:03:16] it.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; As soon as we have heard these things,
[1:03:22] Our hearts did melt.
[1:03:25] 11th verse. Neither did there remain any
[1:03:28] more courage in any man because of you.
[1:03:32] For the Lord your God he is. Listen what
[1:03:35] he says. For she is saying we know for
[1:03:39] the Lord your God he is God in heaven
[1:03:44] above and earth beneath.
[1:03:49] You you just think that she just got it
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; or heard it herself
[1:03:54] just just Rahab,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE BELIEVING IT.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I WONDER THIS MORNING,
[1:04:01] HOW MANY OF YOU REALLY believe it?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU SAY,
[1:04:08] "WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BROTHER?" BUT
[1:04:09] LIKE I SAID LAST WEEK, YOUR REVELATION
[1:04:13] of this message will show your worship.
[1:04:18] HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T SAY I BELIEVE THIS
[1:04:21] message and you DON'T HAVE A WORSHIP.
[1:04:25] I DIDN'T SAY PRAISE
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; CUZ EVERYTHING can praise him.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The trees PRAISE HIM.
[1:04:33] HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU AND I, WE ARE THE
[1:04:35] ONLY ONES THAT CAN WORSHIP HIM. AND IF
[1:04:38] WE WORSHIP, IT MUST BE IN SPIRIT AND
[1:04:41] TRUTH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I see things
[1:04:47] uh changing.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; The authority of the word is now living
[1:04:51] in me.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT JUST LIKE JESUS, JUST
[1:04:56] LIKE WILLIAM BRHAM, if you can't get the
[1:04:59] people to believe
[1:05:01] is of effect. HALLELUJAH. UNBELIEF CAN'T
[1:05:05] YOU won't move God at all.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Unbelief you won't won't move God at
[1:05:12] all.
[1:05:15] Hallelujah. Now, if if a heathen nation
[1:05:19] or a people like Rahab
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; because she had to get her family to
[1:05:25] believe what she believed.
[1:05:28] And understand that she didn't read it
[1:05:30] nowhere. She just heard of the
[1:05:32] miraculous things.
[1:05:35] Y'all understand me? Can I put it in in
[1:05:37] our language?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon was not just
[1:05:41] a preacher.
[1:05:43] but we heard
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; of the miraculous things he did.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And we knew it wasn't a man.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Now, you sisters, I'm going to tell
[1:05:58] y'all, let let me say it like this. Let
[1:06:01] me move. I I have to talk with you
[1:06:02] later. When it comes to God,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; God wants you to worship him. But God
[1:06:09] also know that worshiping God
[1:06:13] on the level of understanding that we
[1:06:15] have
[1:06:18] is above the Pentecostal realm.
[1:06:22] Now God don't care if you shout. God
[1:06:25] don't care if you dance.
[1:06:27] God don't even care if you speak in
[1:06:28] tongue.
[1:06:30] He doesn't care if you run. Y'ALL HEAR
[1:06:33] WHAT I'M SAYING? Everything is a order
[1:06:36] to it.
[1:06:37] AND WHEN I SAY THAT IS THE WORD is God.
[1:06:42] The word will always come first.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CAN I SAY IT LIKE THIS? IF I
[1:06:48] WAS A KING AND WHILE I WAS SPEAKING, YOU
[1:06:52] WOULD INTERRUPT MY SPEAKING.
[1:06:56] HALLELUJAH. Come on, somebody.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Esther was on the line.
[1:07:02] That's right.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But my point is,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to stunt any kind of gift
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; or anything that God has given you.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But everything must come in
[1:07:16] its order.
[1:07:18] And it must come in a way that God is
[1:07:21] speaking directly.
[1:07:24] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE EVERY
[1:07:27] ONE OF US GOT SOME KIND OF GIFT going
[1:07:29] on.
[1:07:31] BUT YOU AND I MUST UNDERSTAND.
[1:07:33] HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT A REBUKE.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I'M I'M ENCOURAGING YOU. LET GO AND LET
[1:07:40] GOD,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; BUT DO IT THE WAY GOD SAYS DO IT.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, I want to go on now
[1:07:48] because I don't want nobody to feel like
[1:07:50] I'm, you know, on them or nothing.
[1:07:52] That's That's not right. That's not
[1:07:53] true. Don't let that thought come to
[1:07:55] your mind. We're one family.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when my children or
[1:08:01] someone Amen. like like trying to play
[1:08:03] the piano.
[1:08:05] That takes time. It takes skill. But if
[1:08:08] you stay with it, you'll become a
[1:08:10] professional player. That's all I'm
[1:08:13] saying. Don't give it up. Stay with it.
[1:08:17] Hallelujah. LET GOD INSTRUCT YOU.
[1:08:21] So it be done right.
[1:08:24] Let me move on. When it comes to the
[1:08:26] word
[1:08:28] and let me tell y'all, I I can't if
[1:08:33] Let me move on. Let me move on. I get on
[1:08:34] another track. Okay. NOW, HERE WE COME
[1:08:37] BY the grace of God.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And here is a woman, a prostitute
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; who KNOWS THAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, IS THE GOD of heaven
[1:08:52] and the GOD OF EARTH. NOW, HOW MANY OF
[1:08:55] YOU KNOW THAT?
[1:08:57] HOW MANY OF US KNOW THAT?
[1:09:00] I DIDN'T SAY IN YOUR HEAD
[1:09:04] BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW IT IN YOUR HEART
[1:09:08] HAS NO PLACE IN YOU.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THINK ABOUT IT. DAVID
[1:09:15] KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND WHEN GOLIATH WAS ON
[1:09:18] THE SCENE,
[1:09:21] Israel ran.
[1:09:23] But there was one man by the name of
[1:09:24] David.
[1:09:26] And even BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHERE
[1:09:27] IS MY LITTLE DAVID? Where is the people
[1:09:30] who HAVE FAITH AND KNOW THAT there's
[1:09:33] nothing, no weapon, no weapon, no
[1:09:38] weapon, NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU
[1:09:41] THAT SHOULD PROSPER." HALLELUJAH. GOD IN
[1:09:44] HIS OWN TIME WILL MAKE ALL THINGS
[1:09:47] BEAUTIFUL.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I believe that. It doesn't mean you're
[1:09:52] NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ROUGH TIMES.
[1:09:55] THAT'S PART OF THE JOURNEY.
[1:09:57] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN A PREACHER GET
[1:10:00] CRITICIZED,
[1:10:02] THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S PART OF THE
[1:10:04] JOURNEY.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I guarantee you, no preacher
[1:10:09] has gotten more criticized. Amen. Than
[1:10:11] William Brandham.
[1:10:14] Hallelujah. But he kept focused.
[1:10:17] Hallelujah. Listen, people of I want to
[1:10:20] say this and I want to sound like I'm
[1:10:21] proud,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; but I got right now, right now,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; churches, not just one church, churches
[1:10:31] that want me to leave here and come
[1:10:33] pastor there.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; So, I got a place to go, but I ain't
[1:10:39] going nowhere.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; I ain't going NOWHERE UNLESS GOD SHOW
[1:10:46] ME.
[1:10:48] HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT GOD SHOWED ME ABOUT
[1:10:50] THIS PLACE,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; IT SHALL COME TO PASS,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF WE GOT FIVE, 10, 15, IT
[1:11:00] DOESN'T MATTER ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE,
[1:11:03] BUT I KNOW GOD WILL REVIVE THIS GROUP.
[1:11:08] THERE'S COMING THE POWER OF GOD.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S HERE
[1:11:12] ALREADY. THE PROBLEM IS WE GOT TO
[1:11:16] RECOGNIZE
[1:11:17] WHAT IT IS.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE GOD LET you study this
[1:11:23] message for nothing. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE
[1:11:26] THERE'S A TIME WHEN that uh uh WORD MUST
[1:11:32] COME TO LIFE.
[1:11:34] You keep on reading. You keep on
[1:11:36] studying. HALLELUJAH. DON'T THINK GOD
[1:11:39] HAS DESERTED YOU.
[1:11:41] THERE'S ALWAYS A TIME,
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ALWAYS A PERIOD THAT GOD WILL
[1:11:47] enlighten us on what we need to do.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Let me turn to
[1:11:53] 1 Chronicles 29, please.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; We got to know more about this king.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't number one king. One king. Who's
[1:12:05] the king of kings?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] Amen. in 1st Chronicles 29
[1:12:12] 11:14
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and it reads starting at the 11th verse,
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the
[1:12:23] power and the glory and the victory
[1:12:27] and THE MAJESTY.
[1:12:29] FOR ALL that is is in the heaven and in
[1:12:33] the earth is thine. Thine is the
[1:12:35] kingdom, oh Lord. And thou shalt art
[1:12:38] exalted as head above all. Both riches
[1:12:43] and honor
[1:12:45] comes of thee. Hallelujah. Th reignth
[1:12:48] over all.
[1:12:50] And in THINE HAND IS POWER and might.
[1:12:54] And in thy hand it is to make great and
[1:12:57] TO GIVE STRENGTH UNTO ALL. Did you hear
[1:13:00] that? IT'S IN HIS HAND TO MAKE GREAT AND
[1:13:05] TO GIVE STRENGTH TO ALL. NOW THEREFORE
[1:13:08] our God, we thank THEE AND PRAISE THY
[1:13:13] GLORIOUS THING.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WORSHIP.
[1:13:17] THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHO GOD IS.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CUZ WHEN YOU KNOW WHO GOD
[1:13:24] IS, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TO WORSHIP HIM.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy. IT'S THE TRUTH. WE
[1:13:31] DON'T WORSHIP GOD.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ON A ON A JUSTIFIED LEVEL.
[1:13:37] HALLELUJAH. LUTHER, WE DON'T WORSHIP GOD
[1:13:40] on a westerly level. HALLELUJAH. WE
[1:13:43] DON'T WORSHIP GOD ON A PENTECOSTAL
[1:13:46] LEVEL. HALLELUJAH. OUR REVELATION IS
[1:13:49] HIGHER.
[1:13:51] Glory to God. WE WORSHIP GOD.
[1:13:54] HALLELUJAH. ON A HIGHER PLANE.
[1:13:57] IS THAT RIGHT? COME ON UP HERE, JOHN.
[1:14:00] I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT IS TO COME.
[1:14:03] NOT IS NOT GOD SHOWING YOU WHAT'S TO
[1:14:06] COME.
[1:14:08] WHAT A SECURITY. WHAT A SECURITY.
[1:14:12] SECURITY. HALLELUJAH. WHAT A RESTING
[1:14:15] PLACE. HALLELUJAH. NOT TO BE STRUGGLING
[1:14:19] ON WHETHER I'M SAVED OR NOT. NOT TO BE
[1:14:22] STRUGGLING on whether I'm going TO MAKE
[1:14:24] A RAPTURE OR NOT.
[1:14:26] THE KING HAS SPOKEN
[1:14:30] AND HIS WORDS CANNOT COME BACK FORTH.
[1:14:33] IF HE CALLS ME HOLY,
[1:14:35] he calls me holy. I'M HOLY. IF HE CALLS
[1:14:38] ME SANCTIFIED,
[1:14:40] I'M SANCTIFIED. IF HE CALLS ME PERFECT,
[1:14:45] HALLELUJAH, IT'S NOT BY MY MIGHT.
[1:14:49] MY SPIRIT IS BY HIS SPIRIT, SAYS THE
[1:14:51] LORD. MY POWER, NOT BY MIGHT, BUT his
[1:14:55] spirit. HALLELUJAH. HOW CAN YOU WORSHIP
[1:14:58] GOD WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE HIS SPIRIT?
[1:15:05] Not just in truth
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; because brother B say your doctrine
[1:15:09] could be completely right
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; but you don't have the correct spirit
[1:15:15] and there may be a brother who a problem
[1:15:17] with with his doctrine but he's got the
[1:15:19] right spirit.
[1:15:21] Hallelujah. I wonder which one God will
[1:15:24] accept.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we have gotten to a
[1:15:29] place,
[1:15:31] hallelujah, where we are so much into
[1:15:33] ourselves
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and not enough into Christ.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; You know, I didn't say Jesus,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; I said Christ.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a difference.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is the anointing
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the body.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; There's an anointing
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; that comes with this message.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And that anointing. There's an anointing
[1:16:02] of faith,
[1:16:04] NOT OF THOU FAITH.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to Glory to God.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:15] God is so real.
[1:16:17] And like I said, when you see
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; the glory of God, when you can see he's
[1:16:22] revealed to you who he is,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; you you can't help but to worship him.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the last scripture, the
[1:16:33] last little scripture to that
[1:16:36] 14th verse,
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; he said, "But who am I?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And what is my people?
[1:16:47] that we SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER SO
[1:16:49] WILLINGLY
[1:16:52] AFTER THIS SORT. FOR ALL THINGS COME OF
[1:16:55] THEE,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; and of thine own
[1:16:59] have we given thee. You ain't got
[1:17:03] nothing. YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING. CAN I
[1:17:06] SAY IT LIKE THAT AGAIN? YOU AIN'T GOT
[1:17:08] NOTHING.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. EVERYTHING YOU HAVE is
[1:17:13] God-given.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT SAY, "I'M SMARTER
[1:17:17] THAN BROTHER BROOKS.
[1:17:19] I'M NOT JEALOUS OF YOU." HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:22] BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE IS WHAT GOD GAVE
[1:17:25] YOU. HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE
[1:17:28] MONEY THAN ME. I'M NOT JEALOUS OF YOU. I
[1:17:32] DON'T WANT TO BE YOU. I'M SO GLAD TO BE
[1:17:35] ME. HALLELUJAH. WITH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS
[1:17:39] I GO THROUGH IN THIS FLESH,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; I never want to be you.
[1:17:45] I'm so grateful
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; to God for who he made me, what he made
[1:17:49] me. Y'all don't know where I come from,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; but I'm going tell you something. I God
[1:17:53] has brought me from a mighty long way,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; and he ain't through with me yet.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Whoa, Brother Brooks, what are
[1:18:05] you saying?"
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. Whether you
[1:18:08] realize it or not, when brother Brandham
[1:18:10] was here, that was not brother Brandon
[1:18:13] speaking.
[1:18:15] That was King Theophony.
[1:18:18] That was God himself.
[1:18:20] Amen. Wrapped in flesh.
[1:18:23] You couldn't see it. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU
[1:18:26] EYES TO SEE. BLESSED IS A MAN WHOM GOD
[1:18:30] HAS US TO SEE.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What you going to DO WITH
[1:18:34] IT?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T BE LIKE the days
[1:18:38] of Noah,
[1:18:40] knowing the prophecy
[1:18:42] and watching Noah build the ark
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; and you had no intentions on getting in
[1:18:48] it.
[1:18:50] YOU'RE NOT SAFE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS
[1:18:52] MESSAGE.
[1:18:54] YOU GOT TO GET INTO IT. YOU GOT TO LET
[1:18:58] HIM COME INTO YOU.
[1:19:01] OH, WE CAN SEE THE SIGN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ALL THE THINGS BROTHER BROWN
[1:19:05] HAS PROPHESIED, we see these things
[1:19:08] coming to pass,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; but that don't save you.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; THAT DON'T SAVE YOU. IT'S LIKE SEEING
[1:19:16] JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS.
[1:19:19] THAT DON'T SAVE YOU. IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU
[1:19:22] ASK HIM INTO YOUR LIFE, WHEN HE BECOMES
[1:19:25] A your life, WHEN HE BECOMES YOUR
[1:19:28] SAVIOR, WHEN HE BECOMES YOUR LORD, WHEN
[1:19:31] HE BECOMES YOUR KING,
[1:19:33] THE ONLY THING THAT SAVES YOU.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; have seen that Jesus was the Messiah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW he was THE SON OF GOD, but they
[1:19:45] never invited HIM IN. HALLELUJAH. BUT
[1:19:49] HERE THE WORD OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE
[1:19:51] BOOK OF REVELATION, HE SAID, "I STAND AT
[1:19:54] THE DOOR AND KNOCK AND ENEMY SHOULD OPEN
[1:19:57] UNTO ME. I WILL COME in unto him. I will
[1:20:01] supplement.
[1:20:04] You know WHAT THAT WORD SUPP MEANS? IT
[1:20:07] COMES FROM THE WORD SUPPER
[1:20:10] coming in the evening time
[1:20:13] unto me
[1:20:16] in fellowship with you.
[1:20:19] THAT MEANS HE'S NOT THERE IN HEAVEN.
[1:20:22] IN here
[1:20:24] in the king's chamber
[1:20:27] room is
[1:20:30] worshiing with you.
[1:20:32] Hallelujah. And I don't know about you.
[1:20:35] My God talks to me every day.
[1:20:40] Even when I do wrong,
[1:20:43] he doesn't get an attitude.
[1:20:46] He still speaks to me. He tells me I'm
[1:20:49] wrong. It tells me how I need to get it
[1:20:52] right.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; But every one of us, we hear the voice
[1:20:59] of God,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; but don't obey it.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And the more he tries to tell you right
[1:21:06] and you refuse to listen
[1:21:11] you, the closer you become or the closer
[1:21:14] you get to the danger zone.
[1:21:19] Isaiah 55, please.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Having his authority,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; we can't say, "Oh, we we're the we're
[1:21:28] the original."
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; You've heard me say this before. A close
[1:21:36] friend of mine, lives in Minnesota now.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He I think he's still there. He
[1:21:43] was a Baptist preacher. He came to our
[1:21:45] church one time. when we were in the
[1:21:47] other building.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Isaiah," he said, "I
[1:21:51] really believe that the Baptist is the
[1:21:54] closest to the truth
[1:21:57] than all all denominations."
[1:22:01] And excuse me, I had to laugh.
[1:22:04] And I did laugh
[1:22:06] and I said, "Friend,
[1:22:08] everybody believe that
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; the Catholic believe they're the
[1:22:11] closest.
[1:22:13] The Baptist believe they're the closest.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals believe they're the
[1:22:17] closest. Everybody believe they're the
[1:22:19] closest. Why do you think people go to
[1:22:21] their these different denominations?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Because it these denominations
[1:22:27] suits their taste.
[1:22:30] Hallelujah.
[1:22:31] Y'all understand me?
[1:22:34] Did Brother Brandon preach the message
[1:22:35] of thinking man's filter?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word of God is our
[1:22:40] filter.
[1:22:41] And whenever you try to convert anybody
[1:22:43] of another denomination,
[1:22:45] they're not going to take you through
[1:22:47] the word. They're going to take you
[1:22:49] through their filter. And if your word
[1:22:52] don't measure up to whatever doctrine
[1:22:54] they believe, they're going to call it
[1:22:57] false.
[1:22:59] Hallelujah. So you be careful.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; We do the same thing, don't we?
[1:23:05] Hallelujah. Let's say the appearing of
[1:23:07] Christ.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Everybody don't get it at the same time.
[1:23:12] Some of us get it at a later time than
[1:23:14] others. But what we do, we'll put
[1:23:18] somebody out of it because they don't
[1:23:21] have it like you got it.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hello. Well, Mary went to the tomb
[1:23:26] first.
[1:23:28] She saw the resurrected Lord first.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? Peter, James,
[1:23:34] and John,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; they saw him AFTER MARY. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT
[1:23:40] I'm saying? And then there were there
[1:23:42] were people like Thomas
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; who saw him last
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; the appearing
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; the coming.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Guess what? When Jesus came the first
[1:23:58] time,
[1:24:00] it was not Jews who saw him
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; first.
[1:24:08] You know, you say, "Well, what do you
[1:24:09] mean?" Let me break it down so you
[1:24:11] understand me. The three kings, they
[1:24:14] were not Jews,
[1:24:17] but they HAD A REVELATION. MAYBE those
[1:24:20] who were in the the shepherd in the
[1:24:21] field. Whatever revelation they did get.
[1:24:25] Hallelujah. It wasn't as strong as the
[1:24:28] ones that the Gentiles got.
[1:24:31] Is that right? They g brought gold,
[1:24:34] frankincense, and myrr.
[1:24:37] Hallelujah. A baby. You're going to
[1:24:40] bring a baby.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stuff that even pertain to
[1:24:44] death.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; These saw the death resurrection.
[1:24:51] The king.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? THEY WERE
[1:24:56] GENTILES.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; You people.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Us people.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Not correct English. BUT ANYWAY, YOU
[1:25:06] HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO A GENTILE FIRST.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? IT'S JUST IT'S JUST LIKE
[1:25:17] WHAT JESUS SAID to the Jews.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; THIS LADY WASN'T EVEN A JEW.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; This woman whom God met.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ELIJAH SAID, "AMEN. FIX ME
[1:25:30] THIS FIRST.
[1:25:33] HALLELUJAH. FIX IT FIRST.
[1:25:36] You give ME FIRST AND I'LL MAKE THE
[1:25:39] first the last or the last the first.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU GIVE ME FIRST and you'll
[1:25:45] never your oil will never run out.
[1:25:49] Your your meal WILL NEVER RUN OUT. Y'ALL
[1:25:51] HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? AND WE SERVE THE
[1:25:54] SAME GOD.
[1:25:56] WHEN A PROPHET SPEAKS,
[1:25:58] IT'S LIKE the king's word.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE A PROPHET IS AN
[1:26:04] AMBASSADOR.
[1:26:06] HE'S A REPRESENTATIVE.
[1:26:08] HE HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD. AND THE WORDS
[1:26:12] HE SPEAK IS NOT HIS OWN WORDS. SOMEBODY
[1:26:16] HELP ME HERE. IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S WHY
[1:26:19] WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD SAY, "THE
[1:26:22] LORD, you are healed." It wasn't him
[1:26:26] making up something. IT WAS GOD SPEAKING
[1:26:29] THROUGH HIM. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HE WAS SUCH A SPOKESMAN
[1:26:34] FROM GOD.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; God protected the gift.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; You couldn't just say anything to
[1:26:41] William Brandon
[1:26:43] and get away with it.
[1:26:45] Hallelujah. Many people were packed out
[1:26:48] dead
[1:26:50] in his meetings for disrespecting
[1:26:56] the king. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SEE WHAT THEY DIDN'T SEE.
[1:27:02] THEY SAW A LITTLE KUCKIAN.
[1:27:04] But behind the Kuckian
[1:27:07] was a king.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Not a king,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; but the king.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CANNOT BREAK IT DOWN TO US.
[1:27:16] THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T JUST TREAT EACH
[1:27:18] OTHER ANY KIND OF WAY.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M A KING,
[1:27:25] SON.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M NEXT IN LINE.
[1:27:31] THE INHERITANCE COME TO ME AND IT COMES
[1:27:33] TO YOU.
[1:27:36] JESUS OWNS
[1:27:40] for the taking,
[1:27:43] BUT he's not going to force it on you.
[1:27:46] Make you do it in that sense. IS THAT
[1:27:48] RIGHT? HE TOLD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,
[1:27:51] I'VE GIVEN YOU THE LAND, but you got TO
[1:27:54] FIGHT FOR IT.
[1:27:56] IT'S ALREADY YOURS. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M
[1:27:59] SAYING? YOUR blessings is already yours.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Now, some of y'all ain't going to
[1:28:05] believe it, but I'm going to tell you
[1:28:06] where I am. Even before I came to this
[1:28:09] message, I've had God talk to me and
[1:28:12] say, "I'm going to bless you with money.
[1:28:14] Today, he did it. I needed just a coin
[1:28:20] to make a phone call
[1:28:23] back in the day. I don't know how y'all
[1:28:25] phone uh things where you had to put a
[1:28:27] dime or quarter or whatever. It all
[1:28:30] depends on whether it was local or long
[1:28:32] distance. But I didn't have no change.
[1:28:35] And I says, "Lord, I need this to call
[1:28:37] this person
[1:28:39] because it's very important.
[1:28:41] I hate to say it, but the lady or the
[1:28:43] sister who was a witness of the the the
[1:28:46] great miracle,
[1:28:48] she's deceased now.
[1:28:50] But I stand before the Lord
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; out of the corner of of of a room.
[1:28:56] There was a light in that room. That
[1:28:59] light traveled toward me
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; and it and it and it and and it rolled
[1:29:04] around like that
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; and when it stopped, it was a coin.
[1:29:08] Amen. Now, you don't have to believe
[1:29:10] that, but I have to stand before God.
[1:29:15] Hallelujah.
[1:29:16] I used that coin to go call. I had to
[1:29:18] run down the streets to use the the
[1:29:21] phone. We didn't have cell phones then.
[1:29:24] Hallelujah. We had payoneses.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, payoneses weren't
[1:29:30] built for emergencies
[1:29:33] because sometimes you get to the pay
[1:29:34] phone. Somebody's in the phone booth.
[1:29:38] Hallelujah. You got to wait till they
[1:29:39] get out. But at that moment, nobody was
[1:29:43] in the phone booth.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying I've seen him do it.
[1:29:48] I've seen God multiply
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; bread and wine
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; in communion.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I got witnesses.
[1:29:58] I I can feel the unbelief. It doesn't
[1:30:00] matter.
[1:30:03] IT DOESN'T MATTER. I DON'T IT'S NOT
[1:30:05] ABOUT YOU. IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT, THEN
[1:30:08] I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD GONNA GIVE YOU.
[1:30:13] These are little things,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; you know, little things.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all have witnessed
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; here in here in this church?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Snowstorms. Come on.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Hurricanes,
[1:30:28] headed our way and God split them
[1:30:33] and and and it shows on the on the news.
[1:30:36] The storm splits and goes around
[1:30:38] anchoring
[1:30:41] Prayer
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; changes things.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T BELIEVE. We're
[1:30:47] just too scientific.
[1:30:50] WE JUST TOO KIND. WE GOT TO SEE.
[1:30:52] HALLELUJAH. GOD DIDN'T SAY SEE. HE SAID
[1:30:55] WE HAVE FAITH TO BELIEVE.
[1:30:57] And that's what we got to understand. We
[1:31:00] don't living IN A SCIENTIFIC WORLD.
[1:31:03] WE'RE IN IT BUT NOT OF IT.
[1:31:07] I I saw a sister down
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; there in in in in in at in at in at in
[1:31:10] at in at in at in at in at in at in at
[1:31:10] in brother Chad Lamb's church,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; our African sister.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. She can't she used to come to this
[1:31:17] church and she had been married
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; but couldn't have no children
[1:31:23] and she had been prayed for by VARIOUS
[1:31:26] MINISTERS.
[1:31:27] I'M NOT TOOTING MY HORN. I'M TELLING YOU
[1:31:30] THIS. WE PRAYED FOR HER AND SHE HAD
[1:31:34] TWINS.
[1:31:36] HALLELUJAH. AND SINCE THE TWIN, SHE GOT
[1:31:39] TWO OTHER BABIES. Guess what?
[1:31:42] WHEN I WAS DOWN THERE, SHE AND HER
[1:31:44] HUSBAND MADE IT TO ME AND SAID,
[1:31:47] "REMEMBER, BROTHER BROOKS? WHEN YOU
[1:31:49] PRAYED THAT GOD WOULD GIVE ME A BABY?
[1:31:53] HERE THEY ARE." HALLELUJAH. IT WASN'T
[1:31:56] ME. IT WAS JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT I'M
[1:31:59] TRYING TO TELL YOU. STOP LOOKING AT MY
[1:32:02] FAULTS.
[1:32:05] PREACHING.
[1:32:06] STOP LOOKING AT MY FAILURES.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; If you can hear THE WORD OF GOD,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU'LL GET YOUR BLESSING.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; GLORY. That's the truth.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not like those
[1:32:25] disciples.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the people say, "Well,
[1:32:29] Lord, why wasn't he able to cast out
[1:32:31] demons?"
[1:32:32] No, I have the faith of God. It ain't my
[1:32:35] faith. It's his faith.
[1:32:38] I have the faith of God. I didn't ask.
[1:32:41] He gave it to me. I have to beg for it.
[1:32:43] He gave it to me.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:48] That's the truth. People say, "Well, if
[1:32:51] you get two or three together
[1:32:53] in my in my name, in my I'll be in the
[1:32:56] midst."
[1:32:57] But he they talking about two or three
[1:32:58] believers.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Those who got the Holy Spirit in there.
[1:33:02] We got How many we got in here? But you
[1:33:04] see, it takes two to three believers.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit fil people.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me read this thing now. I'm
[1:33:13] sorry.
[1:33:17] Isaiah 55:8-13.
[1:33:21] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[1:33:25] neither are your ways my ways, sayeth
[1:33:28] the Lord.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; For as the heavens are higher than the
[1:33:32] earth,
[1:33:35] so are my ways higher than your ways
[1:33:38] and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[1:33:43] I'll say it like this. That's what
[1:33:45] brother Brandham said. He said, "If you
[1:33:46] don't believe, don't come up for prayer.
[1:33:50] Don't." and you don't get healed and
[1:33:51] then you blame the preacher.
[1:33:53] You didn't believe.
[1:33:58] For as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:34:00] from heaven and return it not thither,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; but water the earth,
[1:34:08] listen to this word, but water the earth
[1:34:11] and
[1:34:13] maketh,
[1:34:15] maketh, maketh. That means God makes it.
[1:34:19] It's God God working in the midst of it.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; It's God who's making it happen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; It brings forth bud.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CUZ WITHOUT GOD, YOU CAN'T
[1:34:31] BEAR no fruit.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; He is the vine
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; and we are the branches.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE A
[1:34:43] PART OF THE VINE.
[1:34:46] You being a branch
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; in the vine,
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; you have to bring forth fruit.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You say fruit.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about fruit of the spirit.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; You know a tree by the fruit it bear.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Don't be judging me."
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not. I'm looking at your fruit.
[1:35:18] your fruit talking to me.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; So shall my word wait a minute. And but
[1:35:28] it that it may give seed to the swer and
[1:35:30] bread to the eater.
[1:35:34] So it doesn't it doesn't stop just at
[1:35:37] the budding of the seed. It actually the
[1:35:39] seed itself bring forth fruit.
[1:35:45] so that you can eat it.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So shall my word be that
[1:35:50] goeth out of my mouth. It shall not
[1:35:53] return unto me void,
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:35:57] please
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; and it shall prosper in the things there
[1:36:02] whereto I sent it.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; The king has spoken.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to prosper.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. How many of you have
[1:36:14] ever been down and you thought there was
[1:36:17] no way up
[1:36:18] and God in all of your despair when you
[1:36:21] shouldn't be despairing,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; he he brought you up anyway.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; YES. EVERY TRIAL YOU GO THROUGH IS A
[1:36:32] TEST. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN I SAY IT LIKE
[1:36:35] WORSHIP GOD. IF YOU WORSHIP GOD IN YOUR
[1:36:39] TRIAL,
[1:36:41] PRAYERS, how quick he delivers you.
[1:36:45] I've seen IT DONE. I DON'T WORRY ABOUT
[1:36:48] THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE
[1:36:50] BECAUSE I'M NOT THE CHANGER. BUT GOD
[1:36:53] CHANGES. IS THAT RIGHT? THE BIBLE SAID
[1:36:56] HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD ACTUALLY
[1:36:58] change time.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; You say he doesn't change time. He did
[1:37:05] in Joshua day. Hallelujah. Joshua say
[1:37:08] stand still
[1:37:10] and the son stood still.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHERE DID THAT TIME GO? SO
[1:37:17] THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. HALLELUJAH. GOD
[1:37:20] WILL WORK ON YOUR BEHALF.
[1:37:23] HE WILL WORK with you.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's true. I I just believe that.
[1:37:31] I've seen it.
[1:37:33] And you know, I'm I'm I'm declaring God
[1:37:36] is who he say he is.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[1:37:45] I've suffered so much.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "These light afflictions
[1:37:51] ain't nothing.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Light affliction.
[1:37:57] I can't understand it. You you got a
[1:37:59] feather on your back
[1:38:02] and you're carrying on like you got a
[1:38:03] big load.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:06] IS that right?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; IN THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE SAND OF TIME.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD SAYS, "LORD, HOW
[1:38:13] COME IT'S JUST ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS?"
[1:38:16] He said, "IT'S ONLY ONE SET OF
[1:38:18] FOOTPRINTS
[1:38:20] BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME I WAS CARRYING
[1:38:22] YOU. If you CAN'T WALK ANY LONGER, LET
[1:38:25] GOD CARRY YOU.
[1:38:31] THERE'S NO SHAME in that.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; No shame.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You fall and you stump your toe or break
[1:38:40] your leg.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you want somebody to carry you?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; They say walk. You say, "Well, I can't
[1:38:48] walk." When you say, "I can't walk," you
[1:38:51] say, "Can you carry?"
[1:38:54] Maybe y'all don't know what I'm talking
[1:38:55] about, but I know what it is.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; You know, I keep looking around. I I
[1:39:00] look at the whole scope
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; because by doing so, I can see
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; where the word is really falling and
[1:39:08] really affecting you,
[1:39:11] you know,
[1:39:12] I'm I'm I'm a little spiritual a little
[1:39:14] bit
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; that what he give me, I try to use it.
[1:39:20] You know, I just felt like God said to
[1:39:23] me this morning.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; You know, this service should be a
[1:39:28] service of rejoicing.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hammer you or beat you
[1:39:33] down. I'm trying to encourage you. I'm
[1:39:37] trying to tell you what God thinks of
[1:39:39] you and what you need to think of God.
[1:39:42] Because if you don't see God for who he
[1:39:45] is, you'll never see who you are.
[1:39:49] Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; One thing about my children, they all
[1:39:52] look alike.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Same kind of head, everything.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; More look more look more like my wife
[1:40:02] than me.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; If you you wouldn't looking at them, you
[1:40:06] wouldn't have to wonder whose child that
[1:40:07] is.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; That's the way it's supposed to be with
[1:40:11] God.
[1:40:13] The character of Christ is supposed to
[1:40:15] reflect so much out of us that people
[1:40:17] will not mistaken us for somebody else's
[1:40:19] child.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you MUST DETERMINE WHOSE
[1:40:23] CHILD ARE YOU.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I BELONG to Jesus.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let me hurry because I'm
[1:40:35] I'm I'm I'm talking too much. Forgive
[1:40:38] me. But let me move on by the grace of
[1:40:40] God.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Listen what he goes on to say. So shall
[1:40:46] my word be that goeth out of my mouth.
[1:40:49] It shall not return unto me void,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:40:55] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:40:59] things whether to I sent it.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:41:04] PROSPERING,
[1:41:05] YOU NEED TO SEARCH YOURSELF.
[1:41:08] SEE WHETHER YOU BE IN the faith.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz all the our suffering we go through,
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; let's take it back back some years.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; None of us are being burned at the
[1:41:21] stake.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; You're not getting your head chopped
[1:41:24] off.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Actually, Brother Brandham
[1:41:27] said that our greatest enemy in this age
[1:41:30] is easy living.
[1:41:33] That's your problem. You can't pray. You
[1:41:36] can't fast. You can't read. is because
[1:41:38] you got it too good.
[1:41:41] And sometime when you got it too good,
[1:41:44] if you are the true sons and daughters
[1:41:46] of God, he going to look at your
[1:41:48] situation
[1:41:50] and he going to say, "Hey, I need you to
[1:41:52] pray more."
[1:41:54] And you say, "Well, Lord, I'm going to
[1:41:55] get there." You keep telling him, "I'm
[1:41:57] going to get there." It's like telling
[1:41:58] one of these kids, "Go clean your room."
[1:42:02] Oh, I'm going.
[1:42:04] I'm going. And sometimes you have to get
[1:42:06] a belt
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; and direct them to their room.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Direct them to their room. You know what
[1:42:13] I'm saying? Cuz they don't get it when
[1:42:15] it's soft and easy.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God has to come down and
[1:42:21] spank you.
[1:42:24] DON'T GET MAD AT GOD. YOU DID IT. YOU
[1:42:27] WON'T LISTEN.
[1:42:30] IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE STUBBORN OR
[1:42:31] HARDHEADED.
[1:42:34] WHEN MY MOM used to whoop me,
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; you know why? When she would hit me
[1:42:38] every lick,
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; you just so hard hit. Hardhead.
[1:42:43] Hardhead.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of y'all don't know what I'm
[1:42:47] talking about. BUT LITERALLY TELL YOU
[1:42:50] WHAT YOU DID WRONG.
[1:42:52] AND BECAUSE OF YOUR HARDHEAD AND YOUR
[1:42:54] STUBBORNNESS, YOUR SUFFERING,
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; you got to turn back to God.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; God trying to get your attention.
[1:43:02] Halle Oh, come on, somebody. Oh, I know
[1:43:05] I'm hitting the right area now.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah. God trying to get your
[1:43:10] attention.
[1:43:11] HE WAS CHASING THOSE WHOM HE LOVES. IT'S
[1:43:14] A PROOF that he loves you.
[1:43:17] It's so late in the evening now.
[1:43:22] People, oh, I got to go do
[1:43:25] I mean, you you're working the scripture
[1:43:28] called to the wedding supper
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and now you got to go find You you you
[1:43:32] busy doing everything else.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Have mercy, Jesus. Yeah.
[1:43:39] Let's move on. Let me read this. Finish
[1:43:40] up this.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I know it's a little bit after 12, but
[1:43:44] it's okay. For ye shall go out with joy
[1:43:48] and be led forth with peace.
[1:43:51] The mountains and the hills shall break
[1:43:53] forth before you into singing,
[1:43:57] and all the trees of THE FIELD SHALL
[1:43:59] CLAP THEIR HANDS.
[1:44:01] You hear what I'm saying? AND YOU GET
[1:44:03] PEOPLE IN CHURCH, EVERYBODY CLAPPING
[1:44:06] their hands, and you WON'T EVEN MOVE
[1:44:08] YOUR HAND.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHETHER WHAT YOUR REVELATION
[1:44:12] IS.
[1:44:14] WHO ARE YOU WORSHIPING?
[1:44:16] Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? HE SAID,
[1:44:18] "TREES, WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU ARE
[1:44:21] A TREE. AND IF YOU GOT THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:44:24] YOU ARE A TREE OF LIFE."
[1:44:29] Instead of thorns shall come up the fire
[1:44:32] far fire tree fur tree
[1:44:35] and instead of brier shall come up the
[1:44:37] merl tree.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; So if you got thorns and you got briars.
[1:44:44] Amen. Somehow you in the wrong
[1:44:46] atmosphere.
[1:44:48] Hallelujah. Cuz stickers come by way of
[1:44:51] no moisture. You haven't been in the
[1:44:53] spirit of the Holy Spirit for a long
[1:44:55] time. The presence of the Holy Spirit a
[1:44:58] long time.
[1:44:59] You love the Lord. Let me finish this
[1:45:01] now. All right. And it shall be to the
[1:45:03] Lord for a name,
[1:45:05] an everlasting sign that shall not be
[1:45:08] cut out.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What are you saying? I'm a
[1:45:13] sign.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And what sign am I?
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; I'm a blessed sign.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; So are you.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Blessed.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I told you that brother
[1:45:27] bought me that car.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; He bought it,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; FINISHED IT OFF JUST LIKE HE said he
[1:45:34] would.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying
[1:45:43] when you trust God
[1:45:46] AND PEOPLE I DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM FOR A
[1:45:47] NEW CAR.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WAS FIXING UP MY MY OLD
[1:45:51] one
[1:45:54] over and over AND OVER.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD PUT ON THAT
[1:45:59] brother's heart.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I almost want to cut
[1:46:04] it off. But 36,000
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; one shot. Y'all understand? Because
[1:46:10] y'all heard the testimony.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] I'm just saying
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; I know he loves me
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; and I know he loves the Lord. Come on.
[1:46:27] Cuz if you love the Lord, that's the
[1:46:29] only thing.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that'll make you
[1:46:33] do THAT IS WHEN YOU LOVE THE LORD AND
[1:46:36] YOU CAN HEAR HIS VOICE.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I know that's right. That's right.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all heard my testimony
[1:46:46] when God said,
[1:46:48] "Give that give that brother $50."
[1:46:51] I said, "Lord," I said, "Lord, that's
[1:46:53] all I have."
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And God said, "But that's all I ask you
[1:46:57] for."
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And from that $50, he gave me 500 in the
[1:47:03] mail by a sister I DIDN'T KNOW AND STILL
[1:47:06] DON'T KNOW.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying that's how he works with
[1:47:12] me. And I believe I'm no I'm no special
[1:47:15] person. God will do the same for you.
[1:47:19] If you let go and let God, I'm telling
[1:47:20] you, I'm telling you, I'm serving a God
[1:47:24] of prosperity
[1:47:27] both spiritually and naturally. I'm
[1:47:29] telling you, but he needs somebody to
[1:47:31] trust.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; We we always quote the woman, you know,
[1:47:37] in Elijah,
[1:47:39] but that woman had to put trust
[1:47:43] in the words that Elijah spoke.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell y'all something.
[1:47:48] CAN I SAY IT LIKE THIS? WHEN I GO BEFORE
[1:47:51] GOD,
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I SAY, LORD, you promise.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; God loves that. He loves it. When you
[1:47:58] take his word and you come before him
[1:48:00] and say, "But you promise, Lord."
[1:48:04] And when you operate like that,
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; God will.
[1:48:10] Now you got the problem is with us. If
[1:48:13] you got a if you got a problem with
[1:48:14] patience,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; he going to have you wait a little bit.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that all right?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; It's in you to you. It's in you to wait.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; If you were in Abraham, you can wait 25
[1:48:30] years. Abraham,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; but it's in you to wait. Now, I'm
[1:48:35] enjoying JESUS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW.
[1:48:37] I'M NOT LAUGHING AT NOBODY. I'm enjoying
[1:48:40] the anointing that I feel right now is
[1:48:42] there's a joy in my soul and that's what
[1:48:45] I'm enjoying. So, let me move on because
[1:48:47] I
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; don't be r don't be in a hurry to rush.
[1:48:50] It's cold out there.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; For the Lord most high is terrible for
[1:48:57] he is a great king over all the earth.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; That's I uh Psalms 47. Did I say
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Psalm 47? I'm sorry. 1-9. I I I started
[1:49:08] and did I'm going to start with one.
[1:49:11] Clap your hands
[1:49:13] all ye people.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Shout unto God with a voice of triumph.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Now we're coming here. Oh, we coming to
[1:49:24] see God.
[1:49:26] Everybody's so so sad. Your head your
[1:49:30] head hung down and you don't even you
[1:49:33] don't even have a phone in your hand.
[1:49:37] Usually you have an excuse,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; but you don't even have a phone in your
[1:49:41] head.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; The devil, Mhm. I got him. Just exactly
[1:49:47] where I want it.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz you ain't got no strength cuz the
[1:49:51] joy of the Lord is your strength.
[1:49:54] Hallelujah. Y'all don't know how to
[1:49:55] encourage yourself in the Lord. Maybe
[1:49:58] I'm THE ONLY ONE.
[1:50:00] SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CAN'T GET NOBODY TO
[1:50:02] WORSHIP WITH YOU, PUT SOME MUSIC IN THE
[1:50:05] HOUSE.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You know, YOU STOMP THE
[1:50:10] DEVIL a little bit.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; You got to DO SOMETHING. SOMETIMES YOU
[1:50:16] HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING in motion
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; in order to get something.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Don't think it's for not.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Don't think it's for not.
[1:50:29] Don't think it's for nothing.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I can't get that English pronunciation.
[1:50:34] N
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; anyhow,
[1:50:39] when we see by the grace of God, I was
[1:50:42] told I was told, and I know I'm going
[1:50:45] off on this, but I was told that the
[1:50:46] flutter of a butterfly
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; wings
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; can start a tornado,
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; a hurricane, excuse me, a hurricane. I
[1:50:58] don't know how they came up with that,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; but it must be a special butterfly.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; And if that be true, think about it. One
[1:51:10] little motion
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; rains on a horrific storm.
[1:51:18] So let me say it like this. Your prayers
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; are not just a thdimensional prayer.
[1:51:29] And though Satan can hinder you, your
[1:51:33] prayer, he can't stop it.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Daniel,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; you prayed. It's been 21 days. But we
[1:51:43] heard you the first time you prayed.
[1:51:48] Don't think God can't hear you. That if
[1:51:50] you think God don't hear you, God hears
[1:51:52] you.
[1:51:55] And uh so understand Satan may be
[1:51:57] holding it, but he can't stop it.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; He just tried to bring you closer,
[1:52:03] closer, closer. You trust me and I'll
[1:52:06] trust you.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The voice of triumph.
[1:52:14] I love that. I love that because well, I
[1:52:17] can truly say
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; our song service has gotten better when
[1:52:21] it comes to the voice.
[1:52:25] And so therefore we growing in that
[1:52:27] somehow the praises of God is becoming
[1:52:30] more heartfelt
[1:52:33] than just traditional
[1:52:36] for the Lord most high is terrible. That
[1:52:39] means powerful. He is a great king over
[1:52:43] all the earth.
[1:52:46] He shall subdue the people under us.
[1:52:50] Hello. He shall subdue the people under
[1:52:53] us.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; And the nations under our feet.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT TOMORROW.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT YESTERDAY.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; This is today.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Y'all, I I tell you another testimony.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; I wasn't even in this message when I was
[1:53:18] a Christian.
[1:53:21] you know, and and and and and
[1:53:23] I was the comproller, the head of the uh
[1:53:26] accounting department
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; working working for the uh Ramada in
[1:53:35] I was a head of the hotel as well as the
[1:53:37] restaurant.
[1:53:41] But because of who I was,
[1:53:43] I had a lot of opposition.
[1:53:47] And Satan worked some things that I
[1:53:50] didn't see him working.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; But I made a com comment
[1:53:56] that was taken back to the the owner of
[1:54:00] the hotel.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; He was making changes in the restaurant.
[1:54:06] And I thought that that his changes
[1:54:09] would cause a problem with
[1:54:13] certain uh
[1:54:15] um kind of people.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; So anyway, to make a long story short,
[1:54:20] he got the message.
[1:54:23] He came to my job.
[1:54:26] He literally cursed me out.
[1:54:30] I mean there was nothing I could say to
[1:54:33] defend myself because what I said had
[1:54:36] been twisted.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; God is my witness.
[1:54:43] Three months, four months. I don't know
[1:54:46] how long it had been. And that was a
[1:54:49] time when I didn't know to pray for
[1:54:51] people. See, when people when people
[1:54:53] offend you, you
[1:54:56] you don't understand they're in danger
[1:54:57] zones.
[1:54:59] And if you don't pray for them, God has
[1:55:01] a way of dealing with them.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't know that that time because I
[1:55:06] loved this man. I loved him. He was this
[1:55:09] man saw me when I was just out of
[1:55:12] college,
[1:55:14] you know, trying to find my way out
[1:55:17] through life.
[1:55:19] I was riding a little beat up car
[1:55:23] and and he saw my car out there and
[1:55:25] said, "Who car is this
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; in front of my hotel?"
[1:55:30] Cuz it was one of those kind of hotels.
[1:55:32] He said, "Oh, no, no, no, no. You can't
[1:55:34] work here and park that kind of car in
[1:55:36] front of my hotel."
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; You know what that man did? Now, this
[1:55:41] may not sound like a lot of money to
[1:55:42] you,
[1:55:44] but in that in that time, that man gave
[1:55:47] me a $30,000 raise.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was able to buy my first
[1:55:55] house
[1:55:57] and my first new car.
[1:56:01] So, I really was attached to this man.
[1:56:04] He never asked me for nothing.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Back in the day when my brain was a
[1:56:08] little more sharper,
[1:56:11] I would watch them come and fix the
[1:56:13] computers.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And I saved that man lots of money.
[1:56:19] I saved him lots of money
[1:56:22] cuz when the computer would go down, I
[1:56:24] would go in and redo it.
[1:56:27] Reboot it, re whatever.
[1:56:31] And so what I'm what I'm saying is
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; three months or four months
[1:56:37] after that the man fell to a stroke,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; lost his whole business
[1:56:47] and he died.
[1:56:50] You said, "Brother Brooks, that had
[1:56:51] nothing to do with you." Maybe,
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; but I think it did.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that's the way it is
[1:57:00] with every son and daughter of God.
[1:57:03] I'm not weak.
[1:57:05] I'm careful.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Y'all heard what I said.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; I said I'm not weak. I'm careful.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Because you don't never know who is who.
[1:57:18] And what God is doing with people.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? And I said
[1:57:24] all of that and that's way off my
[1:57:26] subject,
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; but I said that to uh
[1:57:30] bring us to this point.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read another quote and then
[1:57:38] I'll let you go.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I'm jumping here a little bit, but
[1:57:42] that's okay.
[1:57:49] You know, when I see by the grace of God
[1:57:54] an ambassador because that's what we
[1:57:56] are. Paul said we are the ambassadors of
[1:57:58] Christ.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; We have no word of our own.
[1:58:05] But the word that we have is authority.
[1:58:11] And an ambassador is the highest ranking
[1:58:14] diplomat
[1:58:17] or representing representing their
[1:58:20] government in a foreign country.
[1:58:25] or to an international organization
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; acting as the official messenger
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; and representative for their nation's
[1:58:34] history.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, what do you mean,
[1:58:40] Brother Bruce?"
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:58:44] and you got to believe this.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; But you see, if you don't read your
[1:58:48] word, I'm trying to tell you.
[1:58:51] The Bible said, "Let this mind be in you
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; that was also in Christ Jesus."
[1:58:58] Stop thinking about what you used to be.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; You're no longer what you used to be.
[1:59:08] And the devil keep coming to your mind.
[1:59:10] This is trying to identify you with the
[1:59:12] past.
[1:59:15] But don't you believe the Bible said if
[1:59:17] you if you uh uh confess with your mouth
[1:59:20] and believe with with your heart,
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, you pass from death unto
[1:59:25] life.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Then your old man
[1:59:29] is dead.
[1:59:31] I'm sorry that we have to carry this old
[1:59:33] dead flesh around with us. He's always
[1:59:36] on us.
[1:59:38] We we basically stuck to him.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BUT PAUL SAID, "KILL HIM.
[1:59:44] DON'T SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; OH, the devil say, "Oh, remember when?"
[1:59:49] No, no, no, no, no. You talking to the
[1:59:51] wrong man.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I know remember when.
[1:59:56] HELLO. DON'T REMEMBER WHEN.
[2:00:00] You either NEW CREATURE OR YOU'RE NOT.
[2:00:03] AND IF YOU'RE NOT A NEW CREATURE, become
[2:00:04] one.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look what Brother Brham says here.
[2:00:13] for him will I accept
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; message uh 52 I don't I don't have the
[2:00:20] paragraph but he said just as if the
[2:00:23] president of the United States
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; would make me an ambassador to Germany
[2:00:30] my words then in Germany
[2:00:34] would be just exactly what the president
[2:00:37] told me to say
[2:00:42] if If I said them
[2:00:45] what he told me to say,
[2:00:48] then everything that's in the United
[2:00:50] States
[2:00:52] is behind them words.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; So, let me say it like this. Everything
[2:00:58] in heaven
[2:01:02] and in earth is behind the word.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; You are encompassed about
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; with so great a cloud of witnesses.
[2:01:13] You know, I I want to say amen to those
[2:01:16] of you who have fallen like Samson.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; GET UP.
[2:01:23] REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE YOU SINCE
[2:01:28] YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT ATMOSPHERE, BUT IT
[2:01:30] AIN'T ALL OVER YET.
[2:01:34] God is not through WITH YOU.
[2:01:37] OH, I'VE DONE THIS. I'VE DONE THAT.
[2:01:41] WHAT?
[2:01:42] THE BLOOD OF JESUS COVERS IT ALL.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; HE PAID YOUR DEBT.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; HE PAID MY DEBT.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WANT TO SEE YOU IN
[2:01:52] ACTION.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. YOU DON'T WANT
[2:01:56] TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. But
[2:01:59] you don't mind the devil using your
[2:02:00] body.
[2:02:04] You he one or the other. It's either GOD
[2:02:07] USING YOU OR THE DEVIL USING YOU.
[2:02:11] HALLELUJAH. AND EVERYTHING GOD WANTS
[2:02:13] FROM YOU,
[2:02:15] THE DEVIL WANTS from you.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But most of the time, THE
[2:02:21] DEVIL GETS IT.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SUPPOSED to be giving to God.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY HE SAID, "CHOOSE
[2:02:30] YOU THIS DAY. Who you going to serve?
[2:02:34] CHOOSE THE SIDE YOU GO ON, WHO YOU'RE
[2:02:37] GOING TO STAND WITH."
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You know, you got people I'm
[2:02:43] closing cuz I keep going.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; You got people in the message. You know,
[2:02:48] you got this side, oh, you don't quote
[2:02:49] brother enough.
[2:02:53] And this side say you quote him too
[2:02:55] much.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; And then there's another one say, "Oh,
[2:02:58] you say brother Brandham names too
[2:02:59] much."
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:03:08] Man, if I was pleasing you,
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; I'd be one confused person.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; But you got to understand, a preacher
[2:03:17] has to be led by the Holy Spirit.
[2:03:21] And let me say it like this. If you're
[2:03:23] in this day
[2:03:26] questioning the position William
[2:03:28] Brandham had,
[2:03:30] you need to get on your knees
[2:03:33] and say, "Lord, show me. reveal to me
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; who Malachi 4 is,
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; who William Brandham is, BECAUSE PEOPLE
[2:03:42] DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY understand the
[2:03:43] authority of the message.
[2:03:45] THE AUTHORITY OF THE MESSAGE is
[2:03:49] you don't have a word to say.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; You don't have an opinion on this.
[2:03:56] That's why we got so many crazies.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; So many crazies.
[2:04:04] Every man want to have a kingdom.
[2:04:06] There ain't one kingdom
[2:04:09] and that's the kingdom of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:11] Christ. Hallelujah. William Brandom
[2:04:14] worked for that kingdom.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; I'm working for that kingdom.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I don't believe
[2:04:20] everything brother Brandham said.
[2:04:23] The bride does.
[2:04:25] Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's all I can tell you.
[2:04:28] And those things that seem to be
[2:04:30] controversial,
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; God normally reveals it to them
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; or they don't they don't bother with it.
[2:04:37] They just move on.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's words in in the English
[2:04:44] uh vocabulary.
[2:04:47] If you would speak it,
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; I would have no idea what you
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But then God brings it down
[2:04:56] simple in a simple way.
[2:05:00] Isaiah said even a fool won't air.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; So a man who don't believe that this
[2:05:07] message is right.
[2:05:10] Does that make him a fool or worse?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; No. I let them answer that question.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; You know it's like looking at the boat
[2:05:19] that Noah built and there was Noah.
[2:05:24] Let me examine this thing.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; I don't think it's going to flow.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; But the boat was built by God.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; No, it was just a hands that God used.
[2:05:38] Y'all understand me? Hallelujah. This
[2:05:40] ark is built by God.
[2:05:43] William Brand was God's instrument. He
[2:05:45] just used
[2:05:47] Hallelujah. And so you understand you.
[2:05:50] You are the the the instruments God want
[2:05:53] to use.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Is it hard?
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; It better be
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; because you've chosen the harder way.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; When things come too easy, you are you
[2:06:06] need to watch it.
[2:06:09] Every time you think it's good, so
[2:06:11] sweet,
[2:06:14] here come that little grasshopper. He
[2:06:16] going to eat you. Eat whatever you done
[2:06:18] built up.
[2:06:20] Hallelujah.
[2:06:22] You love the Lord. Be encouraged.
[2:06:26] Don't Don't let the devil put you down
[2:06:28] and got you on his feet.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; You ain't the only one that needs to pay
[2:06:33] bills.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something.
[2:06:38] I've been homeless. I've been homeless.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; But God, I survived.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; When my mother died, there was nobody
[2:06:47] that wanted to take me in. not even my
[2:06:49] family.
[2:06:51] And if I didn't have a a college to go
[2:06:53] to, I would have been out there.
[2:06:57] Thank God to the scholarship that I had.
[2:07:00] Amen. I was able to go to Colorado and I
[2:07:02] had a living place
[2:07:04] and go to school and be paid.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Say, "My God ain't a provider."
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, somebody. Y'all don't know what I'm
[2:07:15] talking about, but I know what I'm
[2:07:17] talking about.
[2:07:18] God will always supply your need.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; You trust God. Trust God. Trust God.
[2:07:24] Trust God. You know, my friend, my
[2:07:27] closest friend, I'm I'm trying to sit
[2:07:29] down now and I want some I want come up
[2:07:32] with some singing, brother. Where where
[2:07:33] the song leader at? We going to worship
[2:07:35] this morning. And everybody that got to
[2:07:38] go, you can go.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; But we going to sing some victory songs
[2:07:42] and we going to worship
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; and uh we going to let God know how much
[2:07:46] we appreciate him.
[2:07:49] Hallelujah. But my closest friend, um,
[2:07:52] we've been friends ever since fifth
[2:07:53] grade. He's in the message.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; His family is, I mean, you know, some of
[2:07:59] them not living right like mine.
[2:08:03] But one thing for certain, this this
[2:08:04] friend of mine, we never had an
[2:08:06] argument,
[2:08:07] a fall out.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; The one time I told him, I saw him sassy
[2:08:13] his mother.
[2:08:16] I saw my friend sassy his mother
[2:08:22] and I told him if you going to remain my
[2:08:24] friend don't let me ever hear you sassy
[2:08:27] your mom
[2:08:31] and as far as I know of he never did it
[2:08:33] again.
[2:08:35] Oh, I don't believe in that.
[2:08:37] I don't care if they let you know you
[2:08:40] don't sassy mama and you don't sassy
[2:08:42] daddy.
[2:08:46] Young, that ain't cute. That's ugly.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's demonic.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; And you
[2:08:55] spare the rod, spoil the child.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Let me tell y'all.
[2:09:01] Let me tell y'all something. My mother
[2:09:04] used to tell me. If you don't whip that
[2:09:06] child,
[2:09:08] when it grows up, it's going to whip
[2:09:09] you.
[2:09:13] We see these babies
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; hitting their parents think, "Oh, they
[2:09:17] too little to think." What?
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Take that pamper down.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to beat it to death.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; But you got to let that child know this
[2:09:28] is not acceptable.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all, I'm telling y'all, some of these
[2:09:34] little kids are cursing.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; What? Brothers,
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; no. Nobody told me. I heard it myself.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; And I know they were so terrified. They
[2:09:47] thought I was going to tell you.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; But my point is, no, no, no. You knew
[2:09:52] you were wrong. You make right.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Parents can't keep up with all their
[2:09:59] kids. Let me let me stop. Let me stop.
[2:10:02] But my point is, my point is people of
[2:10:04] God, if they you know you love your
[2:10:07] children,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; spank your children
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; and give them a good hug.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Let them know how much you love them
[2:10:16] afterwards.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; You might have them confused for a bit,
[2:10:22] but as they grow up and mature, they're
[2:10:23] going to understand what you did was the
[2:10:25] right thing.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:30] I don't care how cute. No, no, no. You
[2:10:33] ain't cute.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; My children might say I whooped them too
[2:10:38] much.
[2:10:41] Maybe I did. I don't know. I always tell
[2:10:44] them I don't remember.
[2:10:49] But you know after learning this message
[2:10:53] I I because before the message I did
[2:10:55] whip him in anger.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Anybody whip you? Have you ever done it?
[2:11:00] Oh yeah. Come on.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; I'mma stop.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; But everyone every one of my kids as
[2:11:08] they grown up, I've asked them if
[2:11:10] there's anything in your lives that I've
[2:11:12] done wrong that I need to apologize.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; They'll tell you every one of my
[2:11:17] children.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; I have apologized
[2:11:23] because sometime parents we think we're
[2:11:25] right when we're wrong.
[2:11:28] And ain't nothing wrong with confessing
[2:11:30] to your children and asking for their
[2:11:32] forgiveness
[2:11:33] because really as long as they got that
[2:11:36] there, they can't go any further. You
[2:11:38] hindering them from moving on in God.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; So I tell my children, "Yeah, I'm sorry.
[2:11:45] Did you whip me in anger?" "Yeah, I
[2:11:47] whipped you in anger." And I found out
[2:11:49] that I was wrong.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:11:57] One more thing.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; I'll just say this. By the gra I'm
[2:12:00] walking off.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Teenagers
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; are very difficult to deal with.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Now that I better understand them, I
[2:12:09] would I would handle my children
[2:12:10] different.
[2:12:15] But one of my boys as he grew up,
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; you know how they get in your face?
[2:12:25] One of my boys got in my faith
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; and before I knew it, I had him like
[2:12:31] this.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian,
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; but he punched the wrong button.
[2:12:40] And I don't know where the strength came
[2:12:42] from, but I grabbed him and I lift him
[2:12:44] above my head like that.
[2:12:47] I ain't gonna tell you the rest.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; But by God's grace, I repented
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; and asked the Lord to forgive me.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you something.
[2:12:58] I disrespect from children. I just can't
[2:13:01] handle that. Not from my children,
[2:13:04] nobody else.
[2:13:06] You love the Lord.
[2:13:09] Y'all teach these kids right. I'm
[2:13:10] telling you words of wisdom.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Give us the songs, brother. We
[2:13:16] going to praise the Lord. For those who
[2:13:18] want to praise the Lord, if there
[2:13:19] anybody here that needs prayer,
[2:13:39] The power of God is in the name of Jesus
[2:13:41] Christ. And Lord, we thank you.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:10] I mean, we have a few important
[2:14:12] announcements to make after we're done
[2:14:13] singing. So, if you can stay, hang back
[2:14:16] so we can announce it. We can stand up
[2:14:17] on our feet and sing this song. When the
[2:14:19] saints go marching in.
[2:14:26] Oh, when the saints
[2:14:30] go marching in.
[2:14:34] Oh, when the saints go maring
[2:14:38] in.
[2:14:41] Oh Lord, I want
[2:14:44] to be in that number.
[2:14:49] Oh, when the saints go maring
[2:14:54] in.
[2:14:56] Oh, I'm a p
[2:14:59] grim man, a stranger,
[2:15:04] wandering through
[2:15:06] this world of sin.
[2:15:11] I'm on my way
[2:15:14] to that fair city.
[2:15:19] Oh, when the saints go maring
[2:15:24] in.
[2:15:26] Oh, when the saints
[2:15:30] go maring in.
[2:15:34] For when the saints go maring
[2:15:39] in,
[2:15:42] Lord, I want to be in that number.
[2:15:49] Oh, when the saints go maring
[2:15:54] in.
[2:15:57] Oh, I know I'll share my savior.
[2:16:04] If my life
[2:16:06] is free from sin,
[2:16:11] all heaven's door
[2:16:14] will open
[2:16:16] for me.
[2:16:18] Oh, when the saints go maring
[2:16:23] in.
[2:16:26] Oh, when the saints
[2:16:30] go maring in.
[2:16:33] Oh, when the saints go maring

[2:17:03] to swing low
[2:17:06] and I'll step.
[2:17:10] Oh, on the clouds
[2:17:13] I'll ride up to heaven.
[2:17:18] When the saints go maring.
[2:17:25] Oh, when the saints
[2:17:29] go maring.
[2:17:32] Oh, when the saints go marending.
[2:17:40] Oh Lord, I want to be in their number.
[2:17:47] Oh, when the saints go much. One more
[2:17:52] time, sing. When the saint
[2:17:56] went all the same

[2:18:09] Lord I want to be in that number
[2:18:17] when the saint go.

[2:18:24] When we gather
[2:18:27] around the throne
[2:18:32] and the gates
[2:18:34] are closed within.
[2:18:38] Oh, I'll be shouting

[2:19:08] Lord I want to be in that number
[2:19:16] when the saint
[2:19:19] one more time sing. Oh, when the s
[2:19:25] when all the saints

[2:20:11] in that number
[2:20:15] when the saints both are singing."
[2:20:24] Amen.
[2:20:26] We'll sing one more song as the brothers
[2:20:28] are collecting the tithes and offerings
[2:20:30] and then we'll get into our
[2:20:31] announcements. Amen.
[2:20:39] There is power, power, wonder working
[2:20:43] power in the blood
[2:20:47] of the lamb.

[2:21:20] wonderful power.

[2:22:17] pride. There is power,
[2:22:20] so much power.
[2:22:23] Oh come for a cleansing.
[2:22:29] There is wonderful power in the blood.
[2:22:33] There is power,
[2:22:39] wonder working power in the blood
[2:22:44] of the lamb.
[2:22:46] There is power, power, wonder working
[2:22:52] power in the preious blood of the lamb.
[2:22:59] Hallelujah.
[2:23:01] Somebody give the Lord a shout of
[2:23:03] praise.
[2:23:05] Amen.
[2:23:08] Glory. Amen. We can take our seats for a
[2:23:11] while. Um before we get into our
[2:23:14] announcements, our sister um sister
[2:23:17] Crystal have has a testimony. So if she
[2:23:20] can come up
[2:23:46] Hello everyone.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; I went to the
[2:24:06] So when I went in
[2:24:11] my examin
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; and then um so she came back was telling
[2:24:18] me that um my body um was trying to
[2:24:21] fight off like something but they didn't
[2:24:23] know what it was.
[2:24:31] So, um she told me to follow up my uh
[2:24:35] primary phys.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; So, I did that.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; So, I did that. So, I went in
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; um to my uh doctor and um so he gave me
[2:24:55] the results of my X-ray.
[2:25:00] X-ray.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Um, so he told me that I have that I
[2:25:04] have that I have five lymph nodes on my
[2:25:07] lungs.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Five lymph nodes on my lungs.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; And um, I have two lymph nodes on my
[2:25:24] thyroid.
[2:25:26] two lift nodes on my thyroid
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; or lift or Yeah, lift. Yeah, sorry. Um
[2:25:36] so, um they did do a bio they did do a
[2:25:39] biopsy um on the 14th of this month
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; on my lungs.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Yep. To um they had because three of my
[2:25:50] lymph nodes were swollen
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; on my lungs.
[2:26:04] and then um so I have to I had to after
[2:26:08] that was done I had to wait for my
[2:26:09] results.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Um so I did get my results back
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; um because um they didn't know if it was
[2:26:21] Oops, sorry.
[2:26:23] Um, at first they didn't know if it was
[2:26:25] cancer.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Um, so they said,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; so this is hard to pronounce. Um,
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; they say, um, now I have sarcodiosis.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um,
[2:26:49] thank you. Um it's a disease in which
[2:26:53] inflammation
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; um that produces tiny lumps
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; of the cells and organs
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; throughout the body.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Uh the lumps called granulomaus.
[2:27:24] most often appear in the lungs,
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; but they also can occur in the lymph
[2:27:31] nodes,
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; eyes
[2:27:42] in the eyes,
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; skin
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; or other areas of the body.
[2:27:50] So, um um I was prayed for
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; and um so I did talk to my brother uh
[2:27:57] Gabriel
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; um just because he's been a nurse for
[2:28:02] years.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; So, um he did tell me he's like, "Well,
[2:28:09] what I need to do
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; is to change my whole diet.
[2:28:18] Um because I did tell him
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; that they were wanting to put me on
[2:28:22] predazone for three months.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Predazone
[2:28:30] um and have me to do therapy
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; and I would have to go to Iowa City. I
[2:28:36] don't know how often for that.
[2:28:41] Um but I have decided
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; um to kind of take matters in my own
[2:28:47] hands
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; to take matters in my own hands.
[2:28:55] um to just um not eat any processed food
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; and just cut out all the the sugar and
[2:29:10] coffees pops and all that stuff.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; So, um but I just want to I'm just
[2:29:17] standing up here. I just want to thank
[2:29:18] God to, you know, let him know that I
[2:29:21] appreciate him for me not having cancer.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; Um, I was really scared.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:29:39] Amen.
[2:29:41] So, Jehovah Rafa, he can heal.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um so we want to make an
[2:29:47] announcement regarding the building
[2:29:49] contributions.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; So it's just a brief financial report
[2:29:57] for um everything that happened in 2025.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Um I'm starting I'll start out with
[2:30:13] All right. Yeah. Um, so we started
[2:30:16] collecting our building contributions in
[2:30:18] 2024
[2:30:21] towards the end of that year.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; And 2024 we collected a total of
[2:30:26] $10,100.
[2:30:31] That was in in three three months.
[2:30:38] That's how much we're able to collect in
[2:30:40] 2024 by the end of the year.
[2:30:44] Then the whole of 2025
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; we collected a total of 6,750
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; which was um very little compared to
[2:30:58] what we were expecting to to be
[2:31:01] collecting
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; because based on our projections we're
[2:31:08] supposed to collect about $5,000 every
[2:31:10] month.
[2:31:16] So every month for the six months, we
[2:31:19] were estimating to collect $30,000.
[2:31:32] $10050.
[2:31:35] So we are very very much way below our
[2:31:38] expectations and our projections.
[2:31:45] Then this year 2026 to date
[2:31:51] we've collected $300 $350
[2:31:56] which is just this month of January
[2:31:58] because remember January is a building
[2:32:00] contribution collection month.
[2:32:08] Yeah. So we are very much below our uh
[2:32:10] we are very much below our expectation.
[2:32:16] But like we agreed we'll just keep on
[2:32:18] collecting. However much we go
[2:32:24] that snail pace just as much as we
[2:32:26] contribute that's how much we going to
[2:32:28] proceed with.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; So to date starting from since October
[2:32:38] 2024 we have collected $17,200.
[2:32:49] So that's how much we have um in our
[2:32:52] church building contribution funds.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; So just to reiterate, we asked uh we all
[2:33:02] agreed that each and every working
[2:33:04] person is supposed to be able to pay at
[2:33:06] least $100.
[2:33:13] or more if the Lord put it puts it on
[2:33:15] your heart.
[2:33:19] But again, if you can make it, you can
[2:33:21] only contribute however much you can you
[2:33:22] can.
[2:33:26] So with that said,
[2:33:29] we're going to keep on collecting that
[2:33:30] contribution
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; until we get to a point in time where we
[2:33:35] can do something with the accumulated
[2:33:38] funds.
[2:33:47] My my apology uh we we we had thought to
[2:33:52] move the church
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; to try to connect with Iowa City's
[2:33:57] church as well,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; but that's off the table right now.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; The reason being is because it would we
[2:34:04] would leave too many people behind.
[2:34:07] will leave people here.
[2:34:11] Uh so we spoke with Iowa City.
[2:34:17] We're going to remain here,
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; but while we are here, we're still
[2:34:22] looking.
[2:34:24] I've got a realtor who's actually
[2:34:26] helping me.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Almost found a building. It was a
[2:34:32] hundred,000
[2:34:34] building which would have been perfect
[2:34:36] for us.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; But what happened is somebody beat me to
[2:34:42] it.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; So if you guys want to do something, you
[2:34:46] want to move forward.
[2:34:50] It's going to take your help.
[2:34:53] And even if you don't have money to
[2:34:55] give,
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; pray that God will put on somebody
[2:34:59] else's heart and bless somebody else. It
[2:35:01] doesn't have to, you know, some of y'all
[2:35:03] are just prayers. If you can pray,
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; God will do it,
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; you know, but we should be further up
[2:35:10] the road
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; than we are.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And this is about you and about the
[2:35:16] people of God because I believe
[2:35:20] if we get a bigger building and a and a
[2:35:22] place that seem a little more safer,
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; God will bless
[2:35:30] because in the winter time it is quite
[2:35:32] dangerous
[2:35:35] to be out there
[2:35:37] sometimes in the dark.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Um, but we want to do better
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; and we want a bigger place,
[2:35:46] but it all depends on what you all want.
[2:35:50] And so I really appreciate our brother
[2:35:52] Sam and all the efforts that he's doing
[2:35:54] to get us to to give.
[2:35:58] But like I said,
[2:36:00] It's whatever you guys want.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; You know, everybody was talking about
[2:36:04] buying property
[2:36:07] and building a building on this and
[2:36:09] that,
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; but you know, that takes money
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; and we'll have to do better than that.
[2:36:18] There's not something that we can't do.
[2:36:21] It all depends on whether you want to do
[2:36:23] it
[2:36:26] because we do have it. We can do it.
[2:36:28] Everything causes for a sacrifice.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; The greater the sacrifice, the greater
[2:36:33] the blessing.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:39] So we haven't given up on the plans to
[2:36:42] move out of here.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; And remember this is for all of us.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; So the burden is not just on the pastor
[2:36:53] or on the church leadership.
[2:36:58] Just to uh say this again what we say
[2:37:01] before. If you come across a property or
[2:37:03] a place that you believe is suitable,
[2:37:09] please uh come up forward and give us
[2:37:12] that idea so we can assess it.
[2:37:16] Amen. Because we want to leave out of
[2:37:18] here. Usually when it rains, we usually
[2:37:20] get water falling in here.
[2:37:24] Amen. With that said, we just want to
[2:37:27] appreciate and thank each and everyone
[2:37:28] who was able to contribute.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Let's just clap hands for ourselves.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray that the Lord may add
[2:37:36] blessings and reward you for the giving
[2:37:38] that you gave.
[2:37:42] Then next um it's just a
[2:37:46] what everything that happened in 2025
[2:37:48] regarding offerings.
[2:37:56] The total offerings that we collected in
[2:37:58] the year of 2025
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; was $25,28864.
[2:38:12] That's how much we collected in offering
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; and our rent
[2:38:18] every month without the utilities and
[2:38:22] other stuff.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; Our rent was um monthly rent is
[2:38:29] $1,66420.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; So the whole of 2025 our rent was
[2:38:37] 19,970.
[2:38:42] And the surplus of the offering from the
[2:38:44] rent is $5,300
[2:38:47] $31824.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; And with this, that's where uh the bills
[2:38:55] and utilities come from.
[2:39:00] um helping out with the Sunday school
[2:39:02] things that happen
[2:39:06] for your kids and all the everything
[2:39:09] that needs to be funding from church is
[2:39:10] supposed to be from that difference
[2:39:15] and also when we have visiting ministers
[2:39:17] come in
[2:39:19] it is the offering that's supposed it is
[2:39:22] the offering that's supposed to pay for
[2:39:23] their accommodation
[2:39:28] traveling and whatever is needed. in
[2:39:30] there.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; So just to summarize
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; that that diff that amount was not
[2:39:38] enough to cover all that.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; So basically our collection and how much
[2:39:45] we we spent was in the red.
[2:39:54] Um I mentioned this before, but I'd like
[2:39:56] to reiterate it again.
[2:40:01] So every difference that's not that the
[2:40:05] church couldn't cover
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; is the pastor who did.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; So every expense that we're not able to
[2:40:13] meet
[2:40:18] the pastor uses his own money.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; But it is not supposed to be like that.
[2:40:24] We are supposed to be self sustaining.
[2:40:30] And we are supposed to be in surplus.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; So just look at those figures and keep
[2:40:37] that in your mind.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; We are operating in the red deficit and
[2:40:45] that's not a good thing.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; But that's the totals for 2025
[2:40:52] of
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; how much we were able to collect and
[2:40:54] some of the money that we spent.
[2:40:59] so as we're getting into 2026.
[2:41:03] I pray the Lord will put it on our heart
[2:41:07] so we can financially do better.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; And when someone says put your money
[2:41:12] where your mouth is.
[2:41:15] So if you say we want to move out of
[2:41:17] this building as soon as possible,
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; may your giving reflect what you were
[2:41:25] saying.
[2:41:28] Amen.
[2:41:30] Let's clap our hands ourselves for the
[2:41:32] offerings and all the giving we have
[2:41:33] done.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's it for the building
[2:41:38] contribution
[2:41:40] and the offerings. And um just a
[2:41:43] reminder, we have the pastor's birthday
[2:41:46] celebration.
[2:41:51] going to be next week on Sunday,
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; February the the 1st.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; And um we're going to put the address in
[2:42:02] the church group
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; so that people can so you can get it.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Um I believe it's a place where we had
[2:42:12] other two weddings, right?
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; It's the event center where we had the
[2:42:18] wedding for sister Cecil and Sister
[2:42:20] Naomi.
[2:42:24] So, that's the place where we'll be at.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; And uh the time we are supposed to be
[2:42:30] there, we supposed to be there from 2:00
[2:42:32] p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; And please note, we need to be out by 5
[2:42:43] because that's how long the building has
[2:42:44] been reserved for.
[2:42:49] So, please 2:00 p.m. clock time,
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; not 2 p.m. uh African time.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh the sooner we in, the
[2:43:01] sooner we out
[2:43:05] and
[2:43:07] it's February the 1st.
[2:43:11] I believe that's all the announcement I
[2:43:14] have for today.
[2:43:16] I don't think I forgot anything today.
[2:43:28] bones
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; right now. They said that the cancer has
[2:43:31] moved from his prostrate into his bones.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; So, you know, he's got a lovely wife,
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; and he he has two more children than I
[2:43:45] have. He has they have 10.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; So, they need him.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; And um he's been closer to me than my
[2:43:56] natural brother or sisters.
[2:44:01] We desire your prayers.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; Even though, you know, he's heavy on my
[2:44:06] heart, I I said unto the Lord, I'm not
[2:44:09] interested in, you know, you prolonging
[2:44:12] his life.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; He just turned 73 months ago.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; I just want to make sure he's ready,
[2:44:24] you know, as a believer.
[2:44:27] I believe God's going to raise him up.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; He told me today that all of his vitals
[2:44:33] came back looking good.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; But it is a strain. They have a a
[2:44:40] restaurant
[2:44:42] and he played a great part in keeping it
[2:44:44] going.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; If you don't remember his name, just say
[2:44:51] brother Brooks Fred.
[2:44:53] We appreciate you. Thank you.
[2:44:57] Amen. We have come to the end of our
[2:45:00] service. Are we still happy to be in the
[2:45:02] house of the Lord this Sunday afternoon?
[2:45:04] Just shake around in your neighbor's
[2:45:06] hand and say, "Are you still happy?"
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; I see some silent faces.
[2:45:17] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[2:45:23] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[2:45:29] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[2:45:35] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[2:45:40] Lord,
[2:45:41] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[2:45:47] with the heart of thanksgiving,
[2:45:54] I will bless thee, oh Lord,
[2:45:58] with my hands, with my hands lifted up,
[2:46:06] and with my mouth filled with the
[2:46:12] With the heart of thanksgiving,
[2:46:18] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[2:46:22] So I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[2:46:28] Oh,
[2:46:30] I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[2:46:36] With the heart of thanksgiving,
[2:46:42] I will bless thee, oh Lord. So I will
[2:46:47] bless.
[2:46:52] Oh,
[2:46:54] I will bless thee.
[2:47:29] Well,
[2:47:37] down.
