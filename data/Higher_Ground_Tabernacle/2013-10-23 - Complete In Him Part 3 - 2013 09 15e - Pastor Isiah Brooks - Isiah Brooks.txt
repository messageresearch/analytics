TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen we're going to ask that you uh turn with us to two passages of scripture we're going to be coming from first John amen the third chapter beginning at the ninth verse amen and from there we'll go to St John 6 and 37 for this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning oh no um ninth verse whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God now we never would have known that without a messenger he said we cannot disbelieve in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother but this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another now look at look where he takes us not as Cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous and amen amen St John 6:37 you know I Marvel you know I uh I was back there you know just on the verge of just sharing shedding tears uh because I realize how important these messages that uh God has allowed me to minister is uh um how important they are and I realize that uh it it's still uh seem to be going over the people's head but you know what you can't be nothing that you ain't and uh uh you know I know some who are not here because of legit reasons but there are those amen who are not here because they just absolutely tired amen listen St John 6:37 for all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out amen you like that one amen let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord and we pray father that you would just move and just continue to break and destroy the yolks of the enemy unveil the devil lord that's in our lives that we might see him clearly Lord God bless us right now and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen de love God you may be seated still on completion I don't know which part it is brother third or fourth but I trust by the grace of God um you know I want to send this uh uh message um to um brother Barnes and by the grace of God I know brother um Troy's probably overwhelmed he's supposed to be showing me how to download all that stuff so as soon as we get it done we can get her done amen but you know I I look at this and I'm surprised because you know I've had people calling me from all different places of the United States and you know they missed the sermon cloud and want to hear and I didn't even know people were listening even my pastor my old Pastor from South Carolina Brother Anderson said the people have just been wanting to hear you brother Brooks and they um I I I he said I I'm calling to see whether we can find a way of listening amen so um people of God I don't know what all God is doing but I do know one thing you know like the word of God said a prophet is without honor in his own country it seem to people that people everywhere seem to enjoy the messages more so than what we do at home not that's not for everybody here but you know what I'm saying for as a whole I think people out there can hear it and understand it better than some of us in this place but that's the way it was at Bram Tabernacle it it is what it is but I want you to understand by the grace of God this is not brother Brook sitting down trying to contemplate on what he's going to minister I believe with all my heart that the sermons or the messages have been Vindicated by Brothers amen that this is what God would have for us in this last day now uh we we still dealing with completion but one of the things I heard that the prophet of God said this morning he said you know this using that scripture he was praying he says father I thank you because you said If any man cometh into me I will no wise cast him out so we realize by the grace of God that you hooked and understand amen this is an unconditional Covenant so get your mind off of your failures and look at his victories and I believe by looking at his victories you'll become Victorious amen so when we look at these things you and I must understand amen as I said it is all about the seed that's why I I read the scripture if if the seed be in you because the word of God said this is what determines whether you be of God or whether you be of the devil it's absolutely the seed in you right and in that message in uh uh why people tossed about excuse me I even listen and he he goes on and says oh whenever you say I you know I've got to do better I've got to quit this I've got to quit that he said you're still in the outer Court he said you're not in the holies of holies yet because in the holies of holies God takes it all away from you and you become dead to yourself now he didn't say it wasn't a good place to be he was just basically trying to tell us is not the end result it's not where our destiny our destiny is to be placed the Shina of glory amen between the cherubim or the wings of the cherubims to live an eternal life as I said on Wednesday we have been smitten out of or heed out of the seven Church age and we are now in what we call the Eternal age some people say the eighth age but brother Brandon called it the Eternal age meaning that you pass from death into life and you can't die no more amen ain't God good to us amen so we realize by the grace of God we showed you this morning how that we have our battles but there was a one thing I wanted to bring out where where I read in Romans 7:24 Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death in other words the power of death and here in question and answers I I want you to listen closely here the prophet of God says now as long as the six senses agree with the faith wonderful but when the six senses disagree with Faith then leave the six senses alone amen now for instance here Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reason that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man now that's the same thing that Paul's speaking of he was sold under the law to conal sin and every one of us is the same that's the reason we have trouble with do of marrying four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish amen amen hello but then inside we are a spiritual man Soul inside and that faith in God's word then we bring out excuse me then we bring our ourside our excuse me we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God Said how can I take a cabur and make a grain of wheat out of it is impossible for me to do it hello Amen in other words if you're not born again it's impossible to live holy am the only way it can be is because inside the cabur has been transmitted it from a cck wheat a cabur to a germ called wheat life you understand that then you Barry that cockabur and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in the cockabur and all of us were cockaburs right and the life of the cockabur has been taken out but the nature of the cockabur is sticky and that's your flesh right see and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again amen when it comes forth then it's no matter no more cabur but wheat but while it's here on Earth uh out of the Earth the cabar is still sticky but it's got the nature of the inside of it of wheat that's why you have problems your outside nature which is your flesh is a cuar but your inside nature amen is wheat so the cabar and the wheat fight all the time it Wars against the Bible said the spirit Wars against the flesh amen and as long he is basically telling us until we get rid of the outside which comes by way of a complete Rapture you going to always have a stickiness to you yes sir Hallelujah come on somebody and as long as you are in this life you're going to be sticky and have a caral nature that's going to bother you as long as you live amen but the inside of you wo you're born again Hallelujah and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you so what are you saying brother I'm saying there's a Perfection amen that is happening on the inside of an imperfect body yes sir that's why God has to change your body and as long as you are in this Natural Body you're going to have troubles don't even think you're not amen but God ain't concerned about your natural body he got that all under control he's looking at the Spirit man that's on the inside of you when the devil say you can't make it you tell him he's a liar I've already made it now we're coming here by the grace of God listen cuz first Peter says 4 and one for as much as then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that have suffered In the Flesh have ceased from sin hello meaning by the grace of God you going to suffer you're going to be affected by your flesh but you won't give into it hello amen and when you can come to the place where you have no longer amen uh allowing yourself to give into your flesh amen you have ceased from unbelief amen because that's the reason brother B said every sin that we may commit is all because of unbelief now we came and we showed you faith is the foundation and you must be born again amen right that is the faith seed Lord Jesus Come into my heart I accept you and the word of God said at that moment you have passed from Death unto life that's almost like that little germ amen uh coming into the seed of the woman it's potentially a baby but it ain't a baby yet it's got nine months to be formed shaped amen and it ain't all done yet at the end of that nine months it still got to have a messy birth that's right it ain't over yet that baby still got to cry out for life right when that baby takes its own breath it is an individual and to prove that it is they snip the card Hallelujah that individual don't and you know brother brandom and why are we so tossed about he said all of us are children he said all of us are baby and don't you ever think you grown in God all of us he said we nothing but little children think about it when you think you have come to a place am man you think you know it all oh God God to flipped that switch on you Hallelujah knowledge Amen to judge whether it is right or wrong the word is right I'm wrong God have mercy on us is that all right the word is right and every man be a lie the Bible don't contradict itself that's right remember amen if you don't understand it keep your mouth shut to God give you understanding amen because the word of God is true and let every man be a lie even when it comes to the prophet of God if you don't understand what he's saying keep your mouth shut amen amen because you know I believe and that the more I see this thing the more I believe I says Lord God have mercy I don't need nobody's interpretation cuz God done gave me his amen Temperance means only uh right right when the Holy Spirit Temperance how to control your tongue not be a Tattler and fly off when somebody offends you w Hallelujah you know James said if you can't even do that he said your religion is in vain amen come on somebody amen but this is what God is here for as I said the abundance of this entrance has been ministered to us Paul talked about it and think about it when Paul said it amen in in First Peter uh the 2 chapter uh uh uh uh second Peter the 1 chapter amen he said in the 11th verse an entrance will be made you know what he was so seeing he must have been must have been seeing the last Angel messenger coming down to the rde of Jesus Christ Hallelujah telling her exactly what to do how to get from being hadessa into being Esther amen and all esta had to do you know I was thinking about it when you into those royal families and that Ela didn't have to scrub herself clean she had all she had to do she had maidens there I don't know strange but she did she had maidens there that literally washed her the king didn't have to wash himself they had there were those who washed him and that's what we do all you got to do is let fall on the cross and let God wash you let God wash you a lot of time we spend too much time trying to wash ourselves but God can only wash us that's why he puts a place your arm can't reach all the way back there are some places on your body you can't reach now you might have a brush but in your natural being God put it there so you know you can't clean your whole body it takes God to clean you amen it takes God to clean you oh praise God ain't that good now I went to Godliness and us to be just like God Matthew 5:48 amen says be ye therefore perfect even as your father's in heaven is perfect right Ephesians 4:12 we said the five-fold ministry was given to do what to perfect the Saints amen so it is the will of God for us to be perfect amen but how is it going to take place listen look at all the people where are they it take a five-fold Ministry to perfect you that's why you know I get so I I used to get discouraged I going to say get discouraged but I used to get so discouraged because you know let me say it like this is this okay amen you know nobody in here gives I put it this way I won't say nobody but when it comes Amen to uh flying people in giving them an offering who who where do you think that come from and it it it it and yet you you could pay all of this money for people to come and be a blessing to the people and they have missed church and they don't know the pastor is inspired to get these people in CU they got a word to help perfect them amen it's not my doing it's the Lord's doing amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen and you listen I'm going tell you something I could hold on to that that money yeah y'all understand me but I can't because God won't let me my point is there's always a sacrifice and yet the people are Miss service knowing you got a a speaker coming like tonight like today oh I've been sitting there hearing a message like I heard we heard this morning Ain't No Way Out of Miss This unless it was necessary I'm not talking about those who's sick our sister who's not feeling I'm not talking about that I'm talking about those who bodily able to come amen I so I I admire my sister Vala she's really pressing battles I believe with all my heart she going to come through don't you worry I believe with all my heart she going to come through listen and listen if God should decide to do something different it ain't long we don't have long here oh my God it won't be long one thing I can truly say we know where she going y'all I know I know I know brother I'm my mother went want me too but you know don't you worry about that God got it all under control God got it all under control brother amen listen we understand godliness just being like God right being like God being with God acting like God would be right amen so you must and I how are we going to get there first of all you must be born again you cannot be adding these things without being born again right don't try to add it till you actually born again that's what he said in statute of a perfect man don't try to add it till you actually born again cause it won't work you can't make it work it'll come to this or or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here to the genuine born again duve you don't add nothing it adds to you huh comes up on come on up all right coming to the perfect all right the 60 uh uh let's add the Bible said here adding brotherly kindness and all up now you see what brother Brook listen let me say it like this and this is one of those uh quotes uh brother Shar with me which is so true it's so un listen when you when you when you uh sometime this week listen to the unconditional Covenant Abraham unconditional Covenant and you'll find out brother Bram talks about how Jesus Christ swore by his death he'll do it for you cuz nobody can do it nobody everybody had a covenant and the Covenant they were breaking them left and right but you can't do it I can't do it no man can add to the cuic the statue of but God purposely put a seed in you and he knew the seed had the ability to do it listen now you think about it God protected Abraham even while he was lying right yeah he never switched the the Covenant because Abraham lied he never changed the cuz Sarah laughed and what did God do when Abraham laughed he couldn't cuz God done already promised Abraham it was unconditional he bind himself to his own word so is it with the bride of Jesus Christ if you bride I don't care what condition you are in now before it all ends up you'll be right with God Abraham lied and you know he was fearful and God said none of the fearful going to go there and he was fearful you tell him that that you're my sister right not moai just tell him half of the story right and God still told our King if you don't go restore his wife and pray Abraham to forgive you he said I'm GNA wipe you out the king said well Lord you know I'm a righteous and man I'm an inte man of integrity God said I know you are that's why I came to woman you amen but he still you know it would have made me feel good and bad at the same time I'm I'm not guilty Lord I'm not wrong but Abraham is but yet I made a condition I made an unconditional Covenant with him and as far as I'm concerned Abraham is holy and righteous Hallelujah that's God that's it amen don't y'all better be glad cuz I'm going tell you something if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ your thoughts would condemn you every day hello you might not you don't have to think on the devil all day all you need is one thought you've entertained too long finish thank God for the grace of God every time I think about the crown of thorns on his head I think about all those thoughts that he was crucified for all those crws pressed into his head cuz that's what the devil does he presses his thoughts into your head but even for your thoughts he died for you Hallelujah glory to his name amen brotherly kindness put yourself in the place of the matter and it's so quick to do right for us to judge Brothers I've been guilty I've done it many times Lord forgive us of our sins he said adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter my brother sin against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times times a day he says 70 times seven see brotherly kindness now you see if a Brother All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no see be kind to him go anyhow somebody said not long ago said how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and the Oneness and all of the rest of them well see brotherly kindness hoping someday patience with him temperance enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes and remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith someday God will bring him in brotherly kindness the seventh thing that ought to sound good to somebody brotherly kindness s I'm going tell yall something you don't know what brotherly kindness is until you test it patience longsuffering and you say to you you know what but they know better they've heard let me tell you something you have never heard until you hear from your heart you might have it here but it means nothing until it comes down into the heart and a person cannot react on the truth until it comes down in the heart amen he could pretend but the reality of truth comes from the heart is that all right charity which is love that is the capping Stone he said one of these days in the church he said let it be known on the tape whereever more I'm not teaching this as a Doctrine what I'm going to say now but I'm just wanted to show you that by the help of God what it is what it really is that the first Bible that God ever wrote was in the Zodiac in the skies it started off with Virgin it ends up with the old lion and when I get into the sixth and seventh seal you'll find out when that other seal was opened the Zodiac Mark the that place was cancer the cross fish that's the cancer age amen we're living in now revealed and the next thing the seal tore off it revealed Leo the Lion the second coming of Christ he comes in the first through the Virgin he comes next Leo the Lion I'm bringing his thought see now let me understand so you can understand that's why cancer was ever able to to to be magnified on the earth at the same time the seals were open because that was the age we were living in and the prophet word God gave the prophet said if you can get them to believe that even cancer will not stand before you see because that was the age but that age was moving into the Leo the Lion the coming of the Lord amen and that's where where we are amen come on somebody so if God whipped it last year or year before year amen he's able to whip it now amen listen he goes on say remember it's in his heart and that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday will bring him in brotherly kindness seven thing listen now I jump back it ends up with the Leo the Lion and when I get into the six and seven seal it goes on and says amen that's the councel agent we're living in now revealed and the next thing the seal to off it revealed Leo the Lion the second coming of Christ he comes the first through the Virgin he comes next to Leo the Lion I'll bring this through I don't know I don't I've done whether I don't whether I'm going to have time this morning going to do the best I can show you that these steps are in the pyramid just ex exactly the second Bible God wrote Enoch wrote them and put them in the py and the third God always perfect in the third then he made himself his word see now listen he said God perfects it now we was looking at this as being really the third but you're the third he perfected his word in Jesus Christ right in the body of a man right so you and I we look at this and you say here our nation saying the things they are and making fun of these things and their money and their currency testifying that the Seal of the whole universe is God see that I standing up there above that on the dollar bill and that's the Great Seal it never was put on top of the pyramid they couldn't understand why the capping Stone was rejected they head Christ and that's what they did America testified their home dollar bill testified that they were going to reject the capping Stone they didn't seal it they put it there but they didn't seal it amen so their own dollar bill rejected uh was a a a testimony that the World At Large would actually reject the capping Stone he said but it will come someday now in the building virtue building this moment building this statue it starts off in the foundation that's on faith virtue knowledge Temperance patient ging his brotherly kindness he said then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things yes sir right in here right in here he said I've got in between all these Works in here and here there's little waves coming what is it the holy ghost coming down through Christ Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding This Together building a what a perfect church for the calf Stone to cap it all amen what what is be it being done again it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven Church Messengers oh my where was the church and I hope y'all don't me mind me reading where was the church the first founded where was the Pentecostal Church first founded by St Paul at Ephesus the star of the Ephesian Church age Ephesus the second Church age was Smyrna virtue Iranians the great man who helped uh gospel of Paul next Church age was pergamus amen was Martin was great man who stayed uh Paul Iranian Martin then in thar come Columba remember here it is draw out here right here Columbus After columus the Dark Ages come in here the second Sardis which mean death Luther hallelujah what then what comes next after sardus Luther then comes Philadelphia Garlin Wesley Holiness just uh the just shall live by faith and Luther Sanctified amen through Wesley then come in brotherly kindness through the lay of the sea and we believe the great message of the second appearing of Elijah in the last days shall sweep the land and here you are seven Church ages seven steps God building his church like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of God coming down through this welding this together now you can't weld Without fire amen huh you got to have fire for these virtues to be be welded in amen he builds the church and he is now building individuals the same way every Church age become one big church is that right oh my I'm GNA read this quote I read again this morning because this is what the page I jumped to amen he says what Jeffersonville need he said thousands of Little Voices the Thundering of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lies walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's thundering again uh against the enemy Hallelujah the devil don't care how loud you holler jump or shout but what he hurts the devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God and then he goes on to say that's the Thunder that shakes the devil hallelujah it's your lives it's our lives is that all right right Christ he goes on and you talk he want to walk through you he want to talk through you he want to think through you he want to speak through you he want to see through your eyes he want to use your lips right oh help us Lord Jesus Jesus yes and that came from why people are so tossed about let your sermon be live that's the best sermon ever preached Let It Be Live let me read this is okay amen he says then Peter here says first thing Faith virtue see coming up knowledge Temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the Living God Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these vers churches here Co into you you still off the real true foundation of Faith think about that but when these virtues grow in as you added that to that then you are living monuments you are living moving Idol but you know the heathens they prostrate themselves before an idol imaginary God and in an imaginary way they believe that the imaginary God speaks back to them that's heathenism that's romanism they bow before all kinds of saints and everything else they have saints Cecilia houseu and so many different things like that they bow to that and actually believe that in an imaginary way and we don't have to imagine nothing he says what what a type it is to the true Living God but when we not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming by the Living God makes a living man a Living Image the statue of God what he's doing the same thing that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not an imaginary thing there's a reality that proves it I love that there's a reality that proves it see what I mean see how these virtues these building materials type in with the church Messengers with the church ages now how one of these days we're going to take each one of these words and study them out and show that it proves this right it goes together sure oh my how wonderful that is to see what it does now why is it so important to us to see these things is because the world is trying to tell us we don't have to do it oh you got Grace and that's enough but Grace is go is the time that God allow tght you to get it right amen woo come on somebody bringing us to a place where the world is dead just give me a few more minutes you know because I'm not going I don't want to rush through none of this I want I want God to really really show us amen where he's taking us and people I want you to know amen there's no fear you don't have to fear when the shepherd himself is leading you amen right amen uh that's what David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want right so you don't have to fear amen when God is doing something for you is that right amen amen amen yeah even in church sometimes it's hard to keep our minds on the word amen but you know you have to fight to keep your mind on the word amen like I always said take he goes on he says take the saath out of a peach tree and if you can transfer it by transfusion into an apple tree the apple tree would bear peaches sure certainly would no matter what the branches look like it's got an apple tree sap in it and whatever tree it is take the life out of that apple tree take it out and give it a sap transfusion and drain from the peach tree over into to The Apple Tree what happens it won't bear no more peaches see no sir it won't if the peach tree life comes into the apple tree rather it won't bear no more apples it'll bear peaches because it's got the life of it in it so is God is saying to you this evening if you bear God let God drain that Old Devil out of you that old bad sap that old bad blood out of you oh my and let God transfuse his blood into you he said it will never bear that bad blood fruit no more it'll bear the fruit of God Amen right you take us that's nothing but a wild Gorge or a not head and there's nothing to us for we all dead in sin and trespasses we're all in these kind of conditions and then we ourselves can prostrate ourselves give ourselves up until God takes his trans Fusion to the name of Jesus Christ because there's not another name under heaven whereby we must be saved and transfer the Life of Christ into us then we have this kind of Faith the faith that Christ had amen oh lord it's almost too much for your heart to comprehend but I'm going tell you it's the truth and I might not know how it's done but I know it's done not it will be done it's done amen amen where brother in my life I may not have seen all of the glory of it but I'm coming to it brother and so will you if you believe it that way amen Abraham called those things that be not as though they were Hallelujah you got to realize it wasn't easy for Abraham oh 85 year old man however it was first of all when God called him I think he was 75 and a Sarah was 65 and then add 25 years to that or whatever it took amen you think about it old come on somebody I I'm not even that old so you got to realize by the grace of God that was no easy task that was tough that was tough amen but still he believed it anyhow I don't care how crumped your be God said so and I believe it and that's the way you got to believe it I don't care how your flesh kick up and it look like the devil try to make you think you a Devil's Child that don't mean a thing that's right don't mean a thing you got to believe what's in you see cuz the devil can't hear the gospel but you can hear the gospel amen you thirst for the gospel the devil don't thirst for righteousness and God said if you thirst for it you shall be faled right and Christ Faith was not I'm just going to read this quote I'm GNA let you go and Christ's Faith was not based on those Pharisees or Sadducees or in their pots kettles and pans and their washing it was based on the word of God so much until Christ was the word my I I meant to read that scripture where he said he suffered In the Flesh think about it for you that means everything he you he went through he suffered for you see we don't have to suffer as such but the Bible still say likewise arm yourself to suffer in the flesh he took all your penalties when I was studying and thinking about that I thought about how that veil was rent the Bible said the veil was his flesh his Veil his flesh was rent for you and I from the top to the bottom Hallelujah that Soldier went this way boomop had to right because that's the way God did it in the temple he started at the top and came down Hallelujah and listen the word of God tells us amen that blood and water came out of there and we know it was from a broken heart Hallelujah where did the Bride come from not just from a rear bone came from the heart of God call it the bosom if you like so here God comes along and showed you he suffered for for us that we might come back into him and that's why the Bible said our lives are here amen our lives are here in Christ Jesus amen that's exactly right oh people of God how can we not blossom bloom and bring forth birds and armor and all that how can it not be God has already ordained it to be so the word was made flesh and then when we get we can get so uh transfused by his power that we'll die to our own thinking and our faith becomes a genuine Faith then the Life of Christ is transfused into us we become living creatures of God a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can send his radiant blessings down through there and we're in the Statue of Christ Jesus said it's not it is not is written you condemn me saying I the Son of God is it not written that ye are gods don't your law own law say that like Moses like Elijah like those prophets who live so close to God that God just transferred himself right unto them and they spoke not themselves but God take no thought what you should say cause it's not your you that speaks it's a father that dwells in you he do he's do he he doeth the speaking his words were not his own because his life he's dead if you die you take the blood out of a man you embomb him trouble of it is a lot of them never got in bom he said like uh he says listen like uh uh h I I've said take the sap out of the peach tree and if you can transfer it by a transfusion into an apple tree the apple tree would bear peaches sure certainly would no matter what the branches look like it's got an apple tree sap in it whatever ever tree it is see take the life out of the apple tree take it all out give it a sap transfusion drain from the peach tree over into the apple tree and what happens it won't bear no more peaches see it the peach tree life comes into the apple tree rather and it won't bear no more apples it'll bear peaches because it's got the life in it now I mean you can't get it no clearer than that listen this is not a hope so this is a must so it must be this way amen hallelujah how are we going to do it brother Brooks how it's going to get done all I know is that old dead tree didn't have to work for nothing all it had to do would be played behind the curtain and it was placed in there by what a Praying priest CU that priest could not get behind there without praying and that's where this incent before the veil was all about a sweet savior come on if it's sweet that means you ain't begging God come on somebody if it's sweet that means amen you ain't pleading amen you know what sweet things is oh God you sweet to me you holy you're righteous law amen your prayer is sweet hey and you're thanking God for what he's already done even though you can't see it that's right amen huh that's what God kind of prayer God likes amen if you going to get there and the back there with him you got to start preach saying some good stuff to God am come on somebody cuz you realize that ain't the dining room that ain't the kitchen that's the bedroom come on and I'm going tell you something it don't make no difference what I hate to say we grown enough but you can't go down go back get back there with honey do list you can't get back there with no honeydew list it ain't happening no sir you got to start speaking some good stuff you know like Esther did you know King I love eser but you love the Lord amen we're at a place right now you and I must understand it's a love affair and God expecting you to love on him as we said years ago uh not years ago uh some months ago and I'm going to close here on this because I don't want you to don't want to give too much but I want to say this and you've heard me say it and I'm GNA say it again the one thing I love about Esther is she understood where the denominational fa she understood amen with vast thy faith cuz the king called for the greatest Treasure of his kingdom to come before him into his banquet and she refused because she was in her own self-righteous selfish mode hanging with the sisters y'all hear what I'm saying and what happened was Esther knew where vast I fell so she knew the king never got what he wanted all he wanted was a personal banquet all he wanted was a personal and she she said oh I know what he likes he likes to be worshiped he likes to feel like a king come on Amen and she said I'm G to make him feel like a king cuz I'm going to invite him now I know he's got a good buddy he's called a devil you understand me I'mma bring hymon he thinks hymon is his friend but I'm going let him see how H ain't nothing but Old Devil Now understand our God knows who Lucifer is but understand Lucifer still works for God he still works for God Amen but now Lucifer trying to kill me and he can't kill me Hallelujah I'm Queen Hal yall understand so she comes and she said listen I'm going to worship you I'm going to serve you and I don't care if the devil come to prayer meeting with me I'm going still show him how much I love God Amen because the devil gonna come when you kneel he kneels too I don't don't know whether he kneels or not but I know he's de whispering in your ear he ain't kneeling to worship he's kneeling to discourage you you love the Lord so you get home wherever you go I don't care fine ask God God give me the time show me and I'm going tell you sometime most of the time it's going to have to be a sacrifice God the devil ain't going to just let you have all this extra time to do what you want to do with God somewhere you're going to have to schedule something with God and don't tell nobody until you get there cuz soon as you let it out everything going to come the phone going to rain the children going to get sick something going to happen to keep you from making that appointment with God and you got to get with God and says listen the devil don't know this Lord but in my heart I done told you what I'm getting ready to do and you know what you don't have to worry about Jesus ever missing in his appointment cuz brother brand said Jesus keeps all his appointment all of them so once you make it amen in your heart you and God don't say it with your lips don't even tell your brothers there are times I come down hereen I said listen I'm want I'm going go down and I'mma set shut in amen at the church and I'mma pray and fast I'm telling you talk about battling it would have been best if I kept my mouth shut and come down here and and and you know devil will get the news but he gets it late you know what I mean the channel is already open right so don't tell the devil all you got to do and what you getting ready to do with God Amen did did did Esther tell hymon never knew it never knew it you don't tell the devil either you just go on in the banquet and have fun with your king and then you know she he's he's already asking her now what else do you want after that first one she says listen I know you didn't get the first banquet so I'm GNA give you two I'mma give you two vast I wouldn't give you one but I'mma give you two come on now I it's in the scripture what God likes and all we got to do is fall in line and give him a banquet am right you and God not us and God you and God let's stand amen yeah we going we we come to perfection God is working it right he's bringing us amen into a place and let me tell you something don't you get discouraged but say Lord I don't see this that the other God don't put on for nobody you understand what I'm saying Jesus had the power to do whatever he wanted to do but at the same time he was not going to put on the show or be some kind of monkey act amen for the devil right he didn't care about what people thought amen like they like it said you know here's a man that at the pool of Bethesda if you be truly the Son of God why don't you just heal all of them no God sent me to just to pray for one right amen that's how it is and because God don't have us and that's where the devil get us sometime God will let you just sit for a while amen before he move you but I want you to know when he does he's getting the glory out of your life you know and um don't get discouraged because you think you don't see nothing I tell you what one night we went uh went to bed the next night our tree had blossoming blooms on it amen it looked like it was going to it was going to die CU we you know planted this year and the Heat and all that and something just moved me go over there I remember what Vanda did with her apple tree something moved me go over there lay hands on that tree and I said You shall live and not die and my tree amen that tree looking like looking like it's on his last leg but then it comes right up with a blue BL God put the blossoms on the top of the tree the show me the sap was still there amen yes sir it's getting ready to go down but God gave me some out of season blossoms to prove to me that the tree is living and not dead ain't God good if God can do that for a natural tree he can do it for a human tree amen ain't God good let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how Lord we thank you for this time and this opportunity Lord we you're just so good to us we pray father God that you would just bless each and every heart remember Lord our sister Vanda Lord continue to heal and deliver her and Lord our our brother Robert everyone that have needs here Lord I pray that you be you would Minister to us and give us what we stand in need of forgive us all of our sins and our shortcoming and father keep us behind that Veil Lord God let us not go in and out in and out in and out but let us stay behind that Veil Lord that we might not only Blossom and Bloom but we bring forth the fruits of M granted in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
