[39:27] amen amen
[39:29] thank God for his grace and his Mercy
[39:32] we're just going to get right into the
[39:34] word of the Lord
[39:36] glad to be in the house of God
[39:38] surely it is a a blessing
[39:42] to be one of them
[39:46] a uh enjoyed the song service by the
[39:49] grace of God
[39:50] amen because it's all about him
[39:53] and he sang a song I had sung in a long
[39:57] time he's alive and well
[39:59] living in me
[40:05] you love God
[40:08] we're gonna move right on by the grace
[40:10] of God we ask that you turn with us to
[40:12] Saint John 3 16. we should be able to
[40:15] quote that scripture by the grace of God
[40:24] and it reads
[40:26] for God so loved the world
[40:29] that he gave his only begotten son
[40:33] that whosoever believeth in him should
[40:36] not perish
[40:39] but have everlasting life
[40:43] one more scripture
[40:46] first John
[40:47] 4
[40:49] 17-21
[40:59] here is our love made perfect
[41:02] that we may have boldness in the day of
[41:05] judgment
[41:07] because as he is so are we in this world
[41:13] there is no fear in love
[41:17] but perfect love casts out fear because
[41:20] fear have torment
[41:22] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[41:25] love
[41:27] we love him
[41:29] because he first loved us
[41:33] if a man say I love God and hated his
[41:36] brother
[41:37] he is a liar
[41:39] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[41:42] he hath seen how can he love God whom he
[41:45] have not seen
[41:47] and this is the Commandment that we have
[41:49] from him
[41:51] that he who loveth God love loveth God
[41:55] loveth his brother also let us pray dear
[42:00] Jesus we thank you we thank you for your
[42:02] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[42:05] being so good to us Lord
[42:07] we pray that you forgive us Lord and
[42:09] cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord
[42:11] our we come in here o God in this church
[42:14] to be washed to be cleansed to be
[42:16] Sanctified and filled with your Holy
[42:19] Spirit to be enlightened o God on the
[42:22] next step that we should make o God
[42:24] toward your Perfection and I pray God
[42:27] that you give us Grace to open our
[42:30] hearts and our minds now
[42:33] to receive your word tonight Lord I give
[42:36] us a heart to hear and and to receive
[42:39] your word we ask these things in your
[42:41] name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may
[42:45] be seated
[42:46] uh I think the
[42:48] one of the last messages I preached was
[42:51] receiving the end of your faith I'm not
[42:53] sure if I preached it here or in in
[42:55] South Carolina but
[42:58] um we were dealing with love and grace
[43:00] and and how these two are our twin
[43:04] sisters uh you can't give Grace without
[43:07] love and you can't have Grace Without
[43:08] Love
[43:10] um we know without the grace of God
[43:12] we're we're lost
[43:14] because the Bible tells us that we are
[43:16] saved by his grace
[43:18] and there is no greater uh revelation of
[43:22] God than his grace and his love toward
[43:24] us
[43:26] um this thing that we're working with
[43:28] tonight
[43:30] something struck me by the grace of God
[43:32] and you know I serve the Lord I'm not
[43:36] perfect
[43:37] but I do serve him and I was telling a
[43:41] brother you know I don't want to serve
[43:44] God out of fear
[43:47] I want to serve him out of love
[43:51] because the Bible said if you love me
[43:53] you'll keep my Commandments
[43:56] not if you fear me
[43:58] I believe that fear the kind of fear
[44:02] that we have
[44:03] been accustomed to is the fear that
[44:07] comes by the Fall
[44:09] Adam and Eve never feared God as such
[44:14] the they loved God
[44:17] it was because of what they did they've
[44:20] experienced fear in so much that the god
[44:24] that they so loved they hid from him
[44:28] uh because they knew he said the day
[44:31] that you eat of this tree you should
[44:33] surely die
[44:35] and out of fear they they took upon
[44:37] themselves religion
[44:39] trying to cover their nakedness but they
[44:43] found out that religion
[44:45] can't cover your nakedness
[44:49] uh we found out that the thing that
[44:51] covers you is the blood
[44:54] the blood of a lamb the blood of an
[44:56] innocent one
[44:58] nothing that you are worthy of it's
[45:01] something that is gifted to you by God
[45:04] himself because he so loved you
[45:08] now the effects of true love is a
[45:11] service of love
[45:13] not I do these things because
[45:16] if I don't do them I'm going to hell
[45:19] or God is going to punish me if I don't
[45:22] do this that or the other
[45:25] uh it's like a man fearing to commit
[45:30] adultery because of the consequences
[45:32] that he may have to face
[45:35] but that's not love
[45:37] goes beyond that
[45:41] when you truly love someone it becomes a
[45:44] force field
[45:45] it becomes a wall of fire it becomes uh
[45:50] your defense
[45:52] even though you know you can do it and
[45:55] perhaps get away with it and be forgiven
[45:59] but love constrains you
[46:01] because of the person that you love you
[46:04] don't want to hurt or disappoint
[46:08] one thing about love or the service of
[46:11] love it's never ashamed of the one
[46:14] that he loves
[46:17] uh it can never be embarrassed by their
[46:21] presence or their person
[46:23] love is one when you love an individual
[46:26] you always enjoy the fellowship or their
[46:29] presence
[46:30] you may even have times of disagreement
[46:32] but it doesn't change the love or the
[46:36] way that you feel toward that person
[46:39] I'm saying a lot of things because I'm
[46:41] going to read something to you in just a
[46:43] moment
[46:44] believe that
[46:46] the one you love will always speak the
[46:49] truth you know that's how trust you know
[46:52] you trust the one you love and that's
[46:55] why the Bible said trust the Lord with
[46:58] all of your heart
[47:00] and lean not to your own understanding
[47:03] but acknowledge the Lord in all your
[47:05] ways and he shall direct your path that
[47:08] trust is uh it's how can I say it it is
[47:13] like um the magnet of love
[47:17] and
[47:19] trusting
[47:20] God
[47:23] is one of the things that you'll never
[47:25] come out as a failure
[47:28] because if you trust God
[47:31] will trust you
[47:34] amen one thing about true love or the
[47:37] love that we're talking about we're kind
[47:40] of mixing it in a way the agape and the
[47:42] filio because they have similar uh
[47:46] effects
[47:47] even though the uh
[47:50] filial love don't take you as far as
[47:53] Agape but it is a love that God gives us
[47:56] toward one another
[47:58] that will and you don't have to be a
[48:00] Christian to have this filial love it is
[48:03] a love that comes that we cannot explain
[48:05] but it's it's more real than the desk or
[48:08] the chair that you're sitting on
[48:10] uh this love that we're talking about
[48:13] will always make wrong right
[48:15] uh I heard something the other day
[48:20] um which which we really stuck in my
[48:22] mind about evil
[48:24] it's like when you hear something that's
[48:26] evil and you don't say anything
[48:29] uh I believe a man said to not say
[48:33] anything makes you as evil as the person
[48:36] who said it
[48:38] uh it's because you're giving consent to
[48:43] the thing that has been said
[48:45] but you know what it is when we make
[48:47] wrong right is when we make mistakes and
[48:50] because of our Frailty because we are
[48:52] human because of the Fall we let we make
[48:55] mistakes every day
[48:58] but the love of God and the love for God
[49:03] makes us or helps us to make things
[49:06] right
[49:07] you know sometimes and I heard brother
[49:10] random said like this when we pray
[49:14] we don't even recognize who we praying
[49:17] to
[49:18] isn't that something
[49:19] and and I said Lord I'm guilty
[49:23] it you know I know I'm praying to God
[49:26] but the the depths of that
[49:29] the fullness of that is
[49:33] is something that escapes me sometimes
[49:37] because when you realize a man that
[49:39] you're talking to God and the Bible said
[49:42] God is love
[49:45] and when you're talking to God and
[49:48] you're talking to love you don't have to
[49:50] ever worry or be concerned about him
[49:53] mistreating you or mishandling you
[49:56] he will handle you according to his law
[50:00] of love
[50:02] and his judgments are pure
[50:04] his judgments are right
[50:06] love which is like a glue
[50:09] you know I put that smile on
[50:13] you know because Jesus said he loved us
[50:16] so much but then you know what he said
[50:17] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[50:20] basically I'm glued to you
[50:22] I'm stuck
[50:24] and I will always be with you no matter
[50:27] where you go no matter what you do and
[50:30] what I'm working with folks is this
[50:33] until we move from that fear
[50:37] into the love of God
[50:42] we are not accomplishing anything
[50:47] it is amazing that the love of God or
[50:51] the fear of God or you know what God is
[50:53] trying to get us to see is so
[50:57] profound if I want to say it like that
[51:02] um it it it it it literally escapes our
[51:05] understanding
[51:07] but it's not unreachable
[51:12] we may not understand it all
[51:15] but we can enter into that love of God
[51:18] where that love would direct us every
[51:21] day of Our Lives now I know I'm talking
[51:24] because it's okay
[51:27] coming from the church ages just the
[51:29] exposition
[51:30] of of of the seven Church ages during
[51:34] the dietary age God began to tell them
[51:37] things about themselves
[51:39] and he says I know your love and service
[51:41] faith
[51:42] Ians
[51:44] you will note that there is law the
[51:47] their love is placed between works and
[51:50] service
[51:51] and that is the right place for it
[51:55] listen because without love our works
[51:59] are not accepted before God neither is
[52:03] our service
[52:04] now that's something
[52:06] if you do anything
[52:08] just because you got to do it or you
[52:11] feel like it's the right thing to do but
[52:13] it's not done out of love
[52:16] it's not even accepted
[52:18] Paul speaking to the Corinthians and
[52:21] said without love I am nothing
[52:23] and whatever I do without do is without
[52:27] profit unless it's done in love
[52:31] now you can see right there
[52:33] that these Believers weren't in the
[52:36] Nickelodeon class that did works as a
[52:39] means of Salvation or to be admired by
[52:42] men and I find out that even in this
[52:45] message we do that
[52:47] to be admired by men or you know to be
[52:52] accepted in that way
[52:54] you know but listen that's that's not it
[52:59] and when you seek the admiration of men
[53:04] you're not you didn't gain nothing
[53:07] your service is not accepted
[53:10] it's only when you and I can turn to God
[53:12] and say to God be all the glory
[53:16] you did there they did their works out
[53:19] of love out of the love listen
[53:22] so they weren't part of the the
[53:23] nickelatin you know the nicolaitan
[53:25] spirit is to rule over uh one another
[53:28] you know I'm the boss you know I'm the
[53:31] one that's in control you know no no no
[53:33] no that's the wrong Spirit the spirit of
[53:36] God will always work together
[53:39] see they did their works out of out of
[53:41] the love of God that was shared abroad
[53:44] in their hearts by the Holy Ghost so in
[53:48] order to do the work of God in love you
[53:51] have to have the Holy Ghost
[53:53] see that love in their hearts was God's
[53:57] love in
[53:59] love for his own let me say that again
[54:01] that love in their hearts was God's love
[54:06] for his own and Jesus said by this shall
[54:10] you all all men know that ye are my
[54:14] disciples that you have loved one for
[54:17] another
[54:18] the pagans saw the lives of the early
[54:21] Christians and said behold how they love
[54:24] each other I wish God we could see that
[54:26] today
[54:28] because amen the love that we have for
[54:30] each other is supposed to be seen by
[54:33] others
[54:36] right
[54:37] uh me and a brother was talking today
[54:40] and I thought it was so wonderful you
[54:42] know how I hate texting I really like
[54:46] the old time way
[54:49] I like to talk
[54:51] God likes The Voice
[54:53] right and you know what Malachi talks
[54:56] about though they that speak of me and
[54:58] talk of me and be written in a book he
[55:00] didn't say they that text of me
[55:04] I thought that was pretty good but my
[55:06] point is
[55:09] we have developed we have come into the
[55:11] system of texting to and so much so that
[55:14] we're losing the affections of love for
[55:17] one another
[55:19] it's something about the voice sometimes
[55:22] I call Brothers sometimes I call sisters
[55:25] and that's that's in God I say hello God
[55:28] bless you I'm calling because I just
[55:30] want to hear your voice
[55:32] isn't that amazing because when they're
[55:35] dead
[55:36] you can look at that text all you want
[55:38] but you won't be able to hear that voice
[55:41] but one thing about a voice
[55:43] you always remember it
[55:46] it's recorded
[55:48] in your senses and in a voice you can
[55:51] tell whether a person love you hate you
[55:54] or pretending
[55:56] right
[55:58] so God loves you
[56:00] but he loves to hear your voice
[56:04] cry aloud right I want to give you a
[56:07] warning now he goes on and says the
[56:09] pagans who saw that lives of the early
[56:11] Christians behold they loved each other
[56:13] right first John 4 7 I want to give a
[56:17] warning right here
[56:19] it was concerning the last days and
[56:23] listen closely
[56:24] it's it's concerning the last days that
[56:28] because of abund abounding iniquity the
[56:32] love of many will wax cold
[56:36] in the Legacy and age or last age
[56:39] self-love love love for material things
[56:42] will take the place of the true love of
[56:45] God
[56:46] we need to guard against the power of
[56:50] sin in these last days
[56:52] so many are getting so hard because they
[56:56] haven't realized the effect of this day
[56:58] this last day spirit
[57:01] it is time to draw night to God let him
[57:05] fill our lives with his love or we will
[57:08] feel the coldness of the last day church
[57:11] and reject the truth of God which alone
[57:14] is able to help us
[57:16] in those dark and Dreadful years the
[57:20] True Vine heals it love for God and love
[57:25] of the Brethren and God commended them
[57:28] for it
[57:29] that that that's the third tire change
[57:33] and thyatara is when when when the
[57:37] church ruled right ruling and so it was
[57:41] it was where the nicolaitan spirit had
[57:44] taken on a stronghold a strong uh grip
[57:47] on the church
[57:49] now I'm saying this to say people of God
[57:52] tonight
[57:54] you got to serve God because you love
[57:57] God
[57:59] but not because oh uh
[58:02] and understand as I read the scripture
[58:04] the scripture says we love him
[58:07] because he first loved us
[58:10] right because he's given us that love
[58:13] for him that is the only way we could
[58:15] love him and in loving us with his love
[58:19] he trusts us yeah you can't just love
[58:22] him with filial love it has to be agape
[58:25] love
[58:26] that Holy Ghost love that loves God no
[58:30] matter what
[58:33] right
[58:34] oh my goodness you know
[58:37] it's a mystery
[58:39] and if we could understand what God has
[58:41] already done for us and I'm a type of
[58:44] person I'm I'm really when it comes to
[58:46] judging myself I'm really hard on myself
[58:49] uh you have no idea what I go through
[58:51] throughout the day uh because of uh
[58:55] entertaining thoughts or or not
[58:57] rejecting thoughts as soon as I should
[58:59] or you know those kind of things my
[59:01] greatest battles is my mind is in my
[59:03] mind
[59:04] but the truth of the matter is
[59:07] there are no condemnation
[59:10] to those who walk after the spirit and
[59:14] not after the flesh as long as you
[59:17] resist the devil the Bible said he will
[59:19] flee from you
[59:20] right but the mystery of this whole
[59:23] thing is is that let's put it this way
[59:25] when brother random went behind the
[59:28] curtain of time and he saw those
[59:30] theophany bodies there and he basically
[59:33] was trying to tell us he saw us there
[59:35] I'll never forget there's a man that I
[59:38] pastored when I was in Lima Ohio his
[59:41] name was Ned McKinney and brother
[59:43] Branham doing the ministry of he said
[59:46] Ned I saw you there
[59:48] now I don't know about you but it
[59:50] probably made the devil mad
[59:52] right and that had a hard time uh before
[59:56] he died but nevertheless he was already
[1:00:00] there
[1:00:01] y'all understand me you said well what
[1:00:04] do you mean how well how could you
[1:00:05] believe that I'll tell you a story of my
[1:00:08] mother who had a I went into a coma or
[1:00:11] whatever it was that she went into but
[1:00:13] she said before I knew anything about
[1:00:15] the other region she says no there's
[1:00:18] another world junior
[1:00:20] and she says in that world people are
[1:00:23] killing each other whatever they are and
[1:00:25] whatever you are on this Earth he said
[1:00:28] that's what they're doing there
[1:00:30] right if you're a murderer here you'll
[1:00:33] be a murderer there if you're a liar
[1:00:35] fornicator whatever you're doing you're
[1:00:37] doing it there she said it was a
[1:00:40] horrifying thing because she said I saw
[1:00:42] a man chopping off another man's head
[1:00:44] and he wouldn't even die now
[1:00:49] she and it didn't stop there
[1:00:51] she said my pastor was there
[1:00:55] this man was still living
[1:00:57] had one of the biggest churches in
[1:01:00] Colombia
[1:01:01] an Apostolic Church of Jesus name church
[1:01:04] and this man just kept on going but but
[1:01:07] his end result
[1:01:10] his end result was
[1:01:12] embarrassing
[1:01:14] y'all understand me without me going in
[1:01:16] detail he fell in such a horrible way
[1:01:20] but my thing is this where did he reject
[1:01:22] the truth
[1:01:25] see you don't go to hell unless you
[1:01:27] reject truth
[1:01:28] if God began to expound and bring out
[1:01:31] Mysteries and show you things that's in
[1:01:34] the word
[1:01:35] and you say oh I don't believe that well
[1:01:38] you just sign your death certificate
[1:01:41] because you can't believe some of the
[1:01:43] word you've got to believe all the word
[1:01:46] now they just believe it but you gotta
[1:01:49] love it all I love the scripture where
[1:01:52] it says God so loved the world that he
[1:01:55] gave his only begotten his son that
[1:01:58] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:02:00] perish but have everlasting life those
[1:02:04] words will never come back void
[1:02:09] and I couldn't understand that for a
[1:02:11] long time
[1:02:12] but then the prophet of God said it's
[1:02:14] not your sin it's not your your your
[1:02:17] your killing or your lying you're
[1:02:19] stealing your adult to your fornication
[1:02:21] he said that's not sin he says sin is
[1:02:24] unbelief
[1:02:26] and we do those things because we do not
[1:02:29] believe
[1:02:35] what we don't believe we don't believe
[1:02:38] Who We Are
[1:02:40] and who he say we are
[1:02:42] you understand me because once you
[1:02:45] believe who you are and who he say you
[1:02:47] are your life will change
[1:02:51] First Corinthians 2 7-17 says but we
[1:02:54] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[1:02:57] even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:03:00] ordained
[1:03:02] unto our Glory which none of the prisons
[1:03:06] princes of the world knew for had they
[1:03:09] known it they would not have crucified
[1:03:11] the Lord of Glory
[1:03:14] excuse me but as it is written I have
[1:03:18] not seen nor ear heard neither have
[1:03:21] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:03:24] which God had prepared for them that
[1:03:27] love him
[1:03:29] but God
[1:03:31] hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:03:36] for the spirit searches all things yea
[1:03:39] the Deep things of God
[1:03:42] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:03:45] say the spirit of a man which is in him
[1:03:48] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:03:52] but the spirit of God
[1:03:54] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:03:56] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:03:59] that we might know the things that are
[1:04:02] freely given to us what of God freely
[1:04:06] given no price to pay no pensions no no
[1:04:11] no works you must do they it is freely
[1:04:15] given to us but somehow we think we've
[1:04:18] got to do something to Merit it no his
[1:04:22] love
[1:04:23] is freely given and there is nothing you
[1:04:26] and I could ever do to Merit his love
[1:04:30] nothing
[1:04:31] so what what the problem is we have a
[1:04:34] problem accepting his love
[1:04:38] because his love is beyond understanding
[1:04:41] first of all we set and we think how can
[1:04:45] God love me and and why would he love me
[1:04:51] now the truth of the matter is
[1:04:55] you can ask those questions
[1:04:57] till eternity roll
[1:05:00] I'll tell you the answer
[1:05:02] because he so loved you
[1:05:06] that's it
[1:05:07] you didn't do anything to Meredith
[1:05:10] you can't do anything to earn it no no
[1:05:13] no no God chose you he's sovereign
[1:05:17] in his election
[1:05:19] he did not make a mistake when he chose
[1:05:21] you
[1:05:22] and you don't what we don't see is that
[1:05:26] no matter what we go through we are part
[1:05:29] of this message
[1:05:31] think about it how many people in the
[1:05:34] world
[1:05:36] that knows what we know
[1:05:39] and how many people in the church world
[1:05:41] that's literally being drawn into the
[1:05:45] perfect statue of Christ
[1:05:48] by who by the master builder by the
[1:05:52] carpenter it's not him that willeth nor
[1:05:55] he that run it but God what who shows
[1:05:58] Mercy
[1:06:00] it is God's grace that's why we're saved
[1:06:03] because he chose us
[1:06:07] Hallelujah not because of your family
[1:06:09] background or your family name or or
[1:06:12] what your occupation because in reality
[1:06:15] none of that will matter in the next
[1:06:17] world
[1:06:18] because in this world he gives us all a
[1:06:21] name change
[1:06:25] the whole family of Heaven and Earth is
[1:06:27] named after him
[1:06:29] I had somebody on the on on a little
[1:06:32] thing the other day and and I'm gonna
[1:06:35] put it in my turn he says my name is
[1:06:38] Isaiah Brooks Jesus
[1:06:41] I kind of like that but uh
[1:06:45] what was he doing
[1:06:46] identifying his himself with the name of
[1:06:50] Jesus Christ
[1:06:52] Hallelujah now the Bible said we have
[1:06:56] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:06:58] the spirit witches of God that we might
[1:07:01] know the things that are freely given to
[1:07:04] us which things also we speak not in
[1:07:08] Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[1:07:11] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[1:07:13] spiritual things with spiritual things
[1:07:16] I'll tell you one thing Brother Rich
[1:07:18] said to me today he said you know what
[1:07:20] he said you can have all the doctor's
[1:07:22] degrees of in Theology and and I hope
[1:07:25] I'm not may not be quoting him correctly
[1:07:27] but he said what different does it make
[1:07:29] when you've studied the whole Bible
[1:07:33] it doesn't even guarantee you that you
[1:07:35] truly understand it
[1:07:38] have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:40] it would lead you and guide you into all
[1:07:44] truth I thought that is amazing amazing
[1:07:48] but it's so
[1:07:52] many years studying the Bible
[1:07:55] and coming up with nothing new
[1:07:58] is chewing gum chewed over again
[1:08:01] right but when you are in Christ as
[1:08:05] Christ
[1:08:06] Spirit progresses with his purpose it
[1:08:11] brings changes
[1:08:13] he can't remain the same in Christ
[1:08:17] you must change from glory to glory to
[1:08:20] glory like I said the other day you
[1:08:23] plant a seed in the ground and if it has
[1:08:25] life in it it's going to change as long
[1:08:29] as the sun is shining as long as you get
[1:08:31] water and nourishments it's going to
[1:08:34] change and then at the end of this
[1:08:36] growth
[1:08:37] it'll never look like the seed that was
[1:08:40] planted
[1:08:42] the glory of the the tree is more
[1:08:46] beautiful than the seed
[1:08:49] and think about all of the seeds that
[1:08:51] was in that one seed how many apple
[1:08:54] trees came out of that sea and how it
[1:08:56] continued how it continued how it
[1:08:58] continued that is why
[1:09:01] Israel was so important it was so
[1:09:03] important for Israel to keep the
[1:09:05] bloodline and the seed going
[1:09:08] because once God cut off the seed it's
[1:09:11] done
[1:09:13] annihilated if you want to say
[1:09:16] but his love keeps us
[1:09:19] his grace Keeps Us
[1:09:21] His Grace Finds us
[1:09:24] his grace picks us up when we fall
[1:09:27] his love for us amen like I said is
[1:09:30] glued to us I'll never leave you nor
[1:09:33] will I forsake you hey and and he didn't
[1:09:36] say he didn't give us Con well if you do
[1:09:37] this to do that no he gave Abraham an
[1:09:41] unconditional Covenant I will
[1:09:44] make it happen
[1:09:46] Hallelujah and if God promised you to
[1:09:49] Rapture he will make it happen it has
[1:09:52] nothing to do with you it's all about
[1:09:55] him
[1:09:57] right it's the life that's in the tree
[1:10:00] or the light that's in the seed
[1:10:04] it is this is why God said remove the
[1:10:06] fear
[1:10:08] God don't want us fearing him that was
[1:10:10] under the law
[1:10:12] he taught us what death was like under
[1:10:15] the law
[1:10:16] you got to do this you got to do this
[1:10:18] you got to do this you got to be perfect
[1:10:19] and this and that and the other and
[1:10:21] listen on the Sabbath day don't you move
[1:10:24] you understand me that whole law system
[1:10:27] was fear
[1:10:29] but the Bible said when Jesus came he
[1:10:31] brought Grace and Truth
[1:10:34] Hallelujah why because he was the Divine
[1:10:37] love of God wrapped up in human flesh
[1:10:40] and he amen died for your sins
[1:10:44] ah do you you really believe that
[1:10:47] he died from your for your sins
[1:10:50] that is such a revelation that we
[1:10:53] sometimes let skips our mind slips our
[1:10:56] mind if we want to say it like that
[1:10:59] because you know we we allow the devil
[1:11:01] to put us in a a mood of sadness and now
[1:11:06] now what I'm saying is is because I've
[1:11:09] experienced it I go through things that
[1:11:11] you know and it's only because amen
[1:11:14] somewhere we moved away from the mirror
[1:11:16] we moved away from the word we allowed
[1:11:19] Satan to break bring a disconnection
[1:11:21] because as long as you're connected to
[1:11:24] God you'll have joy
[1:11:26] unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:11:29] it's the disconnection
[1:11:32] is when we began to look at ourselves
[1:11:34] and not at the cross of calvary
[1:11:39] see but the natural man receiveth not
[1:11:42] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:11:46] they are fooling just unto him neither
[1:11:48] can he know them because they are
[1:11:50] spiritually discerned but he that is
[1:11:53] spiritual judges all things yet he
[1:11:57] himself is judged of no man
[1:12:01] so your judgment toward a man who is
[1:12:03] spiritual is of no value
[1:12:07] and what we fail to see is that the
[1:12:10] Bible in itself
[1:12:14] gives us the solution
[1:12:17] the solution to the whole equation in
[1:12:20] order to love God you must have God
[1:12:25] the Bible says who for who have known
[1:12:27] the mind of the Lord that he may
[1:12:30] instruct him because we have the mind of
[1:12:34] Christ but we have the mind of Christ is
[1:12:37] that right what is the mind of Christ
[1:12:39] but the Holy Ghost what is the Holy
[1:12:42] Ghost but God himself
[1:12:44] that's why as a man Jesus said I can't
[1:12:47] do nothing except I see the father
[1:12:50] do it
[1:12:51] he worketh and then I worketh hither
[1:12:54] right right now Paul was saying this
[1:12:58] this this Mighty mystery is such a great
[1:13:01] thing to me and you know this is why the
[1:13:04] people of God was so in love with God
[1:13:07] Amen entrusted him so much to when they
[1:13:10] were being persecuted by the Roman
[1:13:12] Church and brought in the Arenas and
[1:13:15] lions and all that kind of stuff was let
[1:13:17] loose on him y'all remember the history
[1:13:19] of that how many babies women children
[1:13:21] and all ran toward the Lions
[1:13:26] in the Smyrna right ran toward the lion
[1:13:30] knowing that they were going to die but
[1:13:33] they trust the word because Jesus said I
[1:13:36] am the resurrection I am the life right
[1:13:39] they so trusted that word till they knew
[1:13:42] that if they die they'll live again
[1:13:45] Hallelujah and what's wrong and and all
[1:13:49] those who were involved did not
[1:13:51] understand they were really opening up a
[1:13:54] doorway
[1:13:55] for those true saints of God to move
[1:13:59] from this Dimension into the dimension
[1:14:02] where Jesus says he was going
[1:14:05] see that's how it is you think about you
[1:14:08] know uh
[1:14:10] I said like this what would we do if it
[1:14:13] wasn't for the Book of Job
[1:14:18] now how many of y'all you've read Joe
[1:14:22] and you've been inspired
[1:14:25] by this man's attitude and love for God
[1:14:30] and he loved God
[1:14:32] took his family God took his housing his
[1:14:37] land his servants God stripped him so
[1:14:39] naked and then out they made him naked
[1:14:41] he allowed boils and all kind of stuff
[1:14:44] to form on him and he loved him to the
[1:14:46] end
[1:14:48] you know people say oh I just get angry
[1:14:50] with God what stay away from me
[1:14:54] you get angry with God it's because you
[1:14:56] don't have an understanding of who God
[1:14:58] is
[1:15:01] I've heard people say that I'm saying
[1:15:03] I'll be honest with you
[1:15:05] I don't understand that
[1:15:07] oh that's like getting mad with somebody
[1:15:09] who who's done nothing to you
[1:15:12] and you don't understand it's been God
[1:15:15] all along that's been keeping that Old
[1:15:17] Devil away from you
[1:15:19] that's been protecting you
[1:15:21] that comforts you when no one else can
[1:15:24] comfort you
[1:15:29] Ephesians 1 9 through 14 have a maid
[1:15:32] known into the mystery of his will
[1:15:34] according to to a good pleasure which he
[1:15:37] have purpose in himself and my thing is
[1:15:39] this his purpose was to bring forth of
[1:15:42] his kind like our brother said last week
[1:15:45] and just to think that you wanted them
[1:15:48] one of them
[1:15:51] of his kind do you really believe that I
[1:15:55] do I don't fully understand it I don't
[1:15:58] know how he's going to have make it all
[1:16:00] happen but he promised me
[1:16:03] either that started the good work in me
[1:16:05] will finish it
[1:16:07] right now in this dispensation you and I
[1:16:10] are hearing things that the early church
[1:16:13] has never heard and probably wouldn't
[1:16:15] have understood it if they had heard it
[1:16:18] because the mystery of this thing was on
[1:16:21] the in the Gentiles the Gentiles the
[1:16:24] dogs of the Earth
[1:16:25] God chooses us
[1:16:28] to place his seed in US
[1:16:31] to bring forth His image
[1:16:34] come on somebody when you think about
[1:16:36] that why should we fear him we should be
[1:16:40] groveling at his foot feet loving him
[1:16:43] every day of the eye and you know what
[1:16:45] I'm I'm guilty this is what I'm
[1:16:48] preaching Lord I Want to Love You More
[1:16:52] when our brother
[1:16:54] was singing and he was in that phrase
[1:16:57] where you everything to me are all you
[1:17:00] that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:17:03] he's supposed to be our everything
[1:17:06] and we're living in an age of Technology
[1:17:08] where technology is stealing our time
[1:17:12] stealing our uh attracting us and we we
[1:17:16] get into a place amen we we lose
[1:17:19] connection with God because of
[1:17:21] Technology
[1:17:22] now come on somebody amen
[1:17:27] and if we fail to see this is what what
[1:17:30] what has been prophesied because we
[1:17:33] become loyal lovers of of ourselves and
[1:17:36] lovers of material things and lovers of
[1:17:39] God
[1:17:43] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:17:45] of time he might gather together in one
[1:17:48] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:17:52] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:17:56] him
[1:17:57] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:18:01] inheritance being predestinated
[1:18:03] according to the purpose of him who
[1:18:06] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:18:08] his what will so what you going to do
[1:18:11] with your will
[1:18:12] bow down humble yourself to the will of
[1:18:16] God
[1:18:17] right if it's his will for you to go to
[1:18:19] a Calvary experience amen
[1:18:22] if it's his will for you to have a a a a
[1:18:26] Stephen's experience amen
[1:18:29] if he is his will for you to be thrown
[1:18:32] to the Lions you see what I'm saying
[1:18:34] that's very difficult for the carnal
[1:18:36] mind
[1:18:37] comprehend
[1:18:40] that God will cause allow those kind of
[1:18:44] things to happen to the people that he
[1:18:47] said he loves
[1:18:48] but you got to understand you are the
[1:18:51] glory of God
[1:18:53] that you could love God no matter what
[1:18:56] he causes to come upon you you love him
[1:19:00] still
[1:19:01] no wavering I love him still
[1:19:11] in who we have obtained an inheritance
[1:19:13] being predestinated according to the
[1:19:16] purpose of his will who worketh all
[1:19:18] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:19:19] and let me tell you something God has
[1:19:21] helped us
[1:19:22] the ages before us they never had a
[1:19:25] prophet to come back say oh I was there
[1:19:27] they never had a prophet say oh oh I see
[1:19:30] you over there
[1:19:32] I've seen you there were millions of
[1:19:34] people
[1:19:35] uh innumerable people amount of people
[1:19:38] they never had that to say
[1:19:41] other than Joshua and type
[1:19:43] when they crossed the Jordan they went
[1:19:46] over there and says hey
[1:19:47] we bringing back this fruit the land is
[1:19:49] real
[1:19:50] well we added Joshua to go into that
[1:19:52] land the spiritual land which is
[1:19:54] greatest greater
[1:19:56] and come back and said hey the land is
[1:19:58] real
[1:19:59] but he comes back and tell us one thing
[1:20:03] only perfect love
[1:20:07] will make it
[1:20:10] he gave us the key
[1:20:12] to eternal
[1:20:14] understand
[1:20:16] [Applause]
[1:20:18] where no hatred
[1:20:20] no Envy no Strife none of this nonsense
[1:20:24] that people allow themselves to fall
[1:20:27] into none of that
[1:20:29] it ain't an ego trip no egos are there
[1:20:32] the only thing that's there is Christ
[1:20:35] right because when they saw the lamb
[1:20:37] those 24 Elders what did they do did
[1:20:40] they stand up and pump their chest out
[1:20:42] no saw the Bible said they took off
[1:20:45] their crown and they fell to the ground
[1:20:48] to worship God and to say Thou Art
[1:20:53] Worthy because they realized without his
[1:20:56] love without his doing the work in them
[1:21:00] because it's always been Christ whenever
[1:21:03] you are successful it's always Christ
[1:21:08] yeah and they recognize that but let me
[1:21:13] tell you something when you really love
[1:21:15] God
[1:21:16] every word almost that comes out of your
[1:21:19] mouth will be to God be all the glory
[1:21:22] oh brother you sang so well yeah giving
[1:21:25] God all the glory
[1:21:27] oh brother you preach I've had people
[1:21:29] say ah time about a preacher a preacher
[1:21:32] and I thought I'd be thinking to myself
[1:21:35] oh who is the preacher but Jesus
[1:21:38] but we we're so easy to give men the
[1:21:41] glory that belongs to God
[1:21:43] and it's always good to commit people
[1:21:46] but let me tell you something every
[1:21:48] anointing
[1:21:49] whether you be a horn whether you'll be
[1:21:52] a flute whether it be a piano it's one
[1:21:56] person playing it
[1:21:58] and that's God
[1:22:01] that piano ain't nothing if there's no
[1:22:03] one to play it or that horn or that
[1:22:06] trumpet it's nothing unless there's
[1:22:09] somebody to play it and I'm gonna tell
[1:22:11] you something even the prophet of God
[1:22:12] said I'm waiting on him
[1:22:14] you hear what I'm saying and it's that
[1:22:17] love and how many of y'all have felt the
[1:22:20] presence of the Lord when the god comes
[1:22:22] in what happens love comes with it
[1:22:26] if somehow you seem to love everybody
[1:22:28] even if it's just for the church time
[1:22:31] but that love amen you feel it and you
[1:22:34] go out smile and you're happy and oh God
[1:22:37] bless you brother God bless your sister
[1:22:38] that's just the four days
[1:22:42] of what is going to be like and it's not
[1:22:46] worth anything to miss that
[1:22:50] and for those of us who have been
[1:22:51] elected to make a Rapture you will not
[1:22:54] miss it
[1:22:56] first Peter almost done
[1:22:58] First Peter 1 2-9
[1:23:01] elect
[1:23:02] according to the knowledge of God the
[1:23:04] Father
[1:23:05] through sanctification of the spirit
[1:23:08] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[1:23:11] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and
[1:23:15] peace be multiplied isn't that amazing
[1:23:18] he just told us
[1:23:20] we elected told us how we were
[1:23:23] Sanctified by the spirit told us amen of
[1:23:26] how the we obey and you say what do you
[1:23:29] for a long time I've heard brother
[1:23:31] random say it like this he said you know
[1:23:33] uh
[1:23:36] perfect perfect perfect obedience if I
[1:23:39] make quit misquoted me or know what I'm
[1:23:40] talking about will entitle you to
[1:23:43] the Holy Ghost to the token
[1:23:47] you know if you if you if you kind of
[1:23:50] mind it you know what you you're going
[1:23:52] to try your best to be perfect
[1:23:54] in yourself
[1:23:56] but then you know where he takes you to
[1:23:59] Acts 2 38.
[1:24:01] that's your perfect obedience when
[1:24:04] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:24:05] Jesus Christ follow your mission of your
[1:24:08] sin he promised you to give you the Holy
[1:24:10] Ghost
[1:24:11] because what are you doing
[1:24:12] acknowledging that you need a savior
[1:24:15] acknowledging that Jesus Christ is your
[1:24:18] savior and that is a perfect obedience
[1:24:23] it's not
[1:24:25] crossing the t's and dotting the eyes
[1:24:29] Jesus did that for you he became your
[1:24:32] sin that you might become his
[1:24:34] righteousness
[1:24:35] we must clothe ourselves with him not
[1:24:38] with our own self
[1:24:40] which brings us back to the the the the
[1:24:43] spirit of fear
[1:24:45] oh Lord if I do this I I'm going to be
[1:24:48] lost or what happened to the preacher
[1:24:50] who bacheled oh God became a drunkard
[1:24:53] died
[1:24:55] and was saved
[1:25:00] his ways of past finding out
[1:25:03] and everybody want to put them put
[1:25:05] everybody in hell and you didn't get you
[1:25:07] didn't make one
[1:25:09] foreign
[1:25:15] call the kettle black we all Sinners
[1:25:18] saved by grace
[1:25:23] listen it goes on to say blessed be the
[1:25:26] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:28] which according to His abundant Mercy
[1:25:31] have begotten us again unto what Lively
[1:25:35] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] from the dead now the dead hope not the
[1:25:41] church is all dead and you know what I
[1:25:42] mean it ain't got no joy no this is a
[1:25:45] lively hope
[1:25:47] I hope they're supposed to have life to
[1:25:49] it
[1:25:51] yes sir to an inheritance Incorruptible
[1:25:54] undefiled and that fadeth not a way
[1:25:57] reserved into heaven for who you
[1:26:02] who are kept by the power of God through
[1:26:05] faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:26:08] revealed in the last times wherein a
[1:26:12] greatly rejoiced though now for a season
[1:26:14] if need be your heaviness through
[1:26:17] manifold Temptation listen
[1:26:21] the trial of your faith
[1:26:24] here you go
[1:26:25] being more precious than a gold that
[1:26:28] perishes
[1:26:30] though it be tried with fire
[1:26:33] might be found and to praise and honor
[1:26:37] and Glory at the appearance of Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ
[1:26:42] peering of Jesus Christ the this is what
[1:26:45] he's looking at
[1:26:46] how are you going to behave yourself
[1:26:48] while you go through your trial
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:55] now I promise you y'all got some of
[1:26:57] y'all got some trials I would never want
[1:27:00] and I'm glad you guys would have
[1:27:02] designed for it not me
[1:27:05] but at the same time no matter what you
[1:27:07] go through you might go through
[1:27:08] something like somebody said everybody
[1:27:10] has their own personal cross
[1:27:14] like they said in that old song no cross
[1:27:16] no crown
[1:27:19] but you know the difference between us
[1:27:21] and Jesus the Bible said he endured the
[1:27:24] cross with what Joy
[1:27:27] and God expects us to do the same thing
[1:27:31] I can remember time and I'm closing with
[1:27:33] this I've got more scripture
[1:27:37] but I'll just close because it's
[1:27:38] Wednesday night I I say this I remember
[1:27:40] the time and then the old Apostolic
[1:27:43] Church moving from Fear To Love
[1:27:46] moving from fearing God to loving God
[1:27:50] because in that love God the fear we
[1:27:54] have is a reverence
[1:27:55] not a terror
[1:28:00] no no no it's a reverence
[1:28:04] but I remember old saintly woman going
[1:28:06] on to be with the Lord
[1:28:09] assisted in the church
[1:28:11] told a lie on her
[1:28:14] and the LIE got back to her
[1:28:18] and you know what she did
[1:28:20] she began to rejoice and jump up and
[1:28:23] down and praise God that she was found
[1:28:27] worthy
[1:28:29] for that trial
[1:28:31] and she never spoke evil about the
[1:28:34] person who told the LIE
[1:28:44] may God help us all people we've got a
[1:28:47] long way to go but a short how can I
[1:28:49] want to say we got a long way to go let
[1:28:50] me not say that but I'll say it like
[1:28:52] this the coming of the Lord the
[1:28:54] translation is so close
[1:28:58] it's going to take more than just works
[1:29:03] we got to love him
[1:29:05] connect to God by love and not by your
[1:29:09] service
[1:29:10] though we all appreciate the services
[1:29:12] that people do around here that's not
[1:29:15] going to get you where you need to go
[1:29:17] we've got to love God
[1:29:19] and love it with all our heart our minds
[1:29:22] and our soul
[1:29:23] that's it
[1:29:25] it ain't about how many quotes see the
[1:29:28] quote scriptures that know everything
