have your seats amen just want to greet you in the name of the Lord amen from Tucson Arizona Tucson Arizona amen where uh we just we just came through summer very hot obviously amen but we enjoy the fall weather the weather was warm here this is awkward you see hey man I don't like the coals amen so we're grateful for that and something is on hey man I I think it's been uh six or eight years since I was here last season amen and there are many new faces amen and a few and a few old ones yes amen but we appreciate God's mercy we're just here to worship God together amen and to give honor to his name amen I've I've known our brother Isaiah for many years amen and he's a dear friend um amen so it's a privilege to be here with you and and I guess I guess he's uh feels the same because he just left me here so I guess that's trust right amen but we just appreciate him amen you have a good pastor hey man you should thank God for that not everybody can say that man so you thank God and do all you can to help him amen do you believe that you feel that way this morning amen praise the Lord Roger well I had a subject to preach to you on my heart this morning that I was intending to preach and then this morning the Lord changed it I guess I had even given the brother a title that's not the title anymore we just trust the leading of the Lord amen you know I believe that you get out of the service what you put into it and so if you are expecting to hear from God Amen then you will hello it's based on your expectations okay I don't know how to say it in French either but it's expectations amen it's you drawing from God what you need amen like the woman that touched Jesus garments she touched him with a different kind of touch everybody was touching him but she had a need amen and she pulled from him what she had needed amen and Jesus is the same this morning amen and you can touch him amen and you can pull from him what you have needed amen and if you do that amen then your expectation will be met you believe that amen he can be touched this morning amen and he can speak to you from his words amen praise the Lord Roger amen let's stand this morning we'll read the scripture I'm gonna take my jacket off if that's okay amen I never could preach with a jacket on amen praise the Lord Dodger hey man let's turn to the Book of Numbers amen and um maybe I'll just read it and then you read it after me is that all right yep okay we're gonna read the 13th chapter numbers just like to speak to you this morning about The Showdown at kadish okay numbers 13 verse 1. and the Lord spake unto Moses saying send out men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man and everyone a ruler among them and Moses by the Commandment of the Lord sent them from the Wilderness of Paran all those men that were heads of the children of Israel and these were the names the tribe of Reuben shamua this the son of zakur the tribe of Simeon shafat the size of the son of hori the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of jafuna the tribe of issachar ilgal the son of Joseph the tribe of Ephraim O'Shea the son of nun Tribe of Benjamin palty the son of refu the tribe of zebulun gadiel the son of sodi the tribe of Joseph namely the tribe of Manasseh Gadi the son of Susi the tribe of Dan Amiel the son of gamali the tribe of Asher sether the son of Michael the tribe of naphtali Navy the son of voshi the tribe of GAD who well the son of mahi and these are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land and Moses called oshia the son of none jehoshua and Moses sent them out to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them get you up this way Southward and go to the mountain and see the land what it is that the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that dwell in whether they be tents or strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean and whether there be wood therein or not and be Cur of good courage and bring the fruit of the land and this was the time of the time of the first ripe grapes be there through the 20th movies um foreign foreign amen amen now you might say why did you read all the names do the names really matter but they are witnesses and they're going to give testimony and so their names are recorded just like your name amen let's bow our heads father we love you this morning and Lord we thank you so much for your grace and mercy to us Lord we just invite you Lord to come and speak through your word this morning Lord speak to our hearts Lord go right around our minds and speak directly to our hearts Lord give us living word I pray oh God may your Holy Spirit just anoint us to speak and to receive your word Lord to move where you move Lord to follow your leading just perfectly father Lord may you be glorified Lord as we surrender ourselves to you now foreign amen amen so God has given us these Old Testament stories as examples to us amen there we don't we're not of the law amen we're not an Old Testament people but the Old Testament speaks of our experience the people in the Old Testament lived out their lives as symbols and what they experienced in the natural shows a type of what we experience spiritually Israel is a type of the believer Israel and they were called out of Egypt a type of being called out of the world Amen they heard a message of a prophet amen that called them out said come out of her my people amen be not partakers of her Amen to receive salvation amen amen but then he took them in somewhere Elizabeth amen the whole purpose of bringing them out of Egypt it wasn't so that they could wander in the wilderness it was so that they could go into the land that God had promised us and that land is a type of the Holy Ghost it's experience it's a type of a spirit-led life see living by the Holy Spirit amen because in that land they trusted God Amen in that land they didn't they they didn't have the great benefits of a river like they did in Egypt in Egypt they lived by the Nile River and because of that River they had great wealth they were able to grow crops they invented great forms of irrigation using the river it was all because of their intellect and and men's devices but in the promised land they didn't have that in the promised land they had to rely on the rain from Heaven they had their rely on God supplying the rain just when they needed it for their crops and it's a type of a life led by the spirit of God no longer are they walking based on their own understanding and intellect but in this promised land they would be walking by the spirit so that's what God intended for them amen and they were coming up to that they were coming up to a place called amen and they were coming to a decision a showdown amen and we have many times like that in our lives and the decision that they were going to make was going to affect Generations after them amen it was an important decision and sometimes in our lives we have those times when we have to make a choice amen things are building and building up to a place whether you're going to accept God's word or not the decision that you make will affect your children and your children's children every time we come to church every time we hear the word of God we have a choice we come to this place where we make a decision am I going to accept it or reject it because too many times people say yes I believe it that's God's word amen the word in church and then they won't walk in it after church amen Eve came to that point in the Garden of Eden that's God's word and Satan came to tempt her and gave her a perverted form of the word only changed one little part and she had a choice do I walk and stay with the simple word that God has given me amen or am I going to go with my reasoning amen am I going to let the devil talk to my mind and question the word and of course we know what she chose and we know the consequences amen amen Jesus had a showdown amen he was in The Garden of Gethsemane and he said Lord not my will so he had a will he had a choice amen amen but he surrendered his will but he didn't have to he had a choice amen his whole Ministry built up to that Showdown the final point where Victory would be won or lost amen and he laid down his will and he said Lord thy will be amen we brother sister will not get by with anything less amen we come to the place where we have to surrender our will because we've been given a choice amen Amen brother Brandon called it free moral agency amen a place where we can make a choice and the choice that we make determines our Eternal destinations so this is the type of decision that Israel is up to is is going to make they were on the very doorstep of receiving their promise amen a promise that God had made to their forefather Abraham when he called him out all those many years ago he showed him the land that he was going to give to him but now his children his descendants we're being told to go walk in the promise amen it wasn't enough just to say yes we're the children of Abraham we have a problem they it was their time to walk in the promise oh brother sister we've been given so much amen we've received so much words amen but we've got to walk in it amen we've got to cross over and walk in that land amen amen so knowing that that that this they had they had come out of slavery in Egypt where they didn't have a choice now they had a choice amen and they had come out under many mighty Miracles they saw the power of God on display right they saw Moses doing Miracles their prophet of the day amen he was he was showing them that God was on the scene things that they had heard in the past that Jehovah had done for Abraham and Isaac was now coming to life again no God was real and that his promises are true amen amen so they came out of that slavery and rejoice think about this their daily bread was Miracles amen every day they receive their daily bread they saw powerful armies defeated Pharaoh's Army destroyed they had a cloud and a pillar Affairs amen I I'm saying this because I want you to understand this was a powerful move foreign amen they hadn't even received the promise yet but yet they were part of a powerful move of God amen amen you see Jesus when he was going around walking as a man he preached and talked about casting out demons and he talked about the power of God but he said this was he said if you cast out a spirit that spirit will go and it'll walk in dry places right and then it will come back to the person and and finding the house swept and cleaned right he'll come back with some of his buddies and the state of that person will be worse than it was at the beginning why because nothing came to fill that person the demon was cast out but I want you to see that there's power amen even before the spirit or the promise comes coming out of bondage amen there's power in that yeah coming out of Egypt forth from demon powers is powerful amen amen Jesus said you shall receive power from on high after the Holy Spirit has come upon him so they had power before they cast out demons but then Jesus said you'll have power after the holy spirit so what power was he talking about good question they already had the power to do all those things so what was the power it was the power to live in the spirit amen to walk in the word amen amen Abraham was promised that they would have a land of rest the power of the spirit is walking in rest though the world is falling apart around you the power of the spirit is walking in peace amen no matter what the circumstances are amen that's power beyond just casting out demons amen it's power to give the word Life to Live Like Jesus amen so that promised land is a symbol of that power Amen brother random said this and I won't quote it but it's this is just paraphrasing he said that the promised land is God's promise to the church to live in the power of the spirit amen amen not being pulled by any wind of Doctrine am I not being pulled by the world no longer relying on the flesh no longer relying on our own strength amen but living in the power of the spirit amen we we enter in and we stop wandering around we stop looking for God because we're walking with him amen we've met him personally when we enter that land amen and he places Us in that land he settles us down amen and and we're not we're not running from this place to that place anymore but he shows us what amen he shows us our place in the kingdom of God he places Us in the body of Christ amen and we have a peace and we're settless amen all of this was waiting for them hallelujah amen but they had to choose none of them had ever seen it not even Moses he hadn't crossed over he hadn't seen it with his own eyes he was allowed to go up on the mountain and look across but he didn't get to set foot in that land and so he was just telling them about it none of them knew amen but he was giving them the word of God and telling them about what was their promise so they had to walk by faith amen amen they had to trust that word to walk into their promise so they came to the Border and that border the Border was the Jordan River right and that river is a symbol of death is crossing over you leave the old behind so in this case it's death to yourself amen it's not you dying physically but it's an old man dying and a new man being reborn and that's what they were facing fast and they had to decide is it worth it to go across the excuse me amen is it worth dying to everything that that I've wanted and dreamed about amen is it is it worth letting my dreams fall to the floor maybe everything I wanted as a man in life am I willing to give it all to God die out to my own ideas amen lay myself on the altar give myself completely to him it was just a crossover Nature has to die is it not true amen amen it's a sacrifice so they came to that Choice the pillar have fire had led them to that point and then he was waiting to think they would do I mean you see I'm sure they can follow that Pillar of Fire all through the Wilderness but he only brings them up to the choice it's up to you amen we can preach about it all we want amen and we can we can lead you to the truth but every individual person amen must cross over on their own they must choose to die out yourself amen they must choose to allow that old sin nature to be killed um to cross over into that land so they had no evidence but they had some witnesses and they chose these Witnesses and you know they they chose the the best men among them amen amen God always has Witnesses amen so God LED Moses to send some men to spy out the land is and he gave them two tasks one check the land so look at the soil and the water man look at what is produced there and number two check out the inhabitants right what people are there are they in the cities or in the countryside what are we up against amen that's what he told those witnesses that was their job now they knew the word of God right oh what an honor to be chosen for that task they would be the first one to lay eyes on the promised land amen amen they weren't to take possession of it yet but they were to experience it and to Bear witness of what they saw amen amen hallelujah amen Witnesses they were to speak to the others about the promise and and tell them what what they saw what the experience amen and brother sister every believer is called To Be A Witness we are to take the promises of God and experience them amen and then tell others I know God is real well how do you know because I've experienced I know him [Music] he speaks to me I know he's a Healer how do you know he's a Healer because he healed me [Music] that promise has been made alive to me amen and I'm a witness that it's true I'm not just speaking about someone else's experience but a witness is someone who has first-hand experience amen tell us about this God that you know but brother sister there's too many people amen that claim to have an experience amen they claim to speak for God if but they haven't crossed over they're just speaking about a promise amen but they've never met him themselves you can't talk about that land unless you've experienced amen too many standing on the other side speaking about that land over there amen instead of living in the land and saying listen man I'm living it is so these Witnesses were supposed to bring back this report and come back and tell the people how the promise is real and I imagine when they came back the people were excited amen what's it like all that we've heard are the prophecies true tell us what you saw they went to spy out the land for 40 days people waited for 40 days waiting for their testimony amen what they would testify is really important right amen and there's a lot riding on your testimony too amen you represent him amen amen if somebody hasn't experienced the goodness of God if they haven't experienced the power of the Holy ghosts those that have are the only proof and their testimony is important they represent him amen amen so they wait in anticipation a generation of people for years they've longed to be in the land remember great grandpa spoke about it and here we are right on the the very border of it amen waiting to cross over hallelujah hallelujah and finally the spy's return and they begin to give their reports amen and now you meant to know they're going to have two choices amen we're always given two choices because brother sister if you don't have two two choices then there are there's no choice if you only have one choice that's not a choice right God God had to allow the LIE so we could choose the truth so now they're going to have a choice the spies admitted the land is good this is amen they all they all Testify the land is good like God said it's a good land flowing with milk and honey amen but man amen amen but me there's trials there's things there that I don't think we can overcome yeah amen it's gonna be hard I I don't see how we can do it there's Giants amen now they were testifying mostly truth the land's flowing with milk and honey the promise is true what God said it's all there and there are giants there true there's trials there's things to overcome yeah there's a battle to be fought yeah all true but then you hear Satan's voice starting to enter in now there was ten against two yeah brother sister that just seems like it's always the way Satan's voice is loud sometimes he likes to shout amen and when you're in a trial let's take sickness your symptoms are shouting at you amen the word of God is speaking that God is your healer but the symptoms seem to shout the loudest maybe I'm the only one amen it seems like the devil's always shouting amen the perversion of the word is the loudest voice so whose report do you believe amen wow are you gonna believe the the ten or the two so the ten said yes it's beautiful it's wonderful but we can't take it hey man amen just one little change it's all true but it's too hard we can't do it we can't take it and of course you know the story Joshua Caleb they stood up and they said let's go I don't see why are we even waiting here God has given it to us they said let us go at once and take the land yeah and he said what about the Giants God gave us that land it belongs to us it doesn't belong to the Giants amen amen can I read you some things from the message just for a moment here I'd like to just one more morning to read a couple I'll have them here so you can look at it if you want okay so Moses this is from questions and answers Moses said to the ten tribes he'd send a man out of each tribe to go represent and spy out the land to see what kind of condition it was in um now if that isn't exactly up to your place this morning where you come today the church has come through justification through Luther this is sanctification through the Methodist and now up to the time of the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is Promised all through the Old Testament and the new too it says he said the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for the church amen that's his promise for you this morning is to live in the power of the spirit free it's another world it's another land not be you have to come out of the conditions that you've been in come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise amen amen to receive that promise amen amen the spies said and I'm just going to paraphrase these scriptures he said surely that land flows with milk and honey but the people are strong that dwell in the land man they're world cities they're fortified amen amen it's gonna be hard do you see you're gonna have to bear a reproach amen you're gonna have to die out you're gonna have to leave behind your old ideas now I'm gonna bring this home a little bit here this morning because brother sister many in our own message are sitting at the border they've followed this message their entire lives [Music] and haven't crossed over maybe they never heard it preached maybe they've never surrendered but many many sit at the border and they're in the message following the message of the prophets amen hey man sit on a message Pew listen to the tapes but never crossed over you can have all the I call the trappings but all the things of the message know all the language amen no the quotes have come out of Egypt come out of the world been Sanctified amen amen living a Sanctified life but not crossed over yet not living in the spirit amen and those Believers that are in that conditions amen they're missing that life amen amen hallelujah now we we went through this at our own home church we had many young people but there's just as many older people they admit I've never been baptized in the spirit now I was raised in this message I was five or six years old when the message came to my family my father so I grew up listening to the tapes amen and and living a good holy life going to church Faithfully amen if you were to look at me you'd say man that's a Believer and I was a Believer amen I was saved and sanctified but I began to realize and see in the word I wasn't living in the spirit I needed to come that last step hey man it didn't matter how long I have more complete amen I wasn't walking in the spirit oh sure I was spirituality went to church sing songs amen I think I was even a song leader for a while amen amen I hate to say this but our churches are filled with them said they're in every Church we have a choice when we hear the voice of God are we going to follow all the way The Showdown is on the spectacular when you hear a witness and I'm a witness this morning I'm here to tell you the land is good I'm here to tell you there's power in the Holy Spirit I went from a young man who lived a holy life just by my own strength to a man that lived a holy Life by the power of the Holy Ghost amen I'm here to tell you that the land is good that the promise is true I'm here to testify this morning amen that The Grapes of the Lambs oh they're sweet Brothers they're good amen they're the biggest grapes you've ever seen I'm here to tell you there are giants in the land hey man I'm here to tell you that it is a fight it is a battle but I'm here to tell you that there's a power to overcome amen you will not overcome laodicea without the spirit of God that is the power to overcome amen amen that's what we need in this hour and they said no those Giants are stronger than we are so hello they are stronger they're bigger they're better equipped they're better arms they've got walls but God is with us hallelujah amen but that wasn't their testimony they said we can't do it it's okay to be weak and to admit you're no match for the enemy amen because leaning on your own strength leads to defeat amen but Caleb and Joshua weren't looking at their own strength is they were looking at the promise amen I don't know how we're gonna take the land but God promised it it's ours it belongs to us I'm gonna trust him I'm gonna trust his words Hallelujah amen oh hallelujah amen he said the the people are strong in the land and Caleb stealed the people and said stop let's go at once I don't see amen amen let's stop messing around here amen with our message denominations amen this message has become this group versus that group denominational men's ideas amen but that doesn't mean that men around the message can't have a denominational spirit and that Spirit comes right in is amen amen let's forget all that stuff let's live in the spirit if you're trusting God you're not worried about all those things you're not worried about what people think amen amen one of the most beautiful things that God did for me in this message there are so many false things floating around the First shows excuse me but they're weird ideas lots of weird things and you're you're if you try and figure it out on your own I hear this preacher prominent preacher over here saying this and then there's this move over here yeah and they seem to be gathering people right in this move over here they've got this happening they say they're riding they stay there they say they're right if you try and figure that out on your own with your mind you will fail usually you will be talked into this using your mind your strength amen and I experienced that as a young man but God through his holy spirit amen when he came and baptized me in his Spirit he spoke directly to me amen and he promised that he would lead me and guide me and he gave me a piece in the middle of all kinds of false doctrines because you see one of the things that they use is fear if you're not with us you're not in the prize if you don't see my pet drockton You're Not Elected right and they use that fear and without the Holy Ghost you can't combat it it's only sentence but once you've met God once he's coming sealed you in you know that you've met him face to face you know that you've crossed over Jordan then somebody comes and tells you if you don't see this you're not elect I'll say well if God needs to show me that yes if I need that he'll give it to me [Music] because I trust him and I know him I'm in a relationship with him I speak with him every day amen We're In A Love Affair we're walking together amen amen we're close I mean we're close so if I need something I know he's going to give it to me I don't have to be scared into something I don't have to be ashamed into something now I don't mind scaring you or shaming you into wanting the Holy Ghost once we have that there's no more fear if you're still in the winter Wilderness you have a right to be afraid but once you crossed over then you can say God is with me I don't fear any Giants I don't fear any devil the Lord is with us that should have been their testimony he's brought us through the Red Sea amen he's shown us Victory after victory we don't have the ability but God is with us amen so they were showing their Revelation their level of revelation oh my God hallelujah amen praise the Lord Roger so the Bible says they brought an evil report um listen to this this is this is numbers 13 32 and I'm not just gonna read it for you just going to paraphrase it to you they said they brought they brought an evil report and maybe you hadn't seen this but they said that the land is eating up the inhabitants it wasn't just the Giants it wasn't just the walled cities I said the land is eating up the inhabitants some sort of disease right amen eating up the inhabitants and I imagine it's afraid right but that doesn't phase a Believer because they're not looking at that amen and I want to point you to something later in Joshua 24 12. after they had crossed over and were in the land and they were taking possession they were fighting battles he says this he says I sent the Hornet before you Hallelujah which draved them out before you do you see that here they were afraid because they were seeing things in the land right disease or maybe they were seeing killer Hornets in the land and it made them afraid to go in but that very thing God turned around and used it on their enemies you understand what happens when the Devil Comes against a child of God it turns around on him amen it backfires on him amen all it does is draw a child closer to God foreign amen [Applause] get his wings singed a couple times and you think he'd learn if yeah I'll do foreign but the men said you know those giants we're like grasshoppers in their size well how do you know how do you know that they think of you as grasshoppers maybe they're afraid of you how do you know the demons are looking at you like we can take them no problems maybe when the devil says go go a child my my son my daughter you may last time look what happened I got sent back here with my tail between my legs amen amen defeated thank you don't send me after them again maybe that amen that demon that's sitting there that you're afraid of it amen they're trembling because you're reading your Bible to cast them out those demons that were sitting there in Legion saying don't come on Jesus have you come already Amen to torture us before our time amen amen huh right they were afraid of him they were they were they were like man we were having such a good time and a child a Son of God showed up yeah I'm feaster driven here amen maybe those giants were afraid of them Hallelujah but it's a bluff brother sister Satan is a bluff he has no power over the child amen all he can do is talk you out of your promise amen and they were afraid of the moving of the spirit that's what that Promised Land represented it represented an old-fashioned Holy Ghost Pentecostal experience he just used the p word amen I don't apologize for it you should I say this I know your password amen it's become a bad word in many messages we're talking about the experience of the Holy Ghost experience the life of God and people are afraid of it the very thing that was sent to save them and to deliver them amen demons being cast out people screaming and shouting getting the victory amen the very thing that was sent to save you that's the very thing people want to bind up and keep out of the church amen they want to put a wet blanket on a service and they don't want the spirit moving in the services because their flesh might have to die the uncomfortable brother Adam said that they were snotting bawling Pentecostal babies right amen why your flesh doesn't enjoy that your flesh doesn't enjoy uh dying out your flesh doesn't enjoy losing control but your soul rejoices amen when the spirit of God begins to move your soul is being ministered to you hey man your flesh says oh my back is tired my knees hurt um Lord I need more amen I'm fighting a battle today I've got Giants before me I'm taking possession of what you gave to me Lord but I need more of you Lord I need more of your spirit amen amen but you see it's like Samson the voice to come some song Sampson was sent to the people as a deliverer all right he was specifically Chosen and and created by God to be a deliverer in this specifications amen and do you know that he was bound and handed to the Enemy by his own people the ones that he was sent to deliver they bound him up and gave him to the enemies amen that's what people do with the Holy ghosts they bind up the moving of the spirit amen they they say oh that's for an age pass it is or that's for babies we have so much more Revelation now we're so far beyond that amen they're so far beyond it in their own intellect that they've missed it completely amen we do have the revealed word we do have amazing insight into the Bible we have things that the prophet brought out of the scripture that just make your head spin um but none of it matters without the spirit to make it live amen I'm sure you've met them I've run into people that are so revelated that they revelated themselves out of life so intellectual amen resting on their understanding of the message instead of the spirit of God moving in their life amen I I believe in reading the word amen and I study the word amen but it doesn't do me any good without the Holy Spirit coming and anointing that word amen amen in our services we can preach preach and preach but it doesn't matter unless the holy spirit amen and moves on our hearts it makes it real why because he is a person amen amen this is about a person the person of the word brother random preached the Mighty God unveiled before us what was it it wasn't so that we could take this verse and tie it to this verse over here it was so we could know the person oh Hallelujah to know him but know him as he really is to walk with him like Enoch walked with him my hand in his and his hand in mind my mind amen and just like Enoch us where he walked with God and had fellowship with him one day God said you know we knocked just that one take one more step just come on up come up higher amen amen it's a person that we're talking about here amen the person of our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen I don't even know how long are we yeah okay amen amen Hallelujah we'll try and wrap this up somehow Hallelujah brother random says in the smyrnian church age Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the holy ghosts but the people stop there they go as far as the water and stop they believe and then stop right the Bible does not say that when you re you receive when you believe in it is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe me you see people seem to forget this in this message I'm a message believer I've been baptized have you received the Holy Ghost since amen amen he says the exact and literal translation is did you having previously believed received the Holy ghosts but he says the people believe and then stop it now he's not just talking about 1960. this is now he says you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost that's wrong with our fundamentalists and we have fundamentalists in this message he says they have no power for they stop short of Pentecost they're like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped short of the promised life those children of Israel left Egypt about 2 million strong phone they all journey together all saw the same miracles massage amen amen all partook of the same manner they've heard the same tapes water from the smitten Rocky I'll follow the same Cloud by day in the pillar of Fire by night but out of that two million brother sisters only two so do reach the promised land true or real Believers that is correct is it correct because the word tells us the rest died because of unbelief because of unbelief they could not enter in yeah amen since this is so it comes and only two entered entree then the rest were not true believers a True Believer is filled with the spirit is free amen amen what made the difference he says to stay with the word now the others on the other side when I said we're following Moses message that's exactly what he said but they weren't doing what he said they were saying what he said if this is not doing what he said the two stayed with the word when the hearts of the ten spies failed at kadish this is Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the words and they said we are more than able to take the land they knew that they could because God had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw of the power and goodness they couldn't say God wasn't a Healer they couldn't say God wasn't with them all that they had seen and the Deliverance of God they did not enter into rest foreign so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way all the way to receiving the spirit of God amen Jesus has crossed death and he proved that the resurrection is true yeah he has resurrection power we prove that the word was true amen amen we've seen the evidence he's the evidence of the Resurrection we we have heard Witnesses my life was changed I was religious before but now I'm spirit filled we've heard the witnesses and then we now we come up to our decision our Showdown amen will we take the way with the Lord's despised few construation die out to our flesh and walk in the spirit amen amen laying our lives down maybe you're at the border this morning I'm here to tell you it's for you amen it's for you maybe you have crossed over but you lost sight you're in a battle you're gonna still be in a battle but it's your land that's your promise amen amen don't let anything stand before you brother random tells the story of a man His Name Escapes me at the moment being over 40. I'll do that uh he was seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he got to a place of desperation and he said Lord if you don't come you're gonna find me laying here a pile of bones right because he had gotten to a place where he didn't care about anything else and brother as as a minister I can tell when people are serious about God because they don't let little things get in the way amen if someone is really seeking God we were talking about baptism yesterday if someone has a revelation that God has given them that they need to be baptized they do not care if the water is cold or hot in regards shoulder they know that they need to do that they're not worried about you know is it going to be sunny right that's not on their minds something is stirring in their heart saying I need God and I can tell when somebody is seeking the Holy Ghost if they're just coming at it very casual right well if God give it to me it's okay if not you know this is life without that you will not go in the rapture amen amen it's serious and you can tell when somebody is on the right track because they're they're of one mind singleness of heart amen they start to get an attitude like Caleb and Joshua had yeah this is my promise I'm not gonna let all these other distractions keep me from it I need this I know I mean maybe I've played around with it in the paste put a smile on my face but deep down inside I know I need God Amen and I'm not gonna let anything stand in my way the kind that's on the right track when you're going to receive the promise amen you know people that complain about things in the church I know that their hearts aren't right amen all that preacher preaches too long we might be there this morning I don't know I don't like the songs that the song leader saying if you're entering in the spirit you don't even worry about this you've come to meet with God oh the seats are too hard now look your flesh will still do that confession is good for the soul I come to church and sometimes the seat hurts right the preacher preaches too long amen the the building is too hot but through the spirit I just tell my flesh to shut up and I don't let those things hinder Israel let's party that's not the realm that I'm living in I'm living in the promised lands and I've come to meet with God and to hear from him that's what it takes to get the Holy Ghost she's seeking Four Points of others and discipline you've got to be all in amen I'm leaving everything behind nothing in my life matters more than this when you get to that place in your life I'm ready to cross over I'm leaving everything behind that's when he'll start to move it's for you this morning amen healing Belongs to You Deliverance belongs Jesus purchased it for you amen amen amen and the Beautiful Thing brother sister is you're not going alone they weren't crossing over to face those giants alone Jesus is going with you and he's never been defeated and he never will be defeated amen you sell but not
