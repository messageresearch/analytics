[54:46] of israel

[54:50] i am the first
[54:52] and i am the last
[54:55] and beside me

[55:46] angel of the laodicean right
[55:50] these things says
[55:52] the amen
[55:54] the faithful
[55:55] and true witness
[55:57] the beginning
[55:59] of the creation
[56:12] if i was to entitle this message
[56:28] my
[57:37] foreign
[57:47] [Music]
[58:05] i like to encourage
[58:13] [Music]
[58:25] [Music]
[58:32] pay attention to the word of god
[58:48] liberty
[58:49] [Applause]
[59:15] i'm so glad we
[59:19] [Music]
[59:33] [Music]
[59:44] and when
[59:57] jesus christ
[1:00:10] christopher
[1:01:09] he's not referring just to elijah here
[1:01:13] he's referring to elijah
[1:01:17] jesus christ
[1:01:19] she will be an invincible army
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:02] no i understand
[1:02:30] in the scripture don't is it true
[1:02:33] where
[1:02:35] revelations third chapter said jesus
[1:02:36] christ is the beginning of of the
[1:02:38] creation of god
[1:02:43] reading that scripture you can so
[1:02:45] misunderstood what's being said
[1:02:53] but there is a purpose there's a reason
[1:02:55] why the scripture
[1:02:57] is true it's actually uh saying it the
[1:03:01] way it's being said
[1:03:04] and we need to know what is being said
[1:03:08] hallelujah he is the bride of jesus
[1:03:10] christ
[1:03:12] as we call her
[1:03:14] it's not a
[1:03:30] and now we're in the 8th
[1:03:33] but i want you to understand
[1:03:36] the principle in which i'm going to uh
[1:03:38] minister this morning
[1:03:40] and i've always used it
[1:03:43] maybe not saying it
[1:03:46] but i always use the alpha and the omega
[1:03:48] principle
[1:03:51] what it was in the beginning
[1:03:54] it's what he hears in the ending
[1:03:56] hallelujah and we're serving a god
[1:04:00] that changes
[1:04:03] god doesn't change because of our
[1:04:05] attitudes
[1:04:06] he doesn't change because of our
[1:04:08] indifferences
[1:04:09] he doesn't change because
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:23] the prophet god began to explain
[1:04:35] but those words don't mean exactly as
[1:04:38] they sound to us
[1:04:42] just taking them the way they sound
[1:04:45] has made some people
[1:04:49] multitude of people
[1:04:51] get the idea
[1:04:53] that jesus was the first creation of god
[1:04:57] making him lord then god had
[1:05:00] lord and godhead
[1:05:04] and i know that some way some of us
[1:05:06] think
[1:06:29] that he is the creator
[1:06:32] he was the creator
[1:06:34] of a finished
[1:06:36] physical creation
[1:06:40] hallelujah let me keep reading here
[1:06:43] because i want you to understand if you
[1:06:45] if you can't see jesus christ as god and
[1:06:48] i'm not talking about in your mental
[1:06:50] capacity
[1:06:52] you've got to have a revelation
[1:06:56] in order to understand who you are
[1:07:00] hallelujah oh i'm so tired of seeing a
[1:07:04] weak holy ghost while on sentence
[1:07:06] prefabrication the holy ghost is not
[1:07:08] weak resentment
[1:07:09] is god
[1:07:14] [Applause]
[1:07:40] without
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:20] this is a different designation
[1:08:35] people
[1:08:48] are still feeling sorry for ourselves
[1:09:15] see the bride of jesus christ
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:10:00] you shall live also
[1:10:02] amen and he says i am
[1:10:05] the resurrection
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:10] and that same i am
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:28] and i know we do it sometime when we get
[1:10:30] tired
[1:10:32] but we get into sad mood
[1:10:36] and when you move into that sad mood
[1:10:39] you have literally moved out of heavenly
[1:10:41] places
[1:10:54] that we have we are now sitting in
[1:10:58] heavenly places
[1:11:00] christ jesus or jesus that means listen
[1:11:03] if you're truly born again
[1:11:06] god has moved you from the third
[1:11:08] dimension
[1:11:10] to that
[1:11:13] hallelujah
[1:11:14] oh glory to god
[1:11:18] so what are you saying brother bro
[1:11:20] you you got to stay in your dimension
[1:11:24] and the bible said in the presence of
[1:11:26] the lord there is fullness of joy
[1:11:31] at his right hand
[1:11:34] our pleasures forevermore
[1:11:36] listen that's the problem
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:49] i'm going to meditate on your word both
[1:11:52] day and night
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:34] because
[1:12:44] you need to tell the devil to get off
[1:12:46] your back
[1:12:48] you know
[1:12:57] i still love that scripture
[1:12:59] he makes all things beautiful
[1:13:08] [Music]

[1:14:05] heavenly bridegroom
[1:14:07] created his own
[1:14:09] bridesmaids

[1:14:46] hallelujah
[1:14:47] this has
[1:14:48] has to do with the church
[1:14:50] this is a special destination he is the
[1:14:53] creator of that church the heavenly
[1:14:55] bridegroom created his own bride
[1:14:57] as the spirit of god
[1:14:59] he came down
[1:15:00] and created in the virgin mary
[1:15:03] the cell from which his body was born
[1:15:06] i want to repeat that
[1:15:08] he
[1:15:15] it was not enough for the holy spirit
[1:15:18] to simply give life to human orbit
[1:15:22] um
[1:15:23] supplied by mary uh
[1:15:26] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:15:29] producing a body
[1:15:31] that would not have produced the last
[1:15:33] adams
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:50] mary
[1:16:26] some of us don't believe it i guess you
[1:16:28] don't heard it so many times
[1:16:30] but you know what the thing about it
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:43] you know and it's not even right
[1:16:46] for us to take this message
[1:16:48] and put our own signature on it
[1:16:51] hallelujah
[1:16:53] and you know we do it
[1:16:55] one brother come with this revelation
[1:16:57] another come with that revelation
[1:16:59] and all of a sudden it's their
[1:17:00] revelation
[1:17:02] no no no no no it never was theirs
[1:17:05] it was always god
[1:17:08] hallelujah amen just so you understand
[1:17:10] where god is taking us
[1:17:13] when the early church came through i'm
[1:17:16] going to move on when the early church
[1:17:17] came through
[1:17:20] it was a pure church
[1:17:23] they didn't have rituals
[1:17:26] they didn't have holy days
[1:17:28] there was no such thing as
[1:17:53] of jesus christ
[1:17:55] amen amen
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:35] that's why god's supposed to see jesus
[1:18:38] he said when i
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:51] i don't care what church
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:06] when
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:18] it's all about the baby
[1:20:02] 120 pieces
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:06] and the bible said it's set upon each
[1:20:08] and every one of them
[1:20:14] anyone talking about the room upstairs
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:42] christ wasn't the second person in the
[1:20:43] trinity
[1:20:58] manifested in three offices
[1:21:02] holy spirit
[1:21:03] same god
[1:21:05] doing a different work
[1:21:07] all right hallelujah was he not father
[1:21:11] when he came to
[1:21:12] israel you know he was a father
[1:21:15] because he treated them like a father
[1:21:19] like a father he put his pickles on them
[1:21:21] like a father
[1:21:24] father
[1:21:26] but when jesus
[1:21:40] jesus
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:06] let me move on
[1:22:15] you see
[1:22:17] one thing about god
[1:22:20] he always hides himself in simplicity
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:35] i know that jesus christ is the same
[1:22:37] yesterday today and foreign
[1:22:40] i don't like church energy i never had
[1:22:43] that
[1:22:44] i don't like it when people just come to
[1:22:45] church and that's all we do
[1:22:47] it's all a ritual we come into we sing a
[1:22:50] few songs we hear the preaching and then
[1:22:52] we go back out the door
[1:22:54] that's not it
[1:22:55] it's far beyond that
[1:22:59] the church of the living god in the
[1:23:00] beginning in the alphabet
[1:23:03] was so much like
[1:23:05] call them christians
[1:23:08] the same signs
[1:23:10] the same wonders
[1:23:12] most of all the same life you will see
[1:23:13] that y'all understand me
[1:23:16] okay let's move on
[1:23:18] so when jesus christ comes and he says
[1:23:21] i am the alpha and the omega that's fine
[1:23:24] i'm the beginning and the ending says
[1:23:26] the lord which is
[1:23:28] which
[1:23:29] which is to come the almighty god
[1:23:32] now you got
[1:23:36] hallelujah he's doing exactly what
[1:23:38] brother branham said he he was or who he
[1:23:40] was identifying himself
[1:23:43] when god gave the prophet of god
[1:23:46] revelations
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:00] he's the same
[1:24:11] and what we've got to get rid of is this
[1:24:14] system
[1:24:24] because it lessens
[1:24:26] you it lessens jesus
[1:24:37] and as long as you serve a week in your
[1:24:39] mind he's weak he will always be weak
[1:24:55] chose
[1:24:56] john
[1:24:58] and you know if you ever read the book
[1:24:59] of john
[1:25:01] john
[1:25:02] she god is a as a as a king an eagle
[1:25:06] he sees god is god
[1:25:09] you understand me of those living
[1:25:11] creatures he sees god it's god
[1:25:13] you see jesus christ as a word
[1:25:16] in the beginning of the word the word
[1:25:18] was with god in the world
[1:25:20] hallelujah you understand what i'm
[1:25:23] saying
[1:25:24] then john god uses who is the type of
[1:25:27] the bride
[1:25:28] hallelujah she sees him more than the
[1:25:30] sacrifice
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:33] she sees him more than just like luke
[1:25:35] saw him as a physician looks good
[1:25:38] y'all
[1:25:52] my
[1:26:07] and then he declared unto you that there
[1:26:10] was only one that sat on the throne
[1:26:14] he knew
[1:26:15] god was one
[1:26:17] hallelujah and no matter how many
[1:26:20] symbolism
[1:26:22] or symbols he did see
[1:26:26] he knew that every one of those symbols
[1:26:34] you know one thing about
[1:26:35] like the artwork it shows up
[1:26:38] when they design stuff
[1:26:41] they put their signature in it that's no
[1:26:43] sense like calvin klein
[1:26:46] hallelujah
[1:26:47] that's what jesus did this
[1:26:50] he put his signature that that's just a
[1:26:51] popsicle when the when the work was
[1:26:53] finished
[1:26:56] in the book of revelation when the word
[1:26:57] was finished
[1:26:59] he said i am the alpha let's just do
[1:27:01] that and the omega
[1:27:16] and there is
[1:27:29] and this is where we go wrong
[1:27:46] make us think it's supposed to be less
[1:27:50] but that's not scripture
[1:27:54] it's not scripture
[1:27:56] elisha
[1:27:58] did twice
[1:28:00] the amount of miracles elizabeth of
[1:28:03] works
[1:28:07] but what you know what it is so we want
[1:28:09] to ride in
[1:28:11] on elijah's life
[1:28:14] you can't do it
[1:28:16] you got to have your own
[1:28:18] people who fell for somebody is that
[1:28:20] right anyway that's why elijah said to
[1:28:23] elisha
[1:28:26] see me go
[1:28:39] hallelujah
[1:28:54] a
[1:29:09] he was able to wear it he picked up the
[1:29:11] participant wait a minute
[1:29:13] gee you got to understand do they come
[1:29:15] home you know you got the power
[1:29:18] the same holy ghost
[1:29:21] remembered elijah
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:36] we don't
[1:29:50] let me get you straight on that this one
[1:29:52] if brother branham was here
[1:29:54] he could have he could do nothing for
[1:29:55] you
[1:29:59] you you said what do you mean brother
[1:30:01] there were people who came to brother
[1:30:03] branham and they wanted him
[1:30:23] [Applause]
[1:30:27] hallelujah
[1:30:34] see the alpha omega the alpha
[1:30:37] uh ministry was so powerful
[1:30:41] i know i can't go through all my notes
[1:30:42] so i'm gonna have to
[1:30:43] cut something short he said the alpha
[1:30:45] amin the alpha ministry
[1:31:00] coming out of catholicism but they're
[1:31:02] coming out of the law
[1:31:07] law law law that one and one you gotta
[1:31:10] understand
[1:31:12] the law was a stronghold
[1:31:14] the law
[1:31:23] hallelujah think about it
[1:31:26] like god is trying to get us to see
[1:31:28] junior we want to
[1:31:41] let me say it like this
[1:31:43] you see
[1:31:44] they were so locked into the law
[1:31:47] when paul said
[1:31:50] you don't have to circumcise anymore
[1:31:55] they want to kill him little trick
[1:31:58] you mean who do you think you are
[1:32:03] you understand me who do you think you
[1:32:06] are
[1:32:07] you gonna tell us
[1:32:10] and you worshipping a god called jesus
[1:32:14] who was born of fornication
[1:32:17] hallelujah that's what they had to deal
[1:32:19] with the sickies of the affair
[1:32:23] and paul went on and said you know
[1:32:38] jewish people
[1:32:40] even among the christians
[1:32:43] some of them and most of them couldn't
[1:32:45] handle the teaching of paul
[1:32:51] paul says well they all have left me
[1:32:56] even demons my best buddy
[1:33:00] what was it
[1:33:02] it was too much
[1:33:05] but it was only for a selective group
[1:33:09] within the ephesus
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:20] hallelujah
[1:33:48] omega
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:34:01] hallelujah
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:15] god allowed him to do a lot of little
[1:34:17] things
[1:34:20] but these little things were dropped
[1:34:23] in place
[1:34:25] for us to see
[1:34:27] and understand what god is requiring
[1:34:30] from us
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:58] in one message well the man was talking
[1:35:01] about
[1:35:02] how he spoke to that uh fish
[1:35:08] and he said i turned quickly
[1:35:12] because they seen that god used me
[1:35:16] to speak life to a fish
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:24] the bible says
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:41] and now that sounds crazy
[1:35:44] but that's the same god it's a
[1:35:46] remembrance that spoke life to that dead
[1:35:48] possum doing that
[1:35:50] yeah
[1:35:53] but listen
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:19] [Applause]
[1:36:22] see i got some things to read here
[1:36:25] he's alpha in the maker
[1:36:27] the beginning in the end
[1:36:29] he's the life see some of you also
[1:36:30] comment your thoughts oh you're thinking
[1:36:33] i'm saying you got power on your own no
[1:36:36] no no no no i'm
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:50] am i right i got quotes for it but
[1:36:54] listen leo the seal was rejected
[1:36:57] but in rejecting laodicea
[1:37:00] there was a prophet
[1:37:02] had already planted seeds
[1:37:16] there's a new crop coming yeah
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:45] according to the word of god
[1:38:00] could
[1:38:13] this prophecy being fulfilled
[1:38:16] she was so filthy
[1:38:20] come on somebody she had rejected the
[1:38:22] word
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:27] marching to the tomb
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:41] he said
[1:38:42] is this all my message has produced
[1:38:46] he said but all of a sudden
[1:38:49] another group
[1:38:51] let me say it
[1:38:53] he said laodicea went down
[1:38:55] meaning she rejected
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:10] i
[1:39:23] organizations
[1:39:39] revelations 1
[1:39:41] 10 and 11.
[1:39:42] this is this is what our easter
[1:39:44] celebration is about so give me a few
[1:39:45] more few extra minutes
[1:39:48] he said i was in the spirit of the
[1:39:49] lord's day
[1:39:50] and heard behind me a great voice
[1:39:53] as of a trumpet
[1:39:58] i am alpha and omega
[1:40:00] the first and the last
[1:40:03] jesus
[1:40:05] what thou see
[1:40:07] is write in the book
[1:40:09] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:40:14] which are in asia
[1:40:16] which are in asia
[1:40:19] so here he goes again he what's he
[1:40:21] considering what is the reason why you
[1:40:23] know god is not a person that he's got
[1:40:24] to repeat himself over and over
[1:40:28] then the alpha and omega
[1:40:30] is something different from first and
[1:40:31] last
[1:40:33] because he makes a distinction
[1:40:48] distinguishing something
[1:40:51] he's making you see that there's
[1:40:52] something that he's doing
[1:40:56] and he wants you to see what he is doing
[1:41:00] listen
[1:41:05] in the sixth verse
[1:41:08] and he says unto me it is done
[1:41:11] in my decision i am alpha and omega you
[1:41:14] see that the beginning and the end
[1:41:17] i would give unto him that is the thirst
[1:41:20] of the fountains of the water of life
[1:41:23] freely
[1:41:25] he didn't say i'm going to do it
[1:41:28] he said it's done
[1:41:39] right
[1:41:40] and so when we say okay alpha and omega
[1:41:44] zone
[1:41:59] declaring himself he is with the clown
[1:42:01] remember
[1:42:02] of who he is
[1:42:05] in the church
[1:42:07] amen remember
[1:42:10] the bible tells us
[1:42:11] that it was jesus christ walking through
[1:42:14] the midst of the golden candlesticks
[1:42:18] hallelujah
[1:42:19] he understand me
[1:42:21] he started at ephesus
[1:42:24] and he ended up where at least
[1:42:41] dude dude
[1:42:42] god would bring a bride into you know
[1:42:46] convocation
[1:42:48] the first day
[1:42:53] but let's go back to the first
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:08] they were naked and didn't know it
[1:43:11] because they were clothed
[1:43:13] by the glory of god
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:30] yes paul touched into that one time he
[1:43:32] says i want to make sure i'm clothed
[1:43:36] i don't
[1:43:48] he said i want to make sure i got a body
[1:44:07] and if you don't hear this message you
[1:44:09] have nobody to be clothed
[1:44:16] hallelujah
[1:44:20] even some of the earliest messages
[1:44:25] he talked about jesus christ being a to
[1:44:27] z
[1:44:29] and i'm going to read a quote to you
[1:44:31] in the message amen the seven church
[1:44:33] ages
[1:44:36] he said a voice of a trumpet
[1:44:38] saying unto me
[1:44:40] i am alpha animal maker
[1:44:42] now this is in 54.
[1:44:45] he said the first thing out he said he
[1:44:46] introduced here
[1:44:48] i am
[1:44:50] the first and then let's see what i'm
[1:44:51] saying he don't need voices of course
[1:44:53] he's pronouncing to you
[1:44:55] i'm eternal
[1:44:57] really first and last is time
[1:45:00] but really he's
[1:45:14] and he said
[1:45:29] uh god began to unfold to him things
[1:45:31] he's never seen before
[1:45:38] he was progressive in his revelation
[1:45:42] there were times
[1:45:58] he said just before
[1:46:00] the last church age
[1:46:03] which was pentecost
[1:46:05] it's the lukewarm see
[1:46:10] leo
[1:46:22] listen closely as jesus was seen in the
[1:46:25] cross
[1:46:27] standing in the seven golden
[1:46:29] candlesticks
[1:46:33] the darkest was that was the farthest
[1:46:36] away from him
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:52] that part
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:06] to look upon as alpha and omega
[1:47:11] everything in between
[1:47:13] didn't look like him
[1:47:15] didn't act like him
[1:47:17] produce jesus like alpha and omega did
[1:47:48] the
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:48:01] we cannot
[1:48:03] live without we're in between people

[1:50:59] see
[1:51:00] i'm going back to the old testament so i
[1:51:02] can re-emphasize
[1:51:04] this says the lord the king of israel
[1:51:08] and his redeemer
[1:51:09] the lord of hosts
[1:51:11] i am the first
[1:51:12] i am the last

[1:53:07] read enough of them

[1:56:27] in the distance
[1:56:29] the world council of churches do not
[1:56:31] understand
[1:56:32] the concept is that the bride of jesus
[1:56:34] christ
[1:56:35] reacts better when she's under pressure
[1:56:40] and the pressure is coming
[1:56:42] and not only is there pressure coming
[1:56:45] from the anointing
[1:56:49] is that right

[2:09:47] there's only one righteous and that's
[2:09:48] jesus christ
[2:09:51] and what makes us righteous is because
