ran off from the house without my Bible but by God's grace we got her done as we stand excuse me glad to see everybody tonight we ask that you turn with us the Saint John the tenth chapter we'll begin reading at the 27th verse of that chapter we'll read all the way down to the tenth a 30th verse then we'll go to st. John 8 and we read the 21st through the 24th verse of that chapter my sheep heareth my voice and I know them and they follow me that's very powerful I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave it me gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand it shifts it goes higher it becomes even more certain if you could put it that way st. John 8 21 through 24 then said Jesus again unto them I go my way ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whether I go ye cannot come now here he talks to one group of people and he reassures them that no man can pluck them out of his hands and here's another group he's telling you look for me and you can't find me and and you won't be able to go where I'm going Lord Jesus then said the Jews will he kill himself because he said whether I go you cannot come and he says unto them ye are from beneath now he's telling them why they can't come because you're from beneath I am from above he are of this world I am not of this world I said therefore to you that ye shall die in your sins but if ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins let us pray father God we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and father I pray that you would bless the service tonight in a special way cleanse us from all unrighteousness and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated it's so amazing that we are who we are but we are who we are by because of the grace of God God is a God of contrasts brother Branham has reassured us is his messages over and over and over again that when God gets ready to do something Satan who is the adversary is always busy Paul talked about it he's talked about when I am there to do good evil is always present and you and I must know that we are in the age that is most evil of all ages this is the age in which they will crown Lucifer we see in the world of principalities and that's what the Bible tells us that we don't fight against flesh and blood but we fight against principalities and powers and I think some time is very difficult for people to understand that everything has a spirit behind it every motive every objective there's always a spirit either the Spirit is good or the spirit is evil and those things that so appeal to our eyes and our flesh often time are evil even though they may be beautiful I recall one time when we were in elementary and they were teaching us about the Venus flytrap which is a I believe it's tropical flower but it is a flower and this flower actually eats insects it is one of the few flowers that I know of that is if a guy said like this carnivorous it likes flesh and in what it does it sends out this nice odor and it's a pretty flower and it attracts but the intent of that odor and that beauty is to win the victim for maybe a new snack or evening meal and it's just kind of remind me of Satan in this world when we talk about principalities that's why we holidays and all of these things that we see understand that everything in this world is operating by the spirit of Satan God put in this particular RAM his own kingdom but outside of the kingdom of God is the kingdom of Satan and you know I was just talking to one of my children today I said you cannot expect the unconverted to act as if they are converted I said whatever the seed is whatever the life is in them it it must reflect itself and if a man is not born of God he is literally he's going to reflect Satan's attributes there is no way you cannot expect the world to love you and love their father too because their father is a murderer my point is I was trying to tell them I said you you make the mistake of trusting people in the world you got to understand when they're not converted they're not responsible for their behavior because they're not in control of their behavior and oftentimes we expect them to act like Christians and with respect and honor but you must understand those days over there was a time when when the Word of God even controlled the world-in-itself but we are now in Satan's Edelen he's controlling the people just by inspiration there is no respect for the word or the people of God and and so therefore that they they do what they want to do the every man has a right to do what he wants to do this is Laodicea the people's rights and so if they they want to act and do whatever they want to do they feel it's okay to do it if it's hurting you're feeling it doesn't matter you'll get over it see that that's that attitude and you and I must understand that and if Satan can be so prevalent and we can see him so well in the way people behave and the way people act we know it's the devil cause as soon as they do something you said you know that ain't nothing but the devil but we when we fail to see that when we say that we really giving honor to the devil because that's what he's doing it is he has acted in such a way I mean you're looking at a person but you've seen the manifestation of a devil in them I'm saying all of this to get to my topic if we are the Word of God and we are in the kingdom of God there is a way we must behave but this behavior cannot be by your might or your power the only way that we can ever enter into the kingdom of God is that you must be born again now a lot of people they think brother but you've preached this all the time but you see the kingdom of God is supposed to be like light night and day in comparison to Satan's Kingdom it should be in a way that there is no question you know when I see light I know it's light when I see something that is dark I know it's dark there's no confusion in my mind because the darkness itself is manifested and the light in the south manifested how you and I supposed to have a light in us that's brighter than the Sun is that correct it is absolutely the truth because when Paul was on his way to Damascus and the Bible said a light shone from heaven and that light was brighter than the noonday Sun see that is the kind of light that is supposed to be within us because that light he didn't recognize was the pillar of fire who was Jesus Christ himself so God put us in a dark place and God said in this day there shall be light in the evening time right the Prophet God said it'd be a dismal day in in between night and the breaking of a day but he said it's at that time God would bring a light that would be brighter than the lights being seeing you know it is early in the morning or late in the evening when it's getting dark that light and that darkness it'll blend and I don't know about you but I have a stigma so sometimes it becomes very difficult for me to see when I'm driving in that time of the day that's why I'd like to be either at home or somewhere stationary because I do I have a little trouble by God's grace but you see it's like this I can't control the graying of my hair's oh my head it is part of the process of dying so certain things that God allowed to happen to us will happen but in all of that the light of God is supposed to overshadow what death is bringing us subject the word itself revealed reveals itself I like that the word itself reveals revealed reveals itself I'm gonna say it again the word itself revealed reveals itself and this is why I read the scripture because here was the world of God standing in the midst of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they could not see him they saw a man that may have even known that he was Mary's son but they could not see God see and you've got to understand Jesus in and i'ma read that scripture he said except you believe that I am he you shall likewise die in your sins the difference between a wheat germ in a kookaburra is that a kookaburra is designed with unbelief a kookaburra has nothing in it to believe even though if it rains if it's thirsty to cry out for the glory of God but a conquer burrell cannot believe God now I work with people now see because remember a kookaburra is a symbolic or symbol of unbelief and the wheat germ is a symbol of belief if you are a wheat germ you are designed you have the power in you to believe the Word of God right because understand all rain comes for the wheat a kookabura is a symbol or for that which is backslidden that which is fallen it is a it's a thistle it is something that was in his original form something different but because of the fall realize now there won't be any cuckoo birds there and you must understand Amen that with the Bible begins to unfold itself it begins to reveal who is cocklebur and who is wheat it is able as the scripture says leave it when the wheat and the tares are sold together leave it until the harvest time and when the harvest time comes a man it will then the angel will then come and separate the wheat from the ten you know I wonder what people think that's happening where does that go that's happening now it is a message that seventh angel that God sends to separate the wheat and the tail the cocklebur from the wheat however you want to say it but this is the message God said leave it to win the harvest time then I will sit my angels everybody expecting to see angels and men with wings and everything else no the angel in the pulpit he is the one that is preaching the word that is going to separate the wheat from the chaff hello where the vellum says in the message faith is the son of God faith in the Son of God he says listen the worship are once purged has no more conscience or no more desire to sin and if you still have the desire you haven't been purged yet that's just one thing sure if you still have a desire this is what I love you said in your heart he didn't say in your head cuz Satan will always you're mine right he gonna come to your head but if you still have a desire in your heart to go out and lust and sin just remember my friend you need to come back to God back to the altar for we are sold with the incorruptible seed of God and ordinary an ordinary say grain of wheat won't perish if it's in the right kind of a ground how about the seed of God which is incorruptible it's got to produce just exactly what it says it will and listen a grain of wheat will never produce a kookabura no sir no a barrel will be in the field and when the drought is on the conquer barrel is just as happy to receive the rain that falls from the wheat falls for the wheat the rain that falls for the wheat and if the rains say the same rain but their fruit you'll know them see you'll know whether it is a kookaburra all wheat and if you still and if you steal that color in your heart and so forth unbelief see unbelief is all it is so if there is if you're not converted there's a Kaka birthday he's unbelief and the thing about it is only faith is a gift from God everything can worship God he says let everything that has breath praise the Lord but the Bible came to reveal it came to uncover what you and I were from the beginning it can't change you the gospel doesn't come to change who you are in your soul because in your soul you are either elected or you're not it came to reveal what was in your soul the seed in his self was shown before the foundation otherwise remember that you can take it all the way back to the book of Genesis God never changed the seas that were in in that darkness and all he did was shine light on the seed and the seed was what it was the light didn't change it it just unveiled what was under the darkness he see them saying see so when the word itself is revealed it it reveals itself it comes to manifest itself hallelujah and by light by the light shining on the seed hello but think about it three and a half years Judas with Jesus if any kind of transformation could have taken place it would have would have done it but the Bible said he was born the son of perdition Holy Ghost breathed on it receive either Holy Ghost hello he was justified he was sanctified the brother branham said he could not go to Pentecost ha because of who he was from the beginning hey am I making sense Steve so there are certain things that cannot be changed God does not have an eraser on the back of his pencil when it comes to the Lamb's Book of Life Book of Life is one thing the Lamb's Book of Life your name cannot be taken off you understand me God doesn't say well you've been so bad boy I'm taking your name off the Lamb's Book of Life no the Lamb's Book alive well little sealed the very means that was there so protected it was sealed hallelujah underneath the seventh seal it's amazing the Bible said even the world will wonder whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah not the bride she know her name is in the was was in the book lies Lamb's Book of Life why she heard him remember my sheep here with my boys and a stranger they will not follow listen show us the father he said then any divine promise of God is of God is a seed in an in divine promise of God is a seed and that seed is there in the right ground will produce his kind corn would bring corn barley would bring barley wheat would bring wheat and my divine promise of God would bring the results is if it's a place in the ground and there's water with faith prayer trust God shall bring it to pass he says I'm saying that from experience but there's no way that you and I will be able to tell God I trusted you and it didn't happen no such thing the fault will never be God's fault because God is faithful to his word hallelujah st. John 10:27 through 30 says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they know me now he's talking here's Jesus right now my sheep hears my voice I know them right and they follow me see you gotta understand Jesus amen he had such a knowledge and he knew his sheep because they would follow can you imagine James Peter John and all of them fishing come follow me he knew he knew at that moment they drop their nets he knew at that moment they would follow him he knew that when you heard the word you would follow him he knew it was a voice that drew you you didn't even understand it yet the voice caught you hallelujah and I give unto them eternal life so when the devil tried to tell you Elia you can't make it no no no not you you got a mixed-up devil he gave me eternal life I didn't earn it he gave it to me and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of mine I'm so glad about that because if he's got you in his hands there is no way any man can pluck you out hmm and he takes it even higher my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and then he breaks it down so you can easily see him he's revealing himself now I and my father Oh hallelujah there is no secretary or treasurer there is nobody you can government come to an appeal to because I am my father 1 we have the same mind the same existence hallelujah see so that word comes to reveal that's we don't see we don't see that the very separating of the wheat and death is happening right now by way of this message see here here we have an answer she don't want to make us think we don't have an answer but we have an answer we know what eternal life is and we know that we can only obtain see the body we are accepted in the beloved but what we must understand is that the beloved must accept you right ain't you accepting me love is to be loved it's accepting you and when he accepts you then you pass it ain't even based on your goodness it's based on your election come Oh Jacob was a shyster huh he was a shyster God even at Birth said no that's the one I'm old even though he saw as the firstborn Jacob will rule him I want him see see it's election why because we were in him he knew us when we were in him we may not have known him but he knew us and that's why you and I must understand it doesn't matter how dark it gets in this side on this side if God has already elected you listen you won't skip the process you won't skip one step God will if he doesn't lead you he would drive you like a cattle and he will bring you to perfection that is the word and we still to say thank you Jesus because he's doing the work I'm so glad I don't it ain't me uh you know I'm just here we're here he's using my body we'll think about it God is using your body that's such an honor that is such a glorious honor that out of all the dust of the earth God chooses to use your body the body he gave you the body he made see you and I must understand Isiah brother said I said I knew what it meant to be a prophet and he knew is going to take more than what he had to meet the answer of the day let me break it to our turn we know we are the bride but we know is going to take more than what we got to meet the answer of the day we know it there's no way we can sit back and say well yeah no no we're not where we should be we gotta have more it frightens me I was thinking about that today almost all day I think 3 o'clock in the morning I woke up and all I was thinking about was a dead church what makes us think we are alive the Pentecostal churches they got more action they got more noise they got more gifts they got more all of that and yet the Bible says they're dead spiritually dead yet it appears to be alive you have a name that you live but yet you're dead what what constitutes a dead church you know what it is when God leaves it and write it kabob you understand me now I think some of us would not be thinking oh well you know what about this you know what I'm talking about the church individuals individuals when God departs that's when you become a dead church when Samson knew that God was no longer with him he became a dead church but because he was elected God knows how to resurrect the dead mmm help us Jesus and so does it take it takes more than what we got Oh Lord today to meet the answer it takes the person of Christ within us he didn't say the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said the person of Christ justification make room for safe occasion sanctification make room for the path to the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost make room for the person of we cannot stop amen in order for us to defeat in order for us to come out as victors in this age we must have the person of Christ ruling in our lives we must we won't meet today what God is requiring from us we will come short if the person of Christ is not within us it takes Jesus himself to answer the question great Lord grant that the Holy Ghost in the person of Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost may come into every heart just now cleanse us Lord from all our unbelief clears us from our creeds and our foolishness of this world cleanse us from it Lord and put your word in our heart and meditate on it day and night may the answer come Lord as soon as the harder cleanse see the heart gotta be cleansed granite Lord laid the angel of God touch each one of our hearts now with the cola fire as we were waiting upon him Granite Lord see see you know if we're gonna be bringing into our our Commission you know we came to do what better than say the last that this Mount Zion showdown must have the person of Christ on the seat because Janice and jammer is going to be doing signs and wonders - when the squeeze come Janice and generous will be doing signs and wonders - but the difference is they have the person of Christ how is that right the difference between Janice and Jambres and Moses Moses was veiled with the pillar of fire hmm which was Christ himself see you and I must understand him and where we've seen people and this is why I was talking to the Lord as his Lord you know I talked to him whether he ever was gonna come back and say a word or two or not I talked to him I let him know he knows what's on my heart I said God the person of Christ is missing where is he even among the preachers if he's where is he Lord there's a God you know my thirst you know my heart's cry I'm not here for fame I'm not here for fortune and I don't care about that stuff I'm just here for one thing that God would occupy my body that he would lead and lead through in my heart in my mind well I have no thought of my own totally surrendered to him I want to see the person of Christ in these people Lord in this man that's what I'm talking about is it real is real have not God been been perfect in his promise everything God has promised he's brought it to pass this is not too hard for God but he's got to take us or it takes a surrendered heart it takes a man and a woman who's gonna be able or willing to say Lord take it all I'm just so tired of it taking all Lord I just kill me now made me I become another Isaac slain me that I might live again that you might live through me and this is what I'm thinking about I keep thinking I says Lord I said you know we were religious we have a good time your presence come in here I said but it's more to it it's more to it y'all hear me is more to it Satan challenges us I was reading quotes where brother man said I challenged the devil that was the person of Christ in him and that's where we must come to because we're coming to a place that's Satan's gonna bring that challenge but you've gotta have hearing you to produce an other challenge to come back at him Yanis famiiy is between good and evil it's between Micah and Lucifer Christ and Lucifer and you gotta have that Christ in you is that right Bell said you better let go over to these overseas places he said because the devil these witches will challenge you you gotta have Christ in you you can't go now talk to her brother today and his wife Tony say you gonna keep going over there she shouldn't see it this I say well you know people that just didn't seem too much television telling you keep going over there to them places they're gonna have your head in a pot but you know people still believe people still believe what they've seen on TV TV don't walk to everybody's mind civilization has conquered the world and they still thinking that you know of course there's cannibals in in places and I won't name these places you know what I mean yeah but you know you rarely hear if anybody's being stuff to the pot these days because see if God sends you he's going to protect you if this okay he says listen he said then said unto them I go my way and he shall seek me and she'll die in your sins let me move on down you and I must understand Corinthians says examine yourself whether you be in the faith prove your own self no II not your old self hello how that Jesus Christ is in you except you'll be reprobate know him you gotta know he's in you I hope no in that day you will know I mean the father the father's in me and I am you you and I must come to know he said except you be reprobate but I trust that ye know that we are not reprobates now I pray to God that you do no evil not that we should appear approved but we should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth so you can't do nothing about the truth truth is truth even Pilate says what is truth but he had to acknowledge to truth I find no fault in him this man is the holy man I find no fault in him he said he didn't know what truth he wondered and he and the truth comes out I find no fault this lamb is pure it's ready for sacrifice hallelujah it's ready to be offered up he's going for the whole judgment Hall to judgement Hall they examine him they examine him to see whether they could find a spot or blemish and the lamb comes clean no fault in him now he's ready to be crucified hmm see we must realize him and that the Old Testament was Christ it always been Christ Oh said Moses spoke rather let me see he he had the rod as an and in the author s he opened no man can do that that was Christ in the man Josh was a son Stanfill yes it was a man's voice but it was Christ behind the boys the Creator was in the man presence in Christ was in in Abraham Christ was in Isaac Christ was in Jacob Christ within Joseph Christ was in Moses Christ is in all the Old Testament in all the Old Testament and if we had time here seven years ago he's at last two months we've been on the exodus from one side to another try typing everything even the waters of separation the red heifer hello and don't you know israel just found a red heifer a red heifer without spot or blemish you know what the red heifer was all about being able to sanctify the people according to God's standard and process hallelujah and if the red heifer has come that means the Messiah is not far from hints Oh somebody help me here see the waters of separation they had to be burned it took our judgment and then made into the waters of separation and the sprink of the people after they had sinned and had gone outside the camp how did the hyssop in the cedar wood and all mixed together how did the wood in the dominica how the brazen altar the lava the shewbread everything pointed to Christ and in him we are complete hallelujah the laws we want to be complete Galatians says my little children of whom I travail in birth Paul was concerned about the Galatians you know Galatians you know they had gotten to the place they wanted to go backwards you know the lean circumcision and all that stuff he said he was concerned he says listen I'm working hard I'm working hard and then trying to bring you to her bad eye that's what he said he said of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you I want to see Christ in you not some law not some rule not some regulation I want to see Christ in you see that's what I'm saying that's what we want to see in this church let some rule some tradition formalism and all of that life Christ we should have even preached Oh love or anything if Christ is in here he will express himself he will reveal himself I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice five staying in doubt of you he was the prophet of God Paul himself talking to the Galatians I you know I wanna I wanna change my boss I know I'm screaming at you right now and I'm being forceful he said but but I have to be I want to change my boss but I stand out in doubt of you in other words I don't see Christ I don't see Christ in you I need to see Christ Paul was telling the Galatians I want to see Christ in you and I'm gonna continue to pray and pray and I'm gonna continue to rail it meant to some I see a breath come for Oh hallelujah see he's Paul was speaking he's speaking pretty hard to him but he says listen the world has been revealed but now I need to see the revealed the revealing of what was revealed I want to see the expression of but I want to see I want to see the manifestation of what's been revealed and that's all I'm saying the message that we reveal the thunders have honored that the seven seals have been open but I want to see the manifestation of what's been revealed that's what we want to see and if we're not careful people we will die if we don't move forward we must booth for every one of us must press it is a hard press right now it's a hard press it's a time where evident every devil in hell every principality is coming against you you can't go to the grocery store without seeing Phil everywhere you go Shaitan is is right at the door but you got to press you got to recognize who you are and understand I'm in another Kingdom this is not my kingdom hallelujah and I will not allow that evil Kingdom to pull me out of the one I'm into no sir my kingdom is eternal God's kingdom is eternal this kingdom will be done away with hallelujah see what the Prophet god says in all things he said God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explained it away and say it's for some other day or something how can god who wants to fulfill his word and perform his word going among the people and the people did 9 that he does it yet they go through all the rituals and see you got to understand people think I'm insane but I see conditions I see the conditions of people around the message I know I'm fighting I'm sure you're fighting you're pressing but when I go all over the message you know people are not they're not thirsting for God they got all the rituals they got all the quotes of william branham most of them don't know their Bibles hello I mean they got it all they look good but where is the Christ that was been revealed is that right the Bible said the token came in the evening time where is it where's the life right it's got to be seen it was brought here to be seen where in his people Christ unveiled in his people the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed that's who she is right he goes on and says when the church explained it away he said I'm saying oh yes the Holy Ghost without sensation but where is the person of Christ we have peeled the move of God because we say we don't want to be Pentecostal well you can never be bride without becoming Pentecostal first you must have the Pentecostal experience before you could ever go any further you don't jump from justification to the person of Christ or sanctification to the person of Christ you must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and by doing so then God God brings you to that person of Christ by maturing Paul said grow up into him stop behaving like children grow up into him here's what happened God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost into something how people even get him all stirring up I was telling brother Craig the other day when I was talking to him I said if the preachers are preaching a message to excite the people all they are actors the Word of God comes to bring conviction the Word of God comes to show the people it is the light of God that shines and cuts through every veil that you might see where you're standing it must bring conviction it must bring and thank you yarn if you come out of service and you're not yearning for more God the preacher fail because he didn't let go and let God God never fails but every man you say you get to oppression people than what we got it we got it Israel thought they had it and all they were was Pharisees they became actors performing for the audience of people and yet they got their hearts were too so far away from God am I right or wrong it is the mystery is reality oh yes they have to do not listen he said and the church wants to perform they have to divide denied the Holy Ghost they want to perform to make a big organization of wealth to bring membership no matter what you have to baptize sinners drunken bootleggers anything else and take them into the body of the church no wonder revelation 17 says this old prostitute woman that had a bunch of daughters that she was full of names of blasphemy named churches and daughters calling the names of daughters you know what I'm saying but understand people of God you and I don't ever want mercy to be removed from us now the way I preach is not so accepted around places but I could care less the Bride of Christ will here and my thing is when I see the struggle and I see all this witchcraft you know witchcraft is what really right brother branham said he saw the Church of America being led by a witch so witchcraft is the principality it is the power that's moving these churches right and it's the power that's moving a lot of people because if you find yourself being stubborn against the Word of God you have a witchcraft spirit something that is anointing you that will keep you away from the promises of God you have been bewitched and if you come to a place like the Galatians did who they thought Amen that if they went back to the law of circumcision the fleshly things amen he said Paul says but who happy which did you see it ain't about law it's about love it's about love he said if you love me you will keep my Commandments that's only stipulation God put on it if you love me you will keep my Commandments hmm when this reveal is revealed right I don't care if you got a bright light underneath the cloak once you pull that cloak off that light go ah that's what God God is saying listen I am revealed I open the seals I've taken I've loose them I've showed you your name is in the book shine for me try you come to shine for God different than anybody else in the world handpicked by the Almighty God to show forth in this generation that's what we are a special class of people but if that anointing right what did the angel do to Mary just Mary you're gonna have a baby there says how could this thing be seeing that I've never known a man and then the Holy Spirit said but the Holy Ghost in you let me preach it's going to overshadow you it's going to come right there and it's going to produce the promise and all Mary had to say was be it unto me according to thy word that's all if that's all the prayer you have you ought to say Lord be it unto me according to that word if that's all you got to pray pray it because you're giving God permission he's a gentleman whoever stands in the unity of God when God he says listen it's time that men and women woke up to the fact that we want to be one Jesus pray that we might be one just as God and him were one and God was in him and we are one with Christ if we let Christ come in but it's the only way we can do is to let him take the control room in our hearts then we become one if we become one we have no issues with each other unity is what it is I don't know what people think but even if we had a Judas I had some Judas's in here don't you know you still got to love them and don't you know Jesus never told anybody who he was the only person he told was John and that was just before the persecution my point is how could we make heaven you know we must understand this you know I've just got to love your family your friends your neighbors but you must love your enemies because God gave them to you hello you say oh I want to be like Jesus you can't be like that's part of that's part oh geez loving his enemy he loved judo so much who was his enemy he kissed him hmm he loved judo so much Amen that he kissed him and still call him friend would he knew that his commission was to betray him that's Jesus that's the person of Christ in you I don't trust him well you know what I'm saying what what about God you and I still working we're still pressing in to the place where God can trust us all of us this is okay I'm almost done second Thessalonians 1:7 through 12 this is my last grip chill y'all understand what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say tonight if the word has been unveiled if the cover is moved from the object that we're doctors hear it then once the light strike it the identification of what it is is now known see once the gospel light strikes you the identification of who and what you are is now known in the making sense see the light the darkness hit it when we were among the world in that darkness we all looked alike but when the gospel comes it it shines a light there and then it identified who you are there's no more cloaking everything is revealed the coin is revealed the weed is revealed the cocklebur is whatever you are is revealed by the message of the hour now it may be in a place you know if you're not truly converted doesn't mean that you are not wheat the problem is you must become converted and if God has set you in this gospel this gospel came to convert you and the only way that you'll not be converted is that you don't believe that you can be see that's the attribute of the cocklebur but you've got to push over that that's what so you got to be born again hallelujah is that right cuz brother Branham said it like this he said in the midst of the kokuboro was a wheat germ hello meaning that we came into this world hybrid Oh hallelujah the outside look like a cop tomorrow but on the inside was wheat I'm almost done starting at the seven verse and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flames of fire taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ you said well Judas knew God he did not he knew of him had he known it was God he would have never betrayed him he didn't know him Peter knew it even though he was still a shyster when Jesus said you gonna go to Peter says Lord where we gonna go you're the only one that has the words to eternal I see you and I who really know this message is true you know you can't go nowhere cuz you know this is the only words to eternal life you know it nobody can II can't can't can't explain it away from you you know it that is a revelation God gave you I'm gonna hang on in there if there's a such thing mmm I'm not holding him he's holding me who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence women in flaming fenders taking on those that know not God and that obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ what is the gospel of Jesus Christ you must be born again that's it's the only thing when Peter preached he preached Jesus and then when they said men and brethren what shall we do repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of his sins and you shall receive the gift of the whole that is the gospel the death burial and the resurrection and if you can't preach the resurrection you've got to live it the resurrection is alive that cries it's a sign it's a witness that Christ that once was dead is now living in me Hey who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired whoa I love that when he shall be glory come to be glorified well in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and in the work of faith with power that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may be wet glorified in you y'all see what I'm saying the whole point I was being here is that God would be glorified in us it's time to stop looking at what Paul did and what John did and what Moses did and what Joshua did God want to see what you do he want to do it in you wasn't enough to be done when God wants it to be done through us not some past history he is alive today gotta be more it is more and those who hunger and thirst for more will be filled I can't thirst for you but each and every one ought to be thirsting for more God and what does God do to make you thirst show you your failures he show you your failures right if you got everything sweet you you know what I'm saying but when he throws some salt or something in there Amen it makes you thirsty for what something sweet and you not know we know but every day God shows us failures after failures I know maybe some of y'all have gotten to the place that you don't fail but I do I do hello I do but you see is not a counted as failures because I'm justified but I see what God brings me I see what I do and yet I am under the blood of Jesus Christ and my desire is to be just like him I don't even know what that means yeah understanding me it's a level of God I won't I know it's there for me you got a nose there for you I don't care if I don't become appalled as some great men of God if I'm just a preacher and all you see is God like I said with that later on that plane say what does that look like that's a lot and she said it like that I'll never forget that that wasn't me she was looking at that was God you don't know how that blessed me you don't know how much that stirred me to know that God you know how can I say it identified himself with me that was his identification not me whatever she saw was beyond flesh I didn't ask him all I did was listen I was listening brother branham I was listening to his tape trying to stay in tune with the word didn't even know that God was there like that y'all know what I'm saying little things like that little things like that my even sounds strange I was talking to brother Jarrett today and he's been really busy and working and stuffing he said I was telling about my my situation there on the plane he said you know what it's so funny he said brother it was a day job he said the time you told me you was leaving and everything he said I was praying for you cuz I had a sense that something was gonna go my wife was praying for the Brad Burgess was praying because they felt like something wasn't right y'all understanding the whole stage was caused by God people were praying for me when I didn't know they were praying I'm not trying to be anything but Jesus that's all I want and that's all you ought to want I'm not here to be glory a glorified I'm not trying to get into glory I'm not trying to sound like I'm more spiritual than anybody else cuz I am NOT if you go into this line they're mine per day you'll see the battle said you wouldn't like them it's reality it is reality and as long as you've got this flesh you gonna have the battles it doesn't mean you're gonna lose but you have the battles I'm almost done right wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill the good pleasure of his goodness and work of faith with power that's what I'm talking about that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye and him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ one of the things that got me stirred up because of my daughter I see the devil using her and I'm like Lord what that shouldn't even be because I know she's in prison and she don't want to be where's the power of God God is dealing Sonny you don't mean you're not people in this church they you know they know how faithful but how many really praying for her and thirsting for more god to make to get to a place where that demon has to go it can't be just a daddy y'all understand I'm saying this is a warfare and the attack is not all kinda the attack is on this assembly it is but everybody don't be the judge is not by husband in the Kalina in their family it is in your family it's more than your your spiritual family in your natural and I'm not saying this because I'm talking about other people who's left here I pray for still to this day Lord let him return but I say you know what God I need more of you I need more of you I'm not gonna stop if I lose my mind doing so whether it be for Shekinah or whoever else I'm tired of the devil playing with us like the Philistines did Samson making sport that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified we're in you and ye and him according to the grace of our God and our Lord Jesus Christ and you know what I know you and I cannot work on our own Jesus says I can't do nothing except the father show me but the point is I want to be right there so when he does if he choose to I'll be able to act and do what God wants me to do you understand me right you're listen he goes says and you're Abraham's seed when you are dead in Christ all of all friction static tuned out your motives is one your hearts one and you're in you're one with Christ amen what he says it's first and the rest is of it it's nonsense that's all you take his word for it right that's in God's covenant in other words God's Word take preeminence is number one and everything outside of that becomes nonsense last day let us pray father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your amazing grace we love you lord I love to see this church get to a place Lord when sin comes in everybody would fall into fasting and praying until it's revealed what the cause is Jesus that's what brother Branham said when he said the early church would would not allow things to happen they loved each other so much that they would pray and seek your face until you would give them an answer where is that Christ lord help me and help the people of God in this place Lord it's time out for Satan and his sporting himself among true believers I pray that you give us more fire more authority I know you can't give it to us Lord because he's already given to it but give us the faith to receive it and to handle it Lord let the glory glory glory glory glory be in your name Jesus help us here tonight that we'll leave out this place Lord desiring to be more serious and more consecrated and more surrendered to you help me Jesus you know whom I desire I need your Lord I need you I desire you Lord with all my heart I desire you I want every bit of darkness out of my life I want nothing to hinder you Lord God I want to be an example Lord in this generation and what the bride of Jesus Christ is to be and only you know Lord God how to move in my life to make it so but this night Lord I'll say it and I said in the eyes of witnesses whatever it takes to put me in that place Lord not for my glory Lord Jesus for your glory not to make me something father I've ran from prosperity Lord
