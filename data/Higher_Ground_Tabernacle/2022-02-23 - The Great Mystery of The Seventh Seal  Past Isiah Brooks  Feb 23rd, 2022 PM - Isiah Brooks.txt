TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and every attribute everything in that seed will grow and flourish and all the tree has to do is yield to the life that's within it so is the true believable but let me move on look at what it says in luke 2 21 to 38. speaking of the coming of the messiah and in that day almost all of israel visited they weren't looking for everybody was interested in their church their church activities being renowned and how well they could be accepted in their little cultures and so when jesus came they didn't know him even when he was first born all of jerusalem street of boulevard knew nothing about him the people in bethlehem who didn't which is called the house of god's bread they didn't even know him it was such a mystery it was such a strange thing that god would do and you know it was way beyond anything they thought but it happened and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that opened the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtle doves or young two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was a just and devout this is what he says waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him what are you saying this is why jesus constantly told them watch and pray if you're watching and praying what you're watching what you're looking for you're looking for the prophecies that have been been made or prophesied unto the church to come to pass you watch it and you're praying while you're watching it that you will be counted worthy amen these people out of all the religious people were there praying and watching for the messiah now how could that be because they received a revelation from god somewhere somewhere in their lives god told them this is the season this is the day this is the hour that's another thing people always think when jesus said no man knoweth the day or the hour people always think 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour no he's talking about a season no man knowing the day that day is a season no man knowing the hour that hour is a season but in that season you're supposed to watch and pray oh come on people amen we know let me stop and and say what i need to say we know that the mark of the beast is not putting 666 in your head or in your forehead or your hand or your forehead we know we didn't understand it but god's interpretation is a boycott and the prophet god said when they begin to boycott against the bride you understand when that union comes amen because what is it the antichrist is now building a system a union they're coming together and the whole point behind that is to shut the bride out that's where the mark is and when you fail to see that we're living in that day and and just like the brother i heard a brother say the other day watch russia all of this boycotting and union is coming together and now you see russia on this place what do you think coming then you see earthquake here volcano here volcano earthquake flood everything is setting up amen this whole system to do what to union themselves against the bride of christ amen you say it ain't happening it is happening rome and the church unified themselves against the christ that's exactly what's happening again people say well well what about russia russia has been ordained to do what she's got to do that's right don't you worry she knows what she's got to do too everybody think russia or we can beat russia russia could whoop us a long time ago but god has a season and a time to bring everything to pass look at that volcano that roughed it out there that shook the fault and shook that fault there in los angeles don't you know it has already been locked and loaded it's a wonder it didn't release then so how much time do we have and if we have a little time what must we be doing with that time listen it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death sound like a rapture message to me before he had seen the lord's christ he and anna was the only one that knew that when jesus would come he would be a baby they weren't looking you know they were out in the street looking for some great soldier you know dressed in some kind of wonderful armor no they knew he would come in a way that the people did not believe or wouldn't believe he would come amen now even god told him is that right herod even knew that jesus was coming i mean the wise men of the the of the roman of excuse me of that particular chapter told him that he would be born in bethlehem and herod said kill all the babies three years and under trying to kill the christ but he escaped went down to egypt veiling himself grew up come back he comes into the temple and he's teaching at the age of 12. confounding the pharisees with this wisdom and knowledge and they still didn't get it and it came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought him in the trial to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now let us thou servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou have prepared for the before the face of all people a light to the light lighten a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel now watch what he does he he literally put the gentiles before the jew israel and what was it this jesus was coming for a bride he was coming for his other party if you want to say it like this which was the gentile you said well what do you mean what do you mean let me say it like this and you heard me say this before even when it comes and i'm gonna tell y'all something people if y'all think you're gonna let me say it like this you'll never have faith believing the way we we most most of us believe that jesus is going to sneak up on you and in a moment of a twinkling i catch you unaware that is not what the bible says the bible says you're children of the light you're children of the day is that right he said that will not come upon you unawares you you'll be aware of what's happening why because of the opening of the seals because of the opening of the word because of the seven thunders however you want to say it but we know what's coming and we know where we're standing why because he came with the book open amen no more mysteries no more secrets for the bride the thing that she needs to come to understand is that the move is on for the bride and she must understand that she is the coming of the lord that's right amen he calling the bride coming when does the bride come she is the elisha oh come on somebody that's why this holy ghost with your mind this anointing we are talking about amen you must receive it because if you do not receive that you'll never see what i'm talking about how can brother branham said she'll be so much like him she'll pull him out of heaven huh well how are you going to be like her like him if you don't receive his spirit you must receive his nature as our brother said that's the point and this his nature doesn't come by your works it comes by him maturing up into you that's what paul said grow up into him amen amen listen we thought the devil was our greatest enemy and brother brown says not so your greatest enemy is you it's your flesh you must allow the holy ghost to conquer your will your flesh you can't blame it on the devil no more because the devil is defeated now you must be defeated amen and joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken by him and simeon blessed them and sent unto married his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was anna a prophetess the daughter of penuel of the tribe of acer she was of a great age and had lived with the husband seven years from her virginity do you really think that's left there for nothing do you think it's worth it there for any seven years seven church ages seven virgins amen there waiting what for the coming of the lord and he came in a way that the world they'll never believe it first of all they'll never believe it because brother branham said it and when he saw the cloud up there he said that's my lord amen see why would he say that if it wasn't the coming of the lord if that wasn't him then who was he but then did it did it just stay a cloud no sir just like it was when moses saw him up on the mountain that same fire that was in the bush stepped into moses the same god that was in the cloud must step into you he must become your headship hallelujah she was a widow of about four school in four years which departed not from the temple you know we're not with us because our old husbands died if your old husband is still living you're an adulterer but that old man that old husband that you once lived with must die hallelujah before god marry you anyway she was a widow for about four score in 40 years which departed not from the temple and that is a generation you know what i'm saying but serve god with fasting and praying night and day she was sincere she was consecrated she wasn't about folly it wasn't crazy stuff going on in their lives they were so dedicated to that thought that he's coming and i must be ready when he comes so i can see him and everybody ain't gonna see him and i'm telling you i'm sorry the way the world has told you about the rapture taking place planes gonna crash and boats are gonna sink and all people gonna drop dead and people in this one bed left in the bed and one here that's not the way it's going it's a secret catching away there is a third coming of christ but that cro that coming is for the jews amen huh and when he comes they're going to do the same thing why because they're not that maybe they're thinking about jesus with pierced hands and you know scarred but when he comes he'll be in moses and elijah the same god that's where he'll be and then they're going to see where did you get those stars why what do you say oh people of god what moses and elijah is going to preach the same message that william branham preached that's right he's going to preach the same message that paul preached they gotta preach crucifixion you know that burial resurrection i'm not saying they won't see him they will see him but you got to understand everything will be by revelation because let me say it like this they were gardeners there were people even at the resurrection didn't see jesus only those who god opened their eyes to see everybody ain't going to see it wouldn't happen no see the thoughts of men has always getting us on uh in in the message unchangeable god god he doesn't change he always puts it out there for people and and we always mess up because we put our theology to it and we expect for it to be in a way that we can you know everybody can grasp it but that's not the way it happens brother adam said jesus we become a man he was a humble and how could a king of heaven have split spit in his face and rag around his head and hit him with a stick and said say they tell me you're a prophet tell us who hit you and we'll believe you you understand me how can he he literally allowed the people to do that and the whole time he was blinding them to the fact that that was the messiah even his disciples was blinded on the road to emma as they proved that they were and they said to jesus we thought that he was the one but prior to that they believed he was and then god had to open their eyes how by anointing the scripture and when were they eyes open when he sat in that tent and broke the bread the bible says then were their eyes open see what i'm saying the very word of god was preaching to them from moses all the way up and they still their eyes were holding they couldn't see that's what i'm talking about tell us who hit you and we'll believe you and he never opened his mouth how could that be the king that they were looking for was going to beat the world down but god sent them the king and because god sent it in his way then they refused to believe it but god had that way of doing to sin it and he never sent it any other way but what his word said he would come but they had their mind made up it had to be some other way that's where we make the mistakes friend that's where the trouble lays when the forerunner john the baptist came the voice of one crying in the wilderness why the bible said all the high places will be brought down and all the low places would be lifted up and all these things would take place the mountain would skip like rams and the leaves would clap their hands why they was expecting a shaking of this man coming down out of the corridors of heaven all dressed in fine linen and crown upon his head and something or something what happened god sent them an old preacher down on the well out down on the wilderness with a pierced a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him looked like a fuzzy worm his face all full of beer oh away with such a fella as that eating locust and and with honey and wild honey and and we don't want nothing like to do with that how could that forerun the messiah but it was god's way of forerunning the messiah now let me say it like this brother branham became to came to a place he was no threat see this is where the where the where the enemy comes in to attack you is when you become a threat you understand me they even sent uh the fbi and everything to investigate his meetings but when they found out he was not an intellectual and that he was just a country little fella that said you know his broken english and all of that then he was no longer a threat but they had no idea that when this man would die what would take place see what i'm saying john the baptist they got rid of him by cutting his head off and they thought they got rid of john the baptist and then come jesus and that's the way it's supposed to be when the elijah leave elijah's supposed to come amen the power of god is supposed to increase and not decrease that's right so what's happening we're being blinded by layer to see if many of people are still being blinded because they haven't died and rot to their own thinking god is trying to unfold this mystery to us and we're still looking like oh where's he where is he now we're he's here then if he's here then what does that mean he's here he's not floating around in the atmosphere he's supposed to be in in you and you and me in that day you'll know that i'm in the father of the fathers and me and i am in you that's where he's at and the very thing that people saw in elijah or brother branham they're supposed to be seeing it in us yes in a double way we've got to receive it in a way that god said it god is pleased with it that's his way he's all wisdom he's all-powerful he's omnipotent i'm the present oh he's god that i am not that i was or will be but i am forever the same he's god and he does things in mysterious ways but he does it for his own glory he does it because that is his best to do it that way we must receive it the way that he sends it i'm sure that all uh and that's the problem you know people say well the seals are not open they're not fully open and some say they fully open it and those who say they fully opened and they said well he hasn't come but he's coming oh my god and if he's coming what he's coming for and if brother branham wasn't didn't finish the mystery then we might as well look for another malachi 4. unless you believe he's returning to do something but you'll find out that that's not scriptural and if you can just find me a type where it happens in the word i can understand what you're saying but i can tell you and i can show you how the holy spirit is a progressive spirit and it moves from one person to another that's how god works oh but believe you me even in this day it's not going to be a great group of people because a lot of people are not willing to die to their teachings right oh i know i got it right paul thought he had it right too and he began to persecute the christians it took jesus christ to blind him and then reopen his eyes for him to see that the god that he worshipped under the law has now moved into a dispensation of grace and then god chose chosen paul to preach a message that was so contrary to the jewish tradition that it caused him to be persecuted and killed three times and you know beaten and everything else what made that man do what he did because his eyes were open and there was a birth there was a life the same christ that died on calvary was now living in paul amen so much so that paul said they even took me as jesus himself amen and if that be the truth that's the way it's supposed to be with us you say what it was that way with william branham people literally thought that's who he was and he had to tell the people no no no no i'm not the one i'm just a uh uh i'm not the son of man i'm a son of man revealing the son of man i'm pointing you to him i'm not him i wait i wait on him and as i see him move i move he never gave glory to himself it was never about him it was all about jesus christ amen hallelujah he said well what do you mean even elijah john the baptist amen the voice crying in the wilderness he was the only one that saw the sign the whole pharisees didn't hear him that see him he saw that dove is sitting down in heaven and landing on jesus and he was the one that said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in everybody didn't see it amen standing right there and they didn't see it like the revelation of the seven seals people can read that and quote it but it's not in that except the father reveals it to you you won't see it it takes the anointing of god for you to see this message why it's been hidden hidden it's hidden from the wise and the pluto why do you think god allowed him him to say at the opening of the seals 700 and he said it more than one time it's bad english during the whole time it was to run those wise men away those people who thought those intellectuals those those those uh pharisees of the day it was to shut them down it was supplying them and then brother balaam said there's not one error in there see they they couldn't understand that it wasn't given to them but there's a pride who can hear there's a bride that have eyes to see what ears to hear hallelujah is that all right listen the word of god called into luke 21 9 29-34 he says and he spake them a power but behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth to see and know of your own shells the summer is now nigh in hand now you could be out there looking for a fig tree but the bible says that israel is that tree where they now shoot forth to see and when they now shall fought you see and know of your own selves that the summer is not nigh at home they're looking for people now don't you understand people typically the whole thing they're the whole bible says that israel is when we look at our country and we they cut our oil off and then all of a sudden it goes to russia and china and we don't even see brother brown says watch russia and watch her when she goes for the oil you watch this flip and you're right in the midst of it and what are you looking for you understand you must understand this is the time this is the hour this is the season and therefore you need to make sure you have your garment on bearded i'm saying to you this generation shall not likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye not that the kingdom of god is nigh in here what kingdom of god the kingdom of god is not meat or drink but it's what power light i can go on where in the holy ghost and the [Music] [Music] he don't buy he doesn't sell man the earth none of those things that have no value to him the only thing that's valuable is you looking at all the gold and the diamonds and all that stuff he cares about you more than he cares about the sparrows and what you're wearing and what you look like that's what's wrong with praying and asking god to reveal truth to you you need revelation to understand listen without what is revelation but light that's your lantern that's your way of knowing which direction to move heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass i'm not saying don't do what you're doing but my thing is direction to move into folly take heed he says in the third and fourth verse not saying don't do what you're to your what self don't get caught unless at any time your heart be overcharged with society and drunkenness and cares of this life and oh i gotta have this and i gotta have that oh i gotta be rich and i gotta be this and i gotta have all and you're forgetting that the world is getting ready to burn i have this and i gotta have nothing you can achieve in this life is going to stand the thing that's most important it should be is your soul oh the thing that's most important it should and that's what's happening you see everybody in this message even in this church everybody's so busy working and getting this card in overcharged and now the devil's got you tangled up and you got to have this and you got to have over time you got to do it and you don't even know your mind is on those things when your mind should be on christ how are you going to have your mind on christ when you've allowed satan to wear you into some stuff how are you going to have your mind on christ when you've got mercy the coming of the lord help mercy this is approximately 500 million so-called christians listen there is what he's speaking of one in a million he said there's approximately one 500 million this is a long time ago so-called christians in the world today and each day is a generation and now what if the rapture would come today and 500 people university will be taken in the rapture university you would never know or even in the paper of them going in the paper of them the coming of the lord is a secret comic it's a secret comment he'll come and steal away it'll be such a minority just like it was in the days when the disciples have jesus jesus why does the scribes say that elias must first come and he said he has already come and you never knew they didn't even know john the baptist the anointing of the liars was on him i'm almost done coming from the messenger god's chosen place of worship he said then father we pray that you'll visit us tonight in the world we'll come here for correction for understanding that we might know just how to live in the present day and what to look forward to forward to what to do but we know that the coming of the lord is drawing nine according to all the signs that the prophet foretold we're nearing the time lord when when complete uh differences will be given to your children god let us everyone be and we're trying to prepare for that hour now he's not talking about a 24-day uh 60-minute hour when rebecca saw the men coming let me tell you like this and you heard me preach this before jesus says lord and let her also water the canvas now rebecca didn't hear that she wasn't dead but being that she was bright chosen of god god granted her the revelation and if you know the message brother said god works on both ends and as god was working with elohees and abraham god was also working with rebecca it was an unwritten word it was unspoken word and she caught the revelation and so when she gave the water to the men she also watered the camel y'all understand me that was that part of the message brother i couldn't figure it out but it has to be manifested through somebody it can't god doesn't speak things and leave them out there as some mystic it's a revelation it is something that god amen is doing but it's such a mystery it is given only to the right to know what to do with the word it is the pride coming of christ i'm telling you these things and you know what without the revelation without god quickening it to you you don't even know what i'm talking about as christ was the first one and i'm talking it ain't nothing it's really simple it was always simple we make it complicated the only thing that we failed to do is that you can't even you got to get the holy ghost and like we know we say okay we what is the holy ghost it comes to change when you die and you rot into your own ideas and you surrender to god god comes in you might shout you might dance you might cry want to be more like him more like him there's something that drives you listen you can be illiterate you don't have to be a theologian because the revelation will come to you because he's in you as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all those tight all although all those types in many places he was the first fruit of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there have to be a sheep waved again in the last days and he did waving or of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to maturity the first one that proved he was a sheath that proved it was a sheath what's the use of saying oh brother burnham did this brother branham did that brother did this and you don't understand why he did it what was saying what god was doing god brought him to a maturity in this day it could not have happened until the capstone came down the fullness of the word you think the you know the capstone over there you think that was just what would you think that was for it what brother said it wasn't for the world then who was it for amen it was for the bride to recognize that this word that was given to our dear or her was to prep prepare her to meet him it's the only entrance into heaven it really is i'm not saying that there's a not come a foolish but i'm just saying to be bride to make a rapture there was a word given to her to address and adorn herself and understand this is not a natural adorning this is spiritual and the problem is is that your veil just like his veil and just like christ's veil veils jesus christ from the world they may look at you stupid and remain like you dumb and you're not so smart but in you you got jesus christ and all of us may not be raised in the dead and all of us may not be speaking things into existence but whatever the purpose is for us it's happening hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age because there ain't no thing in the bright age it is that itself is a mystery for a resurrection out of dark denomination did you come out of dark denominations will be a message that the full maturity of the world has returned back again in its what full power being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there that's what the prophet of god was there for to wave and to let you see that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah when they saw him they saw he was a kentuckian but oh my when the blind eyes were being opened that wasn't a man amen amen when the dead was being raised that was not a man amen when he spoke through this to the storms that was not a man that was god tabernacling in what what is the greatest mystery that god the almighty god the holy god the righteous god the the the omnipotent god can literally live in an ungodly flesh that's the mystery that god would live in fallen man nothing you could do nothing you could say you couldn't manipulate him you can't pay him he chose you he elected you he performs in you for his own good pleasure and his own will because i live you live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that that was let me tell you something and the resurrection is to bring back that which is going down bring it back up and if we don't see a resurrected christ in our midst there is no resurrection you understand what i'm saying resurrection means that the christ that once lived is now living in you that means when people see you they see christ listen i'm telling you people we have educated this thing so much we have talked it out so much we have done everything we can a thought that we could but there is something lacking and until this anointing that i'm talking about revisits us we are in dangerous place we are in a dangerous place i'ma say it again until that anointing and when i said i'm not talking about all the shouting and dancing i'm talking about the divine love that can love his enemy love their friends and love conquers everything love don't quit love doesn't give up love don't give up on brothers love don't doesn't give up on friends love conquers love understands the warfare because love is god amen and i'm gonna tell you something until we see that we're standing in a dangerous place and i'm gonna tell you like this in closing it's not about power it's not by might but it's by his spirit amen amen and what we need to see is more god you see that's why people don't come to church they've been blinded people who could be here they don't come for various reasons now some people are legit they've got good reasons but people don't understand the time we're living in they don't understand that they overtaken the things they got too many things in their lives and that's what happened to them that wise version she had all the natural oils she wasn't looking for one she had it and that's what happened to the foolish virgins they would help us lord you pray for me and obviously i don't know what they thought they just thought they had more time and maybe they thought they were too good to be left behind i don't know how that's got to be more than so got to be a powerful life it's got to be listen he said well two or three gathered in my name don't you understand that i mean not because you believe in the name of jesus christ it means that you got his name you you got his character but two or three are gathered in my name you got his character you got his life in you that's what he's talking about not because you've got higher grounds jesus christ some other kind of talent that's not what he's talking about [Music] we've got remember the message i've talked to you about about elevating our minds we're so afraid of things that we've never written what let me say like this of the things you have heard already [Music] it must be a change this whole coming to the church coming here is about change lord change me bring me a word that's going to change me from glory to glory here is lord change lord change me but you give me a word that's going to change me from glory to glory lord with flesh but you've got to have a vision of what you're being changed into the word has already become flesh to jesus christ the word now the flesh must become the word everything was dying must come to a place of jesus it's just like every time it seemed like it gets harder you must come to a place have faith in jobs [Music] it seems like it's getting it ain't in you you can't do it don't make it happen and i'm not trying to cut down everything [Music] and you know that these things are [Music] [Music] to do is think about jesus lord give me and understand you know because for some reason you know because they knew the day and they knew the hour they knew the season right they're waiting right there [Music] let us bow our thank you for the word that has been spoken paul said it was a great ministry and now we're living in the day up to us oh god to find out search it out to know what it's about what is going on what changes it's got to be more than just listening to a or read the word because you're the only one that can quicken it you're the only one that can reveal it to us because we need revelation as your prophet said we'll one day understand how important revelation was [Music] as elijah saw elijah go away and then that same holy spirit comes right back down and drops it's no longer the elijah it's the eliza it's the bride coming [Music] uh you know to bring us to that place of transfiguration to bring us to that change oh god where you and i uh we become lord help us we can we will [Music] those changes [Music] right now the pressure is great and everybody all kinds of pressures striking everybody just disturbing homes [Music] everything is moving satan is moving [Music] hallelujah gloria let us stay under that anointing anointing lord your anointing keep our eyes anointed to see it understand right [Music] all the way to you 99 and a half you lead us in guidance [Music] please
