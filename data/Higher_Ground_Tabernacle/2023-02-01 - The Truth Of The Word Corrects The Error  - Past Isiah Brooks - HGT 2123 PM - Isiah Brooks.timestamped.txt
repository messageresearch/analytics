[0:01] oh come on somebody that's what he's
[0:04] trying to tell us
[0:05] he's now gone away
[0:10] Hallelujah but that's the time you must
[0:13] wake him
[0:20] you want to see a Revival you must call
[0:24] Jesus on the scene to see a Revival in
[0:27] your life the preacher can't do it for
[0:30] you
[0:31] you are an individual you must do it
[0:34] yourself
[0:38] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[0:41] and because of the veil Israel is still
[0:43] blind
[0:45] the lutherans had Luther the Methodist
[0:48] had Wesley the Pentecostals they had
[0:52] Bishops and elders and whatever more and
[0:55] they're blind
[0:57] why because
[0:59] all of them followed the traditions of
[1:02] the elders
[1:04] is that right I mean that's what that's
[1:07] what the Jews did in Jesus day well why
[1:10] don't your disciples wash their hands I
[1:12] mean you know they had laws that the
[1:14] elders did and they wanted Jesus to
[1:16] follow that stuff Jesus was the word
[1:19] we're not tradition we're not time
[1:24] Hallelujah we are eternal
[1:27] there is no time with us
[1:30] and you must understand that the message
[1:32] come Amen to make us see we are Eternal
[1:36] beings and one day we'll step into that
[1:39] eternity
[1:40] see but as long as you uh Captain by
[1:43] time time will make you old
[1:47] time will make you unhealthy time will
[1:52] rotten you destroy you but if you are
[1:55] eternal
[1:56] somebody help me here
[1:59] eternity is the only thing that can stop
[2:01] time is that right because when the
[2:04] mighty angel came down and the seals
[2:07] were open the word was to come time
[2:10] shall be normal
[2:12] somehow the revelation of that must
[2:14] strike the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:17] Hallelujah
[2:19] there's a veil that we need to break
[2:21] through
[2:22] amen that eternal
[2:25] you know we you know uh Paul said we're
[2:28] settlingly in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:30] Jesus there is a place that God wants us
[2:34] to move into but you'll never get there
[2:36] being carnal
[2:38] and you'll never get there depending on
[2:41] someone else to take you there
[2:44] huh there are people
[2:47] there are people in this message who are
[2:49] waiting on brother Branham to take them
[2:51] there
[2:53] that was my message I didn't finish last
[2:55] week or whatever two weeks ago
[2:57] president said I've taken you as far as
[2:59] I can take you
[3:00] but you see those bloody Footprints he
[3:03] said follow those bloody footprints
[3:07] see and the Bloody Prince come from
[3:09] Jesus Christ himself people afraid
[3:13] because tradition is being broken
[3:16] Veil is man being smashed
[3:19] Hallelujah don't be afraid
[3:22] this is what happens Amen to a real in a
[3:25] real birth a chicken KC Beyond the Veil
[3:28] but when he breaks through it
[3:31] Hallelujah he breaks through through
[3:34] light and life in a in another dimension
[3:38] he didn't even know existed
[3:40] and that's what we are we're in the womb
[3:43] of the Earth but we must break through
[3:45] these elements break through this
[3:48] carnality break through everything
[3:50] that's that time holds us prison to
[3:54] we've got to
[3:56] come through to this great
[3:58] great atmosphere this Kingdom that Jesus
[4:02] spoke of
[4:03] it's beyond this little message thing
[4:06] what we've been doing going around in
[4:08] circles just like Israel it's beyond
[4:11] that I'm not trying to criticize anybody
[4:14] I'm just trying to tell you I'm anointed
[4:17] by God Amen to break through the Veil
[4:21] Hallelujah to break through tradition to
[4:24] break through everything that has been
[4:26] holding this bride back is later than
[4:29] what we think
[4:32] Hallelujah I believe the men of God that
[4:35] have come before me has done an
[4:36] excellent job
[4:41] to do whatever they was ordained to do
[4:43] I'm not criticizing anybody
[4:46] but I must do I be I must do what I'm
[4:48] ordained to do
[4:49] amen
[4:51] amen this message is so great the word
[4:54] corrects all error as I said it corrects
[4:58] science it corrects Society is that
[5:01] right when Herod uh uh uh uh I think it
[5:05] was Herod that one took his his wife's
[5:08] brother's wife
[5:09] John the Baptist clearly ah that ain't
[5:11] yours
[5:14] see that's the that's the word that
[5:17] wasn't John that was word in John
[5:20] hallelujah thank God for the grace of
[5:23] God
[5:24] none of us would be worthy right now you
[5:27] see what I'm saying most of us was worse
[5:29] than Herod
[5:31] oh amen but the grace of God has found
[5:34] us amen we were probably more like like
[5:37] the woman at the well or Mary Magdalene
[5:39] or somebody you know but nevertheless
[5:41] they Pride you hear what I'm saying it
[5:45] didn't matter what they did under sin it
[5:47] was when the grace of God found them
[5:49] like I said
[5:52] he will make you free the truth we did
[5:55] what we did because we didn't know who
[5:58] we were
[5:59] but now that we know that we've been
[6:01] born to be Sons and Daughters of God it
[6:04] has awakened us to who we really are
[6:07] it's sometimes hard to believe that I
[6:10] can be a Son of God a true Son of God
[6:14] a son of Hell or him if you want to say
[6:17] it the God who created all things you
[6:20] and I are Sons and Daughters of the
[6:21] Creator it's just can't I get cave
[6:24] fathoming so they're in the beginning
[6:26] with God all things were made by him
[6:29] and without him was not anything made
[6:32] that was made now that in itself
[6:34] tells you who the ruler is
[6:37] if you make something it makes you
[6:40] greater than the thing that you've made
[6:42] right it didn't make itself there's
[6:45] nothing that you see
[6:47] with your natural eyes
[6:49] that made itself
[6:53] it really it really sickens me when I
[6:57] hear people talking about evolution
[7:00] some tadpole or something dropped his
[7:03] legs and became whatever
[7:06] started from Iraq I think it was you
[7:08] mean to tell me my great great great
[7:09] great great great great
[7:11] grandfather is a rock
[7:16] people ought to wake up and
