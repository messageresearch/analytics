[33:13] yes Shana got behind
[33:16] oh let's sing it once again now we gonna
[33:44] sing that song one more time but I
[33:46] really want you to believe it you sing
[33:49] it like you don't believe it you sing it
[33:53] like oh when I wrote this morning I
[34:47] didn't have moved out Oh
[34:52] oh oh oh oh Jesus today the Holy Ghost
[36:11] yes it is
[36:12] oh the Holy Ghost yes hi oh the holy go
[36:27] give him another crap offering
[37:18] hallelujah you know the devil don't get
[37:22] cast out with lukewarmness you got to
[37:26] put some fire to it hmm let him know you
[37:31] mean what you say hallelujah he said I
[37:36] don't have that right now but Abraham
[37:38] seek all those things that be not as
[37:40] though they were hallelujah
[37:44] I believe when God sent Israel out to
[37:48] battle amen
[37:54] and they put all the musical instruments
[37:57] in front I don't believe they were
[38:00] singing near my god too deep amen
[38:06] exactly
[38:07] these were victory songs and when we
[38:11] come to church we must come with victory
[38:16] on our minds I don't always feel like it
[38:21] but when I get here I know I have I'm
[38:26] coming before the king and I realized
[38:30] tonight or this morning that he's worthy
[38:34] of my praise there's a lot of things I
[38:38] want to say to the church this morning
[38:39] but I think I'll say them perhaps after
[38:43] service we are living in the last days
[38:46] and however you
[38:50] treat God because he sees these things
[38:55] he sees our reasoning he sees why we do
[39:00] what we do there's no hiding place
[39:05] outside of him I find out that in the
[39:12] last days that we people are growing
[39:15] cold and they don't even see it they
[39:19] don't see the love of God drifting away
[39:22] from their hearts they approach God like
[39:26] religion instead of a savior as I said I
[39:34] said there are many people who are know
[39:38] him as a savior but they don't know him
[39:41] as a friend the Bible said God called
[39:46] Abraham his friend when a friend sticks
[39:51] closer than a brother we are in a time
[39:55] that you've got to battle you've got to
[39:59] fight one of the things that Satan is
[40:03] doing to this little fellowship it's
[40:06] basically causing discolor ship there
[40:10] aren't many of you who really fellowship
[40:12] with one another and it's a selfish
[40:15] thing because everybody needs somebody
[40:18] and when people will try to make
[40:21] connections with you and try to get with
[40:24] you you ought to try your best to get
[40:25] with them
[40:27] because people don't ask for company if
[40:29] they don't need it we think about I put
[40:36] it this way Jesus going to always keep
[40:41] this appointment no matter how late we
[40:46] are we have a tendency to my family and
[40:51] others come in the house of God late and
[40:56] expect the spirit
[40:57] god to move maybe we don't have the
[41:02] number one song leader or song leaders
[41:06] maybe we don't have the great
[41:08] instruments players but I believe with
[41:15] all my heart the Lord never said that we
[41:18] had to use instruments but he did say we
[41:20] had to use our voices and the Bible said
[41:24] make a joyful noise unto the Lord you
[41:28] didn't say you had the same beautifully
[41:31] see that's the way the world got it it's
[41:33] so beautiful that it's just almost
[41:36] enticing sometimes when you hear people
[41:38] sing but that's not what God get glory
[41:42] God gets glory if a man don't even know
[41:45] how to make a tune in a in a can or a
[41:49] bucket but it's what's coming from the
[41:52] heart it touches him and I feel like if
[41:56] we're going to be a part of this church
[41:58] we need to be a part of the church in
[42:00] every way some of y'all know why I'm not
[42:03] here like I said before when I'm not
[42:05] here it's not like I'm on a picnic or a
[42:07] vacation I'm always doing the work for
[42:09] the Lord
[42:10] anyhow as we stand I have a few things I
[42:16] need to say afterwards
[42:18] something I need to say but don't want
[42:20] to say but I will say it don't worry I'm
[42:24] not quitting but its issues I believe
[42:30] with all my heart that God has brought
[42:33] this church together for work but Satan
[42:36] knows it too and he's doing everything
[42:38] he can to stop it and you and I must be
[42:45] aware that not one of us are exempt from
[42:48] the attacks of Satan you and I must know
[42:53] that God has a plan for us and it's not
[42:59] just to be a church member in a
[43:05] assembly as this but is to be a part of
[43:09] the body of Christ
[43:12] anyway less turn as we stand to Luke
[43:15] seven twelve through
[43:32] Luke 7 will begin reading at the 12th
[43:35] verse now when he came nigh to the gate
[43:39] of the city behold there was a dead man
[43:43] carried out the only son of his mother
[43:47] and she was a widow and much people of
[43:54] the city was with her and when the Lord
[43:57] saw her he had compassion on her and
[44:00] said unto her weep not and he came and
[44:06] touched the buyer and they that bare him
[44:11] stood still and he said young man I say
[44:16] unto thee arise and he that was dead
[44:21] set up and began to speak and he
[44:25] delivered him to his mother there came
[44:30] of fear on all and they glorified God
[44:34] saying that a great prophet is risen up
[44:38] among us
[44:39] and that God had visited his people in
[44:45] this room of him went forth throughout
[44:48] all Judea and throughout all the region
[44:53] round about father let's pray we thank
[44:59] you Lord for your grace a diversity Lord
[45:02] we are in a situation here that we need
[45:07] your help in your guidance Lord a
[45:12] preacher can only do what he can do but
[45:16] father God you goes beyond the preacher
[45:20] you're the only one that can regulate
[45:22] the heart you're the only one that can
[45:26] transform you're the only one that could
[45:30] change us into what we ought to be
[45:35] father we realize that the enemy in this
[45:38] age is rampant the death angel is moving
[45:43] in such a fast
[45:45] because he realized that his time is
[45:49] almost over in this particular age I
[45:53] pray father God that you will help the
[45:57] people of God to realize their spiritual
[46:00] condition those of us who need an
[46:04] awakening those of us who need revival
[46:10] Lord we count upon you there's no other
[46:15] one we could turn to but you
[46:18] and Father you said if my people they
[46:22] which are called by my name will humble
[46:24] themselves and pray and seek thy face
[46:29] you would turn from your weak and turn
[46:33] from our wicked ways you said Lord that
[46:36] you will come and heal the land father
[46:41] we need the land he'll help us here now
[46:46] in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[46:50] you may be seated
[46:51] I trust by God's grace that the message
[46:58] in which I'll bring this morning would
[47:00] be a blessing to you personally I
[47:04] believe that when God sent a prophet to
[47:09] bring us a message the this message was
[47:11] the message of the resurrection
[47:15] but the Branham did the last sign of the
[47:18] resurrection when he even turned his
[47:19] back to the audience and began to call
[47:22] out people by name and their condition
[47:26] now when he did that you know of course
[47:29] the Bible tells us that will not get a
[47:32] greater sign in this generation outside
[47:35] of the sign of the Resurrection and this
[47:40] resurrection was to bring a revival when
[47:45] hiya when people saw the move of God in
[47:51] the days of William Branham it was
[47:55] supposed to be
[47:58] raised the dead not just naturally
[48:02] because he did that too but it was
[48:06] supposed to take those who were
[48:08] spiritually dead and bring them back to
[48:12] life you see my Jesus never preached the
[48:17] funeral service and in this message that
[48:21] should never be preached a funeral
[48:27] service we ought to be preaching to the
[48:31] living we find out when this miraculous
[48:37] thing took place it didn't just stay
[48:41] local but it started a fire and this
[48:48] fire Amen was rumored throughout all
[48:50] Judea and all the region round about
[48:56] there's a man in the city and he's not
[49:00] only healing but he's also raising the
[49:05] dead it is so amazing because even in
[49:10] this time John who was the one who
[49:12] introduced the Messiah and said some of
[49:16] his disciples to Jesus and they inquired
[49:20] of him and they said unto him we've been
[49:26] sent by John and John wants to know are
[49:31] you the one see you got to realize there
[49:35] are people in this message now that are
[49:36] literally turning because they're asking
[49:39] are you the one or should we look for
[49:43] another but the identification of the
[49:48] Resurrection had already been given
[49:55] Jesus didn't say let him know I'm the
[49:58] one but he said amen when the men will
[50:04] come unto Him when he said now I want to
[50:07] tell you something you're going to see
[50:11] something just watch the
[50:12] ministry it's not a man that's doing
[50:16] this thing but watch the Ministry of
[50:19] this man and jesus answered and said
[50:25] unto them go your way and tell John what
[50:29] things you have seen in her how did the
[50:34] blind see the lame walk the lepers are
[50:39] cleansed the Deaf hear the dead are
[50:42] raised to the poor the gospel is
[50:45] preached understand what I'm saying here
[50:48] if Jesus is on the scene even in this
[50:53] fellowship hallelujah
[50:55] what's supposed to be happening hmm
[51:01] what's supposed to be happening the
[51:03] blind is supposed to be seeing the lame
[51:06] is supposed to walk the lepers are to be
[51:09] cleansed the deaf ears are to be opened
[51:11] hallelujah and the gospel is to be
[51:14] preached hallelujah because Hebrews 13
[51:18] and 8 says that Jesus Christ is the same
[51:21] yesterday today and forever
[51:23] he's a God that changes not and this
[51:27] bride Amen is supposed to be Amen the
[51:31] reflection of the resurrection
[51:33] resurrection supposed to be in US around
[51:37] us hallelujah is that right Matthew 28
[51:47] he is the resurrection the Bible tells
[51:51] us and we know all of the stories and
[51:54] things we've heard of Jesus and I don't
[51:58] know where your Jesus is alive and not
[52:00] been mine is I don't know whether you've
[52:04] experienced the resurrection but I have
[52:05] and in the end of the Sabbath as it
[52:11] began to dawn toward the first day of
[52:13] the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[52:16] other Mary to see the sepulchre I
[52:19] experienced something and I don't want
[52:22] to say it's a
[52:25] in that I had to counsel and let me tell
[52:31] you something I saw message believers
[52:36] act works worst then unregenerate at
[52:41] sinners hey it grieved me because there
[52:51] was no love there was no godly virtue
[52:55] there at all it scared me to think that
[53:01] people who have been in this message for
[53:04] so many years can behave in such a way
[53:09] that it made me so it literally scared
[53:18] me and I said to myself then who in this
[53:21] message really have the true Holy Ghost
[53:25] because I tried to correct them with the
[53:28] word and I was ignored and I'm still
[53:32] frustrated about it I was ignored
[53:36] I could disrespect it you name it I can
[53:41] go down the list as if I wasn't even
[53:44] there and yet these are believers it
[53:51] grieves me because let me tell you
[53:54] something saints of God it doesn't
[53:56] matter how much you know about what
[53:58] brother Branham said if you don't have
[54:01] what he said you must have your worship
[54:05] is in vain and sometimes
[54:13] Minoo I think about this thing I said
[54:16] because you gotta understand brother
[54:18] branham said now you've got to get the
[54:20] token you got to get the holy ghost
[54:23] hallelujah
[54:24] these virtues that we talked about the
[54:27] statue of a perfect man and that's what
[54:28] I said I said I said then you know I
[54:30] said I've never said this atmosphere I
[54:33] said I believe brother Browns message I
[54:35] believe that we ought to be exemplifying
[54:38] the statue of Christ right now hush for
[54:43] a moment in English that God be merciful
[54:46] that people have no discernment of the
[54:49] Holy Ghost and just like I told them the
[54:51] Holy Ghost is not here don't you know I
[54:54] can feel it when I come here I know when
[54:56] the Holy Ghost is not present I know
[54:58] there's sin somewhere in the camp and
[55:01] God is going to get you if you don't
[55:06] repent God will slow walk you and behold
[55:11] there was a great seat there should be
[55:12] more here but they're not and behold
[55:16] there was a great earthquake for the
[55:19] angel of the Lord descendant of heaven
[55:21] and came and rolled back the stone from
[55:24] the door and it sat upon it and his
[55:27] confident was like lightning and his
[55:29] raiment white as snow for fear of him
[55:34] that keepeth did shake and became as
[55:38] dead men and the angel said unto the
[55:41] woman fear not
[55:42] he for I know that you seek Jesus which
[55:45] was crucified he is not here for He is
[55:49] risen
[55:49] ha I like that statement he is not here
[55:54] and that's the problem
[55:55] amen we we're not this is not to be a
[55:58] tomb we're meant to sit up here like
[56:02] dead bodies hallelujah but when the
[56:06] resurrection is in a person Amen it is
[56:08] the true life of car God didn't come to
[56:15] start another religion the probably God
[56:19] they wanted him to be a part of what
[56:22] they call the latter rain movement he
[56:25] said it wasn't up god and he said it
[56:27] would fall and it did ha because God is
[56:31] looking for individuals that's gonna
[56:34] literally give their lives to him and be
[56:37] walking resurrection talking
[56:40] resurrection living resurrections come
[56:46] see waylaid that's what the prophet came
[56:50] to do to revive the Christian to let
[56:54] them know after 2,000 years he's still
[56:57] the same he's still living hallelujah
[57:00] and we serve a God that's risen
[57:02] hallelujah amen we talk about the coming
[57:10] of the Lord and somehow we allowed
[57:13] ourselves become lazy we we seemed you
[57:19] know I'm in the message and you know I
[57:21] dress or I look like the message so I'm
[57:23] in the message that don't know that has
[57:27] nothing to do with it it's not touch not
[57:30] taste not hand or not hallelujah is
[57:33] what's in your heart
[57:36] hallelujah come on somebody just like I
[57:40] told my wife today I said I have a
[57:41] belief that there are those of us who
[57:43] purpose to come late to church why now
[57:53] those of us who know you can't come on
[57:55] time I understand that and maybe some
[57:58] time you need to talk to me about it so
[58:00] I can understand that but nevertheless
[58:02] we realize they meant that those things
[58:04] greed a mouth where am i off the word it
[58:10] grieves the Holy Spirit don't we care
[58:12] we're not battling against one another
[58:15] we're grieving the Holy Spirit when we
[58:17] don't do it right now I I'm gonna let
[58:23] God preach but the Bible said I would
[58:28] not you be ignorant brethren concerning
[58:30] them which are asleep
[58:33] she saw not even as others which have no
[58:35] hope but if we believe that Jesus died
[58:39] and rose again even so them also which
[58:42] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[58:45] you said brother but you shouldn't say
[58:47] those things but let me tell you
[58:48] something when we go to our jobs we are
[58:50] on time
[58:51] because we know that if we don't go on
[58:53] time we're going to be fired this is a
[58:56] job this is an occupation you work for
[59:02] Christ you work for his kingdom for this
[59:09] we say unto you by the word of the Lord
[59:12] that ye which are alive and remain unto
[59:14] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[59:16] them which are asleep I'm coming to
[59:18] where I'm going for the Lord himself
[59:20] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[59:22] and with the voice of a stark angel and
[59:25] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[59:27] Christ shall rise first then we which
[59:30] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[59:33] together with them in the clouds to meet
[59:36] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[59:40] be with the Lord
[59:42] how great the same it will be if any of
[59:45] us miss the rapture what a shame and it
[59:49] won't be nobody's fault but your own
[59:52] hallelujah where can you find the Word
[59:56] of God being talked about when we have
[59:59] fellowship do we talk about Jesus do we
[1:00:03] talk about each other what somebody else
[1:00:07] is doing or what not they are you know
[1:00:10] but that ain't what the Bible says the
[1:00:13] Bible said comfort one another with
[1:00:16] these things that means we ought to
[1:00:18] constantly talk about the coming of the
[1:00:20] Lord let us see the condition of the
[1:00:23] world let us see the condition of the
[1:00:25] church him and y'all will understand he
[1:00:28] Zika said only those whose heart and cry
[1:00:31] after the abomination that is being done
[1:00:34] in the city will be sealed if you don't
[1:00:37] have a burden for lost souls our burden
[1:00:40] for this church other than criticism
[1:00:43] Amen you need prayer
[1:00:47] and we're we liking wouldn't it be
[1:00:49] wonderful if if we had more help around
[1:00:52] here John 11:17 you know we we must
[1:00:59] understand amen jesus is alive and well
[1:01:03] hallelujah
[1:01:05] I'm not crying out like this to be mean
[1:01:07] no sir I care for people I care for
[1:01:11] Souls I know at this hour where the
[1:01:15] pressure is placing on everybody and
[1:01:17] don't tell me you're not having a strain
[1:01:19] don't tell me you're not struggling
[1:01:22] everybody is struggling right now but in
[1:01:25] order for us to make it as a body we
[1:01:28] must pull together we must find things
[1:01:31] to do what's wrong with our phone call
[1:01:33] what's wrong with the visit hallelujah
[1:01:43] and we need to do better we say lord
[1:01:46] help us
[1:01:47] and then when God try to help you bring
[1:01:49] things to your mind you still don't do
[1:01:51] what he asked you to do help us Lord
[1:01:53] really oh hey what about Lazarus look at
[1:02:02] Lazarus and Lazarus also types out the
[1:02:05] church that was not only just a friend
[1:02:08] of Jesus that Lazarus stayed in the tomb
[1:02:12] for four days what's going to happen
[1:02:16] when Jesus you call on him and he don't
[1:02:18] answer he won't answer you because he's
[1:02:22] just keeping quiet to see what you're
[1:02:24] gonna do about it he could have called
[1:02:26] us in to messengers he Mary and Martha
[1:02:29] don't even worry about it I got it all
[1:02:31] under control but he did he was silent
[1:02:34] he said no message to Mary and Martha
[1:02:37] nothing
[1:02:38] and when God don't send a message to you
[1:02:41] in the time of your crisis what is your
[1:02:43] attitude hallelujah God a little
[1:02:47] situation die I come down to a place
[1:02:50] where it seems impossible because he
[1:02:53] wants you to know that with Christ all
[1:02:55] things are possible and he let Lazarus
[1:02:59] be there
[1:03:00] man for four days rotten and stinking
[1:03:03] according to history when they rolled
[1:03:05] back the stone they said the sticks feel
[1:03:08] the air and some people literally
[1:03:09] fainted but the truth of the matter is
[1:03:14] it doesn't matter
[1:03:15] amen how much the skin worms heat up
[1:03:18] your flesh like job says yet in my flesh
[1:03:22] shall see God you see I want you to
[1:03:26] understand this message is not supposed
[1:03:28] to be something in your head it's
[1:03:30] supposed to be in your heart
[1:03:31] and when it's in your heart
[1:03:34] you live it witness in your heart you
[1:03:37] sensitive to your brothers your scissors
[1:03:39] amen to one another and Bethany was
[1:03:53] lying to the Rouge about 15 furlongs off
[1:03:55] and many of the Jews came to Martha and
[1:03:58] Mary to comfort them concerning their
[1:04:00] brother but jesus never showed up he
[1:04:07] knew where they lived but he never
[1:04:10] showed up
[1:04:12] and you say I trust God with all my
[1:04:15] heart and as soon as things don't go
[1:04:17] your way you let unbelief overtake you
[1:04:21] help us Lord God is a God that would
[1:04:26] test you is that right the gospel has
[1:04:29] been time tested there is not a servant
[1:04:32] of the Lord in the Bible that has never
[1:04:34] been tested by God no one has been
[1:04:37] exempt he said what do you mean brother
[1:04:40] Brooks do you take Joseph who was
[1:04:42] supposed to be the perfect one God
[1:04:44] tested him if you were Joseph how would
[1:04:48] you have felt when you knew that all
[1:04:51] your brothers and sisters don't like you
[1:04:53] you may even feel like that in the
[1:04:55] church where's my friend where are my
[1:04:59] friends rather where are those who would
[1:05:01] come for me and I try to talk to him
[1:05:03] sometime and then you know what they do
[1:05:04] they push me aside like I'm dirty or
[1:05:07] high you know but maybe God has chosen
[1:05:11] you to be a Joseph
[1:05:14] maybe you really are spiritual and the
[1:05:16] devil don't like you to be spiritual so
[1:05:18] he's doing everything he can do to make
[1:05:20] you carnal
[1:05:21] so God would be God then what when
[1:05:24] Joseph thought things were going well
[1:05:25] with his brother the next thing they did
[1:05:27] was throw him in the ditch how would you
[1:05:33] have felt when you in your prayer life
[1:05:36] God had revealed to you that you was
[1:05:37] going to rule some day and now you're
[1:05:40] thinking oh my god I'm in a ditch and my
[1:05:41] brothers hate me
[1:05:44] some of y'all could say man y'all's
[1:05:46] mouths are so glued but the truth of the
[1:05:49] matter is true what you're gonna do are
[1:05:53] you gonna be a just a normal Christian
[1:05:54] are you gonna be somebody Amen that
[1:05:56] that's really loving the Lord
[1:05:58] what happened I've seen people change
[1:05:59] not for the good for the worst then okay
[1:06:04] oh it's so true I love God and you and I
[1:06:08] you know I said oh god what's happening
[1:06:10] what's happening what's happening
[1:06:11] everywhere I go I see women with how his
[1:06:14] shoes and women would makeup and women
[1:06:16] with this and that and the other and I
[1:06:18] think to myself my god what is happening
[1:06:20] to the people now I'm not talking about
[1:06:23] women that need it because they got a
[1:06:24] lot of blemish problems that's not I'm
[1:06:27] talking about people who don't need it
[1:06:28] and they still put it on you think
[1:06:38] see that and how you're gonna get the
[1:06:40] Holy Ghost wearing that it's true
[1:06:47] holiness and yet dresses are so tight
[1:06:50] you just wonder how they got in them
[1:06:53] when yours when your clothes are so
[1:06:55] tight that it's just form and everything
[1:06:57] God look at that it's being naked so yo
[1:07:00] you're dressing like that is in vain
[1:07:04] Martha amen is that Alright
[1:07:07] but I know you said oh brother Brookes
[1:07:09] daddy hurting yes good it's just a
[1:07:12] little weird
[1:07:13] just a little garment just a little
[1:07:15] thing amen hat it can kill just a little
[1:07:19] thing it is the little foxes that spoil
[1:07:22] the vine huh people God didn't send us a
[1:07:27] prophet that so we can make mockery of
[1:07:30] his word
[1:07:31] absolutely not sir I'm weak I just want
[1:07:37] you to understand you know you're not
[1:07:39] fighting for the Brutes I don't have a
[1:07:40] message other than what has been given
[1:07:42] to me remember I share with the brothers
[1:07:46] the other day
[1:07:47] Jeremiah 4 and 30 amen you go there and
[1:07:51] you see God don't like these things well
[1:07:56] brother but you make it along no if you
[1:07:59] truly got it you'll live it
[1:08:02] Martha said unto them I know that he
[1:08:05] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[1:08:07] the last day and Jesus said unto her I
[1:08:11] am the resurrection and the life and he
[1:08:14] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:08:15] yet shall he live
[1:08:19] hallelujah and whosoever liveth and
[1:08:22] believeth that means you gotta continue
[1:08:24] to believe in me shall never die he said
[1:08:29] believe it out this hallelujah Oh glory
[1:08:33] to God that man who was bad never knew
[1:08:35] him but when he woke up hallelujah and
[1:08:39] maybe you'd that way and then you like a
[1:08:41] dead corpse hallelujah being carried to
[1:08:44] the funeral to the graveside but all you
[1:08:46] need is one touch one touch from Jesus
[1:08:50] one touch that's all you need one word
[1:08:54] hallelujah we've got to keep focused and
[1:08:59] that's the point we've allowed Satan to
[1:09:03] to mess with our glasses and put us in a
[1:09:08] way that we we can't see God like we
[1:09:10] ought to but David was a wise man like I
[1:09:16] said the other day I said you know David
[1:09:18] was so close to God
[1:09:19] it meant that his songs became the word
[1:09:22] that his prayer became the word
[1:09:25] hallelujah search me O God y'all wanna
[1:09:34] revival search me O God and know my
[1:09:39] heart try me and know my thoughts and
[1:09:43] see if there be any wicked way in me and
[1:09:48] lead me in the way everlasting
[1:09:53] there's gotta be your everyday prat
[1:09:56] search me O God not once a week search
[1:10:01] me O God Lord maybe I did something
[1:10:04] maybe I said something maybe I was in a
[1:10:06] place I shouldn't have been but father
[1:10:08] show me go down into the heart show me
[1:10:14] my wicked ways because the Bible said in
[1:10:17] manner is always right in his own eyes
[1:10:20] and let me tell you something whenever
[1:10:23] you take your thoughts or what you
[1:10:27] assume to be right over the Word of God
[1:10:30] you are in trouble when you reason the
[1:10:34] word away that's why I love Hebrews 13
[1:10:38] and 8 he says he's the same yesterday
[1:10:39] today and forever that means what he
[1:10:42] didn't like yesterday he don't like it
[1:10:43] today and he ain't going to never like
[1:10:46] it focus that means to concentrate such
[1:10:51] a line on this thing hallelujah we need
[1:10:56] to learn Amen Lord you you're coming
[1:10:59] brother I said pray always he said every
[1:11:01] time you get a chance to pray
[1:11:03] pray Wow because we're living in such a
[1:11:06] dangerous hour hallelujah and you and I
[1:11:09] must realize him in that's where Satan
[1:11:11] is defeating us we don't pray like we
[1:11:14] hope to how are you going to keep focus
[1:11:18] without praying you forget that Jane
[1:11:21] says you look in the mirror and you
[1:11:23] forget you walk away you're looking at
[1:11:25] mirror I'm the bride I'm this I'm that
[1:11:27] and you walk away
[1:11:28] and you forget what kind of man you
[1:11:30] ought to be hallelujah
[1:11:31] there are things in men that happens in
[1:11:33] this message should never ever be spoken
[1:11:36] of it shouldn't be anybody in in a true
[1:11:44] message Church you know doing
[1:11:46] fornication and adultery and all those
[1:11:49] lust lasciviousness all those things
[1:11:51] shouldn't he be named among us yet we
[1:11:55] see that people doing it anyway and
[1:11:57] calling themselves believers and
[1:12:02] sometimes we're so fearful we'll see
[1:12:06] people doing wrong and won't even talk
[1:12:08] to him about it won't even bring a
[1:12:10] witness won't even bring it to the
[1:12:12] church and the whole time the church is
[1:12:14] dying because people have sin in their
[1:12:17] lives like a can and you wonder why your
[1:12:21] prayer life is not working let us hold
[1:12:25] fast the profession of our faith without
[1:12:28] wavering but he is faithful that
[1:12:33] promised let us consider one another to
[1:12:37] provoke unto love and to good works not
[1:12:41] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:12:44] together as the manner of some is but
[1:12:48] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:12:51] more as you see the Day approaching
[1:12:55] what's going to happen when the squeeze
[1:12:57] come on and and we can't even assemble
[1:13:00] our selves like this ain't got no piano
[1:13:03] ain't got no organ don't play the
[1:13:04] tambourine because they're gonna hear
[1:13:06] you and they're gonna find you hmm but
[1:13:10] you and I must understand that this
[1:13:12] thing has been love-motivated he was
[1:13:15] well I need the grace and the mercy
[1:13:17] God with the grace and the mercy of God
[1:13:19] is this message hallelujah God is trying
[1:13:23] to tell you what to do to be pardoned
[1:13:30] love for the better says move the mighty
[1:13:33] God not did it not hatred love God so
[1:13:38] loved the world the unlovable
[1:13:40] I was one of them till he come down and
[1:13:43] made himself flesh here on earth and
[1:13:46] dwelt among men to spit upon and miss
[1:13:50] people treated and be laughed at and
[1:13:54] made fun of and to redeem us back but if

[1:14:48] and you can feel finally fix your ears
[1:14:51] in such a way till you be sealed by the
[1:14:54] Antichrist see you can you can allow
[1:14:58] yourself to be stubborn you can come to

[1:15:04] sealing hopefully it's not any of us in

[1:15:40] camp oh god help us Lord you think and I

[1:16:09] Holy Spirit Antichrist is against the
[1:16:14] real Christ the real move of the Spirit
[1:16:17] and the things so close it's deceiving

[1:19:36] Christ did when he was here on the earth
[1:19:38] God let them stay until the Spirit of
[1:19:41] Christ comes in and ministers and
[1:19:43] ministers and all til there's a breaking
[1:19:46] of time going down to the Father's heart
[1:19:49] wheel and in a breaking being broken up
[1:19:52] and molded over until there be one great
[1:19:54] big roll rolling love of God
[1:19:57] sweeping across the nation to an
[1:20:01] old-fashioned revival calling back to
[1:20:04] the children back to God again granite
[1:20:07] Lord see what we you know the problem
[1:20:09] God he's crying out these things because
[1:20:11] he was able to see he wasn't preaching
[1:20:14] to the world he was preaching amen to
[1:20:17] the Christians that's what he was doing
[1:20:21] he was preaching to the Christians I
[1:20:29] trust that's what I'm doing this morning
[1:20:35] baba says according to Hebrews 10 but
[1:20:39] call to remembers the former days in
[1:20:41] which after you were illuminated you and
[1:20:43] do the great fight of affliction many of
[1:20:47] us we went through things when we first
[1:20:49] got saved you know we were so in love
[1:20:51] with God
[1:20:52] you know the criticism of the world it
[1:20:55] just would bounce off of us what we
[1:20:58] could care less of what people said and
[1:20:59] you know we were just so in love with
[1:21:01] him we we were praying praying without
[1:21:03] even asked to pray you know we just
[1:21:06] wanted to talk to him you know while we
[1:21:09] were yet made a gauged stock both by
[1:21:11] reproaches and afflictions and partly
[1:21:14] while you become companions of them that
[1:21:16] were so used but he had compassion of me
[1:21:19] and my bonds right and took joyfully the
[1:21:22] spoiling of your goods knowing in
[1:21:24] yourself that you have in heaven a
[1:21:26] better and then enduring substance Paul
[1:21:28] said not listen he said even you gave me
[1:21:30] some of your Goods even some you gave me
[1:21:32] you helped me why he didn't have much
[1:21:34] yourself but you knew Amen that you had
[1:21:37] a better place in heaven he cast not
[1:21:39] away therefore your confidence which was
[1:21:41] great which had great recompense of
[1:21:44] reward but you have need of patience
[1:21:46] that after you have done the will of God
[1:21:48] he might receive the promise see for yet
[1:21:51] a little while and he that shall come
[1:21:53] will come and we're not tearing now the
[1:21:56] just shall live by faith but if any man
[1:21:59] draw back my soul shall have no pleasure
[1:22:02] in him but we are not a bill who draw
[1:22:06] back unto perdition hallelujah
[1:22:09] we are not a being
[1:22:11] draw back unto perdition but of them
[1:22:14] that believe to the saving of the soul
[1:22:17] hallelujah
[1:22:18] Paul said listen brethren I count not
[1:22:21] myself to have apprehended but this one
[1:22:23] thing I do forgetting those things which
[1:22:25] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:22:28] things which are before I press toward
[1:22:31] the mouth no it's not easy it has never
[1:22:37] will be easy jesus said have you gonna
[1:22:39] follow me take up your cross and follow
[1:22:41] me
[1:22:42] it is a rocket way it is a hard way but
[1:22:46] it's a great way I press toward the mark
[1:22:50] for the prize of the high calling of God
[1:22:52] in Christ I don't want nobody doesn't
[1:22:54] know me as nothing but a Christian y'all
[1:22:57] hear me make me over again Lord but til
[1:23:05] the Lord the other day I said God I said
[1:23:07] I feel like a failure
[1:23:12] it just seems like everywhere you go or
[1:23:14] just things are not turning out right
[1:23:22] you think you over one storm and here
[1:23:24] comes another you think certain people
[1:23:28] have been delivered and then they drop
[1:23:30] back on you god help us I can't save you
[1:23:36] you got to save yourself you got a call
[1:23:40] on God you've got to meet God in that
[1:23:42] place message how I overcome here
[1:23:47] sanctify us Lord fill us anew with the
[1:23:50] Holy Spirit may the Holy Ghost just
[1:23:52] reign in our hearts and supremely that
[1:23:55] will walk forgetting the things that are
[1:23:58] in the past the muck and the mire that
[1:24:01] we once lived in will press toward the
[1:24:04] mark of our heart calling where our
[1:24:06] lights can so shine and sweetness and
[1:24:09] humility till every passerby can say
[1:24:12] there's a Christian lives lives there on
[1:24:16] that hill that person that woman that
[1:24:18] man is a real consecrated flower of God
[1:24:21] they're so sweet and so kind always
[1:24:24] and sweet and understanding granted
[1:24:27] father let us be salty that the earth
[1:24:31] might thirst granite that's easy wasn't
[1:24:34] saying that's the whole purpose about
[1:24:36] being salty you know you know the olden
[1:24:39] days that's the way they preserve their
[1:24:40] meat they mainly salted it you know like
[1:24:44] your beef jerky and stuff you know I
[1:24:46] heard that even this morning I'm like
[1:24:48] don't you understand God wants us to be
[1:24:50] salty so if somebody wouldn't lick off
[1:24:53] of us they'd get thirsty for the same
[1:24:55] thing we are that's what God likes you
[1:24:58] saw all brother Brooks are you being too
[1:25:00] hard I'm not being hard enough I really
[1:25:03] believe that people of God something's
[1:25:05] happening to us spiritually and y'all
[1:25:06] not fighting it is a dangerous time you
[1:25:10] know people say well see that's that's
[1:25:13] the danger you know when we preach all
[1:25:15] the Lord is justified you as though
[1:25:18] you've never said in the first place
[1:25:19] people get legs laxmi they get last no
[1:25:25] matter what I did God done justified me
[1:25:27] so I'm gonna be alright that's not it
[1:25:31] was it James said if you have faith I
[1:25:34] want to see your works hallelujah and
[1:25:38] you got to put a balance to that thing
[1:25:41] Ron Paul said you don't need it but
[1:25:43] James said you do in the eyes of me and
[1:25:46] you need it in the eyes of God you don't
[1:25:48] but you and I must realize by the grace
[1:25:51] of God I don't want nobody to know me
[1:25:54] outside of being a Christian I heard a
[1:26:01] man
[1:26:01] kind of mark God well you know Jesus
[1:26:03] walked on the water he said I'd better
[1:26:05] be careful because I'm gonna get in
[1:26:07] trouble I said mm-hmm yeah you're gonna
[1:26:10] get in trouble now if you don't get in
[1:26:13] trouble with God you're gonna get in
[1:26:14] trouble with me because you say another
[1:26:15] thing right see why because you and I
[1:26:19] are here to stand as witnesses oh and
[1:26:23] I'm going to talk to this fellow you
[1:26:24] know I've asked God to give me the
[1:26:26] perfect time I'm gonna talk to him to
[1:26:27] let him know that's my god and he did
[1:26:30] walked on water what you believe it or
[1:26:32] not he did if he didn't he did it just
[1:26:38] how can he heal me the many times he
[1:26:40] healed me delivered me how he delivered
[1:26:43] me that was mind over matter that was
[1:26:47] God over matter and you and I must
[1:26:51] realize him and we've got a stand he
[1:26:53] meant for Christ somebody said well I
[1:26:57] you know I I don't know I I you know I
[1:27:00] might be foolish virgin you are foolish
[1:27:03] person if you gonna think like that in
[1:27:06] the world ain't no way in the world I'm
[1:27:07] gonna give the devil no glory in that I
[1:27:09] ain't gonna ever say no I'm not no
[1:27:11] foolish virgin first of all I don't want
[1:27:13] to miss the rapture and I do not want to
[1:27:16] go through the white throne judgment I'd
[1:27:19] let the devil take that from me God
[1:27:21] didn't call me to this message to make
[1:27:23] me foolish is this okay I'm almost done
[1:27:31] God is good but God is also a consuming
[1:27:35] fire what I'm trying to say do y'all
[1:27:37] understand what I'm trying to get to I'm
[1:27:38] trying to say if we're going to
[1:27:40] experience the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ in our life we must lay aside
[1:27:44] every weight and sin that does so easily
[1:27:47] beset us we've got to get focused
[1:27:49] amen that we have been called to make a
[1:27:52] rapture and we have it it ain't just oh
[1:27:54] when I get to the rapture but the
[1:27:56] rapture suppose be seen in you every day
[1:27:58] the resurrection people supposed to see
[1:28:01] Christ in you if not by word by deed you
[1:28:07] know we didn't just this brothers
[1:28:09] there's no one of us exempt you don't
[1:28:11] have to be a preacher to have the signs
[1:28:13] following you
[1:28:15] these signs shall follow them all
[1:28:25] despises all the riches of His goodness
[1:28:28] and forbearance and longsuffering do we
[1:28:31] despise that because that's what he's
[1:28:33] been doing he has really been low
[1:28:35] suffering he has been giving good he's
[1:28:39] good to us not knowing that the goodness
[1:28:43] of God leadeth thee to repentance what
[1:28:45] is he saying God's been good to you but
[1:28:47] he also wants you to repent the goodness
[1:28:50] of God should lead you to repentance not
[1:28:52] God spanking you but God you've been so
[1:28:55] good to me I want to live for you lord
[1:28:59] but after thy hardness and impotent
[1:29:03] heart treasure risk up unto thyself
[1:29:06] wrath against the day of wrath and
[1:29:09] revelation of the righteous judgment of
[1:29:12] God is that what we're going to do just
[1:29:14] let the devil make us heart hardened
[1:29:17] seeing that God has been so good to us
[1:29:18] millions and billions of people a man is
[1:29:21] going to hell never heard this message
[1:29:22] before and God has given you the
[1:29:24] opportunity to hear it and there still
[1:29:28] ain't good enough for you who were
[1:29:31] rendered to every man according to his
[1:29:33] deed to them who by patient continued in
[1:29:37] well doing seek for glory and honor and
[1:29:40] immortality and eternal life how many of
[1:29:42] us are that way but unto them that are
[1:29:45] continuous and do not obey the truth but
[1:29:48] obey unrighteousness indignation and
[1:29:50] wrath tribulation and anguish upon every
[1:29:53] soul of man that doeth evil of the Jews
[1:29:57] first and also of the Gentiles but glory
[1:30:01] honor and peace to every man that
[1:30:03] worketh good to the Jew first and also
[1:30:07] to the Gentile but there is no respecter
[1:30:10] person with God I'm a closed day
[1:30:15] my thing is I trust that something has
[1:30:19] been said now I believe with all my
[1:30:23] heart God gave me this message like
[1:30:28] all said I hope I didn't offend anyone
[1:30:30] but I did tell you the truth my thoughts
[1:30:33] is you know if if if our lives are not
[1:30:36] right if we've been slacking slow for
[1:30:38] with God you got to acknowledge it I
[1:30:40] can't I don't know all I know is that
[1:30:43] God means what he says and he says what
[1:30:46] do you mean and you and I need to
[1:30:48] examine ourselves to see whether we'd be
[1:30:50] in the faith if we're not overcome us is
[1:30:56] because you chooses not to be because
[1:30:59] God has given us the power to overcome
[1:31:01] he's given us the word to overcome
[1:31:05] overcome means you got to fight when we
[1:31:10] come don't mean it's coming are you easy
[1:31:11] it means you have to fight and if you
[1:31:14] want to overcome you got to fight
[1:31:16] yourself you got to deny yourself that
[1:31:20] God may reign hmm none of us got it easy
[1:31:24] I know I talked to the sisters and let
[1:31:28] me tell you something I know it's
[1:31:29] difficult for y'all I know y'all have a
[1:31:32] hard time
[1:31:32] oh yeah we're right into Satan's Eden
[1:31:36] with it
[1:31:37] whether the demons of lust and
[1:31:40] everything else it's raining even when
[1:31:42] you don't look at somebody they coming
[1:31:44] after you those Devils are out there and
[1:31:48] I feel sorry for the brethren really
[1:31:51] those serpent chicks out there half
[1:31:55] naked and everything else I do but do
[1:32:00] you think God equipped us in adequately
[1:32:04] God did not equipped us in adequately
[1:32:10] matter of fact Paul boast on to me said
[1:32:13] I'm more than a conqueror is that right
[1:32:19] and the Bible says greater he that is in
[1:32:21] us than he that is in the world I
[1:32:25] believe that I know that to be true in
[1:32:31] closing this morning on this portion I
[1:32:34] want to exhort you and try to
[1:32:39] encourage you that the only way you
[1:32:41] understand what I'm trying to say if you
[1:32:45] don't understand go to God in prayer I'm
[1:32:51] gonna read a couple of scriptures here
[1:32:52] now close that session a few things that
[1:32:56] I must do I think I want to read
[1:33:02] Galatians here Galatians 262 lessons the
[1:33:14] sixth chapter beginning at the first
[1:33:18] verse brethren if a man be overtaken in
[1:33:26] a fault ye which are spiritual restore
[1:33:31] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:33:35] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:33:40] tempted you don't know what that means
[1:33:45] it means you know you don't go to
[1:33:48] restore somebody with the thought see
[1:33:50] you reap what you sow you're supposed to
[1:33:54] go with compassion with love and
[1:33:59] understanding bear ye one another's
[1:34:04] burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:34:08] that means if you don't have the burden
[1:34:11] or the struggle that that individual
[1:34:12] have you bear with you pray with them
[1:34:16] until they overcome because see you
[1:34:22] yourselves can be overtaken with and by
[1:34:27] the same spirit if you don't approach it
[1:34:31] carefully that is the only way that this
[1:34:35] church should grow we must well you know
[1:34:40] you say well that's their business but I
[1:34:44] think that's exactly what Cain said to
[1:34:47] God and my brother's keeper
[1:35:03] bear with me
[1:35:28] my 4:30
[1:35:38] just baptized a few people you know I I
[1:35:44] just believe that when a person come to
[1:35:47] Christ and say Lord I really want to be
[1:35:49] a servant
[1:35:50] you know the outward appearance was
[1:35:53] changed too that's when they know some
[1:35:55] people don't know but I can remember
[1:35:59] when I had a lot long hair yeah I mean
[1:36:03] it's hard to believe that now but I did
[1:36:08] it and you know coming to Christ was
[1:36:10] very wonderful to me but I had already
[1:36:13] made a covenant that I was never going
[1:36:14] to cut my hair
[1:36:16] well I shortly after I got saved I
[1:36:19] realized that my hair was too long so I
[1:36:23] did get it trimmed one of those old
[1:36:27] godly sisters come and say brother when
[1:36:30] you gonna get your hair cut I thought to
[1:36:33] myself I just gotta cut she said no no
[1:36:37] no no no you need to get a little you
[1:36:39] know cut a little more so I went I got a
[1:36:43] cut again that's more money I come to
[1:36:48] church I'm thinking all praise the Lord
[1:36:52] somebody else have a brother when you
[1:36:54] gonna get your hair cut I went to the
[1:36:58] barber I cut it all off then one of my
[1:37:04] friends saw me in the street my worldly
[1:37:07] friends say what does it happen to you
[1:37:10] I've never seen you look so ugly you see
[1:37:20] what the devil was trying to do make me
[1:37:21] desire to get my hair back but I never
[1:37:24] did take it back to that lake by God's
[1:37:26] grace cuz I knew it was the will of the
[1:37:28] Lord amen so here here I'm saying to you
[1:37:31] folks if God say he beautify the meek
[1:37:34] with salvation that's exactly what it
[1:37:36] says
[1:37:38] Jeremiah 430 i'ma read and when thou art
[1:37:41] spoiled or what without Duke though thou
[1:37:45] clothe thyself with chrism and those I
[1:37:48] decade the with ornaments of gold and
[1:37:52] so thou ringeth our faith with painting
[1:37:54] see because well he'll paint your face
[1:37:55] and about what it is you're not supposed
[1:37:58] to do that sisters in vain without
[1:38:01] making ourselves fair it's vanity he
[1:38:06] didn't say you weren't fair it did eat
[1:38:08] and say it wasn't gonna make you pretty
[1:38:10] but brother Bell said a woman don't make
[1:38:13] herself up to meet God they make
[1:38:15] themselves up to meet man that lover
[1:38:19] will despise thee they will seek their
[1:38:22] life so you end up with getting
[1:38:25] something that you don't want or need I
[1:38:28] thought I'd throw that out at just
[1:38:30] because I see that stuff slipping and
[1:38:33] coming in in such a way that I will not
[1:38:36] be guilty it's not one person I can make
[1:38:39] not do that but you will know it's wrong
[1:38:44] another situation I've got I'm gonna let
[1:38:47] you go and after I've done this Matthew
[1:38:50] 18 please
[1:38:59] how many y'all love the Lord I believe
[1:39:02] that I believe you do I do - are you
[1:39:08] perfect no I'm headed that way and I'm
[1:39:11] perfect in him but I want to see
[1:39:13] perfection in every way Matthew 18
[1:39:20] beginning at the fifteenth verse
[1:39:27] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:39:31] against thee go and tell him his fault
[1:39:35] between thee and him alone if he shall
[1:39:40] hear thee thou has gained thy brother
[1:39:43] but if he will not hear thee then take
[1:39:47] with thee one or two more that in the
[1:39:51] amount of two or three witnesses every
[1:39:54] word may be established and if he shall
[1:39:59] neglect to hear them tell it unto the
[1:40:02] church but if the if he neglect to hear
[1:40:05] the church let him be unto thee as a
[1:40:09] heathen man and a publican verily I say
[1:40:14] unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on
[1:40:16] earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:40:18] whatsoever you shall loose on earth
[1:40:22] shall be loosed in heaven and again I
[1:40:25] say unto you that if two of you shall
[1:40:29] agree on earth as touching anything that
[1:40:32] they shall ask it shall be done for
[1:40:35] afford them of my father which is in
[1:40:38] heaven
[1:40:38] for where two or three are gathered
[1:40:41] together in my name there I am in the
[1:40:45] midst and you know there saying this I
[1:40:52] want you to understand you know brother
[1:40:56] Branham said that's the reason why so
[1:40:58] many churches are failing is because we
[1:41:02] don't follow this prescription you go to
[1:41:06] the denominational Church you go to
[1:41:08] message church everybody look at this
[1:41:10] scripture like it's the meanest thing
[1:41:12] that can be done and here the whole
[1:41:18] thing behind this is to make sure a
[1:41:21] person's soul is saved to make sure by
[1:41:26] God's grace amen that winners out of the
[1:41:30] pastor's hands when it's out of the
[1:41:32] church hands you then place that
[1:41:34] individual in the hands of God and
[1:41:37] that's what we do you said well brother
[1:41:42] was who are you speaking of you haven't
[1:41:45] seen my daughter grace here for a while
[1:41:47] I love my daughter she she's really
[1:41:50] upset with me because I had to approach
[1:41:52] her again yesterday and she called me
[1:41:56] mean things and why don't you do this to
[1:41:58] other people and let me say it like this
[1:42:01] if you all see other people doing
[1:42:03] something wrong and you do not approach
[1:42:05] them about it God will hold you
[1:42:08] responsible but that's why I read
[1:42:10] Galatians 6 and 1 you teach your brother
[1:42:14] overtaken in a fault you go to them
[1:42:17] tried to win them back right and you're
[1:42:22] going meekness you're going love when
[1:42:23] you don't do that
[1:42:24] you're breaking the word ain't about
[1:42:27] your feelings oh well I'm afraid for
[1:42:30] them that ain't what the Bible said the
[1:42:31] Bible said go to this and that's the
[1:42:34] issue that we're having among believers
[1:42:36] we're so afraid that we're gonna lose a
[1:42:38] friend at the end of the day that person
[1:42:41] is going to thank you for helping them
[1:42:45] now I talked to my daughter and I mean
[1:42:47] I'm talking to any and everybody in here
[1:42:49] fornication adultery anything of that
[1:42:51] manner that's just not right I'm not
[1:42:55] telling you what all she's doing I'm not
[1:42:58] going into detail but my point is this
[1:43:01] I'm trying to save her I love my
[1:43:06] daughter but she's not hearing others
[1:43:11] have gone to her her my wife and I have
[1:43:14] gone to her she's not hearing and she
[1:43:16] doing things that are not right so I
[1:43:19] told her yesterday as of today I'm
[1:43:22] giving her 30 days to repent
[1:43:26] get back with God and if she doesn't
[1:43:30] hear the church then we will
[1:43:32] excommunicate her until she repents
[1:43:36] that's the Bible you understand
[1:43:40] and so you understand this has been
[1:43:47] going on for years correction has been
[1:43:52] tried over and over again
[1:43:55] I believe the coming of the Lord is at
[1:43:58] hand and just like I told her I'd rather
[1:44:02] God I rather I'd rather deal with her
[1:44:07] and whoever else then to have to deal
[1:44:09] with God not just her people of God
[1:44:14] something's going on in here among us
[1:44:18] I don't know what it is but God will
[1:44:20] reveal it because whatever you're doing
[1:44:22] the dark God is going to bring it to the
[1:44:24] light and if we're gonna be a real acts
[1:44:30] 2:38 Church he said what brother Brooks
[1:44:34] you've been I've done no yes I make
[1:44:37] right I confess my sin hello
[1:44:46] you're not supposed to cover like that
[1:44:49] that's like covering for a can you know
[1:44:51] he stole those garment but I ain't gonna
[1:44:53] tell nobody you die where they can
[1:44:57] that's all I'm saying people God we
[1:44:59] can't allow this wicked stuff I don't
[1:45:01] care what it is it's about repentance
[1:45:05] and that's when you come to know who is
[1:45:07] of God and who is not these are also
[1:45:12] tragical things I'm not expecting
[1:45:14] nothing tragical to happen I'm expecting
[1:45:17] God to deal with her heart you
[1:45:20] understand me
[1:45:21] I'm expecting God to do whatever is
[1:45:24] necessary to save my daughter she's
[1:45:29] overtaken and all is well you don't love
[1:45:34] me no I'm doing it because I do love you
[1:45:39] don't have a place for revenge in my
[1:45:41] heart I don't have that comic evenness
[1:45:43] in me that I want to strike somebody
[1:45:45] down because they offended me no sir
[1:45:50] my heart no God knows my heart and I am
[1:45:54] seeking to get her saved and whoever
[1:45:58] else there's things I got on my list
[1:46:00] that I got to do and by God's grace I'm
[1:46:03] gonna do everything he's telling me to
[1:46:05] do hmm
[1:46:08] y'all must understand if I'm just
[1:46:10] standing alone I stand alone and and my
[1:46:14] point is I'm not saying what I'm saying
[1:46:16] to get anybody's approval I'm saying
[1:46:19] what I'm saying because you're the
[1:46:21] church and you need to know you
[1:46:25] understand we can't have it and we won't
[1:46:29] God in this place you make a choice we
[1:46:32] won't God I've not come this far to be
[1:46:35] lost or to be left behind
[1:46:38] and I heard brother Brennan said many of
[1:46:41] Christians all go to miss the rapture
[1:46:43] because of their families I'm sorry I'm
[1:46:48] not one of them no way I'm not one of
[1:46:54] them you love the Lord not trying to
[1:46:58] take away your joy I'm just saying I
[1:47:00] need your prayers if any of you have her
[1:47:03] phone number call her maybe you can
[1:47:06] encourage her maybe she'll know she's
[1:47:08] got friends because that's one of the
[1:47:10] reasons why she stopped coming cause
[1:47:11] there was no offense nobody want to be
[1:47:15] her friend she comes and nobody make
[1:47:16] friends nobody is interested so what
[1:47:20] happens she goes out in the world and do
[1:47:22] what she does everybody needs somebody
[1:47:25] and if you can't find friendship among
[1:47:28] your so-called believers now some people
[1:47:33] made up they don't need that they don't
[1:47:35] need friends they they like to be alone
[1:47:37] but most people are not that way I don't
[1:47:41] like being alone
[1:47:42] I love fellowship you love God
[1:47:48] people we got ministries among each
[1:47:52] other let's not fail God by not reaching
[1:47:57] out to one another when you see somebody
[1:47:59] got a frown and not a smile you love the
[1:48:03] Lord can we stand and pray before this
[1:48:05] missile father God we come before you
[1:48:16] and we thank you for your maids and
[1:48:20] Grace we pray father God that you will
[1:48:24] be merciful to us and to my daughter I
[1:48:29] pray that you would grant her repentance
[1:48:32] Satan has his anointing owner at this
[1:48:37] present time but I know log on in the
[1:48:41] depths of her heart she knows the truth
[1:48:44] and that I love him I pray father God
[1:48:47] that you break those yokes before that
[1:48:53] time come so we won't have to go that
[1:48:56] measure grant her repentance open her
[1:49:01] eyes that she may see my concerns for
[1:49:05] her soul help us now in your name Lord
[1:49:09] Jesus Christ we pray that your perfect
[1:49:13] will be done as we are dismissed father
[1:49:18] let us not give ear to gossip but may we
[1:49:26] all pray and seek your face and what to
[1:49:31] do in this matter if we could only look
[1:49:34] at her as if as though it was ourselves
[1:49:40] then our compassion for her would
[1:49:43] overflow we need one another law and if
[1:49:47] the church doesn't stand in the gap and
[1:49:52] what good is it help us now
[1:49:57] bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we
