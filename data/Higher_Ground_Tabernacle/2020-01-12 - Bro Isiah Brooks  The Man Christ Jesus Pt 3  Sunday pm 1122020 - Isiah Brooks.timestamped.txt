[15:48] I'm standing on the promises of God amen
[16:00] hallelujah
[16:01] we're just going to get right into the
[16:03] Word of God we appreciate everybody here
[16:07] this evening still working on that
[16:14] revelation hallelujah
[16:19] as we say the revelation of Jesus Christ
[16:24] it's not something that you learn a have
[16:27] in your head it must be in your heart
[16:29] that's where the throne of God is in
[16:33] your heart and not in your head
[16:38] my Hebrews 12 please Hebrews 12
[16:55] you know my thing is with me it's just I
[16:58] can't get enough of him while other
[17:02] people feel like they've had enough but
[17:06] myself I cannot get enough you know I'm
[17:11] the kind of person if I could get three
[17:13] meals a day I'll do that yeah I don't
[17:17] settle for one meal a day but some
[17:20] people spiritually that's what they do
[17:22] they don't realize Amen they're there
[17:25] cutting themselves off from the blessing
[17:29] and the nutrition nutrients of the Word
[17:32] of God because of work because we're
[17:35] living in a day that most people first
[17:37] of all most people are now they hate
[17:40] reading and because of technology it
[17:43] makes it easy for us to learn without
[17:46] reading ourselves sometimes we just
[17:49] click on something and it'll read for us
[17:53] after a while we get to a place where we
[17:56] won't have to work and most of us like
[17:58] that now we don't have to remember
[18:00] anything we tell Siri to do it for us so
[18:04] we know by God's grace that the devil in
[18:07] himself is really dumbing us down in
[18:10] every way that he possibly can I could
[18:13] remember the time when I was younger you
[18:15] had to remember everybody's phone number
[18:18] as well as address
[18:19] don't ask me who's off numbers I
[18:23] remember now because it's between me and
[18:25] my wife and that's it
[18:27] I used to have a record a real mind
[18:32] where I could remember things and places
[18:35] and times but you know the society in
[18:38] which we're living in now helps us to
[18:41] forget and that's how it is on the job
[18:44] everything is placed within the computer
[18:46] so when the computer goes down most of
[18:49] the people that's working don't know
[18:51] what next to do because we rely on the
[18:54] machines instead of our ourselves and I
[18:57] can remember the time when human beings
[18:59] were called computers because they knew
[19:02] how to work math in such a way they
[19:05] didn't have machines they had people who
[19:07] could break things down
[19:09] you know do all of the algebra in
[19:12] calculus and everything else just by
[19:14] heart but nowadays you just can't find
[19:17] that kind of a person not here in
[19:21] America anyway maybe so where's our
[19:23] coffee somewhere but we have become a
[19:25] nation that is so dependent upon science
[19:28] till it's very difficult to rely on God
[19:32] but as we read at Hebrews 12 24 and to
[19:38] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[19:40] and to the blood speak of speaking of
[19:45] sprinkling excuse me that speaketh
[19:47] better thing than that of Abel let's go
[19:52] back to one scripture that we had on
[19:54] this morning
[19:58] first Timothy 2:5 through 6
[20:08] and it reads but there is one god one
[20:11] mediator between God and man the man
[20:15] Christ Jesus
[20:18] let us pray father we thank you for your
[20:21] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[20:23] being so good to us
[20:25] I pray Lord God that you touch the
[20:27] bodies this evening that's tired the
[20:30] Lord revived our souls revive us Lord oh
[20:33] god we thank you right now for this
[20:35] lovely evening that you have given to us
[20:37] we realize that at this moment we have
[20:39] our freedom to preach and to teach your
[20:43] word but we know Lord God there's coming
[20:46] a time when places like this will be
[20:49] shut down and won't be allowed to preach
[20:51] so therefore God we've taken advantage
[20:54] of this time and we thank your father
[20:57] for giving us this time to lift your
[21:00] name up and Dupre's you Father blessed
[21:03] the service bless those of who are here
[21:06] this evening though we be few in number
[21:09] we we thank you God because you promised
[21:12] to be here and we know that you are have
[21:15] dine on way in Jesus Christ's name we
[21:17] pray amen
[21:19] you may be seated as you heard me say on
[21:28] this morning when it comes to the Lord
[21:31] Jesus Christ I I'm jealous
[21:34] in the way that the Bible said that his
[21:38] name is jealous and if we who are though
[21:42] are born-again believers we are named
[21:45] after him so when we see anything a
[21:49] being exalted above the name of Jesus
[21:53] Christ it throws an alarm on we ought to
[21:58] reflect Jesus Christ and as you have
[22:01] heard me say you're reflecting something
[22:04] from somewhere you're free reflection
[22:07] here on earth will is either reflecting
[22:11] heavenly things or it is reflecting
[22:15] things from the other world and we know
[22:18] that there are two worlds that we know
[22:20] we call heaven and the other world we
[22:23] call the underworld we know that there
[22:26] are those people people who are on earth
[22:28] that are ordained to reflect heaven and
[22:32] there are people on earth who are
[22:35] ordained to reflect hell and God has
[22:40] delivered us because the Bible tells us
[22:42] that we all had the appearance of the
[22:46] children of Wrath and yet God in His
[22:49] mercy delivered us and brought us into a
[22:55] place where we can be perfect and we we
[23:02] must understand that even according to
[23:06] Hebrews 11 and 40 when it talks about
[23:11] all of those who have gone on before us
[23:16] those who are real see germs of God
[23:22] Christians if we would say or those who
[23:25] were genuine Jehovah Witnesses who
[23:28] literally lived for God during their
[23:32] time they didn't count this world or
[23:37] anything my fact the Bible
[23:41] that the world wasn't even worthy to
[23:43] have them and and they came they some of
[23:48] them died for the name of God they some
[23:51] of them had to be destitute some of them
[23:53] were poor and you know some fair to
[23:56] lions and all of these things were done
[23:59] in the name of the Lord these people are
[24:04] they faced there are how can I said
[24:08] their challenges they faced the the
[24:12] things that God has ordained for them to
[24:14] go through they faced those things and
[24:17] they went through the Bible says some of
[24:20] them are yet not seeing their victory
[24:24] game that y'all died in victory because
[24:27] they're new they knew that a greater
[24:29] Hope was coming now you and I the Bible
[24:32] tells us that we have a greater work
[24:37] because the Bible says like this God
[24:41] having provided some better thing for us
[24:43] that they without us should not be made
[24:48] perfect so the weight if I can say it
[24:53] like this of the whole pyramid coming to
[24:58] his completion is upon us now I want to
[25:03] say that because the whole creation is
[25:06] groaning and waiting for the
[25:11] manifestations of the sons of God
[25:13] now we ourselves must understand it is
[25:19] not the ability of a man that brings us
[25:23] to perfection not by power not by light
[25:26] but by my spirit said the Lord
[25:29] it's not him that will it doggie that
[25:31] run it but as God who shows mercy and if
[25:35] we can fully understand that this whole
[25:39] entire thing rest upon the election of
[25:43] God is that right it is because God
[25:46] chose you you didn't choose God it's
[25:49] because God elected you you could not
[25:52] have elected yourself
[25:54] so God put himself a mint in the harness
[25:58] if I could say it like that because the
[26:01] Word of God says he that began a good
[26:04] work in you is faithful to complete it
[26:07] so God who started to work in you have
[26:10] always placed already placed a word in
[26:13] there that that he himself must follow
[26:17] through this is the beauty of it the
[26:20] beauty of it is that when God told
[26:23] Abraham I'm giving you a covenant and
[26:25] this covenant is an unconditional
[26:27] covenant and to make you see that the
[26:31] covenant which I have made for you is
[26:34] worthy and is I am going to swear by
[26:40] myself
[26:41] in other words heaven and earth will
[26:43] pass away but my words shall stand the
[26:48] Covenant in which I give unto you is
[26:50] unconditional and this is the way it
[26:54] works now you said well what do you mean
[26:57] because I want you to understand the
[27:01] Bible tells us that be perfect for your
[27:05] father which is in heaven is perfect
[27:07] there is not one man born of a woman
[27:13] that's perfect well you see well the
[27:17] Bible says that Joel was perfect but
[27:21] Joel wasn't born perfect Jobe was born
[27:25] of a woman and job understood the power
[27:30] of the sacrifice he understood the blood
[27:34] sacrifice of the animal hallelujah
[27:37] because the Bible tells us without the
[27:40] shedding of blood there is no remission
[27:42] of sin Enoch was perfect but he was not
[27:47] perfect of himself Enoch had the
[27:49] revelation that Ava had and the blood
[27:54] prevailed that's what made a not perfect
[27:57] he wasn't just a man born of a woman
[27:59] come on Lonnie
[28:01] because you and I born of a woman we
[28:03] were born hybrid we were born part
[28:06] serpent
[28:07] and partly you don't believe that that's
[28:12] why circumcision was killing to cut off
[28:15] the surplus part that's why the holy
[28:18] ghost is given to cut off the serpents
[28:21] part it is to kill the serpent in you
[28:25] hallelujah oh yes so you and I must
[28:29] realize that this this thing is is all
[28:33] about the grace of God I know we like
[28:38] doing right those who are born again
[28:40] they are righteous they love to do the
[28:44] right things of God they enjoy praying
[28:47] they enjoy fasting they enjoy those
[28:50] things that will bring them closer to
[28:52] God but you can do all of that and still
[28:57] be lost because it's not by your works
[29:01] is by the grace of God it will always be
[29:07] election it will always be God choosing
[29:12] you is that right God was never lost
[29:16] y'all hear me somebody it was able a men
[29:20] it was scuse me yes it was Adam and Eve
[29:23] who was lost and he never saw God it was
[29:28] God who sought Avenue where art thou
[29:32] right so it was that principle it was
[29:36] that thing man never sees God
[29:39] they said I sought the Lord and I found
[29:41] him only because God was drawing you how
[29:47] can you be perfect the only way you can
[29:51] be perfect will be through the death of
[29:53] Christ not through joining church not
[29:57] through our good works what we do that's
[30:00] all right
[30:01] not because we're baptized this way or
[30:04] that way not because that we've been
[30:06] healed by laying of hands and not
[30:09] because of any of these other things we
[30:12] believe in the death burial and
[30:14] resurrection
[30:16] Paul said I could speak with tongues
[30:18] like men of angels that
[30:21] the tongues that is understood in the
[30:24] toes that are that cannot be understood
[30:26] has to be interpreted I am noting though
[30:30] I have a gift of knowledge and
[30:32] understand all wisdom of God can explain
[30:35] the Bible is that right
[30:38] Tyler together I am nothing don't do
[30:41] much good to go to school then does it
[30:45] to learn the Bible though I have faith
[30:47] that I can move mountains healing
[30:50] campaigns don't mean very much then does
[30:53] it I'm nothing though I give my body to
[30:57] be burned as a sacrifice oh they say
[31:00] that man original is religious but it is
[31:03] nothing Paul said never becomes nothing
[31:07] what for where there is tongues they
[31:12] shall cease where there is prophecy it
[31:15] shall fail where there is all these
[31:17] other things it'll fail but when that
[31:21] which is perfect is come that which is
[31:24] in part will be done away with see that
[31:27] perfect
[31:28] what is perfect love what is love God
[31:32] let us lay aside all these other these
[31:36] little dead works and ordinances and go
[31:39] on into perfection you see it will
[31:43] perfected through Christ how do we get
[31:46] into it by the Holy Ghost baptism and
[31:49] when you baptize with the Holy Ghost
[31:51] that is just the beginning
[31:54] hallelujah you've got to grow into
[31:57] perfection when I was sitting there
[32:00] standing in my office's evening the
[32:03] Bible brother the Lord said unto me what
[32:07] does her baby have to do in order to
[32:12] grow in his mother's womb nothing what
[32:18] does a baby do to even be conceived
[32:21] nothing everything Amen is ordered by
[32:26] God hallelujah from the time it comes of
[32:31] conception to the very time of
[32:34] deliverance from that time all God is in
[32:37] control hallelujah that baby if it had
[32:40] brown hair right here whatever color
[32:43] hair had nothing to do with it it was
[32:46] God who chose that it was God who
[32:49] elected dad hallelujah but the law was
[32:52] in in the sea the law is in the blood
[32:57] the law is in the DNA of the blood your
[33:01] understanding so when the blood of Jesus
[33:04] Christ has been applied to your life it
[33:07] is the law of that bladder that makes
[33:10] you overcome it makes you an overcomer
[33:15] hallelujah if the life of the dog is a
[33:18] dog in sudah hallelujah and God gives
[33:22] you a transfusion if you Zach oh and you
[33:24] had a transfusion a blood transfusion a
[33:27] change of nature to a dog it doesn't
[33:30] matter how black you are you will live
[33:33] like a dog because the life of it has
[33:37] been changed you didn't make the change
[33:41] God made the change
[33:43] oooh that's why he said see these
[33:47] principles touch not taste not handle
[33:49] not these are denominational laws that
[33:52] we have all had experienced experienced
[33:55] some of them if not all of them but he
[33:58] says now you got to go beyond that
[33:59] because you can taste not taste not
[34:02] handle dot Amen and you do you no good
[34:04] you've got to be seed let's go on to
[34:07] perfection let the life of Christ in you
[34:10] bring you to that perfection yet not by
[34:13] your doing not by your works but by the
[34:15] grace of God by God coming in and living
[34:20] that life through you that's the
[34:22] perfection we want not by our own
[34:26] perfection because that's what the
[34:28] Pharisees did they had their own
[34:30] perfection they had their own
[34:32] righteousness they had their own
[34:34] holiness and God said but you're dead
[34:36] men bones see what I'm saying and here
[34:39] was a woman at the well who had nothing
[34:41] but a prostitution life and God
[34:43] quickened that seat and she had a
[34:44] righteousness that was far beyond the
[34:47] righteous
[34:47] the Pharisees and the Bible said a leg
[34:50] except we are righteousness exceed the
[34:52] righteousness of the Pharisees you won't
[34:55] make it fine
[34:56] our righteousness must come from God not
[34:59] because of our dues and adults not
[35:02] because of the way we look or the way we
[35:04] act is God in you the hope of glory
[35:10] woo oh I feel like shouting hallelujah
[35:16] see everything else is going to see
[35:18] tongues is going to cease hallelujah but
[35:22] what is law of God she let us lay aside
[35:24] all these little dead ordinance assist
[35:27] you said what do you mean brother Brooks
[35:28] if you change the nature the nature
[35:32] itself is the law you understand me
[35:36] let me say it like this if you change
[35:39] your nature from a man into the nature
[35:42] of God the nature itself becomes your
[35:45] law and then the law is not Grievous
[35:49] because however the nature is it's the
[35:51] way you're going to act it is what
[35:53] you're going to do it becomes so
[35:55] supernaturally natural it's no longer a
[35:58] burden that's why Jesus says my burden
[36:01] is easy my yoke is easy and my burden is
[36:03] light
[36:04] hallelujah because if I change you from
[36:07] the inside out you won't have to worry
[36:09] about doing nothing it will do it for
[36:12] you that right that's what brother and I
[36:15] mentioned when he says all you got to do
[36:17] is drink it in drinking and drinking in
[36:19] if you drink in the word drinking the
[36:21] word it'll push the life out and push
[36:23] the life out right you'll never see Amen
[36:27] a tree with a bandana around his hair
[36:30] says manners this is hard work trying to
[36:32] produce these fruits oh it's in the tree
[36:39] it's in the tree you stay in the
[36:42] presence of the Sun you where there's no
[36:45] way you can stay in the presence of the
[36:48] Shekinah glory and not come out perfect
[36:51] you will come out perfect because the
[36:54] Shekinah glory will transform you into
[36:57] perfection
[37:00] they don't try to have these any type of
[37:03] sensations and trying to make it place
[37:05] the Holy Spirit when a new birth has
[37:06] come you are changed and you know that's
[37:09] the truth
[37:10] that's one of the greatest deception of
[37:12] the Pentecostal church when they put you
[37:14] know put jumping or shouting or speaking
[37:17] in tongues and has the initial evidence
[37:19] and that it can be add evident it could
[37:21] be that something took place but you
[37:23] want to change if you have none of that
[37:27] and you got change you got more than the
[37:30] man has who has the tongues and
[37:32] interpretation and Cain live right it's
[37:35] change it's God changing your nature
[37:40] from the old man to the new man that
[37:42] right that's what the Word of God says
[37:44] we are a new creature a new creation old
[37:49] things are passed away behold all things
[37:52] have become new you're in a new path you
[37:55] in a new route and as we walk with Jesus
[37:58] like he not walk with God we get closer
[38:01] and closer to the change it's what it is
[38:05] hallelujah your life proves it as you
[38:08] walk you love your you will love peace
[38:12] and long-suffering gentleness meekness
[38:14] patience see all of these things will
[38:16] begin to develop in you you you don't
[38:19] add to it as to you it's something that
[38:23] happens is that right hallelujah all the
[38:27] time we're growing and don't even know
[38:29] that we're growing hmm can we look it at
[38:34] the flesh but what's on the inside how
[38:38] things are changing there you understand
[38:41] me this flesh gonna always give you
[38:43] trouble because it's dead it's been
[38:45] judged and what we fail to see is that
[38:47] God don't judge you according to the
[38:49] flesh once God has given you the Holy
[38:52] Ghost you are not judged according to
[38:54] the flesh I'm gonna say it again once
[38:57] God has given you the Holy Ghost you are
[38:59] not judged according to the flesh
[39:01] because your flesh is already judged
[39:03] that's why he gave me the Holy Ghost hey
[39:08] somebody help me I must say that again
[39:11] so you could better understand it
[39:13] chicas Jesus Christ was a judge for you
[39:15] every sin you were supposed every lick
[39:19] of wrath of God you supposed to get
[39:22] Jesus got it for you hallelujah he took
[39:26] it for you
[39:27] so you don't have to take it once you
[39:30] identify yourself with the lamb and the
[39:33] lamb identify himself with you amen he
[39:37] became your sin and you become his
[39:39] righteousness what a trade ha ha what a
[39:44] train see and the more you get see what
[39:49] you got to understand that sometime let
[39:52] me see you like this
[39:53] sometimes we the taste of the world just
[39:55] don't automatically lead so God has to
[39:59] let you go on until you get sick of it
[40:02] right it's like this you bought a pint
[40:05] of ice cream and you can only eat a half
[40:07] a pint but you don't told your dad how I
[40:10] eat at all and he know you can't eat a
[40:13] whole pint
[40:14] so he said but you gonna eat every bit
[40:16] of that ice cream
[40:17] and he know that ice cream is gonna make
[40:20] you sick but he knows that after you eat
[40:22] that pint
[40:23] you'll never ask for another one so God
[40:29] will let you do that he'll let you eat
[40:32] stuff and it's no they gonna make you
[40:34] sick you keep on going keep on going but
[40:37] the end of the day you'll get so sick of
[40:39] it you will never want to have anything
[40:40] else to do with it hallelujah that's how
[40:43] you know it took me a long time to enjoy
[40:46] a peanut butter again cuz when I was a
[40:48] boy I should take peanut butter and just
[40:50] grab it by the big spoon and just it was
[40:53] like my popsicle my whatever if I walked
[40:56] the neighborhood eating my big spoon but
[40:59] one day a big lump a peanut butter got
[41:01] stuck back there somewhere in my throat
[41:04] and I couldn't get it out for days
[41:07] peanut butter was there I hated peanut
[41:12] butter for years you know but but you
[41:15] know what it was it was my glutton it
[41:17] was my my selfishness I wanted to make
[41:20] sure I got my share of the peanut butter
[41:22] I got mine and somebody else's you know
[41:26] but
[41:27] I will allow those kind of things to
[41:29] happen to train and to teach you you
[41:33] love the Lord Amen like I said this
[41:36] morning when you come out of her Amen is
[41:38] because we're born into a kingdom see
[41:41] where we're not oh I gotta separate
[41:44] myself know when you're born into this
[41:48] kingdom
[41:48] you are totally separated y'all
[41:51] understand me it's like a baby when he
[41:53] was in the mother womb he was in a
[41:54] kingdom when that baby is born he's born
[41:57] outside a mom into another Kingdom cut
[42:02] the cord it's done you're in another
[42:07] Kingdom you'll never be able to live
[42:09] like you lived in your mama's womb
[42:11] hallelujah
[42:12] so is it with this way when you're born
[42:15] into God God cuts the cord and you'll
[42:18] never ever that are able to live in that
[42:21] world like you're living in this one man
[42:23] factor child is never designed to go
[42:25] back into the mother's womb ever and
[42:30] that's the way it is with a real
[42:32] born-again believer you may fall short
[42:34] but when a man really comes into the
[42:37] Holy Ghost I mean into the Holy Ghost
[42:38] I'm not talking about election now I'm
[42:40] coming the election has brought him into
[42:42] the Selah the Holy Ghost he'll never go
[42:44] back into the world he only goes back
[42:48] into the world because he's not yet been
[42:50] sealed hallelujah it doesn't mean he's
[42:53] not elected see what I'm saying because
[42:56] the prodigal saw it he was a son when he
[42:59] went back into the world but he had not
[43:01] received the ring in the seal y'all hear
[43:05] me it was at that time of his return is
[43:08] when he got in in his inheritance haha
[43:11] come on it because God sometime will let
[43:14] you go down to the pig swine to eat with
[43:18] the pigs in order for you to come to
[43:21] your senses of who you are and where you
[43:25] belong right oh it's true it's true it's
[43:30] true whoo
[43:30] hallelujah I've seen people who Bachelor
[43:33] and when they come back they're more
[43:34] fired in the world's who's been there
[43:36] all the time and in Scripture the
[43:38] prodigal son came and he was all
[43:40] fire and the son who never left God was
[43:44] jealous don't give you right to
[43:48] backslide but I'm saying you know God is
[43:58] good to us at that right so we realized
[44:01] amen
[44:02] this is what I love because nobody what
[44:05] no matter what people say the blood
[44:08] speaks and how can anybody say they feel
[44:12] oh the whole full of the Holy Ghost and
[44:13] don't hear the voice of God
[44:17] can't it doesn't work because the Holy
[44:21] Ghost is the life of the blood is that
[44:24] right now think about it Abel blood
[44:27] spoke God said I hear the voice of your
[44:31] brother crying so he wasn't dead he was
[44:36] still alive because he had the lamb
[44:39] sacrifice use me that placed him in a
[44:43] position where he was still living but
[44:47] the man who said this Abel's blood was
[44:50] calling for justice but the Bible said
[44:53] that it does Jesus Christ the Lamb of
[44:56] God he he has a more excellent sacrifice
[44:59] and his blood speaketh better things
[45:03] because Jesus Christ didn't call for
[45:07] justice he was full of grace and truth
[45:10] and what did he say on the Calvary
[45:14] Father forgive them for they know not
[45:17] what they do now how can a real
[45:21] Christian born again not be able to
[45:25] forgive when the voice is still in them
[45:28] if the voice of God is in you if the
[45:32] Lambs voice it will speak in the
[45:38] linkages the voice of God will speak
[45:41] through you for you and on your behalf
[45:46] hallelujah glory to God you know and I
[45:49] know I've tried every religion there was
[45:52] almost I was born
[45:54] Baptists from the Baptist I went to the
[45:57] Methodists from the Methodists I went to
[45:59] the Catholic from the Catholic I went to
[46:02] the Apostolic and from the Apostolic I
[46:06] came to the word I've heard every kind
[46:09] of voice there is and every vidas
[46:14] denominations you know and everybody
[46:16] says I'm right but you see there was
[46:18] always something that was not yet
[46:21] satisfying I wasn't completely satisfied
[46:25] in those particular churches in which I
[46:28] had visited but when I came to the
[46:30] message it was a satisfying taste it was
[46:35] something that was different from this
[46:38] one you know you can take a baby and you
[46:40] can kick take that baby and give it to
[46:42] another mother who's who's actually
[46:45] breastfeeding with that baby who's
[46:47] already know that that's not it they
[46:50] know without without you to say that
[46:53] this is not your mama right but you're
[46:55] going to but no they know you know why
[46:57] they know they know the difference
[46:59] between the heartbeats the baby knows
[47:02] the heartbeat of the mother hallelujah
[47:06] and you see this is why even now they
[47:08] they practice this thing that when a
[47:10] baby is born the daddy is there so the
[47:12] daddy can lay the baby on his chest so
[47:15] the baby can hear the rhythm feel the
[47:18] rhythm of the father and they're on the
[47:21] chances where the baby becomes connected
[47:24] amen to the Father
[47:26] something happens there that is
[47:28] scientifically unexplainable hallelujah
[47:31] so what I'm trying to say is we have
[47:34] maybe tried to nurse from every
[47:36] different type of mama Baptist Methodist
[47:39] Presbyterian everything else but it
[47:41] wasn't satisfying we refused it
[47:44] hallelujah but when we came to the
[47:46] breast of al-sharia something strucker's
[47:50] only inside and we knew we had really
[47:52] found mama or mama had found us right
[47:57] something satisfying it's the truth now
[48:01] i'ma tell you this truth if there was a
[48:03] greater message somebody would have to
[48:05] prove it to me and show it to me because
[48:07] I haven't seen
[48:08] than in my day that could open the Word
[48:11] of God like this and show me where I
[48:14] came from and where I'm going right and
[48:17] then all the churches that I've been to
[48:19] you know honestly all we we heard was
[48:22] little sermons on Shadrach Meshach and
[48:25] Abednego and Daniel in the lion's den
[48:28] huh come on yeah you know we you know
[48:33] maybe David and Goliath that was a good
[48:34] one but my point is that was it nobody
[48:39] else could tell us amen where we was in
[48:41] the scripture right we didn't see Esther
[48:44] we didn't know what else we just thought
[48:45] it was a story we didn't understand it
[48:48] was it was like a shout on the type of
[48:50] what a prophecy of what was to come
[48:53] hallelujah we didn't understand that
[48:56] when God took a root that and Naomi out
[49:01] of Moab we didn't understand we didn't
[49:03] see Israel we didn't see the Gentile
[49:05] bride we didn't see all of those things
[49:07] a man that was we were in the book just
[49:11] like he was in Adam we were in the Adam
[49:14] of God before the foundation of the
[49:18] world so this Bible just couldn't
[49:20] display him it had to display her - it
[49:24] was more than just the history Jesus
[49:28] Christ the Spirit of Jesus Christ is
[49:31] prophecy and so God put us in the book
[49:34] to prophesy and then he says listen I
[49:36] want you to understand this Bible is you
[49:40] you'll find your identity in this Bible
[49:48] it became satisfied see even though God
[49:55] he always veiled himself throughout the
[49:58] ages but this is the first time in
[50:02] history that God unveiled himself to his
[50:05] people
[50:09] who is somebody helped me here
[50:11] throughout all the ages that's all they
[50:15] could see they could only see Moses they
[50:19] could only see Joshua they can
[50:22] only see those great patriarchs and they
[50:23] could never see themselves in the
[50:25] picture but now God has unveiled himself
[50:29] and when God unveiled himself he took us
[50:31] back to the beginning and said there you
[50:34] were in Adam harden area and you
[50:40] traveled for thousands of years gene
[50:44] from gene the gene from gene the gene
[50:47] from gene the gene and God made sure
[50:49] that everything that he saw you in the
[50:51] natural you understand me why we came
[50:53] here because we had to have a physical
[50:56] house God wanted us to have a physical
[51:00] house hallelujah God came down to have a
[51:03] physical house so he can fellowship with
[51:06] his physical creation but God was before
[51:10] the physical he was spiritual that's why
[51:15] the Bible said no man I've seen God at
[51:16] any time except the Sun has declared him
[51:20] hallelujah so God was veiled hmm and
[51:24] that's what God did he even showed Adam
[51:27] is that right God even short Adam that
[51:30] he was so veiled from seeing that God
[51:34] veiled Adam and Eve in the beginning
[51:37] because they were naked and didn't even
[51:39] know it
[51:39] that's how pure God is he can see
[51:43] nakedness in this it still appear before
[51:45] him because he's a holy God he's a
[51:48] righteous God come on somebody and this
[51:52] is what I try to tell people I said
[51:54] don't you understand I mean even the way
[51:56] a baby is born a baby don't come out
[51:59] with clothing a baby is naked they're
[52:02] wearing way that God created man naked
[52:04] but the thing that the baby in our day
[52:07] comes out he comes without a veil he
[52:11] doesn't have a holy veil he comes out
[52:15] like a sinner you understand me but God
[52:18] said you must be born again
[52:21] I wonder for years how in the world we
[52:24] can be holy
[52:26] but God in such a perverted time is that
[52:29] right the Bible said you know you know
[52:32] even a proper God said this is a
[52:33] perverted age he said
[52:35] oh what a perversion what a age what a
[52:38] time how deceitful it is all these
[52:43] things and that's true think about the
[52:45] millions of people who are living
[52:48] righteously but are living according to
[52:51] their own righteousness and they think
[52:55] they're going to heaven they have failed
[53:00] to be placed under the blood of Jesus
[53:03] they have a covering of a denomination
[53:06] or organization come on somebody
[53:09] and those coverings will will be to God
[53:12] just like Adam and Eve's covering was
[53:14] when they were caught in sin hallelujah
[53:18] amen and the thing about this is because
[53:22] Adam and Eve knew they would make it
[53:25] even though they had a covering see the
[53:29] soul of man knows only the blood of
[53:32] Jesus Christ was satisfied only the
[53:35] blood of Jesus Christ can wash away my
[53:37] sin only the blood of Jesus Christ can
[53:41] clothe me hallelujah hallelujah all
[53:50] things and don't know it
[53:52] see a perverted spirit is in the man he
[53:55] is veiled from the lust of Satan and the
[54:00] women is - is is Satan experience of
[54:03] Great Society and you you know you know
[54:06] it's true because we have a veil of
[54:08] holiness if we look at people say well
[54:11] how can they do that if they do what
[54:15] they don't know they don't see them
[54:18] naked they see it sexy sexy it's the
[54:22] thing that they love sexy is beautiful
[54:25] and they don't know even saying sexy
[54:28] where that's coming from the Garden of
[54:31] Eden the farm because that's what it was
[54:34] all it was sexy hallelujah and
[54:37] reproduction was supposed to come by the
[54:39] word let me hurry up it is an age where
[54:43] where you and I see you paint how can I
[54:47] sit like this you can't change
[54:49] yourself but God can change you god
[54:53] don't care how perverted a person is how
[54:55] it up your life is you can be whatever
[54:58] Satan could have mold you into a
[55:00] three-headed monster but God is able to
[55:03] change you he's ever is able by his
[55:07] Spirit amen to bring you back into your
[55:10] original position with God he is the
[55:13] only one he keeps him the Easter God of
[55:17] transformation hallelujah amen God the
[55:21] day of conforming is Olga Luthor was
[55:25] conformist Wesley's working farmers
[55:27] hallelujah but the day of conforming is
[55:30] over god this is the day of transforming
[55:34] God changing you from glory to glory to
[55:37] glory to glory and to you into the
[55:40] complete image of God you can't do it
[55:43] but God can and the Bible said we have
[55:47] not because we ask not this is what
[55:50] prayer is all about you understand me I
[55:53] heard brother Adam said it like this he
[55:55] said I asked for forgiveness every day
[55:59] something's wrong with you if you don't
[56:01] ask for forgiveness every day you do
[56:03] something wrong
[56:04] every day it might be small but it's
[56:09] done little just as big as big
[56:12] woman's omission cold mission however
[56:16] you want to say just a thought just to
[56:19] action just for something you're always
[56:21] fighting in that way and you're always
[56:24] saying I forgive me love but you know
[56:27] what he says he says something's wrong
[56:29] with the person who don't automatically
[56:31] say forgive me Lord forgive me like
[56:34] you're going to wait till tomorrow to
[56:35] ask for forgiveness something ain't
[56:38] right with that because a true believer
[56:40] asks for forgiveness
[56:41] immediately just like that as soon as
[56:45] you do it you ask for forgiveness those
[56:48] are the kind that God can work because
[56:50] there's as soon as you ask forgiveness
[56:51] is gone and God can complete your growth
[56:56] but when you delay in your confession
[56:59] then God delay in his growing in your
[57:02] growing
[57:03] is that Alright hallelujah you know it's
[57:07] the truth
[57:08] we may not see it but we are living in
[57:11] such a a world everything is funny
[57:15] nobody take things for real and and I
[57:20] think I think the Christians are the one
[57:22] that's are more guilty of this we we get
[57:27] ease in Zion we take it easy
[57:32] you know when I'm elected I'm chosen of
[57:35] God I don't really have to do nothing
[57:38] God got it all under control
[57:39] that shows you ain't got nothing because
[57:43] the Holy Ghost works every day he don't
[57:46] he's doing something every day and
[57:47] that's the thing we fail to seek God on
[57:51] what he wants us to do on a daily basis
[57:54] you know we saw him he would tell us and
[57:57] then you know because he definitely
[57:59] tells us but if you're not under there
[58:01] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[58:03] you will ignore his voice it is what we
[58:08] do right let me hurry up I'm gonna bring
[58:12] on the point that I brought out
[58:13] Wednesday because this was such a good
[58:15] thing and you know you know the Bible
[58:20] says according to st. John 15:26 to 27
[58:24] but when the comforter is come whom I
[58:28] was sin unto you from the father even
[58:31] the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth
[58:33] from the father he shall testify of me
[58:37] and ye also shall bear witness because
[58:41] you have been with me from the beginning
[58:49] we need a shout in John in here today
[58:53] because we find out that the scripture
[58:56] according to 1st John 2 1 through 6 and
[58:59] I'm just going to read the first my
[59:01] little children these things write unto
[59:04] you that you sin not and if any man sin
[59:09] we have an advocate with the father
[59:11] Jesus Christ the righteous
[59:16] that same word like I said they're
[59:19] denied advocate is the same word
[59:22] comforta you know in our minds we think
[59:25] that God the comfort is gone he gonna
[59:28] run you know rock you like a baby
[59:31] rub your little scarred up knees no no
[59:33] no he's there as an advocate the
[59:39] comforter don't worry about it
[59:41] I got a judge I got a jury I got an
[59:44] attorney that's gonna make sure your
[59:47] case is dismissed hallelujah
[59:51] don't worry about your shortcomings
[59:53] y'all hear what I'm saying
[59:55] because this same word I will send you a
[59:58] comforter and that's why the prophet of
[1:00:00] God said that Jesus Christ became our
[1:00:02] jury our judge our turning and guess
[1:00:05] what he dismissed the case is that right
[1:00:08] he said you never sinned in the first
[1:00:12] place and that advocate is a person who
[1:00:19] speaks all right in support of your
[1:00:22] defense
[1:00:24] he said old brother what are you talking
[1:00:26] about
[1:00:27] just like Daniel curry then you curry
[1:00:30] who was a preacher this is a true story
[1:00:33] then your curry had a dream and he
[1:00:36] dreamed that he went to heaven he
[1:00:39] dreamed that he died and he went up to
[1:00:41] the gate and Gabriel could not find his
[1:00:46] name on the book he said baby it gotta
[1:00:49] be on there I was a preach owner he said
[1:00:53] I'm sorry the only thing I could tell
[1:00:55] you is that you must appeal to the white
[1:00:57] throne judgment he did all of a sudden
[1:01:01] he started traveling in this light and
[1:01:03] he said the more he traveled in the
[1:01:06] light they're more brighter if the
[1:01:07] brighter it became and all of a sudden
[1:01:09] he stood still he heard a voice he said
[1:01:18] standing in that state with Neville he
[1:01:20] said with every bone in me out of joint
[1:01:25] and trembling he said I heard that limit
[1:01:29] let me back up do me back up
[1:01:30] he said easier because he said Oh Lord I
[1:01:33] wasn't perfect see that's the thing in
[1:01:35] order to get in you got to be perfect
[1:01:37] that means that Daniel Curie was a
[1:01:39] preacher he was justified he was
[1:01:42] sanctified pretty much but he didn't
[1:01:44] have the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[1:01:45] Ghost is the only thing that makes you
[1:01:46] perfect he died and had to appeal to the
[1:01:53] white throne judgment this is a dream
[1:01:55] but he said it was the most frightening
[1:01:57] time of his life he said because the he
[1:02:00] was asked have you ever lied he said
[1:02:03] well he thought about it yeah yes Lord
[1:02:06] I've done some shady deals you know have
[1:02:10] you ever stolen yes yes Lord yes he said
[1:02:14] because in that light the least little
[1:02:16] thing that you've done becomes big it's
[1:02:20] visible and he said after answer to all
[1:02:23] the question because everything was yes
[1:02:25] I've done it yes I've done that oh I
[1:02:26] have not been perfect
[1:02:28] he said he stood there trembling with
[1:02:31] all of his bones disconnecting waiting
[1:02:34] to hear that voice depart from me you
[1:02:37] worker of iniquity he's a better stair
[1:02:40] standing there in that state every bone
[1:02:42] in me out of joint and trembling he said
[1:02:45] I heard the sweetest voice that I had
[1:02:47] ever heard in my life sweeter than any
[1:02:51] mother's voice I had ever heard and I
[1:02:54] said when I turned to look I saw the
[1:02:57] sweetest face that I had ever saw it was
[1:03:01] the sweetest that any brother mothers
[1:03:03] face that evident I saw and he said and
[1:03:06] this one said father put all of Daniel
[1:03:11] Curry's account over on mine he said for
[1:03:15] a while Daniel Currie was on earth he
[1:03:17] stood for me and now in heaven I'll
[1:03:21] stand for Daniel curry you understand me
[1:03:25] he was a judge he was a jury he was the
[1:03:28] attorney and he stood there y'all
[1:03:30] understand me what I'm trying to say is
[1:03:33] the only way we make it right now is
[1:03:36] because Jesus the Advocate is standing
[1:03:39] on our behalf hallelujah he's our
[1:03:42] comforter
[1:03:43] that's what coffee
[1:03:44] us to know that we cannot be lost
[1:03:47] cuz Jesus Christ has never lost the case
[1:03:52] he has never lost a case he never will
[1:03:55] lose a case hallelujah because it
[1:03:58] doesn't matter if the accuser is that
[1:04:00] right the Bible said what with no weapon
[1:04:03] formed against you shall prosper none
[1:04:06] not even those who can accuse you and
[1:04:09] say I saw him I saw her do this in any
[1:04:13] other and God said but it's dismissed
[1:04:16] because I took upon their sins I'm the
[1:04:19] one put it all on me
[1:04:21] I conquered death hell and the grave for
[1:04:23] them hallelujah thank you Jesus for the
[1:04:30] grace of God whoo yeah what he says
[1:04:37] Jesus Christ the grace of God pleaded
[1:04:41] for me you didn't deserve it I don't
[1:04:45] deserve it
[1:04:45] but that's our comforter the Holy Ghost
[1:04:50] oh I don't know whether y'all get it but
[1:04:53] it just did it ages oh it accepts me on
[1:04:56] fire to know that I have someone like
[1:04:59] Jesus Christ a perfect judge you know
[1:05:02] you can go to court and you can find a
[1:05:03] judge you don't know whether he's gonna
[1:05:05] win the case or not but in this case you
[1:05:09] know that the judge that you got who was
[1:05:12] Jesus Christ he's gonna win your case
[1:05:16] hallelujah he's your attorney right
[1:05:18] that's what I meant the attorney that
[1:05:20] you hire you don't know whether he can
[1:05:22] do it but this attorney has already
[1:05:26] settled the case hallelujah he has
[1:05:29] settled it so much he went all the way
[1:05:31] back to the Garden of Eden traced it all
[1:05:34] the way back and said you didn't mean
[1:05:37] the sin in the first place you were
[1:05:40] tricked into it oh is that right listen
[1:05:44] what he says he's about in this case the
[1:05:47] judge himself becomes our attorney God
[1:05:50] became man
[1:05:50] there was no attorney could do it we
[1:05:53] couldn't find one Moses and the law the
[1:05:56] prophets nothing could do it
[1:05:58] so the judge becomes the jewett both
[1:05:59] judge becomes both jury attorney and
[1:06:03] judge himself and took the justice of
[1:06:05] the law in his own hand pay the price of
[1:06:09] it himself
[1:06:10] how much more secure could we be and
[1:06:13] sinners all right back upon us as a
[1:06:16] witness that he has accepted it how
[1:06:19] safely can it be when God gives you the
[1:06:22] Holy Ghost you are heaven bound there is
[1:06:25] no demon in Hell there is no trap the
[1:06:28] delicate set before you that God will
[1:06:31] account against you because at the end
[1:06:34] of the day you're perfect because he
[1:06:38] made you perfect you like that
[1:06:45] I got about one more scripture
[1:07:00] god is so good to us
[1:07:09] so that we understand we're living in
[1:07:10] such a horrible time second
[1:07:13] Thessalonians 2 3 through 7 it says that
[1:07:17] you're not that ye be not soon shaken in
[1:07:19] mind or be troubled neither by spirit
[1:07:22] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[1:07:26] that day of Christ is at hand let no man
[1:07:30] deceive you by any means but that day
[1:07:32] shall not come except there come a
[1:07:34] falling away first and that excusing
[1:07:38] that man of sin be revealed the son of
[1:07:40] perdition who opposeth exalt himself
[1:07:43] above all that is called God or that is
[1:07:46] worshipped so that he as God sitteth in
[1:07:50] the temple of God showing himself that
[1:07:52] He is God remember ye not that when I
[1:07:55] was with you was yet with you I told you
[1:07:58] these things and now you know with hope
[1:08:00] not
[1:08:01] and now you know what withholdeth that
[1:08:04] he might be revealed in his time so you
[1:08:07] can understand Paul goes on and say this
[1:08:10] is the mystery of iniquity
[1:08:13] the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:08:15] work only he who now letteth will let
[1:08:19] until he be taken out of the way
[1:08:22] that means the mystery of iniquity is
[1:08:25] going to work it's going to even
[1:08:27] continue to work after the rapture is
[1:08:29] taking place you understand me and this
[1:08:33] mystery of iniquity will work will well
[1:08:36] how can I say it : 8 into a capping of a
[1:08:43] Antichrist this Antichrist will be known
[1:08:47] as the devil the serpent the Beast
[1:08:51] hallelujah and we know it's a one-man
[1:08:55] show at the end of the day like God it
[1:08:58] was a one-man at the end of the day
[1:09:00] Satan would be a one-man and what people
[1:09:02] don't understand he will rule he will
[1:09:07] rule the entire earth and everybody who
[1:09:10] does not have the mark of God will have
[1:09:13] the mark of the beast there's no other
[1:09:16] way you either get the Holy Ghost or you
[1:09:18] get the mark of the beast you
[1:09:22] I'm saying so what are you saying when
[1:09:25] you get the seal of the Holy Ghost you
[1:09:27] can never be affected by the mark of the
[1:09:30] beast because it's a seal it cannot be
[1:09:35] broken and that that seal is not broken
[1:09:38] until you reach your destiny y'all
[1:09:41] understand me that's what people don't
[1:09:43] understand so let me let me give you
[1:09:45] this before I close I may use Hitler
[1:09:50] Ford example his Hitler was not the
[1:09:55] Antichrist but he was an antichrist
[1:09:58] Hitler was a man but he was inspired by
[1:10:04] the devils of the Euphrates when the
[1:10:07] demons come out of the Euphrates when
[1:10:09] you Freddy's was open according to
[1:10:11] revelation they came upon the earth and
[1:10:14] they inspired Hitler Mussolini and
[1:10:18] Stalin the chief demon of that pact was
[1:10:23] Hitler now
[1:10:26] Hitler to me was one of the greatest
[1:10:28] preachers I had ever seen
[1:10:30] never no dude I don't know German but
[1:10:34] I've heard him preach charismatic I mean
[1:10:39] there was no preacher yeah I ever heard
[1:10:41] you ever seen him preach oh my he put
[1:10:46] some of these preachers stuff to shame
[1:10:49] you know make me want to know what is he
[1:10:51] saying in that German but what I'm
[1:10:54] trying to say is that every man of God
[1:10:58] is a minister and you are ministering
[1:11:01] something sometimes people think oh he's
[1:11:04] just PR every word has a spirit and
[1:11:09] preachers are ministering spirits they
[1:11:12] are the ministers in which spirits were
[1:11:15] releasing something help better hear
[1:11:17] what I'm saying that's what people don't
[1:11:19] understand every preacher will minister
[1:11:23] something that's why president said we
[1:11:25] need to lay in the presence of God
[1:11:26] ministers ought to give before God make
[1:11:28] sure they in the spirit of God so when
[1:11:30] they get to preach it
[1:11:31] they are ministering the Spirit of God
[1:11:34] that's what happened
[1:11:36] when they preached a little Peter began
[1:11:39] to preach in canoes in many house what
[1:11:42] happened he was ministering the Holy
[1:11:44] Ghost and the Holy Ghost fell why
[1:11:47] because that that was the fire that was
[1:11:49] the life coming out of him
[1:11:51] and here was Hitler ministering demons
[1:11:55] Oh folks
[1:11:57] he was the Avenue in which Satan came in
[1:12:02] upon the people and all those people was
[1:12:05] who yeah I heard lot there was actually
[1:12:09] be anointed with the demons of the
[1:12:11] Euphrates demons of the ant eluvian day
[1:12:15] they didn't even know it they just
[1:12:19] thought he was a politician somebody
[1:12:22] help me here but those spirits overtook
[1:12:26] them and whatever the hare demon say do
[1:12:29] they did it because they themselves were
[1:12:34] being controlled by Devils you
[1:12:37] understand me so let me break it down
[1:12:39] and bring it back to you this is what
[1:12:42] the Holy Ghost is doing in our day he is
[1:12:44] anointing the people of God with his
[1:12:47] spirit by the preaching of the word they
[1:12:55] are bein ordered by the Holy Ghost and
[1:12:58] the Holy Ghost is now affecting their
[1:13:02] lives
[1:13:03] hallelujah changing them so whatever the
[1:13:06] words say they'll do it
[1:13:09] hallelujah but at the end day there was
[1:13:12] two brides there is a bride of Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ and there's the bride of Satan
[1:13:17] and the bride of Jesus Christ would take
[1:13:20] on his spirit will be in Christ and they
[1:13:25] will be into Satan o people of God I'm
[1:13:30] trying to tell you something this is not
[1:13:32] just it ain't just a wedding or the
[1:13:34] wedding of God's bride it is the wedding
[1:13:37] of Saint his bride they will also crown
[1:13:40] him like we are crime in Jesus y'all
[1:13:47] better hit mean I'm talking about
[1:13:49] folks charge people no it can't be in
[1:13:54] here so who did kill Jesus church folks
[1:13:58] undaunted with the same spirit Judas was
[1:14:02] anointed with it is the truth
[1:14:08] see with no two spirit rod you got to
[1:14:11] understand they're at war they're at war
[1:14:14] and these two are coming to a climax now
[1:14:18] Jesus against the Antichrist or Christ
[1:14:21] against the Antichrist how he want to
[1:14:23] put it but they're at war and at the end
[1:14:27] of the day before the devil constant
[1:14:29] destroy the bride of Jesus he'll take us
[1:14:32] away hallelujah for three and a half
[1:14:35] years we're being ISM in his presence oh
[1:14:38] but when we come back hallelujah we come
[1:14:42] back with Jesus riding on a white horse
[1:14:44] and we'll be following him on white
[1:14:46] horses and what we're coming to do
[1:14:49] conquer and guess what Jesus conquer by
[1:14:54] the sword out of his mouth see it goes
[1:14:56] back to the mouth it goes back to what's
[1:15:00] in you hallelujah
[1:15:03] death and life is within the tongue
[1:15:06] right the Bible says God is not in
[1:15:09] heaven he's in you he's not even in your
[1:15:12] mouth this is where God must be in you
[1:15:16] so he can come out of your mouth has to
[1:15:22] be that way and everybody that's why the
[1:15:24] Christian is becoming amen they the
[1:15:27] people that people hate the most you can
[1:15:30] be as perverted as all you get out or
[1:15:33] get out and the world will accept you
[1:15:35] but when you are real Christian the
[1:15:38] world hates you why they are being
[1:15:41] anointed by their husband who is the
[1:15:45] devil himself it's gotten to the place
[1:15:48] that people don't even know they're in
[1:15:50] church worshipping the devil thinking
[1:15:53] it's Jesus
[1:15:54] because the Bible says amen the Savior
[1:15:57] will come as an angel of light he would
[1:16:00] disguise himself as
[1:16:02] truth and the people will worship him in
[1:16:05] the charges because they refuse the
[1:16:07] truth of their day God gave them over to
[1:16:10] a strong delusion that they would be a
[1:16:12] believer lie and be condemned by God
[1:16:15] cannot be worship in the Trinity not the
[1:16:19] true God not the way they bring it out
[1:16:22] he cannot be and that's the thing
[1:16:26] hallelujah
[1:16:27] you said brother are you crazy let me
[1:16:29] say it like this if the people who
[1:16:32] believe that God is one who will be
[1:16:34] persecuted by the people who believe
[1:16:36] that God is three it was there in the
[1:16:41] earlier days it's gonna be that way in
[1:16:44] the evening time it is what it is
[1:16:47] because Satan travels in Trinity you
[1:16:53] love the Lord I'm trying to tell you
[1:16:55] something it is because your election
[1:16:58] you is not because you're smart is your
[1:17:00] election that brings you out of this mmm
[1:17:04] it because God chose you to bring you
[1:17:07] out of this that's why we ought to be
[1:17:10] whispering eternity thinking God for
[1:17:12] what he did in this spirit this moment
[1:17:16] eternity think at him because no man was
[1:17:20] worthy oh lord have mercy I can't even
[1:17:22] get across like I see it but I'm trying
[1:17:25] to tell you the grace of God it's just
[1:17:26] because like I said no man goes to hell
[1:17:28] because of wicked things we do we go to
[1:17:30] hell because we refuse to pardoning
[1:17:32] blood of Jesus Christ we at we fail to
[1:17:35] take the part and God has died for us
[1:17:38] and we we said well you know I'd rather
[1:17:40] do something else
[1:17:41] see that's what send people are hell not
[1:17:43] because of you being you are in the
[1:17:45] flesh that is bad you're gonna make
[1:17:47] mistakes you're gonna do things that's
[1:17:50] not right but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:52] is your advocate it stand for you
[1:17:55] hallelujah that's why Jesus came the
[1:17:57] Bible said we we have not a high priest
[1:18:00] that cannot be touched by the feeling of
[1:18:01] our infirmities why he suffered in every
[1:18:04] point that is why he wanted to know what
[1:18:07] you were going through and now that he's
[1:18:09] the judge jury and attorney he says Lord
[1:18:12] they didn't know what they were doing
[1:18:13] because you know what none of us can not
[1:18:16] compete with Satan's intelligence only
[1:18:21] the Holy Spirit can give us grace to
[1:18:23] escape him because no man is smarter
[1:18:27] Daniel was smart but he wasn't that
[1:18:29] smart
[1:18:30] you understand me you love the Lord
[1:18:33] that's why we ought to trust God for
[1:18:35] everything at the end of the day we're
[1:18:38] gonna need it you love the Lord
[1:18:41] ah let's stand I'm not finished I'm
[1:18:45] finished for tonight
[1:18:46] but I want I want us to really see what
[1:18:49] Jesus Christ has done for us he's done
[1:18:52] something that right now we may not even
[1:18:54] be able to to to to fathom it
[1:18:59] you know we and God didn't say you have
[1:19:01] to understand everything but you gotta
[1:19:03] believe it you know this is the only
[1:19:07] book that tells you where you come from
[1:19:08] and where you're going right and
[1:19:12] everybody else can have they all got all
[1:19:14] god of books I went to India and I've
[1:19:16] seen all kind of religion and people for
[1:19:18] the atticus ISM but at the end of the
[1:19:21] day only Jesus Christ can give a man
[1:19:22] peace religion will never give you peace
[1:19:26] it's that you got to seek God and you
[1:19:29] ain't got a shout you ain't got it is
[1:19:30] like I said run up and down the aisles
[1:19:32] that ain't necessary what you need to
