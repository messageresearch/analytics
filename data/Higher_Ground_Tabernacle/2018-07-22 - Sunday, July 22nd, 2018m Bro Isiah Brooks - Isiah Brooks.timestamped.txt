[36:07] praise him according to his excellent
[36:10] greatness praise him with the sound of
[36:14] the trumpet praise him with the psaltery
[36:16] and harp praise him with the timbrel and
[36:20] dance praise him with the string
[36:22] instruments and organ praise him upon
[36:26] the loud cymbals praise him upon the
[36:29] high sounding cymbals that everything
[36:33] that had been done
[36:36] Matthew 15
[36:45] fifteen we thank God for our new carpet
[36:48] right God has a way matthew 15:8 through
[37:03] nine this people draweth nigh unto me
[37:09] with their mouth and honor me with their
[37:13] lips but their heart is far from me but
[37:19] in vain they do worship Me teaching for
[37:23] doctrines the commandments of men one
[37:29] more scripture st. John for we're going
[37:34] to try to take our time this morning
[37:38] because we we have few visitors and
[37:44] friends we want by God's grace for them
[37:48] to understand what is being said this
[37:52] morning st. John 4 beginning at the 21st
[38:02] verse
[38:14] then Jesus said unto her woman believe
[38:18] me the hour cometh when ye shall neither
[38:23] in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[38:28] worship the father ye worship ye know
[38:33] not what we know what we worship for
[38:37] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[38:44] cometh and now is when the true
[38:47] worshipers shall worship the father in
[38:50] spirit and in truth for the father
[38:54] seeketh such to worship Him God is a
[38:59] spirit and they that worship Him must
[39:02] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[39:06] let us pray our Heavenly Father we thank
[39:11] you for your grace and your mercy we
[39:14] thank you for being so good to us
[39:17] you have been better to us than we have
[39:20] been to ourselves
[39:22] forgive us Lord of everything you
[39:25] forgive us for every thought and desire
[39:28] that have not been pleasing in thy sight
[39:31] cleanse us Lord and wash us this morning
[39:34] from all darkness Lord look and search
[39:40] even as the psalmist said it there
[39:42] thought you find anything in me that
[39:45] shouldn't be take it out of us Lord
[39:48] because we realize Lord Jesus that we
[39:51] are predestinated
[39:53] to the adoption of sons and daughters
[39:56] and Lord we're pressing our way we're
[40:00] moving forward so that your word would
[40:03] be made manifest in us grant it here
[40:06] this morning each and every heart in
[40:09] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[40:12] you may be seated so don't worry about
[40:18] disturbing anyone rather just so they
[40:20] can hear all right I
[40:26] wanted to minister this morning on the
[40:28] thought the only way to worship the only
[40:35] way to worship there's only one way to
[40:37] worship we have many facets of
[40:43] worshiping we're in that you have a lot
[40:47] of organizations denominations and and
[40:51] even those who are centered around what
[40:54] we call the message first of all what is
[41:01] worshiping what is praise as we read in
[41:05] Psalms 150 everybody and everything can
[41:10] praise God but not everything in
[41:15] everybody can worship God worship has
[41:20] been defined and narrowed down to one
[41:25] thing when Jesus was talking to the
[41:29] woman at the well most of us know the
[41:33] story she had five husbands and the one
[41:37] that she was with was not her own and as
[41:42] I said amen
[41:43] last week the world looked at us in a
[41:49] different way than which God looks at us
[41:52] when that woman came to the well the
[41:56] world may have looked upon her as being
[41:58] a prostitute but when Jesus saw her she
[42:04] was a daughter of Zion and the
[42:09] conversation went on and she said this
[42:14] woman said to Jesus don't you know that
[42:18] it's not lawful it's not right for you
[42:22] to ask me for drink because we have a
[42:29] segregation between the Jews and the
[42:31] Samaritans and according to their law
[42:35] you're not to even have a word with me
[42:40] and then Jesus said woman go get me a
[42:42] drink and you know how the word the
[42:44] story goes but then Jesus comes and she
[42:48] he begins to discern her thoughts and
[42:50] her intent and then jesus said to her
[42:56] woman if you drink of this water in
[43:02] which I'm going to give you you'll never
[43:06] thirst again see that that that's what
[43:08] gets me that God is the true thirst
[43:12] quencher and we realised by God's grace
[43:19] they went on to say talk they talked
[43:23] about worship and the Samaritan woman
[43:28] was talking about how they worship and
[43:30] they worship in these mountains and
[43:33] whatever the case may be but then Jesus
[43:37] said unto her basically your worship is
[43:41] in vain you don't even know what you're
[43:45] worshiping but the Jews they know they
[43:52] have a true revelation of who they are
[43:55] worshiping and then Jesus said one day
[44:00] all of this will be done away with it
[44:03] won't be that you're worshiping a
[44:05] mountain a worship in Jerusalem a
[44:09] worship in DesMoines there is coming a
[44:12] time that the worship place will be
[44:15] changed and they that worship Me must
[44:21] worship me in spirit and in truth when
[44:27] we think about worship we think about
[44:31] paying respect to God a sacred personage
[44:40] it's it means more to me and you who
[44:44] that then just praise anybody could say
[44:48] thank you Jesus
[44:51] but you see
[44:52] that could be just a praise but worship
[44:56] comes from a deep place in the heart it
[45:02] is a gratitude that only that individual
[45:07] experience and everybody can't worship
[45:14] when we think about how Israel was set
[45:19] up and how they had the outer Court they
[45:24] had the inter court and they had what we
[45:28] call the Holies of Holies we have a
[45:33] picture out there in the vestibule
[45:35] of how Israel camped around the Ark of
[45:40] the Covenant
[45:41] you see you can praise God and worship
[45:46] Him a praise God on the outer court but
[45:50] the outer court had no sheltering place
[45:53] if it rained you got wet if the Sun was
[45:59] shining us you got Heat and that's how
[46:04] Christians are they still in the outer
[46:07] Court they out there where that they
[46:12] they are swayed by the weather if it's
[46:18] cold outside they're cold
[46:20] if it's raining outside they're saying
[46:23] if it's sunshine they might be happy but
[46:28] it was the atmosphere that change their
[46:31] way of praise now in the inner court
[46:35] you had the seven golden candlesticks
[46:39] which represented the seven messengers
[46:42] of the seven ages but even so those
[46:47] candlesticks had a way of going out
[46:51] waxing loofa that's why in Matthew 25
[46:55] Jesus says trim your lamps get all of
[47:01] the wax
[47:02] get all of the things in your life
[47:04] that's good
[47:06] in you or hindering your life for
[47:08] shining from shining move it out of the
[47:12] way trim it because in that holy place
[47:16] you heard me a sanctified place a holy
[47:20] place hallelujah
[47:22] those candlesticks could still go out
[47:25] and when the candle speak goes out
[47:29] Peter said at that time you have
[47:32] forgotten that you've been purged you
[47:36] have been you have forgotten that God
[47:38] has sanctified you and you have
[47:41] forgotten and you can't even see your
[47:43] way that's what happens to Christians
[47:46] when they're still in the inner court
[47:50] it's a good place to be but you have
[47:55] another place that you must enter into
[47:57] and we call that the Holies of Holies
[48:01] hallelujah and the property I said we
[48:04] need to not only enter into that holy
[48:06] place but we need to shut the veil close
[48:10] that veil amen and never come out again
[48:14] that is the bedroom of God if I could
[48:17] say it like that those who enter into
[48:22] that Holies of Holies they are able to
[48:26] worship God in spirit and in truth
[48:29] see but you say well what Brotherhood's
[48:32] I got truth but you still can't worship
[48:36] God according to his perfect plan until
[48:40] you get spirit but you say brother once
[48:43] I got spirit but I don't have truth
[48:46] you're still not a true worshipper is
[48:50] that right
[48:51] he said the true worshipers will worship
[48:54] me in spirit and in truth you're not a
[48:58] true worshiper until you enter into the
[49:01] veil Alleluia you should all brother
[49:06] Brijesh worship is adoring Jesus but you
[49:12] got to realize hey man a lot of people
[49:14] can praise Him and praise is a form of
[49:18] worship but it's
[49:20] not the intense worship it is not the
[49:22] worship that God wants to bring us into
[49:25] you see that's why Amen our our
[49:30] so-called worship can become ritualistic
[49:34] it can become follow and when it becomes
[49:38] formal that means you have an incident
[49:41] to the veil because once you enter into
[49:44] the veil it's no longer you worshipping
[49:47] but it's God in you worshipping when you
[49:51] get to the place and you don't want to
[49:53] come to church you're not in that veil
[49:55] like you ought to be when it feels when
[49:58] you feel like you you just don't want to
[50:00] pray you're not in that veil hallelujah
[50:02] when you're not reading your Bible
[50:05] you're not you haven't gone beyond the
[50:07] veil hallelujah amen
[50:09] behind that veil we're talking about the
[50:12] Shekinah glory of God but we're just not
[50:15] talking about a baptism of the Holy
[50:18] Ghost we're talking about being
[50:20] completely filled amen in secured sealed
[50:23] up hallelujah amen where the devil can
[50:26] him get in a crack the Bible said that
[50:30] was the problem with Israel they had
[50:33] they were able to praise him but they
[50:37] didn't have their heart they didn't have
[50:38] the heartfelt religion it wasn't they
[50:42] hadn't gone in not they hadn't they
[50:43] hadn't really they weren't really
[50:45] serving God you know it outwardly they
[50:47] were serving him and inwardly they were
[50:50] void is that right it's true Jesus told
[50:56] it those Pharisees he says it was good
[50:58] that I come because outwardly you look
[51:03] like white it's up like are you you give
[51:05] you beautiful outside but inside your
[51:09] dead men's bones you see what I'm saying
[51:13] now true worship you got people
[51:17] everywhere that really believe that
[51:19] they're worshipping God and the Bible
[51:22] said they're worshiping in vain there
[51:25] are in reality a many Christians who
[51:30] thought they were heaven bound and when
[51:32] they die
[51:33] instead of us sending they descended he
[51:38] said I oh brother what are you saying
[51:39] let's take for an example the rich
[51:42] yellow Rula whom Jesus invited to come
[51:45] with him and when Jesus invited that
[51:49] rich young ruler he literally were
[51:51] asking him to to come and preach be a
[51:54] minister preach for me but the rich
[51:57] young ruler and then he had so much
[52:00] wealth and he had a real a machinery of
[52:04] the business going on and he thought no
[52:08] I can't give up everything you want me
[52:10] to give up everything and follow you
[52:15] remember Jesus had nothing the Bible
[52:20] says foxes have holes birds have nests
[52:24] but the Son of man has no place to lay
[52:27] as him so here was a man dressed in a
[52:31] par garment he wasn't dressed like the
[52:38] rich folks of that day and he's looking
[52:41] at this wealthy wealthy wealthy rich
[52:45] young ruler and say come follow me no
[52:52] doubt in his eyes he was looking at the
[52:57] physical shape of Jesus and looking at
[53:00] the wealth that he had and the fine
[53:03] clothes in which he wore and thought
[53:06] within himself how can I give up all of
[53:09] this I've spent my whole life so uh so I
[53:15] could come to this place where I won't
[53:18] need anything and he turned from the
[53:23] Lord Jesus and said this is too hard for
[53:26] me to do I can't give up everything I've
[53:31] worked so hard for to follow you and
[53:34] then Jesus flipped to another page and
[53:38] the rich young ruler is now wealthy he's
[53:41] old he's ready to retire and he says to
[53:46] himself
[53:47] a man see he thought you know he thought
[53:48] he was a worshipper because he asked
[53:52] Jesus he said listen when he was young
[53:54] he said what must I do to inherit
[53:55] eternal life and Jesus says sell all
[54:00] that you have and follow me and Jesus
[54:06] questioned him he says listen I've done
[54:08] all I've kept the commandments I rest on
[54:12] the Sabbath pot I've done all of these
[54:14] sacrifices that I need to do I've been
[54:16] done everything but one thing he did not
[54:20] do he did not give God his heart he
[54:25] worship he did it practically formerly
[54:30] instructively but he still didn't have
[54:33] God in his heart he was legalistic he
[54:38] was starchy he was formal and he did not
[54:41] have God in his heart and so when God
[54:44] not on his own the door of his heart his
[54:47] heart could not respond yes because God
[54:50] was not in his heart
[54:51] now he's an old man and he's got all of
[54:56] this wealth and he's saying to his soul
[55:00] oh my soul you've done well in business
[55:06] you've done good in the stock market now
[55:11] look at you you got all of this riches
[55:15] and now it's time for you to retire but
[55:20] he had no idea that God had a card
[55:25] saying this day is the last day for the
[55:31] rich young ruler to live hallelujah and
[55:35] God allowed death to come and pull that
[55:38] car and when this man died hallelujah
[55:43] instead of going to heaven he went to
[55:45] hell
[55:47] listen and the thing about it people
[55:50] said when you're dead you're done no sir
[55:52] when you leave this place you are not
[55:55] done you're not in some comatose how
[55:59] lujah but you are in a place that's just
[56:01] as real if not more real than this place
[56:05] and that rich young ruler a man looked
[56:09] and all of a sudden he saw someone that
[56:12] he knew on earth y'all know the story
[56:15] when Lazarus a men were begging a
[56:18] warning bread from him stable Lazarus
[56:21] was a Christian hallelujah and you know
[56:24] how rich people are sometime when you a
[56:26] Christian they feel like you wasting
[56:27] your life hallelujah but Nazareth wasn't
[56:32] concerned about his life on earth he was
[56:34] concerned about the life he was going to
[56:36] go to you understand me this life here
[56:40] is temporal young people this life is
[56:43] temporal elders this life is temple the
[56:47] little of us that this life is temporal
[56:50] you're not going to stay here forever
[56:52] one day you're going to die hallelujah
[56:56] don't be concerned about the riches here
[56:59] be concerned about the riches bad the
[57:03] bible says set your affection on things
[57:05] above hallelujah not on this earth
[57:09] because this is going to perish and
[57:12] everything in it and that right Oh
[57:17] hallelujah see it doesn't matter who you
[57:20] are what you are if you are gene seed of
[57:23] God is that right God who will quicken
[57:27] 18 so a true worshiper must worship God
[57:33] in spirit and in truth and in spirit
[57:36] it's the Holy Ghost
[57:37] right you know I must understand by
[57:42] God's grace that God in the days of Noah
[57:47] sent nor nor was the doorway for you
[57:54] turn a life is that right
[57:57] he was the doorway and everybody that
[58:00] didn't listen to Noah no matter how
[58:02] foolish it sound they perish even if
[58:08] had their only boats even if they had
[58:12] their own organization in the nomination
[58:14] look Noah was the voice of that age yeah
[58:18] I understand me and so we go on you said
[58:21] what do you mean no one could have said
[58:23] except you hear this preaching you go to
[58:27] parish with everything else is that
[58:29] right just like Moses Moses was the
[58:33] voice of God
[58:35] you had Pharaoh you had the Egyptians
[58:38] you had all kinds of idol worshippers in
[58:41] each other but Moses was the one man
[58:45] that knew God Moses meant God on the
[58:49] backside of the desert Moses met God in
[58:53] the place that we're in that God stepped
[58:56] out of the bush and into Moses and then
[58:58] Moses walked down to Egypt a man with a
[59:03] rod in his hand saying I have come to
[59:06] conquer Egypt and foolish as it sounds
[59:10] hallelujah it is the truth that one man
[59:14] all the through the greatest nation on
[59:18] earth
[59:19] because at that time because his
[59:22] leadership because of his worship
[59:25] hallelujah and you see you can't worship
[59:27] God the way you want to when God when
[59:31] Moses met God
[59:32] the first thing God told Moses take up
[59:36] your shoe the ground that you're
[59:39] standing on is holy ground
[59:41] you understand me so God will instruct
[59:45] you on how to worship you can't worship
[59:49] God by offering him things that pertains
[59:51] to Buddha uh Allah you understand me
[59:54] it must be pure it must be clean and it
[59:58] must be simple let no man according
[1:00:02] Ephesians 5 and I'm coming back to that
[1:00:04] thought let no man deceive you with vain
[1:00:08] words but because of these things cometh
[1:00:11] the wrath of God upon the children of
[1:00:13] disobedience be naughty therefore
[1:00:17] partakers with them for ye were
[1:00:20] sometimes darkness but
[1:00:22] now are ye light in the Lord walk as
[1:00:25] children of the light for the fruit of
[1:00:29] the Spirit is in all goodness and
[1:00:31] righteousness and truth so you what are
[1:00:34] you saying brother Brooks you know the
[1:00:36] fruit of the Spirit is all righteousness
[1:00:40] and goodness I remember I said it's the
[1:00:43] Word of God said you can't be two kinds
[1:00:45] of trees at one time you can't be like
[1:00:48] the serpent was good and evil you got to
[1:00:52] be either good or you got to be evil
[1:00:54] hallelujah you know you can't be oh I'm
[1:00:57] almost no you're not almost there is no
[1:01:01] in-between there is no purgatory
[1:01:04] hallelujah if there were a purgatory
[1:01:07] this is it
[1:01:08] hallelujah because when you leave here
[1:01:11] you either going up or you going down is
[1:01:14] that right now hi I'm going to get in
[1:01:18] here you said I said this the other day
[1:01:19] and I said all the time because I'm
[1:01:22] sorry I'm gonna look fast for you I'm
[1:01:24] sorry I said all the time
[1:01:27] you were born into this world before you
[1:01:31] came into this world you lived in your
[1:01:33] mother's world right that world got too
[1:01:37] small for you and you are predestinated
[1:01:40] to enter in business to this world now
[1:01:44] this is not the end of it you have
[1:01:47] another world we call it heaven and this
[1:01:52] well amen nothing but the righteous
[1:01:55] nothing but the Holy nothing but the
[1:01:58] clean all that pertains to God is there
[1:02:03] hallelujah and the only way that's what
[1:02:06] Jesus said be holy for my father which
[1:02:09] is in heaven is holy you a Lord how can
[1:02:13] I get holy gee there's no holy mountain
[1:02:16] there's no holy water there is no holy
[1:02:19] man the only way that thing that makes
[1:02:23] you holy if there is a holy God on the
[1:02:25] mountain if there's a holy God in the
[1:02:28] man if there is whole a holy God in the
[1:02:31] water then the water is holy he said why
[1:02:35] absolutely this god of mine this god of
[1:02:38] yours is axel he's able to even make the
[1:02:43] dark holy is that right he said to Moses
[1:02:46] this ground you standing on is holy
[1:02:50] ground
[1:02:50] Oh glory to God y'all don't have to say
[1:02:53] Amen but I'm telling you you and I must
[1:02:57] understand amen knowing this message is
[1:03:00] good knowing that God sent a prophet is
[1:03:03] good but that won't get you into heaven
[1:03:07] hallelujah
[1:03:08] many of those in that day who knew Moses
[1:03:12] was sent as a prophet perished in the
[1:03:15] wilderness hallelujah because they
[1:03:18] failed to worship God in spirit and in
[1:03:21] truth
[1:03:23] hallelujah knowing that God sent Jesus
[1:03:26] Christ means nothing the devil believed
[1:03:30] that Jesus is the Son of God hallelujah
[1:03:33] and there is no redemption for him
[1:03:36] hallelujah oh just to say I take Jesus
[1:03:40] as my savior it's not good enough
[1:03:42] there's a time justification was
[1:03:45] suitable hallelujah and God's accepted
[1:03:49] that during the time of Luther remember
[1:03:52] God moved on up to sanctification
[1:03:55] hallelujah and Wesley came that was
[1:03:58] acceptable is that right
[1:04:00] amen now just being sanctified wasn't
[1:04:03] enough hallelujah
[1:04:04] and I justified wasn't enough death not
[1:04:06] not being sanctified is enough you got
[1:04:09] to be born again
[1:04:12] somebody help me is that right Oh people
[1:04:17] so all if you just you know God is love
[1:04:19] and if you just just take God you know
[1:04:22] you can just do what you want to do go
[1:04:24] where you want to go act like you want
[1:04:26] to go do as long as you just confess the
[1:04:30] Lord Jesus Christ in your heart you
[1:04:33] shall be safe that's the beginning it
[1:04:38] don't it doesn't stop there that is the
[1:04:41] beginning right and look even though
[1:04:46] whoo-hooo rebelled against the true
[1:04:49] in which Moses brought was lost what you
[1:04:55] mean to tell me that they overcame the
[1:05:00] death angel by putting blood on the
[1:05:03] doorpost and the little escape the Death
[1:05:06] Angel they marched through the Red Sea
[1:05:11] baptized unto Moses millions baptized
[1:05:15] unto Moses hallelujah
[1:05:18] yummy yes and then when they got out
[1:05:23] into the wilderness they thought they'd
[1:05:26] do their own thing
[1:05:27] oh did they shout hallelujah Mirian got
[1:05:30] that tambourine and they began to play
[1:05:31] and they had a glorious time hallelujah
[1:05:36] but the same ones who had the blood on
[1:05:39] the doorpost in a little the same ones
[1:05:41] that were baptized a minute of the Red
[1:05:44] Sea the same ones that women shouted on
[1:05:47] the red sea shore died spiritually in
[1:05:51] the wilderness I this Christian walk is
[1:05:58] a journey y'all hit me it's like a baby
[1:06:03] being born that Christian must mature
[1:06:06] into a grown man he must become a word

[1:06:28] ears and just to stimulate our brains

[1:06:40] thing to Moses Oh Moses where did this
[1:06:44] man come from that's deep Oh Moses I
[1:06:47] love coming Oh whether those fowls come
[1:06:51] from that's deep that didn't say them

[1:10:35] can kill you whatever and then Jesus
[1:10:38] said you can't do nothing and everything
[1:10:41] that you're doing is what my father has
[1:10:44] allowed you to do now I'm coming to some
[1:10:47] things in just a minute I'm taking my
[1:10:48] time you and I are not just creatures of
[1:10:57] time we are creatures of eternity that
[1:11:04] that
[1:11:05] I was somewhere before I got here is
[1:11:08] that right and you were somewhere before
[1:11:12] you got here sometimes we experience
[1:11:16] these things what we call deja vu and
[1:11:21] deja vu really is a manifestation of you
[1:11:28] where you've traveled somewhere in your
[1:11:31] dream because you know every time you
[1:11:34] dream you travel that shows that you
[1:11:39] just not all body your spirit too and
[1:11:43] you come to some places you said oh seem
[1:11:46] like this place is so for me I've been
[1:11:48] here before it's because in your dreams
[1:11:51] because the Bible said God orders man by
[1:11:54] the way of his dreams God draws it out
[1:11:58] place it in your dream it's like it's
[1:12:01] like uploading a computer he puts it in
[1:12:05] you and you you follow that dream don't
[1:12:07] even know why you're doing what you're
[1:12:08] doing but God has already uploaded you
[1:12:10] now you said well what do you mean
[1:12:13] brother Brooks listen whenever you see a
[1:12:15] DejaVu I love those things I loved it
[1:12:17] when I happened cuz sometimes I can tell
[1:12:20] you what's getting ready to happen now
[1:12:23] that's not every time a time
[1:12:25] okay I know this is getting really hot
[1:12:26] you know but you don't tell people there
[1:12:28] cuz they thank you crazy but at the same
[1:12:31] time it makes me feel good because I
[1:12:33] know I'm in the will of God when those
[1:12:37] things happen amen
[1:12:39] listen because God have from the
[1:12:43] beginning chosen you and I that we hear
[1:12:47] that often time but you'll never know
[1:12:49] what I'm talking about until you get the
[1:12:50] Holy Ghost until you get a real call in
[1:12:54] your life you'll never know what
[1:12:55] predestination is you'll never
[1:12:57] understand how God chose you I just
[1:13:00] really don't understand that why other
[1:13:02] than I was a part of him that's all I
[1:13:05] know
[1:13:05] and I realized by God's grace that God
[1:13:08] placed me in such an evil age and my
[1:13:13] duty in this evil age is to preach
[1:13:16] righteousness holiness
[1:13:18] is that right it's you know to preach
[1:13:21] amen the message of the our word God is
[1:13:24] already delivered unto us that's my duty
[1:13:26] I'm just a man
[1:13:28] blowing the trumpet or resounding what
[1:13:31] has already been said that all right
[1:13:37] why because I'm living in a time where
[1:13:41] there is a mystery of iniquity now Paul
[1:13:44] talks about that mystery of iniquity and
[1:13:46] said that his work is it's working in it
[1:13:49] going to always work what is it it's the
[1:13:51] devil's religion Satan has has
[1:13:55] copycatted or he is mimicking
[1:13:59] Christianity is that right
[1:14:03] even the message he's got people that
[1:14:07] can jump and shout at every divine
[1:14:10] revelation but they can't live it
[1:14:14] that's not spirit and truth you got to
[1:14:19] live this thing it ain't in your head
[1:14:21] it's supposed to be in your heart is
[1:14:24] that right it ain't about knowing all
[1:14:26] the mysteries the greatest mystery that
[1:14:29] you ought to know is Christ in you when
[1:14:33] you know that he's bad
[1:14:35] amen like a stone nobody can move you
[1:14:38] hallelujah you understand me
[1:14:41] when the Holy Ghost is in you you can
[1:14:44] worship God you don't have to worry
[1:14:46] about how high you jump hallelujah
[1:14:48] because you've already reached heaven
[1:14:50] and you can jump as high as you want to
[1:14:53] right you and I must realize that we're
[1:15:02] not playing games with the devil Satan
[1:15:07] is the wickedest thing that could ever
[1:15:11] exist
[1:15:11] and he has an agenda and he's got you on
[1:15:17] his agenda he will offer you pleasure I
[1:15:23] heard brother
[1:15:24] do Co on Friday night down in Iowa City
[1:15:29] I thought what he said was so
[1:15:33] wonderfully profound he said when God
[1:15:39] allowed the serpent to deceive the
[1:15:44] serpent worked with her hearing she
[1:15:51] meant us we allow ourselves to be
[1:15:55] deceived by what we see our eyes become
[1:15:59] our greatest enemy especially when it
[1:16:02] become when it comes to a woman but when
[1:16:06] it comes to a woman she wants to hear
[1:16:08] those good sweet things
[1:16:11] she won't her husband to say all those
[1:16:14] nice things to make her feel good he how
[1:16:18] no it's true
[1:16:21] hallelujah
[1:16:23] but a man don't need all that he just
[1:16:26] loved what he see is that right and
[1:16:29] that's the way it is now
[1:16:32] a lot of preachers will seduce the
[1:16:35] church by the way they say things is
[1:16:40] that right but you got to realize that
[1:16:44] we didn't come to just speak sweet
[1:16:46] things we came to preach that that kind
[1:16:50] of a message that will cause people to
[1:16:52] repent people who to be convicted about
[1:16:58] their sins
[1:16:59] we don't preach a word Amen that's gonna
[1:17:03] cause some people to look at me inside
[1:17:05] of them and see that they need help we
[1:17:09] all need help is that right I can't say
[1:17:16] this enough thank you what we where are
[1:17:19] we
[1:17:21] we're at a time that Satan can give you
[1:17:24] a strong delusion a Bible the Bible
[1:17:29] calling 2nd Thessalonians said because
[1:17:32] they did not have a love for the truth
[1:17:35] is that right oh I'm just gonna wear
[1:17:38] what I want to I'm gonna do what I wanna
[1:17:39] do I'm gonna go where I want to go I
[1:17:40] don't care what the message said this is
[1:17:42] the way I feel this is what I want to do
[1:17:44] I don't care what
[1:17:46] they were I'm gonna go where I want to
[1:17:48] go I'm gonna do what I want to do I'm
[1:17:53] gonna look at what I want to look at
[1:17:56] that right I don't care what brother
[1:18:00] Brooks preaches Alleluia one thing for
[1:18:08] sure this man has no desire to control
[1:18:14] you I don't have a controlling bone in
[1:18:20] my body and if I could control you what
[1:18:25] good will it do you because at the end
[1:18:30] of the day you'll still be lost
[1:18:32] you understand me this is an individual
[1:18:36] of faith even though we come together as
[1:18:40] a church it's still an individual affair
[1:18:45] is that right you've got to know Jesus
[1:18:48] Christ for yourself
[1:18:52] hallelujah so let me move on there is
[1:18:55] only one spirit and that spirit is God
[1:18:57] and the Spirit of God is what the spirit
[1:19:01] of truth you didn't you didn't evolve
[1:19:03] you didn't come here on a spaceship you
[1:19:06] know what I mean you understand me you
[1:19:09] came by way of generations right you
[1:19:14] came by way of Adam and Eve and Adam and
[1:19:18] Eve came by way of God when you said let
[1:19:21] there be is that right so you and I must
[1:19:25] know that whatsoever we do whatsoever we
[1:19:29] ask in the name of Jesus Christ he'll do
[1:19:33] it you said I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:19:35] if you want the Holy Ghost God to give
[1:19:38] you the Holy Ghost but you got to
[1:19:40] surrender everything right is that that
[1:19:44] that's simple I'm trying to be simple
[1:19:49] when a woman gets married and she she's
[1:19:53] got that veil on her head what's she
[1:19:56] saying to that man
[1:19:58] I'm
[1:19:59] rendering I'm submitting when we came to
[1:20:03] Christ he bailed us right with his Holy
[1:20:08] Spirit and you and I are saying Lord
[1:20:10] Jesus you are the head of my life
[1:20:13] somebody said well you know she's the
[1:20:16] neck and you the head and she can just
[1:20:18] turn you wherever you want to go but
[1:20:22] some things about that neck and I don't
[1:20:24] mean to be funny that neck can get stiff
[1:20:32] that neck can experience pain you ever
[1:20:34] heard experience pain in the neck so you
[1:20:38] understand ain't nothing glorious about
[1:20:40] the neck your neck Kate thing it's their
[1:20:44] head that thinks right so you and I must
[1:20:48] understand whenever the neck gets
[1:20:50] involved and leaves the head out of it
[1:20:53] then what happens that head began to
[1:20:56] look in places he shouldn't look because
[1:20:59] the neck is turning it right so you and
[1:21:04] I must understand by God's grace amen
[1:21:06] that when you unite with one another
[1:21:09] amen you are uniting in a way amen that
[1:21:12] she is in her place and he is in her
[1:21:14] place I don't care what the world is
[1:21:16] saying God has a Laura and whenever the
[1:21:24] woman moves out of her place her
[1:21:25] marriage becomes perverted and whenever
[1:21:27] the man moves out of his place the
[1:21:29] marriage becomes perverted hello spirit
[1:21:36] and truth
[1:21:38] you know how they tell they say no ain't
[1:21:41] no man gonna tell me what to do well if
[1:21:46] you want to get to heaven now I ain't
[1:21:48] talking about a man who's abusive in
[1:21:50] town telling his wife to do crazy stuff
[1:21:52] I'm talking about a love relationship
[1:21:55] hello that's the way a marriage is
[1:21:58] supposed to be it's supposed to be a
[1:21:59] love relationship where the woman
[1:22:02] wilfully gives and the man willfully
[1:22:04] gives and he supplies the needs
[1:22:06] hallelujah that's truth you say well
[1:22:10] what do you mean that is the
[1:22:12] relationship that God
[1:22:13] between Jesus Christ in His Church it's
[1:22:16] a love relationship she stays faithful
[1:22:19] to him he stays faithful to her is that
[1:22:21] right listen let me hurry up let me
[1:22:25] hurry up I'm taking too much time
[1:22:26] amen coming from the message to see
[1:22:29] Jesus you said I am so happy tonight
[1:22:31] that Jesus has not forsaken the people
[1:22:34] in this great day that we're living
[1:22:36] under this great strain that we are
[1:22:40] under today yet our Lord has not left us
[1:22:44] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:22:48] pray the father and he would give you
[1:22:50] another comforter which is the Holy
[1:22:53] Spirit and he will abide with you
[1:22:56] forever even the Spirit of Truth who the
[1:23:00] world cannot receive I am very thankful
[1:23:04] that the Spirit of Truth was to be with
[1:23:07] us to the end this and that Spirit of
[1:23:12] Truth is one other but the Lord Jesus
[1:23:15] Christ you know why it's so important to
[1:23:18] have the Holy Spirit because a preacher
[1:23:21] or anyone can get up before you and can
[1:23:24] say anything and it can sound so close
[1:23:28] so right hallelujah and without the Holy
[1:23:32] Ghost you will not be able to discern
[1:23:35] whether it's wrong right
[1:23:37] I have seen people shout and dance in
[1:23:42] the spirit of words that were erroneous
[1:23:47] but the Holy Ghost even if you don't
[1:23:50] know all of this Bible all you've got to
[1:23:53] do is hear somebody preach something
[1:23:54] wrong and the Holy Ghost will check you
[1:23:57] something's wrong here right see the
[1:24:02] only way to worship God is spirit and
[1:24:04] truth you said well let me come I'm
[1:24:06] gonna come to my point in just a moment
[1:24:07] so see we're thankful that the Spirit of
[1:24:12] God is with us today is that right
[1:24:14] amen and you know he said a little while
[1:24:17] the world won't see me but you will see
[1:24:20] me how many of us have a relationship
[1:24:23] with God that we see him
[1:24:27] hello do you see God do you see him see
[1:24:35] it all depends on what you're looking at
[1:24:36] I see God in you I see God in me I see
[1:24:43] God every day I see God when I wake up
[1:24:46] in the morning why I didn't wake myself
[1:24:49] he woke me many people wish they would
[1:24:52] wake up and they still did not they'll
[1:24:54] never wake up again not into this realm
[1:24:58] I see God when he blesses me when I pray
[1:25:02] and he answers prayer I know that's God
[1:25:05] hallelujah it's no coincidence it's not
[1:25:09] something that just happened hallelujah
[1:25:13] oh oh oh the world said well that's just
[1:25:15] coincidence it's no coincidence that
[1:25:17] wasn't just by chance like I told you
[1:25:21] all the other day I said when I saw that
[1:25:23] ego down there at the park it flew by me
[1:25:26] like that and looked at my face when
[1:25:27] I've been down there just not long ago
[1:25:29] and I'm walking and Here Come another
[1:25:32] eagle a young eagle that's it's not
[1:25:33] fully developed away it he does the same
[1:25:36] thing he fires right by me closely and
[1:25:39] then he looks at me
[1:25:41] Who am I I don't know I'm not trying to
[1:25:44] be nobody but somehow there's something
[1:25:47] to that and I don't understand it yet
[1:25:49] but anyway the eagle looks at me and
[1:25:52] then flies back up to the nest maybe
[1:25:54] because I always said they were mine I
[1:25:57] don't know but one thing I do know with
[1:26:01] it whether I have a sign or anything I
[1:26:04] know I'm a son of God now what are the
[1:26:11] chances that's what the devil say you
[1:26:12] know that's just chance you know that's
[1:26:13] just coincident that
[1:26:15] that ego did that I'm saying uh-uh no no
[1:26:18] no there's no coincidence somebody told
[1:26:21] that ego to do what he did that was Anna
[1:26:24] normal behavior of those two Eagles is
[1:26:27] that Alright now you said all brother
[1:26:30] Brooks yeah that's just coincidence well
[1:26:33] what happens when you pray and you have
[1:26:34] a need and all of a sudden somebody
[1:26:37] knocks on your door and give you what
[1:26:38] you need is that a coincidence
[1:26:43] hmmm spirit and in truth how can you
[1:26:46] worship God if you don't see his acts is
[1:26:49] that what the Bible says I read it 150
[1:26:52] I'm gonna praise him in his acts I must
[1:26:55] see him act I must see him do hallelujah
[1:26:58] amen in every leadership every moment of
[1:27:01] my life
[1:27:02] and may God leaves me and he ought to
[1:27:05] lead you you you need to see God I see
[1:27:09] him in the wind I see him in the way I
[1:27:11] see him in the atmosphere I see him
[1:27:13] everywhere what happens when you almost
[1:27:16] get in a wreck now I'm off my thought
[1:27:18] but when you see that Satan is trying to
[1:27:21] kill you and God stops him do you raise
[1:27:24] your hand and praise and worship oh you
[1:27:26] just say Oh Lord thank you you need to
[1:27:28] stop pull on the side of the road and

[1:29:26] gonna live you don't have no fun fun is

[1:30:07] devil said to Jesus catch yourself down
[1:30:10] from this mountain you know and when

[1:30:17] fun it's true it's gonna be a little bit
[1:30:23] of fun so oh no but you don't understand
[1:30:26] it it is written if you catch yourself
[1:30:29] down Amen the angels gonna bear you up
[1:30:33] see the devil to take the same scripture
[1:30:37] I've seen it happen I haven't seen the
[1:30:39] person but when I was in South Carolina
[1:30:42] Amen this man they had put it all on the
[1:30:44] news because the Bible says if your eye
[1:30:46] of Flint fin you pluck it out in this
[1:30:49] man pluck this eye out that wasn't the
[1:30:53] Holy Ghost that's not even what the Holy
[1:30:56] Ghost is speaking of he's speaking about
[1:30:59] people in the church amen that's going
[1:31:01] to be disorderly people in the church
[1:31:03] that's not gonna live a holy and
[1:31:05] righteous life that's causing problem
[1:31:07] in the truck pluck it out I don't care
[1:31:09] mr. preacher pluck it out I don't care
[1:31:11] then Deacon pluck it out I don't care if
[1:31:13] the ELSA pluck it out get rid of it
[1:31:16] I don't care be your right arm get rid
[1:31:19] of it why it's better to enter into the
[1:31:22] kingdom main you said well what do you
[1:31:28] mean brother books let me say it like
[1:31:29] this you don't see no fancy car here it
[1:31:31] would be nice to have one we don't have
[1:31:33] no great musicians it would be nice to
[1:31:35] have some hallelujah but that's not what
[1:31:38] makes us live we live off the bread we
[1:31:41] live off the Word of God we live off of
[1:31:44] truth is that okay listen let me let me
[1:31:49] I'm trying to hurry folks now Mike my
[1:31:51] thought is you know how Jesus the Holy
[1:31:57] Spirit how do you know the true Holy
[1:31:59] Ghost the true Holy Ghost the Bible said
[1:32:02] is the spirit of prophecy Jesus Christ
[1:32:06] is the true spirit of prophecy amen that
[1:32:11] it that's in the book of Revelation 19
[1:32:14] so prophecy is is that thing that is
[1:32:17] foretelling or predicting of something
[1:32:19] to take place they have never been
[1:32:24] another leader in our day that has been
[1:32:26] so great I mean come on Jesus Christ
[1:32:31] Himself told us exactly what we're gonna
[1:32:33] live what kind of day we were gonna live
[1:32:35] in has he missed it
[1:32:37] hallelujah then the then God sent
[1:32:40] Malachi for probably God for our our day
[1:32:42] and he began to tell us exactly the way
[1:32:45] it was going to be he told us what the
[1:32:47] church was going to be like he told us I
[1:32:49] mean the way people were going to be he
[1:32:51] told us amen how that only a few be that
[1:32:53] say that right he told us that the way
[1:32:55] would be so narrow it would be like the
[1:32:58] day of Enoch when one man would be safe
[1:33:00] we look at Nora
[1:33:02] Noah and Noah had it was 888 that saved
[1:33:06] and just think if it was eight million
[1:33:07] that means one out of a million made
[1:33:09] that made that made salvation and now
[1:33:12] we've got all these churches all over
[1:33:13] the world amen call themselves
[1:33:16] Christians and evil is on the rampant
[1:33:19] right
[1:33:21] I mean we look at these things and now
[1:33:23] you said what Brotherhood's worth much
[1:33:24] money you can't do it you can't live
[1:33:26] life you can't live righteous you can't
[1:33:29] you cannot live holy you can not do it
[1:33:33] but I have a solution to the problem you
[1:33:36] must be born again
[1:33:37] people your religion ain't gonna do it
[1:33:40] and knowing everything the Prophet said
[1:33:42] and everything else it ain't gonna save
[1:33:44] you until that which was said it's
[1:33:47] living in you
[1:33:48] it must live in you is this okay I'm
[1:33:54] about to cut it short I mean not sure I
[1:33:55] won't go long enough but I'm pleading
[1:33:58] this morning I'm pleading with everybody
[1:34:01] young and oh and a lot of time you know
[1:34:03] we just don't pay the attention to the
[1:34:06] word like we ought to because you know
[1:34:08] we just think we've got it made you do
[1:34:10] not have it made until you cross the
[1:34:14] line of that veil until you go into the
[1:34:16] Shekinah glory you said what I want to
[1:34:18] be saved then I believe that any one of
[1:34:20] us who have named the name of Jesus
[1:34:22] Christ in this place is saved but
[1:34:26] salvation just having salvation won't
[1:34:29] get you in the rapture yet right the
[1:34:35] foolish virgins had salvation that's
[1:34:38] what made them virgins but the only
[1:34:40] thing that's going to give you a true
[1:34:44] rapture experience is the Holy Ghost
[1:34:47] being sealed with the Holy Ghost and I
[1:34:50] had that in mind my thoughts even as
[1:34:53] Peter said add to your faith virtue
[1:34:55] knowledge temperance you and I and this
[1:34:58] must must mature in the into the full
[1:35:01] statue of Christ people are not
[1:35:05] preaching it here people you know think
[1:35:08] that they so deep into everything but
[1:35:11] they're not concerned about the souls of
[1:35:13] men and I'm concerned about our souls
[1:35:17] because you see how you are reflection
[1:35:22] let's put it this way you are a
[1:35:24] reflection and wherever your soul is
[1:35:28] wherever your spirit is you are
[1:35:30] reflecting that if it's locked up in
[1:35:33] prison somewhere if
[1:35:35] locked up by habits and in all kinds of
[1:35:37] damnable things you are reflecting that
[1:35:40] if you are in heaven or heavenly places
[1:35:43] that the scripture we are now setting in
[1:35:46] heavenly places in Christ Jesus if you
[1:35:48] are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:35:50] you are reflecting that you are a
[1:35:54] reflector of where you are is that right
[1:35:58] oh you take a drug at it you don't know
[1:36:01] what his name but he's got a demon of
[1:36:03] drugs on it right and if he's doing
[1:36:06] drugs guess what he is reflecting his
[1:36:09] body is reflecting his movements is
[1:36:11] reflecting his actions are reflecting
[1:36:14] amen what he is you know he doesn't have
[1:36:17] to say a word to you an alcoholic when
[1:36:20] he is it's full of that demon and then
[1:36:24] he he's reflecting it you don't have to
[1:36:28] say are you an alcoholic ah that demon
[1:36:31] you're gonna not only see it you're
[1:36:33] gonna smell him right and that's the way
[1:36:38] it is with the Christian he doesn't have
[1:36:41] to open his mouth what is in here will
[1:36:44] reflect if it's heaven in him you're
[1:36:47] gonna feel the atmosphere you're gonna
[1:36:49] know the atmosphere you're gonna know
[1:36:51] that he's different from somebody else
[1:36:53] amen who claim to be a Christian
[1:36:55] hallelujah come on somebody but you look
[1:36:59] at a person a man you can't command God
[1:37:02] Oh Lord I want the Holy Ghost now you
[1:37:06] don't get the Holy Ghost now you don't
[1:37:09] accept God he accepts you and you ought
[1:37:12] to be grateful enough that he's calling
[1:37:14] you you don't get frustrated with the Oh
[1:37:17] see that's the way it is with women when
[1:37:19] they get when they're having a baby you
[1:37:20] know they get frustrated I want to have
[1:37:22] this baby now though you got two more
[1:37:24] months three more months but you gonna
[1:37:32] have it you feel the life you know he's
[1:37:35] in there he's kicking you every now and
[1:37:38] again don't you worry your birthday is
[1:37:41] coming if there is a thirst in your
[1:37:44] heart for God God said if a man hunger
[1:37:47] and thirst for righteousness
[1:37:48] he shall be filled hallelujah
[1:37:52] there is no no one will ever get before
[1:37:55] God says well Lord you didn't tell me or
[1:37:58] you didn't show me Lord you'll never be
[1:38:00] able to blame your condition on God
[1:38:02] because God has done everything the
[1:38:05] greatest thing that the Lord has given
[1:38:07] you a since his son or himself Jesus
[1:38:09] Christ God sent the prophet in this day
[1:38:13] that brought us a word that separates us
[1:38:15] from all the organizations and
[1:38:16] denominations and we're still not
[1:38:18] satisfied with it
[1:38:20] hallelujah is that right some of us we
[1:38:23] can sit among and sit down and watch a
[1:38:25] movie for three to four hours and never
[1:38:26] complain just reach over get your pop or
[1:38:29] get over your soda or your popcorn and
[1:38:30] just keep moving moving moving moving
[1:38:32] but when it comes to the Church of God
[1:38:34] listen some of us won't even get up to
[1:38:36] go to the restroom but when it comes to
[1:38:38] God we're running in and out of that
[1:38:40] running in and out of here out of here
[1:38:42] like it's nothing it shows that you have
[1:38:45] not crossed over it shows that your you
[1:38:49] are reflecting see because I tell you
[1:38:51] what if Jesus was here which is if you
[1:38:55] could really see him I wonder how many
[1:38:56] of us would get bored with him
[1:38:58] huh because if you get bored with him
[1:39:01] now
[1:39:02] you'll be bored with him there that
[1:39:03] proves if you don't change if something
[1:39:05] in your heart don't change you will not
[1:39:08] be there you love the Lord i'ma finish
[1:39:16] this message this evening because I
[1:39:19] think it's vital I think I think knowing
[1:39:22] I didn't say a lot of things because I
[1:39:27] realized one thing for certain if you
[1:39:29] don't let the Holy Ghost occupy you your
[1:39:31] heart your spirit if you don't let God
[1:39:33] come in guess what you are a vessel you
[1:39:37] are a house all right think about it
[1:39:41] when a man dies what comes in worms
[1:39:47] something's gonna occupy some
[1:39:49] something's gonna eat you away all right
[1:39:52] and so my point is if you don't get the
[1:39:55] Holy Ghost you're gonna get the unholy
[1:39:57] Ghost the Holy Ghost comes in one person
[1:40:00] right and that's Jesus Christ himself
[1:40:03] but the devil he comes in the spirit of
[1:40:06] lust lust of the eye lust of the flesh
[1:40:10] and the pride of life and those three
[1:40:13] demons have so many other demons with
[1:40:15] them do you know that the devil don't
[1:40:18] travel by himself he comes in a game as
[1:40:22] Legion he'll tell you about it see you
[1:40:26] must understand that if you if you turn
[1:40:28] from Christ you're going to get worse
[1:40:32] and what we're trying to do by the grace
[1:40:35] of God is to make this thing a reality
[1:40:38] having here knowledge of this thing is
[1:40:41] not going to take you over you must be
[1:40:44] born again
[1:40:45] not only born again but you've got to
[1:40:47] mature
[1:40:48] God is coming the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:40:51] coming for a mature bride a person who's
[1:40:56] got virtue faith virtue knowledge
[1:40:58] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:41:00] kindness and divine love will crown you
[1:41:04] that's what makes a rapture now
[1:41:07] understand me it can't be oh and you
[1:41:10] said what brother Brooks I I need you
[1:41:12] know how could I say you won't true and
[1:41:28] you won't spirit because you won't
[1:41:30] spirit in truth that's the only way to
[1:41:31] worship God and it's not by practicing
[1:41:37] it a cow don't practice to give milk a
[1:41:44] dog don't practice the bark you a dog
[1:41:51] don't practice the bar
[1:41:56] a chicken doesn't practiced it lay eggs
[1:42:03] it comes with the C whatever it is is
[1:42:08] what it is and when you are a Christian
[1:42:13] and you are truly born again you don't
[1:42:17] have to practice to love somebody you
[1:42:25] don't practice to like somebody you full
[1:42:31] along you love you everybody see what
[1:42:38] I'm saying you don't have to practice oh
[1:42:40] because they did good to me I'm gonna do
[1:42:42] good to them
[1:42:43] no I'm gonna do good to them cuz that's
[1:42:46] what I want to do that's what I'm doing
[1:42:49] y'all love the Lord let's stand let that
[1:43:01] will be done if you can keep that in
[1:43:03] your heart in mind let your will be done
[1:43:07] in earth as it is in heaven
[1:43:11] so everything I'm going to do my desire
[1:43:16] Lord everyday is to do what I know you
[1:43:19] do a would do in heaven though I live
[1:43:24] here y'all remember the story that the
[1:43:29] prophet of God Brabham told told about
[1:43:33] this in isn't a true story this lady was
[1:43:35] a Pentecostal lady and she was base
[1:43:44] cleve Pentecostal I believe a very
[1:43:47] religious lady and she believe in just
[1:43:52] listening to her pastor even though
[1:43:54] truth was given to her she rejected it
[1:43:57] and at the end of the day she was
[1:44:00] screaming because she saw where she was
[1:44:03] heading and she called her pastor uh a
[1:44:12] deceiver she said and I'm gone to hell
[1:44:19] because of you you deceive her and they
[1:44:24] they basically hushed up I may have two
[1:44:27] stories come mixed in but I'm gonna get
[1:44:29] to the point I'm not interested in
[1:44:33] teaching anyone how to live here I'm not
[1:44:39] preparing you for here I'm not a man
[1:44:42] that's gonna tell you about all you can
[1:44:44] make all these millions I'm not
[1:44:48] interested in that
[1:44:48] it's your souls it's all right you learn
[1:44:53] you'll learn how to live here but I'm
[1:44:57] trying to teach you how to live here so
[1:45:00] you can live there that's the most
[1:45:05] important thing young and all are dying
[1:45:07] but I wanted women when I take my last
[1:45:10] breath I want to make sure I got my
[1:45:12] ticket in my hand and I'm going up
[1:45:15] instead of going down and I believe that
[1:45:19] with all my heart I I don't I don't Tom
[1:45:23] tried to confuse the grace of God I know
[1:45:28] it's not by worked but one thing for
[1:45:31] certain when you get truly filled with
[1:45:34] the Holy Ghost your life is no longer
[1:45:39] works your life is your life that make
[1:45:42] sense when I wake up in the
[1:45:48] do what I do that's my life I don't have
[1:45:54] to practice putting on my pants or
[1:45:56] practice putting on my shirt it's what I
[1:45:58] do I know how to do that that's how it
[1:46:01] becomes the Holy Ghost becomes so
[1:46:04] indwelling in dwelt in you to all you're
[1:46:08] doing is what he does that's your goal
[1:46:11] all right people don't settle for
[1:46:13] religion I don't care how many years
[1:46:16] you've been in this message or been
[1:46:17] around it do not sell them for religion
[1:46:20] that's not what it's can't calm a
[1:46:23] godsend Isaac to get him a bride god al
[1:46:27] easy to get Isaac a bride and that's
[1:46:29] what we are and a bride must be without
[1:46:31] spot wrinkle or blemish and only the
