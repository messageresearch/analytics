[39:08] God is good to us
[39:14] girdled up thy loans like a man
[39:19] for I will demand of thee an answer
[39:24] and answered thou me
[39:28] where was thou when I laid the
[39:30] foundation of the earth
[39:33] declare it dealer if thou Hast

[40:12] things in Jesus Christ
[40:16] amen amen amen you may be seated that's
[40:19] why
[40:22] hallelujah hallelujah we'd like to
[40:25] entitle this message
[40:27] the revelation of perfection
[40:32] oftentimes we have been taught
[40:36] that our Perfection come by human
[40:38] efforts
[40:41] and by the way of the law yeah
[40:45] for hundreds of years they tried to
[40:48] perfect
[40:55] capable of perfecting
[40:58] the only person who can perfect us
[41:03] is Jesus Christ himself
[41:07] and this is why the blood
[41:10] of Jesus Christ was shared
[41:15] not only for the remission of sins
[41:20] but it was shared to present to present
[41:25] us
[41:30] Perfection only comes
[41:33] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[41:36] and by the blood of Jesus Christ
[41:39] he was a man by the name of job
[41:43] that God literally bragged on him
[41:48] even said unto Satan
[41:51] have you considered my servant
[41:56] so when God calls you perfect
[42:00] you are perfect
[42:02] but we must understand
[42:05] job's perfection foreign

[43:34] killed he's at the tree but we find out
[43:37] that job never lost one because
[43:41] Hallelujah when God began to restore
[43:46] He restored job in such a mighty way
[43:52] and when it came to his children
[43:55] brother Brandon said it like this
[43:58] have you noticed God did not multiply
[44:03] Joe's children
[44:05] but God gave Joe
[45:05] you know Hallelujah here God says to Joe

[45:20] will demand
[45:22] where was thou when I laid the
[45:26] foundation of the earth
[45:28] declare it if thou Hast understand
[45:33] that morning star the seventh verse the
[45:36] verses when the morning

[1:11:59] throughout the entire world
[1:12:01] has been a fear say in prayer they are
[1:12:06] always afraid
[1:12:09] and when a little sickness strikes

[1:21:05] to come back and adopt us into the
[1:21:09] family of music
[1:21:11] and now we are children of God
[1:21:15] the life from them
[1:21:20] he said the life from the blood
[1:21:25] the life
[1:21:28] now let me read this quote now
[1:21:30] we're going to the next part
[1:21:34] coming from entombment
[1:21:36] paragraph 60. he said the law having a
[1:21:40] shadow
[1:21:45] a normal he said oh when I think of that
[1:21:48] the law having a shout out
[1:21:51] normal the shoes he said look what the
[1:21:54] law offered
[1:21:56] why won't you really meditate on this
[1:21:58] meditate on what I'm saying
[1:22:01] look what the law offered
[1:22:05] turn over to the next chapter
[1:22:07] the 11th chapter of Hebrew
[1:22:11] he said look what Daniel done under the
[1:22:14] law
[1:22:16] look what he not done under the law okay
[1:22:20] look what Moses done under the law
[1:22:23] then if he was only living in the shadow
[1:22:27] of the atonement what
[1:22:32] ought the Christian Church do today
[1:22:37] with the reality of the resurrection of
[1:22:41] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:43] uh
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:23:03] be sure to bring the best place

[1:23:17] the soldiers
[1:23:21] when the walls of the enemy comes
[1:23:24] throw up your Shield go out and meet him
[1:23:28] he didn't say run from him he said go
[1:23:32] out and meet him
[1:23:40] did not give you the Armor
[1:23:44] he gave you the army so you could fight
[1:23:48] resistance

[1:24:47] will take it from you you know so let
[1:24:50] the devil come take it
[1:24:54] back partly well it must be the Lord's
[1:24:56] way
[1:24:58] if you didn't ask him
[1:25:01] how do you know if you didn't confront
[1:25:05] God about it
[1:25:07] the Bible says in all of your ways
[1:25:11] acknowledge Him He will direct your path
[1:25:23] did you
[1:25:26] first
[1:25:28] we we allow the devil to do things to us
[1:25:31] without inquiring of the Lord
[1:25:36] hallelujah hallelujah and then while we
[1:25:38] suffering
[1:25:41] because we did not acknowledge

[1:25:56] Hallelujah
[1:25:58] God help us Lord is this okay and the
[1:26:02] wise of the enemy comes in through him
[1:26:07] now if the law could produce that I
[1:26:09] don't see that
[1:26:11] the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:19] the resurrection resurrection
[1:26:23] and spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ will
[1:26:30] now we ought to come to church
[1:26:33] with the highest of reverence we
[1:26:37] ought to the end of the church like real
[1:26:40] saints of God
[1:26:42] walk over them
[1:26:44] and take our position
[1:26:47] and keep our minds on Christ we

[2:14:59] on the face of the Earth
[2:15:02] it's greater than Noah's message
[2:15:06] it's greater than all the messages that

[2:15:49] him
[2:15:51] brag about anything that we've done this

[2:16:43] and all that he has
[2:16:45] done and he is doing for us
[2:16:49] as the prophet of God says there is no
[2:16:53] greater time to live for Jesus
[2:16:57] then this time and I Pray by God's grace
[2:17:01] that he would give us all the mercy and
