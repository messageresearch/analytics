[1:18] Ecclesiastes one Genesis 6
[1:23] verse
[1:26] uh let's just start at verse one oh my
[1:31] I'm laughing because before we got here
[1:33] quoted the
[1:35] scripture hey I love Vindication amen
[1:39] hallelujah you see I think sometimes
[1:40] people understand as ministers you
[1:42] always want the mind of God but you're
[1:45] always looking for Lord am I in the
[1:46] right Chan Lord is this what you want me
[1:49] to speak and right before we turn in the
[1:52] parking lot he quoted the
[1:53] scripture amen
[1:56] hallelujah amen he say and verse verse 1
[2:00] 6 And1 Genesis 6 And1 and it came to
[2:03] pass when men began to multiply on the
[2:05] face of the earth and the daughters and
[2:09] the daughters were born unto them that
[2:11] the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[2:15] that they were fair and they took them
[2:18] wives of all which they chose and the
[2:22] Lord said my spirit shall not always
[2:24] strive with man for that he shall for
[2:28] that he also is flesh yet his days shall
[2:33] be a 120 years there were giants in the
[2:38] earth in those days and also after that
[2:41] were the sons of God came in unto the
[2:44] daughters of men and they bear children
[2:46] to them the same became Mighty Men which
[2:49] were of old men of renown and God saw
[2:54] that the wickedness of man was great in
[2:56] the earth and that every imagination of
[2:59] the thought of his heart was only evil
[3:03] continual and it repenteth the Lord that
[3:06] he had made man on the earth and it
[3:08] grieved him at his heart and the Lord
[3:11] said I will destroy a man whom I have
[3:13] created from the face of the Earth both
[3:16] man and Beast and the creeping things
[3:18] and the fouls of the air for it
[3:20] repenteth me that I made them but Noah
[3:25] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen
[3:29] Ecclesiastes
[3:34] one
[3:35] uh let's start at verse
[3:39] 8 Ecclesiastes 1
[3:42] and8 All Things Are full of Labor man
[3:46] cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied
[3:50] with sin nor the ear full with hearing
[3:54] the things that have been it is that
[3:57] which shall be and and that which is
[4:01] done is that which shall be done and
[4:04] there is no new thing under the sun is
[4:07] there anything whereof it may be said
[4:10] see this is new it have been already of
[4:13] old time which was before us there is no
[4:17] remembrance of former things neither
[4:20] shall there be any remembrance of things
[4:22] that are to come with those that shall
[4:26] come after may the Lord bless the
[4:28] reading of his word you can have your
[4:30] seats
[4:32] today
[4:35] amen my subject by God's grace tonight
[4:39] is finding your place in
[4:41] history finding your place in history
[4:46] but if I can I want to I want to deal
[4:49] with when history repeats itself amen
[4:53] you know some history is good some
[4:56] history is bad amen but I believe us as
[4:59] Believers we got to find our place in
[5:03] what we want to be remembered for amen
[5:06] uh uh not as a person but the spirit
[5:09] behind our lives amen be because behind
[5:12] everything is a spirit amen whether it's
[5:15] good or whether it's bad there's a
[5:17] spirit behind it and there's also some
[5:19] history behind that Spirit Hallelujah
[5:22] now the reason why I read uh uh uh The
[5:25] Book of Ecclesiastes because Solomon
[5:28] Solomon uh uh he said that there's
[5:31] nothing new Under the Sun amen all the
[5:34] things that we're seeing now they've
[5:36] already came Hallelujah and if I can
[5:38] talk I'm going to talk kind of natural
[5:40] some things that we see upon the face of
[5:43] the Earth that have already been here
[5:45] you know if I can talk to the young
[5:47] people you know uh they have styles of
[5:49] uh it's kind of faded out now but
[5:51] different styles ush in you know they
[5:53] they brought back the afro and the
[5:55] cornrows but if you go back into the
[5:57] family album you'll see Mom and Daddy
[6:00] with cornrows and afro Hallelujah that
[6:03] was already was and that same Spirit
[6:06] came back up again hallu you know what
[6:09] it was it was fashion trying to stay
[6:12] relevant amen see so it was a spirit
[6:14] behind it and you look uhh uh uh even in
[6:18] my day Hallelujah we wore uh certain
[6:20] hairstyles what we call a crew cut or a
[6:23] box and you see those very things are
[6:26] coming back now and church what I'm
[6:28] saying is we see a lot of things
[6:31] repeating itself but normally uh uh when
[6:34] you look at at things repeating itself
[6:37] you got to wash the spirit behind it
[6:40] because one thing about Satan Hallelujah
[6:42] Satan cannot create so a lot of times he
[6:46] bring up things that were once popular
[6:48] Hallelujah and he does it all over but
[6:51] one thing I want to show you when it
[6:53] comes to Satan that Spirit becomes more
[6:56] and more
[6:58] wicked more and more evil amen as it
[7:02] repeats it becomes more and more evil
[7:04] you know brother brandom talked about a
[7:06] woman named Sarah B amen and he said
[7:08] that she was a flapper amen her mama was
[7:11] a flapper because her Grandmama was a
[7:13] flapper so he say the only thing the
[7:15] daughter could be would be what her mama
[7:17] and her Grandmama was see history
[7:20] repeated itself now that was the name he
[7:23] called out and as that Spirit moved on
[7:26] that Spirit fell on Marilyn Monroe
[7:28] Hallelujah Same Spirit different vessel
[7:31] but it got more wicked amen see Sarah Bo
[7:34] she was one of the first women who
[7:36] started the natural strip
[7:40] teas started a strip brother Ram say it
[7:43] was a strip teas and it was silent film
[7:46] then she it was just playing a little
[7:48] music and she it wasn't even wasn't even
[7:50] no music it was just a a film where she
[7:53] would go behind a curtain throw her
[7:55] clothes off and the men would be
[7:56] standing there
[7:59] no words coming out of their mouth just
[8:01] a facial expression it was a solid
[8:06] lust it was a silent strip teas but you
[8:10] know as that Spirit moved on it got even
[8:13] more and more wicked from Sarah from
[8:16] sarbo to Mel Monroe Hallelujah it got
[8:20] even more wicked and as the spirit moved
[8:22] on and history repeated itself it fell
[8:25] on
[8:26] Madonna yes
[8:28] sir and got even more even Wicked she
[8:31] started singing songs Like a
[8:34] Virgin oh my can I preach
[8:39] tonight but what was happening church
[8:42] history was repeating itself but it was
[8:45] a spirit of evil Hallelujah and as it
[8:49] came on you notice the Bible said the
[8:51] reason why I read Genesis 6 he said in
[8:53] man's heart was evil
[8:56] continually the more man progressed the
[8:59] more wicked he got the further he got
[9:02] away from
[9:04] God oh my why because history was
[9:07] repeating itself H the prophet of God
[9:10] say he said that he said that God takes
[9:13] the man and leaves the spirit he said
[9:16] Satan does the same thing he'll take the
[9:18] man and leave the spirit amen and you
[9:20] know if I could if I could go down into
[9:23] on the male side now well you might say
[9:26] well uh uh brother digs uh what's so
[9:29] wicked today I call his name out and
[9:31] some of these people I don't know I have
[9:34] no problem with but one thing I know I
[9:37] know a spirit when I see it Hallelujah
[9:39] in church if I call the name out of
[9:41] Justin Bieber
[9:44] Hallelujah I don't know the young man
[9:47] very talented but I've seen that Spirit
[9:49] on him
[9:51] before history is repeating itself why
[9:55] you young people may may may may may may
[9:57] look at that and you may crazy you may
[10:00] be craving the wrong thing that happened
[10:02] years before and some of you adults you
[10:05] may not even know who that is but you've
[10:07] also seen that spirit before it was on a
[10:10] man named
[10:12] Elvis who was a young man had more money
[10:15] than he could control but he was
[10:17] literally losing his mind just like
[10:19] Justin
[10:21] Bieber Hallelujah you say Brother D he
[10:24] had he's a young man he's 19 years old
[10:26] and he has $100 million so was El
[10:31] see The Cadillacs the prophet called his
[10:34] name so the bride is calling a successor
[10:36] to that ministry's name cuz it's the
[10:39] same spirit and even in between there
[10:42] between Elvis and Justin baver you had
[10:45] that spirit that got even more wicked
[10:46] than Michael
[10:52] Jackson you say why is he talking about
[10:55] all these
[10:56] people I'm talking about history I'm
[10:59] talking about the spirit that's
[11:00] following
[11:01] Mankind and you have to know where you
[11:04] want to be identified you have to know
[11:08] what's trailing you what's in your
[11:10] bloodline Hall what's in your family
[11:12] tree amen because history really you
[11:15] know you you can be in a God-fearing
[11:17] family and still have evil in your blood
[11:20] life and if you not careful Hallelujah
[11:23] to be on your knees with God you'll do
[11:25] things that your saved father did
[11:30] you said come on brother he make sense
[11:32] to that Abraham was a man called of God
[11:36] but way down inside Abraham had fear and
[11:39] a lying spirit
[11:42] inside and he was called of God you know
[11:45] what he told a lie when his son matured
[11:49] and got in the same situation he did the
[11:51] same thing his father
[11:53] did told a lie in the same situation
[11:56] this is my sister not my wife H so you
[11:58] know that that Spirit was in the
[12:00] bloodline and he kept following on up
[12:02] Hallelujah and from Isaac Hallelujah who
[12:05] told a lie his son after him told a liot
[12:10] Jacob Hallelujah Jacob lying and
[12:13] cheating ducking and dodging because the
[12:16] spirit of History Hallelujah was
[12:18] following him even though they were
[12:21] quoting God the same God who was in that
[12:24] Father Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen one
[12:28] of those Spirits are going to overcome
[12:29] you you got to be identified with the
[12:32] right kind of
[12:33] History amen but Church even if we look
[12:36] in there Hallelujah Abraham lied Isaac
[12:40] lied Jacob lied don't you know Jacob's
[12:42] boy did the same thing when we say
[12:45] Joseph was perfect but Joseph told a
[12:49] lie that Spirit was laying there so God
[12:52] hallelujah God begin to clean things up
[12:55] amen hallelujah because you don't want
[12:57] to be identified amen
[12:59] with evil Hallelujah and church it moves
[13:03] and it moves moves and it moves we have
[13:05] to be careful Hallelujah that we don't
[13:08] that that we don't take things lightly
[13:10] amen and you notice I I one thing I
[13:13] believe about church amen people are not
[13:17] conscious how they're being affected by
[13:20] their
[13:22] past if I can and you know sometimes you
[13:26] say things and you you're not trying to
[13:29] hurt nobody feelings and and all these
[13:31] things but you're trying to make a point
[13:33] you know every year they celebrate and
[13:35] and I I have no problem with the
[13:37] celebration I have no problem with what
[13:39] it means but you have to be careful of
[13:41] the spirit behind things you know we we
[13:44] celebrate every every every year as a
[13:46] culture MLK MLK Day Hallelujah if y'all
[13:50] know what that is that's that's that's
[13:52] the birth I mean the the the so-called
[13:55] CEO or president of the Civil Rights
[13:58] Movement huah but if you're not careful
[14:01] in your celebration or as parents or
[14:04] whatever you'll be expressing to your
[14:06] children all your pain all your hurt all
[14:10] the things you went through when God has
[14:12] given you
[14:14] Joy why should I tell my kids about I
[14:17] was once a slave when God has blown the
[14:19] Jubilee
[14:22] trumpet God has blowing a jubilee
[14:25] trumpet why shouldn't I be able to tell
[14:27] them you can be whatever you desire be
[14:30] with God on your
[14:32] side so we have to be careful which part
[14:35] of History we're being identified with
[14:37] amen we say where it's black history
[14:40] money amen for us to talk about black
[14:42] history we have to remember White
[14:48] History
[14:49] Hallelujah so in all that we have to be
[14:52] careful we're not bringing up the
[14:54] struggle and you know you have these
[14:56] leaders these leaders nowadays and they
[14:59] say you know I get in trouble for
[15:00] preaching like this amen but my heart is
[15:03] to be
[15:04] transparent amen my heart is to see
[15:07] people have victory in their lives amen
[15:10] you know and they talk about this civil
[15:13] rights movement and they say well the
[15:15] kids don't know what happened in the
[15:17] past and they're not keeping the
[15:18] struggle alive cuz I'm not in a struggle
[15:20] anymore
[15:22] hallelujah hallelujah when the Holy
[15:25] Ghost comes I have victory
[15:29] amen hallelujah only the devil puts
[15:32] things on the skin color of a man God
[15:36] never dealt with that God always dealt
[15:38] with the heart the first the first
[15:41] racism was up in
[15:43] heaven Hallelujah the first racial
[15:46] thought was up in heaven amen Satan
[15:49] looked at God and all his angels and he
[15:51] had envy and hatred and he said I want
[15:54] to be like God I want my own race
[15:59] but what he messed up he put his race on
[16:02] flesh God's race was a
[16:05] gene it was a seed Hallelujah it was
[16:09] something that couldn't be stopped by a
[16:11] water holes it couldn't be stopped by a
[16:14] whip amen hallelujah it was a
[16:18] bloodline Glory Church let me ask you
[16:22] are you keeping God's history
[16:27] relevant amen and we say that same God
[16:31] is here that that that that brought the
[16:33] children of Israel out of their bondage
[16:35] and crossed through the Red Sea I wonder
[16:38] how many of us are standing at a Red Sea
[16:40] in our
[16:42] lives Hallelujah but we're afraid of our
[16:46] history Hallelujah Church you got to be
[16:49] identified with it amen
[16:52] hallelujah Church there will be another
[16:57] shaking h if I can as I'm talking about
[17:00] these Natural Things am me you know I I
[17:02] the reason why I'm talking plain and I'm
[17:04] using a lot of natural things because I
[17:07] want to show you in a nutshell Satan
[17:10] ain't got no
[17:12] power he Ain got no power Church what he
[17:16] does is he digs back you know uh uh in
[17:19] the stores and some of the young ones
[17:20] may know they got this thing called
[17:22] throwback jerseys where they take the
[17:25] stars and the superstars that were once
[17:27] popular like a Magic Johnson who done
[17:29] been out of the league probably over 20
[17:31] years amen or or or a Michael Jordan
[17:34] another 10 15 years and they begin to
[17:37] put their names back on the line amen
[17:40] and they say wouldn't you love to have
[17:41] an authentic Magic Johnson Jersey
[17:44] Hallelujah magic don't even play anymore
[17:47] but they're trying to keep the spirit
[17:49] behind Magic's life alive and when you
[17:51] keep the ball player alive you keep his
[17:54] adulterous Life Alive you keep the fact
[17:57] that he had AIDS and he cheated on his
[17:59] wife you keep
[18:01] all all these things come along when you
[18:04] accept
[18:08] magic see I read a lot and I you know
[18:12] one thing about the word I'm I'm I'm in
[18:14] this world but I'm not of this world
[18:15] Hallelujah so you know what I do I study
[18:17] the lives of the people that my children
[18:19] are interested in because I want to show
[18:22] them the good and the B hallelujah amen
[18:25] I want to show them if you going to
[18:26] follow this be careful Hallelujah
[18:28] because D Man wasn't faithful how many
[18:31] Hallelujah although he had a nickname
[18:33] like magic he was tragic Hallelujah in
[18:36] his to his wife he was tragic in his
[18:39] relationship Hallelujah he was tragic as
[18:42] a
[18:45] father hallelujah oh my and that's the
[18:49] spirit that stays relevant when they
[18:51] create a magic throwback jersey or even
[18:55] you take you take Michael I the leag for
[18:57] years and all they're doing is comparing
[18:59] him to the next ball player and what
[19:01] they do Hallelujah they say well we
[19:03] going to bring his shoes
[19:06] back so it'll have the same effect that
[19:09] it had on the generation Hallelujah
[19:11] before them and what it does it keeps
[19:14] everything that he stands for alive
[19:17] another adulterous
[19:20] man another another man that you notice
[19:24] all these superstars of old never
[19:27] acknowledge God
[19:29] amen so the the the the the the the the
[19:32] the repeating of their lives is only
[19:35] giving Satan
[19:39] Glory but you got to be careful how you
[19:42] be identified clothes repeat theirselves
[19:46] church have you noticed amen and I'm a
[19:48] man who like to dress up for God but you
[19:50] notice both Ties Are Back In
[19:54] Style Hallelujah history repeating
[19:56] itself amen hallelujah
[19:59] sisters wearing high his shoes and they
[20:01] call them clogs and all kind of things
[20:03] back then they call them stacks and now
[20:06] that's the Le and so forth same old
[20:09] Spirits amen church but it gets more and
[20:12] more wickeder amen now they got this
[20:14] thing is accepted the men and the women
[20:17] called skinny jeans you know where that
[20:19] come from when I was in school they used
[20:21] to be called stretch pants and only the
[20:23] women would wear
[20:26] them but now they call them skinny jeans
[20:28] same devil just more and more wicked
[20:31] that you got the men walking around with
[20:32] tight clothes on
[20:35] now when the Devil comes back around
[20:39] it's more and more
[20:41] wicked oh my so what are we getting
[20:44] ready
[20:46] for I ain't going to be too much longer
[20:49] what are we getting ready for we're
[20:52] getting ready for the wrath of a god
[20:55] who's got tired of what he created
[21:02] look at it homosexuality On The Rise
[21:06] Hallelujah now the the main topics in
[21:08] our government are not about uh uh the
[21:11] well-being of the people it's about
[21:14] rights it's about can this one marry
[21:16] that one and and be accepted and you
[21:18] can't say nothing about it if not Sodom
[21:21] and gomor was
[21:24] here Sodom gomorra is full-fledged here
[21:27] upon the
[21:29] Earth but do we realize history is
[21:32] repeating itself Hallelujah and as we
[21:34] can see the evil being repeated Church
[21:37] in the midst of all that evil somebody
[21:39] found Grace hallelujah hallelujah Noah
[21:44] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and
[21:46] what I want you to understand God gave
[21:49] Noah the blueprint how to
[21:54] escape come on somebody God has also
[21:58] repeated history he's given us a
[22:00] blueprint a message showing us how to
[22:03] escape the wrath of God that's coming to
[22:06] the
[22:08] hurt
[22:11] Hallelujah people are so caught up with
[22:14] the spirit of pleasure amen and all
[22:17] these things repeating Hallelujah and if
[22:19] you if you still not quite with me think
[22:22] about this one
[22:24] remember like now look at the body style
[22:27] of the Mustang
[22:30] Ford Mustang that body style is not
[22:34] new somebody talk to me it's not new
[22:39] that same style come from the 60s and
[22:41] you know what when they first decided to
[22:44] do that and they put it out in the
[22:45] public that they was going to do it the
[22:47] car was bought before it was even
[22:50] made the car was on back order before
[22:54] they could even produce it why because
[22:56] all the people that loved it then they
[22:58] loved it now and That's what Satan does
[23:02] hallelujah he knows what was popular he
[23:05] knows how to get the people attention
[23:06] church that's why we don't have no new
[23:11] music we got new lyrics over the same
[23:15] beats amen you notice that not Christian
[23:18] music is real hard to find good clean
[23:21] Christian music because they may have
[23:23] good lyrics and good thoughts but they
[23:25] can't make up a beat so they what was
[23:29] popular you never know you may be
[23:30] singing Amazing Grace over a shake ring
[23:37] Roby Hallelujah so you know what that
[23:40] mean that means your worship is not
[23:45] pure Hallelujah see church and you say
[23:48] well back to Justin you say well Justin
[23:50] he's only 19 and that's too much power
[23:53] for a young man that age you know what
[23:55] I've seen that spirit before I've seen a
[23:57] young man with power before but this
[24:00] young man hu was able to hold that power
[24:03] this young man name was
[24:05] Josiah Hallelujah had a kingdom amen the
[24:08] Bible says he went to the left nor to
[24:11] the right but he stayed right with the
[24:12] truth amen I've seen that spirit before
[24:16] where God just poured his riches and His
[24:18] blessings out on a young man Hallelujah
[24:21] but he had the character to keep it amen
[24:23] God there never was a man as wise and as
[24:26] rich as Solomon
[24:29] so don't tell me you can't have the best
[24:31] of the best and still serve
[24:35] God hallelujah Glory there's nothing new
[24:39] Under the St but where do you want to be
[24:41] identified what part of history is
[24:43] following you you know what they say
[24:45] sometimes we anoint our kids you just
[24:48] like your old sorry
[24:51] Daddy and that's what he going to be cuz
[24:55] you missing the adjective you put before
[24:57] Daddy
[25:00] he man said Daddy sorry okay but I must
[25:03] be sorry too you going to be just like
[25:05] your old trifling mama mama trifling but
[25:09] I must be trifling
[25:12] too y'all don't get quiet on
[25:15] me Hallelujah see you anoint the word
[25:20] for your day you got to know how to
[25:23] anoint the word amen God has given us
[25:25] the word we have the word but it's up to
[25:28] you to anoint the word remember when
[25:30] Jesus was sitting in Simon's house H and
[25:33] they wasn't paying him no attention that
[25:35] prostitute came in there and anointed
[25:40] him that prostitute came in there with
[25:43] that Alabaster Box Hallelujah and she
[25:45] said you don't know the price of this
[25:47] oil you don't know what I went through
[25:50] amen I know my past is wicked but I'mma
[25:53] change that
[25:54] today
[25:56] hallu Hallelujah and she would not let
[25:59] history repeat itself like that anymore
[26:02] but she went down a different way
[26:05] Hallelujah Church what happened they
[26:08] said if he knew who was touching him he
[26:11] wouldn't let her Hallelujah but Jesus
[26:13] said leave her alone y'all don't
[26:15] understand the work she's doing upon me
[26:17] Hallelujah she was anointing the word so
[26:21] the word had to give her heart desire
[26:24] Hallelujah Church you got to anoint the
[26:26] word
[26:28] Hallelujah see if you anoint that word
[26:32] that word will give you your heart's
[26:33] desire amen like I said this morning
[26:36] that woman at the well she anointed the
[26:38] word Hallelujah Jesus begin to talk to
[26:40] her and she begin to talk back but you
[26:43] notice Jesus was talking natural and she
[26:47] was talking
[26:49] spiritual he began to talk about the
[26:51] fathers the fathers in the mountain and
[26:53] they don't worship like I worship and
[26:55] then Jesus say how many husbands you got
[26:57] Hallelujah then she be to respond and
[27:00] then she begin to
[27:02] say they say when Messiah
[27:05] coming he G to say these kind of things
[27:07] Hallelujah so Jesus dealt with her in a
[27:10] natural realm to bring out her
[27:12] spirituality Hallelujah and as he talked
[27:15] with her the more he talked with her the
[27:16] more word came
[27:18] out Hallelujah according to history she
[27:22] wasn't supposed to be able to do that
[27:24] but her history was her fathers knew
[27:26] Jacob amen amen her father's Worship in
[27:30] that mountain so Jesus had to come with
[27:33] a word hallelujah and she said I know
[27:36] when Messiah coming she anointed the
[27:38] word all Jesus could say was I am he
[27:42] Hallelujah she anointed the word amen oh
[27:45] my church we got to anoint the word
[27:49] hallelujah had a right anointed the word
[27:51] Amen brother random sitting there
[27:53] talking Hallelujah and he's talking
[27:55] about all the things God has done in his
[27:57] ministry and and Supernatural in the
[27:58] third pool and hi and right just sitting
[28:00] there listening and she couldn't help it
[28:02] no more she said that ain't nothing but
[28:03] the truth and the anointing came
[28:07] down do I got a church in here do I got
[28:11] a church in here hallelujah the prophet
[28:13] of God say she said the right thing she
[28:16] anointed the word and then God the holy
[28:18] spirit says give her whatever she asked
[28:21] forah whatever she won't give it to her
[28:24] he said she said so what should I ask
[28:26] for the prophet of God say I don't know
[28:28] no ask for whatever it's yours he say
[28:30] you got a sick sister she could be here
[28:32] you got children you're poor whatever
[28:34] you ask
[28:35] for but
[28:37] God only sent that anointing because he
[28:41] knew that she had the thoughts of God he
[28:45] knew she wasn't going to ask for me
[28:48] no Hallelujah she asked for salvation
[28:52] Hallelujah and God gave her exactly what
[28:55] she asked for she said Give me the
[28:58] salvation of my boys and you say those
[29:00] boys were snickering and laughing and
[29:02] soon as she said that Hallelujah they
[29:03] started crying Hallelujah and weeping
[29:06] right there the very thing she asked
[29:10] for and she went down in history as
[29:13] somebody we quote to this
[29:18] day church as history repeats itself and
[29:22] it comes back and back and on and on
[29:24] look the reason why they have all these
[29:26] Throwbacks not only just the Mustang the
[29:28] Camaro the
[29:30] charger all these body styles are way
[29:33] back when but now they're keeping it

[29:42] SP I want me a Mustang see oh did you
[29:46] know that that got a spirit behind I'm a

[30:29] US where did he
[30:31] start in
[30:33] Hollywood H showing that Paris used to
[30:35] be the leader now we the leader Hall you
[30:38] know and I was saying you look at how
[30:39] history gets more and more wicked y'all
[30:41] know in New York now I'm not saying
[30:43] these things for you to go and look it
[30:46] up because you better be careful you
[30:48] might not can't handle some of the stuff

[30:52] up and get a spirit on
[30:54] you Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah go look
[30:58] up go go look up what God did not what

[31:04] New York City every year they have ride
[31:06] the subway in your underwear
[31:10] day every year thousands of people get
[31:14] on the subway and the underway and it
[31:16] gets bigger and bigger every year now
[31:19] it's to the point where more countries
[31:20] are doing it on the same day they doing
[31:22] it in New
[31:23] York see it gets more and more wicked
[31:27] more and more more evil and God is
[31:30] looking down on it saying what's about
[31:32] to happen Church he's saying my spirit
[31:35] will not strive with man
[31:40] always now ask yourself is God pleased
[31:43] with your life or was God looking at you
[31:46] saying you know what I hate I even
[31:48] created
[31:51] you boy I know that's kind of
[31:53] stiff but that's the spirit of this age
[31:56] God is looking down at his people and
[31:59] he's he he hated that he even created
[32:02] man because everything they think about
[32:05] the imagination of his heart is evil
[32:09] Wicked you know they started out with
[32:11] arrows and Bows just enough to stop the
[32:13] man now they got things to blow him up
[32:15] in
[32:17] pieces make you even forget he was there

[32:32] because it's unconverted it becomes more
[32:34] and more wicked his thoughts become more
[32:36] and more
[32:39] evil oh my look at it Church Hallelujah
[32:42] we the spirit that's supposed to be on
[32:44] his bride is spoken word Authority we're
[32:47] supposed to be able to speak creation
[32:50] but the spirit we're fighting against is
[32:52] the spirit of man trying to create
[32:54] another
[32:56] man Hallelujah they're in their
[32:58] Laboratories trying to make another man
[33:01] you'll never be able to do it through
[33:03] science Hallelujah because that's God's
[33:05] permissible will
[33:09] hallelujah oh my the original way the
[33:13] way that can and Abel came was God's
[33:15] permissible will that was not God's
[33:18] perfect
[33:21] way Hallelujah if you understand your
[33:23] message H the prophet of God say Eve was
[33:26] supposed to speak her children into
[33:28] creation you said but she couldn't wait
[33:31] and she stepped from behind that Holy
[33:32] Veil and a lust Veil came down oh my
[33:36] church but church we can see all these

[35:34] laughing whatever
[35:36] else you know but he was watching the
[35:39] spirit you know she was one of the first
[35:41] women to rebel against her husband
[35:43] before a live audience she was the first
[35:46] one to tell her husband no I ain't doing
[35:47] that I make just as much money as you
[35:49] make and I'm going to
[35:54] work he was watching that spirit
[35:58] he was what was he watching he was
[35:59] watching
[36:01] Jezebel Hallelujah telling Ahab what to
[36:06] do oh
[36:09] my and I know you may think D you just
[36:12] so
[36:15] hard it is so hard I want to I want to
[36:18] feel
[36:19] happy this makes me
[36:22] happy Hallelujah to know that God got
[36:24] his eyes on
[36:25] me to know that my past Hallelujah my
[36:30] past does not control my
[36:35] future Hallelujah and because of my past
[36:38] he didn't erase my
[36:44] future
[36:46] hallelujah oh my church look at
[36:50] this the cycle of time swings back ever
[36:53] so often history repeats itself and the
[36:56] scripture repeats itself down through
[36:58] the age and Scholar knows that
[37:01] Hallelujah every study from the
[37:03] spiritual standpoint to watch how
[37:05] scripture will repeat itself Hallelujah
[37:08] run in Cycles you know one thing I pay
[37:11] attention to the prophet of God say
[37:12] every seven years you go through a
[37:15] change from 7 14 21 28 30 is it 32 35
[37:23] Hallelujah on up 42 49 every seven years
[37:27] you go through a change that what the
[37:29] prophet said amen so you need to look at
[37:31] the cycle of life you in Hallelujah and
[37:33] if you're a Christian your change is
[37:35] supposed to be for the
[37:37] greater and people don't realize they're
[37:40] running from God they're running from
[37:41] God they won't fully Hallelujah
[37:43] surrender themselves and they're trapped
[37:45] in a cycle they're trapped in a cycle of
[37:49] evil and they can't say why I keep doing
[37:53] this because history repeats itself
[37:58] Hallelujah church if you look at how the
[38:01] church went out look at it and I'm about
[38:05] to close look at man's heart was getting
[38:09] more and more evil more and more wicked
[38:12] and God look down on man and he said you
[38:14] know what I'mma
[38:15] destroy I'mma wipe it out the face of
[38:17] the Earth he said I'm G give him a
[38:19] warning first though I'm going send a
[38:22] messenger down there you know what he
[38:24] says but before you even do that
[38:26] somebody's going to experience a Rapture
[38:28] [Music]
[38:31] Hallelujah before he even did that Enoch
[38:34] was
[38:37] gone Hallelujah I wonder is there
[38:41] anybody here already caught
[38:43] up
[38:45] hallu Church The Rapture is a body of
[38:49] Believers the Rapture is a revelation
[38:52] the Rapture is a process
[38:55] am and we are supposed to be that Enoch
[38:58] I'm not
[39:00] Noah I'm not Noah I'm not preparing
[39:04] myself to go through the Judgment
[39:06] Hallelujah that's not my history my

[39:19] Enoch of the Bible amen
[39:21] hallelujah who walked with God Enoch was
[39:25] and was not
[39:29] that's our history our history is to be
[39:32] so in tune with God hallelujah that we
[39:35] will call the Rapture the prophet of God
[39:37] said in this last day the bride will be
[39:39] so much like him that God can't take it
[39:41] no
[39:43] more he's looking down on you and he say
[39:46] man I just I oh man I'm just longing to
[39:50] be with my body I just oh I just oh my
[39:54] head I just can't take it no more I got
[39:57] the put it on my
[40:02] body he's the head right and we're the
[40:05] body what good is a body without a head
[40:08] what good is a head without a
[40:11] body church that's where we are that's
[40:14] what we are look at history amen it's
[40:18] more and more wicked you know what they
[40:19] did some people hallelujah and I ain't
[40:21] going to go this far but you know uh
[40:23] some people when they look at Obama
[40:25] they're comparing him to Hitler
[40:29] H now I ain't never studied and I don't
[40:32] have it don't matter to me one way or
[40:34] another cuz you know they they oh he the
[40:36] Antichrist no he ain't Pope is the
[40:40] prophecy you can say what you want the
[40:42] man made this law made that Law whatever
[40:45] the prophet of the God said the pope is
[40:47] the
[40:49] Antichrist so you can get as mad as you
[40:51] want to be you can look at him and say I
[40:53] can't stand him or whatever just like
[40:56] just like uh uh presidents before
[40:58] Hallelujah they were fulfilling what God
[41:01] wanted to be fulfilled
[41:04] amen Bush did it Reagan did it Clinton
[41:08] did it and now Obama gonna do
[41:11] it so don't get caught up in your
[41:13] feelings cuz your feelings will make you
[41:15] miss the real purpose of God hallelujah
[41:18] that's what happened with Ahab when he
[41:20] walked down there with jiah I mean uh
[41:22] when when je Jehoshaphat and Ahab walked
[41:25] down there to Micaiah he said is there
[41:27] not another prophet in the land Micaiah
[41:29] jehoshaphat's word I mean ahab's words
[41:32] was verbatim yeah yeah there's another
[41:37] Prophet but I don't like
[41:41] him look how stupid that is he
[41:44] acknowledged the man to be a prophet and
[41:48] what is a prophet a seer of God's
[41:52] will he acknowledged it hallelujah
[41:56] hallelujah he he acknowledged it he said
[41:58] yeah he's a prophet but I hate him why
[42:02] because he never says anything good
[42:03] about
[42:04] me what that had to do with the truth
[42:08] see he let his own personal feelings get
[42:10] in the way of the truth and you realize
[42:12] people are doing that in church they're
[42:14] bouncing from this church bouncing from
[42:16] that church cuz they looking at the man
[42:17] of God and they letting their personal
[42:19] feelings get in the way forget that he
[42:21] staying with the message of the hour
[42:23] forget that he preaching the gospel
[42:24] truth forget that he's anointed they
[42:27] worried about his
[42:30] socks they worried about what kind of
[42:32] car he drive
[42:35] nonsense amen as long as the man is
[42:37] stand with the word he's on the word
[42:39] filled with the holy spirit all that
[42:41] other stuff is
[42:43] irrelevant and to show you how silly
[42:46] Ahab was amen they sent the S the S The
[42:49] Messengers down there come down there he
[42:51] said hey should I go up with him he said
[42:55] sure go up
[42:59] power is
[43:01] slapping Ahab didn't I tell you to tell
[43:04] me the truth so what was that saying he
[43:06] knew he wasn't supposed to
[43:10] go he knew he wasn't supposed to go but
[43:14] he let his own personal feelings of who
[43:16] was telling him not to go get in the way
[43:19] and how often we do that in the church
[43:22] we hear the word we hear what we're
[43:23] guilty of but because the vessel is
[43:26] coming from we can't
[43:28] receive don't go down in history like
[43:31] that Hallelujah because he rejected he
[43:34] said I told you to tell me only what God
[43:36] was
[43:39] say he asked for the truth but he really
[43:41] didn't want it and Ahab say okay I will
[43:45] if you even come
[43:49] back he said I see Israel Hallelujah
[43:53] sheep scatter without a Shepherd
[43:54] Hallelujah he said if you even come back
[43:57] God never spoke to
[43:59] me that man would have told me that I
[44:02] would have fell on my knees and say Lord
[44:04] have mercy on
[44:06] me but because it was a spirit of Lou
[44:10] the because it was a wicked spirit that
[44:13] was moving through the church ages who
[44:15] heard the word and still wasn't going to
[44:17] listen still had Pride Hallelujah still
[44:20] was
[44:23] rebellious that's the problem
[44:25] today h Same Spirit I was on Ahab
[44:29] hearing the truth hearing it come from a
[44:31] God-fearing
[44:34] man but they don't like
[44:37] it be careful history going to repeat
[44:39] itself remember what happened to Ahab he
[44:42] went on down there anyway riding on his
[44:47] chair
[44:49] Hallelujah that was his
[44:51] end Hallelujah so church we have to be
[44:54] careful what we're being identified with
[44:57] amen history will repeat itself but in
[45:02] my closing one thing I want you to
[45:05] understand just as God had a Welch
[45:09] Revival there will be a BRI
[45:12] Revival I know people these theologist
[45:15] looking back and saying there there they
[45:17] brother BR say won't be no Revival and
[45:19] this and that and all the stuff of
[45:21] whatever what else is going to get us
[45:22] out of here
[45:27] if we don't have our own personal
[45:29] Revival we going to miss it I ain't
[45:32] talking about a group big churches and
[45:34] people flocking in but I'm talking about
[45:36] you what is a Revival a Revival is a
[45:40] killing a Revival is killing this man
[45:43] hallelujah amen the prophet of God said
[45:46] when the ocean has a Revival what does
[45:48] it do it pushes all the trash
[45:52] outen history repeats itself every time
[45:56] that W go out it pushes some more trash
[45:59] on the bank it do it over and over again
[46:02] what I love about the ocean you study
[46:04] the
[46:05] ocean anything that doesn't belong in
[46:08] there it's going to find its way to the
[46:13] shore you can drop a dead body in
[46:17] there and people I dropped in the ocean
[46:20] I'm I'm free oh my nobody never know and
[46:23] one day that body going to raise to the
[46:28] top it raised to the top and all of a
[46:32] sudden the very thing that you thought
[46:34] was hidden because it don't belong
[46:37] there your secret you thought was hidden
[46:41] in the ocean Hallelujah that sickness
[46:45] Hallelujah you thought that nobody else
[46:47] would see Hallelujah the way the ocean
[46:50] is built the ocean is built to stay
[46:54] clean why because it's preserving
[46:57] life amen and you can't have all that
[47:01] other stuff inside that's why when they
[47:02] have oil spills what happen to the
[47:04] oil push to the shore
[47:09] hallelujah amen you can leave a boat out
[47:11] there with no with no Captain it just
[47:14] out there drifting all by
[47:16] itself and one day it'll find itself
[47:20] what they call it
[47:23] shipwreck the only way it can be wrecked
[47:25] is if it find itself to something and
[47:28] normally that's to another bank amen so
