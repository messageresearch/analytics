you be grateful may the Lord bless you for it and I also wanted to say something else the if there has been some people in the church who have heard something according to me about me with brother Didier I was with him yesterday we talked you know and we fixed everything and I asked him to forgive me for everything that he had against me and I asked him to forgive me in my dick he told me if you asked me to forgive you was that the cleanest Advantage you are clean before God and before brothers so I wanted to let you know that if you have heard something about that it's not something that he had against me because I stole his mind but it was something that happened back home in our church and we fixed everything [Music] it's something to me it's considered like my past GGA DTA is my brother safam Emma his wife is my sister and everything that happened between the two of us is and now we're looking at the future may the Lord bless you we can stand [Music] from verse 1 to verse 5. before reading the Bible we can pray Lord Our God and our father we have opened your word Lord you know we are worthy to be standing before this word but it's you the worthy one because the word of God said that the Lamb of God was worthy to open the book and to break the seals Lord this morning oh God we want heavenly father to pray that you come and you uh break the word of the living life so that your people be nourished by it this is not my word but it's your word come and Vindicated May 45 broken hearts I don't in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our God amen amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 to verse 5. in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep air let's pray the Jews and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters let there be light and there was light and God saw the light and that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night [Music] and the evening and the morning where the first day may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I have a little subject and to Chile there was your evening there will also be morning if you were careful to what we read the Bible told us the Earth was void and empty the word Darkness on the surface [Music] and the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and the Bible say in the evening and the morning were the first day civil considering on the leaves the scriptures that we've read you see it's uh telling us the picture of the the Earth that was in chaos those scriptures to talk about the transforming power of God and foreign [Applause] they feel the spirit of God was moving upon the Earth [Applause] God loved the Earth with the condition that she found herself no this is not the Earth but it was the love of God that was projected God loved the Earth no matter the conditions and the cares that the Earth that the love of God transforms from the chaos she found herself to a Garden of Eden so when there was Darkness on the Earth the Earth in that condition Nation the love of God filled the Earth foreign when this great chaos was here nothing only uh rocks dancer foreign uh that word means I don't know that in English oh it's like it's a crowd that the chicken that the chicken does Bruce yeah coming up like the chicken there's for uh her kids and when he started talking he said that this made this big foreign it's something that has changed it must change it must be made different from the thing that was before and that's what God did with you god transformed here made the Earth she was in the beginning God transformed nothing but chaos a total chaos of God was upon the prince of waters and all the picture changed to a Garden of Eden brother brother the power of transformation of God can take something that's nothing the power of transformation of God can take something that's nothing I want to inform you this morning yeah no matter the state that you find yourself in order care the chaos you find yourself God can take you from this stage and make out of you something better God can take you from Japan and make out of you something marvelous yes my brothers it's what God did with yours and we are taken from the Earth God always does the same thing when he tried one is getting ready like he did for that old start that's the Earth he had to separate the doctors when he's getting ready to use the group of people we must he must divide the darkness [Music] when God is getting ready to use an individual [Music] s God will certainly for his own Glory because he wants to use separate you from Darkness and that's his way of doing things Ellen [Applause] and there was like [Music] the light comes from God the light comes from God [Music] the light comes from his spoken word and the spoken word said let there be light and when there was no light he sent his life his light to divide Darkness from the light and the brothers that word of Commandments to the heavens when God spoke he said that let it be light Abraham says that word that came from God brought light to the heaven so that the sun could shine that what God did in the beginning today his word a second is though the thing that Cast Away unbelief God pronounced himself it was the spoken word of God and the same way God spoke in the beginning it's the thing that casts away the atmosphere of Darkness God cannot pronounce his words and that word failed to be fulfilled the word of God is eternal God is eternal his word Remains the Same his word can never fail to come she is God is God is in his word and his word is Delight amen that's why my brothers and sisters I want you to understand that there was a evening the night always uh announced the coming of them the night always and when there is nights it's the coming of of of thick Darkness it's a total chaos but the same way there was a night I know that was announcing the coming of Darkness did the same way announcing the coming of son of the Sun and when the sun start to shine that announces peace it announces every good things announce his growth the light of the sun announces every great things every good thing it's done when the sun is still shining it's during the night Darkness Journey paper God cannot pronounce his word and that word failed to fulfillment myself yes my brothers and sisters I cannot do it and foreign [Music] he says here in this uh sermon Jairus and the Divine Healing I will not be too long in paragraph 62. we say glory to God glory to the Lord and may the Lord Jesus our lord Jesus Christ be glorified let's say glory to the Lord May our lord Jesus be glorified the powers of the almighty God who created the heavens and who are deployed it he spoke and said and things started to be manifested for nothing if God says things started
