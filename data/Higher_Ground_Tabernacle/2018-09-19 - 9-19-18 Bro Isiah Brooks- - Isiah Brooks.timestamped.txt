[18:23] that is the only way we're going to make
[18:25] it by him sending his power you
[18:32] appreciate the Lord Jesus we thank God
[18:35] for His grace and His mercy we're gonna
[18:40] go just right into the Word of God as we
[18:45] stand we thank you and thank him for his
[18:50] presence trust the Lord would minister
[18:58] this thought to you
[18:59] Colossians the second chapter and then
[19:03] we'll go to Ephesians 1 Colossians 2
[19:11] we read that the second and third verses
[19:19] that their hearts might be comforted
[19:23] being knit together in love and unto all
[19:27] riches of the full assurance of
[19:29] understanding - acknowledgement of the
[19:33] mystery of God and of the Father and of
[19:36] Christ in whom are here all treasures of
[19:41] wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest
[19:47] any man should beguile you with enticing
[19:50] words theevans one Ephesians 1 9 and 10
[20:08] let's go to the six first yeah I could
[20:11] read the whole thing really but let's
[20:14] start there the six fifth first I'm
[20:18] sorry having predestinated us unto the
[20:22] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[20:24] himself according to the good pleasure
[20:26] of his will to the praise of the glory
[20:30] of His grace where and he have made us
[20:33] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[20:36] redemption through his blood the
[20:38] forgiveness of sin according to the
[20:41] riches of His grace wherein he have
[20:45] abound toward us in all wisdom and
[20:47] prudence having made known unto us the
[20:49] mystery of his will according to his
[20:52] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[20:54] himself you love the Lord let us pray
[20:59] father we thank you for your grace we
[21:01] surely thank you for your mercy and God
[21:04] you're being good to us better to us
[21:06] than we've been to ourselves we pray
[21:08] Lord God this evening Lord that you have
[21:10] a preeminence in the service Lord give
[21:14] us grace to move completely out of your
[21:15] way and we'll be careful to give you the
[21:17] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[21:20] name we pray amen
[21:21] you may be seated I was thinking by
[21:29] God's grace how blessed we are and you
[21:32] hear me say that and I say it often
[21:34] because it is true we are blessed that
[21:40] God will would give us secrets he would
[21:46] tell us things that he wouldn't tell no
[21:50] other I'm not sure whether you realized
[21:55] tonight that we who are called bride
[22:00] know more about God than even Israel
[22:04] knew because Israel worshiped under
[22:09] shadows and types you and I know more
[22:13] than Abel did April
[22:18] worship under a type and even though God
[22:23] gave the secret of what he desired from
[22:27] Abel I doubt if it was truly revealed to
[22:34] Abel what the lamb represented all we
[22:40] know is that God to Eva are able to give
[22:43] it and that revelation was sacrifice a
[22:46] lamb God requires blood even when you
[22:51] think about Cain how that God never gave
[22:55] him the revelation of the type God did
[23:01] tell him what he needed to do he just
[23:03] gave him a head knowledge and because of
[23:06] it not being in his heart to accept it
[23:09] he wouldn't humble himself to even the
[23:12] truth when he knew that God could not
[23:14] lie
[23:15] God gave Cain an opportunity to move
[23:21] forward but Cain refused it and by this
[23:23] I by doing so he marked himself we
[23:29] understand the Bible said without the
[23:30] shedding of blood there is no remission
[23:32] of sin don't you know there are many
[23:35] Christians today who don't even
[23:37] understand that's that Scripture and are
[23:40] many people Amen who depend upon their
[23:43] churches or the affiliation familywize
[23:48] you know my father founded this church
[23:51] or my mother was part of this church
[23:54] since it's been founded but those things
[23:58] are not acceptable with God God has a
[24:06] way of doing things he can be so deep
[24:09] yet so simple
[24:11] I marvel ah how God took Israel or
[24:18] Abraham and began a nation it took April
[24:24] from a place that you and I would not
[24:28] have expected God to choose from Abraham
[24:32] was chosen by God and he lived in child
[24:36] ear which was another place we called
[24:38] Babylon where they were great idol
[24:41] worshipers in and things and no doubt
[24:44] Abraham had seen many people worship
[24:47] things that would not even respond when
[24:51] they were called upon but there was
[24:54] something on the inside of Abraham that
[24:57] made him know that the voice that was
[24:58] speaking to him was God and you and I
[25:02] must understand that that's how it
[25:04] always worked
[25:06] we ourselves a man don't even know why
[25:10] how come we when God called us we
[25:13] dropped everything and followed him we
[25:17] don't even know why Amen that after God
[25:20] called us we never could get away from
[25:22] him something God did on the inside of
[25:27] us because listen he never lost one when
[25:31] you and I understand that hear God the
[25:35] Almighty God you and I don't understand
[25:37] what heaven is like we can't imagine
[25:38] what it's like the splendor the glory
[25:42] that awaits us and yet when God came
[25:46] down to earth to hide himself he hid
[25:49] himself behind badger skin and a badger
[25:54] is a bad animal badger and we realized
[26:00] by God's grace that's how God hides
[26:03] himself for an example Amen God doesn't
[26:08] take someone that's already perfect he
[26:11] takes the imperfect
[26:12] and make them perfect that's the secrets
[26:17] of God he can take that which we may
[26:20] consider nothing and make something out
[26:23] of it when we think about God amen and
[26:28] himself unveiling himself to us I do
[26:35] know exactly how much the first Adam
[26:39] knew but no doubt his knowledge was
[26:44] limited you say well why do you say that
[26:47] because Jesus being God and man his
[26:51] knowledge was limited he never
[26:54] understood and never knew amen the
[26:56] coming of the Christ or the resurrection
[26:59] i'ma put this way of the rapture until
[27:04] after his death burial and resurrection
[27:10] we never he walked as a man but yet only
[27:14] inside he was God it was such a mystery
[27:20] that God for thousands of years hid
[27:26] himself behind badger skin nobody knew
[27:31] what was back to accept the prophets
[27:33] they knew that that was the Elohim they
[27:37] knew that was the Almighty God now you
[27:39] say what do you mean because everybody
[27:41] couldn't go behind that great veil only
[27:45] the high priest and everybody was God
[27:49] from afar can you imagine in their minds
[27:52] what they went through how they thought
[27:53] God might Abid even though the word was
[27:57] given to them they still was veiled they
[28:00] still couldn't see God like we see him
[28:05] amen so you and I must understand this
[28:08] this the knowledge in which we have been
[28:11] given is the knowledge that God here
[28:14] from Israel behind the badger skin
[28:18] there was a powerful revelation behind
[28:21] the badger skin and God kept it a secret
[28:25] and in this secret no man a man could
[28:31] control how this art
[28:37] Travel remember it meant David wanted to
[28:40] put it on a cart and he tried to bring a
[28:43] new way and in that new way a man was
[28:47] killed because Amen God wanted to do
[28:51] something in the place that he built
[28:55] this something fall now we know brother
[28:59] branham said it like this
[29:00] he said scientists have been trying to
[29:03] dispute whether there was that whether
[29:06] man thinketh in his heart now scientists
[29:10] have found out that there's a small
[29:14] compartment in the heart where there are
[29:17] no blood vessels and in that little
[29:21] chamber is the throne of God behind all
[29:29] of this dust behind all of this blood
[29:31] vessels behind all of this chemistry
[29:34] behind all of this dirt God hid himself
[29:43] or the place of himself in the heart of
[29:47] a man this man had been liking as a dog
[29:53] he had been liking as a swine he has
[29:58] been liking his law the loss of all
[30:00] creatures since the fall but yet God
[30:04] never changed his mind about where he
[30:08] wanted to abide who and we realize amen
[30:14] that this secret is not given to
[30:16] everybody some people go to church just
[30:20] to feel God some people go they want to
[30:25] know that God is real just by the way
[30:27] they shout by the way they dance or by
[30:30] the way they speak in tongues but we
[30:31] know something that a lot of people
[30:34] don't know you and I understand the very
[30:40] mystery and you say mystery it was a
[30:42] mystery when Nicodemus was told by Jesus
[30:46] you must be born again
[30:48] and Nicodemus in his intellect says
[30:51] well uh should a man die or should a man
[30:55] be placed back into his mother's womb
[30:57] and be born again and he says no no no
[31:00] mama not Nicodemus I'm talking about
[31:02] something that's more higher something
[31:05] higher than the natural man something
[31:07] greater than the natural birth that
[31:10] which is flesh is flesh and that which
[31:12] is Spirit is spirit mom or not you must
[31:16] be born again
[31:17] now even Jesus had a doctrine that they
[31:21] could not understand because Jesus was
[31:23] telling them saying things that they
[31:25] didn't understand what do you mean he
[31:28] said it's good that I come if I had not
[31:31] come to you you would have had a cloak
[31:34] but now that I've come to you this
[31:37] righteousness that you think you have is
[31:40] righteousness like a a whitish supper
[31:42] cup your dad on the outside and you're
[31:46] dead on the inside you look good on the
[31:48] outside but you're dead on the inside
[31:50] hallelujah and Jesus going to say except
[31:53] you believe that I am he you should
[31:55] likewise die in your sins you know what
[31:58] only a few out of those people heard
[32:01] what he was saying a lot of people
[32:03] thought he was was a devil you mean to
[32:06] tell me I've had all of this education
[32:08] and you're trying to tell me I'm lost
[32:10] because I don't believe in you think
[32:13] about it
[32:14] a man who had a bad reputation a man who
[32:18] had a reputation that he was born out of
[32:20] fornication and to the Jews that was a
[32:23] very wicked thing hallelujah it meant a
[32:27] man a man who they accused of being a
[32:29] wine-bibber right and so how do you come
[32:33] amen drinking and things like that
[32:35] when John the Baptist didn't even do
[32:37] that see he didn't have a good
[32:39] reputation he came from Nazareth but oh
[32:43] oh did God not hide himself he had a bad
[32:47] reputation when he wasn't bad hallelujah
[32:50] even the rich young ruler knew that
[32:54] though he may have heard so many things
[32:55] about him he approached him good master
[33:00] out of all the things you see everybody
[33:03] can't see that gee
[33:04] good hallelujah because Jesus even said
[33:09] to the rich young ruler why call it army
[33:12] good only God is good so he was trying
[33:15] to really give him a revelation if
[33:17] you're gonna call me good you calling me
[33:20] God hallelujah then what must I do to
[33:24] inherit eternal life and that's where we
[33:29] make mistakes we approach God and you've
[33:32] heard me say this before Lord what must
[33:34] I do to inherit eternal life we always
[33:39] thought there was something we could do
[33:41] to eat hallelujah to inherit eternal
[33:45] life but won't you to understand your
[33:48] eternal life amen is a gift that God
[33:53] gave you and I before the foundation of
[33:56] the world it is not him that will it no
[33:59] he that run it but God who shows mercy
[34:02] see but we have a duty there's something
[34:06] that God has for us to do and you must
[34:09] know what it is the revelation must be
[34:13] given to you as a individual it's not
[34:17] given as a church or a group but you
[34:20] must know what you come to do every time
[34:24] God had a purpose he defended that
[34:27] purpose he made sure that purpose was
[34:31] met huh because the word of God cannot
[34:34] go out void God has a purpose in doing
[34:38] everything everything God so believe in
[34:43] the death burial resurrection everything
[34:46] has that order is that right and you and
[34:52] I must understand in order to go to
[34:55] heaven we must have that order
[34:59] hallelujah there must be a death before
[35:02] there can be a resurrection now I want
[35:09] you to run
[35:10] that the mystery that Paul had was
[35:12] amazing because all alone the Jews
[35:17] thought there was a Bride of Christ or
[35:21] the bride of God and remember God wrote
[35:24] them a bill of divorcement but there is
[35:28] another people that they were not even
[35:31] considering to be a part of the
[35:34] inheritance of God because they thought
[35:37] they were it they looked down on the
[35:40] Gentiles they looked down on the
[35:42] Samaritans huh because they thought they
[35:45] were it they didn't know something else
[35:49] was coming that was greater they didn't
[35:53] understand the scripture when I was here
[35:55] talking about God was gonna have a bride
[35:57] that God would have a bride call
[36:00] Hepzibah they rabbit but they didn't
[36:06] understand it they couldn't understand
[36:09] how the Gentiles those dirty dogs don't
[36:13] swine eating people hey shrimp eating
[36:17] hallelujah snake eating whatever they
[36:20] were very unclean how can God have
[36:22] anything to do with that right because
[36:26] remember it when guardians I had to
[36:28] speak to Peter when God told Peter to go
[36:31] to Camille's house he dropped down that
[36:33] that uh a sheet of all unclean things
[36:37] and Peter said to God oh no listen I've
[36:42] never put anything unclean in my mouth
[36:46] what he said I've been a faithful Jew
[36:48] I've been faithful to the law he himself
[36:53] did not know the change of the
[36:55] dispensation hallelujah
[36:58] but God review it filled that they meant
[37:00] to Paul and Paul say whatever you eat
[37:04] you give Thanksgiving God does sanctify
[37:06] day so you understand God doesn't she'll
[37:11] show all of his secrets to everybody but
[37:13] to those who are chosen and elected the
[37:17] scripture says is given for you to know
[37:19] the mysteries of the kingdom
[37:24] it was it was kid who thought he could
[37:27] work his way into the kingdom but it was
[37:31] Abel who caught the revelation I am
[37:33] sceptic I am accepted in the lamb I know
[37:42] that lamb has taken my place I'm a
[37:47] sinner but this lamb takes my Kennedy he
[37:52] takes my guilt hallelujah and I am set
[37:56] free see that's a mystery that a lot of
[38:00] people don't understand that's why they
[38:02] don't have joy because they don't
[38:04] understand it is Christ hallelujah don't
[38:11] get me wrong when you're born again a
[38:14] major thing happens to you and when I
[38:17] say really born again I mean really born
[38:19] again but listen we talked about how God
[38:23] he hides himself in Paul was trying to
[38:27] tell us
[38:27] amen in Colossians how that these
[38:30] treasures of wisdom and knowledge is
[38:33] isn't hidden is hidden amen but then the
[38:37] Word of God tells us that is the Holy
[38:39] Ghost that leads and guides us into all
[38:43] truth you know what I mean she just like
[38:47] brother Branham didn't know who he was
[38:49] in the beginning you don't know who you
[38:52] are that's why the Prophet John said
[38:54] when the bride began to recognize who
[38:57] she is
[39:00] hallelujah and we're all that way amen
[39:04] in this journey hallelujah Oh God
[39:07] promised Abraham faced Abraham didn't
[39:09] realize what he had no he didn't look at
[39:13] all the mistakes he made before Abraham
[39:16] came to yield himself to God's purpose
[39:19] y'all heard that you've got to yield
[39:23] yourself to God's purpose hallelujah as
[39:29] long as you hold fast to yourself and
[39:32] don't yield you go get in trouble after
[39:36] trouble after
[39:37] laughter trouble until you finally
[39:40] realize you must die in rock the Bible
[39:51] says let no corrupt communication
[39:54] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[39:57] is good to the use of edifying that it
[40:00] may Minister grace unto the heroes
[40:03] hallelujah
[40:05] and grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby ye
[40:08] are sealed unto the day of redemption
[40:10] what every mistake you make God is your
[40:16] witness the Holy Ghost is your witness
[40:21] hallelujah is that right he couldn't be
[40:24] grieving wasn't there to witness it so
[40:28] you what are you saying every time you
[40:31] make a mistake if you don't feel a check
[40:33] if you're not grieved
[40:35] you're not one with him because when he
[40:39] grieves you grieve and it is grieving
[40:43] you repent and that repentance puts you
[40:47] back on track hallelujah let all
[40:52] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[40:53] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[40:56] from you with all malice it is the thing
[41:00] that kills the church y'all here but I'm
[41:03] saying that if these these are not
[41:06] attributes of life everything that I
[41:09] just spoken amen is a attribute of death
[41:13] and be kind one to another
[41:17] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[41:21] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[41:24] forgiven you you understand me
[41:27] forgiveness is not an option hallelujah
[41:31] to the true believer forgiveness oh let
[41:35] me read that again right and even God
[41:38] for listen says and be kind one to
[41:41] another tender-hearted forgiving one
[41:44] another even as God for Christ's sake
[41:49] not even
[41:50] your sake it's for Christ's sake that
[41:54] God forgives you for Christ's sake
[41:58] oh I'm well you're not worthy outside of
[42:01] Christ none of us deserve forgiveness
[42:06] except through and by Christ hallelujah
[42:11] forgiving one another even as God for
[42:14] Christ's sake hath forgiven you
[42:17] hallelujah and we remember the story in
[42:20] the Word of God
[42:21] the man who owned so much oh so much a
[42:24] man was asked for forgiveness a man and
[42:27] he was forgiven and then he had a
[42:28] servant a man who needed forgiving and
[42:31] instead of forgiving the servant he beat
[42:34] the servant and those who witnesses
[42:36] beating a man went back to the master
[42:39] and said listen this is what your
[42:41] servant did even though you forgave him
[42:43] he wouldn't forgive the other guy
[42:46] hallelujah and you know what the master
[42:49] did he took away all his forgiveness
[42:52] everything that he forgave the servants
[42:55] all amen he took it all away and the man
[42:59] who was beaten was in a Cabella
[43:00] condition tell you me that's how bad it
[43:07] is all these good things that God has
[43:10] done for us if you don't forgive at the
[43:13] end of the day everything that God
[43:16] promised you is stripped taken away from
[43:20] you
[43:20] somebody help me now Jesus spoke that
[43:23] you could believe it or not now
[43:26] you and I must understand amen listen as
[43:30] Hebrews 10:15 says we're of the Holy
[43:33] Ghost also is a witness to us for after
[43:37] that ye have said have had said before
[43:40] this is the Covenant that I will make
[43:43] with them after those days saith the
[43:45] Lord I will put my laws into their
[43:48] hearts and into their minds will I write
[43:51] them and their sins and iniquities will
[43:54] I remember no more now where remission
[43:58] of sin is there is no more offering for
[44:02] sin
[44:03] so you see why the devil don't want you
[44:06] to get into that place where you are in
[44:11] a place where there are no sins imputed
[44:14] to you whoo you don't have to believe it
[44:19] but the word says so blessed is the man
[44:22] whom God will not impute sin and the
[44:27] Word of God said this see remain it in
[44:29] you you cannot say these are secret
[44:35] things these are things that you and I
[44:37] must understand when we are sealed with
[44:39] the Holy Ghost that God comes along and
[44:42] says listen he's so justified I can't
[44:45] even see the sins that don't mean that
[44:50] you and I are gonna go around and do
[44:52] simple things I said well you know what
[44:54] that doesn't bother me it just shows
[44:56] that you're not born again there's no
[45:00] way a true Christian can do wrong and
[45:03] not be convicted hmm listen secret
[45:09] things secret things I you know I am I
[45:12] marvel at God that God Amen everybody
[45:15] thought that when Jesus died on the
[45:17] cross he was finished brother hallelujah
[45:20] perhaps the devil thought it in his mind
[45:22] oh how I got rid of him oh but on the
[45:27] day of Pentecost hallelujah yeah you
[45:31] know what it had been a burden for those
[45:33] priests they carry all those strolls
[45:35] around all those rolls around and then
[45:42] you know oh this one is over here this
[45:44] one is over there let me get this one
[45:46] hallelujah and then God Amen put it in
[45:50] one book everything and told John to eat
[45:55] it hallelujah and when John ate the book
[45:59] he became the book hallelujah and look
[46:05] at it John when he ate the book he
[46:06] didn't say Oh Lord I'm just so full the
[46:10] Bible said even getting the scream he
[46:11] began to holler
[46:12] he became the yeah hallelujah when he
[46:15] saw that his name
[46:16] in the muck Hey Oh everywhere heard John
[46:22] saying what's wrong with this quiet
[46:24] bride she's supposed to be a noisemaker
[46:33] hallelujah oh people of God you think
[46:36] God don't forgot about you no no no no
[46:38] no no you don't even know what's only
[46:40] inside of you the prophet of God said
[46:43] but when that pressure comes well when
[46:46] that pressure come you're gonna really
[46:47] see what you made out of hallelujah
[46:51] so I trust by the grace of God amen that
[46:53] was only inside is Christ God you got
[46:58] God will force a revival on you you see
[47:05] and everything mounting up against you

[47:32] let the fire go down the secret is God
[47:35] will come with you and how that you
[47:37] think not hallelujah then your Twitter
[47:42] says Daniel answered and said blessed be
[47:44] the name of God for ever and ever for
[47:47] wisdom and might are hears that's Daniel
[47:51] 20 22 22 and remember amen when the King
[47:55] he need the best shares or whatever his
[47:57] name was you know he won't eat you know
[47:59] he needed to understand what his dream
[48:02] was all about and God through Daniel
[48:06] interpreted to dream to him but this is
[48:11] one of the things that I love about
[48:12] Daniel he didn't say look at me I am the
[48:16] Prophet you know and and I told the King
[48:18] what he needs to know know then you knew
[48:21] where it came from and he said he
[48:24] changes the times and seasons
[48:27] go back danger element said blessed be
[48:29] the name of God forever and ever for
[48:32] wisdom and might are here and he changes
[48:35] the sign and the seasons he removeth
[48:38] kings and set it up kings he giveth
[48:41] wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to
[48:43] them that no understanding he revealeth
[48:47] the deep and secret things he knoweth
[48:53] what it is in the what is in the
[48:55] darkness and light dwelleth with him

[49:07] will reveal it by way of his servants of
[49:10] profit right hallelujah that's what his
[49:14] cut y'all come on somebody brother
[49:16] branham purpose was to reveal the deep
[49:20] things of God and what was in the
[49:23] darkness that's what this message
[49:27] reveals to us and you and I must
[49:30] understand it wasn't just a little
[49:33] Kentuckian it was godlike it wasn't
[49:35] Daniel like it was in Jeremiah Amen and
[49:40] all the other prophets hallelujah but
[49:43] what did he come to do just like he
[49:46] revealed to the king he meant seven
[49:49] years of prosperity seven years of
[49:51] famine prepare yourself
[49:53] hallelujah and that's what the Prophet
[49:56] did to us he said listen when I leave
[49:59] off the scene hallelujah it's going to
[50:02] get worse but prepare yourself
[50:06] hallelujah it's going to become a famine
[50:09] even in the message this message is not
[50:12] the famine but the preachers they won't
[50:15] get the people to the Holy Ghost and
[50:18] without the Holy Ghost you have no
[50:20] fruits you have no line you have nothing
[50:25] hallelujah but dried up pretty people
[50:33] his secret from God
[50:37] drop everything whatever you do you make
[50:40] sure you get the Holy Ghost you make
[50:43] sure you get the token nothing is more
[50:46] important than the token whatever you do
[50:49] get it there's another time to assume
[50:52] you will not make a rapture assuming at
[50:57] the end of the day all you go you won't
[51:00] be able to say oh my god I thought I had
[51:02] it
[51:02] the Bible says make your calling and
[51:05] election sure making sure now well you
[51:09] have a chance but the devil makes you
[51:14] stink if the Holy Ghost is just jumping
[51:16] and shouting and dancing thank God for a
[51:18] prophet hallelujah that brought it down
[51:21] it says listen this birth is just not a
[51:24] feeling it's a life it is the very life
[51:28] of God in you and he said in that day
[51:31] the Word of God said in that day you
[51:32] will know Jesus said that I'm in the
[51:34] father the father is in me and I am in
[51:36] you and if you're not certain he's yeah
[51:38] you better make sure it doesn't matter
[51:41] what it takes hallelujah understand it
[51:45] is God who has chosen you do you really
[51:48] believe you chosen I believe I am
[51:51] hallelujah
[51:52] you know Abraham didn't have a
[51:54] circumcision at the first he had he was
[51:57] chosen elected then he was circumcised
[51:59] hallelujah you may not get the whole
[52:01] egos write-off but you know when you
[52:03] know that you heard his voice you follow
[52:06] the voice and God will bring you to the
[52:09] purpose hallelujah think about it we're
[52:14] in a battle we're in a battle is that
[52:17] right and every military has secret
[52:21] weapons some they call classified that
[52:26] everybody don't know you might be an
[52:29] army but there are certain people that
[52:31] know certain things that you don't know
[52:33] uh because it classified and God has
[52:38] classified secrets available only to the
[52:43] authorized persons see everybody can't
[52:46] get this revelation it's only given to
[52:49] the authorized
[52:51] hallelujah amen amen amen
[52:56] listen you and I must understand Amen
[52:59] that when God even gives us these things
[53:01] it is given to us to keep it in a secret
[53:05] place is that right
[53:10] God gave Samson's classified information
[53:14] and that classified information was
[53:17] concerning himself if you want to remain
[53:20] strong and powerful never let the locks
[53:24] of your hair be cut off hallelujah
[53:27] come on somebody if you want your
[53:31] strength to remain never let the locks
[53:35] of your hair be cut off y'all hear me
[53:39] don't let the devil stop you at
[53:41] temperance don't let him stop you at
[53:46] patience don't even let him stop you
[53:48] have brotherly kindness you and I must
[53:51] go all the way to divine love to
[53:54] experience the power and strength of the
[53:57] Holy Ghost y'all know how that works a
[54:01] special class of people you don't
[54:03] believe it brother Browns here you will
[54:06] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[54:08] of this message that this book we are
[54:10] studying is the actual revelation of
[54:12] Jesus himself in the church and his work
[54:16] in the future ages then I mentioned that
[54:19] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us a
[54:21] revelation or we will fail to get it
[54:24] hello that's what's wrong with people
[54:27] that's why they've fallen away that's
[54:29] why they dry it up they just thought
[54:31] they had the emotion experience but
[54:33] never had a change of heart let me tell
[54:36] you something God knows when you
[54:38] surrender everything I don't care if
[54:43] it's a speck of the world if you don't
[54:45] surrender it you won't get it hmm that's
[54:52] words of your prophet he said if a speck
[54:54] of the world is in you you do not know
[54:58] God
[54:59] whoo we have a intellectual
[55:03] understanding then I mentioned that it
[55:08] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[55:09] revelation or we will fail to get
[55:11] bringing these two thoughts together you
[55:13] will see that it won't take just
[55:15] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[55:18] book real anybody who can I get a
[55:21] witness can I get away hallelujah
[55:25] man if that's all it took the
[55:27] intellectual put us into a shame
[55:31] hallelujah
[55:32] but thank God the Bible said these signs
[55:35] shall follow them that believe
[55:38] hallelujah it is good it is going to
[55:41] take the operation of the Holy Ghost
[55:43] that means this book can't be revealed
[55:45] to anyone but a special class of people
[55:49] it would take one with profit insight it
[55:53] would require the ability to hear from
[55:55] God it will require supernatural
[55:57] instruction not just a student comparing
[56:00] version with verses though that is good
[56:02] but a mystery cause the teaching of the
[56:06] Spirit will never become clear how we
[56:09] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[56:12] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[56:15] hear and know that's the only way
[56:18] yielded to the spirit to hear and know I
[56:23] have already said this book revelation
[56:26] it's the consummation of the scripture
[56:28] it is even placed exactly right in the
[56:30] Canon of the scripture at the end now
[56:33] you you can know why it says that anyone
[56:36] who reads or even hears it is blessed
[56:39] hmm why because there's so many people
[56:42] said what this book is not for us it is
[56:44] not for the church even when I was in
[56:46] denomination is you to tell me he is not
[56:48] for the church but what it was they
[56:50] didn't understand it they would probably
[56:53] wish to cut it out what would it be for
[56:55] if it's not for the charges DEP made for
[56:58] the Jews hallelujah is for those who are
[57:03] blessed so how can you think your cars
[57:06] if you bless it you can hear it you can
[57:10] receive it hallelujah but the problem is
[57:12] God is you and I we must yield to his
[57:17] purpose but the sad thing about it is
[57:20] because the devil God is so busy in this
[57:22] world we got too many things is that
[57:24] right
[57:25] that's what Jesus told us that the cares
[57:27] of this world would choke the life out
[57:29] of you
[57:29] whew too many cares remember I said last
[57:34] week yesterday uh the busy means what
[57:37] burden under Satan's yoke huh burden
[57:44] under Satan's yoke he's got you when
[57:49] you're too busy to get with God somebody
[57:54] help me there is nothing of such
[57:57] prevailing power let me move up and you
[58:00] can see why they who who would add or
[58:02] take away from it would be cursed it
[58:04] would have to be so for who can add or
[58:07] take away from the perfect revelation of
[58:09] God and overcome the enemy huh who can
[58:13] take away from the perfect revelation of
[58:16] God and overcome you cannot oh you don't
[58:20] need you don't need the Holy Ghost you
[58:22] won't if you won't defeat the devil
[58:25] hallelujah oh you don't you don't need
[58:28] the travail you won't get the hope you
[58:30] won't you won't overcome every birth is
[58:34] a mess I'm not talking when you say Oh
[58:37] Lord I receive you into my heart that
[58:39] was conception but there comes a real
