========================================
amen we're just going to get right into the word of God would like to say by the grace of God oh thank you amen we appreciate the Lord amen amen amen I thought I had said or done I don't know amen I appreciate that thank you surely God is good to us you know and uh but let us turn to Malachi 3 6 we'll read the sixth and seventh verse and then we'll go to Leviticus 25 Malachi 3 6 and 7th verses we love the Lord my book at home uh something I want to share with you and I will I will but it would have been nice if you could see um basically what I was working with but uh let's read Malachi 3:6 for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed even from the days of your father ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you sayeth the Lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return let us go to Leviticus 25 surely God is good to us what can we say Amen we're going to read the 25th uh chapter of Leviticus start with the ninth verse and we'll read down to the 15th verse if that's okay let's start at the eth verse and thou shalt number seven Sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of seven Sabbath of years shall be unto thee 4 and9 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that that 50th year be unto you you should not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy Vine undressed for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field for in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession and if thou shall ought unto thy neighbor and buth ought of thy neighbor's hand ye shall not oppress one another according to the number of years after the Jubilee Thou shalt buy of thy neighbor and according unto thy neighbor and according unto the number of the years of the fruit he shall sell unto thee let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you in your lovely name we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your Divine love that you have bestowed upon us and father I pray that you have bless the service here tonight give us our our eyes to see and ears to hear Lord granted in the name of Jesus Christ give us also a heart to receive and Lord we bless your name in Jesus Christ Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen I I found a book today and I was working with uh the 50th uh the Jubilee uh we were having dinner uh brother Keith and I with brother RI and he was mentioning that last night and somehow it kind of stuck with me and uh you know um I I I found a nice book and I have to share that later but then I I went to the bonds and noas over University today trying to find that book I looked everywhere in places I thought would be the book and um in places that perhaps it would not have been but you know uh sometimes they stick things where uh it shouldn't be but nevertheless it was a new book and I figured you know maybe uh you know I was looking in the sports section and everywhere even on the new books table and you know because um all I needed to see was the Queen of England because basically they're celebrating uh a 50th year anniversary and uh uh as a queen I believe it is um but nevertheless amen they're celebrating and her name is Elizabeth so I I there were some things I kind of wanted to look up under that and did get a chance to do it but in the book that I did receive or did buy uh it's it's basically talking about 1963 and the change of America and you know it it uh it it says amen like on the third or fourth page of the book celebrating the first modern president and of course uh President John Kennedy was the youngest president ever elected during that time and you might wonder why I'm bringing this up because they're now celebrating this 50th year of of uh this uh president and his wife and in the book they've got uh several things going on they talk about during this time it was the new frontier in space and we realize that because brother brandham talk about the Sputnik and and all of them running to the moon and all of that stuff stuff but we understand by the grace of God brother Brandon brought the spiritual application out of that and showed amen that we were now entering in what you call the space age or the bride age amen because we know that the eagle is not a Earthbound bird so so many things were happening in that time uh the Cold War and Peace and y'all remember the cubic crisis well some of y'all don't but I do amen and you know how uh things went on how things became glamorous in the 1963 women really excelled in Beauty uh because of cosmetics and all of this other kind of stuff The Cutting of the hair and whatever more they did uh do to themselves amen and we understand even in that uh uh time the that uh our president uh Kennedy was uh assassinated now a lot of these things you probably wondering why I'm bringing to the Forefront um it's because these things happened to America because we rejected the gospel brother Brandon preached a message uh Jubilee and he also preached another message return to Jubilee and he was there in Louisiana when he preached this message message and he talked about the Holy Ghost falling in such a powerful way down in Louisiana and and he's now rebuking the same church that the Holy Ghost once had leadership over and he was telling them how they had left uh their first love and now they have become worldly and uh you know but he he goes on to say uh how that they what they used to be you know and when we see uh the world moving one way we find out that the church began to move too because in the 60s the Industrial Age and and the roads and and everything began to uh really multiply and the people began to multiply and the reason why is because God had already staged this thing and and though the Baby Boomers look like it would have been a problem they began to multiply multiply and multiply amen because amen and with the riches amen now we see uh those who were once poor moving into the middle class amen and you got to understand that a country is judged by the church right however the church is behaving it is what what it is the thing that brings God's judgment y'all hear what I'm saying and uh you know I learned that I think brother Keith and I were talking and he brought something like that up and I I had never seen it before someone who I was talking with and I thought that is so true you know because I realize amen God only cares about his own his own's behavor is that all right now I want you to understand this Sodom and gomor always existed and God never judged them but when lot went down and his crew is that right and conformed to that lifestyle then God was upset amen that's the way it goes if the church would have held their grounds in the 60s America as we know it would not be the way it is now but because we got worldly now God is upset amen come on somebody he's upset amen with America let's put it the way God is upset with the world because the Bible said that if the salt had lost had if the salt loses savior what good is it if if the Christian lose their strength and their power what good is it amen the thing that I love the Bible says I am the Lord and I change not that means what he did yesterday he'll do again today y'all hear what I'm saying see we you know you say well I believe that that that uh uh this city uh is blessed because we're here and as long as this little Fellowship holds the standard of Holiness the Judgment of God cannot fall on this city it is only when we began to compromise and began to get become worldly God then takes judgment where first on the church because the Bible said that judgment begins at the house of God and then where will the Sinner and the ungodly appear see God Amen looks at us because you got to realize amen the serpent was already always in the garden right he was as evil as he ever was but he never was judged until he contaminated Adam and Eve then judgment came is that right see so you got to understand we are the preservers Hallelujah he changes not Israel was a prosperous Nation right God couldn't curse Israel because amen she was prosperous she was blessed but when balam came and said that listen you and Moab are the same and Israel believed that and then began to move into that channel then God judged Israel with Moab amen see what I'm saying so look the Bible tells us according to Isaiah 45:22 look unto me and be ye shaved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else hello there's none else remember of the for former things of old now if we can look at the former things of old we can see how God is when it comes to his people yes sir as long as we hold our ground hey come on somebody it's like that even in our own families it's like that on your job if you work diligently on your job and hold a Christian standard don't you know your job will be blessed amen because God is going to bless you amen so in order to bless you he's got to bless your job amen amen so wherever you don't believe that that's true that is so true Egypt never was as blessed as they were when Joseph came through Hallelujah Joseph Egypt blessed the whole of Joseph I mean God blessed the whole of Egypt because of Joseph amen and a lot of time God the don't want you placees because wherever you go it becomes blessed so he gives you a hard time Hallelujah ain't God good to us listen I want you to understand because you got to understand we are now looking at the 50th year of this message hello this is a Year of Jubilee all the fighters practically are dead amen come on somebody all of the fighters are practically dead all of those who caused camps in this message those who broke up Brotherhood and change things for their own benefit are dead we don't have to worry about this Doctrine and that Doctrine and this Doctrine now amen we're getting ready to see the waters overflow amen y'all hear what I'm saying sir the prophet of God tells us amen that those little ducklings they wanted to Fellowship but they couldn't Fellowship because of the the wall of the fence he said but when it came a flood oh it lifted them up and they got together amen so now that the enemy now that the fighters are dead it's about time to cross the Jordan amen but understand the Jordan can't be crossable until the flood waters are ready flood waters represent people that's right until the squeeze come on somebody it has to be crossed over at a time when the blood waters are great amen good amen oh it won't be easy see that's what it is a lot of times people think it's going to be easy but I tell you what we got Joshua leading us hallelujah we've got Joshua leading us and he's got the instruction so do we amen is that okay I want you to understand what the Jubilee is about some of us we've heard this a minute times but you know I want you to understand what why Kennedy had to be first of all let me go back up Kennedy had to be voted president he had to be because he was a Catholic and the Catholic church has to rule America right so God had to use a man like brother bam said they used to sneak through the back door but once Kennedy became president they started coming through the front door now guess what America in 50 years has now become a Catholic Nation that's right amen hello and brother bman 50 years ago said Jezebel was the one that was ruling huh not Miss Kennedy the woman that was greater than Miss Kennedy which was the Catholic church right he said basically that all President Kennedy was was a pond or a puppet in her hands and all of the presidents afterwards amen whenever uh H the Sabbath or the year Jubilee was so important it was precious and if if I we we have seen in history what happened to Israel and I think uh I forgot what brother brought this out which was so true Israel failed to keep the Sabbath of God for 4 90 years that's how corrupt they had become 490 years of neglect that's 70 sabbaths and because they fail to keep God's Sabbath God said I'm going to judge you and I'm going to let Babylon take you into judgment and you're going the land will rest for 70 years the same Sabbath you didn't give I'm I'm going to take it from you amen amen huh and that's what God did to Israel and that's what God will do to us amen whenever we fail to enter into the Sabbath amen there is a judgment now let me explain to you because this message is our Sabbath hello it is the entrance into our rest and that's what Paul according to Hebrews say labor to enter it that's what I can't get over you can't go by by bypass Paul's word he said labor to enter into your rest amen hallelujah your Jubilee come on somebody because we have come seven Church ages oh come on somebody and realized by the grace of God when God came and the Holy Ghost returned which was the token life it was for you and I to enter into it failure to enter into it will cause judgment yes sir amen is that right remember when they were when the Year of Jubilee sounded that mean you can go free you drop your hole you drop your rake wherever you were I mean that me you can go free but now in you if you're in the wall City you can't hear it right right so what happened was God before he sounded the Jubilee trumpet he made sure that those who were in The W those who were not elected were in the wall City they had already rejected the message of their age but when the seals were broken they couldn't hear it's time for you to go free now watch this because even in the time when uh uh in in in 1963 when when the word was opened we've got to realize that this was a now a new generation the old generation perished in the wilderness yes they did but now this thing repeats itself right because we find out Israel and Israel is a sure example right Joshua never pointed the people to himself he always pointed them to God and God made sure Joshua know knew he was in control that God was in control and Joshua was just a servant of the Lord that's right Amen brother bandam tells us that this Jubilee trumpet can only be heard by children because it is the children who hears the voice of return amen come on somebody if you're a servant you don't even understand it but if you a son or daughter that means you can go free because you're the one with the inheritance oh my Lord you're the one that has the inheritance whether it be housing or land or children or what because in 50 years often time you got in trouble sometime financially and you had to become the borrower instead of the lender and there were times amen that you you had to lot off of pro part of your property or something just to pay somebody else off but when that Year of Jubilee came that meant everything was released amen now if you had become a slave because of of something your parent had done or whatever the case may be amen uh you had a right to go free amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying but if you loved your master y'all know the story if you loved your Taskmaster and didn't want to go free hello if you love the demon that have you enslaved and you don't want to go free come on somebody then what God will do was bore your ear and that means that trumpet will never be sounded for you again and you'll go straight to wherever you going with that demon enslaving you because you made a choice of not going free it's 50 years now this is the Jubilee year of the message we have heard and we have seen our inheritance we know we're Sons but it's still up to you amen your desire to go free amen come on somebody right you see God ain't dwelling in a group of CH a crowd God doesn't dwell in a crowd God dwells in a humble heart you as an individual you must hear this sound you must know you can go free why what good is this message to us if it's not going to declare our Liberty amen Jesus declared I've come to set the captive [Music] free I was thinking how those who were under the prophets Ministry they saw the son of man but they missed the coming of Christ and that's why so many people are stumbling you know I was telling somebody today cuz you know all those rumors and stuff going about the dates and all that I say what who care I don't need to investigate any of that I don't care about dates whether it was here there or Yonder I don't care I know where it is now I could care less if he if he if he hunted on a on a day that that the law said listen didn't Jesus disciples eat cor that's right am didn't they go in somebody else's field who's who who's who's ahead of all of these laws Hallelujah God is God is not bound by law not man's law anyhow you know it it just crazy St say brother why would you investigate I said it makes no difference to me I'm I'm too sold out brother I could care less what kind of evidence they can come up with and you know it was a come on how can you ever to me is Blas blemy and you know what brother brandom said to reject the message of your day is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost he said to come into the knowledge of Truth and rejected is blasphemy help us Lord listen and think about it on that seventh day which is the Sabbath rest don't you know or that seventh year they were not supposed to plant the land was supposed to rest right I love that why because man had no no no no uh put it this way but it didn't stop the seeds from growing amen the seeds grew up itself because they were already planted amen so what are you saying I'm saying that Sabbath year takes Man Hands away from labor but it puts it all in the hands of God woo come on somebody you see and that's what this message has done to us is taking our hands off of it and it's now plac it in the hands of God and you and I don't have to worry about the seed because the seed will be planted and God has already planted and on the Sabbath God will cause it the water to be increased and everything God Amen and the Bible tells us amen that that that uh on that Sabbath year that that year of rest when the when they didn't the farmers didn't have to plant or they didn't have to prune nothing he said that Harvest or that that that those seeds that would grow of itself was for everybody if you were poor it if you was rich come on somebody amen if you was a stranger if you was a cattle if you was a beast if you was a servant you can go and you can Feast off the field ain't that what the bride for come on somebody the bride amen is God increase amen now I don't understand it but I look at these things and I find out that the people of God have such a strong um how can I say it they have a problem I was telling somebody I said you know what I said so many people have seen brother brandham and they failed to see Elijah now I want you to understand the spirit of Elijah was God God himself the spirit of Elijah is the Holy Ghost himself amen they said well the spirit of Elijah came five times it's still the Holy Ghost yes sir amen it ain't no you get to heaven ain't going to be no Spirit of Elijah it's going to be the Holy Ghost Amen in in that spir or in that Ministry he called Elijah amen the only difference between the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Moses is the name that God call him and what the ministry is to do it's still the Holy Ghost Moses going to have to have the Holy Ghost and Elijah will too Moses will do the ministry of Moses and Elijah would do the ministry of Elijah but it'll still be the same God Amen in different offices that's all you know people want to make it so difficult it ain't nothing difficult about it amen call it the son of man or the the Son of God or the Holy Ghost is still God it's him ain't one two or three same God working in a different dispensation that's it but that's what happened that's why when the man William Brandon would say something humanistic or something that a human would do or do something and they said well Elijah made a mistake Elijah didn't make a mistake Elijah was God when God spoke through the man it never was a mistake amen but brother brandom still was a man right many times he said I'm waiting on him him who Elijah yes sir God how you I don't understand that why people get so confused I said the problem is they kept seeing Elijah I mean uh brother brandham and not not seeing the spirit behind him that was the difference between Joshua and Caleb Joshua and Caleb could see Moses yet they could see God behind Moses that's right that's why they didn't get confused all this man no they knew it was God behind the [Music] veil they saw Moses when he got upset but they knew that was Moses amen come on somebody didn't that brother BR tried to tell us he said when Elijah said Lord send down the fire he said that was a man's spirit but God being that it was God's Prophet God honored it when God got Elijah got mad at those uh those children called saying go up you Baldhead go up you Baldhead and he said that bear came to eat him up he said that that was that was a man getting upset that's why when his disciples in the New Testament said Lord call S down the fire Jesus said you don't know what Spirit you are see and that's what people don't understand I said all they got to do is get the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you ain't going to have a problem with this message that's right you'll know it's the right you'll know and understand it's right you're not going to struggle with it just like I tell people I said they still lying on Jesus they still saying Amen in the Jewish Community somebody came by and stole his body what you going to believe the word or or some lie you know you look at these things I'm just saying now because I want you to understand the only way and come on people let's deal with reality we're not where we should be but you know what has happened this message got cooled off they got lazy things got easy right the persecutions practically stopped there was a time am me oh I you follow a prophet you know you were persecuted you were really ridicule but now we blending in come on somebody and I'm going get to something in just a moment listen it took a mighty Russian win then it's going to take a mighty Russian win now amen the same holy ghost that fell on the zusu street oh you think they got it easy do you really think they got it easily no sir no sir brother bham said this like this he said um he said the persecution always gives strength to the church he said we've had it too easy we get slothful we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything just handed to us it takes sorrows and tears and sweat and prayer and Faith amen and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Ghost I'm going to say it again it takes sorrows and te tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Ghost the Zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies I'm afraid if the windows would be shut out tonight CU he talked about it he talked about it in a a paragraph above he said in the olden days he said he T people would come in and shoot into the windows of the services and the bullets would bounce off the people wouldn't even hurt them he said but I'm so afraid now oh he said listen he said listen he said I'm afraid if the windows would be shut out tonight people run everywhere and never come back again and he's telling the truth they'll run and not come back again and even in the organization I came out of they had the same kind of experience of a husband getting mad with his wife come to church and while they worshiping he's shooting and they find bullets at the end of the service on the floor nobody was pierced or hurt because they were so under the anointing of God hallelujah and I'm telling you that makes me jealous to know that even under that inspiration they had the power of God and Satan couldn't penetrate that's the real Holy Ghost that's what we got to have here this little service that we be having and everybody complacent with it is not good enough for me I want to see God the pillar of fire moving this place heal and deliver every soul in here but it can't be done by the pastor one or two it's got to be Unity we've got to all desire the same thing that's how the Holy Ghost came on the day of pity because 120 people got together there's not 120 people in here and if they could do it we can do it amen but we going to have to all chip in on this thing you know join together as a body and just seek God with all our with our whole face Desiring God to come in this place like he's never done it before is that right God did not send this place this this uh he did not send me here amen just just to minister to people who going to be missed or lost or or or left behind amen this is our Jubilee this is our time our fear that if we wait to next year it might be closed am there's not another church age after us amen after the first Jubilee amen 1906 to 1956 what happened God came along is that right a new message was beginning America rejected rejected her Jubilee judgment came down the woes of of Tri of of of uh Revelation fell by Rock and Roll by War all the Wes come right down plague the people cancer tuberculosis all these things fell because America amen rejected the gospel and the church that started on theu Street had now organized and had become worldly and God judged the world because of the church amen and now we come to it again look at the message we in bad shape as a whole come on all over the world we got churches up there in Minnesota that won't even fellowship with each other because of some silliness come on somebody it's true I mean not just there in everywhere you go it's the same nonsense and we look at denomination as if they're the ones that that had problems we got problems the same Devils that was in Egypt and followed us out here and we're doing the same thing it's going to take somebody somewhere to raise up a standard cuz the Bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood amen God will lift up a standard there got to be somebody amen that's going to lift up a standard and tell them listen you've been wrong it's time to get up out of here but if you're in a wall City if you in a city or you that's why I don't want nobody to think I'm so great because there are so many people who believe that they're in this message that if they leave certain churches because of the pastor's way of Ministry they can't be saved or won't make a Rapture nonsense that's what denomination teaches amen and in this message that's exactly where it is because of the way people preaches and you know because of their deliverances people have now raised up uh uh uh Dayan and corus it won't be here my point is people of God there's no way that we can sit still with our souls hanging in the balance Jubilee year was a serious year you either stayed with your slave master or you got free now the the trumpet is blowing tonight what you going to do about it every one of us got some demons to be loosed and freed from hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody I don't care if it's just a small demon amen that's right amen it's got to go leave everything behind drop it you say I don't know how to I don't know how to get free listen I'm holding this book this book ain't holding me I'm holding it amen in reality a demon ain't holding you you hold holding it [Music] come on somebody cuz he ain't nothing but a squat on your land and you letting him stay there you got to enforcer who is the Holy Ghost oh come on somebody is that right oh you see what brother was where's that in the word first of all you can go to Joel God said all that the the years that the pomor the cankerworm the Locust and the caterpillars eaten away from you bride tree I shall rest that means I shall restore amen and restore means to bring back to its original state of being God said I shall restore amen that's a law of God Amen he promise he restore it that's what he's trying to do now through the message of the hour restore us back to our original state amen but Lon let me tell you something that it doesn't make any difference I I I I heard the prophet of God said like this without the holy ghost in a church you're just a Blasphemous name you claim to be something that you're not huh yeah go listen go go go listen to uh uh the bride tree and hear some of the things he say on that restoration of the Bride tree it'll blow your mind amen because he realized you got you and I we can't just leave stay here in this position right you say oh brother why listen he goes on to say he said God's laws everything is set upon God's laws is that right everything is set upon God's law he said listen he said it doesn't matter what death caus during the winter the law of God said when the Sun and the Earth come into Unity again or alignment God will cause those things that were dead to come back to life amen and he said at that Springtime he said that's that's that seed juvilee it was in prison it was dead it was held by death Hallelujah but when the Sun s o in strikes it it's got to come God will restore and that's the problem he said he said as long as we are away from him we we're in the winter time we're in the fall time as long as we're away from him that seed will lay there dead it might break open it might spew out he said but if you come back to God you return back to God like the Earth returns back to the sun amen and that son causes everything that was dead to come back to life amen so the problem is not with the Sun the problem is with the Earth coming back in alignment coming back around and getting closer the closer you get to him the harder you get Hallelujah that's a law he said what what he said restore what the winter kills when the Earth get back in that position right see what I'm saying and I wrote down here the sun shall rise on thee that sleep and I love that because if if if the son if if that's not true uh in nature the law of nature proves the resurrection you see what I'm saying the laws of nature proves the resurrection and God set that law that we might be it might be visibly seen because you and I we can look through a seed all day and never find the life right a dog can't tell me how I feel unless he's born a man and you can't understand what a Son of God is until you born a Son of God right so those law are out there for us but this is our Jubilee and what did the prophet of God say when he left off the scene lay in the presence of the son so that you can be what ripened amen took it right back to the S so n and the Su in because that's the only place you can get right right in the word of God right in hearing he said that's why he said when you see that they approach and come together the more don't slack off like a lot of people they follow way and don't even know it a lot of people don't even know what year we in this is a serious year do you really think amen that this is coincident that the very day and time and and month the seals being open fell on the same time day and month the same 50 years later but now the house of God means what the house of God is going to be judged amen you'll be judged if you don't go free if you don't get a desperation yes sir amen and I'll be honest with you if I heard a jubilee sound and I was a slave do you think I won't even consult the master oh it's gone amen and you think I'm going to walk oh I'm on my way home no sir I'm a run and that's what God saying we ought to be excited about our inheritance what is our inheritance everything it's everything the devil know he's your slave the devil knows he's under you am we must learn he's under us it take consecration folks like I said Blood Sweat and Tears it does that's right it's going to take some serious serious getting down to prayer hallelujah amen he said listen that is him the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit the spirit of God that comes in power and Resurrection to prove that Jesus Christ is not dead but he's alive and ready to return for his church he said in this day they still saying who is this whenever we've ever had a service it's been a long time we've had such a service where the Holy Ghost is in in in complete control and people shouting and dancing and running and and and you know you say that ain't all it but that's a part of it and it's good when it comes when God just comes in and just you know when I was up in New Jersey my wife would tell you it came through the church in waves so don't tell me it doesn't exist and don't tell me it's all over but there's a people up there in New York know they can't survive without prayer hello they're not like here in Demon where things see so laxy Daisy they have to stay in the anointing and presence of God us to be saved in New York Hallelujah so they call on God and they get results but that doesn't stop us from calling on God one of the worst things you can do is wait till your gas tank get empty to try to fill it up it's empty it's on empty and you praying oh Lord help me no uhh especially when you got money to fill it up you don't wait till it get empty on E I've done it before and I'm like oh Lord help me but that's not a good time to get it filled it's when you see a half tank or whatever and you got a station that's convenient get it done am I making sense you don't want oh Lord feel me now I'm on empty you should never as a Christian allow yourself to become empty amen that's what he said this spirit is coming and instead even in this little church we don't have enough fellowship with one another everybody got their own little clicks and that's wrong people I'm telling you it's wrong you and I when God put us all here to be perfected there are things amen about you that you that uh I might not like and things about me that you might not like but God said you you Fellowship amen that's what it's all about it is to cut and and to break off and to get off those don't like things out because you and I got to love each other and we going to be spending eternity with each other anyhow hello somebody we don't do enough of it here come on we try to have little GI togethers and everybody got their personal issues and going this way and going that way and don't even know that those little personal those little fellowships are ordained by God come together the more don't mean that you got to have church all the time come together the more to Fellowship to learn of each other come on somebody God took 12 hard heads put them all together and say you're my disciples learn how to deal with it and they didn't always get alone hello and they were always different ones in competition even at the Holy Ghost they still had problems Lord amen but that's who God chose hello Unity Unity is more than just sitting together in church say we going to the same assembly we're family and we're more blood related with each other than we are with our natural fam at least that's the way it's supposed to be Ezekiel 23 please and I'm not I'm going cut on this CU I'll finish this off later I'm talking about Jubilee how and I'm going to tell you something people you know what it is it's the lack of the Holy Ghost that's the problem here and the problem everywhere is the lack of the Holy Ghost cuz when the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost there ain't no way the Holy Ghost ain't going to put it this way cause you to love and to feel compassion for your brothers and sisters they ain't going to it ain't going to happen and all of us are guilty all of us are guilty Ezekiel 23 Perfection comes by by trials you don't even know you love me until I get on your nerve that's true it's the truth I mean you got you know how I'm going to know that if we don't you know we don't Fellowship you know it's those little things that you God put there so that you can come to understand that there's still something in US Satan can work with we got to get rid of all of that we really do we got to get rid of all of that that don't protect you the Holy Ghost is your protection it ain't what you do or how you it's the Holy Ghost brother said I sin all the time he said he said I'll never be perfect he said but I'm trusting in the perfect one he said what it is and that that's in in in rest uh I forgot I think that's uh the same one but he talks about he says listen in in in uh listen to the rest okay uh I'm getting mixed up in my message because I listen to several but he talks about it people he talks about it he said but when you make confess and make he said when you make a mistake and make it right he said that's what God looks at Ezekiel 23 and4 and we're going to close on this okay we're not going to be long tonight but my point is people what's going to happen this is your Jubilee 50 years this is 2016 2013 excuse me and here we are since 19 uh uh 63 50 years is 2013 that's right so now this is our Jubilee brother talks about it in 1965 he said a bride a vir a bride has been born the the stars in the heavens declared us so it ain't that if we on Earth we are on earth amen the bride is here right and if she's here that means Christ is here uniting with his bride amen hallelujah I still Marvel at brother brandom that he can be with people or talk with people who he knew hate him oh I love you brother brandom and the whole time he Hearing in his head I can't stand you I mean something on that effect and it must have heard him but you never hear him say that was the Christ that was the Christ in it Hallelujah having patience and longsuffering is not easy but it's it's ordained for us to do it Ezekiel 23 and4 you love the Lord amen we all people there's it's so much growth it's so much listen that God you know why I'm I'm preaching like this because we don't understand how Satan works on me there times he said well they a you don't see no growth ain't nothing happen you wasting your time and I know better I know it's the devil because you know I just like the Lord say then you know if you can't see no growth you it's like looking at a tree like I said can you see a tree growing that's my answer to the devil you see because a tree grow right in your face and you don't see it amen right and you're growing you may not see it but you're growing oh it's true it's true it's true amen God in the inside is changing you little by little by little know he's changing me I've seen the difference I've Marvel at the difference cuz I know I couldn't do it I know I couldn't do it Ezekiel 23 and4 you love the Lord amen I'm going read the first verse the word of the Lord came again unto me saying son a man there were two women the daughters of one mother and they committed whoredom in Egypt they committed whoredom in their youth they were their breast pressed and they were they bruised the teeths of their virginity and I know that sound rough and the names of them were aholah the Elder and holah her sister and they were mine and they were bear Sons and Daughters thus where their name Samaria is aola and Jerusalem aah and what it was amen these sisters it was the northern kingdom and the southern Kingdom of Israel and what they had done is what they what the what we've done I put it this way it's no difference I mean we might call ourselves Jerusalem but look what the Gentile church has done she's done the same thing Israel has and what happened was a whole uh uh Samaria amen what she did she uh uh uh uh basically went out of whing with all of the soldiers and everything else and then you know what what was so bad you think that Jerusalem would have been able to look at Samaria and say listen we're not going to do that but it represented Judah and she not only did that but she United with them she made an ally with them she became amen what you say the World Council of churches and she flirted and did all of these things and listen God judged them hello God judged them and my point is you and I can't flirt with the world not even flirt but say God ain't taking no flirters we can't flirt with the world now how many of us flirt at times oh so we need to God God to deliver us this is our year Jubilee take away the flirting of spirit Lord they were really harshly judged why because God God is a jealous God he'll never have a god before him I don't care what it is God will not have another God before him and whether you out there committing some H horrible sin or not it doesn't matter because idolatry can come in a small package amen huh Rachel HD her daddy's idols huh where in a place you see what I'm saying and it's show by the grace of God that it is so easy to even idolize yourself he said I don't do that yes we do when God command us and car ask us to do things and we don't feel like it then you become your God because you have your will have superseded the will of God you yourself have become the idol oh come on somebody it's true anyhow and what is it now you and I got something to fight we've got to fight what we call the message spirit that old lukewarm and didn't that that brother brought it he brought it lukewarmness is not in a good place to be you and a being lukewarm you put God in a place where he gets sick and want to throw you up spew you out right he said I would you be cold cold ain't a good place either cuz if you cold you going to miss the Rapture amen you might not be spew out but listen if you cold you going to miss the Rapture but the good thing about cold at least you know you're not hot amen that's true you know your situation you know where you're stand but when you're hot come on somebody and you and I must become Z is for God you can't do it without the Holy Ghost not the full kind of zous uh that God wants am I making sense this is our time you say well brother books I I want Deliverance really do we really want Deliverance do we really want God to help us well let me tell you something brother B said if you don't get desperate it'll pass right through you and you won't know it something God is sending he said well brother I don't know how to get desperate you know how to pray amen we know how to pray and prayer is Lord make if you want God you want to be desperate Lord Make Me desperate you better know what you're praying but if that's the only way you can get desperate pray it because desperation is the only thing that's going to get us out of here am I making sense now my point is this amen when we see how God comes along and he tears up Israel he judges them and Titus and you know all of these things that we see happened to Jerusalem was only because of their re their rebellion and their rejection of the prophets and the prophets and the prophets the word was constantly coming to her warning her and warning her like here and they constantly rejected they constantly didn't take the prophet seriously and so when judgment came it shouldn't have taken them by surprise cuz the prophet said the Judgment was coming am I making sense see I I I just oh I could tell you like this and I I I know I'm not speaking only for myself I can't stand lukewarmness I can't stand it when I can't even be free in my own assembly because I feel the the downpour Lord am I I'm the one one about I know I'm not you feel that downpour when you trying to go up but you feel a downpour because everybody's not everybody's not on one Accord we're not we're not pulling for the for God with the same uh intensity but God is real and he's serious and we and you and I must understand the only way we're going to get we've got a turn we got to get before God in our own little closets wherever you pray and you better say God help me return I don't want to be sealed in my ear I don't want to con and it's true I mean you know you it's everywhere you go you preach a message I remember years ago when the Holy Ghost was really moving you preach a message you didn't have to worry about coming people coming to the altar praying wherever they be it happened now you can preach a a convicted message a a a uh the hell and brimstone and people don't move they don't something's wrong you know why because people have gotten so laxy Daisy they really are comfortable they have become lukewarm even in this assembly this is time to take our inheritance I believe that listen what he said did you notice have you read he says if a man bought property inside of a wall City then he had one year to redeem that back if he sold it and if he did not redeem that back that property if it was inside of a wall had to stay in there it could not go free in the Jubilee it was bound to stay there they were over the over the wall they never heard the Jubilee the trumpet sounding they sounded a trumpet and could not go free and I'm afraid that one of the the things that we have had in the beginning how that old time of preachers against organized in ourselves together we turned around and done the very thing back that our fathers fought so hard to come out of it's true people can't even get in the spirit without people feeling uncomfortable and we've got to change and the only way that that can change is that God come down and changes but you got to have a willing heart all of us all of us amen and the wall I'm afraid that too many of us today too many of our Pentecostal people have got walled into some denomination some organization somewhere and we'll never hear the sound of the Jubilee and never come again uh back to the inheritance now he talk about organization but what about our habits that got us walled in that we can't even hear the gospel enough to repeat repent rather you know instead we we get an attitude or something ain't nobody picking God trying to save us amen God trying to save us but if you harden your heart to it it it would do us no good it does the preacher no good if you don't have ears to hear that that that's what's coming forth is not the man brother Brooks but uh the the spirit of God anointing him to say what he needs to say he said look what he said instead of having Fellowship one with another is divided us and separated us in several different organizations of people and in doing so it has broke out up broke up our inheritance so maybe we're not divided in the organization but we're divided among ourselves into groups huh hello somebody if we ever get walled into a place where we can't accept the word and the Holy Spirit and have to take Creeds and so forth to a church instead of the power of the Holy Spirit the Jubilee will never mean nothing to that person H and he said that's how it is in the organization he said they've been bored in their ear my mama was a Baptist my daddy was a Baptist he said what it is he said that he said that that uh that uh uh that that slave mentality continues from generation to generation you love the Lord you said well why you preaching so hard because it shook me I realize that we you know sometime we procrastinate us we we say we're not but we are we're not desperate enough you know we we let me put it this way I'm talking about myself now because I realize that there's more God that that that that we need there's got to be a greater refilling than what we're getting we have a good prayer life we need more until our Our Lives can be identical to this y'all hear what I'm saying why because even the prophet of God said we'll be so much like him we'll pull him from heaven now I don't know about you but I'm not there yet and all I know is he said that's what gets us prayer sweat tears promise you got a promise you need to cry sweat and whatever more until you get it amen you don't have to say amen I say Amen because I know who's talking and let me say it like this people of God it doesn't matter what we say in our mouths if it's not there continue confessing it but you don't stop confessing it ever y'all hear what I'm saying because the Pama worm comes along listen it's true I don't even know we I know we have testimonies but how often do we get them up here written out something God got to be doing something and we fail to see that this is the operation of the church it edifies because somebody may need that now I'm going on the road now because I want you to understand it is later than what you and I think and the Perfection that God wants to see in us maybe y'all can see it but I'm not seeing it not what I see not with my eyes and I know the husband must first first be partaker of the food that's okay but I won't stay where I'm at I can promise you that because I know I'm not a servant I'm a son and I've got an inheritance if you don't see I'mma tell you something I don't who was I talking to I'm going to close now y'all think church service is long well in hell you don't get out of service y'all hear what I'm saying in hell you don't there is no time clock you can't get impatient it would do no good anyhow y'all hear what I'm saying and we look at church time or or this time and we think it's a lot of it's not a lot of time that early church how can we compare to them Paul preached all night how can we compare how can we compare TOA Street people oh that Pentecost they had more than what message people got we might have a word you don't have to say amen I know it's true it's evident brother B say compare yourself to what they had and see whether this church measure up to it tell me anybody here can say you can measure yourself up to that and stand with those people who cared nothing about prayer and how long they were there didn't care about position didn't care about what they was going to wear came to church with whatever they had whether they were hungry it didn't make no difference brother B was just saying on that tape how one sister lost her baby and didn't have enough money to even put it in a coffin so the brothers cut up some wood and built a coffin and to bury the baby you think that turned her against God and we supposed to be greater a double portion y'all got it who got it you got that double portion come on I mean manifest I'm I ain't talking about on the way we know it's on the way I'm talking about do y'all know what I'm trying to say people that's our inheritance not tomorrow today am I know I I sound like I'm fussing I don't mean to sound that way I'm serious though in everything I'm saying because I feel really inspired by God to say it now you can believe it's God and you don't have to but my point is you will be judged by what's being said and God got us here because there is this time now I I tell you what if time is the way it really is and God counts generations and here in this magazine that I didn't bring it talks about here's a a president that is a modern president bringing in all of these modern things and brought in the area of Leo he was the inspiration him and his wife brother say she cut her hair and all the women in America fashioned herself like and she was of the Catholic Church come on somebody now we have seen what they've done in 50 years that means it's harvest it's harvest we are now at a harvest so if we are at a harvest there are Reapers somewhere and there's a period like brother R said just like God Amen marked Israel and says listen hold it up the 11th hour I'm done almost and the 11th Hour has been long time ago God stopped the Four Winds but he get you know down in Revelation those Four Winds winds were let loose there but hold it up till I seal I'm talking about the servants and that was Israel the 144,000 hadn't been sealed yet but it was stop for them God slips in a bride age that's you and I and what are we doing with our time looks all of us need more and all of us because I'm going tell you something I want to have that Atmos steere no matter where I go I've experienced it every now and then sometime things happen with bump bumps up into that love atmosphere but that's not supposed to be every every other time it's supposed to be the same kind of atmosphere that William Brandon brought in the room when he was coming in it wasn't some time it was all the time he kept himself behind the veil and I believe with all my heart that's what the bride is supposed to be there was where she budded behind the ve that's where her it wasn't in and out in and out it was de and that's where the fruit was made manifest right and brother brandham said it like this and then Clos it and no matter what we say I say it like this he said God even though Abraham had been chosen and elected of God God could not fully bless Abraham until he had separated himself from l and I'm going tell you something until we fully separate ourselves from lot God can't fully bless us and lot represents lukewarmness worldliness pitching our tent towards Sodom those kind of things that God is trying to get us to see now we may stand you know I watch things and I'm sure God does too positive things have always received an amen negative things we hardly ever say Amen when we know it's true and if the amen is in you whether it be positive or negative it's going to amen his word and it's amazing how when it's positive is God when it's negative is that God of brother Brooks surely God won't be telling us these things perhaps that's the way Israel thought too he wouldn't be talking like this perhaps that's the way Israel thought too and their thoughts were heard in heaven and God judges every one of our thoughts whether you receive him or reject him if I spoke the untruth tonight then I'm a liar and God will deal with me but if I spoke the truth and you don't receive it then God will judge you because that don't make no difference what we think we are God is the spokesman he knows the depths of our hearts he knows what's in there let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord you've been so good to us and Lord you plac this message in my heart you placed that urgency and Lord I say it like this God I humble myself before you Lord I am guilty I've allowed myself to not be on fire at all times I've allowed myself to be discouraged at time because of the D pool that I feel in service I allow myself not to worship you in the way that you Des desire not only that the way that you're worthy to be worshiped heavenly father I pray that you will restore the saints of God here Lord you know who all you were talking to I can't say say that I'm in a place that I cannot receive correction or chastisement because father you say that you chasen Those whom you love and Lord I Thank you for being real in my life in our lives I believe these people you love otherwise you would not have brought or given me the message in which you gave give us Grace Lord God to break every Alliance that we may have with Satan or the world we are a standard father we must be that standard in order for you to be pleased with us Lord we need more power and strength in this church we need a Revival father God we need more than just a church service and a hearing of a word we need that life of that word to live its way through us all of us Lord God help us here father open our hearts open our eyes that we might see exactly where we standing with you father this is our year to come completely free of every bondage Satan placed upon us whether it be by by deception or by will we can go free and I pray father God that you would Grant every soul in here Freedom father free from every sickness every disease every Financial bondage uh every spiritual bondage Lord I pray that you grant us Victory help us now Lord granted in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen so that you will understand the kind of perfection I'm speaking of I'm speaking with your flesh will never be perfected until you are perfected with a uh theophany and glorified body the inner man must come to Perfection but brother brandham says amen even in the Seal's book he said as long as you got this even when the man is perfect you capable of making mistakes that's what I'm speaking of not the outer shell the inner shell grows up into a perfect statue of Christ the outer shell is your enemy it will be sticky even in se's book he said it'll be the same thing there's no conversion with your natural man no sir he's going to always be your enemy till the Rapture comes amen only thing you can do is try to kill it every day that's right
