[50:56] whatsoever he says
[50:58] now verse 24 verse the Bible says that
[51:03] therefore I say unto you
[51:06] what things so ever you desire
[51:11] When you pray believe that you have

[51:25] desire that's right
[51:27] Amen in verse 25 the Bible continues and
[51:31] says that and when you stand praying
[51:32] forgive reversible
[51:42] against any that your father also which
[51:46] is in heaven May forgive you your
[51:48] trespasses
[51:54] do not forgive neither will your father
[51:58] which is in heaven forgive us
[52:06] father God we humbly come before your
[52:08] throne of grace
[52:11] Lord just to say thank you
[52:13] Mercy Lord we thank you Father Lord for
[52:16] your grace and your mercies
[52:19] thank you Father God for keeping us
[52:22] alive
[52:24] Lord we thank you for the holy spirit
[52:26] inside of us
[52:29] thank you for your presence this morning
[52:33] that you helped me to be successful to
[52:36] the Holy Spirit
[53:04] amen verse 25 I'm going to read it again
[53:08] the Bible says the end when you stand
[53:12] praying forgive
[53:14] read the whole thing oh and when you
[53:16] stand praying forgive if you have ought
[53:19] against any that your father also which
[53:22] is in heaven May forgive you your
[53:24] trespasses
[53:33] because we know that faith is based upon
[53:36] forgiveness
[53:40] amen faith is upon forgiveness
[53:45] amen you might be standing here
[53:48] and the brother comes to you asking for
[53:51] prayer
[53:53] and you have a grudge against that
[53:55] brother
[53:58] even how are you expecting to pray for
[54:01] that brother unless you forgive him
[54:05] and you won't even have faith
[54:08] so you have to forgive first
[54:12] I have faith that once you pray your
[54:14] prayer will be heard
[54:18] so that's what I said that faith is
[54:21] based upon forgiveness
[54:24] amen and faith is also based upon the
[54:26] unity
[54:28] amen because God says that if he abide
[54:31] in me
[54:34] amen and my word abides in you
[54:38] then you are able to ask whatever you
[54:41] want Allah
[54:49] you abiding in God
[54:52] and letting his word abiding in you
[54:56] in other words you become one with this
[54:59] word
[55:01] you go along you become one with his
[55:04] word
[55:06] and abiding in God
[55:09] in other words means that to have faith
[55:11] in God
[55:14] so that scripture amen it's uh uh I
[55:18] believe John chapter 15 verse 7. uh Jean
[55:21] verses that if you abide in me Liberia
[55:26] and my words abide in you
[55:30] shall ask what you will
[55:33] and it shall be done unto you
[55:36] if you have faith in me
[55:39] and once you have faith in me
[55:42] my words will abide in you
[55:46] Jesus knew who he was
[55:49] amen that's what he's telling you that
[55:51] if you're abide in me
[55:54] amen he knew that he was a counselor
[55:58] he knew that he was a provider
[56:01] he knew that he was The Giver of all
[56:04] perfect and great gifts
[56:07] and he knew that he was the one who can
[56:09] forgive him
[56:11] and he knew that he was the one who
[56:13] could multiply
[57:12] he knows that when he makes a sad face
[57:14] or mom cannot say no he said okay
[57:21] his mom will always give it to him
[57:25] amen amen so a child knows who he is so
[57:30] um
[57:31] yes we do have space in the front here
[57:34] for the people in the back
[57:36] um
[57:40] and so
[57:42] we are hello in foreign
[58:42] even for the Statue of the perfect man
[58:45] memories Paul says that add to your
[58:48] faith Paul ADI amen so faith is the
[58:52] foundation
[58:54] on which you will build your house
[58:58] you need to have faith
[59:01] without faith you can't please God
[59:04] without faith you can't have the healing
[59:07] of your body
[59:09] without faith you cannot have the answer
[59:12] of your promise to your prayers
[59:15] without faith you can't have a blessing
[59:18] soon
[59:19] amen so we need to have faith
[59:22] faith is very important
[59:25] so the key in faith is the hand that
[59:29] holds the key
[59:30] element
[59:33] amen the key is the scripture like amen
[59:37] and faith is the hand that unlocks it is
[59:40] the key is the scripture
[59:48] but to have that promise applied to your
[59:51] life
[59:53] and you have to have faith
[59:55] amen the face to unlock their problems
[59:59] God promised healing
[1:00:02] when God promises us God promised to
[1:00:05] bless us
[1:00:06] and God promised to protect us
[1:00:09] God promised to always be with us
[1:00:13] and that promise will not serve you any
[1:00:16] good
[1:00:17] yourself
[1:00:18] amen if you're only reading it
[1:00:21] but that promise will help you
[1:00:24] if you have the faith to unlock series
[1:00:28] if you have the faith you unlocked
[1:00:31] amen that's why faith is very important
[1:00:35] amen we need to have faith and faith is
[1:00:39] not an imagination imagination
[1:01:39] that's good to have that that thought
[1:02:40] amen you've got to know something the

[1:02:48] you're having facing
[1:02:52] before you can
[1:02:54] before you can have faith in it foreign
[1:04:50] the kid can go to his mother or dad
[1:04:54] mouthful foot and the father will
[1:04:56] provide it
[1:04:59] that's the same relationship we have to
[1:05:01] have with God
[1:05:03] you know who he is
[1:05:08] asking him as a father
[1:05:11] asking him as a friend
[1:05:14] and he will give it to us
[1:05:16] amen there is something about friendship

[1:05:24] they know very well that I'm not really
[1:05:27] good at paying my debts but I'm honest
[1:05:29] about this is
