[10:07] [Music]
[10:12] [Music]
[10:23] one day into the chamber into the
[11:11] chamber we gently and I close
[12:14] Luva kind of is all amen thank God for
[12:36] His grace and His mercy amen
[12:38] surely God is good to us and we thank
[12:43] God for His goodness his grace and His
[12:47] mercy we are a creature that has been
[12:53] given so much grace it just seems like
[12:58] the word hallelujah is not even
[13:00] appropriate to praise God with I'm sure
[13:06] when we get over there he's gonna give
[13:08] us another word it has to do now for now
[13:17] but I think that when the Redeem of the
[13:20] Lord goes marching it's going to be a
[13:23] glorious time I think about Amazing
[13:29] Grace that song throughout eternity you
[13:33] will never fade it will always mean
[13:37] something to those who have been
[13:40] redeemed you and I have a lot to be
[13:44] thankful for we could have been born in
[13:48] a different age out of this instead of
[13:50] this age but God saw something that he
[13:55] in us that even our eyes cannot see
[13:59] he chose the best for last
[14:02] it's quite difficult to see yourself as
[14:05] the best but it is true when you think
[14:11] about those who have given their lives
[14:14] to be martyrs yet they were not equipped
[14:19] or designed for this age they wouldn't
[14:24] have made it
[14:27] our age is the most difficult age of all
[14:29] ages like brother branham said all the
[14:34] other ages before us knew their enemy my
[14:37] enemy is easy living easy living stops
[14:42] you from praying you easy living stop
[14:45] you from fasting easy living stop people
[14:49] from paying tithing and offering easy
[14:52] living
[14:53] it's killing a lot of Christians but we
[14:58] are grateful because we can keep our
[15:00] eyes focus to realize it's not by power
[15:04] nor by might but by the Spirit of the
[15:08] Lord Jesus I have a lot to say I thought
[15:13] that my brother Jarrett was coming in he
[15:19] was but the I won't say the enemy just
[15:23] forgot he had another appointment so he
[15:26] wasn't able to come this evening but we
[15:28] and he and I spent hours today really
[15:32] discussing the word he was so excited
[15:35] about coming to church tonight but
[15:38] nevertheless the next time if the Lord I
[15:41] pray that you would pray with me that
[15:44] God would open his understanding and her
[15:47] understanding the father down the road
[15:50] with them than we were before so I just
[15:53] know one thing I just believe that he's
[15:55] one of us
[15:56] elected and chosen by God just because
[15:59] some of the things that he had said in
[16:02] our discussion as we turn let us turn to
[16:06] Chronicles 1st chronicles please 1:19
[16:11] first chronicles 1:19
[16:24] then return to Genesis 11 one through
[16:27] nine
[16:28] Brooke first Chronicles 119 you know God
[16:33] is so so powerful and unto Eber were
[16:49] born two sons the name of one was Peleg
[16:55] because in his days the earth was
[16:57] divided and his brother's name with
[17:01] Joplin okay I'll leave it there
[17:07] Genesis now increase
[17:20] Genesis 9 beginning at the 16th verse 17
[17:34] I'm sorry Genesis 11 please forgive me
[17:38] Genesis 11 1 through 9 and the whole
[17:43] earth was a one language and of one
[17:47] speech and it came to pass as they
[17:50] journeyed from the east that they found
[17:53] a plain in the land of Shinar or Shina
[17:56] and they dwelt there and they said one
[18:01] to another go to let us make brick and
[18:03] burn them thoroughly and they had brick
[18:07] for stone and slime had they for mortal
[18:11] and they said go to let us build us a
[18:15] city and a tower whose top may reach it
[18:19] to heaven and let us make a stone a name
[18:23] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[18:26] face of the whole earth and the Lord
[18:29] came down to see the city and the tower
[18:31] which the children of men built it and
[18:33] the Lord said Behold the people is one
[18:35] and they have all one language and this
[18:39] they began to do and now nothing will be
[18:43] restrained from them which they have
[18:45] imagined to do go to let us go down and
[18:50] there confound their language that they
[18:53] may not understand one another speech so
[18:58] the Lord scattered them abroad from
[18:59] thence upon the face of all the earth
[19:01] and they left off to build the city
[19:05] therefore it is the name of it called
[19:07] Babel because the Lord did there
[19:10] confound the language of all the earth
[19:12] and from thence did the Lord scattered
[19:15] them abroad upon the face of all the
[19:19] earth let us pray Heavenly Father God we
[19:22] come before you we thank you for your
[19:25] grace in your mercy
[19:26] we thank you for being so good to us we
[19:30] thank you Lord Jesus for breaking and
[19:32] destroying the yokes of the
[19:34] we thank you for being the piece giver
[19:36] Lord we thank you for being a hard fixer
[19:40] and mind regulator we thank you for
[19:42] being the comforter there is none like
[19:45] you or God and we pray Lord that's
[19:48] evening that you would have dine on way
[19:50] and we'll be careful to give you the
[19:52] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[19:55] name we pray amen
[19:56] you may be seated we thank God for his
[20:02] the beauty of his word I was thinking
[20:08] and I know the scripture text may seem a
[20:10] little strange to you tonight and when
[20:13] when I tell you what the subject matter
[20:15] is what time is it what time is it and I
[20:27] really believe I can say that the time
[20:29] is now we know by God's grace and
[20:34] according to the Word of God that when
[20:37] God created the earth the earth or the
[20:39] landmass was one now we know by science
[20:45] science says that they call it the
[20:48] continental drift and God calls it peel
[20:56] egg
[20:59] it was the name
[21:00] God had given this young man because his
[21:04] name means division and his brother's
[21:08] name Jacquin means small dispute and
[21:11] contention so I went back to Genesis and
[21:15] I thought about how men even to this day
[21:18] are trying to unite in such a way that
[21:22] they can outsmart God because that's
[21:25] exactly what Nimrod wanted to do he
[21:30] thought that he could outsmart God by
[21:32] building a temple or building a building
[21:36] and that building a men reached into
[21:40] heaven and you say well what I mean why
[21:45] would God be so concerned because you
[21:46] got to understand these people were very
[21:48] skillful a lot of time people think that
[21:52] these people in that day care at clubs
[21:54] and you know just really backwards but
[21:58] brother Branham said they were very
[21:59] intelligent people you got it you gotta
[22:02] be understand that these people were
[22:04] right after the fall you and I must
[22:08] understand that even during that time
[22:10] people grew bigger and they last and
[22:13] live longer I guess in the days of Noah
[22:18] we find out that these people thought
[22:21] that they were they could continue on in
[22:24] the way in which they were living and
[22:26] God of heaven was going to do nothing
[22:28] about it they forgot that God had judged
[22:31] Adam and Eve for just one sin they must
[22:35] have forgotten that God had taken out
[22:37] and eat out of the garden and because of
[22:40] their sin that's why they were the way
[22:43] they were living and so I got to the
[22:47] place they just start they had it all
[22:49] together God brought Norlin Noah on the
[22:52] scene that's what I love about God God
[22:56] he always comes at a time when you least
[22:59] expect him and he's always hiding
[23:02] himself he had those people understood
[23:06] that that wasn't the message in note in
[23:08] which Noah preached was in his own
[23:10] message and had they known that that was
[23:13] God in MO
[23:14] and Noah preaching they would have
[23:16] listened but God always veils himself he
[23:22] veils himself so he could confound the
[23:25] wise all right
[23:28] so you you you and I must understand
[23:31] that after the flood and you know men
[23:33] began to increase and go on in the way
[23:36] they did they thought well we're not let
[23:38] this happen again
[23:39] but remember if they had only known the
[23:42] scripture had only known what God had
[23:44] promised nor God had already told no it
[23:47] was going to never rain in such a way
[23:50] again Genesis the ninth chapter
[23:52] beginning at the 16th verse and the bow
[23:55] shall be in the clouds and I will look
[23:57] upon it that I may remember the
[23:59] everlasting covenant between God and
[24:01] every living creature of all flesh that
[24:03] is upon the earth and God said unto Noah
[24:06] this is the token of the Covenant which
[24:09] I have established between me and all
[24:11] flesh that is upon the earth but because
[24:14] they didn't know what God has spoken to
[24:16] Noah all of that building was in vain
[24:19] you see even you take what they're
[24:22] trying to do tonight or even in our day
[24:24] you you know they're trying to establish
[24:27] what we call a wormhole establish some
[24:30] way of connecting with the next
[24:32] dimension they know they exist see
[24:35] because they can't explain these
[24:36] phenomenons how people can be seen and
[24:40] not seen they have a record how things
[24:44] come through our our dimension and then
[24:46] disappear they know these things exist
[24:50] so they are curious of how to get there
[24:52] and you and I have the answer there is a
[24:58] way of getting there and that is through
[25:01] the blood of the Lamb see because you
[25:04] got to realize that there was a time
[25:05] that heaven and earth were not divided
[25:07] they will connect it Adam woke up a man
[25:11] at the sound of the angelic voices Adam
[25:14] didn't have to pray a man to hear God's
[25:17] voice the Bible said everything every
[25:19] evening God walked in the cool of the
[25:21] evening and they had a conversation they
[25:23] had a fellowship why because there was
[25:26] no breach
[25:28] but we find out that man has always
[25:30] tried to build himself up to heaven is
[25:33] that right it is called Babylon it has
[25:37] seemed like right now Amen that people
[25:39] are becoming coming to a place to
[25:41] realize hey man that well I tell you
[25:44] what what they do is dismiss heaven now
[25:46] they dismissed the rapture they said
[25:49] they dismissed these things and believe
[25:51] it they dismiss these things that it
[25:54] won't happen they think that this Bible
[25:57] is some kind of fairy tale or some kind
[25:59] of myth they really believe that we made
[26:02] God but that's what intelligence are
[26:06] telling them but we didn't make God God
[26:10] made us everything that God has designed
[26:16] cannot perish it can't falter whatever
[26:22] God says that's what it means and the
[26:25] Bible says that the grounds were with us
[26:27] and the flowers fade away but the word
[26:29] of the Lord it doesn't matter how long
[26:34] it takes to come to pass God will
[26:36] interpret his own word they may laugh
[26:40] even as they laughed at Noah and said
[26:42] Noah you're insane you know something's
[26:44] wrong with you it's never rained before
[26:45] and they had no idea that they were
[26:48] going to be the one that would cause the
[26:51] rain just like it all day they can't in
[26:55] fathom they can't fathom the world
[26:57] burning amen and and literally going up
[27:00] an explosion I mean it can't it can't it
[27:03] can't happen this way so they invent
[27:06] things in their minds how the world is
[27:08] going to come to an end when the Bible
[27:09] has already told us how it's going to
[27:12] come to an end
[27:13] hallelujah and it took us a prophet a
[27:16] prophet came back and told us amen it
[27:18] was man who caused the slide and if it
[27:21] was man who caused the flood it will be
[27:24] man who would cause the fire we
[27:27] understand that we're living in the age
[27:29] of destruction the spirit of instruction
[27:32] is everywhere hallelujah and every
[27:36] nation see me right on on the button
[27:40] who's gonna
[27:41] push it first I was talking with brother
[27:44] Craig and he was really excited about
[27:47] this uh North Korea fella and and and
[27:53] and and Trump coming together he said
[27:55] brother books do you realize what this
[27:57] mean
[27:57] he said that's probably the only country
[28:01] that we know of Amen that you can't get
[28:03] in there somewhere to preach the word
[28:07] and the Bible said that the bride will
[28:09] come from every nation he said I'm
[28:12] waiting as soon as that door opened I'm
[28:15] in there why he said because I feel that
[28:18] leadership I feel that anointing to go
[28:21] in because he said the door may not last
[28:23] long and I was so excited because I
[28:27] thought to myself that's right with one
[28:29] more step closer to the rapture
[28:32] hallelujah because you've got to realize
[28:35] hey man and those of us who were down
[28:37] there and in Iowa City you know
[28:39] confusion was in one of the messages but
[28:41] the Bible is right the message is right
[28:44] hallelujah amen but you and I must
[28:48] understand brother Branham said like
[28:50] this he said if a man has a true mount
[28:53] Transfiguration experience he can only
[28:56] worship the Lord Jesus Christ I got more
[29:00] than one quote on that hallelujah and
[29:04] man and might might need my word the
[29:07] word says neither is there salvation in
[29:09] any other there is no other name given
[29:12] under heaven whereby men must be saved
[29:15] that is the name of Jesus Christ so
[29:18] everything under heaven now when we get
[29:21] ready to go up the name will be changed
[29:24] hallelujah but we won't need a name
[29:27] change until that time y'all hear me
[29:31] until this Pentecostal feast is over
[29:35] you understand me and the Pentecostal
[29:38] feasts amen came after the atonement
[29:40] right when the trumpets were brought and
[29:44] then that trumpet was gathering the
[29:46] people together remember hey man when we
[29:50] talk about Jesus coming into Jerusalem
[29:53] you got to understand
[29:55] at the atonement the sound was gathered
[29:57] and they were there for the toll meant
[30:00] hallelujah and in that atonement came
[30:03] riding on a donkey hallelujah amen it
[30:07] was there amen the sacrifice was made
[30:10] but fifty days afterwards
[30:13] 7/7 after that that started the
[30:16] Pentecostal feast hallelujah and Peter
[30:20] preached the first sermon hallelujah and
[30:23] he ended his message with repent and be
[30:26] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:27] Christ for the remission of your sins
[30:29] and that same name is the only name that
[30:33] this age will end up with you say what
[30:37] do you mean because once the Pentecostal
[30:39] feast is over the seven trumpets like
[30:42] brothers and those seven trumpets a
[30:44] mensch rounded amen during the six are
[30:47] under our sixth seal hallelujah but once
[30:51] that Pentecostal feast is over
[30:53] Amen we're now will be raptured that's
[30:58] why he said the Feast of the trumpet he
[31:00] said that is for the Jews but I'm gonna
[31:02] bill you all the way up so you can see
[31:04] where you're standing hallelujah
[31:07] because once we understand that those
[31:10] seven thunders are no seven seals Amen
[31:12] sounded under the sixth seal that means
[31:15] by the grace of God Amen when they
[31:18] reached their Pentecostal they are told
[31:21] it will go and you know what this
[31:25] trumpet is calling us to this Sunday
[31:27] what is calling us to to a rapture it is
[31:32] a gathering of the people and that's
[31:35] what we're gathered to you know he must
[31:40] understand this
[31:41] this thing is so simple it's so real we
[31:43] can't make it complicated hallelujah and
[31:47] we know by God's grace he is the god of
[31:50] him all Fame hallelujah by God's grace
[31:54] God in every age put on a mask
[31:57] hallelujah in the everson stage he had
[32:00] the master who Paul Paul said there were
[32:05] people among him who even thought he was
[32:07] God that
[32:09] give their life for him he said Paul
[32:11] said some of you even thought I was
[32:13] Jesus Christ himself
[32:15] you wouldn't even prompt your eyes out
[32:18] for me that's what he said
[32:20] he said some of you say I am appalled he
[32:23] said some of you say I am ever Cephas he
[32:26] said but I tell you this I died for
[32:28] nobody
[32:30] hallelujah how in the world can paul bv
[32:34] God hallelujah in Paul said I want to
[32:37] know him hallelujah
[32:39] I want to know him in the power of his
[32:42] resurrection and his suffering so
[32:46] understand this God who is in Martha
[32:49] he's no longer wearing the mass of
[32:51] William Branham but he's mad wearing the
[32:54] mass of the bride hallelujah it's the
[33:00] truth
[33:00] and you know I must understand that's
[33:03] not being disrespectful to brother
[33:05] Branham that's being respectful brother
[33:08] Browne said when you make me a god when
[33:10] you look at me like that you are now
[33:12] making me an antichrist hallelujah but
[33:20] you got those people see if you got the
[33:22] Holy Ghost like I was telling the
[33:23] brothers down in in Iowa City if you
[33:25] don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have
[33:27] enough discernment to know what was
[33:29] being said that's by a lot of people
[33:34] hiding man because they didn't catch it
[33:37] but see I don't understand French but he
[33:39] does and I knew something was wrong hmm
[33:46] that's what people don't understand you
[33:48] know I look at these things and I said
[33:50] it's okay I thank God for what happened
[33:52] I'm not discouraged and I think God
[33:57] would happen because now I know for
[34:00] certain who I am and who they are
[34:06] you won't understand all that I'm saying
[34:08] but nevertheless God knows right you and
[34:12] I must understand this thing is so fine
[34:15] line it's a hairline and oh listen how
[34:22] can anybody
[34:23] inin in here say I am up william branham
[34:27] you have a different spirit if that's
[34:31] what you think
[34:32] you have no no no no no I got the Holy
[34:34] Ghost
[34:35] you said prove that what are you saying
[34:38] why are you saying these things I'm
[34:40] hoping it's recorded and I'm hoping
[34:41] somebody gonna listen to my response
[34:43] hardly new because you see what happened
[34:46] is brother bellum went behind the
[34:49] curtain of time and he saw millions
[34:52] running to him and he asked the angel
[34:56] are all of these branham's and the angel
[34:59] said no they are not branham's
[35:03] they are converse to Christ Nereus so I
[35:08] am of Christ that's what has been the
[35:16] issue in this message who gives it a
[35:18] reproach y'all remember people came in
[35:23] here trying to tell me what a new name
[35:25] is and I caught it in the spirit the new
[35:27] name of Jesus Jesus Christ is what Jesus
[35:30] Christ he no other name given among men
[35:36] we don't baptize his his name you see
[35:39] the pressure of the whole thing is this
[35:42] Babylon it is a mess of confusion and
[35:47] that same spirit has moved up not in the
[35:51] message can't be in the message but
[35:52] among the message you understand me and
[35:55] they put the pressure on us to bow down
[35:58] to the image of a prophet that's why
[36:02] brother Branham brought out that the
[36:04] image that they make the King wanted him
[36:06] to bow down to was the image of Daniel
[36:09] and not even Daniel would bow to the
[36:13] image hallelujah and you find in the
[36:17] book of Revelation Amen when John went
[36:19] down to bow before the angel the seventh
[36:22] angel he said get up from there I am
[36:24] your brother my servant right I'm a
[36:28] brother amen you worship God I believe
[36:31] with all my heart that angel was brother
[36:33] Branham
[36:36] I can't help it to worship the Lord
[36:39] Jesus if that put me out of the message
[36:42] in them out hallelujah
[36:46] but one thing I do know we're living in
[36:50] a time where everybody's trying to unite
[36:53] and only the true bride of Jesus Christ
[36:57] is going to announce right unite you
[37:00] know who she's gonna unite with those
[37:02] who really believe that her husband
[37:04] their husband is no other than the
[37:06] person of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[37:10] Rebecca didn't remarry
[37:12] Eloisa hallelujah Rebecca Mayer Isaac
[37:17] but Eleazar was an announcer he was the
[37:21] one who was bringing Rebecca to Isaac
[37:27] was it God in him God in him God in you
[37:32] God in me was God and Moses yes was God
[37:36] in Joshua yes was God in David yes and
[37:41] you won't make it to heaven if God ain't
[37:43] in you you and I must understand this is
[37:52] the hour now that you and I must girdle
[37:55] up the laws of our minds and be SOVA
[37:58] right see you and I must understand when
[38:03] those trumpet sounds good brother Babel
[38:05] said that's why God would not allow him
[38:07] to preach the trumpets because he had
[38:09] already preached the trumpets when he
[38:11] preached the seven seals
[38:13] is that a quote that's what he said
[38:16] so he said understand when those
[38:19] trumpets sounded he said every last one
[38:22] of them sounded under what we call our
[38:25] sixth seal hallelujah because he said
[38:29] those copies were sounding amen to bring
[38:32] them back to the atonement now watch
[38:35] this because I want you to understand
[38:37] where we are because if we're there at
[38:40] the Pentecostal feasts as soon as our
[38:43] Pentecostal thisis over as soon as that
[38:46] last one come in we take a rapture and
[38:49] the two proper
[38:50] now revealed to Israel hallelujah you
[38:55] said what do you mean he said brother
[38:57] Balaam said like this he said Moses and
[38:59] Elijah was that sixth seal hallelujah
[39:03] and the mystery behind the seventh seal
[39:06] was William Penn nobody ever knew that
[39:11] will be a Gentile prophet major profit
[39:15] hallelujah this property you may not
[39:17] agree with me but he was more greater
[39:19] than Moses hallelujah he was greater
[39:24] than Elijah though he represents the
[39:28] spirit of Elijah who who see how I might
[39:30] get in trouble with this but I'm gonna
[39:31] tell you something though there was a
[39:33] time there was a prophecy that went out
[39:35] in the service that Moses Elijah and
[39:39] Jesus would be in the service you think
[39:45] oh come on somebody what was it God
[39:47] coming down veiling himself hallelujah
[39:52] in a little Kentuckian kind of like Noah
[39:56] nobody want to pay me attention you say
[40:00] well who was that brother Brooks
[40:01] it was telling him it was God right
[40:05] but mimicked many times brother Branham
[40:08] he had the Holy Spirit you know he did
[40:09] right but there were times when he
[40:12] Elohim would step directly in him and
[40:14] there were times and then he didn't even
[40:16] know what he was saying he had to go
[40:19] back to here to take himself now my
[40:21] point is if he was telling him how come
[40:24] he didn't remember what he said he was a
[40:29] foul so being used hallelujah and you
[40:33] and I must understand by God's grace it
[40:36] meant that God is in Martha that's what
[40:38] he is
[40:39] in marseilles he can change the mess
[40:41] whenever he wants to
[40:43] but listen because I put coke in a
[40:46] bottle that means the bottle is coke
[40:51] hallelujah Amen it's the substance
[40:55] that's in the bottle
[41:03] this is what he says yes yes let me tell
[41:05] you something one of the greatest if you
[41:07] want to see what time of year it is look
[41:10] on the calendar if you want to see what
[41:13] time of night it is look on the clock if
[41:16] you want to see what day you're living
[41:18] in look where the Jews are God's
[41:22] timepiece and look the very night the
[41:27] very day the angel of the Lord met me
[41:29] 1946 on may 17 hope you all know what
[41:33] may 17 mean did you know that may 17 was
[41:38] also at the same time that Noah went
[41:40] into the ark the second month the
[41:48] seventeenth day of the Jewish calendar
[41:51] it would be our May 17 and God comes
[41:56] right here oh come on somebody and you
[42:00] look at you say well what do you mean
[42:01] listen God don't do anything just to be
[42:04] doing it there's a purpose behind it
[42:07] hallelujah why because there is all the
[42:11] lapping of something here God is getting
[42:14] ready to bring forth Moses and Elijah
[42:15] and the Pentecostal feast our feast is
[42:18] almost over Alleluia and then when when
[42:26] what what what did this call
[42:27] what did this thing call us from just
[42:30] like if you study uh uh Egypt and Moses
[42:33] and all of the things that took place
[42:35] you're going to find out that the same
[42:37] kind of Exodus they had we're happening
[42:40] but in the spiritual realm hallelujah
[42:44] and when we leave out of here guess what
[42:47] we put the atonement on the doorpost in
[42:49] the little that right that means you've
[42:51] got to die to yourself hallelujah when
[42:53] you cost you the see oh but on the other
[42:55] side there's a feast going on there's a
[42:58] shouting or no there's a praising going
[43:00] on and you and I must understand this is
[43:03] where where the Bible got us now we're
[43:05] right at it folks is closer than you
[43:07] think
[43:10] hallelujah why because even now I just
[43:13] heard the other day that Israel is
[43:16] to the training temple guards I think I
[43:20] heard that from brother rich and my
[43:24] thing is why why did they take him in a
[43:28] corn and they put Trump on there Trump
[43:31] Trump Trump the last Trump and then they
[43:34] put Trump on one side and they put Cyrus
[43:38] on the other King Cyrus why because King
[43:41] Cyrus and Trump are doing the same thing
[43:43] the Alpha has become the Omega then
[43:46] literally he said go back home and build
[43:48] a temple go back home so you can get
[43:51] your your house in order and start this
[43:53] thing all over again
[43:54] and that's exactly what Trump is doing
[43:57] hallelujah and if they are building and
[44:00] preparing for this great thing to happen
[44:02] why do you think Moses and Elijah is
[44:06] there's one place brother man said
[44:08] they'll be transplanted I don't know but
[44:11] if they were transplanted on Mount
[44:13] Transfiguration they could be
[44:15] transplanted in Jerusalem they've been
[44:19] there before hallelujah and then at the
[44:23] second time I don't know which it is
[44:25] it's also he they could be living there
[44:27] right now I remember when my wife and I
[44:30] went to Jerusalem in here 2000 I said
[44:34] Lord let me give a church a book to some
[44:37] Jew that will really appreciate it
[44:40] hallelujah and I gave a church a book to
[44:43] our our tour guide and she said oh
[44:46] brother branham like she learned him
[44:49] before and she just started reading it
[44:51] right being thanking us for it now I
[44:54] don't know what that book is to this day
[44:55] but you never know hallelujah i sat
[45:01] there with these Jews and I'm telling
[45:02] you they spiritual amen and this uh-huh
[45:05] I can't remember his name
[45:07] I sent with him he's one of the lay men
[45:10] over the Temple Mount
[45:11] he literally fought in the six-day war I
[45:15] was there with him sitting there and all
[45:18] of a sudden he's is all he says there's
[45:20] seven ministers in here he says God
[45:22] getting ready to do something seven gave
[45:27] me some tip amount dirt and all that
[45:30] stuff and
[45:30] got it to this day hallelujah now you
[45:33] say nothing to that but I'm gonna tell
[45:35] you something amen that God is so real
[45:38] this man said to us any bit school in
[45:41] the and all of us he said you guys are
[45:43] more spiritual than what we are
[45:45] he said if I hadn't known that there was
[45:47] a war going on like that like this one
[45:49] he said I would have never showed up and
[45:50] I told Eddie biscuit not to even come
[45:52] but he said God told him to come and he
[45:55] came and then when they saw our women I
[45:59] saw our women dress and everything else
[46:01] he was just blown away they took us in
[46:03] Israel's army where they don't let
[46:06] people go in showed us and come to us
[46:08] and showed us things that they don't
[46:10] normally let people see we actually went
[46:12] into the the Temple Mount where the
[46:16] Muslims don't even know that they got
[46:18] places that you can going on in under
[46:20] this but my point is this we can be
[46:23] slothful if we want to but those people
[46:26] are zealous they believe that Messiah is
[46:29] coming hallelujah
[46:32] no matter how many times and you can't
[46:35] stop them now now that Jerusalem has
[46:38] been renamed the Capitol you can't stop
[46:41] them now if you want revival that's
[46:43] where you need to go right now
[46:45] hallelujah because those people are on
[46:48] fire because they know that their
[46:50] Messiah is soon to come hallelujah we
[47:01] don't understand
[47:02] this thing is closer than we think
[47:04] brother BAM said in World War one but
[47:07] World War one do World War one loose
[47:10] those two hundred thousand and demons
[47:13] whatever they are those demons that look
[47:15] like horses and got tails like snakes
[47:17] and all that kind of stuff you know and
[47:19] he said listen he said there's not two
[47:21] hundred demons in the world horses in
[47:23] the world
[47:24] he said these were supernatural charges
[47:27] and what would they do what would they
[47:29] loose for they will lose amen on the
[47:32] Jews and they were loose on the bride
[47:35] what do you think fights you every day
[47:38] chargers demon power amen that fault
[47:44] amen in the end eluvian time that was
[47:46] bound in the river Euphrates that's why
[47:49] you see all the adventures amen because
[47:51] it proves that the world before was far
[47:54] more intelligent than what we are
[47:59] telling the brothers I said why do
[48:01] people think that these people in the
[48:03] days of Noah
[48:04] amen had clothes and stuff like that I
[48:06] say they don't understand that these
[48:08] people in the days of Noah built a
[48:09] pyramid and I said what people say well
[48:12] they'd rather believe that some alien
[48:14] came from some planet and gave us this
[48:17] education had to believe the Bible I'd
[48:22] like to ask one of those scientists how
[48:24] in the world did Noah builded Ark he
[48:27] meant a survivor flood uh what to call
[48:30] it um apocalypse and it still partially
[48:38] sets up on the Mount Ararat hallelujah
[48:41] when the greater a greater man amen
[48:43] supposedly then Noah built what they
[48:45] call the Titanic and is still at the
[48:47] bottom one lake and it got down right
[48:50] st. and later we're right at the end of
[48:56] this thing
[49:08] revelation 9 13 12 13 to 14 cents and
[49:12] the sixth angel sounded and I heard a
[49:14] voice from the four horns of the golden
[49:16] altar which is before God saying to the
[49:18] sixth angel which had the trumpet loose
[49:20] the four angels which are bound in the
[49:22] great river Euphrates and you got to
[49:26] understand by God's grace had not God
[49:28] stopped World War 1 we wouldn't be here
[49:33] today
[49:34] eleventh hour 11th minute 11 second
[49:39] leaven month whatever that's when it
[49:41] stopped and nobody to this day know why
[49:43] it stopped hallelujah
[49:46] the Bible says stop it right now ah
[49:48] because I haven't sealed the servants of
[49:52] God in their foreheads there's a ceiling
[49:57] that gasps it has to come on hallelujah
[49:59] and we're not the servants Israel is a
[50:03] service there's another ceiling at the
[50:06] gold hallelujah but in between them
[50:10] there's a bride called out is that right
[50:14] said Amen we are the wild olive branch
[50:17] we're the wild olive the jews were
[50:20] blinded on purpose but now that you see
[50:23] that watch is real that's your calendar
[50:25] the eyes beginning to open hallelujah
[50:29] oh come on somebody and remember that
[50:33] atonement that feasts that they're going
[50:35] to have is not a feast of shouting it is
[50:38] a feast of mourning he's gonna wee-wee
[50:42] where did you get those scars they were
[50:44] laughs he was saying in the in the house
[50:47] of my friends then they'll be able to
[50:50] see Jesus Christ why because brother
[50:53] Branham said he's Moses and Elijah were
[50:55] preached the same message he preached is
[50:57] that the truth they have to if he had to
[51:00] preach what Paul preached they gotta
[51:02] preach what he preached there's only one
[51:07] way to heaven hallelujah
[51:11] listen revellings a knife chopping and
[51:15] 13 versions now notice real close under
[51:18] the sixth trumpet remember in 1913 he
[51:20] said under the sixth trumpet note there
[51:22] was 200,000 Horseman's that had been
[51:25] bound in the river euphrates was turned
[51:28] loose under the sixth seal trump excuse
[51:30] me now there's not a hundred thousand
[51:34] Horseman's in the world but there was
[51:36] two hundred thousand horsemen snows was
[51:39] he said I want you to jot it down so you
[51:42] can read it there wasn't natural horses
[51:45] they breathe fire they had breastplates
[51:47] of Jasper they had black tails and the
[51:51] end of the tail looked like a serpent
[51:52] and the snake head on the end of it
[51:54] stinging see it was spiritual horses
[51:57] spiritual Devils charges that have been
[51:59] bound in the Euphrates
[52:01] all these years supernatural Devils what
[52:04] was it the old Roman Empire being
[52:07] revived the persecution of the Jews
[52:11] right and you and I we look about was
[52:14] Ohio listen we know that there was an
[52:17] anointing of a woman who took the Bible
[52:19] out of school to buy a lot of it and
[52:21] after a while the church is going to
[52:23] deny the Bible they gonna call it
[52:30] obsolete you said no way yeah they
[52:33] already got the new revised version
[52:35] what's next if you're gonna deny a few
[52:37] words you're gonna deny all eventually
[52:41] and what you gonna do with that see what
[52:44] I'm saying
[52:45] but you and I must understand God is the
[52:48] word and the word is God ah you said
[52:57] what brother books I can't be wrong I've
[52:59] been taught this all my life
[53:00] well that's why the Jews are still in
[53:03] behind that's why the Muslims are blind
[53:06] that's why all of these other religions
[53:09] are blind because people have been
[53:10] taught how to be blind but there shall
[53:15] be like Alleluia they would turn loose
[53:20] on the Jews huh the persecution of the
[53:23] Jews supernatural devil
[53:25] and you and I never thought about it
[53:26] right but the only man can't do that man
[53:30] is bad but he can't do what these demons
[53:33] had him doing to the Jews now this was
[53:38] something supernatural it was it was
[53:40] such a a persuasion it was such a
[53:43] possession y'all hear what I'm saying
[53:46] and you and I must understand that's
[53:48] exactly what the devil is trying to do
[53:51] to the saints of God his whole desire is
[53:55] to possess you because once he possess
[53:58] you he can get you to do whatever he
[54:00] wants you to do not tomorrow now and he
[54:08] gets us by easy living hallelujah
[54:16] listen super I know I got you as friend
[54:19] said when they were they were in that
[54:21] war they didn't even lot of them didn't
[54:23] even know what Hitler was doing when
[54:27] they came out of that war and saw what
[54:29] Hitler had done they were not only
[54:31] shocked but many of them were a shame ah
[54:35] they were under the influence no let me
[54:44] tell you something that's why it's so
[54:46] important to preach it right because if
[54:50] you don't beat your right you get under
[54:52] that influence you become blind thinking
[54:56] that you see huh who was the first
[54:59] preacher he comes right down he preached
[55:04] to the angels for us he come right down
[55:06] and preached the same message to eat you
[55:09] got a will you can decide what you want
[55:12] to do hallelujah
[55:14] oh my your will need to be this not my
[55:18] wheel but let thine be done outside of
[55:22] that you ain't got a thought coming this
[55:29] what people don't understand this thing
[55:31] this message is the greatest thing that
[55:32] ever hit the earth hallelujah and you
[55:35] got to understand you have to have the
[55:37] whole ego
[55:38] at least a measure of disarmament of
[55:40] something Amen to know when you hear
[55:42] something that's twisted
[55:44] that's all I did twist I caught it
[55:49] didn't know what was being said and I
[55:52] asked some of the brothers later some
[55:54] didn't want to tell me what was being
[55:56] said sometimes you have to act a little
[56:00] we'll never usually wisdom like you
[56:02] already know then when you have like you
[56:07] already know they start telling you
[56:09] stuff
[56:10] hallelujah but one thing for sure that
[56:14] evening service hallelujah the true
[56:18] believers was there one brother one
[56:22] brother said god bless you brother
[56:24] god bless you but no fussing but no
[56:28] fighting it came sweet my god ah they
[56:35] turn loose to the Jews the persecutors
[56:36] the Jews supernatural Devils nearly 2000
[56:39] years then loosed by Stalin Hitler upon
[56:41] the Jews huh so who lost them Stalin
[56:45] Hitler and Mussolini and therefore there
[56:53] will be another man that's going to lose
[56:56] it these same demons on the foolish
[57:03] virgin oh he'll lose them on us but when
[57:07] he does we go up I'm tired of these old
[57:13] Christian oh praise the Lord I'm so glad
[57:15] you are when you get tired of us he
[57:18] wanted kids listen that's the truth they
[57:21] all the devil has always tried to stop
[57:24] the royal seed look throughout history
[57:27] of the Bible when they came for Jesus
[57:31] and you appeared and got him up out of
[57:33] there when it came for Moses an angel
[57:36] came and got him out of there
[57:37] hallelujah oh my and just like God did
[57:43] yesterday here do the same today when
[57:46] it's time to go we're gonna know it why
[57:49] because he said you're children of the
[57:51] light
[57:52] he will not catch you like a thief
[57:59] hallelujah Oh Lord he said Oh Lord I'm
[58:05] so bad that's one thing I like about the
[58:09] brother he preached that message about
[58:12] the loaf with the unleavened bread is
[58:16] 11:11 and then 11 hallelujah that's the
[58:20] victory of God right now but God can
[58:22] take himself and take that which is
[58:25] leaven and take the liver now hmm what
[58:30] do you think the cares of Christ's doing
[58:32] to you you don't remain 11 God comes
[58:39] that created power of the Holy Ghost
[58:42] comes in you and began to create Christ
[58:45] in you hallelujah the leaven is if I say
[58:49] anything is this ocean for flesh
[58:51] hallelujah but the Bible said on the
[58:53] moment of the tweaking Allah God is
[58:55] going to change is that Bible the Bible
[59:01] said no weapon formed against you shall
[59:03] prosper
[59:04] and not only that it says hey God your
[59:07] righteousness is of the Lord not your
[59:11] own that's why it's so important to get
[59:14] the Holy Ghost see me Lord heal me they
[59:23] were given roads listen he said because
[59:26] they've been blinded that they can't see
[59:28] their gospel that this people might be
[59:31] called out of the Gentiles for the bride
[59:32] they were given rose talking about the
[59:35] Jews the Bible said here under the
[59:36] trumpet them Jews who absolutely is
[59:39] against Christ and everything the reason
[59:42] they are because the Bible said they are
[59:44] blinded and they were blinded for your
[59:46] sake that's why we don't boss our self
[59:49] against the Jews hallelujah thank God
[59:52] that God was gracious enough to blind
[59:54] them that we can be grafted in I know it
[59:57] sounds terrible but when those words
[1:00:00] went out of their mouths at the day of
[1:00:02] crucifixion let his blood be on us and
[1:00:04] our children
[1:00:06] from then all the Jews have been having
[1:00:08] a rough time that curse deal is there
[1:00:12] that's why everybody hate them except
[1:00:17] the bride that's why but you know by
[1:00:22] God's grace
[1:00:23] what God is doing for us listen when God
[1:00:26] says fear not little flock it is the
[1:00:28] father's present that president give you
[1:00:30] the kingdom don't you fear your fear
[1:00:33] would keep God from operating with you
[1:00:37] no fear out I don't know whether I'm
[1:00:39] gonna make it if he promised it standing
[1:00:43] on the promises of God
[1:00:45] stand all the promises don't fear the
[1:00:47] devil or what he puts in your mind if
[1:00:49] you are truly God's elected he will
[1:00:53] bring it to pass
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:56] promise children you are the promise
[1:01:00] show me in the world where God ever
[1:01:02] broke his promise
[1:01:03] it ain't that and who can be as bad as
[1:01:08] Jacob hallelujah
[1:01:11] but when it was time for Jacob to change
[1:01:14] God met him and God will meet you right
[1:01:17] there he will produce the right troubles
[1:01:22] for you to come forth he's gonna do it
[1:01:28] it might be suffering you might have to
[1:01:31] wrestle through it but deep but but you
[1:01:33] already in the scripture you will
[1:01:35] overcome the angel who is that the truth
[1:01:41] we don't love each other like we ought
[1:01:43] to so brother BAM said God gonna bring
[1:01:45] the squeeze it's the truth
[1:01:50] God can't get us to pray like we ought
[1:01:51] to this is the most slow for age ever
[1:01:55] hallelujah let us see a spirit ain't no
[1:01:58] joke it is a powerful force even that
[1:02:02] you gotta fight every day all the time
[1:02:08] hallelujah but God is on your side yeah
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:13] you just didn't become right you were
[1:02:16] always bribed
[1:02:18] like I tell people you can't become
[1:02:20] Ryder you must be bribed from the
[1:02:23] foundation like brother silver said
[1:02:25] before ty hallelujah oh he preached that
[1:02:30] message meet me in Jerusalem I like that
[1:02:32] as the truth he there that Roman Empire
[1:02:38] bound thereby what ecclesiastical power
[1:02:41] which wrong pagan Rome become papal Rome
[1:02:44] and was bound there in its tradition of
[1:02:47] Christianity
[1:02:48] what part of Christianity superstitions
[1:02:50] it had of Rome putting together all
[1:02:53] these things worshipping of women and
[1:02:55] all these other kinds of stuff Christmas
[1:02:57] days and holidays and Christmas and
[1:03:00] holidays in holy days and things it's
[1:03:04] been bout the tradition that it cannot
[1:03:08] let loose because as against Christian
[1:03:10] principles
[1:03:11] it's against Christian Christian
[1:03:13] principles still the same ungodly pagan
[1:03:16] race period and that spirit caught into
[1:03:18] the nation of the world according to the
[1:03:20] prophecy of Ezekiel and the rest of them
[1:03:22] and they were loosed upon the Jews who
[1:03:24] know nothing of the Spirit there is your
[1:03:26] mystery that he ate under the six under
[1:03:28] the seal there see notice we were we we
[1:03:32] went through it and showed you this
[1:03:35] trumpet there here last trumpet what
[1:03:38] take place and y'all know what happened
[1:03:39] right because of that they were killed
[1:03:41] by Stalin Hitler and Mussolini and now
[1:03:44] they were thus they were the servants of
[1:03:47] the Lord because we're not servants we
[1:03:49] bribed they were servants under the Lord
[1:03:51] crying how long how long why because
[1:03:54] Jews are an eye for an eye they still
[1:03:58] under the law hallelujah but the bride
[1:04:01] of Jesus Christ is like Stephen Lord
[1:04:03] hold not these things to their charge we
[1:04:06] have a different language it's almost
[1:04:11] over you know hallelujah that was from
[1:04:14] the free third trumpet listen he said he
[1:04:16] says listen it is to call them back to
[1:04:18] that atonement see the atonement they
[1:04:20] rejected and they rejected did so our
[1:04:23] eyes could be open and theirs were
[1:04:25] closed and during this time he seals
[1:04:28] open up and the trumpet blow and blowing
[1:04:31] of the
[1:04:31] trumpets just before the Messiah comes
[1:04:33] cuz they got to be in Palestine and you
[1:04:36] remember God had to harden Pharaoh's
[1:04:38] heart to run them out of Egypt now I
[1:04:41] wonder who what the name of God gonna be
[1:04:43] with Moses and Elijah show up two names
[1:04:48] that's not that's that's what people are
[1:04:50] doing
[1:04:55] hmm
[1:05:00] people think you're stupid cuz you you
[1:05:02] never be stupid as long as you got God
[1:05:04] in you
[1:05:08] you gotta love everybody know no matter
[1:05:11] what you got to forgive everybody that
[1:05:14] was a powerful message and forgiveness
[1:05:16] that brother Aaron McGarry preached you
[1:05:19] ought to get it once it come online and
[1:05:21] he preached that message and I tell you
[1:05:22] what it was just powerful even to me
[1:05:24] today
[1:05:24] he took the parable where Jesus said
[1:05:27] Amen there was a man who own own this is
[1:05:31] his master and he asked his master to
[1:05:34] forgive him his master forgave him he
[1:05:37] said but he had a Stuart or Matt someone
[1:05:39] under him and and the fella couldn't
[1:05:42] come up with it's a payment so instead
[1:05:44] of forgiving him he not only beat him
[1:05:46] and he put him in prison but the news
[1:05:49] got back to the master what this guy had
[1:05:51] done you know what God did know what the
[1:05:53] master did he took back his forgiveness
[1:05:57] he took his forgiving his back you don't
[1:06:01] want God to take away if you can now he
[1:06:04] said if he said listen the Bible says if
[1:06:06] you can't forgive others neither can I
[1:06:09] forgive you forgiveness is not a option
[1:06:15] not for the men who want to make heaven
[1:06:18] what no matter what
[1:06:21] that's why Stephen said Lord Holies
[1:06:23] things not to their charge he knew it
[1:06:25] not it must ringing is here too
[1:06:27] if you can't forgive you eat your
[1:06:29] brother's neetha but cannot forgive you
[1:06:31] that's why Jesus said Father forgive
[1:06:33] them for they know not what they do
[1:06:34] that's bride who Illyria is that okay
[1:06:42] now he says listen and the first time
[1:06:46] for thousands of years 2500 years and
[1:06:48] Israel is a nation with its own flag own
[1:06:51] arm in all it's considered listen the
[1:06:54] oldest Israel so smart I mean you
[1:06:57] wouldn't have this everyone for Israel
[1:06:58] you wouldn't have your your phone if it
[1:07:00] wasn't for Israel your computer wouldn't
[1:07:02] even work as accurately as it does if it
[1:07:04] wasn't for Israel that's where the brain
[1:07:05] is
[1:07:06] he wouldn't had atomic bomb if it went
[1:07:08] forward you God don't bless the people
[1:07:13] and people jealous of them that's all it
[1:07:15] is
[1:07:16] they tell us that these people could go
[1:07:19] into a land that was bearing full of
[1:07:21] rocks nobody could do not Widom not the
[1:07:23] British not the Palestine nobody could
[1:07:25] do nothing with that land put Israel in
[1:07:27] there and blossom like a rose they can't
[1:07:31] stand it it's just jealousy hallelujah
[1:07:35] hey they're not messing with nobody it
[1:07:39] tried to welcome everybody that really
[1:07:41] do ah but these people they just is just
[1:07:44] that jealousy and it's the scripture
[1:07:48] being fulfilled hallelujah
[1:07:51] you got Jacob and Esau over there
[1:07:53] hallelujah and that's just that's just
[1:07:56] the way it is so right Isaac and Ishmael
[1:08:05] however you want to say it but those two
[1:08:07] spirits are still raining today but
[1:08:11] think about it that this whole world is
[1:08:14] gonna eventually hate the Jew even
[1:08:18] America will turn her back as soon as we
[1:08:21] do the bomb would drop because just as
[1:08:25] soon as we curse Israel God will curse
[1:08:27] us he'll release you take that blood
[1:08:29] away here take that veil of blood off of
[1:08:31] us and by the grace of God America
[1:08:34] hadn't seen nothing yet
[1:08:35] right oh we've been we've been isolated
[1:08:39] God has been protected because there's
[1:08:40] still Christians here but once the salt
[1:08:43] is removed once we removed from this
[1:08:45] place judgment is gonna fall hallelujah
[1:08:48] and God gonna make sure that everything
[1:08:51] shake you got you got mount st. Helen
[1:08:55] and and what's the other one a
[1:08:56] Yellowstone and they said when mama
[1:08:59] cried a sister answer or something like
[1:09:01] that the Indians have a say I say so
[1:09:03] when big sister cry little sister answer
[1:09:06] so you and I know by Gods
[1:09:10] this is going to be something else let
[1:09:17] me move on let me see you know what
[1:09:22] people don't understand you know we've
[1:09:23] got all these theologians if they really
[1:09:27] want to truth all they had to do is come
[1:09:28] ask us right we'll give them a few
[1:09:31] brother Browns book Church ages book
[1:09:32] sales books and all and then they
[1:09:34] wouldn't need this old big Obama store
[1:09:36] out there they got all these books and
[1:09:40] and you know us Christmas things that
[1:09:42] they can write they can help us but you
[1:09:44] got to understand that most of the
[1:09:46] things that right is not Holy Spirit
[1:09:48] it's psychology
[1:09:51] you don't need Christian science to live
[1:09:54] right you need the Holy Ghost to live
[1:09:55] right all your righteousness is that
[1:09:58] full filthy rags without the Holy Ghost
[1:10:03] hallelujah come on somebody God
[1:10:06] interprets his own word and it doesn't
[1:10:10] really matter
[1:10:11] amen how we can take this word and break
[1:10:13] it down and put it this way and put it
[1:10:15] that way when it comes down to the end
[1:10:17] of it God is gonna do it the way he
[1:10:19] wants to do it right Oh a virgin shall
[1:10:24] conceive you know that man crazy we
[1:10:27] thought he was a prophet until he said
[1:10:29] that four hundred years or eight hundred
[1:10:32] years I can't recall which it was amen
[1:10:34] and you know the Bible went into
[1:10:36] darkness the Bible said there's a time
[1:10:38] it meant that men followed after their
[1:10:41] own thoughts and ideas and they were
[1:10:43] right in their own eyes hallelujah can
[1:10:47] you imagine a man being without a real
[1:10:49] preacher four hundred years
[1:10:54] hallelujah she were all both there three
[1:10:59] hundred and something years because we
[1:11:00] hadn't been there that long God sent a
[1:11:03] prophet and God said when
[1:11:06] when the property came he said it was
[1:11:08] darkness ghosts are right but there
[1:11:13] shall be like hallelujah and you must
[1:11:16] understand you're that light that God
[1:11:19] has established in this dark age that's
[1:11:22] your light so shine among men hallelujah
[1:11:29] almost done with this section I'll pick
[1:11:33] up on Sunday but my point is this when
[1:11:37] God came to Abraham and Sarah
[1:11:39] they laughed Sarah laughed how can this
[1:11:43] thing be let me tell you of something
[1:11:46] God can drown a man with a drop of water
[1:11:52] in reality he doesn't really need a
[1:11:56] water he can cause his own fluids to
[1:11:58] drowning but God can do what he wants to
[1:12:02] do if God says that he's gonna perfect
[1:12:05] me and bring me to a place of
[1:12:07] translation I ain't laughing I'm saying
[1:12:11] hey man I don't need to know the
[1:12:14] mathematics behind it I don't even care
[1:12:19] how he does it he says it I believe it
[1:12:23] and I'm standing on his promises that's
[1:12:26] what I tell people because people think
[1:12:28] let me tell you something let me say
[1:12:29] this by knowing all of the word does not
[1:12:37] make you bride Paul said you can
[1:12:41] understand all mysteries and have not
[1:12:44] charity it profiteth you nothing what
[1:12:48] about the people who are even and
[1:12:49] unlearned and brother Branham preached
[1:12:52] and Africa the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:12:55] were they saying absolutely they were
[1:12:59] saying what about the eunuch the Bible
[1:13:05] never tells us what happened to him
[1:13:07] Philip baptized and he confess the Lord
[1:13:09] Jesus Christ Philip baptized him Andheri
[1:13:11] was gone
[1:13:12] he'll be there he didn't hear Paul's
[1:13:15] preaching as far as I know of Harley
[1:13:21] you are must understand let me read this
[1:13:23] code this is so good help me Lord I've
[1:13:26] got to go down to the bottom of this
[1:13:27] message new wine coming from the fourth
[1:13:41] seal brother brother L said listen now
[1:13:45] the power of revelation brings
[1:13:47] stimulation to the believer for the
[1:13:50] power of wine natural wine is to
[1:13:52] stimulate is to bring a person that's
[1:13:56] all slumped down to a stimulation well
[1:13:59] then there is a power of the revelation
[1:14:02] of the word it gives stimulation of joy
[1:14:06] to the believer stimulation of
[1:14:08] satisfaction satisfaction excuse me
[1:14:11] stimulation of satisfaction the
[1:14:13] stimulation that it vindicates it proves
[1:14:16] it calls in the scripture as we want to
[1:14:19] refer to it as a new why we always refer
[1:14:23] to it like that
[1:14:24] these are drunk or new wine what was new
[1:14:29] about what Peter preached cuz Peter
[1:14:32] preached that Jesus Christ was the Lamb
[1:14:34] of God it was already always in the
[1:14:40] scripture but he took the scripture this
[1:14:43] is that which was spoken by joelle in
[1:14:45] the last days that script was always
[1:14:49] there but Peter having the revelation
[1:14:51] that this was the time that this thing
[1:14:53] was being fulfilled made a new mine I've
[1:14:56] never heard that before
[1:14:58] it stimulated the people and after he
[1:15:01] after they heard they said well many
[1:15:03] brethren what must we do and when they
[1:15:06] said repent and be baptized an old bike
[1:15:08] God did they do it
[1:15:10] new wine hallelujah see this is what he
[1:15:21] says and as the natural wine reveals
[1:15:23] itself to stimulated power so does the
[1:15:26] new wine as it reveals the Word of God
[1:15:28] which is spirit see Oh
[1:15:31] please see the word itself
[1:15:33] is spirit I like that see because that
[1:15:38] is the new wine it is the spirit you
[1:15:44] believe that he said listen yeah then
[1:15:47] you you won't say well now somebody said
[1:15:50] that see let's see who said it and then
[1:15:53] we'll know whether it's true or not
[1:15:54] Saint John the sixth chapter the sixth
[1:15:57] chapter I believe it is 63rd verses it
[1:15:59] is the spirit that quickeneth but at
[1:16:03] that preacher was preaching the word it
[1:16:05] is the word spirit that's how people get
[1:16:10] the holy goes above said the word and
[1:16:13] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:16] because the world that they were
[1:16:18] speaking was wise but he was spirit and
[1:16:21] that whole egos went from the mouth to
[1:16:24] the heart hallelujah that's the real way
[1:16:28] of receiving the Holy Ghost by way of
[1:16:31] the preaching and if you can allow
[1:16:34] yourself to believe that that word is
[1:16:36] God and that word is telling you you're
[1:16:38] perfect you innocent you high every
[1:16:40] comes across the pulpit you're justified
[1:16:43] is the word I'm in you take that word
[1:16:46] that word strikes you and it comes to
[1:16:47] life
[1:16:48] might make you cry and make might make
[1:16:52] you shout you know it y'all don't
[1:16:55] understand what the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:57] sometimes we think the Holy Ghost is in
[1:16:59] us and all of a sudden you're perfect no
[1:17:01] and sometimes we think the Holy Ghost
[1:17:04] get to get us to a place Amen that we
[1:17:07] can't make mistakes
[1:17:08] no God told brother branham he had the
[1:17:10] Holy Ghost did he not and I used this
[1:17:12] the other day he said if you don't move
[1:17:14] out of Jeffersonville and move out west
[1:17:17] you're gonna beat that man up God told
[1:17:20] him how he's gonna beat him up kick him
[1:17:22] down the hill and right the angel the
[1:17:27] law said if you don't do it this is what
[1:17:28] what is going to happen did brother
[1:17:31] Brandon had the Holy Ghost of course he
[1:17:34] did but what about that man who died a
[1:17:37] drunk at the preacher and but God
[1:17:42] brem said no the man saved god couldn't
[1:17:45] get in the bread repent so he put him to
[1:17:47] sleep like a a parent would spank a
[1:17:48] child and put them to sleep I didn't go
[1:17:54] lose none not one see the reason why you
[1:18:00] and I we understand this thing is
[1:18:02] election anything about her works it's
[1:18:05] good to be obedient but that's not what
[1:18:08] saved you oh I love that thought so you
[1:18:13] know what God never did tell King give
[1:18:16] him a revelation of it he just told him
[1:18:18] what to do he gave him instructions and
[1:18:20] that's what's happening with a lot of
[1:18:21] people in the message they getting the
[1:18:23] instructions but they don't have a
[1:18:24] revelation of what they're preaching the
[1:18:29] revelation that I'm preaching is not
[1:18:31] about William Bramley is about you
[1:18:33] Christ in you the hope of glory thank
[1:18:35] God for William Branham y'all understand
[1:18:38] me see people not being spiritual they
[1:18:40] think I'm down in the Prophet you're
[1:18:42] wrong
[1:18:44] sometimes they think I'm disrespecting
[1:18:46] him you're wrong he says the people
[1:18:50] don't understand they haven't lifted it
[1:18:53] they put him in a place that he don't
[1:18:54] even want to be Yoshi a book brother
[1:18:56] Brennan says forget about me what about
[1:18:59] that quote I had people coming to church
[1:19:06] instead where's the cloud where's the
[1:19:08] cloud like the cloud makes this a
[1:19:09] message Church what makes you a message
[1:19:12] churches when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:14] brother BAM called this message he said
[1:19:17] it is my Holy Ghost message oh we don't
[1:19:23] need no Creed's we don't need all the
[1:19:26] dog when we got enough stuff we fight
[1:19:27] where that was a quote I like the spirit
[1:19:35] the word is spirit and the Bible said
[1:19:37] the word is spirit it is the thing that
[1:19:38] quickens you that's why when we hear
[1:19:41] that where we know how to lose something
[1:19:43] just move and it's the truth that's my
[1:19:48] good I love that Atlas I love being in
[1:19:51] the in the atmosphere of the word more
[1:19:53] than I love being anywhere else
[1:19:54] you love the Lord I'm cutting this short
[1:19:58] now I'll finish it on Sunday Lord's will
[1:20:02] but now is the time
[1:20:05] what day are you living in that Sloan
[1:20:08] says this day will not take us like a
[1:20:11] thief in the night you cannot be that
[1:20:15] blind to see that the Lord is not soon
[1:20:18] to come and we're right at the edge of a
[1:20:21] translation brother Brennan said garden
[1:20:25] go send that out pouring on us because
[1:20:26] we've been so good is that that's what
[1:20:29] he said

[1:22:03] you go fight Lucifer you
[1:22:08] Oh David he whipped Goliath because God
[1:22:12] was in him you whipping the devil now
[1:22:15] only because God how many of us know the
[1:22:19] word and sometimes the enemy catches
[1:22:21] herself garden but if God hasn't build a
[1:22:26] fire around you people I want you to
[1:22:32] understand this message is the greatest
[1:22:35] thing it is set us free if we could only
[1:22:37] see how free we are that's why nobody
[1:22:43] came yeah no I don't been on dominating
[1:22:47] spirits before I came to the Apostolic
[1:22:51] that's worse than the Pentecostals and
[1:22:56] you don't even you know they the
[1:22:58] sweetest people you ever seen until you
[1:23:00] cross oh hey brother I understand you

[1:23:04] something on your hand I mean it was
[1:23:09] legal yes sir
[1:23:11] and it put it in you so much that you
[1:23:13] actually thought that's really what you
[1:23:15] wanted to yeah I understand me so I know
[1:23:20] what dominate I could write off nobody
[1:23:24] controls you not me I don't try to
[1:23:27] control you nobody controls you your
[1:23:32] head is Christ I'll tell you by God's
[1:23:35] grace what the word says but when it
[1:23:37] comes to somebody controlling you and
[1:23:39] trying to make you do something I'm not
[1:23:41] one of them that's why you saw well
[1:23:44] you're not a sister dear wearing them
[1:23:45] how your shoes no I can't make her stop
[1:23:47] if God don't tell her to do it I'm gonna
[1:23:51] make all hypocrite people need Holy
[1:23:53] Ghost if they not that they don't have
[1:23:57] sometimes people just got justification
[1:23:59] but you need to come all the way up
[1:24:02] don't get me wrong folks they'll
[1:24:04] tree-huggers they the chain is no strong
[1:24:07] no stronger than its weakest link right
[1:24:10] I mean it doesn't mean that you're not
[1:24:12] climbing up here you doesn't mean you
[1:24:14] don't have faith it doesn't mean you
[1:24:15] have verse your knowledge it doesn't
[1:24:17] mean you don't have temper but sometimes
[1:24:19] we patients get us
[1:24:22] sometimes we're stuck with godliness but
[1:24:26] it doesn't mean you don't have the
[1:24:27] others see it's that Wheatley that's
[1:24:32] holding you back that you've got to
[1:24:34] overcome it's a victory and when you
[1:24:40] find yourself being tipped in a certain
[1:24:42] area you got the call like this song say
[1:24:47] you got the call on the chain breaker he
[1:24:52] breaks the chain don't let the devil
[1:24:57] steal from you like you ain't got
[1:24:58] nothing it appears that way when you
[1:25:02] fall but that's not true
[1:25:07] you got more God going with you than the
[1:25:09] other cuz you let me tell you something
[1:25:11] if God has elected you to be bribed
[1:25:12] ain't nothin gonna stop it anyhow
[1:25:14] blessed an I love this promise you I
[1:25:20] love this promise I love it the way
[1:25:23] mayor says Lord you know I never knew a
[1:25:25] man how can this thing be I don't
[1:25:28] understand it all the be done to me
[1:25:30] according to your word that's all I'm
[1:25:32] saying
[1:25:33] and whatever God does let him do it
[1:25:37] you're gonna suffer you're gonna go
[1:25:39] through it why do we feel like we're
[1:25:40] gonna make heaven on such a flower bed
[1:25:42] of ease when God is going through
[1:25:44] Calvary and everything else suffer
[1:25:46] through all of our things that we do I
[1:25:49] mean can you imagine a God that loves so
[1:25:51] much don't know nothing but love and yet
[1:25:53] instead we disappoint him every day he
[1:25:56] loved us anyhow that's why the Word of
[1:26:00] God said we're supposed to love each
[1:26:01] other like God loves us you don't want
[1:26:04] to be disappointed but I'm so sorry
[1:26:07] that's part of your growing up
[1:26:08] hallelujah if you have children they're
[1:26:12] gonna disappoint you ain't gonna do
[1:26:14] everything you want them to do I didn't
[1:26:16] do everything my mama wanted me to do
[1:26:18] and it beats goes on until God break on
[1:26:23] a change you just wait for the change

[1:26:42] you're in the middle where the piece is
[1:26:43] I said well I'm not sure I'm in the
[1:26:48] middle then but the point is I never
[1:26:52] come from every area and then a brother
[1:26:54] called me today and I'm like oh his
[1:26:56] troubles are worse than mine so hey I'm

[1:27:56] merciful to us give us grace to see and
[1:28:00] to understand and to love you in spite
[1:28:02] of all the things we go through this is
[1:28:05] a hard way we chose the harder way I'd
[1:28:09] rather the harder way because at least I
[1:28:13] know Lord it is the right way so many
[1:28:19] fish Oh God can swim downstream but only
[1:28:21] a special kind of fish can go upstream
