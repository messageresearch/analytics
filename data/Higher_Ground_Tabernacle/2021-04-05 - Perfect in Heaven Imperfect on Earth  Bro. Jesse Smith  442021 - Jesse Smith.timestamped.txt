[35:44] the talent in which they have
[35:47] you know words cannot express my
[35:48] gratitude
[35:51] when it comes to what we have heard
[35:54] these
[35:54] couple of days it has been life-changing
[35:58] for me
[35:59] and i just thank god for his grace and i
[36:02] believe with all my heart what was
[36:04] ministered especially this morning
[36:06] was something that everybody needed uh
[36:08] because
[36:09] you know we we all being in this house
[36:12] of flesh
[36:12] we we we we need jesus
[36:16] and most of all we need his blood we
[36:18] need the covenant
[36:19] we need an unconditional one i'm not the
[36:22] preacher but i'll tell you what i can't
[36:24] hardly wait till he gets up here
[36:26] amen we share the same holy ghost that's
[36:28] right i don't know how that's done but
[36:30] we do we all do and we just thank god
[36:33] for his mercy and his grace
[36:35] brother jesse means a lot to me we've
[36:37] been friends
[36:39] and brothers for a long time it's so
[36:40] amazing because
[36:42] um
[36:45] i would say almost twice his age
[36:49] but nevertheless we have been friends
[36:51] and you know
[36:52] there's a time when brother troy myself
[36:55] and jesse went over we were in guyana
[36:57] and we
[36:57] bonded in such a way we had a wonderful
[37:00] time and
[37:01] you know i sat back as they were being
[37:03] eaten up by the mosquitoes
[37:06] god was good to me i spoke to the
[37:08] mosquitoes
[37:11] i said i'm a servant of the lord you
[37:12] can't touch me
[37:14] by god's grace i came out squeaky clean
[37:19] you know sounds crazy but i believe like
[37:21] he said life and death
[37:23] is when they're done tonight and the
[37:24] lord told me to talk to him if i feel
[37:26] good the prophet can speak to bees i can
[37:27] speak to the mosquitoes
[37:29] so i know that sounds crazy but it's
[37:31] real
[37:33] we love the lord and we're not going to
[37:34] prolong the time we just say continue to
[37:36] pray for him
[37:38] that god will continue to bless him and
[37:39] strengthen him
[37:41] sometimes we don't know how tired we are
[37:42] until the meeting is over
[37:44] we're on the plane going back home and
[37:46] we feel like we almost can't make it to
[37:48] get
[37:49] you know once we hear so anyway we thank
[37:51] god for him we ask him to come forth
[37:53] amen sing preach whatever he wants to do
[37:56] this is the last service before it's
[37:59] ended here
[38:00] and uh truly i believe with all my heart
[38:03] i know that god
[38:04] allowed him to come hard to get him here
[38:07] but we finally got him
[38:08] showed that prayer changes things we
[38:11] thank god for him we love him
[38:13] we ask that you come brother amen god
[38:15] bless you sir
[38:16] take care
[38:22] [Music]
[38:26] i took a picture of you all and i sent
[38:28] it to our song leader
[38:29] because he's got a vision of what he
[38:31] wants our musicians to be like i said
[38:33] that's right that's where it is right
[38:34] there
[38:35] right there yes sir yes sir appreciate
[38:38] you brothers
[38:40] my what a blessing you're in the house
[38:42] of god serving god like this beautiful
[38:45] let's go to uh
[38:49] a scripture i'd like to go to job
[38:50] chapter one i've had this message i
[38:52] preached it at
[38:54] cam church partially and then i preached
[38:56] it at our church
[38:58] it's been a tremendous blessing to me
[39:01] you know you go on and you serve the
[39:03] lord years and years and years
[39:04] and then there are certain things that
[39:06] just there's such great revelations they
[39:08] stand out
[39:10] and to me this was one of them about job
[39:14] uh so my topic is is perfect in heaven
[39:18] imperfect on earth so
[39:22] perfect in heaven but imperfect
[39:25] on earth so i hope this will be a
[39:28] blessing to you it seems like when i
[39:30] do that it's too loud so i'm sorry if
[39:32] i'm i don't mean to blast anybody if i
[39:34] do that so
[39:36] just love everybody in the lord just
[39:39] love everybody the lord okay
[39:43] okay sorry about that buddy job chapter
[39:47] one
[39:47] so my topic is perfect in heaven
[39:49] imperfect on earth
[39:51] and a subtopic this is what came to me
[39:54] job's victory over lodesian conditions
[39:59] i never saw job as me before but now i
[40:02] can see
[40:02] job overcoming laodicea
[40:08] rich and increase with goods have need
[40:11] of nothing
[40:12] but he had to overcome that how many
[40:14] want to overcome that in our day
[40:16] god bless you job chapter 1
[40:19] verse 8.
[40:29] god does great things on sunday night
[40:30] services
[40:32] we have we have them every sunday we
[40:34] have 11 a.m and 4 p.m service
[40:36] every sunday now they're cancelling
[40:38] today so they can go have lunch with
[40:39] their families but
[40:40] every other sunday we are in the house
[40:42] of god because i learned if i don't give
[40:44] god the whole day i'll start working
[40:48] and then i don't have a sabbath right
[40:50] and the holy ghost came to give us a
[40:52] sabbath in our souls
[40:54] but i also realized my body needs a
[40:55] sabbath
[40:57] i got to have a day of rest
[41:01] and so brother branham had two services
[41:05] and so i want to follow that example
[41:06] praise god i want to give god the whole
[41:08] day
[41:08] job 1 verse 8.
[41:13] let's read this together just verse 8
[41:14] let's read it together on 3
[41:16] 1 2 3 and the lord said
[41:19] unto satan hast thou considered
[41:22] my servant job that there is none like
[41:25] him
[41:25] in the earth a perfect and upright
[41:29] man one that feareth god and a skeweth
[41:33] evil escue with evil
[41:39] now go to job 38.
[41:48] i trust by the end of this you'll see
[41:51] the revelation behind this
[41:52] imagine i could just say like this it's
[41:54] the power in the blood
[41:56] we just sang about the blood brother
[41:59] perfect
[41:59] fitting for this message the power
[42:03] in the blood job 38
[42:07] now when we read this remember who's god
[42:09] talking to here job
[42:11] who is he talking to another verse satan
[42:15] so when he speaks to satan he said job
[42:17] is perfect
[42:19] nothing wrong with his life he's
[42:22] completed
[42:24] but watch how job is talked to by god
[42:28] verse 1 then the lord answered job out
[42:31] of the whirlwind
[42:32] and said who is this
[42:36] that darkeneth counsel by words
[42:40] without knowledge gird up now
[42:43] thy loins he's talking to job gird up
[42:45] thyloines
[42:48] like a man for i will demand of thee
[42:52] and answer thou me
[42:55] the hebrew meaning of darkeneth is hide
[42:58] or confuse
[42:59] advice who is this that's hiding
[43:03] the sound advice who is this who's
[43:06] confusing
[43:07] with wrong advice
[43:10] yet he just called him perfect in heaven
[43:15] let's have a word of prayer here if you
[43:16] ever need on your heart let's just make
[43:17] it known unto god
[43:19] heavenly father we just come reverently
[43:21] before the throne of grace
[43:22] we thank you lord for the songs that
[43:24] have been sung they've refreshed our
[43:25] hearts lord god
[43:27] they've brought us into your presence
[43:29] and here we are in your presence
[43:30] we're thankful for the blood lord when
[43:33] you see the blood you'll pass over us
[43:35] thank you god
[43:36] for letting the blood lord the life of
[43:39] the blood speak to us today father
[43:42] lord it saved our souls it sanctified us
[43:45] it filled us with the spirit dear god
[43:47] we're so grateful
[43:48] yet we still need your instructions so
[43:50] lord we just pray by the holy spirit
[43:53] your blood would speak to us today
[43:55] father god bless your people
[43:57] lord i know sunday nights can be a
[44:00] challenging service but lord there can
[44:02] also be such a blessing if we all get
[44:03] one accord so help us to be in one
[44:06] accord tonight
[44:07] and father speak to us through your word
[44:09] in jesus christ's name
[44:10] and the saint said amen god bless you as
[44:12] you're being seated praise god
[44:16] it's good to see elijah and abraham god
[44:18] bless you brothers
[44:19] praise god sure love them and appreciate
[44:22] your testimony brother
[44:23] god bless you elijah great to pray with
[44:25] you yesterday brother that was a
[44:26] monumental
[44:27] day for us by god's grace beautiful day
[44:30] beautiful
[44:31] so thankful for his amazing grace god is
[44:34] so worthy to be praised
[44:37] so i'll set a timer here i just like to
[44:38] do that so i can keep track of myself
[44:40] and i don't wear you out too much
[44:42] brother brahm said some people fill up
[44:44] easy
[44:45] some people feel fill up with a lot
[44:48] in other words some people can only
[44:50] handle a little bit of preaching that's
[44:51] okay
[44:52] he said but some people need a lot of
[44:54] preaching
[44:55] because they got a real big appetite for
[44:57] the word
[44:59] i trust that by god's grace we'll be
[45:01] able to receive all that god has for us
[45:03] tonight
[45:05] praise god
[45:08] god tells satan job is perfect
[45:12] but when god comes to job he says who
[45:15] are you
[45:17] that confuses my advice
[45:20] who are you that hides knowledge
[45:25] what a striking thought how many ever
[45:27] consider that thought before you ever
[45:28] consider that thought
[45:31] we know the testimony god was bragging
[45:34] on job to satan
[45:36] he was proud of his of his child right
[45:40] he said he's just like me right he was
[45:43] bragging to satan
[45:45] because remember the how the the book
[45:46] opens job is blessed in all of his ways
[45:49] how many blessed in all your ways
[45:51] right and the bible said the sons of god
[45:55] came to present themselves before the
[45:57] lord and the lord asked them what have
[45:59] you been up to where you been going
[46:01] so we realize this son is not talking
[46:03] about us it's talking about angels
[46:06] praise god because brother brahm tells
[46:08] us in broken cisterns
[46:09] and also the church age book there's no
[46:11] such thing as pre-existence of souls
[46:14] where you were in a body before you came
[46:16] to earth
[46:17] he talks about it in who is this
[46:18] melchizedek he said jesus went the
[46:21] regular line
[46:22] from thought to theophany to flesh
[46:25] to glorified he said but we come a
[46:28] different way
[46:29] we come from thought to flesh
[46:33] then to theophany then to glorified amen
[46:36] hallelujah and so when the sons come to
[46:40] present themselves
[46:42] it's god showing he has control over all
[46:45] good angels
[46:46] and demons amen he forces them to come
[46:50] and present themselves
[46:52] and stand before him and he limits them
[46:54] praise god i'm saying
[46:55] hallelujah i'm so glad he restrains them
[46:58] praise god
[47:00] and it's true because god said or satan
[47:02] said well you've got a hedge around him
[47:04] thank god for the hedge of the blood
[47:06] amen hallelujah
[47:08] i'm more thankful for that than anything
[47:10] i know of praise god
[47:11] the hedge of jesus's blood protecting me
[47:14] from devils amen
[47:16] hallelujah they try to take your life
[47:17] they try to do different things and
[47:18] destroy you and
[47:19] car accidents and all these things but
[47:21] brother we've got a hedge around us
[47:23] it's the blood of jesus christ they come
[47:25] try to get to us and they're repelled
[47:27] right away
[47:28] amen because the blood of jesus christ
[47:30] hallelujah
[47:32] and god as the ruler of the universe
[47:33] makes them all stand and say what have
[47:35] you been up to
[47:37] says well i'm going to and fro he said
[47:39] have you considered my servant job
[47:42] there's none like him in all the world
[47:46] praise god well he said well that's
[47:48] because you protect him
[47:50] take all it away and he'll curse you to
[47:52] your face
[47:54] right and we know the story
[47:58] he gets he goes down there he takes
[48:00] job's children all these things
[48:01] job gets the victory at first right he
[48:03] gets the victory and he
[48:05] his children are lost but he praises the
[48:06] lord and he gives god glory he starts
[48:09] out those struggle
[48:10] he starts out to fight really good right
[48:13] and then the lord comes down again
[48:15] and allows some more he said but just
[48:16] don't touch his life
[48:19] then he's then his health leaves and
[48:22] he's covered in boils the bible said he
[48:24] had
[48:24] skin that was purple and black and
[48:26] peeling and it was
[48:28] it was just it was an awful condition
[48:30] historians say he struggled for nine
[48:33] months in that condition
[48:35] and the bible actually says months these
[48:37] months of my affliction and he didn't
[48:38] even go a year
[48:39] think about that some of you have been
[48:41] through years of pain
[48:44] job suffered awful but it was only about
[48:46] it wasn't even a year
[48:49] now look how merciful god is church look
[48:51] how merciful god is
[48:54] he's going to test his his child job but
[48:57] he doesn't let the test go too far
[48:58] because it's a really hard test
[49:00] and i want to say this job had great
[49:02] faith
[49:03] amen i'm never down in job i'm never
[49:06] down in john the baptist
[49:07] but we know what jesus said jesus said
[49:09] those in the kingdom of god
[49:10] are all greater than john the baptist if
[49:13] you're the least in the new testament
[49:14] you're still greater than the old
[49:16] testament because of the power of the
[49:18] blood amen praise god
[49:20] because we have we have access to more
[49:22] power than they have
[49:24] see david could slay the giant of
[49:26] goliath but he couldn't slay the giant
[49:28] of adultery
[49:29] and the church said that's why in the
[49:32] new testament
[49:32] we should have power to slay that giant
[49:35] too praise god
[49:36] brother ma'am said when i'm out on the
[49:38] field he said i might be
[49:39] uh tempted by a woman he said if i made
[49:42] a mistake i believe my wife would
[49:43] forgive me he said but my comforter
[49:45] won't let me do that
[49:47] hallelujah why because he's got greater
[49:49] power
[49:51] that's the difference of the new
[49:52] testament the power in the blood
[49:54] the power in the soul praise god amen
[49:59] and so we see the picture of job we know
[50:01] he was continually offering sacrifices
[50:04] and we just think oh we could never be
[50:05] like job i hope by the end of this
[50:07] you'll see you're a lot like job
[50:09] brother brooke said it earlier this
[50:10] morning he said we've got to constantly
[50:12] repent
[50:14] and that's what job was good at amen
[50:17] that's what that's what a reality was to
[50:19] job he had to constantly give offerings
[50:21] church we don't kill animals but we have
[50:24] to give a
[50:25] offering the bible said a sacrifice of
[50:27] praise is an offering
[50:28] a prayer is an offering it's incense
[50:31] coming up before god
[50:32] if we're not praying we're not giving
[50:34] sacrifices we've got to pray and we've
[50:36] got to sacrifice
[50:37] like job it's got to be continually
[50:39] praise god
[50:41] amen and he said that's a man he said
[50:44] that's perfect
[50:46] that's a man that skews evil
[50:49] that means he restrained and he avoided
[50:52] evil
[50:55] right like the bible said resist satan
[50:57] in other words fight back from
[50:59] fight back right and he'll flee but you
[51:01] got to fight it praise god
[51:03] you can't just give in to the sin you've
[51:04] got to fight against it praise god and
[51:06] that's how job was in many ways
[51:08] he resisted satan he escaped evil he
[51:11] hated evil
[51:12] he ran from it and god looked there in
[51:14] heaven said have you considered him he's
[51:15] my perfect son
[51:19] hallelujah because he was constantly
[51:22] offering blood sacrifices and let me say
[51:25] it like this
[51:26] if that was the power of animal blood
[51:28] what about the blood of jesus
[51:29] amen what is god saying about you
[51:33] if you're believing in the blood of
[51:35] jesus christ
[51:37] if you're constantly trusting in the
[51:39] blood of jesus christ
[51:40] what is jesus telling satan right now
[51:42] about you brother
[51:43] he's perfect amen have you considered my
[51:46] servant
[51:47] he's perfect praise god what is he
[51:49] saying
[51:50] he's got to be saying what the word says
[51:53] the bible said you have
[51:54] you you have no more uh transgressions
[51:57] praise god
[51:57] the bible said he's taken all
[51:59] unrighteousness away amen
[52:01] and you're walking the light as he is in
[52:03] the light
[52:04] amen what is he saying about us brother
[52:06] keith all these years what has god been
[52:08] saying about us in heaven brother
[52:10] brother brooks he's been saying he's
[52:12] perfect praise god
[52:14] and they're saying well you're
[52:15] protecting him well i thank the lord
[52:17] i've asked for protection praise god
[52:19] i don't want to serve the kingdom of
[52:20] darkness i want to say the kingdom of
[52:22] light
[52:24] like yesterday we saw it brother elijah
[52:26] you know i forgot to bring out this
[52:27] scripture
[52:28] the bible said this day i set before you
[52:30] blessing
[52:31] or curse choose you this day whom you
[52:34] will serve
[52:36] i want the blessing amen i want god's
[52:38] spirit praise god
[52:39] i want his anointing amen i want his
[52:42] love i use blood praise god
[52:44] i want to be perfect i want to be like
[52:46] jesus amen
[52:47] in fact i was made in this image praise
[52:49] god
[52:51] man is made in the image of god amen
[52:55] nothing wrong with wanting the blessings
[52:57] of god just know you got to have a few
[52:59] trials in between
[53:00] there you might have you might have to
[53:02] have a job trout god forbid
[53:03] but you might have to have a trial like
[53:05] that in order to prove
[53:07] what you are hallelujah
[53:11] so the point i'm making if you got your
[53:12] bible first john
[53:14] the point i want to make first john 3 9.
[53:18] i was talking about
[53:18] this with brother keith he talked about
[53:20] the seed when i was out there
[53:25] first john 3 9.
[53:36] do not let satan tell you you're lost
[53:41] do not let satan tell you you're not
[53:44] perfect
[53:45] you are perfect if job was perfect
[53:49] you're perfect if you're trusting in the
[53:52] same thing
[53:54] the blood amen
[53:57] hallelujah first john 3 9
[54:01] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[54:04] sin
[54:06] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[54:07] cannot sin because he's born of
[54:10] god a christian has three parts a soul
[54:15] spirit and body once the holy ghost
[54:18] comes into his soul
[54:20] it's sealed off from satan it's no
[54:23] longer a soul of
[54:24] unbelief like it was now it's a soul of
[54:27] faith or belief amen
[54:30] hallelujah praise god and then the bible
[54:32] said it has a new nature because bubba
[54:34] says your soul is your nature
[54:36] praise god now you have god's nature
[54:39] god's desires god's will amen
[54:43] and that soul doesn't sin what sins is
[54:46] our human spirit
[54:49] either consciously or unconsciously
[54:51] right because sometimes satan gets in
[54:52] there he can put bad dreams in there
[54:54] we didn't mean to do that we wake up in
[54:57] the was that
[54:58] how many times that happened to me i
[54:59] have awful dreams i wake up and think
[55:01] did i do that did i
[55:02] god have mercy i hope i didn't do that
[55:03] satan tried to put death in there so i
[55:05] said satan get behind me praise god
[55:07] hallelujah get behind me you have no
[55:09] power for me amen
[55:11] and i can be happy i didn't do that
[55:13] praise god jesus dropped the charges
[55:15] amen
[55:15] i never did that in the first place amen
[55:20] god for the blood amen that's right
[55:24] so the soul doesn't sin when you're born
[55:27] again
[55:29] because the bible said he's quickened
[55:31] your soul
[55:32] that means made alive now the nature or
[55:35] the will or desire of you
[55:37] is always god's will
[55:40] but you've got what we got to get our
[55:42] minds to overcome on the battlefield
[55:46] hallelujah we got to overcome in our
[55:49] minds
[55:50] that's why the bible said present your
[55:51] body as a living
[55:53] sacrifice unto god which is your
[55:55] reasonable service
[55:57] that you can have your mind transformed
[56:00] to prove the perfect will of god
[56:03] i'm not wondering if me being a pastor
[56:06] is the perfect will of god
[56:07] i proved it amen
[56:11] hallelujah before i ask god if i should
[56:13] pastor but elijah i prayed i opened my
[56:15] bible i said god just let me point to
[56:17] one scripture
[56:18] if it would encourage me if i should
[56:19] pass to the church open my bible i did
[56:21] that
[56:22] brother ram did it's the only time i've
[56:23] ever done it in my life so i'm not
[56:25] telling you to go do it but
[56:26] when you do it you better be sincere oh
[56:28] in fact it might have been
[56:30] a bible like that the scofield bible and
[56:32] it went to timothy turn to timothy real
[56:34] quick here
[56:36] went to timothy 1st timothy
[56:41] god knows my heart remember lydia was
[56:42] she might have been sitting there on the
[56:44] floor but she was so so tiny
[56:48] first timothy yep first timothy 4
[56:51] 12. i just opened i closed my eyes i
[56:54] pointed right there
[56:55] and i said i said that's the scripture
[56:58] let no man despise thy youth i started
[57:00] pastoring it 25 years old
[57:02] so many brothers you might be preaching
[57:04] pretty soon you might be pastoring
[57:05] pretty soon
[57:06] right so got to raise up another church
[57:07] somewhere who knows we'll see what god
[57:09] does
[57:10] but you need to be ready let no man
[57:13] despise your youth be an example of the
[57:14] believers in word and
[57:16] conversation and charity and spirit in
[57:18] faith and purity till i come give
[57:19] attendance to reading exhortation
[57:21] doctrine
[57:21] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[57:23] which was given thee by prophecy with
[57:25] the laying on the hands of the
[57:26] presbytery
[57:26] meditate upon these things give thyself
[57:28] holy to them that thy profiting may
[57:30] appear to all
[57:31] take heed unto thyself and unto the
[57:34] doctrine
[57:35] continue in them for in doing this thou
[57:37] shalt both save thyself
[57:38] and them that hear thee now i prayed
[57:42] numerous times god show me if i'm
[57:43] supposed to pastor
[57:44] and god would always always answer
[57:46] church you don't have to wonder if
[57:47] you're in god's perfect will or not you
[57:49] can prove it
[57:50] but you need a transformed mind your
[57:53] mind has to be
[57:54] that word transform means light jesus
[57:56] what it means transfigure jesus was
[57:58] transfigured before them all
[58:00] bright shining light like the sun so
[58:03] your mind has a time when it's dark we
[58:04] talked about this morning
[58:06] and then when it's transformed the light
[58:07] of god has entered your mind
[58:09] and now you understand the things of god
[58:11] the light has come
[58:12] there's no more question there's no more
[58:14] doubt about it the light shines and you
[58:16] can see hallelujah
[58:21] so that's the human spirit now the soul
[58:24] can never sin
[58:25] but the human spirit's got to be renewed
[58:27] daily you need a daily transformation or
[58:29] transfer transfiguration like jesus
[58:32] we need a daily experience where we go
[58:34] up in the presence of god and our minds
[58:35] are transformed
[58:37] right that's what the bible says be
[58:39] renewed in the spirit of your minds
[58:46] now you know the heavenly courtroom i
[58:49] talked about that talked about broken
[58:51] cisterns
[58:53] hallelujah
[58:56] now let's go to the book of job here
[59:00] we'll try to get through some numerous
[59:01] scriptures here i'm just trying to hit
[59:03] the highlights here
[59:04] go to job 2 verse 3.
[59:08] i want you to notice how does god prove
[59:12] job is a perfect man to the devil
[59:16] how does he prove that verse
[59:20] two chapter two verse three kind of
[59:23] mentioned it earlier
[59:24] and the lord said in the satan hast i
[59:25] consider my servant job that there's no
[59:27] man like him in the earth a perfect and
[59:29] an upright man
[59:31] one that feareth god and escu with evil
[59:33] and still he holds fast his integrity
[59:35] although thou movest me against him to
[59:37] destroy him without cause
[59:39] what was god's proof that he was a
[59:41] perfect man
[59:42] he hated evil praise god he
[59:46] feared god right
[59:49] what the bible says upright he did what
[59:52] was righteous
[59:54] now where was the signs miracles and
[59:55] wonders in there
[59:58] now if you if you if you do that they'll
[1:00:00] follow you praise god
[1:00:02] right but god never says well job did so
[1:00:05] many miracles because that would
[1:00:06] discount john the baptist because he
[1:00:07] didn't know miracles the bible says
[1:00:10] so don't worry about the miracles be
[1:00:12] concerned about fearing god
[1:00:14] living upright and separating yourself
[1:00:16] from evil influences
[1:00:19] and trusting in the blood in fact that's
[1:00:21] what the blood does
[1:00:22] the blood makes you want to separate
[1:00:24] amen the blood makes you want to live
[1:00:26] upright because you see
[1:00:28] something died in my place i should have
[1:00:30] died but something died for me
[1:00:32] and i'm living with gratitude because of
[1:00:34] that
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:39] so how does god prove you're perfect the
[1:00:42] blood
[1:00:43] and then the blood shows that you fear
[1:00:45] god you're upright and you separate
[1:00:47] yourself from evil
[1:00:49] you young brothers could be a lot of
[1:00:50] places tonight getting involved with
[1:00:51] evil
[1:00:52] but you you've escaped evil tonight god
[1:00:55] bless you for that
[1:00:56] you're on the road praise god you're on
[1:00:58] the right road now go to hebrews 13. i
[1:01:00] want to prove it to you as well
[1:01:03] hebrews 13.
[1:01:13] verse 20 hebrews 13 20. thanks for your
[1:01:15] patience here
[1:01:17] this one just come to my heart now the
[1:01:19] god of peace that brought again from the
[1:01:21] dead our lord jesus christ
[1:01:22] that great shepherd of the sheep through
[1:01:25] the blood of the
[1:01:26] everlasting covenant do what
[1:01:29] what is the blood of the everlasting
[1:01:31] covenant going to do saints
[1:01:33] oh hallelujah verse 21. what's it going
[1:01:35] to do it's going to make you
[1:01:37] perfect in every good work
[1:01:40] everything you do is going to be blessed
[1:01:42] hallelujah
[1:01:44] when you love god when you serve god
[1:01:46] everything your hand
[1:01:47] touches god is going to bless it amen
[1:01:50] and the blood is gonna make you perfect
[1:01:54] so when you're daily repenting daily
[1:01:56] seeking the kingdom of god
[1:01:58] saying god i'm seeking your
[1:01:59] righteousness i'm seeking jesus's
[1:02:02] integrity amen
[1:02:03] i'm seeking jesus's honesty i'm seeking
[1:02:06] jesus's humility amen
[1:02:09] i'm seeking jesus's righteousness i'm
[1:02:12] seeking jesus's humility
[1:02:14] who said let not my will be done but thy
[1:02:17] will
[1:02:17] amen when we seek that
[1:02:20] the blood of jesus makes us perfect
[1:02:24] and every work we do
[1:02:28] is perfect and it pleases god
[1:02:31] did you know that look at his says well
[1:02:34] pleasing in his sight
[1:02:36] working in that which is well pleasing
[1:02:37] his sight did you know
[1:02:40] in 1st timothy 2 paul tells them to pray
[1:02:42] for leaders and all these things
[1:02:45] he said and so that we can have a quiet
[1:02:48] and peaceable life which is well
[1:02:50] pleasing in the sight of god
[1:02:53] god looks down and he sees just a humble
[1:02:56] peaceful life
[1:02:57] just going about your day loving god
[1:02:59] witnessing testifying
[1:03:01] god sees that as well pleasing in his
[1:03:04] sight
[1:03:05] someone that can live in peace instead
[1:03:07] of war
[1:03:09] now we've got to have battles every now
[1:03:11] and then right in the churches and we
[1:03:12] got to overcome enemies
[1:03:13] but i said satan will anoint somebody
[1:03:15] with poison and send him into the church
[1:03:17] he said but you withstand him praise god
[1:03:19] amen god will take him out praise god
[1:03:24] but that's our desire if god is in you
[1:03:26] then you are trying to
[1:03:28] live a life of peace and the blood is
[1:03:31] gonna make your life
[1:03:32] perfect and everything you do god is
[1:03:35] gonna bless it
[1:03:36] and it's all gonna happen by the blood
[1:03:38] of jesus in other words the forgiveness
[1:03:40] of jesus
[1:03:42] how many thankful to be forgiven tonight
[1:03:44] glory
[1:03:47] sounds like heaven love job
[1:03:50] because god's up in heaven saying this
[1:03:52] is my son have you considered him
[1:03:55] how many know heaven loves you
[1:03:58] daniel 9 23 gabriel comes down and talks
[1:04:01] to
[1:04:01] daniel uh daniel 9 23 and he says
[1:04:05] remember he had to answer the prayer for
[1:04:06] three weeks because there's a spiritual
[1:04:08] battle going on
[1:04:09] and don't give up church if you haven't
[1:04:10] seen the answer to your prayers just
[1:04:12] keep battling in prayer
[1:04:14] there's spiritual wickedness going on in
[1:04:16] high places may god give us patience
[1:04:18] praise god
[1:04:19] may god give us longsuffering that we
[1:04:21] can suffer long amen
[1:04:23] and wait till we see a change in the
[1:04:24] people's lives

[1:07:02] seal
[1:07:03] those vials are poured out all those
[1:07:05] answers to all those prayers at the
[1:07:07] rapture
[1:07:07] are going to be poured out amen 2 000
[1:07:11] years of prayers about the rapture are
[1:07:14] going to be poured out at that time
[1:07:16] amen praise god it's a fire falling time
[1:07:20] amen it's the latter rain time amen
[1:07:23] it's the holy ghost falling time amen
[1:07:27] where we're swaddling up death is
[1:07:30] swallowed up in life amen
[1:07:32] hallelujah ah
[1:07:36] heaven is so close to us heaven is so
[1:07:38] real
[1:07:40] a couple months ago church my
[1:07:41] six-year-old daughter saw an angel right
[1:07:43] outside our house
[1:07:45] brother we've asked her four or five
[1:07:47] times every time the details
[1:07:49] are the same it matches brother
[1:07:51] branham's
[1:07:52] details almost perfectly she saw a
[1:07:56] vision
[1:07:57] my six-year-old and i was just preaching
[1:07:59] on how if you live the right life
[1:08:00] angels will visit your house hallelujah
[1:08:04] now we're praying he comes back amen but
[1:08:07] we know in one sense they never leave
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:11] right because there's angels guardian
[1:08:12] angels
[1:08:14] sent to us the bible said the angel of
[1:08:16] the lord
[1:08:17] encamps around those who fear fear the
[1:08:19] lord
[1:08:20] and that's right she just came up for
[1:08:21] prayer on friday night to get the holy
[1:08:22] ghost i don't think she got it
[1:08:24] but she come up just crying wanting the
[1:08:26] holy ghost
[1:08:27] my set now she's seven
[1:08:32] heaven loves you how do you know because
[1:08:35] they sent
[1:08:35] the greatest gift to pay for the price
[1:08:38] for your salvation praise god
[1:08:40] that's how you know the king left his
[1:08:43] throne in a spiritual sense right
[1:08:46] the king left the throne to come down
[1:08:48] and serve the people
[1:08:49] to be with the people amen to love his
[1:08:52] people praise god
[1:08:54] heaven come down to earth to bless us
[1:08:59] glory greatly beloved daniel greatly
[1:09:02] beloved bride of jesus christ
[1:09:04] you're greatly beloved how many believe
[1:09:06] that
[1:09:08] now the bible says they accuse satan
[1:09:10] accuses us
[1:09:12] day and night before god but we overcome
[1:09:16] him
[1:09:17] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:09:20] our testimony
[1:09:22] if god said that about job under the
[1:09:24] blood of bulls and goats
[1:09:25] he's got to say the same if not more
[1:09:28] about
[1:09:28] us under the blood of his son
[1:09:32] praise god
[1:09:35] now let me move to this thought here
[1:09:38] remember church we have an advocate with
[1:09:40] the father jesus christ the righteous
[1:09:42] he was made a propituation for our sins
[1:09:46] that means he was made a mercy seat for
[1:09:49] our sins
[1:09:49] the mercy seat covered the ark right it
[1:09:52] was just that top piece on the ark
[1:09:54] and that's where the blood had to be
[1:09:56] sprinkled
[1:09:57] jesus became the mercy seat that that
[1:10:01] lid as the lid
[1:10:02] it covered the law the law was saying
[1:10:04] judgment judgment you haven't kept it
[1:10:06] but the mercy seat was saying i'm gonna
[1:10:08] forgive you
[1:10:09] and that something's gonna die to take
[1:10:11] your place that you can still approach
[1:10:13] me amen
[1:10:15] jesus christ took our sins he took our
[1:10:18] shame praise god
[1:10:19] he's covering over our judgment but we
[1:10:21] know he does more than cover over it he
[1:10:23] abolishes it amen
[1:10:26] he abolishes it he was made the
[1:10:28] propitiation
[1:10:30] for our sins and not for ours only but
[1:10:33] also the sins of the whole world
[1:10:36] if they'll receive him thank god
[1:10:39] for the advocate jesus christ now church
[1:10:42] job's life
[1:10:43] was he's the ultimate christian
[1:10:45] businessman i heard a preacher say that
[1:10:48] he was the most spiritual man in god's
[1:10:50] sight
[1:10:51] now i'm not going to get into
[1:10:52] comparisons but if god had
[1:10:54] the most spiritual people in that day i
[1:10:56] wonder who the most spiritual
[1:10:58] people are today it's those that ask
[1:11:01] evil it's those that fear the lord
[1:11:06] praise god so god has a man today
[1:11:09] praise god god has men today who's the
[1:11:12] most spiritual men of that day
[1:11:15] god has an order i just hope i'm in the
[1:11:17] order somewhere i'm probably the last
[1:11:19] one
[1:11:19] but if i'm in that order hallelujah i'll
[1:11:22] be the happiest man
[1:11:23] there ever was amen but there's an
[1:11:26] order of people that serve the lord
[1:11:30] and job was at the very top
[1:11:33] because god god numbers the very hairs
[1:11:37] on our heads so god has a number
[1:11:40] mine keep falling out you know but you
[1:11:42] know i got a pretty good amount you know
[1:11:44] hopefully thankfully they haven't fought
[1:11:45] out too much but if god knows all these
[1:11:48] numbers and all these things
[1:11:49] then he knows those faithful servants
[1:11:51] who are praying
[1:11:52] fasting given alms and they all rank
[1:11:55] in god's kingdom some are more spiritual
[1:11:58] than others
[1:11:59] job was the most spiritual of all of
[1:12:02] them
[1:12:04] oh god help us to be spiritual
[1:12:08] it's not a competition
[1:12:11] brother man say you do works because you
[1:12:13] are saved
[1:12:15] and paul said i labor more because grace
[1:12:18] was with me
[1:12:20] see when you live by grace you want to
[1:12:22] do more for the kingdom of god
[1:12:28] i'll make sure i want to bring that
[1:12:30] thought out he's the most prosperous man
[1:12:32] most beautiful family
[1:12:33] loving servants a man of worship he
[1:12:35] didn't take the salvation of his
[1:12:36] children for granted he kept praying for
[1:12:38] his children
[1:12:39] right now we don't have time to go
[1:12:42] through this but here are some of his
[1:12:44] godly attributes
[1:12:45] job job
[1:12:49] was the definition of living with
[1:12:51] eternal life
[1:12:52] the bible says in chapter 29 verse 13 he
[1:12:56] made
[1:12:56] widows and the fatherless sing and
[1:12:59] rejoice
[1:13:01] so he would go visit the widows in the
[1:13:03] church and give them things and help
[1:13:05] them out
[1:13:06] he would go visit the children that had
[1:13:07] no dads
[1:13:09] and he would go visit them and help them
[1:13:11] out
[1:13:13] the bible said he loved his enemies in
[1:13:15] job 31 verse 29.
[1:13:20] the bible said he did not trust in
[1:13:22] riches in job 31 verses 24 and 25
[1:13:25] and then the in chapter 31 verse 32 the
[1:13:28] bible said he helped strangers
[1:13:32] now we're starting to measure ourselves
[1:13:33] up aren't we i see each person kind of
[1:13:35] calculating their minds
[1:13:39] we should we ought to we ought to do
[1:13:42] good works
[1:13:44] a christian we do good works amen
[1:13:48] job was a godly man he overcame listen
[1:13:51] this
[1:13:52] brothers he overcame sexual thoughts
[1:13:55] about other women
[1:13:58] the bible said i made a covenant not to
[1:14:00] look upon a maid now you talk about
[1:14:02] a spiritual man
[1:14:05] he had all these outward victories and
[1:14:07] he also had
[1:14:08] inward victories
[1:14:12] now remember church he was sanctified
[1:14:13] but he could never be filled with the
[1:14:15] holy ghost
[1:14:16] because jesus hadn't paid for sins yet
[1:14:19] turn your bibles to john 7 37 let's read
[1:14:22] that so you got it brother branham says
[1:14:23] it too
[1:14:24] on multiple occasions i've got like
[1:14:26] three occasions where he said
[1:14:28] that i appreciate your attention
[1:14:30] everybody's doing a great job here
[1:14:32] i know it's sunday night i've lived
[1:14:33] through them i've you're doing good by
[1:14:35] god's grace
[1:14:36] amen john 7 37-39
[1:14:43] just stay with me stay with the word
[1:14:45] keep hungering and thirsting for
[1:14:46] righteousness praise god
[1:14:49] in the last day that great day of the
[1:14:51] feast jesus said and cried saying if any
[1:14:52] man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:14:53] drink
[1:14:54] he that believeth on me now do you catch
[1:14:56] any man
[1:14:57] right there amen he just offered any man
[1:15:00] come and take the holy ghost
[1:15:02] everybody's welcome praise god now he
[1:15:04] knows who's going to come
[1:15:06] but the invitation has to go to oil
[1:15:09] so don't let satan ever tell you god
[1:15:11] don't want you to get the holy ghost god
[1:15:13] does want you to get the holy ghost
[1:15:15] praise god
[1:15:15] he said any man let him come and drink
[1:15:18] of these fresh waters of life
[1:15:20] you'll never be the same you'll never
[1:15:22] thirst for the world again amen
[1:15:27] look at the next verse verse 39 can you
[1:15:30] pull it up there
[1:15:31] but this hate speaking of the spirit
[1:15:32] which they that believe on him should
[1:15:33] receive for
[1:15:34] the holy ghost was not yet given because
[1:15:36] that jesus was not yet glorified
[1:15:39] when john the baptist was full of the
[1:15:40] holy ghost when his mother elizabeth and
[1:15:43] his dad zacharias were filled with the
[1:15:45] holy ghost
[1:15:45] it wasn't in their soul it was in their
[1:15:48] human spirit
[1:15:50] god couldn't fill them in their soul yet
[1:15:52] because jesus had not paid
[1:15:54] all the sacrifice for sin praise god
[1:15:57] that's why when jesus rose he knew the
[1:16:00] blood was accepted he took his own blood
[1:16:01] to heaven
[1:16:02] present to the father and then he
[1:16:03] breathed on and said receive the holy
[1:16:06] ghost
[1:16:06] receive it now because heaven's
[1:16:08] sacrifice has been accepted praise god
[1:16:12] god's sacrifice has been accepted now
[1:16:14] you can receive
[1:16:15] the baptism of the holy ghost amen so
[1:16:18] job
[1:16:18] church job could be so sanctified he had
[1:16:21] faith virtue now now look temperance
[1:16:23] he didn't lust after other women
[1:16:25] temperance means you have power
[1:16:27] over bodily passions like lust of the
[1:16:29] eyes
[1:16:30] right pride of life lust of the lust of
[1:16:32] the body so
[1:16:34] job was all over look at him broadly
[1:16:36] kindness and look at godliness
[1:16:37] look at his the bible said the patience
[1:16:39] of job
[1:16:41] without the baptism in the soul he was
[1:16:43] able to live such a high life
[1:16:45] what can we live amen with the baptism
[1:16:48] of the holy ghost in our soul praise god
[1:16:54] hallelujah church my
[1:16:57] my desires my goal is living a much
[1:16:59] higher life
[1:17:00] than i'm living right now and i know
[1:17:03] it's possible
[1:17:04] because jesus said all things are
[1:17:05] possible to them that believe
[1:17:08] hallelujah let's not get the solomon
[1:17:11] syndrome
[1:17:12] the solomon syndrome is when you get old
[1:17:15] things turn your
[1:17:16] hearts away from the lord his many wives
[1:17:22] turned his heart away from the lord it's
[1:17:24] the same thing that happened to uzziah
[1:17:26] the bible said as long as he sought the
[1:17:28] lord he prospered
[1:17:29] but when he desired to become a priest
[1:17:32] and left his position
[1:17:34] then god stopped blessing him he went in
[1:17:36] there and offered incense
[1:17:37] and he was smote with leprosy what a sad
[1:17:40] ending to our life
[1:17:41] to a life that is we don't want a sad
[1:17:43] ending to our life
[1:17:44] we want a crowning to our life amen
[1:17:48] right we don't want a life that's
[1:17:49] crowding in disgrace
[1:17:51] oh my i'll say like this church the best
[1:17:53] is yet to come for your life
[1:17:55] i'm going to preach at home when i get
[1:17:56] home i just caught that thought the best
[1:17:58] is yet to come you say prove it i'll be
[1:18:01] happy to prove it
[1:18:02] moses the first 40 years of his life not
[1:18:05] so good second
[1:18:06] 40 well he's a father now but the last
[1:18:09] part of his life
[1:18:10] was the best part of his life amen
[1:18:13] abraham first 75 years
[1:18:16] but those last uh 25 35 years
[1:18:20] was the best part of his life he was
[1:18:22] walking and thus saith the lord
[1:18:25] amen god would visit him and say go move
[1:18:27] here and go to this and separate
[1:18:28] yourself
[1:18:29] he was walking in the word of the lord
[1:18:32] hallelujah brother branham
[1:18:36] he thanked god for the first full second
[1:18:38] paul but he said that third poll
[1:18:40] is the thing i've waited for and
[1:18:42] wondered about all my life
[1:18:43] amen the opening of the way praise god
[1:18:47] the opening of the revelations of god
[1:18:49] speaking the word having the power
[1:18:51] of the word of god but told this story
[1:18:54] about a preacher i think it was billy
[1:18:55] sunday or maybe another preacher
[1:18:57] he was on his deathbed and all of his
[1:19:00] comforters you know i had his deathbed
[1:19:01] were saying
[1:19:02] you know you're going to go you're going
[1:19:03] to be saved and everything and they said
[1:19:05] what was the best time of your life was
[1:19:07] it when you were 25 and
[1:19:08] all strong and preaching the word when
[1:19:10] was the best time in your life
[1:19:12] was it when you were you know like 30 or
[1:19:13] 40
[1:19:15] and the brother said what are you crazy
[1:19:17] he said this is the best time of my life
[1:19:20] he said because in five minutes i'll see
[1:19:22] jesus christ i'll see him face to face
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:26] the best is always yet to come amen
[1:19:29] this bride is receiving her former reign
[1:19:32] the teaching reign but let me tell you
[1:19:34] the best is yet to come the lettering
[1:19:36] rapturing faith amen
[1:19:39] the best is always yet to come
[1:19:44] right now it's great it's greater than
[1:19:47] it was before because i'm sharpening
[1:19:48] eight arrows at my house brother isaiah
[1:19:51] i'm sharpening them
[1:19:54] and one day i'm gonna release them out
[1:19:58] at the gates of the city brother keith
[1:20:02] so when i'm a grandfather and i when i'm
[1:20:05] a grant lord willing to see if the lord
[1:20:06] tarries
[1:20:08] kind of maybe i'm prophesied but you
[1:20:11] know
[1:20:11] i'll shoot him out as a young man third
[1:20:13] i'm 40. in 10 years or so i'll be
[1:20:15] shooting some of these
[1:20:16] arrows out but when i'm a grandfather
[1:20:19] my children will be raised up they'll
[1:20:21] have victories in their lives if the
[1:20:23] lord is willing and of lord teres and
[1:20:25] then they'll be sharpening arrows for
[1:20:26] the next generation
[1:20:29] so see each each stage of our life is
[1:20:31] the best stage
[1:20:33] because you can see the testimonies of
[1:20:35] your life
[1:20:36] compile up over the years praise god
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:40] and then the closer you get to death the
[1:20:41] closer you get to see jesus
[1:20:43] amen hallelujah
[1:20:46] the best is always yet to come always
[1:20:50] don't let satan tell you it was better
[1:20:52] back then now that could be true for
[1:20:54] someone like solomon
[1:20:55] so the thing to do is repent
[1:20:59] right look at david's life now his was
[1:21:01] kind of
[1:21:02] he kind of that solomon thing he
[1:21:04] committed
[1:21:05] adultery and then he numbered the people
[1:21:08] i forgot how many people thousands of
[1:21:09] people died 75
[1:21:10] 000 or something like that 70 000. he
[1:21:14] kind of backs a little bit at the end of
[1:21:15] his life too but may god help us not to
[1:21:18] backslide
[1:21:19] me included all of us may god help all
[1:21:21] of us to just stay as pure
[1:21:23] and as faithful and true as we possibly
[1:21:26] can
[1:21:26] because the best is yet to come church
[1:21:31] i believe that i receive that by god's
[1:21:33] grace i know that's true
[1:21:37] now let me keep going here by god's
[1:21:38] grace so see we are perfect in the soul
[1:21:41] but our minds and our bodies and we're
[1:21:43] perfect in heaven but our minds and
[1:21:45] bodies are not perfect on earth
[1:21:48] if we say we have sin or we don't have
[1:21:50] sin we make him a liar and his word is
[1:21:52] not in us
[1:21:56] now church i want to just for time's
[1:21:58] sake i want to look at this
[1:21:59] brother abraham says this i'm going to
[1:22:00] read this in the book of job this is
[1:22:03] from perfect faith
[1:22:05] it says job feared and what he feared
[1:22:08] but abandoned says it actually happened
[1:22:11] what brought it
[1:22:12] brother ma'am says his fear that's what
[1:22:16] made it happen
[1:22:20] his faith would have kept him from it
[1:22:22] but his fear
[1:22:23] brought him brought it to him he was
[1:22:26] scared it was going to happen and it did
[1:22:27] happen
[1:22:28] now if he knowed it when it happened it
[1:22:30] wouldn't happen see what i mean
[1:22:31] if you're afraid when you come by a
[1:22:33] prayer line maybe i won't haven't got
[1:22:35] the faith sufficient it'll never happen
[1:22:36] don't worry
[1:22:37] but if you know it's going to happen
[1:22:39] it'll happen see it's a substance of
[1:22:41] something
[1:22:42] job had a fear that these things would
[1:22:43] come upon him and they did
[1:22:45] if you have a fear your disease is going
[1:22:46] to leave you then it or leave won't
[1:22:48] leave you it won't
[1:22:49] if you have faith it will
[1:22:54] hallelujah
[1:22:58] now get your bibles here let's read a
[1:23:00] few scriptures
[1:23:01] at the beginning of the trial job was so
[1:23:04] strong
[1:23:05] he said the lord gives and the lord
[1:23:07] takes away but this trial was a fire he
[1:23:10] had to walk through
[1:23:12] and fire reveals what you're made of
[1:23:16] tests and trials are going to show
[1:23:19] what's left in your human spirit
[1:23:22] praise god we don't like talking about
[1:23:25] that
[1:23:26] but when we go through tests it really
[1:23:27] shows what we're made of
[1:23:30] the bible says got to be purified seven
[1:23:32] times
[1:23:34] the seven attributes of the statue of
[1:23:35] river man amen
[1:23:37] praise god look at job 9 17. let's go
[1:23:40] there
[1:23:44] i've been going 40 minutes so thank you
[1:23:46] for your patience job
[1:23:48] 9 17.
[1:23:53] look at jobs look at some of job's words
[1:23:56] after the initial part of the trial
[1:23:59] we start seeing some of his humanity
[1:24:06] well now before that yeah let's go to 9
[1:24:08] 17.
[1:24:12] for he breaketh me with a tempest and
[1:24:14] multiplies my wounds
[1:24:16] without cause this is one of job's worst
[1:24:19] mistakes that he said he said god is
[1:24:23] breaking me
[1:24:24] and multiplying my wounds and i didn't
[1:24:27] do anything wrong
[1:24:30] elahu rips him apart with this later on
[1:24:34] he said you have justified yourself more
[1:24:37] than god
[1:24:38] brother brahm just told us his fear that
[1:24:40] he had in his heart
[1:24:42] is what brought this trial up upon him
[1:24:46] praise god amen this is one of the worst
[1:24:49] things job could have ever said
[1:24:50] oh i don't deserve this trial listen
[1:24:52] church every spanking we get we deserve
[1:24:54] it
[1:24:56] praise god and every one we got we
[1:25:00] should say thank the lord
[1:25:02] hallelujah glory
[1:25:05] the bible said god does not tempt any
[1:25:08] man
[1:25:10] he allows us to go into it but he can't
[1:25:12] allow us to go into it unless there's a
[1:25:13] purpose
[1:25:14] most times it's because of our own sin
[1:25:17] in job's cases it was fear go to job
[1:25:19] three i believe it's 25 here
[1:25:21] job three i want to follow up on that
[1:25:22] brother-in-law quote
[1:25:25] yes job 3 25 read that with me
[1:25:28] let's read it out loud you got it let's
[1:25:30] read out loud on three one two three
[1:25:32] for the thing which i greatly feared is
[1:25:35] come upon me
[1:25:36] and that which i was afraid of is come
[1:25:39] unto me
[1:25:41] brother branham picks this up and he
[1:25:42] said job brought this
[1:25:44] upon himself but we're always told he's
[1:25:46] perfect he's perfect he was by the blood
[1:25:49] he was perfect in heaven but he wasn't
[1:25:51] perfect in earth
[1:25:53] so church he would make all those
[1:25:54] sacrifices for his children right he'd
[1:25:56] go
[1:25:56] in case anything happens he'd burn a
[1:25:57] sacrifice he'd pray but all the time in
[1:26:00] his heart fear was building up
[1:26:02] and the bible didn't say it was a little
[1:26:04] fear it was a great fear
[1:26:08] i greatly fear so job had an outward
[1:26:11] appearance as a
[1:26:12] man of god he'd help out people but
[1:26:14] there was times when he just battled
[1:26:16] fear oh i'm so afraid it's going to
[1:26:17] happen
[1:26:18] i don't want to lose what i got what if
[1:26:20] i lost everything i got
[1:26:22] church perfect love will cast out off
[1:26:24] here
[1:26:25] i've always prayed this i didn't even
[1:26:27] know before i preaches i always say lord
[1:26:28] give me faith like job
[1:26:30] that if the lord gives or the lord takes
[1:26:33] away i'll still say blessed be the name
[1:26:34] of the lord
[1:26:36] i don't want to be a slave to fear like
[1:26:38] that song says i'm no longer a slave to
[1:26:40] fear
[1:26:41] i'm a child of god but job became a
[1:26:45] slave to fear
[1:26:49] and so satan picked that up and god
[1:26:52] allowed this to happen
[1:26:53] but the whole time god knew my son he's
[1:26:55] going to overcome
[1:26:57] because he's got foreknowledge he know
[1:27:00] where he knows we're going to stumble he
[1:27:01] knows but he's got confidence
[1:27:03] we're going to endure the storm aren't
[1:27:06] you glad you're
[1:27:08] that god has confidence he knows the
[1:27:09] beginning from the end
[1:27:11] any trial he gives allows in your life
[1:27:13] it will never be too difficult to
[1:27:15] overcome
[1:27:15] and there's always going to be a way out
[1:27:17] where you don't have to sin
[1:27:19] but you can humble yourself and obey the
[1:27:21] word of god
[1:27:22] and get victory in the midst of the
[1:27:24] trial
[1:27:26] you do not have to fall to sin we looked
[1:27:28] at that remember king abimelech he took
[1:27:30] sarah
[1:27:31] and he's getting brothers that he's put
[1:27:32] on his pajamas at night and the lord
[1:27:34] said
[1:27:35] you're as good as a dead man. he said
[1:27:37] lord i didn't know she was married i
[1:27:39] didn't know she was married
[1:27:40] he said i know that's the reason i kept
[1:27:42] you from sinning against me
[1:27:44] if god will keep a heathen king from
[1:27:46] sinning against us
[1:27:48] but against him what about the queen of
[1:27:49] heaven amen what about the bride of
[1:27:51] jesus christ
[1:27:53] we're not heathens we're christians
[1:27:54] praise god
[1:27:56] but see integrity integrity
[1:28:00] honesty i don't want to sin against god
[1:28:03] and god looked at job and said that's
[1:28:05] what he's got
[1:28:06] but brother keith sometimes he just had
[1:28:08] my battles i'm going to lose my family
[1:28:10] i'm going to lose
[1:28:11] and satan took that and brought it
[1:28:14] before god and god said do whatever you
[1:28:16] want
[1:28:17] just don't take his life
[1:28:22] that's true whatever there's power of
[1:28:23] life and death in the tongue we looked
[1:28:24] at this morning right
[1:28:26] if we keep saying oh i'm worried about
[1:28:27] this i'm worried about that well guess
[1:28:29] what's going to happen
[1:28:31] speak the word hallelujah speak life
[1:28:35] speak good things right speak health be
[1:28:39] big victory praise god speak blessings
[1:28:44] don't let these things come out of our
[1:28:45] lives but as job goes through these
[1:28:46] months of trial
[1:28:48] we these fires expose more of his
[1:28:51] material what's in his human mind
[1:28:54] when it seems like god don't answer
[1:28:56] church when it seems like god don't
[1:28:58] answer sometimes we'll say the most
[1:28:59] embarrassing things
[1:29:03] the most ungodly things the most crazy
[1:29:05] things will come out of our mouths
[1:29:07] i don't deserve this i've known
[1:29:10] this this test has no cause
[1:29:14] yet it did everything has a cause
[1:29:18] it's all reaping and sowing is everybody
[1:29:20] with me today
[1:29:22] it's all everything in life is a reaping
[1:29:24] and a sowing
[1:29:28] and job said the thing that i greatly
[1:29:30] feared is come upon me
[1:29:34] may god help us not to fear praise god
[1:29:39] now for time's sake i got 15 more
[1:29:41] minutes there'll be an hour i'm not
[1:29:42] gonna preach hour and a half tonight by
[1:29:43] god's grace
[1:29:45] job says many harsh things job even
[1:29:48] demands i talk to god he demands god to
[1:29:50] come down and talk to him
[1:29:53] but ram said it was it was a sinful
[1:29:54] thing to demand god to heal
[1:29:56] to heal somebody remember that yet job
[1:30:00] demanded god come tell me
[1:30:02] what what what did i do wrong
[1:30:08] but all of a sudden god sends after
[1:30:11] after all these months of these three
[1:30:13] friends in job arguing who's righteous
[1:30:15] and who's not
[1:30:16] god sends a daysman brother brahm said
[1:30:21] god sent a young man down by the name of
[1:30:23] elihu
[1:30:24] come down to meet job a perfect type of
[1:30:27] christ
[1:30:28] again elahu means he is my god
[1:30:33] so job was crying out job was praying he
[1:30:35] said
[1:30:36] god is not a man as i am that i should
[1:30:38] answer him we should come together in
[1:30:40] judgment
[1:30:41] neither is there any days when betwixt
[1:30:42] us that he might lay his hand upon us
[1:30:44] both so job's crying out i need a
[1:30:46] mediator i need a
[1:30:47] mediator and god sent him one amen
[1:30:51] church
[1:30:51] if you need a mediator if you need a
[1:30:54] high priest
[1:30:55] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:30:56] your infirmities god has provided you
[1:30:59] one amen
[1:31:00] he'll send you one his name is jesus
[1:31:02] amen
[1:31:04] elijah is a perfect type of jesus christ
[1:31:11] oh my church it's beautiful
[1:31:17] job 32 verse 1 says
[1:31:20] job was righteous in his own eyes and
[1:31:23] then the bible said in
[1:31:24] 32 verse 2 the wrath of elijah was
[1:31:27] kindled against job look at this
[1:31:29] can you put that up there because he
[1:31:31] justified himself
[1:31:32] rather than god in some ways in the
[1:31:34] midst of the trial job was saying
[1:31:36] i'm more righteous than god
[1:31:39] that's why when i read it to you when
[1:31:41] god talks to satan
[1:31:43] when god talks to satan he says job is
[1:31:44] perfect but when god comes down to job
[1:31:46] he said who is this
[1:31:48] that darkeneth counsel against the
[1:31:50] almighty
[1:31:53] hello
[1:31:56] so you're perfect in heaven but you are
[1:31:59] many many faulty on earth and the church
[1:32:02] said
[1:32:04] god talks to the devil about you she's
[1:32:06] perfect
[1:32:08] he's he's a perfect man of god he hates
[1:32:10] evil but when god comes to correct you
[1:32:13] who are you who are you
[1:32:17] who do you think you are job to talk
[1:32:20] about me like that
[1:32:24] doesn't sound like a babying type of
[1:32:26] situation does it
[1:32:27] he wasn't babied by god was he
[1:32:31] no as a father corrects his son so does
[1:32:34] the lord pideth and correct his children
[1:32:39] this is some of the most beautiful
[1:32:41] revelations god showed me in the last
[1:32:43] few years
[1:32:49] job is a type uh if you've got your
[1:32:52] bible here let's go to uh
[1:32:54] go to job 16 12. i want to prove this to
[1:32:56] you job is a type of laodicea
[1:33:02] go to job uh 16 verse 2. can you put
[1:33:07] that up there brother when you get a
[1:33:07] chance
[1:33:09] thank you are you doing that brother
[1:33:10] troy thank you sir oh yeah sister thank
[1:33:12] you sister
[1:33:13] i love that look husband and wife
[1:33:15] working together
[1:33:17] my wife don't do anything like that so
[1:33:18] don't worry about that you know she
[1:33:20] she's gotta hold the baby the whole time
[1:33:22] look at this i'm sorry it was uh
[1:33:27] 16 12. i'm sorry my fault now look
[1:33:30] here's job confessing
[1:33:33] look what he says i was at ease but he
[1:33:35] had broken me asunder he had
[1:33:37] also taken me by his neck and shaking me
[1:33:39] to pieces and set me up for his mark
[1:33:40] keep that up there
[1:33:41] what was job doing at ease what did they
[1:33:45] say in the military at ease
[1:33:47] relax i do taekwondo they say at ease
[1:33:50] just relax if i gotta do something else
[1:33:53] i'm gonna
[1:33:53] waste my life i don't want cancer i
[1:33:56] don't want diabetes i gotta do something
[1:33:58] to work hard
[1:34:01] so job is a perfect type of laodicea
[1:34:04] he was rich increased with goods
[1:34:09] had need of nothing and he even says it
[1:34:13] spiritually
[1:34:14] i was at ease spiritually so when this
[1:34:16] trial came he was in a bondage to fear
[1:34:19] and he wasn't as diligent as he could be
[1:34:22] spiritually and the church said
[1:34:27] now the thing i love about the laodicean
[1:34:30] description
[1:34:31] he said i counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:34:33] tried in the fire
[1:34:35] pulled up job 23 10 brother or sister
[1:34:37] sorry
[1:34:38] get them all mixed up so jesus tells
[1:34:42] laodicea
[1:34:42] come to me i'll give you gold tried in
[1:34:44] the fire what does job say
[1:34:47] he says but he knoweth the way that i
[1:34:50] take when he hath tried me
[1:34:52] i shall come forth as gold
[1:34:55] and this is after he had seen my
[1:34:57] redeemer that was chapter 19.
[1:34:59] i know my redeemer liveth and i'll stand
[1:35:02] with him
[1:35:02] on the earth at the last day praise god
[1:35:06] so what was in the midst of his trial
[1:35:08] sometimes he was up sometimes he was
[1:35:10] down
[1:35:10] sometimes he had revelations sometimes
[1:35:12] he had trials
[1:35:14] sometimes he said good things sometimes
[1:35:16] he say bad things sounds a lot like us
[1:35:20] go to job 42 5. the bible said
[1:35:24] and jesus said anoint thine eyes without
[1:35:26] i salve
[1:35:27] that thou mayest see
[1:35:31] does that apply to laodicea job said i
[1:35:34] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:35:36] ear
[1:35:37] but now my eyes
[1:35:42] this is amazing amen job is a perfect
[1:35:45] type of you and i
[1:35:46] going through laodicea
[1:35:50] rich and increase with goods have needed
[1:35:52] nothing but you've got to be
[1:35:54] gold we've got to go through the fires
[1:35:56] and have gold brother
[1:35:57] said it's christ-like character
[1:36:01] patience tried and tested by fire
[1:36:04] praise god an eye self that you can see
[1:36:07] seeing is always understanding in the
[1:36:09] bible seeing as always you understand
[1:36:12] well now i know what this means
[1:36:13] now i know why this happens sight is
[1:36:15] always understanding you know what you
[1:36:17] see
[1:36:19] so job is the perfect type of you and i
[1:36:23] as many as i love i rebuke and chase him
[1:36:26] god chastens this man
[1:36:30] go to job let's go i think it's 40 go to
[1:36:33] joe 40 i think it's
[1:36:36] 40.
[1:36:38] now we saw job 38 right
[1:36:51] yeah go to job 40 here
[1:36:57] yeah we read job 38
[1:37:02] god rebukes job in job 38 1-3
[1:37:06] he says who is this
[1:37:10] can you imagine can i just dramatize
[1:37:11] this real quick for all those days job
[1:37:14] and his three friends just start
[1:37:15] sat arguing one would step up and say
[1:37:17] you're this that
[1:37:18] they'd finally sit down ah yeah i really
[1:37:20] gave it to job job would stand up and
[1:37:22] say
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:25] i really gave it to them and the next
[1:37:26] one would stand up
[1:37:29] and after all their blabbering
[1:37:34] some clouds started coming off in the
[1:37:36] horizon
[1:37:38] job had said earlier i demand to talk to
[1:37:41] god
[1:37:42] i've done nothing wrong and yet he said
[1:37:45] all these things pretty soon the storm
[1:37:48] starts coming in
[1:37:51] then you hear the wind blowing
[1:37:54] pretty soon the wind all gets into one
[1:37:56] spot as a whirlwind
[1:37:59] and a whirlwind starts forming by job
[1:38:01] and his three friends and allah who's
[1:38:02] standing right there the whole time too
[1:38:04] you know he's like and all of a sudden
[1:38:06] now the world when god speaks and says
[1:38:08] who is this that darkeneth counsel
[1:38:10] he said gird you up your loins like a
[1:38:12] man in other words when you grind up
[1:38:13] your loins you're ready to work
[1:38:15] in other words joe come on show me what
[1:38:16] you're going to do show me how powerful
[1:38:18] you are
[1:38:19] gird up your loins show me what kind of
[1:38:20] man you are
[1:38:24] and god takes job on a virtual tour of
[1:38:27] the entire universe
[1:38:31] he starts by zooming out and saying did
[1:38:33] you lay the foundations of the earth
[1:38:35] tell me what are the pillars of the
[1:38:38] earth can you tell me how they hang
[1:38:39] there then he goes to the scene he says
[1:38:43] can you tell me how deep the sea is
[1:38:47] remember job said let me talk to god and
[1:38:49] god didn't ever answer this question
[1:38:51] god asked him questions
[1:38:56] he takes them up to the mountains
[1:38:57] brother keith and said do you know when
[1:38:59] the goats bring forth their babies do
[1:39:00] you make sure they got enough
[1:39:02] milk
[1:39:05] he said can you loose the bands of the
[1:39:07] stars of orion
[1:39:08] can you kind of change where the
[1:39:09] constellations are
[1:39:12] he said where is uh darkness is home

[1:39:18] where the snowflakes and the hail are
[1:39:22] stored up in their treasure houses can
[1:39:23] you tell me that
[1:39:28] he asked him over 60 questions
[1:39:32] he goes through all the universe and
[1:39:34] then he ends with these last two
[1:39:36] two animals dinosaurs
[1:39:40] he shows him the brachiosaurus and said
[1:39:42] can you handle this brachiosaurus
[1:39:44] his tail is like a cedar tree
[1:39:48] then he takes him to the sea and says
[1:39:49] can you handle this leviathan
[1:39:51] this plesiosaurus that breathes fire
[1:39:54] can you handle this he said you can't
[1:39:56] even tame the beast
[1:39:57] and i made the beasts hallelujah
[1:40:01] in other words we must not talk against
[1:40:03] the almighty god amen
[1:40:06] we must not accuse him of anything wrong
[1:40:09] because he does everything right amen
[1:40:11] we're the ones that make mistakes we're
[1:40:13] the ones that are guilty
[1:40:15] but he's made a way that we can have
[1:40:17] fellowship through the blood amen

[1:40:57] am clean without
[1:40:58] job said i'm clean without transgression
[1:41:00] i'm innocent neither is there iniquity
[1:41:02] in me in other words
[1:41:04] a lie who's saying you committed
[1:41:06] iniquity

[1:41:09] from all this he said you had fear
[1:41:12] you had iniquity in you you know what to

[1:41:21] 33 12.
[1:41:25] behold in this thou art not just i will
[1:41:27] answer that god is greater than man
[1:41:30] so job is saying i'm just i'm fair i'm
[1:41:33] righteous
[1:41:34] and elijah's saying you know you're not
[1:41:36] you're more
[1:41:37] he said you were saying you're more just
[1:41:38] than god go to verse 17 sister this
[1:41:40] lightning round you're doing a good job
[1:41:42] so far
[1:41:43] he that he may withdraw a man from his
[1:41:46] purpose
[1:41:46] and hide pride from man
[1:41:50] so joe elijah's saying you've got pride
[1:41:53] pride has built up in your life pride
[1:41:56] iniquity
[1:41:58] fear but yet in heaven god said he's my
[1:42:01] perfect boy

[1:42:13] then we're going to give our sister
[1:42:14] round of applause for her lightning
[1:42:15] round here
[1:42:17] 34 37 the last one job
[1:42:21] the last clear sin is he rebelled
[1:42:24] against god
[1:42:28] for he added rebellion unto his sin
[1:42:31] he clappeth his hands among us and
[1:42:33] multiplies his words
[1:42:35] against god go back and read job if you
[1:42:39] haven't look at some of his statements
[1:42:41] he said where's god i need to talk to
[1:42:43] god i demand god come talk to me i did
[1:42:45] nothing wrong
[1:42:47] that's proof you did do something wrong
[1:42:49] you're talking like that
[1:42:52] so out of all job's good when the trials
[1:42:55] came
[1:42:56] he had a lot of bad too fear
[1:42:59] iniquity pride laziness
[1:43:03] rebellion
[1:43:07] i hope this is helping somebody
[1:43:13] elijah says job was drinking up scorn
[1:43:17] we don't have time to go through this he
[1:43:18] was in other words he was drinking up
[1:43:20] mocking against god he was scorning
[1:43:22] against god just
[1:43:22] just dissatisfied with god's treatment
[1:43:25] of him
[1:43:26] he drank it up like a cup it's in job 34
[1:43:29] verses 3 through 9.
[1:43:33] elijah says elijah justifies god
[1:43:37] and eli who says if god would personally
[1:43:39] reply to you job
[1:43:40] men would turn to dust is what elijah
[1:43:43] said
[1:43:46] and then elijah who says job is
[1:43:48] condemning god the most just one
[1:43:49] and i'm putting these on here for people
[1:43:50] that watch it go look it up in your
[1:43:52] bible in church we need to do more of
[1:43:53] that we need to go look up these in the
[1:43:54] bible
[1:43:55] don't take my word for it you go study
[1:43:56] the word of god romans said when you get
[1:43:58] those tapes
[1:43:59] go study in the quietness of your room
[1:44:01] and see he said see what god will reveal
[1:44:03] to you
[1:44:04] that's the trouble people just want the
[1:44:05] preachers to study for themselves
[1:44:07] preachers need to study but you need to
[1:44:08] study too
[1:44:10] if not you're going to go study
[1:44:12] something else and the church said
[1:44:14] if you don't study god's word you're
[1:44:17] going to study something else
[1:44:19] i've seen friends do that they were so
[1:44:20] close to god in our church but they
[1:44:22] started studying business more in the
[1:44:23] word of god
[1:44:24] and their lives have just fallen away
[1:44:25] from the word they'll let
[1:44:27] makeup in all kinds of things evil video
[1:44:30] games
[1:44:31] before they would have never thought of
[1:44:32] that but because they stop studying
[1:44:34] god's word
[1:44:35] their minds go study other things and
[1:44:38] they're not strong enough
[1:44:39] to fight off temptation anymore right
[1:44:42] there's my hour so i'm going to set a
[1:44:44] timer for
[1:44:44] hopefully i can finish in 10 minutes i
[1:44:47] like to keep track of my preaching i
[1:44:48] don't want to wear you guys
[1:45:02] hallelujah so in other words
[1:45:06] god comes in a world when he basically
[1:45:08] says job
[1:45:09] who are you you're an ignorant man
[1:45:13] because he just asked him 60 questions
[1:45:16] and he couldn't answer
[1:45:17] one of them what does god want us to be
[1:45:22] humble are you with me
[1:45:28] we don't know at all praise god
[1:45:36] can you tell me any of these 60
[1:45:38] questions
[1:45:40] job said no i can't tell you anything
[1:45:42] let's read what he said
[1:45:44] i think i had you in job 40 right
[1:45:49] yeah job 40. look at joe 40.
[1:45:53] look at verse 3 then job answer lauren
[1:45:54] said behold i am
[1:45:56] vile look at that saints we ought to
[1:45:59] rejoice
[1:45:59] he's perfect in heaven but he realizes
[1:46:01] he's still vile on earth
[1:46:04] but the man said we walk through this
[1:46:05] world and we got to keep our skirts
[1:46:07] clean
[1:46:08] sometimes we get vile when we get in the
[1:46:11] flesh
[1:46:13] god said he's perfect but down here
[1:46:14] after god talks to job he said i'm so
[1:46:16] vile just like peter right
[1:46:20] jesus said casternet on the other side
[1:46:21] he's like fine we we did it all night go
[1:46:24] ahead
[1:46:24] they pull the net and there's so many
[1:46:26] fishes they can't handle it he falls out
[1:46:28] and said lord depart from me i'm a
[1:46:29] sinful man
[1:46:30] that's what we all are praise god we're
[1:46:32] all sinful men we all need a savior amen
[1:46:38] what shall i answer thee i will lay my
[1:46:40] hand upon my mouth
[1:46:42] what's my answer here's my answer god
[1:46:47] i can't answer any of those questions
[1:46:50] once i've spoken verse 5 but i will not
[1:46:52] answer yey twice but i will proceed no
[1:46:54] further
[1:46:54] then the lord answered joe by the world
[1:46:56] and said girl thy loins like a man
[1:46:58] i'll demand of thee and thou declare
[1:47:00] unto me
[1:47:01] look at this church god wasn't babying
[1:47:03] him around like a little baby
[1:47:06] god would say no you asked and demanded
[1:47:08] i come down
[1:47:09] here i am now i'm demanding of you tell
[1:47:12] me
[1:47:15] god don't play around the holy ghost is
[1:47:16] the holy spirit not an unholy spirit
[1:47:22] be careful what we create with our words
[1:47:24] we must be very careful what we create
[1:47:28] look at he says in verse 8 will thou
[1:47:31] distance my judgment
[1:47:33] see job had disannulled god's judgment
[1:47:35] said god judged wrong
[1:47:36] god's treating me wrong god never treats
[1:47:38] anybody wrong
[1:47:41] i'll say it again god never treats
[1:47:43] anybody wrong
[1:47:45] will thou condemn me that thou mayest be
[1:47:48] righteous what was job doing he was
[1:47:49] condemning god
[1:47:52] job was condemning god for letting these
[1:47:55] trials happen
[1:47:56] but god said it's you're just passing
[1:47:58] through a fire you need to pass through
[1:48:00] the fire
[1:48:00] to get rid of all your jaws amen how did
[1:48:04] this that you can come forth
[1:48:05] as gold amen i want gold
[1:48:08] character i want christ like character
[1:48:11] you have to go through fires
[1:48:12] god judges everything right god is holy
[1:48:15] everything he does is right whatever
[1:48:17] happens in your life is good
[1:48:19] thank god for it amen
[1:48:24] you're going to condemn me god said let
[1:48:27] me ask you some more questions
[1:48:28] that's what he did you want to ask him
[1:48:30] more of those 60-some questions
[1:48:34] go to job 42
[1:48:40] verse 1 then job answer the lord said i
[1:48:42] know that thou canst do everything
[1:48:44] that no thought can be withholding from
[1:48:45] thee who is he that hideth counsel
[1:48:47] without knowledge
[1:48:48] therefore have i uttered that i
[1:48:50] understood not look job
[1:48:51] in the prince of the holy ghost the
[1:48:54] prince of that whirlwind brother keith
[1:48:55] that holy spirit
[1:48:57] he finally gets honest and he recognizes
[1:49:00] reality
[1:49:01] i have said things i didn't understand i
[1:49:04] judge myself righteous
[1:49:06] and i accuse god of i condemn god
[1:49:09] notice church he never cursed god
[1:49:13] he just condemned god by saying his
[1:49:16] judgment wasn't right
[1:49:18] and the whole time brother elijah god's
[1:49:20] saying he's perfect in heaven
[1:49:23] you have a sacrifice to cover your sins
[1:49:27] devil he's perfect but when he deals
[1:49:30] with his son down on the earth he said
[1:49:31] you've got a lot of
[1:49:32] problems you really need to be burned up
[1:49:36] you really need to be cleansed
[1:49:41] hallelujah the bible calls it a
[1:49:44] refiner's fire
[1:49:48] brother jesse i made lots of mistakes
[1:49:49] that's fine he's just refining you
[1:49:53] praise god you're going to be better
[1:49:55] after this trial gets over
[1:49:57] after you confess your sins you'll be a
[1:49:59] much better christian
[1:50:00] because you're going through my fire but
[1:50:03] you've said some things
[1:50:05] you should not have said
[1:50:09] and see the holy spirit will show how
[1:50:11] vile we are how many can say amen to
[1:50:12] that
[1:50:13] anybody anybody seen their vile nature
[1:50:15] their sin nature lately
[1:50:19] i have utter things too wonderful for me
[1:50:21] in verse three which i knew not here i
[1:50:23] beseech thee and i will speak i will
[1:50:25] demand of thee and declare
[1:50:26] thou unto me i have heard thee by the
[1:50:28] hearing of thy ear but now my eye seeth
[1:50:30] wherefore i abhor myself and repent in
[1:50:33] dust
[1:50:33] and ashes
[1:50:38] now you know he's he's the example too
[1:50:40] he's the example of his
[1:50:42] the last part of his life was the best
[1:50:44] part of his life
[1:50:47] because god bless his children god bless
[1:50:49] his finances the bible said god gave him
[1:50:51] double
[1:50:53] so church we can expect hopefully by
[1:50:54] god's grace double blessings amen
[1:50:57] double peace double joy double mercy

[1:51:53] holy ghost until the holy ghost comes to
[1:51:55] live there himself
[1:51:57] you've heard of the patience of job as
[1:51:59] before the holy ghost could come
[1:52:01] so job what helped him get through his
[1:52:02] trials patience
[1:52:05] you've heard of the patience of job
[1:52:09] and have seen the end of the lord that
[1:52:12] the lord is very pitiful
[1:52:14] and of tender mercies can you imagine
[1:52:18] god forgave job of job condemning god
[1:52:22] what if somebody condemned you would you
[1:52:23] be quick to forgive them and then reward
[1:52:25] them a whole bunch after that
[1:52:28] church god has divine love he is divine
[1:52:31] love amen
[1:52:32] god is love amen and god is very pitiful
[1:52:36] he's very merciful
[1:52:44] we count them happy which endure so let
[1:52:47] me tell you this if you're going through
[1:52:48] a test of faith i don't care how long
[1:52:50] it's been months years
[1:52:51] decades i don't care let me just
[1:52:53] encourage you with this endure it
[1:52:58] confess your sins right
[1:53:01] confess any sin that's what job had to
[1:53:04] do
[1:53:04] i repent i abhor myself in dust and
[1:53:08] ashes
[1:53:09] let's stand to our feet
[1:53:12] here's what trials do as you're standing
[1:53:13] i'm just going to go the musicians could
[1:53:15] come
[1:53:16] brother branham said look at job a
[1:53:18] perfect man this is in questions
[1:53:19] answered on the holy ghost 59
[1:53:21] and god permitted the evil devil to come
[1:53:23] upon him and chastise him and everything
[1:53:25] else for the perfecting of his spirit
[1:53:29] these trials were just making perfect
[1:53:32] but yet god already said he was perfect
[1:53:34] well yeah part of him was perfect but
[1:53:36] part of him wasn't
[1:53:38] his human spirit his mind his thoughts
[1:53:41] wasn't perfect
[1:53:42] so the trials came to make him perfect
[1:53:46] there's four reasons god allows us to
[1:53:47] suffer
[1:53:49] self-judgment and humility that's what
[1:53:52] job said i repent
[1:53:53] i abhor myself
[1:53:56] the second reason god gives you trials
[1:53:58] is so you'll obey the word next time
[1:54:02] the third reason so you can be more
[1:54:04] fruitful after the trial is over
[1:54:09] and the last reason you can be a
[1:54:11] testimony to others
[1:54:13] that you went through the trial and just
[1:54:15] like job if you endure
[1:54:17] you'll come out as gold on the other
[1:54:19] side
[1:54:21] and the church said let's bow our heads
[1:54:23] here
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:27] heavenly father we're grateful lord for
[1:54:30] your word
[1:54:32] lord i want to just thank you personally
[1:54:33] this message has helped me so much lord
[1:54:35] god

[1:54:37] my own mistakes job's mistakes
[1:54:40] all of our mistakes we've all fallen
[1:54:42] short of the glory of god
[1:54:44] and roman said in every mouth is an open
[1:54:47] sepulchre
[1:54:48] every mouth can be a grave of dead men's
[1:54:51] thoughts and bones
[1:54:53] oh god and the tongue
[1:54:57] is untameable by man but it's tameable

[1:55:08] being in your house dear god

[1:55:15] forgive them lord god and may they
[1:55:17] repent and come closer to you and put a
[1:55:19] special blessing on these that have come

[1:55:27] that they're going to be more perfect
[1:55:28] they're going to be more obedient
[1:55:29] they're going to be more fruitful
[1:55:31] after they get through the trial and
[1:55:34] lord let their words please you
[1:55:36] may they not speak anything against you
[1:55:38] forgive them if they do lord god
