[17:55] before we go any further we have a
[17:58] little prayer for brother rich father
[18:00] God we come
[18:06] so that you would help him through
[18:08] whatever he's going through I pray
[18:11] father God that you will just bless him
[18:12] Lord strengthen him Lord and reveal to
[18:16] him whatever he needs to be that needs
[18:19] to be revealed to him Lord in your
[18:21] lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[18:24] you love the Lord
[18:29] we had three birthdays today didn't know
[18:32] it I was wondering why he was waiting to
[18:35] wear that suit of his a Keith birthday
[18:41] and the twin boys and the twin boys
[18:46] today their birthdays yeah and now we
[18:54] know he's good at keeping secrets
[18:58] so no reason why he told me today I
[19:01] think because they had already planned
[19:03] to take him somewhere and today not
[19:05] realizing they were gonna take him
[19:08] somewhere I was gonna ask him to take
[19:10] him out to dinner today and that's when
[19:12] I found out it was his birthday so God
[19:15] is good to us amen let us turn by the
[19:20] Word of God we try not to be long we
[19:22] have communion tonight I appreciate
[19:24] everybody who's here I'm gonna go to
[19:28] Deuteronomy just gonna read the 19th
[19:30] verse of that particular chapter
[19:33] Deuteronomy 26 19 and then I think we're
[19:39] going to go to Deuteronomy 12 26
[19:45] Deuteronomy 26:19
[19:51] God is good to us
[20:13] enteries and to make the high above all
[20:17] nations which he have made and made in
[20:22] praise and in name and in honor and thou
[20:26] may it be the holy people unto the Lord
[20:29] thy God as he hath spoken now we turn to
[20:34] Deuteronomy 12 26
[20:44] it's amazing how God in the scripture
[20:49] has about three to four maybe five texts
[20:55] on this kind of calling the people of
[20:59] God a holy priesthood a holy nation and
[21:03] we're gonna read the 12 26 it says only
[21:08] your holy things which you have to offer
[21:12] and what you have vowed you shall take
[21:16] and go to the place before the sanctuary
[21:19] which the Lord shall choose only your
[21:24] holy things let's let's read one more
[21:27] scripture 14 and to Deuteronomy same
[21:38] for you are a holy people set apart to
[21:42] the Lord your God and the Lord has
[21:46] chosen you to be a peculiar people to
[21:48] himself above all the nations on the
[21:52] earth now I read it in the regular and
[21:59] verb
[22:02] King James verse 4 thou art a holy
[22:05] people unto the Lord thy God and the
[22:09] Lord have chosen thee to be a peculiar
[22:11] people unto himself of all the nations
[22:16] that upon the earth hallelujah father we
[22:22] come before you we thank you for your
[22:24] grace we thank you for your mercy and
[22:27] all that you have done for us and all
[22:31] that you are doing for us father I pray
[22:34] that you would bless the service in a
[22:36] special way forgive us and cleanse us
[22:39] from all unrighteousness Lord
[22:41] we'd be careful to give you the praise
[22:43] glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name
[22:46] we pray amen
[22:47] you may be seated
[22:55] Larrin said it won't be long because of
[22:58] communion by God's grace but as we
[23:01] started this morning we were telling you
[23:04] or speaking to you about the message of
[23:07] freedom and really it is a message of
[23:10] freedom and our freedom was gained for
[23:14] us before the foundation of the world
[23:18] it's not something that it just happened
[23:23] but we have a choice in this freedom a
[23:28] choice to continue to go forward or a
[23:33] choice to - to remain under bondage I
[23:39] know I felt like I was leaving something
[23:42] but anyway we realized there was a law
[23:47] in the scripture and that law in the
[23:52] scripture tells us that we we have a
[23:59] choice and even though we are born in
[24:04] sin shaped and iniquities come out speak
[24:08] in lies we still have a choice to go
[24:13] free or to stay with the taskmaster
[24:17] according to Exodus 21 beginning at the
[24:21] first verse says now these are the
[24:25] judgments without shall set before them
[24:28] if thou by a Hebrew servant 6 years he
[24:34] shall serve and in the seventh he shall
[24:37] go out free for nothing if he came in by
[24:41] himself he shall go out by himself
[24:45] and if he were married and then his wife
[24:48] shall go out with him if his master have
[24:52] given him a wife and she had borne him
[24:55] sons or daughters the wife and her
[24:58] children shall be her masters and he
[25:02] shall go out himself and if the servants
[25:06] shall plainly say I love my master
[25:08] my wife my children I will no God not go
[25:13] out free then this master shall bring
[25:16] him forth unto the judges he should also
[25:20] bring him to the door or unto the
[25:23] doorpost understand this door is Christ
[25:27] Jesus Christ I am the way in his
[25:31] mastership bore his ear through within
[25:34] all and he shall serve Him whatever so
[25:39] it shows that even in the Jewish laws
[25:41] the laws were set there because there
[25:45] are times people God in difficult times
[25:47] and sometimes they were being who would
[25:51] sell their daughters to slavery a
[25:54] servant to be a servant but they had
[25:57] what they call in the law the year of
[26:00] Jubilee and of course we know that the
[26:04] year of Jubilee to the Jewish nation was
[26:09] every 400 said for sevens which would be
[26:14] four weeks or four and every every
[26:18] fiftieth year for let me put it this way
[26:19] - it took to simplify it but it always
[26:22] would be seven Sabbath's you know and
[26:26] what what we need to see by God's grace
[26:29] is that - to everybody sold into slavery
[26:36] every seventh year was a year of jubilee
[26:40] to them so they could get out because it
[26:43] may even though it may be a time when it
[26:46] may not have been for someone else but
[26:48] for those who have served their time
[26:50] when that jubilee trumpet was given or
[26:54] sounded they could go free
[26:56] now I said with every six years and on
[27:00] the seventh they could go free so you
[27:02] got to understand by God's grace amen
[27:05] God allowed that door to be open the
[27:09] only stipulation was that if the man
[27:13] came into this masters kingdom a house
[27:17] and he married a wife who was already a
[27:20] slave
[27:22] when that sound of that trumpet or when
[27:25] that year came that he could go free he
[27:27] could go free but the family the wife
[27:31] and the children belong to the master so
[27:34] it was almost an entrapment that's why
[27:37] you know even the prophet of God says
[27:40] you know under no circumstances do a
[27:43] believer marry an unbeliever
[27:45] there's always traps there's always
[27:47] snares and you know so that you
[27:52] understand he said then if the man
[27:54] chooses to stay with his wife and his
[27:59] family he can stay but when he stays
[28:04] amen it means that he has to be taken to
[28:08] the door right that that those words are
[28:12] not just a set therefore not the door is
[28:17] a way of entrance and the door is a way
[28:19] of exit and so we understand Amen that
[28:23] door represents Christ it this is a
[28:26] shadow this is a tight this has a
[28:29] spiritual meaning because everybody God
[28:33] gives a chance to experience the truth
[28:37] of Jesus Christ regardless to what
[28:40] denomination or organization they're in
[28:43] they will if they really thirst for
[28:46] Christ God will bring them to that place
[28:50] but you see that the truth of the matter
[28:52] is truth hurts
[28:55] truth is are hardly ever in the format
[29:00] in which you think it ought to be truth
[29:04] is wrong nothing about it is dressed up
[29:08] it's naked it is what it is
[29:11] and often time people say God I want
[29:14] more of you and when God comes on the
[29:18] scene they're not willing to make the
[29:20] sacrifice and and what do you mean
[29:23] brother books because God's way is
[29:26] straight and narrow remember the man who
[29:29] was born blind from birth thirty years
[29:33] he was blind
[29:35] but his parents was so knitted into that
[29:39] organization and the organization put
[29:43] out a decree if any man in this
[29:45] particular organization or this
[29:47] particular church is caught worshipping
[29:50] Jesus Christ or following him your name
[29:53] will be put off the book and you won't
[29:55] have nothing we won't have fellowship
[29:57] with you that was the threat so when
[30:01] they the Pharisees came to this man who
[30:04] was born blind and asked him who did
[30:08] give you sight they couldn't just say
[30:12] Jesus they say go ask my son he's of age
[30:18] he'll tell you you're in the story and
[30:22] the Pharisees came and they went to him
[30:25] the blind man and the blind man not even
[30:28] having a theological degree he said
[30:34] surely it must be in your writings that
[30:38] a man who doeth evil cannot heal yeah he
[30:42] said you can say whatever you want to
[30:44] say but let me say it like this
[30:46] I once was blind but now I see is it not
[30:52] true only that man or that person that
[30:54] come from God can do such a thing as
[30:57] this now he's preaching to the preacher
[30:59] and they got really angry at us ed him
[31:04] because here was this man trying to
[31:07] convert the Pharisees to believe on
[31:11] Jesus Christ guess what they did instead
[31:15] of embracing the truth from this man
[31:19] they kicked him out and in the message
[31:23] then came Jesus he said because every
[31:26] time you kicked out of a place for the
[31:29] name of Jesus Christ Jesus will always
[31:31] show up he'll take you in when nobody
[31:36] else will and surely this is a sign this
[31:40] is the thing that because their Jubilee
[31:42] came and Jesus even told them I am the
[31:47] door
[31:49] I am the way if you want to escape out
[31:52] of this slavery this bondage that you in
[31:55] I am the way and except you believe that
[31:58] I am he you should likewise die in your
[32:01] sins he told them but they refused
[32:07] because of fear they refused because of
[32:11] the pressure that the Pharisee Pharisees
[32:14] and the Sadducees was placing on the
[32:16] people they didn't want to be persecuted
[32:19] they didn't want to be criticized and no
[32:22] doubt in that time the churches probably
[32:25] had some services that they were giving
[32:27] out so they didn't want to be cut off
[32:29] from those things either you know
[32:32] churches do that right oh yeah you don't
[32:35] believe no service and so yes so all of
[32:39] those things were if you could bring it
[32:41] to modern term was in play it was in the
[32:44] place and so therefore they they did
[32:47] what they chose to stay with the
[32:50] Pharisees and the Sadducees but the
[32:52] blind man not only did he receive light
[32:55] la Cite but he received life why because
[33:00] he heard a way of entrance and a way of
[33:04] escape right
[33:06] amen he didn't even know who healed him
[33:09] because he was blind but when Jesus
[33:12] began to talk to him he says show me
[33:15] this man so you see you see even in our
[33:22] day and time we must be careful that the
[33:26] system or assist we don't develop a
[33:29] system where that God would drop ruel
[33:34] relation or something new that was we'd
[33:38] be able to receive it because we
[33:42] understand the prophet of God said there
[33:43] is coming something and I know a lot of
[33:48] people think well it's already here he
[33:49] said known just prior to them after
[33:51] their coming a short quick message he
[33:54] said it whatever I said well that we
[33:56] already in that but what if we're not
[33:59] what if the system has interpreted that
[34:01] way
[34:03] because you got to understand that God's
[34:05] interpreters are one word
[34:06] what about it when brother man's ready
[34:09] it'll be so simple
[34:10] it'll pass right through you if you're
[34:12] not careful you'll miss it because
[34:17] everybody's looking here when we need to
[34:20] be looking here face down from the earth
[34:26] from which we come from humility
[34:28] humbleness amen
[34:31] coming to a place where we're looking at
[34:33] Christ as that little publicans said
[34:35] smiting his breakfast as the Lord I'm
[34:38] not worthy I'm not working I'm only
[34:43] worthy because you made me worthy that's
[34:46] it I have nothing to bring I have
[34:48] nothing to offer there's nothing that I
[34:50] can give it ain't about me is about you
[34:53] and you understand we are accepted in
[34:55] Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus alone no
[34:59] church is accepted no organization
[35:01] accepted they missed them they missed
[35:03] the mark and ending everybody that
[35:06] trusted that we shall Methodist Beth I'm
[35:08] not just talking about them to our
[35:10] people who among this message that have
[35:12] formed a system thinking that the system
[35:15] is going to save them you are just as
[35:17] deceive as everybody else the truth
[35:22] about Jesus Christ is what saves you and
[35:24] that is Grace and it's something that
[35:27] God has to reveal to you Paul said I
[35:32] press toward the mark of a high calling
[35:34] which is in Christ Jesus so we
[35:37] understand this calling is not not
[35:40] something that you can just walk into it
[35:43] is a press and it is a high calling we
[35:47] have all the church ages have the
[35:49] highest of all calling we have been
[35:52] called amen to a body change a
[35:56] translation hallelujah a people that
[36:00] will not have to see the grave
[36:01] hallelujah we bypassed there that's the
[36:06] coaly
[36:08] that's the calling what a freedom that
[36:13] we have to that to know that there's no
[36:16] condemnation to those who walk not after
[36:19] the flesh but after the spirit no
[36:21] condemnation when that sin is not
[36:25] imputed to us and the Bible said blessed
[36:29] is the man who look who God will not
[36:32] impute sin is that right and brother
[36:35] Branham said that man is the bride
[36:37] the bride has no sin imputed now I'm
[36:42] talking about a Holy Ghost filled bride
[36:45] now I'm not talking about potential I'm
[36:47] talking about somebody who has meant
[36:50] God's criteria woo
[36:55] how are we going to do it just like
[36:59] Samson said I love that oh Lord
[37:03] once more coz Samson realized one thing
[37:08] and he was a type of the bride that we
[37:10] are not thing without his anointing you
[37:14] can't add one cubit to your statue like
[37:18] I said this morning except the Lord
[37:21] build the house the laborer Labor's in
[37:25] vain
[37:26] we need God to build his house
[37:29] hallelujah when you know see we must
[37:33] understand that God is requiring us to
[37:36] be free from the world
[37:38] God has always separated darkness from
[37:41] light night from darkness
[37:43] you know and we are called to be free he
[37:47] said according to this message he says
[37:49] it's when you know that you have the
[37:53] earnest of your eternal Redemption right
[37:56] now in you by the baptism of the Holy
[38:00] Spirit it's already quickened you you
[38:05] are now risen with him and we're sitting
[38:08] together in heavenly places in Christ
[38:10] Jesus that's what I'm talking about
[38:12] you know what heavenly places to us is
[38:14] it's the sixth dimension because we're
[38:19] born here in the third brother Branham
[38:22] said he saw our theophany in the sixth
[38:24] dimension yellow so we are quickened
[38:29] from
[38:30] here today in our spirit man y'all hear
[38:34] what I'm saying and that's why he said
[38:36] when you believe this message or receive
[38:38] this message you have heard from your
[38:42] theophany that means there's a part of
[38:45] you that's relaying messages to this
[38:48] part hallelujah and you must understand
[38:53] by God's grace that every time you go
[38:56] through something there's an angel
[38:58] ministering to you and he's the
[39:03] messenger
[39:04] he's the word and one-a-day dealt
[39:07] theophany and you were joined together
[39:09] and be one he's the strong man he's the
[39:14] perfect man hallelujah and he's the one
[39:18] that that by God's grace ministering and
[39:21] pulling us into the very statue of
[39:23] Christ whoo somebody help me here see
[39:29] quicken you you are now risen with him
[39:34] and we're setting together heavenly
[39:37] places in Christ Jesus you're no more of
[39:40] the world if you love the world and the
[39:43] affections are still on the things of
[39:46] the world then the love of God is not
[39:48] even in you see we are formed free from
[39:53] the world hmm we are from free from the
[39:59] world there is no more desire hallelujah
[40:06] now we're not working with the devil you
[40:09] know trying to put something in your
[40:11] mind or your spirit you can always fight
[40:13] this flesh forget it if you think you're
[40:16] gonna go scot free own it that's the
[40:18] only thing he can target
[40:19] he's our flesh because this that's the
[40:23] only thing that hasn't been converted
[40:24] yet right oh he knows what he's God he
[40:29] knows what he's working with hallelujah
[40:33] now listen what he says he says this in
[40:37] depth on adoption three if he's an
[40:41] archangel if he's a
[40:43] bishop if he's a general overseer if
[40:46] he's a doctor so-and-so whosoever he is
[40:50] if he doesn't preach the water baptism
[40:52] in the name of Jesus Christ the baptism
[40:56] of the holy ghost doesn't preach the
[40:58] restoration of the gifts the coming of
[41:01] Christ and all these things let him be
[41:04] accursed if he tries to take any of
[41:07] those things these words here and say it
[41:10] was for another day and place it over on
[41:13] some new fandangled idea that we learn
[41:17] off of sub seminary let him be accursed
[41:21] who that that's powerful
[41:26] absolutely as we say steps of holiness
[41:31] that's what people don't understand see
[41:33] people don't understand that that there
[41:36] is a true revelation of Jesus Christ and
[41:39] everything else is impersonations
[41:44] just like when Paul came he says I'm not
[41:49] going to preach another Jesus in other
[41:52] words there's another Jesus his name is
[41:55] Jesus but his character doesn't fit the
[41:57] word that's how we know that the Jesus
[42:00] that had been preached to us is the
[42:02] right one because the character of our
[42:06] Jesus is the same as the word see and we
[42:11] base that upon Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus
[42:15] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[42:18] forever and whatever God Christ required
[42:22] yesterday he's requiring it today and
[42:25] forever is that all right so you must
[42:29] understand what our steps must be steps
[42:33] of holiness
[42:34] it must be steps of righteousness and
[42:38] there is not one of us who can project
[42:44] this or make manifest without Christ in
[42:49] us he's always been above us hallelujah
[42:53] but we need him in us too
[42:57] God has got a man stationed in the
[42:59] tabernacle did you know that every time
[43:03] you come to church there is a guest and
[43:08] we always welcome him huh yeah he said
[43:16] there's always a man stationed in this
[43:19] Tabernacle this morning he called he's
[43:23] called the Holy Spirit he knows the
[43:28] secrets of your heart he knows
[43:30] everything that you're doing or what you
[43:33] think he tells the father everything
[43:35] that you do he brings a message back and
[43:38] forth whew
[43:40] he says and he has told me that you
[43:44] waited and you worked and you've labored
[43:47] patiently waiting for me to come now
[43:50] you've been a slave for a long time but
[43:53] now your slave days are over
[43:55] I have brought along the minister
[44:00] talking with excuse me this is was a
[44:03] secret catching away to seek a sudden
[44:06] secret so you understand he taught my
[44:07] the young girl a man who the rancher son
[44:10] uh-huh yeah and she began to plan and
[44:14] she made herself ready right so you'll
[44:17] know where I'm coming from and now he
[44:19] says listen I have brought along the
[44:21] minister right under this rose a
[44:24] treeless you can become my wife he
[44:28] kissed her he put the wedding ring on
[44:30] her finger and picked her up and set her
[44:33] in the back board with his arms around
[44:36] her and drove off to find this new
[44:39] beautiful big place only out of drive of
[44:43] a Chicago now I just dropped that in but
[44:45] that's that's what he's saying
[44:46] so you could understand Amen he typed
[44:49] out the rapture in this and the choosing
[44:52] of a bride someone's simple but full of
[44:55] character right why she was ready she
[45:02] had lived and been the kind of a woman
[45:05] that he wanted it happened
[45:09] as despair at the moment and that sudden
[45:13] secret coming of the Lord the world
[45:16] don't know it is going to happen but we
[45:19] do it's at hand don't be like the young
[45:23] lady they stripped the clothes from in
[45:25] Pearl Harbor and go down and disgrace be
[45:29] like the one who made herself ready and
[45:31] kept her virtues and was waiting for the
[45:34] coming of the Lord
[45:35] cause it's be a secret and sudden so now
[45:40] you think God is going to I'm coming in
[45:44] about another two hours
[45:48] no it's not going to be anything like
[45:50] that it's going to be a sudden quick
[45:52] thing yeah that's the way it goes that's
[45:58] the way God has it coming and we must be
[46:01] ready that's why it's important to keep
[46:03] your virtues you know he's you always
[46:05] test it there every day you're tested
[46:11] you tried right in those areas and if
[46:16] you don't keep in prayer yield not to
[46:20] temptation or yuning if you're not
[46:26] careful you will yield to sin no cuz why
[46:30] this flesh is not perfected yet and he
[46:38] sent Jesus that his blood might be an
[46:42] atonement blood automa to make a
[46:45] perpetuation an exception or cleansing a
[46:50] cleansing process to constantly not just
[46:54] one time one revival but every living
[46:57] making intercessions that the Christian
[47:00] is kept clean day and night there is a
[47:03] blood of Jesus Christ that makes an
[47:05] exception on the cross there in the
[47:09] presence of God that cleanses us
[47:11] constantly day and night from all sin
[47:15] and we are safely tucked in what are you
[47:20] talking about that's why the Bible know
[47:23] you're going
[47:23] confess and as soon as you make a
[47:25] mistake you said Lord forgive me and the
[47:29] blood has cleansed you before you make
[47:32] your confession cleanses you day and
[47:36] night
[47:37] that's one proof you got something if a
[47:40] man can confess and ask for forgiveness
[47:41] that's proof he's got something and
[47:44] that's a witness he believed in the
[47:46] cleansing power of the blood Oh
[47:52] hallelujah he that heareth my word and
[47:57] believeth on him that sent me has
[48:00] everlasting life and shall never come
[48:03] into the judgment but has passed from
[48:06] death unto life that's you see that's
[48:08] why we preach do you know why we preach
[48:10] because the Bible said judgment begins
[48:12] at the house of God yo trial or your
[48:16] judgment is now that's that's the grace
[48:20] and mercy of God and as long as we can
[48:22] say yes Lord that's me forgive me
[48:25] cleanse me respond to the world in in a
[48:29] way of humility you your your right with
[48:32] God you'll never come to that judgment
[48:35] ever hallelujah is that Alright my
[48:48] attorney student might see what it is
[48:49] the Christian never goes to the judgment
[48:51] Christ went for him my attorney stood in
[48:56] my place he pleaded my case that's all
[48:59] word that I was ignorant he told me the
[49:02] father that I was wasn't worthy that I
[49:05] was ignorant oh thank God for my
[49:08] ignorance that's one time I'm glad I was
[49:13] ignorant but he loved me and he took my
[49:17] place and pleaded my case and took and
[49:20] today I'm free that's what I'm trying to
[49:24] tell you you're free if you can really
[49:27] see the power of the blood and what
[49:29] Jesus Christ has done for you you said
[49:31] what brother Brooks I'm not there yet
[49:33] you're like Abraham you call those
[49:34] things that be
[49:35] as though they were as long as you speak
[49:39] you're perfect you'll come to perfection
[49:41] it will manifest itself the life of God
[49:47] will manifest itself according to your
[49:50] confession is that right the project God
[49:53] said we have an angel that must bring
[49:55] those confessions to pass you confess it
[50:00] there's an angel says Lord he says he's
[50:03] this that angel will make it and help
[50:06] you bring that to pass it's a ministry
[50:09] that they have and has been ordained by
[50:12] God God is love I think God for the
[50:21] unseen huh you say what yeah yeah thank
[50:27] God is those unseen ministries that
[50:30] really helps us along is that right the
[50:36] boughs of the angel of the lord encamps
[50:37] about those circle you you closed and
[50:46] shut in camp about those that fear him
[50:49] right God is loving you just can't do
[50:53] nothing but love when God comes into you
[50:57] it's love brotherly love for one another
[50:59] not one-way love is not one way love
[51:04] goes two ways right
[51:06] hey now in the earth when Jesus was here
[51:09] God is almighty and he doesn't get
[51:12] smarter he's to save all the time do you
[51:17] believe that the human race gets smarter
[51:20] the Bible said they would they be weak
[51:22] and wiser but God is infinite we are
[51:28] finite we keep we keep each year well
[51:32] you know our science I'm moving on
[51:34] building better automobiles and our
[51:36] education is better than that God
[51:38] doesn't get in East but God doesn't get
[51:40] any smarter
[51:41] he's perfect to begin with so my
[51:44] question is why should we ever doubt
[51:48] someone
[51:49] not only smarter but perfect that means
[51:54] he can't make it as a bad decision every
[51:58] decision he has already made it's
[52:00] perfect you saw a lot why am I going
[52:03] through this because that is the perfect
[52:05] trial for you that's the perfect test I
[52:11] don't have to worry about you getting on
[52:12] my knees with your knees with discus
[52:14] soon as you get lifted up a little bit I
[52:16] know what the boom put turn it on right
[52:23] soon as you think you got it all
[52:25] together
[52:26] oh yeah there's no pride in me so every
[52:29] time you think you let your flesh get up
[52:31] in your face then I'm gonna hit the
[52:34] switch god knows what he's doing and I
[52:41] can't fight your battle and you can
[52:43] fight mine it's already cut its padding
[52:47] for every personality in here yours is
[52:50] different from mine and mine is because
[52:51] I tell you what some of y'all battles I
[52:53] wouldn't I'm going through some stuff
[52:56] now but I tell you what if I had a
[52:58] choice I'm gonna keep what I got
[53:00] hallelujah keep what you got and I'm
[53:02] gonna keep what I have cuz I couldn't do
[53:04] I couldn't do some of the things I know
[53:06] I just I know me yeah you know it would
[53:12] take a diner and riding for sho brothers
[53:14] yeah I wouldn't there would be no other
[53:16] way you know and it's the truth it's
[53:19] nothing but the truth
[53:21] hallelujah so don't they don't ever
[53:23] think I don't pray for some of the
[53:24] people God is so real to us and he knows
[53:29] what we can pair he knows what we can
[53:32] handle but let me say it like this the
[53:34] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[53:36] by the Lord there's no way you can get
[53:38] out of it even the probably God wanted
[53:41] to leave he said honey I told my wife
[53:43] you know I really wouldn't mind leaving
[53:45] here now and and brother BAM said God
[53:48] said what are you doing trying to get
[53:49] out of it
[53:51] God knows we be trying to get out why
[53:55] don't you just shorten my days or
[53:57] something yeah you know make me perfect
[53:59] so I could get out of here he's gonna
[54:01] make you perfect and then you're gonna
[54:02] get
[54:04] in his time the Bible said he makes all
[54:07] things beautiful in his time hallelujah
[54:13] mmm a certain situation Rises and God
[54:17] calls on the scene to act the way the
[54:21] way God acts at that time he has to act
[54:24] every time and when the same
[54:27] circumstances arise again he has to act
[54:29] the same way he did this first time or
[54:32] he acted wrong the way he acted the
[54:35] first time in other words if there was a
[54:37] sinner calling for mercy and God saved
[54:40] that sinner the next Center calls God
[54:43] got to act the same way so were you
[54:49] talking about brother Brooks my point is
[54:51] this every man the Bible said if a man
[54:54] called on the name of Jesus for
[54:55] salvation he is then passed from death
[54:58] unto life and he can no longer he cannot
[55:01] come into the judgment y'all hear what
[55:05] I'm saying
[55:06] now you and I that that sound like it's
[55:09] just too simple it is but it's so
[55:12] powerful and it meant was this it means
[55:15] what it says and it said we're not
[55:17] talking about I have hearted confession
[55:20] I'm coming to sincere confession from
[55:22] the heart God has to accept it because
[55:27] those are the only kind that he can you
[55:30] know he'll somebody come to the altar
[55:32] popping gum and laughing and stuff like
[55:33] that and get down on their knees they're
[55:35] gonna go back the same way they came
[55:37] because they came in such an irreverent
[55:39] way God look for a broken and contrite
[55:42] spirit that's what pleases God right mmm
[55:47] see you gotta understand I'm almost done
[55:50] with this portion but I want you to
[55:51] understand that sincerity is one thing
[55:56] and got it God respect sincerity but in
[56:00] our sincerity we must understand that's
[56:02] why the message came the message came to
[56:04] put us in our proper place in while we
[56:08] are sincere because you can be sincere
[56:11] and sincerely wrong right
[56:15] and in my example was for this when
[56:18] david amen took the Ark of the Covenant
[56:21] and he was sincere he wanted to worship
[56:24] God but he built a cart and he put the
[56:29] Ark of the Covenant on wheels which was
[56:32] a shadow and a type of organization
[56:33] denomination it was not the Word of God
[56:36] because you got to realize that man that
[56:38] the Ark of the Covenant was to be
[56:40] carried above the Levi's heart on their
[56:43] shoulder on that side but so it was out
[56:47] of the word was out of all it was
[56:49] misplaced and so therefore when you
[56:52] misplace the word God can't bless it you
[56:56] sure what do you mean they shouted they
[56:59] danced the music play
[57:01] they were happy it looked like a real
[57:03] revival that David was carrying on but
[57:06] one of David's sincere men when he saw
[57:09] the ark tilt he went to stay it in his
[57:14] sincerity he was killed right so
[57:18] understand you can't help the ministry
[57:22] whenever you put your hand to the
[57:24] ministry to help it in that way you die
[57:30] spiritually in other words if you're not
[57:34] called to preach you don't go preach you
[57:37] out order you've misplaced the word so I
[57:41] so all I'm a woman and I know I can
[57:44] preach God didn't say you couldn't he
[57:46] said you should because Amen is not in
[57:51] the woman's position to be a preacher oh
[57:54] they got it so bad now they got an
[57:57] assistant pastors some pastors are they
[58:04] anointed yes so was David how they look
[58:09] like they're getting results yes so did
[58:11] David but because they are because they
[58:15] can't put the word in the wrong place it
[58:20] was never supposed to be on the
[58:21] organization of the denomination it was
[58:23] supposed to be carried upon the heart
[58:24] and God did what semi
[58:29] sincere man in a ministry that he was
[58:35] not called to be in hello and I say this
[58:42] to say I said put it together the way
[58:47] brother Bailey did he said by doing this
[58:49] he caused the death of a sincere man
[58:52] putting his hand on the ark when he
[58:54] shouldn't have done it a great sincere
[58:58] man think the anointing and everything
[59:01] was just right but the ark was moving in
[59:04] its wrong way I've got friends you know
[59:10] even women friends who are preachers
[59:12] pastors whatever they are they can't
[59:15] believe this message because they are
[59:18] anointed when they preach but let me ask
[59:23] you a question how can a woman even in
[59:27] her preaching bring forth genuine life
[59:33] naturally it can't be done because the
[59:37] woman carries the egg it is a man who
[59:42] carries the seed you see and in that
[59:47] scenario that's why I woman can't preach
[59:50] or shouldn't because because of of the
[59:54] anointing doesn't even mean that it is
[59:57] the truth 19 and listen a false
[1:00:03] revelation of the word will bring a
[1:00:06] false experience Satan will make sure it
[1:00:11] happens he's going to make sure by
[1:00:15] that's why I try to tell people I said
[1:00:17] oh we are nothing that's good but what
[1:00:21] are you preaching see you know look at
[1:00:25] all the calls they all have a 19th of
[1:00:27] some kind if it ain't Jesus is something
[1:00:30] else now I would tell you like the
[1:00:32] prophet of God said he said they're
[1:00:34] going to be surprised when they realize
[1:00:38] they were not worshipping Jesus Christ
[1:00:42] oh but the anointing Satan has disguised
[1:00:48] himself as the angel of light and we
[1:00:52] know that demons travel by Trinity yes
[1:01:01] that's how they travel not all God's
[1:01:05] gonna there's got to be you know I just
[1:01:07] go by the church ages the Bible tells us
[1:01:09] that in the 3rd 3rd chapter of
[1:01:11] Revelation Jesus was outside the door
[1:01:13] now if he's outside who's inside there's
[1:01:19] an ax posture somewhere there's
[1:01:21] something that's pretending to be the
[1:01:23] holy ghost because the holy ghost will
[1:01:25] change your nature and when you can see
[1:01:29] people Amen that's in I'm talking about
[1:01:31] even around here when when that Holy
[1:01:35] Ghost is in you and it's not changing
[1:01:36] your nature something wrong with the
[1:01:38] experience it has to change your nature
[1:01:45] it must change your nature if it ain't
[1:01:49] changing your nature there's an imposter
[1:01:51] somewhere that's why we can't say oh I
[1:01:53] spoke in tongues or I shouted or I
[1:01:56] danced all those those things are good
[1:01:58] and in the devil can do them all but if
[1:02:01] this message that's been preached and
[1:02:03] been you heard is not changing you from
[1:02:06] glory to glory to glory little by little
[1:02:09] something wrong somewhere
[1:02:13] something's wrong there's no way you can
[1:02:16] listen to this that was behind the
[1:02:18] curtain this message came from the
[1:02:21] Shekinah it didn't come from a
[1:02:24] Theological Seminary it didn't come from
[1:02:26] no organization this message came from
[1:02:29] behind the veil and that word that was
[1:02:32] behind the veil transformed a rod it
[1:02:37] made it bud and bloom ah bloom and bring
[1:02:39] forth almonds yeah this message all you
[1:02:43] have to do is stand still and see the
[1:02:45] salvation of the Lord you keep reading
[1:02:47] you keep eating you keep feeding and it
[1:02:50] would transform you you won't have to
[1:02:53] work it does all the work
[1:02:56] that's the way it is that's what grace
[1:02:58] is all about that's our Liberty you love
[1:03:02] the Lord oh I just get stirred she the
[1:03:09] oxen the Bible said stumbled not the
[1:03:13] Levi the oxen stumbled and the cart was
[1:03:16] being pitched over and a sincere man
[1:03:18] with his heart full of love put his hand
[1:03:21] upon the ark to hold it back and was
[1:03:23] stricken and dead because no man could
[1:03:26] touch the ark but a Levite see how God
[1:03:30] keeps his word keeps his candle
[1:03:32] keep his order as I had was smitten with
[1:03:35] leprosy here is David and altogether
[1:03:37] caused the death of man and a great
[1:03:40] disaster being anointed with the spirit
[1:03:43] both of them but out of God's channel
[1:03:49] that is the worst thing that could
[1:03:52] possibly happen to a brother or sister
[1:03:56] that when they come to their time to
[1:04:00] cross over they realized that they have
[1:04:04] been deceived and the Bible says
[1:04:09] there'll be many many in that day that
[1:04:14] will be deceived
[1:04:16] he said only a few be that find it
[1:04:20] he talked about the world the whirling
[1:04:23] trying to find Jesus you talk about
[1:04:26] Christians or those who call themselves
[1:04:28] Christians and think about the many that
[1:04:31] are receiving the mark of the beast
[1:04:32] because the truth comes to them and they
[1:04:35] reject it you better bet you would have
[1:04:39] been better to remain you know being an
[1:04:41] organization never heard this you
[1:04:44] understand me
[1:04:45] yeah but called God I have mercy on a
[1:04:48] man or woman who's never heard because
[1:04:50] they didn't have an opportunity to
[1:04:52] reject but you said with this message
[1:04:54] now let's go to the just a simplicity a
[1:04:56] man or woman who comes through the
[1:04:58] knowledge that baptism in the name of
[1:05:00] the Lord Jesus Christ is correct
[1:05:02] and because their system believes in the
[1:05:04] Father Son and Holy Ghost they are
[1:05:05] afraid that be persecuted so they stay
[1:05:07] with the system other than moving with
[1:05:09] the word
[1:05:10] and at that time they received the mark
[1:05:13] of the beast don't even know it you know
[1:05:15] what happens angel of deception comes
[1:05:18] and mark them and they'll never see it
[1:05:22] ever again so you got to see it and
[1:05:24] understand that you know me you come to
[1:05:26] the knowledge that means an
[1:05:28] understanding it's right and you refuse
[1:05:30] it
[1:05:31] because of your system so it is in this
[1:05:34] message so is it with this it don't stop
[1:05:39] it constantly cuz God constantly
[1:05:41] progress it all right and if God began
[1:05:45] to reveal and show us like right now
[1:05:47] trying to play me come tell us amen it
[1:05:50] is the Lord Jesus Christ it can only be
[1:05:52] the Lord Jesus Christ there's only one
[1:05:54] to be glorified he larger than a lie
[1:05:57] didn't grow if I himself
[1:05:58] is that right Moses didn't glorify
[1:06:00] himself if you understand me only one
[1:06:03] can be glorified and that is the Lord
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ
[1:06:06] you love the Lord we appreciate it we're
[1:06:09] just gonna stop their message of freedom
