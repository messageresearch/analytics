[57:09] lord you've touched these lives
[57:12] and we've gathered in your name tonight
[57:14] oh lord
[57:16] we did not come because we needed a
[57:18] place to go we came because we wanted to
[57:22] be in fellowship
[57:24] with one another and with our lord
[57:28] now father we want to thank you that
[57:30] you're here
[57:31] i pray that you will just
[57:35] hide your servant
[57:37] speak to us lord from your word
[57:41] may you get honor and glory
[57:46] anything that would
[57:48] be among us
[57:50] that we might have drug in here with us
[57:52] that would disturb the atmosphere
[57:55] lord we
[57:58] are speaking to it now that it has to be
[58:00] silent
[58:04] if it's something that has to be picked
[58:06] up in a little while so be it but right
[58:09] now it needs to be silent
[58:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[58:14] we have come to have fellowship with you
[58:19] we bless you and give you praise for it
[58:22] is in the name of the lord jesus christ
[58:24] [Music]
[58:26] amen
[58:28] god bless you saints of god it's sure an
[58:30] honor to be here with you tonight
[58:33] while you're standing if you have your
[58:35] bibles let's read from the book of
[58:36] ephesians chapter 5.
[58:41] i'll turn this other one on
[58:48] does that get it
[58:50] that's that's got us on all right
[58:59] ephesians chapter 5
[59:02] verse 1
[59:05] be therefore followers of god
[59:08] as dear children
[59:11] and walk in love as christ also hath
[59:14] loved us and had given himself for us an
[59:18] offering and a sacrifice to god for a
[59:21] sweet smelling savor
[59:24] but fornication and all uncleanness and
[59:27] covetousness
[59:28] let it not be once named among you as
[59:31] become a saints
[59:33] neither filthiness
[59:35] nor foolish talking
[59:37] nor jesting which are not convenient
[59:40] but rather giving of thanks
[59:43] for this you know that no whoremonger
[59:45] nor unclean person nor covetous man who
[59:48] is an idolater hath any inheritance in
[59:50] the kingdom of christ and of god
[59:54] let no man deceive you with vain words
[59:56] for because of these things cometh the
[59:59] wrath of god upon the children of
[1:00:00] disobedience
[1:00:03] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[1:00:06] for you were sometimes darkness
[1:00:09] but now are you light in the lord
[1:00:12] walk as children of light
[1:00:16] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[1:00:18] goodness and righteousness and truth
[1:00:21] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[1:00:25] and have no fellowship with the
[1:00:26] unfruitful works of darkness
[1:00:29] but rather reprove them
[1:00:31] for it is a shame even to speak of those
[1:00:35] things which are done of them
[1:00:38] in secret
[1:00:39] but all things that are reproved are
[1:00:43] made manifest by the light
[1:00:46] for whatsoever doth make manifest
[1:00:50] is light
[1:00:52] may the lord add a blessing to the
[1:00:54] reading of his word you may have your
[1:00:55] seats tonight
[1:01:01] before we
[1:01:03] start preaching
[1:01:05] just give you a little background of
[1:01:07] myself
[1:01:09] as brother isaiah said i'm
[1:01:11] brother wes greeley my wife's sister
[1:01:13] joyce
[1:01:14] i'm so thankful that she is with me
[1:01:19] i
[1:01:20] have had a different journey than
[1:01:21] brother brooks has had and
[1:01:25] god knows everything that is necessary
[1:01:28] for our journey and so he puts it in our
[1:01:31] path what we need to refine us to make
[1:01:34] us what we are who we are what we need
[1:01:37] to be and uh
[1:01:40] my father is a pastor he's now 83 years
[1:01:43] old still pastors a little church in
[1:01:45] virginia
[1:01:46] and
[1:01:47] he has
[1:01:49] preached this message this end time
[1:01:51] message since 1970 i was born in 69
[1:01:56] in 1968 my father moved
[1:02:00] my
[1:02:01] mother and my
[1:02:03] well four older sisters at that time
[1:02:06] uh to from baltimore maryland to
[1:02:09] union city pennsylvania
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:13] my father says that that was his
[1:02:15] backside of the desert experience
[1:02:19] and
[1:02:21] as
[1:02:21] a grown adult now preaching this end
[1:02:24] time message
[1:02:26] i am personally thankful
[1:02:28] for his backside of the desert
[1:02:31] experience
[1:02:32] because god put him in that place
[1:02:35] separated from a lot of
[1:02:38] the isms and the doctrines of the
[1:02:41] message that you hear about and so it
[1:02:44] kept him separated from that and it made
[1:02:47] him a more balanced man
[1:02:49] uh and and even though we attended some
[1:02:53] meetings of some of the different what
[1:02:55] i'll call sex or isms of the message
[1:02:59] daddy would always go back home to his
[1:03:01] desert
[1:03:02] and he would he would seek the lord
[1:03:04] about it and he would find out what he
[1:03:07] needed for himself his family and for
[1:03:10] his church
[1:03:12] and it caused him to be balanced through
[1:03:14] the years and so
[1:03:16] again as a preacher i appreciate the
[1:03:19] balance that he kept through the years
[1:03:22] uh
[1:03:23] not a hundred percent because all of us
[1:03:26] are growing we're maturing but i thank
[1:03:29] god tonight for uh being raised in a
[1:03:33] christian home a home that believed this
[1:03:36] message of truth and and that
[1:03:39] it was
[1:03:41] it was not just handed to him
[1:03:44] from one generation to the next but it
[1:03:47] was something that he fought for
[1:03:51] and when you fight for something you're
[1:03:53] more likely to hold on to it
[1:03:56] if it's given to you
[1:03:58] as easy you're more likely to be
[1:04:01] somebody who would let go of it with
[1:04:04] ease that's why we see a great falling
[1:04:06] away because it has been passed from one
[1:04:09] generation to another and they felt like
[1:04:12] that
[1:04:13] it was just kind of a free ride for them
[1:04:16] but this truth of god is not a free ride
[1:04:20] it is something that has to be
[1:04:22] continually fought for
[1:04:24] we can look in our precious united
[1:04:27] states of america and we can see as it
[1:04:30] goes from one generation to another
[1:04:33] generation you see
[1:04:36] there was a generation that was willing
[1:04:38] to fight a foreign war to be able to
[1:04:42] have freedom in the united states and
[1:04:46] when they came home they did not want
[1:04:48] their children to have to fight the same
[1:04:51] kind of wars that they fought for and so
[1:04:54] they tried to make life a little bit
[1:04:56] easier for that next generation and they
[1:05:00] were they worked hard to be able to give
[1:05:03] them something that
[1:05:05] so they wouldn't have to go and fight a
[1:05:07] war like they did
[1:05:09] then that generation became a little
[1:05:12] softer and they gave it to the next
[1:05:15] generation and now that generation is
[1:05:18] the one that we see
[1:05:20] that is about to repeat history because
[1:05:23] they didn't have to fight for what they
[1:05:25] got
[1:05:26] it was handed to them but we as the
[1:05:29] people of god we can see that the
[1:05:31] natural types the spiritual and there's
[1:05:34] a generation that has been handed
[1:05:36] something they didn't have to fight for
[1:05:39] it they didn't have to work for it they
[1:05:42] didn't have to pioneer it the pioneer
[1:05:45] anything they didn't have to fight the
[1:05:47] same battles that the previous
[1:05:49] generation and the previous generation
[1:05:52] fought for and so now they're a bunch of
[1:05:55] man be pambi uh children that expect
[1:05:59] everything to be handed to them and so
[1:06:02] they're not willing to fight for this
[1:06:04] message of truth they're not willing to
[1:06:06] hold on to anything and so we find out
[1:06:09] that people are falling away but there
[1:06:12] is a people who are willing to stand in
[1:06:15] this end time and they're willing to
[1:06:17] fight for what they got they're willing
[1:06:20] to stand on truth and say i'm gonna
[1:06:22] stand if everybody else falls away if
[1:06:25] everybody else just gets to the side
[1:06:28] gets to the side i'm gonna stand for the
[1:06:30] truth and i'm going to let the world go
[1:06:32] by
[1:06:34] because when we're handed a truth there
[1:06:37] is a responsibility
[1:06:39] that we have to hold on to that truth
[1:06:42] with everything we've got
[1:06:46] my father fought for it
[1:06:50] and i
[1:06:52] as a child
[1:06:54] a family of ten i have
[1:06:56] nine siblings one has already gone on to
[1:06:59] glory
[1:07:00] but
[1:07:02] by the grace of god because of the
[1:07:04] balance that my father kept
[1:07:07] all of us
[1:07:08] attend churches that believe this end
[1:07:10] time truth
[1:07:12] some are more steady than others
[1:07:15] but you know why that some are more
[1:07:17] steady than others because they've
[1:07:18] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:22] that is the only thing that's going to
[1:07:23] keep us in the end time
[1:07:25] that this is another thing that i've
[1:07:27] noticed through the years because people
[1:07:30] have not been willing to fight through
[1:07:33] to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:36] when i was growing up
[1:07:38] i heard so many things i i would go to
[1:07:41] meetings with my dad and my mom and i
[1:07:43] would i would hear these different
[1:07:45] things and i would hear preachers talk
[1:07:47] about all you got to do is believe the
[1:07:49] word well yes you've got to believe the
[1:07:52] word that's the first thing you've got
[1:07:54] to do
[1:07:55] even to call on the name of the lord our
[1:07:58] god you have to believe
[1:08:01] and that is the beginning of our of our
[1:08:04] salvation experiences to believe that he
[1:08:07] is and that he's a rewarder of those
[1:08:10] that diligently seek him and if we
[1:08:13] diligently seek him he's willing to keep
[1:08:16] us and to guide us and to strengthen us
[1:08:19] but that's not the end of the experience
[1:08:22] and brother brooks comes from a
[1:08:24] background where that they they believe
[1:08:27] that speaking in tongues well my wife
[1:08:29] comes from a similar background and
[1:08:33] where that speaking in tongues was the
[1:08:36] height of all of it
[1:08:38] and so
[1:08:39] the the growing up you would hear
[1:08:42] preachers and they created such an
[1:08:45] opposite thing to that that it almost
[1:08:49] seemed as though
[1:08:50] tongues was not even a part of the
[1:08:52] christian experience they created such
[1:08:55] an opposite uh thought about it and
[1:08:58] growing up i personally i'm giving you
[1:09:01] my testimony i personally had
[1:09:05] really come to a place where that i
[1:09:07] didn't care whether i ever
[1:09:10] gained that experience of the holy ghost
[1:09:12] and speaking in tongues and and allowing
[1:09:15] the spirit of god to work through me
[1:09:17] that it was something that i had to work
[1:09:20] through
[1:09:21] by the spirit of god and growing up as a
[1:09:24] teenager there's all of these things
[1:09:26] that reach out and grab a hold of you
[1:09:29] and they they want to capture your mind
[1:09:32] and as an adult they want to capture
[1:09:34] your mind friends when you get to my age
[1:09:37] or you get to older than than i am
[1:09:40] brother brooks and this brother i'm
[1:09:42] pointing them out because i know they're
[1:09:44] ancient men and that they fight the same
[1:09:47] kind of battles that i do and because
[1:09:50] this greatest battle that was ever
[1:09:52] fought is still being fought in the
[1:09:55] earth today it is not a battle of flesh
[1:09:59] and blood although sometimes we make it
[1:10:02] that way
[1:10:04] as as part of a church family we tend to
[1:10:08] create flesh and blood fight but this is
[1:10:11] not a flesh and blood fight this is a
[1:10:14] fight of principalities and powers that
[1:10:17] are above our head and there's a war
[1:10:19] going on in the heavenlies at all times
[1:10:22] and they're out to capture the minds and
[1:10:25] the hearts of anybody that they can
[1:10:27] capture because they desire
[1:10:30] to
[1:10:31] corrupt and to cause us to be stunted in
[1:10:35] our growth with the lord and it is
[1:10:38] constantly that a believer has to
[1:10:40] wrestle those things down and we have to
[1:10:42] capture our thoughts and wrestle down to
[1:10:45] the ground all of these things that come
[1:10:48] against us in such a way that we can't
[1:10:52] weak with our natural eyes we can't see
[1:10:54] this battle that's raging
[1:10:57] but we can we can feel this battle
[1:10:59] that's raging we can experience it we
[1:11:03] are experiencing it and we are trying by
[1:11:06] the grace of god to put the enemy on the
[1:11:09] run and i tell you what puts the enemy
[1:11:11] on the run and that's when we do like we
[1:11:14] did tonight we come in and recreate an
[1:11:16] atmosphere by lifting up a praise to the
[1:11:19] lord and saying lord i'm gonna press my
[1:11:22] way through even if even if i'm having a
[1:11:25] hard time when i come in
[1:11:28] sometimes it's a little slow
[1:11:30] sometimes it feels like
[1:11:33] it's all that you can do to put one foot
[1:11:35] in front of the other but oh when we
[1:11:38] press through to praise the lord and
[1:11:40] then there's the breakthrough all the
[1:11:43] breakthrough makes all the struggle
[1:11:45] worth all the effort that there was to
[1:11:47] get there
[1:11:49] as a teenager just fighting all of these
[1:11:52] battles i went to public school and i
[1:11:56] dealt with some of the
[1:11:58] stuff that was going around at that time
[1:12:00] and
[1:12:01] i think about some of these children
[1:12:03] what they face today and how awful it is
[1:12:06] and and i feel like that my going to
[1:12:09] school and what i faced was nearly a
[1:12:11] picnic compared to what they're facing
[1:12:14] today
[1:12:15] and and all of the garbage that you can
[1:12:17] get a hold of right on this thing here
[1:12:19] how that the enemy is putting it right
[1:12:22] out there right in the hands of these
[1:12:24] young people and i think about how that
[1:12:26] the enemy works on their minds and the
[1:12:28] things that they hide from their parents
[1:12:31] and they hide from one another and how
[1:12:33] that the enemy is constantly moving and
[1:12:36] i didn't have to fight that same kind of
[1:12:38] battle when i was a teenager but yet i
[1:12:40] had the battle that i had to face of
[1:12:43] whether
[1:12:44] i was going to try to ride the coattail
[1:12:47] of my daddy preacher
[1:12:49] or whether i was going to give my life
[1:12:50] to the lord jesus christ
[1:12:53] and i can remember
[1:12:54] my sister debbie who is the one that the
[1:12:57] lord chose to take about six years ago
[1:13:00] five six years ago
[1:13:01] and she came to me in in one summer and
[1:13:05] she must have had
[1:13:07] uh some kind of a
[1:13:09] understanding maybe she just watched a
[1:13:12] little closer than some of the rest of
[1:13:14] them did and she said i think it'd be a
[1:13:16] good idea
[1:13:18] for you to go to youth camp in ohio
[1:13:21] and
[1:13:23] you know
[1:13:26] we talk about people getting saved
[1:13:30] and
[1:13:33] kneeling down at an altar
[1:13:36] crying out to god
[1:13:39] for some that's the way it happened
[1:13:44] but as i look back on my journey
[1:13:48] and i
[1:13:50] watch what the lord did in my life
[1:13:54] just from her talking to me that
[1:13:55] particular day asking me to go to a
[1:13:58] youth camp my life changed from that
[1:14:02] moment
[1:14:04] that moment
[1:14:05] i didn't call on the lord
[1:14:08] i didn't ask his forgiveness at that
[1:14:09] moment
[1:14:11] i did not say lord forgive me of all my
[1:14:13] sins
[1:14:14] i didn't do any of that
[1:14:17] but my life started changing
[1:14:20] from that moment
[1:14:21] and i knew that the holy spirit had had
[1:14:25] done something for me because my desires
[1:14:28] had changed from that time
[1:14:31] now
[1:14:32] the way that the lord works the way he
[1:14:34] does things he draws us by his holy
[1:14:37] spirit and he knows because he is
[1:14:40] omnipotent because he knows the end from
[1:14:44] the beginning he knows our yeses all
[1:14:47] along the way he knows because that
[1:14:50] there would be a future event that would
[1:14:52] happen he knew that he didn't have to
[1:14:55] put me on my knees right at that very
[1:14:58] moment he was changing some things from
[1:15:00] day to day to get me to a place where i
[1:15:03] was going to get in an atmosphere at a
[1:15:06] youth camp that was going to so
[1:15:08] radically changed my life that i would
[1:15:11] never be the same and so
[1:15:14] i went to the youth camp i was 18 years
[1:15:17] old i had just graduated high school
[1:15:21] and i went to this youth camp and it so
[1:15:23] happened to be
[1:15:25] that somebody else had
[1:15:27] booked this particular campground that
[1:15:29] year
[1:15:30] and uh
[1:15:32] so the camp had to be moved from one
[1:15:34] place to another and as this move was
[1:15:38] taking place
[1:15:40] uh
[1:15:41] i had my dad's van and
[1:15:44] we drove to the next campground and it
[1:15:47] was very primitive
[1:15:50] and as the director of the camp
[1:15:54] everybody had a place to sleep
[1:15:58] but somehow my name had been overlooked
[1:16:02] and
[1:16:06] so amazed at
[1:16:07] the sovereignty of god and how he works
[1:16:09] things
[1:16:13] i told the director i said
[1:16:15] got the whole back end of this van
[1:16:18] i can sleep in the back of this van he
[1:16:20] says oh no
[1:16:22] i got a place for you
[1:16:25] i got a place for you to sleep
[1:16:28] well i not only got one of the best
[1:16:31] places on the whole campground to sleep
[1:16:34] i was bunking with the preachers
[1:16:39] apparently
[1:16:42] i know apparently about it god saw ahead
[1:16:44] of time
[1:16:46] that he was going to call me into the
[1:16:47] ministry
[1:16:48] and he was
[1:16:50] putting me right there in the middle of
[1:16:51] all those preachers i had a better
[1:16:53] shower than all the rest of the kids did
[1:16:55] and and somehow god just saw fit to
[1:17:00] place me there
[1:17:01] but
[1:17:04] although all of that was beautiful
[1:17:07] there came a night
[1:17:10] that a birth took place
[1:17:13] it was a messy birth
[1:17:16] it was a slobbering snotting birth
[1:17:20] it was a birth that forever changed my
[1:17:23] life that forever changed who i am and
[1:17:27] it forever changed
[1:17:29] my thoughts about a lot of things and
[1:17:32] god set me on a course
[1:17:35] to
[1:17:36] pursue him with everything that was
[1:17:38] within me
[1:17:40] and after that particular night i spent
[1:17:43] until 4 30 in the morning up under the
[1:17:46] trailer uh that what they were using as
[1:17:49] a platform and and this is my testimony
[1:17:52] yours is probably different than mine
[1:17:55] but old friend if you've not received
[1:17:57] the baptism of the holy ghost i
[1:18:00] challenge you to get before god and if
[1:18:03] it's in a church building if it's in
[1:18:05] your bedroom if it's under your bed
[1:18:07] whatever it takes you get to that place
[1:18:11] where that you
[1:18:12] know that you have the baptism of the
[1:18:16] holy ghost the same god that raised up
[1:18:20] jesus from the dead the same spirit if
[1:18:23] that same spirit that raised up jesus
[1:18:26] from the dead dwell in you it will also
[1:18:29] quicken your mortal body and it will
[1:18:32] raise you up into new heights of the
[1:18:34] holy spirit yes it will eventually take
[1:18:38] us on out of here
[1:18:41] but that spirit of god is given to us to
[1:18:45] quicken the inside of us to raise us up
[1:18:49] above the place where we are currently
[1:18:52] because we can get in a stuck position
[1:18:56] and when we get in a stuck position the
[1:19:00] enemy wants to hold us there and he
[1:19:02] wants us to think that everybody forgot
[1:19:05] about us even god he wants us to think
[1:19:08] that nobody cares about us and that
[1:19:11] we're not really qualified to be called
[1:19:13] a child of god no none of us are
[1:19:16] qualified to be called children of god
[1:19:19] there's nothing in us that qualifies us
[1:19:21] to be children of god but yet he called
[1:19:24] us just the same
[1:19:27] why why did he call me
[1:19:31] why did he call me why did he call you
[1:19:34] because he saw something in you
[1:19:37] that he knew
[1:19:38] that he could trust
[1:19:41] you say well i don't feel very
[1:19:42] trustworthy right this moment
[1:19:45] what's that got to do with it
[1:19:48] what do feelings have to do with it
[1:19:51] because god did not call us to go by our
[1:19:54] feelings you see
[1:19:56] back in the 50s and the 60s when brother
[1:19:58] branham was on the on the earth and he
[1:20:00] was he was trying to present to the
[1:20:03] people
[1:20:04] this thought that they did not have to
[1:20:07] remain in their sickness
[1:20:09] a lot of his ministry concerned the
[1:20:12] physical healing of the human body
[1:20:16] and this physical healing of the human
[1:20:18] body as he was preaching uh he was
[1:20:22] trying to get the people
[1:20:24] to look beyond how they felt
[1:20:30] so many times he would tell people
[1:20:34] you're healed
[1:20:36] and then they would respond but i don't
[1:20:38] feel healed
[1:20:40] and he would say that doesn't matter
[1:20:43] confess
[1:20:45] that you are healed
[1:20:48] by the confession of your mouth he said
[1:20:51] if you confess with your mouth then your
[1:20:54] body is going to respond to your
[1:20:56] confession
[1:20:58] and then your body will respond to that
[1:21:01] confession and there will come healing
[1:21:03] in your physical body
[1:21:05] and that was the outward man but really
[1:21:08] he was pointing forward to something
[1:21:11] that was much greater than the physical
[1:21:14] healing because he even said you're
[1:21:16] gonna die
[1:21:18] if you're healed tonight
[1:21:22] somewhere if you have 10 more 20 or 30
[1:21:25] more years and you have health for those
[1:21:28] 30 years you're probably going to get
[1:21:31] sick again and you're going to die it is
[1:21:34] a part of the cycle of life now we know
[1:21:37] by the grace of god that there is going
[1:21:39] to come a
[1:21:41] a rapture of the church and it's going
[1:21:43] to pull us up out of here
[1:21:46] but he was giving us this instruction
[1:21:50] because he wanted us to understand
[1:21:53] that we were fighting a battle
[1:21:57] in our mind that would affect the inner
[1:22:00] man
[1:22:01] and it would cause us to to even
[1:22:04] question whether we were a child of god
[1:22:07] or not
[1:22:08] we would question whether we were born
[1:22:10] again or not and he said he kept saying
[1:22:14] what the feelings have to do with it
[1:22:17] that's why he kept preaching to us that
[1:22:19] we could not base our experience on
[1:22:23] feelings
[1:22:28] and so that's what i grew up
[1:22:31] understanding you can't base your
[1:22:34] experience on feelings
[1:22:37] and
[1:22:38] because that you know
[1:22:40] as a child i thought as a child and i
[1:22:43] spoke as a child and i did childish
[1:22:46] things but as i grew up i begin to
[1:22:49] realize
[1:22:50] no i cannot base my experience on
[1:22:55] feelings but that doesn't negate the
[1:22:58] feelings that i have when i'm in the
[1:23:00] presence of the lord amen
[1:23:02] and as i went on my journey and
[1:23:05] i realized that i come up with a really
[1:23:08] really nasty attitude
[1:23:11] about speaking in tongues and god really
[1:23:14] had to deal with me hard
[1:23:17] he had to deal with me hard
[1:23:19] and
[1:23:20] and so it went through a period of
[1:23:23] several years again
[1:23:25] my precious wife came out of a
[1:23:26] pentecostal holiness church and and
[1:23:31] knew nothing of brother branham or the
[1:23:32] message or anything like that and and so
[1:23:35] that was all new to her and
[1:23:39] for many years
[1:23:40] uh
[1:23:42] it was a growing process and and quite
[1:23:45] frankly we're still growing together in
[1:23:47] the grace and the knowledge of the lord
[1:23:49] jesus christ and as we were talking
[1:23:51] today at the table and
[1:23:53] we were talking about things that we
[1:23:55] don't really understand but we just lay
[1:23:58] them aside for now because god gives
[1:24:00] progressive revelation
[1:24:03] and and he helps us to understand along
[1:24:06] the way uh things that we may not have
[1:24:09] understood in the past and he has to
[1:24:12] deal with us as sons every son that
[1:24:15] cometh to god has to be chastened has to
[1:24:18] be reproved has to have some things uh
[1:24:22] cut off of them and and so that's what
[1:24:24] god does with us that's what he was
[1:24:25] doing with me and i know that's what he
[1:24:28] does with you but don't lose hope
[1:24:31] amen don't lose faith
[1:24:34] when you feel the chastening of the lord
[1:24:37] that is really the time that we ought to
[1:24:40] throw up our hands and say thank you
[1:24:42] lord that you love me
[1:24:44] amen but that's the time that the enemy
[1:24:47] wants to beat us the hardest and tell us
[1:24:49] how unworthy we are and how worthless we
[1:24:52] are and or what failures we are but what
[1:24:55] we ought to do is is every once in a
[1:24:58] while just just tell him to shut his
[1:25:01] face
[1:25:03] just be quiet
[1:25:04] i was i was you know those things that
[1:25:07] roar around in our head and i was by
[1:25:10] myself on a job the other day and and he
[1:25:13] was just tormenting my mind the enemy
[1:25:15] was and finally i said devil just shut
[1:25:19] up
[1:25:20] amen just be quiet amen
[1:25:23] you're a liar just shut up
[1:25:27] and i started singing the praises of god
[1:25:30] and about an hour later i was back
[1:25:32] fighting him again and i had to tell him
[1:25:34] again devil
[1:25:36] just shut up
[1:25:40] i don't have to be polite to him
[1:25:44] he's not polite to me
[1:25:46] and i'm the blood-bought child of god
[1:25:49] amen and sometimes i just need to know
[1:25:52] that he's put in his place be quiet
[1:25:56] you have no voice in my life i will not
[1:26:00] allow you to have a voice in my life
[1:26:06] pardon me
[1:26:10] so you have to shut him down
[1:26:14] so
[1:26:15] we can't go by our feelings
[1:26:19] but yet
[1:26:20] we're a human being
[1:26:22] we all have feelings
[1:26:24] we all have things that we're dealing
[1:26:26] with
[1:26:28] and
[1:26:30] when we're feeling these things
[1:26:32] we
[1:26:36] everybody else is kind of shut out of
[1:26:39] our of our lives and
[1:26:41] what battle they're going through
[1:26:43] is irrelevant at the time because we're
[1:26:46] fighting our own battle
[1:26:48] and we have to just put the enemy in his
[1:26:51] place
[1:26:52] and it's not always easy to
[1:26:55] get to that place
[1:26:58] but by the grace of god
[1:27:00] it is doable amen
[1:27:03] and praise
[1:27:07] works the best
[1:27:09] against the devil
[1:27:12] amen amen declaring the word of god
[1:27:17] you see when jesus
[1:27:19] after jesus was baptized
[1:27:22] this is
[1:27:24] not preaching from ephesians 5 but let's
[1:27:26] go with it
[1:27:28] when jesus
[1:27:30] was baptized by john in the river jordan
[1:27:35] there was a voice that came from heaven
[1:27:37] that said
[1:27:39] this is my beloved son
[1:27:42] in whom i am well pleased
[1:27:46] and immediately
[1:27:48] jesus was driven into the wilderness
[1:27:56] well that was jesus
[1:28:00] well
[1:28:03] we start out our journey
[1:28:06] and
[1:28:08] we ask the lord to come into our lives
[1:28:12] and we are led on into a place where
[1:28:14] that we recognize that it is important
[1:28:17] for us
[1:28:18] to be baptized
[1:28:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:23] we want to obey the lord
[1:28:25] so we go into water and we're baptized
[1:28:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:32] taking on
[1:28:33] the name of the lord upon our lives
[1:28:37] and it's like immediately
[1:28:39] we're driven into the wilderness
[1:28:45] immediately
[1:28:47] we're driven into the wilderness
[1:28:50] and it feels like
[1:28:52] that we
[1:28:53] are starving
[1:28:55] for more of god amen
[1:29:00] we had
[1:29:01] such a beautiful experience when we
[1:29:03] knelt down and we called on the lord and
[1:29:07] perhaps
[1:29:09] you were immediately filled with the
[1:29:11] holy ghost i don't know your experience
[1:29:14] i'm telling you mine
[1:29:17] but
[1:29:19] when i
[1:29:20] knelt at that altar that night really i
[1:29:22] was laying on the ground
[1:29:25] and i knew that something had took took
[1:29:28] place had taken place
[1:29:31] but then there's this journey that we
[1:29:33] all are faced with
[1:29:36] where that it feels like that everything
[1:29:38] is a wilderness
[1:29:40] and
[1:29:42] we have to go back to our home see that
[1:29:44] was a camp meeting and we had to go back
[1:29:46] to our homes and to our home church and
[1:29:49] none of the fellowship of the believers
[1:29:51] was
[1:29:52] right around us
[1:29:54] the way it was at that camp where it was
[1:29:57] singing and worshiping every day and
[1:29:59] preaching every night and every morning
[1:30:01] and there was just a lovely atmosphere
[1:30:04] among the people and
[1:30:06] we went home
[1:30:08] we had to go back to the daily grind of
[1:30:10] life
[1:30:13] yes we were going to go to church on
[1:30:15] sunday and we were going to go to church
[1:30:17] on wednesday but we had to go to our
[1:30:19] jobs and we had to go
[1:30:22] maybe back to school or we had to face
[1:30:24] the things of life that were
[1:30:27] uh
[1:30:28] oppressive to us they were things that
[1:30:31] were just our natural everyday life
[1:30:34] and we didn't get the same
[1:30:36] infusion of the holy spirit
[1:30:40] on that daily basis that we were getting
[1:30:42] when we were at the camp meeting amen
[1:30:46] and so
[1:30:48] the devil used that as a wilderness
[1:30:53] and he tried to break me down he tries
[1:30:56] to break you down
[1:30:59] but god
[1:31:00] makes a way for us
[1:31:02] to have
[1:31:04] a filling of his spirit amen
[1:31:08] where that it doesn't
[1:31:10] have to be a one-time experience
[1:31:18] oh how we
[1:31:20] get things all misconstrued
[1:31:24] and
[1:31:25] we think that the baptism of the holy
[1:31:27] ghost
[1:31:28] is a one-time
[1:31:31] thing
[1:31:32] well the initial
[1:31:33] filling of the holy ghost
[1:31:36] that gets us
[1:31:38] started on the journey
[1:31:42] but things tend to leak out
[1:31:46] we're human
[1:31:47] amen we deal with the devil on a daily
[1:31:50] basis
[1:31:51] we deal with humanity on a daily basis
[1:31:54] we are
[1:31:56] we're
[1:31:57] fighting spirits that we can't see
[1:32:02] things that are hanging for you all over
[1:32:05] this region
[1:32:06] that maybe we don't fight down in
[1:32:09] alabama but you're fighting a different
[1:32:12] region of warfare
[1:32:14] then we're fighting down there
[1:32:19] pardon me
[1:32:20] we're fighting different battles
[1:32:25] but god put us in the region that he
[1:32:27] wanted us to be in
[1:32:30] just the same as he put you
[1:32:33] in a family
[1:32:35] that he knew
[1:32:37] would build you into the nature
[1:32:40] and the character that you needed
[1:32:44] for the spirits that hang over the
[1:32:46] region that you were called to
[1:32:49] you would be able to fight those battles
[1:32:55] you may say preacher i don't feel
[1:32:58] qualified to fight the battles that i am
[1:33:00] fighting well let me tell you you are
[1:33:03] qualified amen
[1:33:05] the holy spirit qualified you when he
[1:33:08] called you
[1:33:09] and it was something that we did not
[1:33:12] understand when we first called on the
[1:33:14] name of the lord it was something that
[1:33:17] we
[1:33:18] struggle with through time and and even
[1:33:22] into our adult years we don't really
[1:33:24] understand this warfare that we battle
[1:33:28] with from day to day
[1:33:31] so the spirit of god comes into our life
[1:33:34] and he
[1:33:35] comes with the measure that is needed
[1:33:39] for the moment
[1:33:43] you don't have currently
[1:33:45] everything that you are going to need
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:49] but you sitting here tonight
[1:33:52] testifies
[1:33:54] of the thought of the fact
[1:33:57] that
[1:33:59] god has brought you through every trial
[1:34:02] you've ever been through
[1:34:04] amen you may say well i'm in the middle
[1:34:06] of one right now but we can still
[1:34:10] testify right this moment that every
[1:34:12] trial that god has put you through he
[1:34:16] has brought you all the way through it
[1:34:19] amen and so if you're in one right now
[1:34:22] he is going to bring you through that
[1:34:24] one too
[1:34:26] because he gave you of his holy spirit
[1:34:29] so that you could go through that trial
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:33] it's not always easy it's not always
[1:34:35] pleasant
[1:34:41] we don't want to cuss in the pulpit but
[1:34:42] sometimes we just go through hell
[1:34:47] we go through things that feel like that
[1:34:49] we have gone to the depths of hell and
[1:34:52] back
[1:34:53] but
[1:34:55] david said yea
[1:34:57] though i walk through the valley
[1:35:01] of the shadow of death
[1:35:05] i will fear no evil
[1:35:07] now this valley of the shadow of death
[1:35:10] is not death itself
[1:35:15] and
[1:35:19] we know
[1:35:20] that many times
[1:35:23] we become scared
[1:35:25] by shadows
[1:35:31] anybody ever been jumpy
[1:35:35] when i was a child
[1:35:38] i was a scaredy cat
[1:35:41] i mean i was scared of everything
[1:35:48] go to a new house
[1:35:51] is that my sister's house last week
[1:35:56] never slept down there in that bedroom
[1:35:58] in the basement
[1:36:01] just
[1:36:02] different noises
[1:36:04] and you wonder is somebody breaking into
[1:36:06] the house
[1:36:08] what's going on
[1:36:11] so these things are still there to mess
[1:36:13] with our minds
[1:36:14] but shadows
[1:36:17] when when when the darkness begins to
[1:36:19] set in and in their shadows
[1:36:23] and then when darkness fully sets in and
[1:36:26] there's a little bit of light that
[1:36:28] shines and it creates a shadow
[1:36:32] and we can't see what's in that shadow
[1:36:35] and our mind makes up all kinds of
[1:36:39] imaginations of what's in that shadow or
[1:36:43] what's lurking behind that shadow and
[1:36:46] our imagination goes wild
[1:36:53] and this is exactly what the enemy tries
[1:36:56] to do with us when god takes us through
[1:37:00] a trial there is the valley of the
[1:37:02] shadow of death and there are shadows
[1:37:05] everywhere and the enemy wants our
[1:37:08] imagination
[1:37:09] to go so wild that we start making up
[1:37:13] stories in our mind of what we're about
[1:37:16] to face when all it is is a shadow
[1:37:21] amen just a shadow
[1:37:24] there's nothing there but the enemy uses
[1:37:28] it
[1:37:28] to try to make our minds go crazy and
[1:37:34] not concentrate on the word of god and
[1:37:36] this shadow keeps us all in a stir
[1:37:40] but it's nothing
[1:37:42] but a shadow
[1:37:45] but
[1:37:46] somewhere there's light amen
[1:37:50] somewhere there's light
[1:37:53] that's causing a shadow
[1:37:57] now you could make this room just as
[1:37:59] dark as you possibly could
[1:38:03] and that little exit sign back there
[1:38:05] with that little 5 watt bulb in it
[1:38:09] that's all that's in that exit light is
[1:38:12] 5 watt bulb
[1:38:15] it's like the ones at our church
[1:38:18] that sign would be enough if this room
[1:38:21] was pitched into blackness that exit
[1:38:24] sign would be enough to cast some light
[1:38:27] so that we could find our way to get out
[1:38:30] that door
[1:38:31] but because
[1:38:33] that that light is so small
[1:38:36] it would begin to create shadows all
[1:38:40] over this room
[1:38:44] and the further that you would get from
[1:38:46] that light
[1:38:49] the less light there would be
[1:38:52] but it would still create shadows and
[1:38:55] that is exactly how the enemy works with
[1:38:58] our imagination
[1:39:00] to cause us to fear
[1:39:03] but fear not little bride
[1:39:06] there is a man in here that can turn on
[1:39:09] the light
[1:39:11] and by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:16] by the infilling of the holy ghost
[1:39:19] there is a light that comes in the
[1:39:22] believer that starts dispelling the
[1:39:25] shadows that are around us
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:32] now my experience
[1:39:35] went on and continues on
[1:39:38] but i want to give you the rest of the
[1:39:40] story
[1:39:42] because
[1:39:44] i fought my way
[1:39:46] to get what i've got
[1:39:49] and friends
[1:39:51] if you haven't fought your way to get
[1:39:54] what you've got
[1:39:56] i would encourage you
[1:39:58] to be on guard
[1:40:01] because
[1:40:02] the enemy
[1:40:04] is going to try to steal what you got
[1:40:08] even for a seasoned believer
[1:40:12] the enemy wants to try to steal what you
[1:40:15] have amen
[1:40:18] so you've got to be on guard at all
[1:40:19] times
[1:40:22] i didn't understand
[1:40:27] concerning
[1:40:31] the
[1:40:32] when the
[1:40:34] people in the upper room
[1:40:37] received the holy ghost
[1:40:40] and cloven tongues of fire set down upon
[1:40:44] them
[1:40:45] and they staggered like drunk
[1:40:48] men i've had that experience to stagger
[1:40:51] like a drunk man
[1:40:53] with the power of the holy ghost
[1:40:58] and when they went out into the streets
[1:41:01] they were speaking in another language
[1:41:05] they began to speak in different tongues
[1:41:07] and they were able to communicate with
[1:41:09] some of the people that were there from
[1:41:11] other nations that didn't understand
[1:41:14] their language
[1:41:18] they spoke with other tongues and i
[1:41:20] believe that it is a gifting of the holy
[1:41:23] spirit that goes along it's a part of
[1:41:26] the gift of the holy ghost that is given
[1:41:29] to the end time body of christ it is not
[1:41:33] the initial evidence of the holy ghost
[1:41:36] it is not the finish hall of the holy
[1:41:38] ghost but it is a part of the holy ghost
[1:41:42] it is a part of the gifting of god
[1:41:46] that he gave to his people on the day of
[1:41:49] pentecost and god is still pouring it
[1:41:52] out on the believer in the end time
[1:41:56] amen if you've never experienced it i
[1:42:00] encourage you to ask the lord
[1:42:03] if he will
[1:42:04] bless you
[1:42:06] with that
[1:42:07] amen but i fought against it for many
[1:42:09] years
[1:42:10] ignorantly fought against it stupidly
[1:42:14] fought against it
[1:42:16] not realizing how much that it was a
[1:42:19] benefit
[1:42:20] to a believer amen
[1:42:24] but one day
[1:42:26] i was praying
[1:42:28] and i started hearing another language
[1:42:30] in my mind in my spirit however you want
[1:42:32] to say it
[1:42:34] i could hear it i could hear it i could
[1:42:36] hear it i could hear it and i didn't
[1:42:37] know what to do about it
[1:42:39] because i did not want to presume
[1:42:41] anything
[1:42:42] but i could hear it
[1:42:46] and so i went to
[1:42:48] brother shelley
[1:42:50] i knew that he was a tongue talker
[1:42:53] i knew that that's the way that the lord
[1:42:55] birthed him amen
[1:42:56] i knew that's why what from the age of
[1:42:59] seven years old that's how that he had
[1:43:02] he came in and and god blessed him that
[1:43:05] way so i went to him and i said what
[1:43:07] should i do about that
[1:43:08] i can hear these things in my mind i can
[1:43:11] what should i do about it he says well
[1:43:14] in your private time when you're alone
[1:43:16] he says just speak out what you're
[1:43:18] hearing
[1:43:19] i said okay that's exactly what i'll do
[1:43:22] so i began in my private prayer time
[1:43:24] this went on for about two weeks
[1:43:26] in my private prayer time i just began
[1:43:29] to speak out what i was hearing
[1:43:31] just
[1:43:33] i didn't know what i was saying
[1:43:35] i just was trying to feel my way through
[1:43:39] because i wanted that experience i knew
[1:43:42] i had the holy ghost i knew that i had
[1:43:45] been called to preach the gospel at i
[1:43:48] think i was about 21 years old when i
[1:43:50] preached the first time 52 years old now
[1:43:53] i started preaching and i knew that i
[1:43:56] had the holy ghost but i wanted more of
[1:43:58] god i wanted all that god had for me i
[1:44:00] didn't want to stop
[1:44:02] you know these people they they get to
[1:44:04] speaking in tongues part and they think
[1:44:06] that's the all of it oh friends they're
[1:44:09] so much more than that
[1:44:13] and then you have preachers that you
[1:44:15] know you get somebody that speaks in
[1:44:17] tongues and then they throw out this
[1:44:19] quote why settle for that when the
[1:44:22] pentecostal skies are full of the real
[1:44:26] and you see i had this this mindset
[1:44:30] it was a false mindset it was one that i
[1:44:33] created maybe those preachers didn't
[1:44:35] have that particular thought in mind
[1:44:38] when they were saying it i don't know i
[1:44:41] can't judge their motives i can't judge
[1:44:43] their character but i can tell you what
[1:44:46] i felt in my own self that they were
[1:44:48] saying why bother with that
[1:44:51] it's all the word the word the word
[1:44:54] well friends
[1:44:57] a part of the word is
[1:44:59] that on the day of pentecost there was a
[1:45:02] rushing mighty wind and there was cloven
[1:45:05] tongues that came down upon them and
[1:45:08] they staggered like drunk men and they
[1:45:11] went out into the streets and brother
[1:45:13] branham said that they did that they
[1:45:15] were so full of god that they didn't
[1:45:18] they weren't able to speak in their own
[1:45:20] native tongue that god had to give them
[1:45:22] a new heavenly tongue
[1:45:24] they went out into the streets and began
[1:45:26] to speak in other tongues that's the
[1:45:29] word you look through the book of acts
[1:45:31] how many times when they received the
[1:45:33] baptism of the holy ghost that they
[1:45:35] spoke in other tongues they spoke in
[1:45:38] another language and so i began to
[1:45:40] recognize this is something for me
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:48] it is not
[1:45:50] what god gave me to let me know that i
[1:45:53] had the holy ghost but it is something
[1:45:56] that god came to me
[1:45:58] and i was feeling my way through it
[1:46:02] because i wasn't satisfied just to hear
[1:46:05] it in my head
[1:46:06] amen i wanted the experience in full so
[1:46:10] for about two weeks
[1:46:12] for about two weeks i would in my
[1:46:15] private prayer time i would just start
[1:46:17] hearing that and i would just
[1:46:19] start
[1:46:21] trying to express it with my voice
[1:46:25] about two weeks later
[1:46:27] on a sunday night
[1:46:30] power of god came down in
[1:46:33] new hope revival center in columbus
[1:46:35] georgia
[1:46:36] brother shelley laid his hands on me
[1:46:39] and that push of the holy ghost came
[1:46:42] down in such a
[1:46:43] magnitude and i went from one side of
[1:46:46] the building to the other side of the
[1:46:47] building and that speaking in tongues
[1:46:50] that power of the holy ghost was coming
[1:46:52] out of me and brother shelley said get
[1:46:55] full of it let it just fill you up let
[1:46:57] it fill you up and he said just get all
[1:47:00] splash around in it a while he said
[1:47:03] because you don't want the devil to be
[1:47:05] able to steal it from you tomorrow
[1:47:07] that's good well
[1:47:09] i just listened to his advice
[1:47:12] and i was a wild man that night
[1:47:16] and the devil ain't been able to steal
[1:47:18] it from me from 1998 till now
[1:47:22] the holy ghost came in such a wave
[1:47:25] and what i found out friends see
[1:47:27] we're not going to major on a minor
[1:47:31] so to speak
[1:47:32] but
[1:47:34] speaking in tongues
[1:47:36] was a part of what they received on the
[1:47:39] day of pentecost
[1:47:41] and there have been many who have tried
[1:47:43] to say it wasn't necessary in our day
[1:47:46] but friends if you ever experience it
[1:47:50] and and you realize that it's not just a
[1:47:54] gift for you to be able to tout or pat
[1:47:58] yourself on the shoulder or something
[1:48:00] and say i've spoken in tongues no it is
[1:48:03] a gifting of god that he places inside
[1:48:06] of a believer because he wants to use it
[1:48:10] as a tool to defeat the devil in your
[1:48:13] life
[1:48:14] and you may say how is it that that
[1:48:17] it's going to defeat the devil in your
[1:48:20] life well you see not all tongues has to
[1:48:23] have an interpretation
[1:48:27] there is a gift of tongues that operates
[1:48:30] in the church that is a gift that has to
[1:48:33] have an interpretation otherwise it's
[1:48:36] not edifying anybody it's not going to
[1:48:39] help anybody but there is a gift of the
[1:48:42] holy ghost that he gives to the believer
[1:48:45] that we
[1:48:46] we speak in a language that he is making
[1:48:50] intercession on our behalf
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:55] amen perhaps
[1:49:03] you are going through a trial
[1:49:08] and perhaps
[1:49:10] that trial is of such a nature
[1:49:13] that you don't feel like that you can
[1:49:15] tell anybody about what you're going
[1:49:17] through
[1:49:19] and perhaps
[1:49:22] you would go to somebody
[1:49:24] that god has given that gift to
[1:49:27] and you would say pray for me and that's
[1:49:30] all you would say
[1:49:34] now
[1:49:35] amen
[1:49:36] i can
[1:49:38] look at you
[1:49:40] over the past couple of weeks and
[1:49:43] realize that you've been going through a
[1:49:45] deep dark trial and i can make some
[1:49:48] observations and i can make some
[1:49:51] assumptions and i can have some thoughts
[1:49:55] in my mind of what kind of a valley that
[1:49:58] you're going through
[1:50:00] and i can pray in my own native tongue
[1:50:03] and i can and i can tell the lord what i
[1:50:06] think that you might need
[1:50:09] or what might serve you better is for me
[1:50:13] to get in the spirit amen
[1:50:16] and let the holy ghost intercede through
[1:50:18] me amen
[1:50:20] and let him do the interceding on your
[1:50:23] behalf because the holy ghost knows a
[1:50:26] whole lot more about what you're going
[1:50:28] through than i do
[1:50:30] and if i can let him pray through me
[1:50:34] and he can express that then that
[1:50:38] intercession is going to do so much more
[1:50:40] for you
[1:50:42] than if i pray my natural thoughts of
[1:50:44] what i've observed
[1:50:46] of what i've thought
[1:50:48] of what i think that you're going
[1:50:50] through
[1:50:51] all of that
[1:50:53] could be good
[1:50:55] could be right
[1:50:57] but if the holy ghost intercedes amen
[1:51:01] if he does the interceding
[1:51:03] then i believe that the need can be met
[1:51:06] so much more abundantly amen
[1:51:09] than if now
[1:51:11] again
[1:51:13] this is not
[1:51:15] to major on this gifting
[1:51:18] it is just a part
[1:51:20] of the things the the the
[1:51:23] gifts of the holy ghost that he places
[1:51:26] in our life to be able to guide us
[1:51:29] through this maze of life that we have
[1:51:33] been uh given here on the earth again
[1:51:36] every one of us has a different maze
[1:51:40] that we're going through
[1:51:41] our lives have intersected now
[1:51:45] and and they've intersected in such a
[1:51:47] way that
[1:51:49] god must have saw that there was
[1:51:51] something in me
[1:51:53] that he wanted to intersect with your
[1:51:56] life and your life with me
[1:51:58] because he is offently joining the body
[1:52:02] of christ together in such a way now the
[1:52:06] battles that you face the upbringing
[1:52:08] that you had the the
[1:52:10] the the family unit that you had or
[1:52:13] didn't have all of that stuff that
[1:52:16] constructed your life up till now and
[1:52:19] what constructed my life up till now
[1:52:23] this is now a junction of time
[1:52:28] this is a junction of time that god has
[1:52:31] chosen to intersect our lives for
[1:52:34] whatever purposes only eternity will
[1:52:38] tell but there must be something that
[1:52:41] god wants to do among us at this
[1:52:45] junction of time that he would bring us
[1:52:48] together on this saturday night when it
[1:52:51] is cold outside and nobody really wants
[1:52:54] to go outside because it is cold but yet
[1:52:58] here we are gathered together in the
[1:53:01] presence of the lord amen because he has
[1:53:04] something that he wants to put inside of
[1:53:07] us he has something that he wants to
[1:53:09] birth in us
[1:53:11] and
[1:53:13] it may not always look like what we
[1:53:16] think it would look like
[1:53:18] it's true
[1:53:19] amen
[1:53:25] light is an interesting thing
[1:53:31] jesus said
[1:53:34] you are the light of the world
[1:53:36] matthew chapter 5.
[1:53:40] john i believe chapter 8
[1:53:43] he said
[1:53:45] while i am in the world
[1:53:48] i am the light of the world
[1:53:50] that was john's record of
[1:53:54] what jesus said
[1:53:56] jesus said while i am in this world i am
[1:53:59] the light of the world
[1:54:01] but then he
[1:54:02] had a record in the book of matthew you
[1:54:05] are the light of the world and
[1:54:08] he
[1:54:10] instructed us
[1:54:12] that
[1:54:15] we
[1:54:17] because of him we can carry light
[1:54:21] we have the ability to carry life
[1:54:25] we are not creatures of darkness
[1:54:28] men have loved darkness
[1:54:31] rather than light
[1:54:33] because their deeds are evil
[1:54:37] we see darkness settling in on the earth
[1:54:41] in such a way that we begin to wonder
[1:54:45] how soon will be the coming of the lord
[1:54:48] how soon will the lord come
[1:54:51] can the earth take much more darkness
[1:54:57] we see evil pressing in on every side
[1:55:00] amen
[1:55:02] every
[1:55:02] way we see
[1:55:06] sodom
[1:55:07] conditions
[1:55:10] but yet
[1:55:12] i have said this before
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:15] we say that we live in a sodom condition
[1:55:18] and yes we see
[1:55:20] that the spirit of sodom
[1:55:23] is gaining ground in the earth
[1:55:27] but i would remind you
[1:55:30] that when the angels went to sodom when
[1:55:33] the angels met abraham
[1:55:36] and those two angels went to sodom
[1:55:39] that the spirit was so prevalent in
[1:55:43] sodom
[1:55:44] that they were busting the doors down to
[1:55:47] get to the angels
[1:55:50] and we've not yet seen them busting the
[1:55:52] doors down
[1:55:55] that spirit is
[1:55:57] most likely going to get stronger amen
[1:56:00] yes sir
[1:56:02] the transgender idea it's going to get
[1:56:05] stronger
[1:56:07] the the
[1:56:08] the the
[1:56:09] gay and lesbian agenda it is going to
[1:56:12] get stronger it's they're going to try
[1:56:15] to infiltrate every part of our life but
[1:56:19] it is the responsibility
[1:56:21] of the believer
[1:56:23] to carry the light amen
[1:56:26] men have loved darkness
[1:56:29] rather than light
[1:56:30] because their deeds are evil
[1:56:34] but a
[1:56:35] a city
[1:56:38] that is set on a hill
[1:56:41] cannot be heard that's right
[1:56:43] amen and god did not put his light in
[1:56:46] you
[1:56:48] for you to go hide in the shadow
[1:56:53] god did not put his light in you
[1:56:56] for you to run away
[1:57:00] and say oh lord
[1:57:02] why don't you just take the bride out of
[1:57:04] here no
[1:57:07] now this has been our attitude friends
[1:57:09] amen
[1:57:10] god why don't you just rapture us out of
[1:57:13] here
[1:57:17] we're not ready
[1:57:19] oh we're ready
[1:57:21] but we're not ready
[1:57:25] everything that has been prophesied to
[1:57:27] us
[1:57:30] must be fulfilled
[1:57:32] amen
[1:57:34] and that includes the bride of jesus
[1:57:37] christ coming to her maturity amen
[1:57:40] and as long as the bride is fighting
[1:57:43] with one another
[1:57:46] and we're wrestling flesh and blood
[1:57:49] and we're we're hiding our sin in the
[1:57:53] darkness and in the shadows as long as
[1:57:56] all of that is going on there cannot be
[1:57:59] a rapture of the bride of jesus christ
[1:58:03] amen but there is coming something
[1:58:07] it is pressing in on us even as we speak
[1:58:11] it is pressing in on us and it is going
[1:58:14] to squeeze us into our maturity amen
[1:58:19] when jesus after after he was baptized
[1:58:24] and he went into the wilderness
[1:58:26] he went through a time where that he
[1:58:29] fought the devil he fought the devil he
[1:58:31] fought the devil and he overcame him
[1:58:35] every time by the word amen amen amen
[1:58:39] amen amen
[1:58:40] i wonder
[1:58:43] when jesus was fighting the enemy
[1:58:48] i wonder
[1:58:51] if he felt
[1:58:53] anything
[1:58:55] when he spoke the word to the devil
[1:58:59] i wonder
[1:59:01] if he felt elated by speaking the word
[1:59:11] he was in a human body
[1:59:15] amen
[1:59:16] he was in all manner amen tempted yes
[1:59:20] sir as we amen now you watch
[1:59:23] when
[1:59:24] when he was driven into the wilderness
[1:59:28] he was fasting and he was hungry
[1:59:32] what was the first thing the devil did
[1:59:36] he hit him in the flesh
[1:59:40] if you're who you say you are
[1:59:44] why don't you turn these stones into
[1:59:47] bread
[1:59:50] but i'm just going to let you know
[1:59:53] when jesus got through telling the devil
[1:59:56] man cannot live by bread alone but by
[1:59:59] every word that proceeds out of the
[2:00:00] mouth of god
[2:00:02] he was probably still just as hungry as
[2:00:04] he was before he said that amen
[2:00:10] amen amen
[2:00:14] did he feel any different
[2:00:17] i don't know
[2:00:20] but the word
[2:00:22] was put on the enemy amen amen but the
[2:00:24] enemy hit him first in the flesh
[2:00:29] then
[2:00:32] as he works on us he worked on jesus
[2:00:35] there in the wilderness
[2:00:39] all right he was hungry
[2:00:42] anybody ever fast
[2:00:46] done some fasting my life
[2:00:50] and i would dare say that brother brooks
[2:00:52] has probably done something much more
[2:00:55] stringent than i have ever done
[2:00:58] i have fasted for a 21 day period but i
[2:01:02] was drinking a protein shake every day
[2:01:05] because i was in the face of message
[2:01:07] preachers who was reminding me that said
[2:01:10] brother branham said three days was
[2:01:11] enough
[2:01:13] i understood that i felt the call to do
[2:01:15] 21 days i was not abusing my body my
[2:01:19] teeth were not falling out of my head i
[2:01:21] was getting some nutrition but i felt
[2:01:24] the call to do the 21 days
[2:01:27] but as you go into these days
[2:01:30] and you are getting hungry
[2:01:33] even though i was drinking a shake i was
[2:01:36] still hungry
[2:01:38] and then you get on over into seven 10
[2:01:40] days where you haven't chewed anything
[2:01:43] for 10 days and the devil starts playing
[2:01:46] with your mind
[2:01:49] and so that's what he was doing with
[2:01:51] jesus
[2:01:52] and so he takes him up to this high
[2:01:54] pinnacle of the of the temple and he
[2:01:56] says why don't you just commit suicide
[2:01:59] that's right
[2:02:02] why don't you just jump off the word
[2:02:05] says the the word says that he'll give
[2:02:08] his angels charge over you lest you dash
[2:02:11] your foot against the stone but he
[2:02:13] wanted jesus to kill himself because he
[2:02:16] didn't want him on the earth anymore
[2:02:19] but you see you are a part of the lord
[2:02:22] jesus christ amen
[2:02:24] and the enemy wants to kill you he wants
[2:02:27] to thwart your journey he wants to stop
[2:02:31] you from what god has called you to amen
[2:02:35] and he will mess with your mind and he
[2:02:38] will drive you to the same place that he
[2:02:41] did jesus where that you might take
[2:02:44] pills where you might jump off of a
[2:02:46] building you might jump off of a bridge
[2:02:49] you may take a gun and shoot yourself in
[2:02:51] the head he doesn't care how you do it
[2:02:54] he just wants you to take your own life
[2:02:56] and wreck your destiny
[2:02:59] put the word on him
[2:03:01] devil
[2:03:02] the holy spirit is here to keep me
[2:03:06] all the way through every one of these
[2:03:08] trials amen
[2:03:11] amen
[2:03:12] every one of them amen
[2:03:16] did jesus feel any differently
[2:03:18] after he had that battle
[2:03:21] i don't know
[2:03:23] was he still hungry
[2:03:25] i suspect he was
[2:03:26] he was still fasting
[2:03:28] he was still in the wilderness he was
[2:03:30] still in the journey he was in the trial
[2:03:33] he was in the heat of the battle the
[2:03:35] devil was coming to him
[2:03:37] because he was in a human flesh and he
[2:03:39] was fighting these same temptations and
[2:03:42] things that we face on a daily basis and
[2:03:45] jesus was going through the same thing
[2:03:47] so now the devil has to come up with a
[2:03:50] different tactic
[2:03:52] i didn't it didn't work for me to get
[2:03:54] him to quit
[2:03:56] so let me try something else
[2:03:59] leads him up to a high place
[2:04:01] says all of these kingdoms i'll give to
[2:04:04] you
[2:04:05] if you'll just bow down and worship me
[2:04:10] what was he working on now
[2:04:12] pride
[2:04:14] pride
[2:04:15] if you're not going to
[2:04:18] get out of my way
[2:04:19] let me see if i can't build you up in
[2:04:22] pride
[2:04:25] you see
[2:04:27] the devil
[2:04:30] tried once upon a time to usurp
[2:04:33] authority
[2:04:34] in heavenly places
[2:04:36] now i just want you to think about the
[2:04:38] power and the authority that the devil
[2:04:41] had when he was in the heavenly place
[2:04:46] and he was
[2:04:49] really he was
[2:04:50] right hand man to god
[2:04:55] he was one of those powerful angels with
[2:04:58] gabriel and michael
[2:05:01] he was music director we'll say there
[2:05:04] was something about him
[2:05:06] but he was lifted up in pride and in
[2:05:09] isaiah 14 you can read about all of the
[2:05:12] things that he tried to do to build
[2:05:15] himself up build himself up build
[2:05:18] himself up till finally he wanted to
[2:05:22] be above
[2:05:24] our creator
[2:05:27] and he created a rebellion in such a way
[2:05:30] that god finally said enough is enough
[2:05:33] and put him out
[2:05:36] when jesus
[2:05:38] was tempted in the wilderness
[2:05:41] the devil again was trying to find a way
[2:05:46] to gain authority
[2:05:49] to gain some access
[2:05:53] to
[2:05:54] uh
[2:05:55] use
[2:05:57] humanity for his purposes just as he did
[2:06:00] in the garden
[2:06:01] he was trying to use humanity for his
[2:06:03] purposes and so he's trying to get jesus
[2:06:06] lifted up in pride
[2:06:10] all of this
[2:06:12] is to be a
[2:06:14] shadow and a type for us to understand
[2:06:16] that the enemy is going to come to us
[2:06:19] in the same kind of ways he's going to
[2:06:21] come at our flesh he's going to come at
[2:06:23] our soul he's going to come in our
[2:06:24] spirit he's going to do all kinds of
[2:06:26] things to try to get us all out of sorts
[2:06:29] with life to and and if if he can't get
[2:06:32] you to live in the valley of the shadow
[2:06:35] of death he's going to try to get you
[2:06:37] lifted up in pride to try to let you be
[2:06:41] somebody that
[2:06:43] is always
[2:06:48] i'm somebody
[2:06:57] if he can't get you to be a nobody
[2:07:00] he'll try to make you think you're
[2:07:02] somebody
[2:07:07] and the fact is i'm somebody and nobody
[2:07:09] all at the same time
[2:07:13] but i'm not going to let him
[2:07:17] put a name on who i am amen and you
[2:07:21] can't let him put a name on who you are
[2:07:24] you have got to allow the holy spirit
[2:07:28] day by day by day to work on you
[2:07:32] and and and by his holy spirit work in
[2:07:36] you
[2:07:36] and become the light that he has called
[2:07:39] you to be
[2:07:40] he has called you to be a bearer of the
[2:07:44] light and he called you to be a bearer
[2:07:47] of the light because he knew that there
[2:07:49] would be plenty of darkness in the world
[2:07:52] and he came
[2:07:54] he's he came into your life for you
[2:07:59] to keep a little bit of light
[2:08:02] in this earth amen
[2:08:05] now the bible is coming to a close this
[2:08:08] did not go the way i thought it was
[2:08:11] praise god
[2:08:13] but the bible tells us in luke
[2:08:16] let's turn there and read it luke
[2:08:18] chapter 11.
[2:08:24] verse 33 no man
[2:08:27] when he hath lighted a candle
[2:08:30] putteth it
[2:08:31] in a secret place
[2:08:34] neither under a bushel
[2:08:36] but on a candlestick that they which
[2:08:39] come in
[2:08:40] may see the light
[2:08:43] the light of the body
[2:08:46] is the eye
[2:08:48] therefore
[2:08:49] when thine eye is single
[2:08:51] thy whole body is also full of light
[2:08:56] but when thine eye is evil
[2:08:58] thy body also is full of darkness
[2:09:03] take heed therefore that the light
[2:09:07] which is in thee
[2:09:09] be not darkness
[2:09:12] if thy whole body therefore be full of
[2:09:15] light having no part dark
[2:09:17] the hole shall be full of light as when
[2:09:19] the bright shining of a candle
[2:09:22] doth give the light
[2:09:24] back to 35 take heed therefore
[2:09:28] that the light which is in thee
[2:09:31] be not darkened
[2:09:33] or darkness
[2:09:35] or shadowed
[2:09:37] or obscure
[2:09:40] god chose to put his light in you
[2:09:44] so that it could shine amen
[2:09:47] this little light of mine
[2:09:50] i'm going to let it shine
[2:09:54] but there are always things in
[2:09:56] that the enemy comes at you with
[2:10:00] to try to
[2:10:02] put out your light
[2:10:06] i would like to report to you
[2:10:09] tonight
[2:10:11] that the enemy
[2:10:12] cannot put out your life
[2:10:16] he cannot
[2:10:18] but he will come at you with trials
[2:10:22] he will come at you with temptations
[2:10:25] he will come at you with family scuffles
[2:10:28] he will come at you with church scuffles
[2:10:30] he will come at you with job scuffles
[2:10:33] he will come after you with mind battles
[2:10:35] of all sorts
[2:10:36] because it is his
[2:10:38] desire
[2:10:40] to obscure
[2:10:41] your light
[2:10:45] now the light is still there is it not
[2:10:48] but it has become obscured
[2:10:52] it has become lessened
[2:10:55] because we have allowed the enemy to
[2:10:58] come
[2:10:59] and use something
[2:11:02] or someone
[2:11:04] to put a bushel over our light
[2:11:07] to do something to obscure our light
[2:11:13] now we read in ezekiel and we also read
[2:11:15] in the book of revelation that there is
[2:11:17] a aura
[2:11:18] a light
[2:11:20] around the throne
[2:11:22] and there is a perfect light in the
[2:11:24] presence of god remember when when
[2:11:28] the the humans were put in the garden of
[2:11:30] eden they were clothed with the light of
[2:11:33] god they had clothing the glory of god
[2:11:36] but when they tasted of the tree of the
[2:11:39] knowledge of good and evil
[2:11:42] there they lost their covering
[2:11:46] their light became obscured we'll say
[2:11:48] they no longer had see but god wanted
[2:11:52] once us by the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:11:56] he wants our light to shine brightly
[2:11:58] before man that they may see our good
[2:12:00] works and glorify god which is in heaven
[2:12:03] but we allow all kinds of things to
[2:12:05] obscure our light
[2:12:08] and to steal the glory of god out of our
[2:12:10] lives
[2:12:11] but he calls us back to the baptism of
[2:12:14] the holy ghost back to a refilling of
[2:12:16] the holy spirit
[2:12:18] and if i could encourage you in anything
[2:12:20] tonight that would be my encouragement
[2:12:22] to you if you've never received the
[2:12:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:12:26] i would encourage you to lay before the
[2:12:29] lord and perhaps you have
[2:12:31] responsibilities that that may cause you
[2:12:34] to have to get up i don't know but just
[2:12:36] stay before the lord and you constantly
[2:12:39] ask him lord i want you to fill me so
[2:12:42] full of the holy spirit till that i
[2:12:45] never again doubt amen that i have the
[2:12:48] holy ghost
[2:12:49] friends
[2:12:50] i've had a lot of battles in my life
[2:12:53] i've faced the devil many a times but
[2:12:55] the devil has never been able to talk me
[2:12:58] out of the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:13:00] he's never been able to make me doubt
[2:13:03] that the lord gave me the infilling of
[2:13:06] the spirit does it mean that i've not
[2:13:08] fought the devil i have does it mean
[2:13:11] i've not gone through discouraging times
[2:13:13] in my life where i wanted to just throw
[2:13:16] up my hands and say i quit of course
[2:13:18] there have been but there was still
[2:13:20] something on the inside of me that i
[2:13:24] knew that i knew that i knew
[2:13:27] that i knew no matter how much
[2:13:29] discouragement even even if i did
[2:13:32] something that displeased the lord you
[2:13:35] know how the enemy does he comes and
[2:13:37] says you don't have the holy ghost why
[2:13:39] you're not even saved
[2:13:42] shut up devil
[2:13:44] shut up
[2:13:46] i know in whom i have believed and i'm
[2:13:49] persuaded that he's able to keep me
[2:13:53] all the way to the day of his appearing
[2:13:56] he that began that good work in me is
[2:14:00] the same one that's going to perform it
[2:14:02] all the way to the day of jesus christ
[2:14:06] amen
[2:14:07] amen the world didn't give it to me
[2:14:10] and the world can't take it away
[2:14:14] they can't they don't have the ability
[2:14:16] to take it away the devil doesn't have
[2:14:18] the ability to take it away from me
[2:14:22] does that mean that i've never kind of
[2:14:24] released it into his hands
[2:14:27] there have been those times
[2:14:29] but by the grace of god i stand before
[2:14:31] you tonight and give you the testimony
[2:14:34] that i have yanked it back
[2:14:36] i have yanked it back time and again and
[2:14:39] i said oh no you know he can only go so
[2:14:42] far
[2:14:44] he can only go so far
[2:14:46] and i've yanked it back and said oh no
[2:14:48] you don't oh no you don't
[2:14:50] i know the experience that i had with
[2:14:52] the lord jesus christ and i know that he
[2:14:55] is able to keep me
[2:14:58] to the day of jesus christ he is able to
[2:15:00] sustain me
[2:15:02] as things press in and get harder and
[2:15:05] harder and harder he'll give me more
[2:15:08] grace and more grace and we're going to
[2:15:10] have to keep coming back
[2:15:12] to the lord jesus christ musicians come

[2:30:20] [Applause]
[2:30:25] reach out and just
[2:30:37] truly the lord is blessed
[2:30:40] i trust everybody tonight
[2:30:43] i'll receive something from the lord
[2:30:46] one thing for certain
[2:30:48] by just listening to the message
[2:30:52] god's provided a place of worship for
[2:30:55] this day
[2:30:56] in 1964
[2:31:00] the prophet god tells us that you cry
[2:31:02] out
[2:31:04] until you get what you want
[2:31:06] he said that's god provided way for this
[2:31:10] day
[2:31:11] i don't care what the teachers have told
[2:31:13] you
[2:31:15] god has told us
[2:31:17] this is how you get what you need
[2:31:20] it may come in a various way
[2:31:23] but when you do get what you need
[2:31:26] you'll come up in peace
[2:31:28] like the brother said you come up in a
[2:31:30] way
[2:31:31] that satan can never take it from it
[2:31:34] so i i just thank god because i know
[2:31:37] that throughout all the trials i've ever
[2:31:39] gone through
[2:31:40] there's always a place
[2:31:42] satan can't touch
[2:31:44] and i thank god for the experience of
[2:31:48] the holy spirit
[2:31:50] i'm kind of greedy
[2:31:51] i want more
[2:31:54] i i won't stop
[2:31:56] i want baptism after baptism at the
[2:31:59] baptism at the baptism until i see the
[2:32:01] perfection of god living in me
[2:32:05] and for a person who don't want it
[2:32:09] i don't know what to say
[2:32:12] but for those of us who want it
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:15] we're like jacob
[2:32:17] if we got a wrestle all night with the
[2:32:20] angels
[2:32:21] we're going to get our blessings
[2:32:23] i was blessed tonight
[2:32:26] we thank you brother
[2:32:27] [Music]
[2:32:28] i like when god shifts sermons
[2:32:34] that's when you really get my attention
[2:32:36] for sure because i know somebody's being
[2:32:39] fed somebody's being touched
[2:32:42] and somebody is getting an understanding
[2:32:44] of things they never had understanding
[2:32:46] of
[2:32:48] and i appreciate the brother because in
[2:32:50] the message so many people are afraid to
[2:32:52] talk on these subjects
[2:32:54] on this subject in particular
[2:32:56] because they're afraid of it
[2:32:58] many of them don't understand it
[2:33:01] and most of them don't know what they're
[2:33:02] talking about
[2:33:04] and so they stay away from it and they
[2:33:06] give you a different uh
[2:33:08] idea of the way it should be
[2:33:11] but i look at the way
[2:33:14] animals have babies
[2:33:16] cows
[2:33:17] dogs
[2:33:18] even humans
[2:33:20] brother adam said every birth is a mess
[2:33:23] there's no way of getting around it
[2:33:25] people
[2:33:26] you can't be educated into it
[2:33:29] it's not psychology
[2:33:32] it's when god comes in
[2:33:34] when he does the work you'll know he's
[2:33:36] done the work
[2:33:38] because he never leaves anything undone
[2:33:41] so i just thank god for the grace of god
[2:33:43] i
[2:33:44] [Music]
[2:33:46] how can i say it it's just the lord has
[2:33:48] touched me tonight in such a special way
[2:33:50] i've been
[2:33:51] really going through some
[2:33:53] hard times
[2:33:55] but i thank god for every moment of it
[2:33:58] if what he could do for me tonight what
[2:34:00] he did for me tonight
[2:34:02] i i don't mind
[2:34:06] i thank god for his amazing grace as our
[2:34:08] song to come
[2:34:09] i trust everyone who's been blessed
[2:34:11] anybody desire prayer particularly
