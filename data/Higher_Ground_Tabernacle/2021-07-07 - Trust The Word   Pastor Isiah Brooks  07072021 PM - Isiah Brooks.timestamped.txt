[44:48] oh
[44:51] power just now and baptize
[44:54] everyone thank god for his grace and his
[44:57] mercy
[44:59] we thank god for being so good to us it
[45:02] is a blessing
[45:03] it's a privilege to be in the house of
[45:05] the lord
[45:06] today or tonight there are many
[45:10] who did not wake up this morning
[45:13] but god was gracious enough to
[45:16] wake us up and you know by the grace of
[45:19] god as long as
[45:20] [Music]
[45:22] i'm here i want to do whatever god wants
[45:27] me to do we're just going to get right
[45:29] into the word of the lord
[45:31] thank god for the song service and those
[45:34] who
[45:35] did enter in and pray that god continue
[45:38] to bless you by the grace of god
[45:40] i had so many thoughts on my mind and
[45:42] things in my heart
[45:44] there was one message that i thought i
[45:46] would be preaching right now but
[45:48] it seems like that's the message that i
[45:50] have prepared
[45:51] is not what god would have me to preach
[45:54] of course i've got to
[45:56] maybe prepare myself even more so with
[45:59] that
[46:00] but psalms 18 is where we're coming from
[46:02] tonight
[46:03] psalms 18.
[46:09] i guess the thing that quest i have a
[46:11] question in my mind about
[46:14] is uh thought of wondering whether
[46:17] people realize
[46:18] uh what god is doing with us
[46:22] you know he did not call us to a
[46:25] religion or to be some kind of a
[46:28] group of a large or anything like that
[46:30] but there's a greater work that is
[46:32] happening among the people of god
[46:35] and the very thought that came to my
[46:37] heart and mine is that the only way that
[46:39] we'll ever be able to achieve what god
[46:42] has in mind for us to
[46:43] to achieve is to take him at his word
[46:48] to really believe what he says have no
[46:51] space a room for doubt
[46:54] and so that's what i'm going to be
[46:55] talking about just starting with
[46:56] something
[46:57] um i wanted to preach on of his kind
[47:01] uh but i'll minister on that perhaps the
[47:03] next time
[47:05] because i don't think that we realize
[47:06] what god is trying to get over
[47:08] to us and the blockage is not the heart
[47:11] the blockages in the mind
[47:14] because we find it very difficult to
[47:16] believe that god could choose such
[47:18] wretched
[47:19] as we are to do a great work in us
[47:23] uh but that's the way god likes to do it
[47:25] he likes to find that
[47:26] real great mess to make something
[47:29] beautiful out of it
[47:31] and uh so i i don't want to preach on
[47:33] that tonight but i will be preaching on
[47:35] something that will try
[47:38] uh uh tie into um
[47:42] this particular thought i'm gonna be
[47:45] preaching on tonight
[47:46] trust the word trust
[47:49] the word uh coming from the uh psalm 18
[47:52] we're going to begin reading there
[47:55] at the first and second verse of that
[47:57] particular psalm
[48:01] and then we'll go to psalms 31.
[48:06] if someone can get me some water i don't
[48:08] know what i did with mine but
[48:11] i appreciate it these should be some by
[48:14] the refrigerator there
[48:17] nothing okay no problem
[48:22] psalms 18 1-2
[48:29] i will love thee oh lord
[48:33] my strength
[48:36] the lord is my rock thank you sir
[48:40] and my fortress and
[48:44] my deliverer my god
[48:48] my strength in whom
[48:53] i will trust my buckler
[48:57] and the horn of my salvation
[49:00] and my high
[49:03] tower
[49:10] let us pray
[49:16] our heavenly father we come before you
[49:19] lord as humble as we know how
[49:22] we thank you for tonight we thank you
[49:24] for
[49:26] all your loving kindness toward us the
[49:28] grace that you have bestowed
[49:30] upon us lord is
[49:35] unexplainable and unexpressable
[49:39] there's none like you and i thank you
[49:41] for your long suffering toward us
[49:44] we thank you father for being our
[49:47] creator
[49:48] our god you are our all in
[49:51] all and father we just pray that you
[49:54] give us the grace
[49:56] to move through this time of journeying
[50:00] that
[50:00] at the end of the day you will be well
[50:03] pleased with us
[50:05] bless us now in your lovely name jesus
[50:07] christ we pray
[50:09] amen you may be seated
[50:17] one of the reasons why i
[50:21] chose this particular subject or i
[50:22] believe it's just god that brought it to
[50:24] me it was concerning me
[50:27] because when you have a condition or
[50:29] something that you're working with
[50:31] and you know that you can't overcome or
[50:34] you can't do it yourself
[50:36] you have to find someone or something
[50:38] that can do it
[50:41] we know that there is nothing impossible
[50:43] for god
[50:44] and god can do all things
[50:47] and uh so you know i'm claiming my
[50:50] victory in the situation that i'm
[50:54] speaking of and i'm just believing god
[50:56] that god is going to
[50:58] give me complete deliverance
[51:02] and thinking that way god brought it to
[51:06] my attention that the only way that this
[51:07] is possible
[51:09] is that you take me at my word
[51:14] and we understand that the gentiles
[51:16] according to brother branham we don't
[51:17] need signs
[51:20] we don't need wonders in that sense
[51:22] because
[51:24] remember the roman soldier when his
[51:26] servant was sick
[51:29] he told jesus i know what it is to be a
[51:32] master
[51:33] i know what it means to be a lord and
[51:36] that thy word
[51:38] that's all i need and this is the way we
[51:41] must believe
[51:44] this is a higher calling of what god is
[51:46] bringing us to
[51:48] and all of these trials and all of these
[51:50] tests are given to us
[51:53] because god wants us to depend on his
[51:55] word
[51:57] nothing comes easy because when it does
[52:01] it's really the value of it is not even
[52:03] worth anything
[52:05] everything that is of value
[52:08] comes the harder way
[52:11] i look at the psalms and i see
[52:16] david
[52:18] who have gone through so many trials and
[52:22] tests in his
[52:23] life and all he could say is i love thee
[52:27] and you know we say that too even when
[52:28] we fail god
[52:30] we still tell god i love you
[52:33] and then god replied to us if you love
[52:35] me keep my commandments
[52:39] it comes back to believing him and
[52:41] trusting him
[52:43] i looked up that word trust it means to
[52:46] a firm belief in the reliability of
[52:50] truth
[52:51] and ability or strength of someone
[52:56] you know we know god can
[53:00] and we know god will
[53:03] you say well how do you know god will
[53:05] because the prophet god told us that
[53:07] if there was a line of angels
[53:10] and then the son of god would step in
[53:12] that line he said who
[53:14] will god tend to first
[53:17] he would tend to the son because he is a
[53:20] son
[53:23] but the very fact that he he goes on to
[53:25] say
[53:27] uh you know that the lord is my
[53:30] rock and we understand that
[53:33] that word rock doesn't mean a stone it
[53:35] means a revelation
[53:38] i'm solid he's solid
[53:42] amen he's my fortress he's my protection
[53:48] and my deliverer now david says listen
[53:51] god is everything you let him be
[53:55] in times of trouble he shall hide me
[54:01] david said he'll place me upon a rock
[54:03] he'll give me a revelation
[54:06] that would lift me up beyond
[54:09] my trials and my tests
[54:13] he says my god is my strength
[54:17] when we talk about him being a deliverer
[54:20] that means that god is able to set me
[54:22] free
[54:24] no matter what the situations
[54:27] are and would be god is more than able
[54:31] to deliver us
[54:32] but we must believe that he is a
[54:36] deliverer
[54:38] hallelujah and when we talk about
[54:42] david said he he's my strength
[54:46] in whom i will trust
[54:49] you understand me my trust
[54:52] is my strength and my trust in him
[54:56] is my strength because we are frail
[55:02] and the bible said put no trust in the
[55:04] arms of flesh
[55:06] we can't even trust ourselves so we need
[55:10] someone to trust we need a word that has
[55:13] been tried
[55:14] and the word has been tried
[55:18] even when men wouldn't trust him god
[55:21] came through
[55:24] hallelujah it goes on to say that he's
[55:28] my
[55:28] buckler you know i for a long time
[55:32] i thought i knew what a buckler was but
[55:35] a buckler is a shield
[55:37] you've ever seen it those those super
[55:41] heroes they have those shields on the um
[55:44] that's what a buckler
[55:46] is either you can wear it around or you
[55:50] can wear it here is
[55:51] his buckler and when the enemy comes you
[55:52] do what you block his
[55:55] his dots with the buckler
[55:59] i thought it was something you wore
[56:00] around your waist
[56:04] and the horn of my salvation
[56:08] and my high tower you know what the horn
[56:11] is is
[56:12] power the horn
[56:15] even represents salvation and
[56:18] immortality
[56:21] in him is my my salvation and my
[56:28] immortality
[56:30] my high tower
[56:34] and you know i didn't see that
[56:39] that you know we think about a high
[56:40] tower
[56:42] but what it is is it's a vantage point
[56:47] and in in reality it he says
[56:50] i'm gonna lift you up out of
[56:54] your trials your situation
[56:57] i'm gonna place you in a place where
[56:59] you'll be looking down
[57:01] at the enemy and not only that you'll be
[57:04] able to see
[57:05] him from afar off
[57:08] can i say it like this i'm going to
[57:10] elevate your mind
[57:12] and put you into a higher dimension
[57:16] i'm going to let you think like christ
[57:19] because remember the bible says let this
[57:22] mind be in you
[57:23] never did jesus fear anything
[57:27] and he had an undisturbed faith
[57:31] because not only did he know who he was
[57:34] but he knew
[57:35] who god was and is
[57:40] in psalms 31 and 6 goes on to say
[57:43] i have hated them that regard lying
[57:46] vanities
[57:48] but i trust in the lord and you know
[57:51] what it is it's so easy
[57:54] amen to to to to to
[57:57] allow yourself to be part of some lion
[58:00] vanity
[58:02] but think about job i'm sorry
[58:06] think about jonah who was in the whale's
[58:09] belly
[58:10] and you and i have no idea how
[58:13] horrifying that was
[58:16] but jonah never looked at the
[58:20] circumstances
[58:21] because he knew his relationship with
[58:23] god
[58:25] and the bible tells us that jonah looked
[58:28] toward
[58:29] the temple because he remembered the
[58:31] word
[58:33] solomon david
[58:36] if you shall look toward the temple
[58:40] god no matter where you are god will
[58:42] hear you
[58:43] and answer you and so we look at these
[58:47] things and you say
[58:48] to my amazement i think sometime you
[58:50] know
[58:51] how i don't know the communication that
[58:53] went on between jonah
[58:54] and the whale but the whale knew which
[58:56] way to turn
[58:58] or either jonah in the well knew which
[59:00] way to turn
[59:01] and of course he didn't have any sense
[59:04] of direction
[59:05] like like we would have today
[59:10] but we must understand that the only way
[59:12] we can ever trust god
[59:14] we must learn how to delight in him
[59:18] you know i i i still go back to what i
[59:20] said last week
[59:22] when the bible says that the grass
[59:24] withers and the flowers fade away but
[59:25] the word of the lord shall stand i never
[59:28] seemed like i never saw it the way i see
[59:30] it now
[59:31] because the word of the lord is god he
[59:34] could never perish
[59:36] he can't vanish away there's no
[59:38] beginning there's no ending he is god
[59:41] and we're just a part of his creation
[59:44] we're like this tambourine in his hand
[59:49] y'all understand what i'm saying but
[59:51] he's the god of this tambourine
[59:53] that he could do something i can't do he
[59:55] could step in there but i can't
[59:58] he could become a part of it but that's
[1:00:00] not all of him
[1:00:02] you understand me so we look at this
[1:00:04] thing which is lord
[1:00:06] help me delight in your word how can we
[1:00:09] delight in it
[1:00:10] if we don't read it how can we delight
[1:00:12] in it if we don't study it
[1:00:14] how can we delight in it if we won't
[1:00:16] find time for it
[1:00:18] hallelujah you know i don't know about
[1:00:21] you but i have some things i delight in
[1:00:24] i delight in ice cream i delight in cake
[1:00:29] i delight in certain foods you know what
[1:00:31] i mean and when i want to delight in it
[1:00:34] guess what
[1:00:35] i go find it so i can delight it
[1:00:38] that's how the word's supposed to be
[1:00:39] y'all understand me when you enjoy
[1:00:42] something you're delighting in it that
[1:00:43] means you are being
[1:00:45] it brings pleasure to you and the word
[1:00:48] must bring pleasure now i'm speaking i'm
[1:00:51] talking to me
[1:00:53] you and i must understand that we're not
[1:00:55] where we should be
[1:00:56] oh my if i preach the message that i
[1:00:59] wanted to preach tonight
[1:01:00] my god have mercy on my soul
[1:01:05] things right in your face and you don't
[1:01:07] see it until god quickens it to you
[1:01:11] delight thyself also in the lord and he
[1:01:15] shall give
[1:01:16] thee the desires of thine heart that's
[1:01:18] the problem
[1:01:21] we fail to delight because this word
[1:01:23] cannot fail
[1:01:25] if we delight ourselves in the lord you
[1:01:28] say in the lord how can i delight
[1:01:30] god in the word is one in the beginning
[1:01:32] was the word the word
[1:01:34] with god and the word was god he is god
[1:01:37] the word is
[1:01:38] and so when you delight yourself in the
[1:01:39] word you're delighting yourself
[1:01:42] in the lord and the bible says he will
[1:01:45] do what
[1:01:46] give thee the desires
[1:01:49] of thine heart i don't know about you
[1:01:54] but my desires is not to have a great
[1:01:57] mansion
[1:02:00] or some fancy car
[1:02:03] my my desires is not to have
[1:02:06] a fancy trip
[1:02:09] you know what my desire is like david
[1:02:12] said
[1:02:13] that i might dwell in the house of the
[1:02:16] lord
[1:02:18] that i might behold the beauty
[1:02:21] woo i'm getting ready to cry up here
[1:02:27] i have only one desire and that is to
[1:02:29] serve the lord
[1:02:31] and i want to fully commit
[1:02:35] everything that i have in his trust
[1:02:42] and it goes on to say and he shall bring
[1:02:44] forth
[1:02:45] righteousness as the light
[1:02:48] and judgment as a new day
[1:02:52] he shall bring forth the word will bring
[1:02:54] forth the lord will bring forth
[1:02:56] we don't have to work it as long as we
[1:02:59] are delighting
[1:03:00] the life of the word will bring it forth
[1:03:03] it is the light
[1:03:04] that brings forth righteousness
[1:03:08] i love the seventh verse it says rest
[1:03:11] in the lord
[1:03:15] you don't have to worry about nothing
[1:03:16] when you are in the lord
[1:03:18] rest it's not you that do with the work
[1:03:21] he
[1:03:22] does the work and wait here it is
[1:03:26] patiently for
[1:03:29] him the trouble is we are slacking
[1:03:32] lacking patience amen
[1:03:37] we want it so fast and so quick
[1:03:41] but god don't even make trees grow like
[1:03:43] that
[1:03:44] and you are a tree little by
[1:03:48] little god is working on you he's not in
[1:03:51] a hurry
[1:03:52] he's a perfectionist i love that
[1:03:55] i want to be perfect let him perfect me
[1:03:59] i am his workmanship you are his
[1:04:02] workmanship
[1:04:03] created where in him
[1:04:09] who have known the mind of the lord or
[1:04:12] who have been his counselor
[1:04:16] anybody can tell me can you direct the
[1:04:18] lord
[1:04:20] the bible says the footsteps of a
[1:04:21] righteous man
[1:04:23] are ordered by the lord
[1:04:26] what absolutely even when you're walking
[1:04:30] in the valley in the shadow of
[1:04:32] death your footsteps are still being
[1:04:34] ordered by god
[1:04:36] oh my goodness you mean dangerous times
[1:04:40] through perilous times all of those
[1:04:42] kinds of times your times when you're
[1:04:44] upset
[1:04:45] the times when you're down in spirit the
[1:04:47] times amen when you're happy are glad
[1:04:50] all of those times are being directed by
[1:04:52] god
[1:04:54] moses could have said to israel moses
[1:04:56] could have said to god
[1:04:58] why you lead me out here like this to
[1:05:00] perish
[1:05:02] but all of that i love the way god does
[1:05:05] it
[1:05:05] he never tells you what the future holds
[1:05:08] but he'll definitely lead you into it
[1:05:10] and your future as you move through it
[1:05:13] is not always
[1:05:14] happy days hallelujah
[1:05:18] you understand me god will put you
[1:05:21] in trouble just to get you out
[1:05:24] how can he be a deliverer if he doesn't
[1:05:27] allow you to fall into bondage
[1:05:30] somebody should have shouted
[1:05:34] huh all of these things the bible says
[1:05:36] all things work together for the good of
[1:05:38] them that love the lord those who are
[1:05:40] called
[1:05:41] according to his purpose his purpose
[1:05:44] is the thing that's motivating him to do
[1:05:47] to you
[1:05:49] what he's doing and what we need to do
[1:05:52] is delight in it
[1:05:53] in all things the bible says give thanks
[1:05:59] job said the 14 2 says shall he
[1:06:03] that contendeth with the almighty
[1:06:05] instruct him
[1:06:07] he that reproveth god let him answer it
[1:06:11] and you know what that is it's when you
[1:06:14] contend
[1:06:15] but god you know how your children oh i
[1:06:18] don't
[1:06:18] you go into but oh go into the trash do
[1:06:22] i have to
[1:06:22] i did it tuesday you understand me
[1:06:26] it's the same thing we do with god god
[1:06:28] instructs us god gives us a place
[1:06:30] amen and walks us and take us through
[1:06:33] things and we
[1:06:34] are we we we give the big butt
[1:06:37] and why me because you prayed
[1:06:41] lord i want to be just like you that's
[1:06:43] why
[1:06:44] you prayed it and he answering your
[1:06:46] prayer
[1:06:47] but maybe not according to the way you
[1:06:49] want it to be answered
[1:06:52] but we must learn how to trust the word
[1:06:54] we must learn how to really trust god
[1:06:56] because
[1:06:57] if we're going to be and i'm jumping to
[1:06:59] my new message of his kind
[1:07:02] jesus never failed god at one
[1:07:05] or any point everything he was ordered
[1:07:08] to do he did it
[1:07:10] even when he didn't even want to what he
[1:07:12] didn't want to go to the calvary
[1:07:14] calvary of the cross and he says
[1:07:17] nevertheless father not my will but
[1:07:19] thine be done
[1:07:22] people look at a lot of abuses and they
[1:07:24] think my god
[1:07:26] you mean to tell me god allowed this to
[1:07:29] happen
[1:07:30] what do you mean he's the creator
[1:07:34] he knew it was going to happen before
[1:07:35] you got there
[1:07:37] but no matter what go you go through he
[1:07:40] has a time
[1:07:41] that he he has appointed to meet you
[1:07:45] what about the woman at the well she
[1:07:48] probably thought she was cursed
[1:07:50] and perhaps she was going to die like
[1:07:52] that
[1:07:53] but god allowed that to be so
[1:07:57] just to prove he is a deliverer and
[1:08:00] a healer because not only was she's a
[1:08:03] prostitute but she had some physical
[1:08:05] ailments as well
[1:08:10] oh my many things that happen
[1:08:13] to us it's because of our own decisions
[1:08:16] that we make
[1:08:18] but yet we want to blame it on god and
[1:08:20] who's going to reprove him
[1:08:22] who's going to tell him he's wrong who's
[1:08:24] going to tell him that there's a better
[1:08:26] way
[1:08:27] and that's your way it ain't happening
[1:08:34] the bible says we all sin and come short
[1:08:36] of the glory of god
[1:08:39] now i want to say something to you
[1:08:41] before i go to my next page i'm going to
[1:08:42] read a quote coming
[1:08:44] from the birth pains because a lot of
[1:08:46] times we don't understand if we can see
[1:08:48] where we're standing
[1:08:49] and where we need to go it would scare
[1:08:51] us half to death
[1:08:55] knowing that you got to know that you'll
[1:08:57] never get there
[1:08:58] until god take you there none of us amen
[1:09:02] can produce
[1:09:03] desperation desperation even desperation
[1:09:07] is given and caused by god
[1:09:11] hard trials and tribulations and all
[1:09:14] kinds of stuff will push you into a
[1:09:16] place of
[1:09:16] desperation because as men we're lazy
[1:09:20] dollatory right it takes god
[1:09:25] to even push us into a desperate mode
[1:09:29] now we find that rain which brings forth
[1:09:32] fruit upon the earth
[1:09:35] it's born as the porch says
[1:09:38] in the fields of thunder and ragged and
[1:09:41] jagged skies
[1:09:43] the little distilled drop of rain that's
[1:09:46] been lifted
[1:09:47] from the seas and distilled from salt
[1:09:50] it will not be born it takes that
[1:09:54] lightning
[1:09:55] thundering blast ragged
[1:09:58] rugged fearful thing to bring forth the
[1:10:02] soft
[1:10:02] petal drops of water
[1:10:05] it takes pain to bring forth
[1:10:09] birth and a lot of people on easy birth
[1:10:13] they want a scientific birth they want
[1:10:16] like a test tube baby
[1:10:18] hey they don't come through no pain
[1:10:21] they just test two babies but those who
[1:10:24] are born amen coming from in the natural
[1:10:27] way there is
[1:10:28] pain there's pain to the mother and
[1:10:31] there's pain to the child
[1:10:34] it is a frustrating time it's a time
[1:10:37] when you have to push when you don't
[1:10:39] feel like pushing
[1:10:41] but yet and still that's the way god has
[1:10:44] designed it
[1:10:46] some of us haven't cried tears in years
[1:10:50] if if any but let me tell you something
[1:10:54] there is no such thing as a dried eye
[1:10:56] conversion
[1:11:00] it takes dying as the clouds
[1:11:03] die rain right
[1:11:07] is born when they die the rain is born
[1:11:11] because
[1:11:12] rain is a part of that cloud
[1:11:15] one has to cease so the other one can
[1:11:19] exist and i want you to remember that
[1:11:22] because that's exactly where i'm going
[1:11:23] the next time i minister
[1:11:25] one has to cease in order to go
[1:11:29] the other one to exist so powerful
[1:11:35] but delight that depending on the word
[1:11:39] it's what we must learn how to do
[1:11:44] um it's kind of like what god told uh
[1:11:47] you know the the leopard name and i
[1:11:50] believe it was he
[1:11:51] go dip seven times why that
[1:11:55] you're gonna tend with god i mean come
[1:11:58] on anybody in their right mind know that
[1:12:00] this is the dirtiest rival around
[1:12:02] and how having leprosy which come from
[1:12:05] uncleanness
[1:12:07] how can it be cleaned but god is the
[1:12:09] only one can break something clean
[1:12:11] out of the unclean he's the only one
[1:12:15] i'm a witness on what god can do
[1:12:19] he can take the unclean and make him
[1:12:21] clean
[1:12:23] hallelujah but what it made no sense
[1:12:26] to the natural mind god didn't say
[1:12:29] to us his my his word has to make sense
[1:12:32] his word is on a level that we can't
[1:12:34] even comprehend
[1:12:37] so therefore it takes faith you must
[1:12:40] trust it
[1:12:42] had not named and dipped seven times he
[1:12:45] would have died a leopard
[1:12:48] six times wouldn't have done it five
[1:12:49] times would have done it four times
[1:12:51] would have done would not have done it
[1:12:53] he had to dip seven times because that
[1:12:56] was the word of the lord
[1:12:58] and you and i must understand when god
[1:13:00] said do something that's exactly what he
[1:13:02] says
[1:13:03] and that's exactly what he means
[1:13:05] hallelujah
[1:13:06] and we cannot reason it
[1:13:10] can you imagine staying up there in the
[1:13:13] upper room
[1:13:14] all those days i think it was 10.
[1:13:18] ten days shut up in that place
[1:13:21] with all those folks
[1:13:24] i don't know what they did and what they
[1:13:26] were doing but you know what
[1:13:27] i don't even know where the
[1:13:28] claustrophobia a
[1:13:32] but it had to be a very uncomfortable
[1:13:35] thing going on there
[1:13:36] and in the midst of that god tried them
[1:13:41] tried their patience tried them
[1:13:44] and 10 days amen they were rewarded
[1:13:47] guarantee you
[1:13:49] after those 10 days they thought it was
[1:13:51] worth it all
[1:13:53] see when god comes to reward you it's
[1:13:55] worth
[1:13:56] it all hallelujah
[1:13:59] taking god that is what we must come to
[1:14:02] a place
[1:14:02] we must come to that place people i said
[1:14:05] we because i'm including
[1:14:06] myself
[1:14:10] that we trust his word believe his word
[1:14:14] acknowledge his word to be true
[1:14:18] hallelujah proverbs 18 and 10 like i
[1:14:21] said
[1:14:22] he said the name of the lord is a strong
[1:14:24] tower
[1:14:25] the righteous runeth unto it and is safe
[1:14:30] hallelujah in other words he the
[1:14:31] righteous run it into it
[1:14:33] and it's set on high a tower that's
[1:14:36] lifted up
[1:14:37] up above the troubles which seemed to
[1:14:41] overwhelm have you ever felt the
[1:14:42] overwhelming
[1:14:44] and all when we do that we need to learn
[1:14:47] how to run
[1:14:48] the righteous running in and they are
[1:14:52] safe
[1:14:55] listen it is i be not afraid
[1:15:00] brother said i'm so glad that he
[1:15:03] is our safety zone he's the place
[1:15:08] where we can come and feel
[1:15:11] safe the thing i love about the lord
[1:15:14] jesus he'll
[1:15:15] never reject you
[1:15:18] ever reject you
[1:15:21] most of the time if you come to god
[1:15:23] he'll meet you
[1:15:25] on the way in the message god's chosen
[1:15:30] place of worship
[1:15:31] he said the only safety zone there
[1:15:34] is in the is is the lamb of god and him
[1:15:37] alone is salvation
[1:15:39] not in any church any creed
[1:15:42] any people any father any mother
[1:15:46] any holy man or nothing nothing no holy
[1:15:49] place
[1:15:50] it's in the holy god the lord jesus
[1:15:54] christ where god placed his name
[1:15:58] on a human being for redemption
[1:16:01] who paid the price for a sinners
[1:16:05] oh wait a minute now see we hear that
[1:16:07] all the time
[1:16:08] as if we owe god something you don't owe
[1:16:12] him nothing
[1:16:13] he paid the price the price has been
[1:16:16] paid
[1:16:17] you can't redeem yourself there is no
[1:16:20] price you need to pay
[1:16:26] for sinners for us sinners see that's
[1:16:28] the only place
[1:16:29] that there is salvation see
[1:16:33] that's the rock i stand on so when the
[1:16:36] devil is accusing you
[1:16:38] of your sins and your shortcoming let
[1:16:40] him know
[1:16:41] the bible said we have faults we will
[1:16:45] sin
[1:16:46] the bible said if a man say he have no
[1:16:48] sin he makes god a liar
[1:16:50] and the only reason why god counts us
[1:16:53] justified as he do
[1:16:54] does is because our lives are hid in him
[1:16:58] when i see the blood i pass over you
[1:17:00] it's not
[1:17:01] because you're so righteous no but the
[1:17:03] blood has been applied
[1:17:06] hallelujah who
[1:17:09] and where will you place your trust
[1:17:15] when we know by god's grace that
[1:17:16] everything is going to fall
[1:17:19] everything is failing everything is
[1:17:22] failing
[1:17:24] he said god said it was
[1:17:27] the whole heaven and earth is going to
[1:17:30] be on fire
[1:17:32] hallelujah it's going to be a renovation
[1:17:36] of the whole thing so a new world can be
[1:17:40] born
[1:17:41] god has prophesied it
[1:17:45] see she's rotten in all of her systems
[1:17:49] talk about the world she's got
[1:17:52] to do that to rot away
[1:17:56] that's why she says i said she is
[1:17:59] so nervous and red in the face and
[1:18:03] frustrated
[1:18:04] and earthquakes and everywhere and up
[1:18:07] and down the coast
[1:18:08] and tidal waves in alaska and shaking up
[1:18:11] and down the coast
[1:18:14] hallelujah of earthquakes and and things
[1:18:16] and people
[1:18:18] writing shall we leave it shall we leave
[1:18:20] it see
[1:18:22] they don't know what to do there's no
[1:18:26] safety zone y'all hear me
[1:18:29] the thing is we a lot of times we think
[1:18:31] oh there's a state no
[1:18:32] no not even in iowa there is no safety
[1:18:35] zone
[1:18:36] when the world began to reel and rock
[1:18:40] it ain't going to just happen in
[1:18:41] california it's going to be all over the
[1:18:44] world
[1:18:47] but how can you feel sheltered if you
[1:18:50] don't trust the word
[1:18:52] and the bible said he is our shelter
[1:18:55] he's our hiding place hiding with uh on
[1:18:59] what
[1:18:59] under the shadows of his weak people
[1:19:03] we have something that the world does
[1:19:05] not
[1:19:07] we've got a greater revelation of god
[1:19:10] than noah had
[1:19:14] huh and the bible said in i walk with
[1:19:16] god
[1:19:17] he in order to walk follow me follow me
[1:19:20] follow me is that right because that's
[1:19:22] what jesus said when he was
[1:19:23] uh recruiting or his his
[1:19:27] his followers follow me follow me
[1:19:30] follow me what was it the word was
[1:19:33] saying
[1:19:33] follow me follow me follow me and the
[1:19:36] reason why is because even when
[1:19:38] israel was a a nation
[1:19:41] that that had the the ark of the
[1:19:44] covenant the ark of the covenant went
[1:19:46] first the word went first and everything
[1:19:50] afterward
[1:19:51] had to follow god can't change his ways
[1:19:56] it's settled in heaven in order for us
[1:19:58] to achieve to achieve heaven
[1:20:00] we must follow the word and believe
[1:20:03] every
[1:20:04] word is that right there's only one
[1:20:08] thing that is the safety zone
[1:20:10] and that's in him all outside of there
[1:20:14] will perish
[1:20:15] just as certain as god said so
[1:20:20] a new creation god trying to get us to a
[1:20:23] place
[1:20:23] where we can see exactly what he's
[1:20:25] trying to do with us
[1:20:27] and you and i must understand that you
[1:20:29] know coming into this
[1:20:32] coming into this uh message is one of
[1:20:36] the greatest things that could have
[1:20:37] possibly happened to us
[1:20:40] and you and i must understand that the
[1:20:43] new creation is not a patched
[1:20:45] up job it is so new it's so distinct
[1:20:49] from the old one
[1:20:51] and how are we going to make except the
[1:20:53] creator
[1:20:54] do something this is not oh
[1:20:58] i choose god this is god chose us
[1:21:03] and if god predestinated us to be broad
[1:21:06] he has a work for us
[1:21:08] this is not the beginning ending this is
[1:21:09] the beginning
[1:21:11] and you and i must not complain about
[1:21:14] the situations and
[1:21:15] the tough times that we have listen i'm
[1:21:17] going through some tough times now
[1:21:19] but i realize that everything i'm going
[1:21:21] through has been ordained by god
[1:21:24] why should i feel fear
[1:21:27] in my way i gotta cry sometime no
[1:21:31] i'm not saying in the blues
[1:21:36] not gonna do it i will enter his gates
[1:21:40] with thanksgiving in my heart i will
[1:21:43] enter his courts with
[1:21:44] praise hallelujah why
[1:21:47] because this is the day that the lord is
[1:21:50] made
[1:21:51] and i shall rejoice and be glad in it
[1:21:53] i've got one more scripture
[1:21:55] i told you i'm not gonna be long this is
[1:21:57] wednesday everybody's tired
[1:22:01] and it's quite warm in the place turn
[1:22:03] with me one more one two
[1:22:04] psalms 102 psalms 102.
[1:22:10] you love the lord i trust this is a
[1:22:13] blessing this is just a little prelude
[1:22:15] to where i'm going
[1:22:17] uh by god's grace and i'm grateful i'm
[1:22:20] i can't i can't express i'm trusting
[1:22:23] that what god
[1:22:24] has revealed in to me will be quickened
[1:22:29] in me until i am exactly what
[1:22:32] what he has ordained me to be uh and
[1:22:35] that is the bride of jesus christ
[1:22:38] psalms 102 we'll begin at the
[1:22:42] 16th verse when the lord shall
[1:22:46] build up zion he
[1:22:49] shall appear in his glory y'all get that
[1:22:53] one
[1:22:55] that doesn't need to be explained or
[1:22:56] defined right when did he appear in our
[1:22:59] day
[1:23:00] in his glory he showed he was a healer
[1:23:03] he showed he was a deliverer
[1:23:04] he showed that he had he could he could
[1:23:06] he he he knew your thoughts
[1:23:09] how did he do that by way of malachi 4.
[1:23:12] that was god's appearing
[1:23:16] in his glory did y'all know that you
[1:23:19] said well what do you mean in the glory
[1:23:20] that's what i said the last time
[1:23:22] in his glory lord let the glory that we
[1:23:26] i had with you from the beginning
[1:23:30] be with them what was the glory
[1:23:33] god in you that is the glory
[1:23:37] god and man coming together you becoming
[1:23:40] a new creature
[1:23:41] creation a god man
[1:23:44] the bible showed us amen in revelation
[1:23:47] uh
[1:23:48] where the glory of god was upon the
[1:23:50] bride
[1:23:51] see you got to understand what the glory
[1:23:53] is that's why jesus never sought a
[1:23:56] reputation
[1:23:57] he always pointed back to god the spirit
[1:24:01] because he understood he never did
[1:24:03] anything
[1:24:04] it was god in him that did everything
[1:24:06] and you're not that is the glory of the
[1:24:09] lord
[1:24:10] right the glory of the lord it comes
[1:24:12] down on
[1:24:13] on the cherubims and set there amen on
[1:24:16] the altar
[1:24:17] hallelujah those things weren't sacred
[1:24:21] only when the glory of god was upon it
[1:24:24] wasn't unholy about those things that
[1:24:26] they made
[1:24:28] they were made out of metal they were
[1:24:30] made out of
[1:24:31] excuse me they were made out of natural
[1:24:33] things
[1:24:34] but oh when the glory of god came down
[1:24:38] that's what israel feared they feared
[1:24:41] the glory of god
[1:24:44] so much so the glory of god was in moses
[1:24:46] that he had to hide his faith he had to
[1:24:48] veil himself
[1:24:50] that's the kind of glory that god wants
[1:24:52] in us that we're so
[1:24:53] much like him we'll pull him out of
[1:24:55] heaven
[1:24:57] hallelujah he will regard the prayer of
[1:25:00] the destitute i love this
[1:25:03] and not despise their prayer sometimes
[1:25:06] we just can't be honest with god because
[1:25:08] we're so afraid that he's going to
[1:25:09] despise it
[1:25:10] let me tell you something that maybe you
[1:25:12] don't know god knows exactly what's in
[1:25:14] your heart
[1:25:15] and he knows every word that you're
[1:25:16] going to express to him before you
[1:25:18] express it
[1:25:19] he knows how filthy and dirty we could
[1:25:21] be come on it's the truth
[1:25:24] god ah i didn't know that no he knew
[1:25:27] that
[1:25:28] he knows that and the thing is we need
[1:25:30] to be honest with him
[1:25:32] you don't get before god and says lord
[1:25:34] forgive me of my known and my unknown
[1:25:36] sins come on
[1:25:39] you know what your sins are you know
[1:25:41] what you're thinking you know even the
[1:25:43] desires that you entertain even though
[1:25:45] they weren't yours
[1:25:46] you took them in from the devil
[1:25:51] he knows that and you need to tell god
[1:25:53] about it lord this is the way i was
[1:25:55] thinking it was wrong and i'm so sorry
[1:25:57] you say well brother books you do that
[1:25:59] absolutely let me tell you something
[1:26:01] the first time i had to really come
[1:26:02] clean with god was very very difficult
[1:26:07] because you know what i didn't know for
[1:26:09] some reason
[1:26:10] i thought he didn't know i was it was in
[1:26:13] revelation
[1:26:14] that he understood the very intents of
[1:26:17] my heart
[1:26:18] it was not a revelation so i thought in
[1:26:20] my confession
[1:26:21] i was kind of like telling god something
[1:26:23] he did not know already
[1:26:26] you know that's quite dumb right but
[1:26:28] that's just how dumb i was
[1:26:30] but guess what i call it like it is
[1:26:34] just like it was this shall be
[1:26:38] written listen for the generations to
[1:26:41] come
[1:26:44] and the people which shall be created
[1:26:47] shall praise the lord i'm gonna leave it
[1:26:50] just there
[1:26:51] what people what people that's being
[1:26:55] created
[1:26:57] now jesus christ
[1:27:00] the beginning of god's creation oh i got
[1:27:03] so many
[1:27:03] so good stuff but i ain't gonna go with
[1:27:05] it the truth of the matter is
[1:27:07] we worry
[1:27:10] about things we should not worry about
[1:27:15] and so that you'll understand change
[1:27:19] only comes by god
[1:27:22] you know we used to there used to be a
[1:27:25] song
[1:27:26] in the question that was asked what
[1:27:29] could grow
[1:27:31] without snow or rain in that song and
[1:27:34] i can't remember the whole thing but i
[1:27:36] really used to like that song and that
[1:27:38] was the phrase that i really liked
[1:27:41] and the end of that was a rock can grow
[1:27:47] without snow or rain
[1:27:50] and uh so anyway
[1:27:53] god is the only thing god is the only
[1:27:55] one that can make a man grow
[1:27:57] y'all know what i'm saying i have a
[1:27:58] friend now he's he's a short fella
[1:28:00] and he for a long time thought when i
[1:28:02] get to heaven you know i'm going to be
[1:28:04] 6-3-6-4 i'm like no
[1:28:09] when you get to heaven you're going to
[1:28:11] have the same height you got now
[1:28:14] right somehow people think when i get to
[1:28:17] heaven
[1:28:18] what they describe as being perfect they
[1:28:20] don't understand
[1:28:22] it ain't the house that god perfects
[1:28:26] it's the character
[1:28:30] you see that's what god looking at
[1:28:31] nature change
[1:28:34] and you and i must understand as we are
[1:28:37] at all the hard times we're going
[1:28:39] through the trials and tests
[1:28:41] this is just the beginning
[1:28:44] you know when i'm baking a cake you know
[1:28:46] i said
[1:28:48] don't tell me about that but anyway when
[1:28:50] i do that i put it on a certain degree
[1:28:52] for
[1:28:53] a certain hour but when i'm ready to
[1:28:56] crown it i turn that thing back
[1:28:58] turn it up to a certain degree to make
[1:29:01] sure it's smooth
[1:29:02] you know what i'm trying to say what i'm
[1:29:03] trying to say is this
[1:29:05] god got it at a certain temperature but
[1:29:08] in order to bring you to the place he
[1:29:10] wants you to be or wants us to be
[1:29:12] he's going to turn the fire up
[1:29:16] you're going to have to trust him
[1:29:18] brother branham said it like this he
[1:29:20] said
[1:29:20] it was it was the hebrew boys it was set
[1:29:24] seven times hotter and he says
[1:29:27] this age is seven times hotter
[1:29:31] than what they had
[1:29:34] and you know what that was all about to
[1:29:37] test
[1:29:38] their faith and guess what brother madam
[1:29:41] said
[1:29:41] they may have had an all-night prayer
[1:29:44] and god
[1:29:45] never answered the prayer but they were
[1:29:48] so convinced that god was god
[1:29:52] they said even if he don't answer i'll
[1:29:56] never bow down to you devil see what i'm
[1:29:59] saying
[1:30:00] even if he doesn't answer i'm
[1:30:03] not going to bow to the devil i'll stay
[1:30:07] with his word like they used to sing
[1:30:08] that song and that old pentecostal
[1:30:10] church
[1:30:11] i believe i'll run on to see what the
[1:30:14] end is going to be
[1:30:16] less than heavenly father we come before
[1:30:21] you lord it's homeless we know how and
[1:30:24] we thank you for your goodness and your
[1:30:26] grace

[1:30:32] place

[1:31:19] came up for prayer he was blind
[1:31:25] paper boy
[1:31:28] brother branham prayed for him and he
[1:31:29] said he believed
[1:31:32] but he kept coming back up through the
[1:31:34] line and brother brandon said
[1:31:36] i thought you said you believe
[1:31:39] see once you really believe you don't
[1:31:41] have to have a second chance you don't
[1:31:43] need to come back
[1:31:44] up but you got to confess you believe
[1:31:50] that john ryan would get out there in
[1:31:52] the corner says extra extra read all
[1:31:54] about it i'm healed
[1:31:56] he kept confessing it until that
[1:31:59] confession became part of him
[1:32:02] and you and i must only understand that
[1:32:04] the battle is
[1:32:05] the victory is already given
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] but we must continue to confess it i
[1:32:10] don't care if you fall you fall
[1:32:12] you fall you must confess your bride you
[1:32:15] must confess your perfect
[1:32:17] you must confess your victory you must
[1:32:19] confess your deliverance
[1:32:21] if you only keep confessing it brother
[1:32:23] brown said there's an
[1:32:24] angel listening that will bring it to
[1:32:28] pass
[1:32:29] he'll make it happen and you and i must
