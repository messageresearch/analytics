[2:32] [Music]
[2:38] Lord Matthew
[2:42] 26441 and he cometh into his
[2:45] disciples and finded them
[2:47] asleep and said unto Peter what could
[2:51] you not watch with me one
[2:56] hour watch and pray that you enter not
[3:00] into
[3:02] temptation the spirit indeed is
[3:05] willing but the flesh is
[3:07] weak so what is he
[3:10] saying when you pray your spirit is
[3:14] willing but your flesh is
[3:18] weak you know and I know the spirit that
[3:22] fights you the most when you get on your
[3:26] knees is sleep amen
[3:31] Hallelujah you're not the first and
[3:33] you're not the last but you've got to
[3:36] fight that
[3:38] Spirit you got to press through
[3:40] sleep in order to get the
[3:43] victory Hallelujah you know why Satan
[3:48] got something up the road for
[3:50] you and it a it is not
[3:54] good Jesus saw them
[4:01] listen let's see what the 45th verse
[4:04] says then he came to his disciples and
[4:06] said unto them are you still sleeping
[4:09] and resting see the time is
[4:12] near the son of man is betrayed into the
[4:15] hands of
[4:17] Sinners get up let's go see my betrayal
[4:23] is
[4:25] near Y what do you mean brother brother
[4:28] you got to understand
[4:30] this son of
[4:32] man this son of
[4:34] man this son of man Hallelujah has
[4:38] already been betrayed you said well what
[4:40] do you mean they know where you live
[4:43] they got your number they know what you
[4:46] believe Hallelujah is that right those
[4:51] 200 million
[4:52] demons that was loosed out of the river
[4:56] [Music]
[4:58] Euphrates brother brother brandham said
[5:01] they were loosed on the
[5:03] bride is that right the whole
[5:07] purpose was to attack the
[5:12] bride this whole political Ram is to
[5:16] attack the bride to kill the Royal
[5:20] seed but he also said they won't be able
[5:24] to do it Hallelujah Hall why because the
[5:28] rapture
[5:30] he will take us away before the great
[5:33] attack Hallelujah but the only thing is
[5:38] the foolish versions will get the
[5:42] lck hallelujah hallelujah it ain't time
[5:45] to be foolish do whatever you
[5:48] can Hallelujah you got to forsake all
[5:54] now you got to forsake all it's later
[5:57] than what we think
[5:59] let's turn to Mark
[6:01] 13 remember the one time he came to them
[6:05] and they were still
[6:06] asleep and he said sleep
[6:10] on that's not
[6:12] good danger was a lurk lurking he told
[6:16] him to sleep on but then when that exact
[6:20] time came that appoint in time you see
[6:24] Jesus knew exactly his his his his his
[6:28] purpose he knew knew when it was time to
[6:32] allow the enemy to capture
[6:34] him is that right cuz remember one time
[6:38] they circled
[6:39] him and they tried to get him then and
[6:42] the Bible said he walked through the
[6:44] crowd is that right they wanted to throw
[6:47] him over the mountain over the hillside
[6:50] Hallelujah and God would not allow them
[6:52] to do it why because it wasn't TI
[6:57] Hallelujah we said even Lord come come
[7:01] come Hallelujah but the time is not
[7:04] exactly
[7:05] now but we are approaching that
[7:08] time Hallelujah this is a time he's
[7:11] going to either say sleep on or get up
[7:16] Hallelujah I don't know about you but he
[7:19] told me to get up Hallelujah this is not
[7:23] a time to
[7:25] sleep hallelujah hallelujah Mark
[7:28] 13
[7:29] [Music]
[7:34] 28-33 are you there yet now learn a
[7:37] parable of the Fig
[7:40] Tree when her branch is yet
[7:43] tender and put it forth
[7:46] leaves she know the summer is not near
[7:50] so she so ye in like manner when you see
[7:54] these things come to
[7:56] pass know that it is nigh even at the
[8:02] door go ahead I'm sorry remember even at
[8:05] the
[8:06] door even at the
[8:09] door verily I say unto
[8:12] you that this generation shall not pass
[8:16] till all these things be
[8:18] done hallelujah Heaven and Earth shall
[8:22] pass away but my words shall
[8:25] not hey if you can't stand on nothing
[8:28] else

[8:34] pass away but my words will not pass
[8:37] away hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[8:41] if he promis you stand on the promise
[8:44] Hallelujah if he promise you you'll take
[8:47] a Rapture stand on it Hallelujah you
[8:51] don't take a Rapture because of how good
[8:54] you've been Hallelujah you take a
[8:57] Rapture because he applied the blood and
[9:01] the Bible says when I see the blood I
[9:05] will pass over you that is the only
[9:08] reason you take the blood you you make a
[9:12] Rapture the blood justifies you the
[9:15] blood sanctifies you and the blood fills
[9:18] you with his holy ghost that's it I'm
[9:23] Standing on the Promises of God
[9:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but of
[9:29] that day and that hour no man
[9:33] know know not the Angels which are in
[9:36] heaven neither the son of man but the
[9:39] father take ye he watch and pray for ye
[9:44] know not when that time
[9:47] is hallelujah hallu you love the Lord

[9:53] May 17 brother random said May
[9:57] 17th is when no
[10:04] went Hallelujah May
[10:08] 17 is when the cloud
[10:11] came I'm just saying I don't know what
[10:14] God is doing but I I don't believe
[10:17] that's a
[10:18] coincidence you understand me that
[10:20] cannot be a
[10:22] coincidence y'all understand what I'm
[10:24] saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[10:26] today and forever I will never put a day
[10:29] on a day no sir but a significant thing
[10:33] happened Hallelujah in our day in
[10:39] 1963
[10:41] Hallelujah glory to God even as he said
[10:44] as I went away I'll come again and don't
[10:47] get me wrong I believe in his literal
[10:50] coming oh absolutely but I want you to
[10:53] understand the world didn't see what we
[10:56] saw can't see it Hallelujah and the
[11:00] bride when God opened those seals she
[11:04] understood it's time to make yourself
[11:08] ready hallelujah it's time to make
[11:11] yourself
[11:12] ready because he's appeared and now he's
[11:16] coming Hallelujah is that right yeah I
[11:19] think he's in choosing of a
[11:21] bride I just to the message
[11:26] um might have been Easter see brother B
[11:28] talked about
[11:30] the ranous
[11:32] son the ranous son I mean the six seal
[11:35] excuse me six seal the the Rancher son
[11:39] coming you see he came once as he
[11:45] appeared but the next time he came to
[11:48] take
[11:49] her that was a mystery of the seventh
[11:52] seal he came and he saw her and he
[11:56] promised her I'm coming again
[12:00] this time about a year I'm coming again
[12:04] Hallelujah but this second time when he
[12:07] came Hallelujah he had already prepared
[12:11] the
[12:12] Mansion Hallelujah is that right and he
[12:16] says now I'm coming to get
[12:19] you but during that time there was a
[12:22] persecution went on they mocked her they
[12:26] sced her
[12:29] do you think God has chosen you to be
[12:33] bride Hallelujah come on Higher Ground
[12:36] Tabernacle I believe I'm a barefooted
[12:41] nobody Hallelujah but God chose you and
[12:45] God chose me and I'll stand on his
[12:49] promise Hallelujah they can laugh all
[12:52] they want no we don't have no fancy CL
[12:56] we don't have all that stuff but one we
[12:59] have is a
[13:02] promise from the Rancher son
[13:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is that
[13:09] right oh we know this is the time
[13:12] Hallelujah we know this is the
[13:15] time Hallelujah is that right six seal
[13:20] again
[13:25] 259 my sheep hear my
[13:28] voice when these things are supposed to
[13:30] be taking place in the last
[13:34] days sheep of God recognize
[13:38] that Hallelujah is that right yes sir
[13:41] see they recognize it my sheep know me
[13:46] see strangers they won't follow don't
[13:50] follow them
[13:51] strangers it's got to be a Vindicated
[13:54] sign of the day and they see
[13:57] it now now notice what are you saying we
[14:02] follow the message of William Brandon
[14:05] because we've heard his
[14:07] voice not the man's voice but the voice
[14:10] of God in the man Hallelujah my sheep
[14:14] hear my voice and a stranger they will
[14:17] not follow Hallelujah you love the Lord
[14:22] watch and pray this is a time to watch
[14:24] and
[14:25] pray because everything is pointing to
[14:28] the
[14:31] end Hallelujah is that right brother bam
[14:34] said I think it's the third
[14:37] chapter that's when the bride
[14:40] leaves Hallelujah so when the six seal
[14:43] is really
[14:44] open in its
[14:49] fullness we'll be
[14:51] gone than
[14:54] Lord let me read this again now
[14:58] concerning that that day or hour no one
[15:02] knows either the angel neither the
[15:04] angels in Heaven nor the Sun but only
[15:07] the father watch be alert that's the
[15:11] word I want be
[15:13] alert for you don't know when the time
[15:17] is
[15:18] coming you got to be alert you got to
[15:21] watch you got to
[15:22] pray
[15:24] Hallelujah yes sir you look and see how
[15:28] the world has
[15:32] Hallelujah something I saw
[15:36] today we know of the Roman
[15:39] Empire and you know how they control a
[15:41] thousand
[15:43] years and that same spirit is moving
[15:48] today to control the world
[15:51] again y'all hear what I'm saying she's
[15:54] working her her same
[15:57] system going to take your money away put
[16:01] you on that digital stuff y'all better
[16:04] hear what I'm saying it's working right
[16:08] now like a
[16:11] serpent it has slithered through
[16:14] time and many of us have been blind to
[16:17] what they're
[16:18] doing
[16:20] Hallelujah I'm telling you something now
[16:23] but when they did this thing with
[16:26] Co Hallelujah they learned how well they
[16:29] can control
[16:32] you they also developed they
[16:35] knew how to make you fight one
[16:39] another did not if you didn't wear a
[16:42] mask people wanted to fight
[16:44] you if you didn't have your shot people
[16:47] wanted to fight
[16:49] you and now we find
[16:52] out the shot was no
[16:56] good amen amen that's true it kill more
[17:01] people than help
[17:05] them but they
[17:07] learn give a man a
[17:10] dollar he'll humble
[17:12] himself how many of y'all was happy for
[17:15] them what call the C what the packages
[17:20] stimulus stimulus it stimulated you
[17:27] didn't don't you get me
[17:29] wrong it it stimulated me
[17:32] too but they saw what they could
[17:36] do and we fell right into
[17:38] it now they're getting ready to take it
[17:41] further it it's not something to be
[17:43] afraid of Hallelujah because God keeps
[17:47] us he's the one that protects Us Hal oh
[17:51] come on somebody amen if God can step in
[17:55] the fire with the Hebrew boys he can
[17:57] step in our fire
[18:00] Hallelujah now you must
[18:03] remember that God calls
[18:06] individuals and not a nation of
[18:09] genti Hallelujah so you can't say
[18:12] well uh how can I say without being
[18:16] offensive I'll just say it like this God
[18:19] don't call Gentiles by a
[18:22] group he calls us
[18:26] individually because every body come to
[18:29] this
[18:30] church doesn't mean they're
[18:33] bride I hope and trust we
[18:36] are y understand me I'd love to see
[18:39] every one of
[18:41] us over there Hallelujah but only God
[18:46] knows Hallelujah huj listen what the
[18:49] prophet said paragraph
[18:51] 116 coming from the six
[18:54] seal he said
[18:57] Remember the deals with Israel as a
[19:00] nation
[19:02] always is the nation of Israel now
[19:06] remember I'm saying this now when it
[19:08] came to Jacob's
[19:11] trouble when Jacob had to meet
[19:14] Esau the first thing Jacob wanted to
[19:17] do with Esau is make a monetary
[19:22] Covenant
[19:26] Hallelujah make a monetary
[19:29] Covenant and and and of course
[19:33] Esau says it's not
[19:36] necessary Hallelujah but look at them
[19:38] they fighting
[19:40] today hallelujah hallelujah and so with
[19:43] the
[19:43] Jews because they are under that
[19:47] inspiration they're going to make a
[19:49] covenant with Esau
[19:52] Rome but Rome is going to break the
[19:56] Covenant Hallelujah
[19:58] you got to understand because if they're
[20:00] going to move into the digital aspect of
[20:03] it they're not going to need
[20:05] dollars Hallelujah and Wall Street
[20:09] Jews they got all the
[20:11] dollars I might get in trouble but the
[20:14] truth of the matter is you need to
[20:17] know what that was happening
[20:20] now over there in
[20:23] Israel is gathering the real
[20:26] Jews back to their home
[20:30] land Hallelujah it is
[20:33] war and
[20:35] persecution that brought the Jews from
[20:38] under Hitler Stalin and
[20:40] melini and brought them back to Israel
[20:44] Hallelujah it will be the
[20:47] persecution that will bring the Bride of
[20:49] Jesus Christ together Hallelujah and
[20:53] it's
[20:54] persecution right now that's
[20:56] strengthening the Jew
[21:00] it's not designed to weaken them it is
[21:03] designed to strengthen them
[21:06] Hallelujah right I heard Netanyahu say
[21:11] we don't have to depend on America
[21:14] Hallelujah we are going to depend on
[21:17] God hallelujah you see and that's the
[21:21] Christian that's why we're made in the
[21:24] same
[21:25] likeness we're not depending on nobody
[21:29] but Jesus Christ Hallelujah remember
[21:33] what your lord said he said conceal the
[21:36] lies of the
[21:39] family he said I clothe them hallelujah
[21:43] what about The
[21:44] Sparrows I feed them Hallelujah and he
[21:48] said
[21:50] likewise you are my children take no
[21:53] thought for
[21:55] tomorrow for tomorrow is evil of itself
[21:59] Hallelujah we don't have to worry about
[22:02] tomorrow because we've got Jesus Christ
[22:06] today and if you got him
[22:09] today you'll have him
[22:11] tomorrow Hallelujah the Gentiles excuse
[22:15] me as
[22:17] individuals excuse me people taken from
[22:20] the
[22:23] Gentiles and it had to the Gentiles had
[22:27] to make make up all the people of the
[22:34] world so now then there's a Jew there
[22:38] Jews come into
[22:40] that but let me pause for a
[22:43] moment so that you can understand our
[22:46] country can only what do what the
[22:48] scriptures have already said they were
[22:50] going to
[22:51] do the B said all the Gentile
[22:54] Nations will be against Israel
[22:58] Hallelujah and that includes
[23:01] America hallelujah hallelujah but the
[23:03] prophet of God also said one of the
[23:06] worst things we could do could have
[23:09] done was join alliance with the uh uh
[23:14] uh uh Palestinian Iraqis or how he the
[23:18] Muslim let's say it like that that's one
[23:20] of the worst things we could have
[23:22] done hallelujah so what am I saying
[23:26] judgment is right at the door
[23:30] whether you like it or
[23:35] not you love the
[23:38] Lord let me move
[23:41] on just like
[23:44] Arabians and and arish Irish and Indians
[23:49] and what more is all the people of the
[23:51] world make up bouquet bouquet BR see
[23:59] but now when it comes to dealing with
[24:01] the then dealing then with
[24:04] Israel in this last part of the 70th
[24:08] week it deals with them as a
[24:12] nation the Gentiles are
[24:15] finished the hour is soon
[24:18] arriving and maybe yet this this is very
[24:22] nice that God would completely turn from
[24:25] the Gentiles all
[24:27] together exactly he said
[24:30] so they shall tread Down the Walls of
[24:33] Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation
[24:36] be
[24:37] finished the times are over yes sir and
[24:41] then let then let him that is filthy
[24:45] stay
[24:47] filthy let him that is righteous be
[24:51] righteous see that's where we are when
[24:54] God is calling and trying to woo us see
[24:58] he's a just God it's always warning
[25:01] before
[25:03] judgment Hallelujah you love the Lord
[25:06] and yes during the
[25:09] seal when that Sixth
[25:11] Seal when it unfolds in the way that it
[25:15] should when the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[25:18] gone there is no blood on the mercy
[25:23] seat right now we're covered by the
[25:26] blood God that blood protects
[25:29] us from the Judgment of
[25:32] God hallelujah hallelujah see we don't
[25:35] want to
[25:36] wait you miss the Rapture there is no
[25:39] blood to protect
[25:42] you you got to
[25:44] suffer and if I got it right the prophet
[25:48] of God said what Hitler did to the
[25:52] Jews will be like a
[25:56] picnic compared
[25:59] to what the people left behind will
[26:03] suffer now I just paraphrase
[26:06] that there is no more blood on the
[26:09] seat in the sanctuary at all there's no
[26:13] more blood on the on the
[26:15] altar the sacrifice has been
[26:18] removed and there's nothing but smoke
[26:20] and lightning and judgment in
[26:23] there and that's just exactly was poured
[26:27] out here tonight
[26:30] see the lamb has done left his mediatory
[26:34] work the mediatory work has been
[26:37] finished from over on the
[26:41] throne the Safa is we've typed him
[26:45] perfectly the kingsom
[26:48] Redeemer the bloody lamb that
[26:52] come a lamb that has been
[26:56] slain a bloody one been killed
[26:59] K
[27:01] bruised come forth and took the book out
[27:03] of his
[27:05] hand that's the day day that's the days
[27:09] are
[27:11] finished now he is coming to
[27:14] claim what he has
[27:16] redeemed amen that just sends something
[27:20] through me Hallelujah we find out now
[27:25] John said I beheld
[27:28] when he had opened the Sixth Seal and
[27:31] there was a great
[27:32] earthquake in all
[27:35] nature God has been doing great
[27:39] things yes then all nature was
[27:41] interrupted yes thank you
[27:43] brother God has been doing great things
[27:47] like Healing The
[27:48] Sick opening the eyes of the Blind and
[27:51] doing great works but we find out here

[31:33] the Beast and and the mark of the beast
[31:37] and you somebody walk in you say did you
[31:40] hear
[31:42] that you

[32:03] Great
[32:04] Tribulation except they repent of their
[32:09] deeds and you know they're not going to
[32:12] repent because God said he gave her
[32:14] space to
[32:15] repent and she would
[32:18] not and I would kill her children with
[32:21] death and all the churches shall know
[32:24] that I am he which searches the RS of
[32:27] the heart you hear what I'm saying he
[32:29] said they'll know I know what's in your
[32:32] heart and I will give un to every one of
[32:35] you according to your Works Hallelujah
[32:39] is that right I want to say people say
[32:42] well how come the Jews is the way they
[32:44] are they can't
[32:46] help that's their anointing
[32:49] i49 2
[32:51] 42 they got Jacob's anointing Hallelujah
[32:56] and that's the reason men act that
[32:59] way because that Spirit that's predicted
[33:02] for that age to be on them they can't do
[33:06] nothing
[33:08] else Hallelujah y'all understand me I'm
[33:11] not going to be too much longer but I
[33:14] want you to understand people don't
[33:16] understand the Jew was a
[33:20] Shyer and he will remain a sha until he
[33:23] get filled with the Holy
[33:25] Ghost he's got that Jacob anointing
[33:29] that's the spirit that is Forever on
[33:31] this you even to this day but because we
[33:35] are
[33:35] Christian we know in spite of their
[33:39] condition they were blinded that we
[33:42] might come in you understand me thank
[33:45] God for his
[33:47] grace thank God for the purpose of God
[33:51] they were blinded for us and we're know
[33:54] better
[33:55] Hallelujah matter of fact the Jews
[33:58] they are considered the sons of
[34:00] God hallelujah as Israel was the son so
[34:06] amen so are their
[34:08] sons
[34:10] Hallelujah yes sir he will do anything
[34:13] y'all know that's how they get wealthy
[34:16] because they do anything to
[34:18] get they love that
[34:22] money and people get jealous of them
[34:25] because they're very skilled at it
[34:29] Hallelujah but God made him that
[34:33] way Hallelujah huj now the the truth of
[34:36] the matter is we can't act like this is
[34:39] the first time they've been
[34:41] persecuted they were persecuted
[34:43] throughout all history Hallelujah but
[34:46] the great this persecution has come upon
[34:50] them because they failed to see their
[34:54] Messiah and When They Crucified him
[34:57] they said let his blood be on
[35:00] us and our
[35:02] children and they have been suffering
[35:04] every
[35:06] sin no matter where they
[35:09] go Hallelujah they they they sought
[35:15] out because of what they
[35:20] said they are still
[35:23] suffering Hallelujah but they're coming
[35:25] a day
[35:28] hallelujah amen even under that six year
[35:31] they come in a
[35:33] day when the Jews were wake up to the
[35:37] Messiah
[35:38] Hallelujah and the Bible says in one
[35:42] day one day they will be filled with the
[35:45] Holy Ghost Hallelujah see they already
[35:50] Sanctified glory to God and God is going
[35:53] to fill
[35:55] them hallelujah hallelujah yes sir
[35:59] that's why the Bible said there we they
[36:00] will do
[36:02] exploits they run through the
[36:04] troops y'all hear what I'm saying said
[36:07] that scripture refers to the
[36:10] Jew Hallelujah they won't be able to
[36:12] contain
[36:15] them and then when they die it's because
[36:18] God gave them Grace to do
[36:20] it to do what fulfill the
[36:24] scriptures Hallelujah but won't they be
[36:29] surprised when they see see them same
[36:33] Jews come back for the
[36:36] [Music]
[36:39] Millennium Hallelujah that's what he
[36:41] said in the six he said there'll be
[36:43] there at the Millennium so it be a
[36:45] little short quick
[36:48] work up and
[36:51] down Hallelujah is that right now I'm
[36:55] going to uh pair pH a few more
[36:58] I'm going to say a few more let's just
[37:00] think about
[37:03] Egypt and
[37:05] Moses and
[37:07] remember everyone who did not obey Moses
[37:11] the words of
[37:13] Moses they
[37:15] perished because they failed to see it
[37:17] wasn't
[37:18] Moses it was God veiled in
[37:22] Moses God and God told Moses you will
[37:26] become God to pH
[37:29] did it
[37:30] happen it
[37:32] happened Hallelujah but in all
[37:36] exoduses you have a mixed
[37:41] multitude I was thinking about this the
[37:44] other day when I was
[37:46] studying I said don't you
[37:49] know Joshua and
[37:51] Caleb out of
[37:53] millions were the only
[37:55] ones of that
[37:58] generation that received the Holy
[38:01] Ghost is that right now that new
[38:05] generation that was circumcised
[38:09] again they crossed over into
[38:16] Canaan Canan represented the Holy
[38:20] Ghost say Canan was not a represent
[38:23] represented heaven
[38:27] because there's no no fighting and no
[38:29] suffering in
[38:32] heaven but they were in the in the in
[38:34] the land of the Holy
[38:36] Ghost and in the land of the Holy Ghost
[38:40] it was Battle after battle after battle
[38:42] after battle and as long as they kept
[38:45] seeing out of the camp they were
[38:49] victorious over the enemy hallelujah
[38:53] hallelujah amen amen and even when they
[38:56] made mistakes God gave them space to
[38:59] repent and they did repent y'all hear
[39:03] what I'm saying but think about this
[39:08] two out of all those
[39:11] people it makes you
[39:14] wonder how many people who followed
[39:16] William
[39:17] brandom actually had
[39:20] it if you listen to the T you you you
[39:24] read between the line there was a lot of
[39:26] people Church go us there was a lot of
[39:29] people who believe he was a
[39:32] prophet but they had a hard
[39:35] time believing that the Holy Ghost was
[39:37] not speaking in
[39:39] tongu they had a hard time believing
[39:43] that they had to go further than
[39:45] that Hallelujah they had a hard
[39:49] time Hallelujah believing that women
[39:52] weren't supposed to preach you hear what
[39:55] I'm saying but yet they had the holy
[39:58] ghost hallelujah hallelujah they has
[40:01] something but the Holy Ghost never
[40:04] denies his
[40:06] word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[40:11] [Music]
[40:13] hallelujah
[40:16] never
[40:18] Hallelujah glory to
[40:22] God in that
[40:24] time Pharaoh was killing the babies
[40:29] trying to stop the Royal
[40:32] seed that's what this all about you
[40:35] know
[40:37] hallelujah hallelujah they were trying
[40:40] to
[40:41] stop the Israelites from
[40:45] multiplying and becoming greater in
[40:49] number is that what not what they doing
[40:52] now Hallelujah are you talking about
[40:54] what you talking about brother you got
[40:57] realized this message have been
[41:01] infiltrated Hallelujah it is a known
[41:05] fact that there were Catholic
[41:07] priests who were Pastors in a foreign
[41:12] country then when they all start leaving
[41:15] the
[41:15] message these these priests went back to
[41:18] the Catholic
[41:20] church what do you think they went back
[41:24] with they know everything
[41:28] except the Holy
[41:30] Ghost that's the that's the
[41:32] danger of having an intellectual
[41:35] message Hallelujah there nothing wrong
[41:38] with having an in but we need the power
[41:41] of the Holy
[41:43] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah amen I'm not
[41:47] interested I'm not interested in in all
[41:50] the
[41:51] healing those things are great I won't
[41:54] change
[41:58] more than anywhere else give me
[42:02] change hallelujah hallelujah I done seen
[42:05] Miracles I've seen signs I've seen
[42:08] wonders I've seen people speak in
[42:11] tongues and shout and dance but this
[42:14] message came to change us from glory to
[42:18] Glory Hallelujah little by little step
[42:22] by step virtue by virtue into the statue
[42:27] of a perfect
[42:29] man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[42:32] it's not time to be Side
[42:37] Track Hallelujah keep your eyes on
[42:40] Jesus because when the Storm come if you
[42:43] look around like Peter you going to
[42:48] S Egypt would plague with all kind of
[42:51] plagues and the world is being plagued
[42:53] with all kinds of
[42:55] plages Hallelujah and all these plagues
[42:58] were
[43:00] announcing they're coming an
[43:03] exodus all these plagues were
[43:07] announcing and
[43:09] pointing to the end of
[43:13] Egypt all these
[43:16] plagues are
[43:18] pointing to the end of this
[43:21] world Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[43:24] fall of Egypt was rise of the
[43:28] church being led by a
[43:31] prophet and the pill of fire or should I
[43:35] say the pill of
[43:36] fire and the prophet however you want to
[43:39] say it the safety zone was given to him
[43:43] to give to the
[43:45] people and that safety zone consisted of
[43:48] the
[43:49] blood put the blood on the doorpost and
[43:52] the
[43:53] L Hallelujah but you see that wasn't all
[43:58] they had to be tried with that was just
[44:01] justification God sent them in the
[44:03] wilderness to be
[44:06] Sanctified Hallelujah is that right and
[44:09] you'll find out in in the wilderness
[44:12] those may have been
[44:14] Sanctified lost their
[44:17] sanctification because of the teachings
[44:19] of Dayan and
[44:21] Kora Hallelujah and that's the truth oh
[44:25] you're the message you're the bride you
[44:28] know you you all right Grace is with you
[44:32] yes Grace is with you but God expect you
[44:36] to respect his word we're not just
[44:39] hearers of the word but we must be doers
[44:41] of the word even if James have
[44:46] said I'm sorry don't mean to go too fast
[44:48] so fast brother I'm just a little
[44:51] excited Millions died in the
[44:55] wilderness Joshua and Caleb made over to
[44:57] the
[44:59] promised the promised land represented
[45:01] as I
[45:02] said was a representative of heaven but
[45:05] it was on the Holy
[45:06] Ghost Hallelujah is that right
[45:09] Deuteronomy 8
[45:11] 1-4 and I guess I close on this
[45:13] scripture
[45:15] here well I have one
[45:21] more
[45:24] Deuteronomy 1-4
[45:29] and the Commandments which I command
[45:31] thee this day shall ye observe to
[45:37] do that you may live and multiply and go
[45:41] in and possess the land which the Lord
[45:43] swear unto your
[45:50] father and thou sh remember all the ways
[45:54] which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40
[45:56] years years in the
[46:03] wilderness why did he do
[46:05] that to Humble
[46:07] thee and to prove thee and to know what
[46:12] was in thine
[46:14] heart whether thou would keep his
[46:17] Commandments or
[46:19] no all these
[46:22] test all these trials are there to prove
[46:26] what's in your heart
[46:28] see whether you going to keep his
[46:31] Commandments and he humbled thee and
[46:35] suffered thee to
[46:37] hunger and fed thee with
[46:40] manner which thou knewest
[46:43] not neither did thy fathers know that he
[46:47] may make thee know that man does not
[46:50] live by bread
[46:51] only but but by every word that
[46:55] proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord
[46:58] do man
[47:00] live he goes on to say that th th th thy
[47:03] rment waxs not old upon
[47:06] thee neither did thy foot
[47:13] swell these 40
[47:17] years huh all those
[47:21] blessings and yet they were
[47:24] lost because
[47:27] they failed to keep his
[47:29] word this is our
[47:31] opportunity God always give us space to
[47:35] repent Hallelujah it ain't all
[47:38] over first Peter 4- 4 12 17 I trust you
[47:44] being
[47:47] blessed I you know what I I say I say

[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:18] brother God bless yall um I just have a
[1:03:22] testimony because I learned that when
[1:03:24] God does something good you you have to
[1:03:26] give him the praise amen um
[1:03:29] so I'm currently in school for like an
[1:03:32] Accel accelerated program so like that
[1:03:36] program like I go at my own pace but
[1:03:38] then the school has a policy that you
[1:03:40] cannot drop a class twice if you drop a
[1:03:44] class twice then um like you you pretty
[1:03:48] much will be out of the school you
[1:03:50] cannot register for that class anymore
[1:03:52] so there was this one class that was
[1:03:53] very important
[1:03:57] and I
[1:04:02] procrastinated and then and then I
[1:04:04] didn't take it too seriously so that
[1:04:06] they dropped it the first
[1:04:10] time because like polic where if you
[1:04:12] don't submit an assment after C am
[1:04:15] amount of days they
[1:04:23] CL they Dr the CL first
[1:04:27] time I still had one more chance you got
[1:04:31] class got to get
[1:04:33] dropped maximum
[1:04:36] isce
[1:04:41] the and then we went to the wedding in
[1:04:44] m and then I got so busy I didn't get
[1:04:47] the time to submit my
[1:04:50] assment and they dropped my class again
[1:04:55] I felt like I already knew that I
[1:04:58] couldn't register for that
[1:05:03] class
[1:05:11] ieda so that really discouraged me
[1:05:13] because I've been putting a lot of work
[1:05:15] to trying to get down with all my
[1:05:17] courses by the end of this month and
[1:05:27] just a
[1:05:28] little
[1:05:31] aot I really felt like like what is
[1:05:34] going on with me why can't I just like
[1:05:37] finish this like why why couldn't like I
[1:05:40] felt really really
[1:05:42] bad so I was I've been at church I spent
[1:05:45] the last two days here at
[1:05:49] church and I just felt I I this is just
[1:05:54] an encouragement everyone because when
[1:05:57] the Bible tells you when Jesus tells you
[1:05:59] that anything you ask in his name he'll
[1:06:01] give it to you that's the
[1:06:12] truth so like God just started bringing
[1:06:15] scures to my
[1:06:19] mind you know and you believe in your
[1:06:22] heart you will be mov
[1:06:26] and then God told me why C
[1:06:30] speak I was here on and I
[1:06:34] pray and then I reminded God of his
[1:06:37] promises and I told him
[1:06:39] that I believe he can even create that
[1:06:43] class for me in the
[1:06:48] system because I remember the prophet
[1:06:50] says that like something like if I have
[1:06:53] a knife and I lost a knife I
[1:07:04] pocket so the class guy dropped May 6
[1:07:07] and then it took like almost six six or
[1:07:10] seven days there was still no like that
[1:07:13] class was not even visible on the system
[1:07:15] you couldn't even sign up
[1:07:27] so after I prayed I I finished praying
[1:07:30] and I spoke and I said that in the name
[1:07:32] of Jesus
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:44] Christ just on
[1:07:48] mygot
[1:07:50] day I was church here evening I actually
[1:07:54] remember I was about the class let me
[1:08:00] check and then when I open the
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:08] system there and I was
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:20] just just an
[1:08:22] encouragement with the sermon today to
[1:08:24] like pray
[1:08:28] my issue was the class but you may have
[1:08:30] something else you
[1:08:46] [Applause]
