Lord again this morning amen amen where else would you rather be amen amen are you washed in the blood of the Lamb amen I have preached I love that song even a man let's just open our Bibles up to the book of Acts well Acts chapter 2 we'll start with the first verse a man if we were washed in the blood of the Lamb we were washed for a purpose amen let's discover that purpose this morning amen speak a message called do you now believe Amen Acts chapter 2 we'll start with the first verse and it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and have filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and is set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance amen else go down to verse eight says and now how we hear every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and li mites and dwellers of mesopotamia and judea cappadocia and contests in Asia Phrygia and Pamphylia and the egypt and in parts of Libya and Cyrene and the strangers of Rome and Jews and proselytes Crete's and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God and they are all amazed and we're in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this a man let's go down to the 16th verse mrs. Peter speaking he says but this is that which was spoken of by the Prophet Joel that shall come to pass in the last days saith God now pour out of my spirit all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and on my handmaidens will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy a man let's just bow our heads and word prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for for your message father for for what you have spoken unto us Lord and the gospel or that you've given them to us Lord Lord knowing that you have a great purpose Lord and everything that you have done father and every single scripture Lord and and how you have gathered us and drawn us together in this room even this morning Lord and Lord it into that purpose Lord we submit ourselves father or whatever it is that you have a desire Lord to do in our lives father we just open up our hearts right now in the name of Jesus Christ Lord though there's there's no greater privilege that mortal ever had then to close his eyes and to open this heart Lord and to speak to you father and all we pray that right now this morning Lord that you would speak back to us and Lord out of your word in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen you know everything that God does he does it for a purpose you know there is there is nothing that that whenever if God when God sets a chain of events in motion he sets that chain of events into motion for a purpose amen and he always has a goal in mind at the end of that chain of events amen so everything that God does he does it with a certainty he doesn't in faith he knows exactly why he's doing it he knows what his actions will cause when he does them amen because God knows the end from the beginning amen so whenever God does something he can look down throughout time and he knows before he does something exactly whatever it is that he does he knows exactly what will happen in reaction to his action that he does amen so in God forms an action upon the earth that action has certain consequences certain rewards certain things that will benefits to those actions and those that can enter into his word upon the earth will become beneficiaries of those actions amen because you and you find yourself inside of the vision amen inside of whatever it is that God has in his mind well he hadn't in his thinking before the foundation of the world when you find yourself inside of that book inside of that vision amen then you're in a good place amen because you're in a good place because you are no longer just living the natural life of what your your parents thought that you would live when you were born upon this earth but now you are living a supernatural life amen that didn't come from your parents but a supernatural life the cave from your heavenly father which is in heaven amen and this supernatural life is endowed upon you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that when a man has been completely his god remember God's throughout history has been choosing Tabernacles to dwell in amen when he chose the Garden of Eden to dwell in back in the beginning that was his pattern that God will dwell with his people that he will walk with them and he will talk with them amen and when he talks with him he will there will be peace in the land amen and they'll then know that communion takes place in a garden that garden and that communion takes place in a place of tranquility a place of rest a place where God is in control amen it takes place in a garden and that that pattern has never changed now communion still takes place in a garden a place where the fruits all the precious fruits of all the earth that have been gathered from far-off places are gathered together one place a gardener when he when he when a man decides that he's going to create a garden he doesn't just plant things at random but he plants things with a purpose because he knows what fruits he wants to bear from that garden and he only and when he plants something he plants something where the one fruit will be complementary to the other fruit amen and if there is a fruit that he doesn't want in his garden he doesn't plant it there so that there will be some fruits that are sealed out of the garden and there'll be some fruits there sealed into the garden a man so it is with every garden that God has created when he has filled the man with the Holy Ghost he has now chosen you to be his garden it is like you're in the Garden of Eden like it was back before the fall amen where there are certain fruits that God has in his mind before the foundation of the world that he is for ordain those fruits to grow up in your life through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen your your foreordained to this your the whole purpose that you were here is that those fruits might live in your life amen if we miss that we missed the whole reason we're here in the first place amen because we are put here to commune with God amen I want to preach this morning a message called do you now believe amen like I said everything has been done for a purpose when God chose his Tabernacles throughout history I may chose the Garden of Eden and he chose the Tabernacle in the wilderness and they chose Solomon's Temple he always gave an evidence that that was his chosen temple amen and the evidence of his chosen temple was that God Himself showed up on the scene amen the evidence of God's chosen temple was that God Himself showed up on the scene on the inside of that temple amen we've seen you know God walked and talked with him in the cool of the day we've seen God fill the place with a pillar of fire coming down over the temple we saw him fill it with a pillar of cloud so that they couldn't even see down on the inside amen they wash the presence of God moving across the desert and come and fill this place amen and and and there's a you know if you remember the story of Joshua when Joshua was just a young man and he had been inspired by this man Moses and he began to realize that this man Moses was a prophet and Joshua settled it in his heart that everything that Moses said he was going to believe a man because he realized that Moses was a chosen vessel of God and that his words were worth listening to so Joshua made a wise decision and decided to be obedient to the very thing that Moses was looking at and Moses was looking at a pillar of fire a pillar of cloud and Moses was looking at a God that had met him in in a burning bush and Moses always had his face towards that pillar fire he had his face towards that burning bush and wherever that burning bush with a fire that was in that bush went Moses with that direction and when the voice said do this Moses was obedient to that voice and so Joshua when he saw that he had respect unto it Amen and when they win and when Moses was grieved about the sins that the people had done he took the tabernacle and he took the tent and he removed it out of the camp and put it up upon the hill outside of the camp and because Mo's or because Joshua had such a respect he says if they if God if the tabernacle of God is leaving the camp then I must also leave the camp right so while all the children of Israel stayed behind in their tent door Joshua walks out of the camp and goes to where Moses had pitched the tabernacle outside of the camp and he sat there and he went on the inside and no one could convince him to come out amen no one could convince him to come out and they'd all sudden the presence of the Lord God comes down and fills the tabernacle that has been outside of the camp and remember the story how all that sugar of Israel they walked and they stood at their tent door and worshiped from a distance but Joshua was a satisfied to worship from a distance he wanted to be down on the inside of the tabernacle where God was meeting his people amen so he wasn't satisfied just to worship God from a distance he wasn't satisfied to worship God from a cold heart he wasn't satisfied to worship God out of just traditions of man or on the inside or from the and from his the house of his door but no he was gonna worship God where God in a place that God had chosen a place where God has chosen to put his name amen and so so he removed himself wherever the presence of God was going to show up Joshua wanted to be right there amen and God is always going to show up where his word is being revered God is always going to show up where his word has the preeminence God will always show up on the scene where our people love him worship Him and follow after his word amen so when it comes down to the book of Acts they were they had heard the Word of God they had respects under the Word of God the word of what God had become flesh and they handled him a mint and when the Word of God when that tabernacle of flesh ascended up onto God he said wait here in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen so they saw they when they when they caught the revelation the Ono's when those apostles caught the revelation that this Jesus Christ is the tabernacle of the Living God dwelling place this is the living tabernacle where the Living God is dwelling this is this tabernacle called the Lord Jesus Christ is the it is the is the the fullness of the Godhead bodily amen that they left everything behind it said they left all they sold all that they had they got Li they left their houses behind if they are plowing they just walked up and left if they are fishing they threw down their nets and left amen and they did the same thing that Joshua did back there they saw the tabernacle the living God's dwelling place and they followed it for three and a half years everywhere it goes everywhere I went a man just like Joshua back in the Old Testament now they have discovered another tabernacle another place where the Living God is dwelling another place where the Spirit of God has now visited them once more and they're going to now follow him they leave every single thing behind and they say wherever he goes I will follow amen and there anyway I was a wise decision a man that decision had benefits that decision that they made paid off amen there were benefits that they reaped now when they are going through all the struggles of following this Jesus Christ there were some hard times there was a lot of persecution they meant there was times that Jesus said things that they did not understand there was times that they could not explain his doctrine there are times that they had to accept his doctrine even when everybody else said that's ridiculous and they themselves didn't fully understand it but they had to accept it anyway so when Jesus said well you have to eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood they didn't necessarily understand that but they had to receive it amen and because they had seen the signs of the the Living God dwelling on the inside of this tabernacle they said I don't care what comes out of his mouth I'm gonna believe what it is and because they had respects unto that Tabernacle there those respects paid off because they realized that God had visited them again a living Tabernacle upon the earth once more now they had grown up in church they had seen synagogues and churches that had the name of Jehovah over them there there were Scrolls down in the inside of those synagogues that were written by Moses there are scrolls that were faithfully copied on down down through history amen so they could solace to say the Word of God was on the inside of that synagogue or the Word of God was on the inside of that temple but here when the Word of God came down in the flesh they wrecked is that this is the same thing as that scroll only this is now God alive in a living Tabernacle amen and so they began to pay respect what just more respect under that then even the temple itself because Jesus said this will be cast down but this body of mine though be cast down I will rebuild it in three days and they began to work a CH the revelation that this is the tabernacle the living tabernacle of the Living God slowly place and though they followed it they followed it they followed it and one day when that Tabernacle started lifting up off the earth and as he spoke to him he said wait here until you be endued with power from on high amen so as they were ascending he was ascending up and all sudden the clouds covered him and all suddenly an angel stood there and said unto him why are you looking up into the clouds he will come again just like you saw him ascending he will decent but until then remember everything that he said to do and do it amen and so where they went to and they went and they were faithfully he's saying one of the things he said was wait here until you be endued with power from on high and so when they got into the upper room on the day of Pentecost they were waiting up there because they had a promise and that same simple that they had followed they were now sudden their temple had left them they were left without the temple where is the place where the Living God's dwelling place is going to be they couldn't go back to that just go back to the temple that Jesus said this will be torn down they couldn't go back to the synagogue there so only thing they could do is to rest upon the promise that was given to them amen they were given a word to wait right here just wait right here until the promise of the Father comes to you and you will be endued with power from on high so as long as they so we're sitting there in the upper room and they look down themselves and as long as they could say I'm in dude with power from down low then they knew that they didn't have what they were looking for you Amen and so it is with every one of us if we are in dude with the power from our own flesh if we're in dude with the power from our own heart or in dude it's the power of our own physical nature then we know we haven't found what we're looking for you amen but if wherever we get to the point where we can honestly say that we've been in dude as power from on high then we know that we have gotten to where we need to be amen because we are waiting all of us have to come to the place to where we know the the tabernacle of God is with men amen where God has a desire to live in his people still a man just like Joshua had respect unto the Tabernacle in the wilderness and wherever it went he went with it they meant because he was going to be where that pillar fire was so did these men in the upper room they had respect unto the word and they waited there until they became the living Tabernacle of the Living God dwelling place ain't no longer was it the the pillar of fire coming down upon a natural building or a tent in the wilderness but now the pillar of fire came down upon their heads amen and they looked around and there was tongues of fire up over their heads and now it was no longer just a physical tit but they began to catch the revelation that the Holy Spirit of the Living God the same one that visited them in the Garden of Eden the same one the visitor Tamarack in the wilderness the same one that visited Solomon's Temple has now visited this temple and now they believe amen now this when this happened it caused that when they were filled what happens it says not only did the pillar of fire had heft headship over them sure that he had leadership over them by and by by putting that pillar fire over their heads but he also came down on the inside of them and filled them and filled them until they were full a man he didn't say they he halfway filled them he didn't say that he partway filled them but he said that he filled them until they were full they were filled with the Holy Ghost amen and because they are filled with the Holy Ghost it caused something to happen in them amen that says that they began to prophesy they began to speak in tongues and when they began to speak in tongues no matter what language anybody was around them hurt they began hearing him in their own language and what they heard the words that they heard were speak that says that they we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God amen so not only did they know what the wonderful works of God they were able to express them out of their mouth amen so some of us to say that we're filled with the Holy Ghost would be hard-pressed to explain what the wonderful works of God in our life now if we were to come out and and have a little question here what are the wonderful works of God in your life some of us would struggle to be able to elevate anything that God is currently doing in our lives amen but yet we say that we're the living tabernacle of the Living God swelling place Amen God has come down to dwell in his bride God has come to down to dwell on the inside of his bride is as brother Branham gave a gave a a parable about a about a woman that was a orphan and she lived on a cattle ranch out there in Colorado and this ranch was owned by a rich man up in Chicago and as the the the man in Chicago had a son Amen and he and and and this rich man wanted his son to have a proper wife and and the man was looking for a proper bride and we looked around the civilization he looked upon the greatest women that mankind could provide and he couldn't find anything that he wanted to marry and so he said I'm going to go down to the my my father's ranch down there in Colorado I'm going to look for a bride they is the very essence of what a woman's character ought to be a man where it is a God designed in the beginning for that essence for that woman that certain characteristics that that woman's supposed to have I'm gonna go down and I'm looking for that and when I find it then that is the woman that I will take to be my bride amen so when he went down there there was a lot away when they were trying to breathe the bride of this man amen they were trying they were they were dancing in their own spirit amen they were speaking words out of their own mouth in their own out of their own nature they were trying to impress this man amen they were doing things out of their own mind whatever came to their own mind that they thought would impress this man is looking for a bride a man but there's another woman who didn't have to try to impress this man she just had to be the characteristic of what she was a man so she wasn't trying to impress the man she was just being what she was amen because of the fruits that were down on the inside of her life amen and when he began to observe he looked at all the women that were had they were trying to be something and he says that is not where less what that looks like what I came out of and I'm not here for what I came out of I'm here for something as god-given amen and that's the type of bride that he is looking for amen and that's the same type of right that Christ is looking for he's not looking for something that comes out of our own nature he's not looking for something that we can do have our own strengths he's not looking for something that we can do out of our own might our own reasoning our own thinking our own strength but he's looking for a fruit that can only come by being the tabernacle of the Living God dwelling place amen when you become the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place that is what Christ is looking for a man he's going to leave glory and come down to earth amen and he isn't looking for a bride amen and he is good to choose this bride he's looking for certain characteristics and those characteristics are the same thing that he planted back in the beginning when he spoke his word amen and there are many of they're gonna try to impress him amen they will dance in the spirit they will speak with tongues they will do open they'll call him Lord Lord and they will worship him they'll say we've done many mighty works we've we've found out the trick to using your spirit we can on our flesh you know and we found out how to how to manipulate your spirit or to make use of your resources right they've done amen but there is a certain characteristic that he's looking for as something that he planted in the word in the world back before the foundation of the world amen and when you and when is his own word it is his own seat amen and so when that seed begins to grow in you then what do you do you have respect unto that seat amen why because in the evening time it shall be like amen and that light has come to manifest a seed that is down on the inside amen and that seed will love only the Word of God amen and it won't won't that seed will not have will not be a show off amen that seed will not be a it won't be trying to do things out of your own nature of your own power amen there's something about that seed of God that knows that it can only act by the Holy Spirit of the Living up amen the acts that's why this where we read the Acts of the Apostles it was not their own natural acts is the acts of their of the Holy Spirit down on the inside was acting and doing things amen hey and when Peter he began to explain it to the people to the crowd he said this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and we shall come to pass in the last days saith God that I'll pour out on my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams now how were these prophecies dreams and visions going to come to pass by this spirit of the Living God what are dreams and visions and prophecies they're the language of heaven amen and in order to speak the language of heaven you got to have the Holy Ghost on the inside amen so so what is it when the naiton when the Holy Spirit of Living God fills a person they begin doing things that come from heaven amen their actions come from heaven well why because though the very nature of heaven is down on the inside amen they're alert they're now a depository they're a temple they're a tabernacle there's not filled with their own natural spirit that's polluted but they've been washed in the blood of the Lamb to make way for the Holy Spirit which is God Himself that is not from this world but it's from heaven and once they are filled with that natural spirit or with that Holy Spirit then their actions become not natural actions but heavenly actions because they have been filled with the Living God amen do you now believe that's why we are washed with the blood of the Lamb because the blood of the Lamb is paving the way for the very end welling of the Holy Ghost the reason that we came and we were washed by the blood of the Lamb is so that we could be filled with the Holy Ghost that's the whole purpose for what we are here so we could be filled with the Holy Ghost if we miss that we miss everything if we miss that we miss everything amen the Holy Spirit gave them utterance because it was like a well springing up down within their soul amen and that well he's Jesus if you drink of this water you will never thirst again amen amen amen let's turn to John chapter 16 we'll read from the 23rd verse of John 16 and it says and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he will give it you hey there - have you asked nothing in my name ask and he shall receive that your joy may be full these things I have spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I'll show you plainly of the father and at that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you for the father himself love with you and because he have loved me and believed that come out from God and I came forth from the father and I'm come into the world and again I leave the world and going to the father what's he telling you he's telling you this Tabernacle that you see here you believe that this Tabernacle was though father coming down in the flesh right you believe that I had was the followers of me and the flowers and the father because of this faith they meant because you have believed this amen now all the father himself the same Holy Spirit that is filled me will now come and fill you amen and not that I will pray to the Father for the father the Holy Spirit Himself loves you and will come and dwell inside of you a man he says I came forth from the father verse 28 I came and come into the world and again I leave the world and go to the Father now when he leaves the world where is the Living Tabernacle of the Living God willing place is going to be well it's that vessel the vessel Lord Jesus Christ leaves a swirl where will God's Tabernacle be but a body has sow prepared for says the Psalms a body has sound prepared for me Amen God has prepared a body a bride for Christ for the Holy Spirit the anointing to live in amen and his disciples said in verse 29 lo now speak us out plainly and speakest no proverb now we are sure that thou knowest all things and I mean it's not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou cometh from the forth from God amen so now there that now there in Jesus said there in verse 31 do you now believe so now they got step one down they have recognized the tabernacle of God on the earth they got step one down that they've received the first step they've realized that the Lord Jesus Christ is the tabernacle of the Living God is dwelling place but God is not suppose it content just to leave it with that revelation he only wanted them to move forward from that revelation and that's why sending them just a little while longer wait here until you be endued with power from on high and Peter caught the revelation that this is the same thing that Joel spoke of where he said that the Spirit of God will be poured out on all flesh your sons and daughters will begin to speak heavenly language right amen why because they will now be the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place amen now let's turn back to John 16 we'll read from the or read from verse 19 now I remember here verse 20 and 21 are the same two verses that brother Branham was reading from when he is preaching the message birth pains Amen when he got up to the the platform when he was preaching the message birth pains he he got up to preach and to pages that he had a brand new Bible and two pages of his Bible were were stuck together and when he turned from from John 15 he turned over and he thought he was reading from John 16 because actually was reading from John 17 right and so and so he wasn't he got he was standing there on the platform he kept turning back and forth missing the page in between and and so so a Catholic priest stood up the bishop Stanley and he got up and and the he said a mazing thing I want to read what the what the Catholic priest said so when brother Bram is standing there a Catholic Archbishop priest the Rev William John s Stanley was he was on the platform behind brother Branham there and he realizes the brother Branham is struggling and so he walks up to him and he gives his Bible to brother Branham and he says this is what he says he says just just draw a dress this is bishops Bailey speaking he says just draw a breath there's a reason why it was done and you know it God will show you something to bring out of this that's wonderful something's going on now at least things don't happen for no reason amen these things don't happen for no reason and so what did brother Branham do when he took he took the scroll from the priest right amen he took the scroll from the priest and he can he read and he opens there and he reads verse 20 and verse 21 now we're going to read verses 19 through 21 here verses now Tina says but now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves that I said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me now you come to verse 20 this is what brother Branham read and the message birth pains out of the the Catholic priests Bible verily verily I say unto you they each shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and he shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy and a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more of the anguish for a joy that a man is born into the world a man so brother Branham preached the message birth pains using those two scriptures amen there's something getting ready to be born into the world amen there is something getting what is it Christ amen there's a message coming forth right amen and as Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen brother Branham was sent with a message to forerun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ they you're just as much as John the Baptist message was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ so your message be sent to forerun the second coming and so what so this messenger brother Brandon's standing on the stage he's preaching they say he's preaching this message birth pains he's saying you know he goes out these and then the next day he comes out and he's and he brings the revelation of it he says that this is just the same thing as it was back when Jesus took the scroll from the priest amen remember Jesus took the scroll from the priest in the synagogue he read Isaiah chapter 60 he read half of the prophecy and he left the other half for later amen because the other half of you fulfilled later and so when Jesus read he says the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to bind up the brokenhearted to set and Liberty those that are in captivity a and to loose those that are in Chains and the spirit Lord is upon me to preach the gospel to the poor hey man whoa and what was it it happened it wasn't just that he spoke it but then he happened the priest came he gave him the scroll he opened to the scroll and he says the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me and this is what it is to do and it happened amen we believed amen amen we believed it and now we don't have to be brokenhearted anymore Amen we don't have to be bound anymore a man we don't we've had the gospel preached to us amen so is it the same thing with this scripture here amen the whole world will be rejoicing and we will be sorrowful but our sorrow will be turned into joy why because a man-child is gonna be born on the earth Christ Himself the Living God the holy anointing of God is coming down on the inside of us filling us with the Holy Ghost and we're here not to live the manifestations of the past age amen amen now now there's this the age of Luther amen and we have not been called to be Lutheran's but we have been called to believe in justification amen so now the Lutheran age is going past and we're not in the Lutheran age anymore but we still believe in justification Amen we still have to be justified amen so now then the Wesleyan age came and he and sanctification Amen now we're not in the the we're not in the in the the Wesleyan age anymore but we still have to be sanctified so right we still have to be sanctified Amen so now we're that but that is not the focus of the age that's the ABCs they meant were to be going on to where the Christ child is to be born and so they not say meant amen so so then came the Pentecostal age with the restoration of the acts of the Holy Ghost right the Holy Spirit is now acting again in the church doing things that look like what was back in the beginning amen now we're not in the Pentecostal age anymore were in the bride age Amen but the bride age what what so we're not called to be Pentecostals by by denomination we've been called to come out of that but yet we still have to have the Holy Ghost amen we still have to have the Holy Ghost experience amen so we still gotta be washed at the blood of the Lamb we still gotta be sanctified from the things that we used to do we still gotta be filled with the Holy Ghost but that doesn't stop right there that is paving the way for Christ himself to live down on the inside of his bride amen we're not here to be by denominational or just trudging along according to the acts of men we're not here to be trudging along a and some natural action relying upon the the systems of man a member we're here to be led by the Holy Ghost amen every local body Amen under the leadership of their pastor amen amen is being as the pastor is being led by the Holy Ghost the members are being led by the Holy Ghost and they are one body we've been united together by one Holy Ghost amen and and when we were filled with the Holy Ghost this is that which was spoken of back in the beginning amen has now come to pass where God will Tabernacle with his people amen it's like we were back in the Garden of Eden it was before the fall we've been brought back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall do you now believe amen do you now believe this is what God is the plan of God for the last six thousand years has been to restore Eden back amen and what does he do he does it for his bride first before he does it for the whole world amen so so so as the world is rejoicing in their own nature we were sorrowful because we have a promise that has to be fulfilled amen but our sorrow is turned into joy when the Holy Ghost has come this is that which was spoken of this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears they it's no longer God living in a denomination it's no longer God living in a system Amen but God himself has chosen you to Tabernacle inside of you God has chosen you to be the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ to manifest himself not to the world but to manifests himself to you the everything that was written in John chapter 14 might come to pass the thing that was written in John chapter 15 might come to pass the everything that was written in John chapter 16 John chapter 17 would come to pass not interested in the church not in the system but it come to pass in your own heart that your sorrow might be turned into joy that you can live the life that Christ intended you before the fall amen so we're living in this world but we're not subject to the things of this world a man the world hasn't received its restoration yet but we're called to live in the restoration I will restore saith Lord all the years that the cankerworm the caterpillar has eaten right I will restore Jesus sent her in the brother grant and preach that message I will restore saith Lord all the years that these forc living for creatures have eaten right the palm warm the cankerworm the caterpillar they were eating off the leaves of the tree the bark of the tree and until the tree was destroyed but God says I will restore every year that was eaten our prophet priest she done to us right so when I because a prophet preached unto us just like Joshua back in the Old Testament we cling to that promise just as much as he cling to what Moses said we cling to our brother Branham said amen knowing that it will come to pass in our lives amen and we will enter into that promised land just the same as Joshua there are many out there that won't enter into the promised land but we received the message of the Prophet we will enter into that Promised Land a man so the promises of the scripture we will enjoy amen but the promise will is is that we get to experience the first fruits a full Redemption before the world itself does before the world receives its baptism of fire we receive our baptism of fire that's from a message own future home brother Ram said that we received it before the world received it just like the world went through its water baptism the sanctification by the blood amen and the fire baptism we get we get to escape the fire baptism of the earth because we've already received it now what do we do we have been given a promise that whatsoever you ask it shall be done unto you if you ask in my name right what is it we are now living above the world we've been given partnership joint heirs with Christ flesh of his flesh bone with his bone fill with His Holy Spirit you have as anointing upon us and now we are to live like we were back in the Garden of Eden before the fall because we are then we've been brought out of this own natural living and we got to think like we're living there Amen we got to bring this mind it's such a the subjection to understand that we're not living here we're living there seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we got to formulate this entire body to believe that do you now believe Jesus said do you now believe Amen and we have to it's a commandment we have to believe these things amen we have to experience these things why because if we will not believe it how can we experience amen now Joshua had to believe that Moses pulled the tabernacle out let's camp for a reason and set up the tabernacle outside the camp he did it for a purpose Joshua had to believe that and he and because when he saw the tabernacle leaving the camp he says I am going where that is going and he left the camp so we have to leave the camp of man leave the camp of thinking like men to think like the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we're here we have if you will not leave that camp you will not see him why do you think like men Jesus said amen we're not here - we're here or Paul said we're here - were here - to leave the camp we have to leave the camp you have to get that old thinking has to be has to die out amen and it takes sorrow to do that amen the old thinking to cast off the old man the old way of thinking to realize I am the bride of Lord Jesus Christ I am the one that God chose to live in the last days I am the one that God chose us to be in a rapture Amen I am the one that God chose to change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen and I am the one that God chose to begin the work before the rapture amen so that when the rapture comes a bride is already ready a man she's already been filled with the Holy Ghost she's already got the attributes she's already got the faith the virtue of the knowledge the temperance the patience the godliness a man she's already got the brotherly kindness she's got the capstone and is coming down a man brother man some things are going more from the negative to the positive they meant we're leaving the ages of the shadows we're going into the age of reality a man we get to experience it first amen why because this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears amen when brother Bram the next day after birth Baines he preached this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he started preaching Joshua saw the the scripture being fulfilled in his ears amen and he said Moses saw this day the Scriptures be fulfilled Noah got to live long enough to see this day this scripture was fulfilled hey man Daniel got to live long enough to see this day this scripture fulfilled amen the Anna and Sofia Anna and Simeon got to see this day this scripture was fulfilled amen and there are people they get to live in an age there are blessed people and they get to live in an age where the Scriptures are being fulfilled Amen you here we are this day this scripture has been fulfilled in our eyes do you now believe Amen will you now receive Amen there we're not just living in the age of a natural man system a man we're not living in an age of of denominations but we're living in an age where it's the only to Christ and his bride amen Christ and you Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen but when the Spirit of the Lord God falls upon my heart I will pray like Ganga pray when the Spirit of the Lord God falls upon my heart I will dance like David danced when the Spirit of the Lord God falls upon my heart I will love like Jesus loved amen why because it's the same spirit amen amen we are called to live on this earth not in a natural way we are called to be supernatural we go about the natural lives in this natural body but we are not natural people or natural we have to expect the supernatural because of what he has done amen amen amen brother Ram said there's not many new births nowadays because the seeds do not rot from the old systems they claim the new birth but they never died from the old ages systems now in the old aegis systems if you would read Romans Road or they would pray the sinner's prayer and you would with your with your mouth you would say I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and you go about living the rest of your days never actually expecting anything the the words of God to come off the pages of this Bible and man will spend years and decades of their lives saying because I prayed the sinner's prayer or I went down at the local Baptist Church or in Sunday school or whatever it was and that is just all there is to Christian life and because of that they are never endued with power from on high but yet that power is here and not to to live and in the old system but to die and rot that the new system right there where you become a living Tabernacle the Living God's dwelling place but if because they miss that they never become amen amen amen it's not many new births nowadays because the seeds do not rot from the old systems but they claim the new birth but they never died to the old age systems Amen that's when that was when they believed amen when they believed that they are no longer natural men amen we got a we have to come to the place where we accept do you now believe there you accept that you even if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost the acts of the Holy Ghost are down on the inside and it's to bring a revelation of who you are amen they you can do the greater works amen that Christ will act inside of you amen if you if you miss that and then why what are you doing here amen we see what the Holy Spirit did the first time he came and he hasn't changed he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen I want to preach read this from statue of perfect men it says the brother bran said then God was made flesh and dwelt among us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave His life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood to us through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our nature by sending up this and how is our nature changed by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God and then we become a dwelling place for God as Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the father the father and me I am in you and you are in me amen see know that God is in his church amen do you now believe are you in expectations amen everyone here is in a different stage of their walk but yet we've been called to believe amen amen this day this scripture has been fulfilled in your ears amen amen what manner of people are we to be amen amen let's just stand man your sorrow will be turned to joy Amen because the man child that was born in the earth amen amen brother Branham says I no longer call you Church I call you bride you are flesh of us less you are bone of his bone amen amen do you now believe amen you have to actually accept who you are my dad says when the church knows who she is amen that's when the rapture will go amen when she finally understands who is that she can do the greater works why because of who she is a man she's not here to live her own natural life but the Holy Spirit is here to live on the inside of you and to change you into the divine nature to no longer be like a natural man but to be a God man upon the earth like it was back in the Garden of Eden before the fall this is what is available not to the system but is available to you as a seed of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's just pray Heavenly Father we we thank you Lord for for we see the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world Lord that you have laid these things aside from generation to generation Lord to reveal them in these last days unto your bride Lord and here we stand father underneath this revelation Lord saying Lord now we believe or now we know now we receive that you are desiring to Tabernacle with men Lord that you are looking for a bride that has the characteristics of the divine nature Lord Lord and when we submit ourselves under that divine nature Lord made me they grow Lord may our ground be good ground Lord that we might be able to grow up Lord into the a hundredfold of the fruits of the gospel Lord Lord that whatever it is that you had in your mind when you were dying upon Calvary Lord that we would fulfill that prophecy Lord Lord and we just pray Lord therefore be for everybody here underneath the sound of my own voice Lord Lord that they would take what was spoken of by the prophet of our day Lord and that whatever that prophecy is like Joshua of old they would cling to it Lord they leave the camp Lord of men's systems or and to their own unto unto the system of the Holy Ghost Lord in order to be changed from the creature they once were or to be alive with the Living Tabernacle with the living God's dwelling place or that was your plan from before the foundation of the world Lord and here we are Lord this day this scripture is fulfilled in our eyes Lord and or we're looking for it Lord we know it we believe that we trust Lord and and and we're way Lord and tell be completely revealed as perfection Lord and are manifested in our in our in our life Lord and we just thank you Father for changing us Lord before you change the world Lord oh it's always an honor Lord to be to be chosen first Lord it's always an honor to be chosen to be the the firstfruits Lord and we thank you for it Lord that before you change the world Lord that you chose Lord to change us and we submit ourselves to that change by the baptism of fire of the Holy Ghost and we thank you Lord for all things there be anybody here Lord we pray that has not experienced this baptism of fire Lord I pray Lord that they would leave the camp Lord behind of the systems of their mind Lord and and died out and rot Lord to themselves Lord that they may live and new afresh and become the garden of Weeden before our God and we as thank you Lord we reclaim it Lord and we do now believe that this day the scripture is fulfilled in our years Lord and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you saints brother Isaac if you have come amen amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he has not changed amen what he has made available for us is you cannot rest until that which God has made available on to us you have actually experienced it
