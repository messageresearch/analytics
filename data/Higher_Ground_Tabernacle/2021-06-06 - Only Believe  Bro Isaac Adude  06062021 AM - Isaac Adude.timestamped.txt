[19:10] me have come over with word of
[19:16] [Music]
[19:23] prayer a real nice
[19:26] experience yesterday
[19:30] a brother from colia South Carolina that
[19:33] been here P many times probably dozens
[19:36] of
[19:38] times you probably don't know brother
[19:40] Den right but he and I had a high time
[19:46] yesterday fellowshipping together and uh
[19:49] he just pointed out something that I
[19:51] felt like I needed to share I could tell
[19:54] that enemy was really trying to resist
[19:57] us and
[19:59] and that's when a person gets the Holy
[20:02] Ghost sometimes they think they
[20:05] arrive but it's just the beginning and
[20:09] he pointed out there in Acts 10 how
[20:13] Peter
[20:14] resisted the spirit of God the voice and
[20:17] the vision of the spirit of God to go
[20:20] and to preach to
[20:22] cornelius's
[20:25] house now I don't think probably think
[20:29] we resisted the spirit of God but we
[20:32] have when we've not prayed thy will be
[20:35] done not my will and that's
[20:39] so such a strong
[20:41] Spirit against us and even as I sat out
[20:45] there this morning about the last half
[20:47] hour going back through it Lord just I
[20:51] was asking the Lord before I came in
[20:53] here open my eyes give me understanding
[20:56] give me Revelation
[20:59] just pouring out this I just encourage
[21:02] you I fig that wasn't just for me I just
[21:05] should start sharing
[21:08] [Music]
[21:10] that bow our heads and our
[21:13] hearts father God we come to you once

[21:48] Lord for providing your spirit to reside
[21:54] in our
[21:55] hearts for providing that seal until the
[21:59] day of

[22:04] up in you that you have
[22:09] provided understanding of your nature
[22:13] the
[22:14] attributes and we just want to be
[22:17] mindful of them every day and even now
[22:20] with the opportunity to be
[22:23] mindful of your faith the faith of Jesus

[22:41] thank you Lord for your work your
[22:43] special work the people your people Lord

[22:51] together have not forsaken assembly as
[22:55] some do and Lord the sacrifice
[22:59] we have made to come
[23:03] here we need to be we know that and such
[23:07] a special word not the words of a
[23:11] man dearly
[23:14] brother love our brother
[23:17] Rising we know he has waited on you Lord
[23:20] not depending upon own self but
[23:24] you so I pray that man get completely
[23:27] out of the way this
[23:29] morning and I pray father God that you
[23:33] provide your word Lord that through
[23:36] those jaws of clay come forth the words
[23:38] of God not just come forth but come
[23:42] forth in the power and the demonstration
[23:44] of Holy Ghost we thank you for the
[23:47] sacrifice we've made to give back to you

[48:10] 20 so the story it's
[48:13] uh a man had had a dump spirit and he
[48:17] was brought to the
[48:19] disciples and the disciples tried to
[48:22] pray for him but they couldn't because
[48:24] they didn't have enough faith enough Fai
[48:27] Spirit
[48:35] out amen verse 16 this is Jesus asking
[48:39] the scribes the Bible says that and he
[48:41] asked the scribes what question you with
[48:50] them and one of the multi and one of the
[48:54] multitude answered him say master
[48:57] I have brought unto thee my son which
[49:00] has a dumb
[49:09] spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he
[49:13] teth him and he forth and nashes with
[49:17] his Ste and pth away and I
[49:21] spake and I spake to that disciples that
[49:24] they should cast him out and they could
[49:26] not
[49:27] [Music]
[49:36] so now Jesus answered the Bible says
[49:38] that he answered him and saith oh
[49:41] faithless
[49:43] regeneration how long shall I be with
[49:45] you and how long shall I suffer you
[49:49] bring him to me unto me
[49:59] you know Jesus here is saying faithless
[50:04] generation how long shall I be with
[50:08] you you know because if you read the
[50:10] chapter before before it
[50:13] you you understand that the disciples
[50:16] went out to pray for the sick
[50:20] people you know and they prayed for
[50:22] others and others were
[50:25] healed you but when it came to this you
[50:28] know particular
[50:31] demon they just didn't have enough
[50:34] Faith so in other words that Jesus was
[50:37] trying to bring them into a stage of
[50:43] adoption you know but you know they
[50:45] didn't in other words they didn't have
[50:47] the secret or how to
[50:51] operate you know the Bible say verse
[50:54] 20 and and and the B and they brought
[50:57] him unto him and when he saw him shred
[51:01] away the spirit here him and he fell on
[51:04] the ground and wed for
[51:12] me and he asked his father how long is
[51:16] it ago since this came unto him and he
[51:20] said of a child
[51:29] and often times he has cast him into
[51:31] fire Into the Fire and into the waters
[51:35] to destroy him but if thou can do
[51:39] anything have compassion on us and help
[51:47] [Music]
[51:50] us Jesus said unto him if thou can
[51:53] believe all things are possible to him
[51:57] that
[52:00] [Music]
[52:01] believeth and St away the father of the
[52:04] charot cried out and said with tears
[52:07] Lord I believe help thou my
[52:15] unbelief when Jesus saw that the people
[52:18] came running together he rebuked the fou
[52:21] Spirit saying unto him thou dumb Spirit
[52:25] thou dumb and death Spirit death spirit
[52:28] I charge thee come out of him and enter
[52:32] no more into him
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] Jes and the spirit cried and ran him
[52:45] sore and came out of him and he was as
[52:50] one dead in so much that many said he is
[52:54] dead
[53:03] but but Jesus still came by the hand and
[53:05] lifted him up and he
[53:07] arose and when he was come into the
[53:10] house his disciple asked him privately
[53:14] why could not we cast him out
[53:27] here as Jesus answered he said unto them
[53:31] this kind can come forth by nothing but
[53:35] by prayer and
[53:41] fasting amen let's bow ahead and
[53:46] pray dear heavenly father

[56:16] seated this morning my subject will be
[56:20] only
[56:24] believe that's all it takes only
[56:28] believe you know as uh as we read here
[56:32] in Mark chapter 9 verse 16 to
[56:38] 29 you will notice that the disciple
[56:41] came to a
[56:45] stopping where they stop you know they
[56:48] couldn't go they couldn't go you know
[56:51] farther because they had an you know
[56:53] they had something in front of them that
[56:55] they couldn't overcome
[56:58] you know this man you know came with his
[57:02] child you know who had a dump Spirit on
[57:06] him and the disciple you know couldn't
[57:10] cast that Spirit
[57:12] out you know
[57:14] because as you know as Jesus said that
[57:16] that Spirit you know those type of
[57:18] demons you know only go they go away you
[57:21] know with by prayer and fasting
[57:27] you know the disciple now when they
[57:29] prayed for the first
[57:32] time you know they saw that they noticed
[57:34] that the demon
[57:38] resisted you know they started to lose
[57:41] Faith you know they began to ask
[57:43] themselves a questions you
[57:46] know you know do we really have the
[57:48] power to cast this demon
[57:52] out you know can we really cast this
[57:55] demon out
[57:58] you know they had everything that Jesus
[58:00] because Jesus was teaching them the
[58:01] power of
[58:04] Faith you know they first went out and
[58:06] they saw the
[58:09] result you know they pray for the Blind
[58:11] and the blind
[58:13] saw you know they pray for people who
[58:16] couldn't speak and they were able to to
[58:18] say
[58:20] something you know they prayed for the
[58:22] sick and the sick was healed they were
[58:24] healed
[58:26] but here he comes this
[58:28] demon you know the disciple just didn't
[58:31] have
[58:33] faith that he required to cast that
[58:36] demon
[58:38] out and when Jesus
[58:40] came you know he just
[58:43] spoke you know he said you demon get out
[58:45] of him and leave him
[58:47] alone and don't don't you ever come back
[58:51] you know and then then that demon went
[58:53] that demon went away
[58:56] you know Exodus 14 verse 13-
[59:03] 15 you know here the Bible is saying
[59:06] that you
[59:08] know that and Moses said unto the
[59:13] people fear ye not stand
[59:17] still and see the salvation of the
[59:22] Lord which he which he will show you
[59:25] today
[59:30] for for the see the salvation of the
[59:33] Lord which he will show you
[59:37] today for the the Egyptians whom he have
[59:40] seen
[59:43] today you shall see them again no more
[59:46] forever the Lord shall fight for
[59:49] you and you shall hold your
[59:52] peace and the Lord said unto Moses
[59:56] wherefore criest thou unto
[59:58] me speak unto the children of
[1:00:02] Israel that they go
[1:00:04] forward you know Moses received the word
[1:00:06] from the
[1:00:08] Lord you know he had to he had to speak
[1:00:11] to the children of
[1:00:12] Israel you know to create in them of the
[1:00:17] faith you know to be able to
[1:00:20] walk you know to be able to go
[1:00:23] forward because the children of Israel
[1:00:26] Al They sto they had you know they were
[1:00:28] they wasn't able to to go forward to go
[1:00:30] uh to go
[1:00:33] forward because they had an obstacle
[1:00:36] before them that they couldn't
[1:00:38] overcome you know when they looked
[1:00:40] behind them they so Pharaoh was
[1:00:43] coming and in front of them they saw the
[1:00:45] Red
[1:00:46] Sea you know many of them started to cry
[1:00:50] and and they ran into they ran to
[1:00:54] Moses they said but Moses look at
[1:00:56] Pharaoh here's Pharaoh
[1:00:58] coming you know what are we going to do
[1:01:01] you know he's so determined to kill all
[1:01:03] of
[1:01:04] us you know Moses went to the
[1:01:07] Lord you know Moses started to cry to
[1:01:10] the
[1:01:11] Lord you know and the lord gave him this
[1:01:14] word of
[1:01:16] comfort you know to tell the people not
[1:01:18] to
[1:01:20] fear you know to hold their
[1:01:23] peace you know and and then they will
[1:01:25] see see the salvation of Lord you know
[1:01:28] in other words Moses God told Moses to
[1:01:30] tell the people to only
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:35] believe and they will see the salvation
[1:01:37] of the Lord so now here's the verse
[1:01:40] 15 now God turns to
[1:01:43] Moses you know he says but Moses why are
[1:01:46] you crying to
[1:01:49] me you know you have the power to speak
[1:01:52] the
[1:01:53] word and the thing will happen
[1:01:56] you know God said that wherefore
[1:01:58] wherefore criest thou unto
[1:02:01] me you know speak unto the children of
[1:02:04] Israel that go
[1:02:06] forward you know God said Moses I gave
[1:02:08] you the
[1:02:11] authority to speak the
[1:02:13] word you know I gave you the
[1:02:16] authority you know to speak the word and
[1:02:18] to bring things into
[1:02:22] existence you know to to speak the word
[1:02:24] and whatever you say well
[1:02:27] happen you know look at what I have done
[1:02:29] with you in Egypt
[1:02:31] Egypt you know I think through you spoke
[1:02:35] the word and and I believe I think it
[1:02:38] was 49 uh uh Miracles and 10 plagues
[1:02:41] came to came to
[1:02:45] Egypt
[1:02:48] miracles you know when Moses was
[1:02:50] speaking no in other words God was
[1:02:52] telling me look at everything that you

[1:02:58] said you know but you still don't have
[1:03:00] that Faith to speak the
[1:03:03] word you know therefore speak the word

[1:08:39] David also came to that
[1:08:42] point you know David also came to that
[1:08:46] stage you know where he looked at on his
[1:08:49] right and looked in his
[1:08:51] left you know he just couldn't find any
[1:08:54] help you know he looked in the heels he
[1:08:57] just couldn't find any
[1:08:59] help and then he was inspired to write
[1:09:01] these
[1:09:03] Psalms of
[1:09:06] 121 you know the Bible says that Psalms
[1:09:10] 121
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] verse1 I will lift up my eyes unto the
[1:09:19] heels from whence cometh my
[1:09:22] help my Help Cometh From The Lord
[1:09:27] which made Heaven and
[1:09:29] Earth he will not suffer thaty food to
[1:09:32] be
[1:09:34] moved because he that keepeth thee will
[1:09:37] not slumber nor will it
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:42] sleep behold he that keepeth Israel
[1:09:45] shall neither slumber nor

[1:10:41] Psalms you know uh King the way King
[1:10:44] James you know translated this you know
[1:10:49] verse James you know it's quite
[1:10:51] different than you know other
[1:10:52] translations
[1:10:55] other translations I mean to me it's
[1:10:57] more
[1:11:01] clear because they they they wrote it as
[1:11:03] a
[1:11:05] question you know in other words verse
[1:11:08] one you know David is is saying that
[1:11:11] shall I lift up my my my KN to the
[1:11:16] [Music]

[1:11:32] question you know should I try you know
[1:11:34] should I lift my hand my you know my my

[1:11:50] enemies you know maybe it was surrounded
[1:11:53] by Philistines and all all those things
[1:11:55] all those you
[1:11:58] know you know but he just couldn't find
[1:12:01] a way to
[1:12:03] go you know he just he couldn't find a
[1:12:05] way you know a place to
[1:12:08] run you know he was like this you know

[1:14:32] tribulations and and you know God bring
[1:14:35] those situations to
[1:14:38] us you know to help us have experience
[1:14:41] have have a daily life experience with
[1:14:47] him you know because we we we understand
[1:14:50] that there is so many people who leave
[1:14:52] off you know their past experience like
[1:14:54] for from from 40 years or I don't know
[1:14:56] how how long it
[1:15:00] was you know but you need to have that
[1:15:03] daily life experience with
[1:15:06] God you know I'm going to tell you a
[1:15:09] story you know it happened
[1:15:13] 1800 you know there was a man who was
[1:15:16] you know uh uh he had the hand he was on
[1:15:18] the the hand
[1:15:20] car hand car I don't know in French what
[1:15:23] what's that version those car you know
[1:15:26] back in back in the days where you had
[1:15:28] to pump it before it goes you had to go
[1:15:31] through U it was on the the Tren truck
[1:15:34] it was going on the on the Tren
[1:15:38] truck yeah so you had to pump it and
[1:15:40] then and and then the I mean the hand
[1:15:42] car will
[1:15:44] go so the more you pump it you know the
[1:15:47] the the faster you
[1:15:50] go so this man was on that hand
[1:15:53] car you know he was pumping the car and
[1:15:56] then and then he was he was
[1:15:59] going you know just when you reach his
[1:16:01] highest
[1:16:04] speed this man was
[1:16:07] shot and he was dead he was killed he
[1:16:10] was dead so as when he was when he was
[1:16:14] when he was still
[1:16:15] alive this man has built a great
[1:16:21] momentum you know that helped him you
[1:16:24] know that that kept the the the car
[1:16:27] going
[1:16:30] costing you
[1:16:33] know you know though the man was
[1:16:36] killed but the car was still
[1:16:40] going you know it went the car went to
[1:16:43] the I mean until it reached the next
[1:16:45] County the next
[1:16:48] County then he
[1:16:50] stopped you know people who saw this man
[1:16:53] on the car from afar
[1:16:56] you know maybe some of them you know
[1:16:58] could say wellow this man is going so
[1:17:02] fast and look at him he's
[1:17:05] resting you know he's even sleeping
[1:17:07] feeling the air and all the goodness of
[1:17:09] of the hand
[1:17:11] car but they couldn't understand that
[1:17:14] this man was no longer
[1:17:17] living but because that man has built a
[1:17:21] great momentum
[1:17:25] the car was able to go to Coast until
[1:17:28] the until reach until reach the next
[1:17:33] County you know this is the same thing
[1:17:35] with us
[1:17:36] Christians you know sometimes we have
[1:17:39] real real experience with
[1:17:42] God you know it's an experience that you
[1:17:44] know that certainly this experience is
[1:17:47] real you know God has said our word on
[1:17:52] fire he said our word on fire
[1:17:56] you know and and then this experience is
[1:17:58] so real that that you know everything in
[1:18:01] the Bible marching that you know telling
[1:18:02] you that this experience is only
[1:18:08] God you know but but but you just let
[1:18:11] but for some reason you just let the
[1:18:12] devil to come to you and then take that
[1:18:15] you know take that consecrated life off
[1:18:18] you know out from from you
[1:18:25] you know because that experience was so
[1:18:27] real to
[1:18:29] you and people outside you know they
[1:18:31] noticed that that experience was
[1:18:35] real you know people when the devil has
[1:18:38] already come and and he took that prayer
[1:18:40] life away from
[1:18:43] you you know he took that joy of the
[1:18:46] Lord away from
[1:18:48] you you know he he took that consecrated
[1:18:51] life away from
[1:18:53] you but people you know as you have
[1:18:56] built a great momentum as that
[1:18:58] experience has built a great
[1:19:01] momentum you know it's helping you I
[1:19:03] mean it's costing it's still
[1:19:06] costing you know in other words the
[1:19:08] people from the
[1:19:10] outside you know they're still thinking
[1:19:12] that this man is so on fire from
[1:19:15] God you know this man is still closer to
[1:19:19] God as he
[1:19:21] was you know this man you know has he's
[1:19:24] still loving God as it
[1:19:26] was but you inside of you you know
[1:19:29] exactly that the devil has taken that
[1:19:31] Joy away from
[1:19:34] you you know you're just leaving off
[1:19:37] that that you know that old
[1:19:40] experience you know there is nothing new
[1:19:43] you know happening in your
[1:19:45] life you know it's just that influence
[1:19:47] that people saw you when you had that
[1:19:51] experience you know you're just leaving
[1:19:53] all that that they from that
[1:19:58] experience but in knew you're so certain
[1:20:00] that you don't have that life
[1:20:03] anymore you know that's a wrong place to
[1:20:07] be you know we have to have a daily walk
[1:20:10] with
[1:20:11] God you know that experience can ca can
[1:20:14] help you cating that experience you know
[1:20:16] that can help you
[1:20:19] cating and if you don't wake
[1:20:22] up you know you will find yourself Dead
[1:20:24] for
[1:20:25] forever you know if you don't wake
[1:20:28] up and say Lord Lord help me
[1:20:32] Jesus you know as this man he said that
[1:20:34] God I believe but help my
[1:20:38] unbelief you know you will find yourself
[1:20:41] that even that little voice that you
[1:20:42] still have all dead and
[1:20:48] quiet and there is no
[1:20:50] hope you know and this stage is the
[1:20:52] stage where every Christian you know go
[1:20:57] through you know we all sometimes you
[1:20:59] know some in some point of our life we
[1:21:01] went through that
[1:21:04] experience you know where we were so on
[1:21:06] fire with
[1:21:08] God you know God doing great
[1:21:12] things but somewhere you started eating
[1:21:14] for you eating from the wrong
[1:21:18] table you know sometimes you started you
[1:21:21] know listening to the wrong type of
[1:21:22] music
[1:21:25] you know you start hanging hanging with
[1:21:27] you know wrong wrong wrong
[1:21:30] friends you know you start eating wrong
[1:21:34] food you know you let your eyes seeing
[1:21:37] the things that you're not supposed to
[1:21:40] see you know you let your ears you know
[1:21:43] hearing things that you're not supposed
[1:21:45] to
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:48] hear you know slowly you're going away
[1:21:50] from
[1:21:52] God you know slowly the devil is coming
[1:21:55] and he's killing you you know step by
[1:21:59] step but because when you were in fire
[1:22:03] on in fire for God on fire for
[1:22:07] God you know you have built a great
[1:22:12] reputation you know people who sees you
[1:22:16] see you you know they think that this is
[1:22:18] the same brother
[1:22:20] Isaac you know he's so on fire for God
[1:22:24] you know look at what he has done look
[1:22:26] at what God has done through

[1:22:30] what you know go how God has helped him
[1:22:32] and how God has you know had made him
[1:22:37] successful but in you you're so certain
[1:22:39] that that same God is no longer as it
[1:22:41] was inside of
[1:22:45] you because you let something wrong
[1:22:48] happen in your
[1:22:50] life you know but you don't have to let
[1:22:52] it be the you know the same way
[1:22:57] you know you can still stand up and wake
[1:23:01] up and go to the
[1:23:04] rock you know don't get used to

[1:30:22] go to the pool
[1:30:24] you know somebody was going there
[1:30:27] before you know every time you know

[1:30:35] hope because the angel was coming and
[1:30:38] then stir that
[1:30:40] water and the first one and the first
[1:30:43] person to to go

[1:31:47] satisfaction that I'm looking
[1:31:50] for you know it wasn't that time
[1:31:54] that Jesus walked in you know it wasn't
[1:31:56] that time that Jesus came to him you

[1:32:07] heard his
[1:32:08] cry you know God heard his
[1:32:11] prayer but God was waiting for the right
[1:32:14] moment you know only

[1:32:39] know it takes you 12
[1:32:43] hours you know the the sun will still

[1:33:15] going to do
[1:33:17] it you know he tell you I don't know
[1:33:20] how you know why is he going to do it

[1:33:40] son that's not a question that I can't
[1:33:43] answer you know God said it I believe it
[1:33:47] that sett it Gideon how are you going to
[1:33:50] fight but you know how are you going to

[1:34:02] understand it you know even myself I try
[1:34:05] to look for an answer for the valuable
[1:34:07] explanation I just can't find
[1:34:10] it but God said it I believe it and that
[1:34:15] settles it Moses how are you going to go
[1:34:18] and and set the children and and set the
[1:34:20] children of Israel free

[1:34:26] army you know that is the greatest army
[1:34:29] in the
[1:34:31] earth Moses said I don't
[1:34:33] know he just told me to take my my my my
[1:34:36] my to take my my my my uh my rod and
[1:34:41] go you know Moses can you even you can
[1:34:44] even go buy a

[1:37:46] person amen the prophet says that you
[1:37:50] know sometimes we're just so afraid of
[1:37:52] our Goliath
[1:37:55] amen when that Goliath come to
[1:37:58] you you see the size of the
[1:38:01] Goliath you know you ask yourself a

[1:38:21] there he
[1:38:22] was standing there boasting himself and
[1:38:27] bragging it seems like the odds is
[1:38:37] down and then he said that don't have no
[1:38:40] let don't have no blood
[1:38:44] shed he said let some man let some men
[1:38:48] can come come come and fight
[1:38:51] me and then if it win if I
[1:38:55] win then you all just serve
[1:38:59] me and then if you

[1:39:09] you see when the devil thinks he's got
[1:39:13] the odds on
[1:39:16] you that's when he likes to make his br
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:24] but he met a wrong
[1:39:26] man he met the Litt man in the country
[1:39:31] in the
[1:39:33] country
[1:39:34] little sto
[1:39:39] shored R looking
[1:39:42] fellow you know he
[1:39:44] said do you mean to tell me that
[1:39:49] you the army of the Living
[1:39:52] God will stand there and let this
[1:39:54] uncircumcised Philistine defy the army
[1:39:57] of the Living
[1:40:03] God why he was shocked at
[1:40:06] it you know he just in other words he
[1:40:08] couldn't believe what you know his
[1:40:10] friends or his brother were
[1:40:15] doing the prophet said
[1:40:17] why why because he was a
[1:40:21] Believer the others were make
[1:40:25] Believers see he was a genuine
[1:40:29] believer he said if you
[1:40:32] afraid I will go fight
[1:40:34] him see what a challenge for a little
[1:40:37] guy like
[1:40:39] that and so he was a
[1:40:42] Believer and he done exact and he done
[1:40:45] just exactly what he knew that God would
[1:40:50] do amen and the size of Goliath didn't
[1:40:53] Shake
[1:40:55] David you know David was asking his for
[1:40:58] his brothers but why are you letting
[1:41:00] this man defile the army of
[1:41:06] God you know why but you know this
[1:41:12] Goliath his flesh will be will be will
[1:41:15] be the bird's
[1:41:18] food because I have faith in
[1:41:20] God the same God that gave me that
[1:41:24] experience the same God that gives me
[1:41:26] the daily experience that I
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:30] have the same God who will kill this
[1:41:34] beast and they will serve
[1:41:37] us faith is by hearing the
[1:41:42] word the word of the promise The Word of
[1:41:45] Promise if you don't have a
[1:41:48] promise then you venture you venture out
[1:41:51] upon your own faith
[1:41:54] but if you can't take the promise if you
[1:41:57] if you can't take a promise of
[1:42:00] God that's God's promise to
[1:42:03] you the woman the woman that touched His
[1:42:07] Garment had no promise of
[1:42:09] that by her faith without a
[1:42:13] promise God her her
[1:42:16] healing now if she could get her healing
[1:42:19] by by her faith
[1:42:23] without a promise in what she was
[1:42:28] doing amen how much more are we to get
[1:42:32] our our
[1:42:36] healing by faith in a promise that God
[1:42:40] is manifesting and Vindicated before
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] us and he has brought he has brought it
[1:42:49] to us by by his
[1:42:51] word come come around and confirm his
[1:42:56] word you know if that
[1:42:58] woman she didn't have faith she didn't
[1:43:01] have any
[1:43:02] promise you know in other words nobody
[1:43:05] had this problem that he
[1:43:09] had he was actually the first
[1:43:12] one he had no
[1:43:14] promise to hold her faith to base her
[1:43:17] faith
[1:43:18] on but that couldn't stop
[1:43:21] her because the prophet said that faith
[1:43:23] has no
[1:43:25] barrier you know faith will go through
[1:43:27] any challenge that will come to
[1:43:31] it you know this woman didn't looked at
[1:43:33] her situation saying that I have no
[1:43:35] promise so I can't have
[1:43:39] faith but she still
[1:43:41] believed that even though I don't have
[1:43:44] any promise for this
[1:43:48] circumstance I can I can as well be the
[1:43:50] first one to be healed you know for
[1:43:52] others com com after
[1:43:56] me she had faith in God you know because
[1:44:00] worrying doesn't help
[1:44:04] you you know worrying doesn't change any
[1:44:08] situation you know but Faith does try to
[1:44:12] imagine yourself you in
[1:44:14] prison and they say that you you'll be
[1:44:16] you'll be killed
[1:44:18] tomorrow you know even though you try to
[1:44:21] worry you know you know from that time
[1:44:24] that the news came to you until the day
[1:44:27] that you will
[1:44:30] die nothing will change I mean you can
[1:44:33] worry as you can and cry and do whatever
[1:44:36] you
[1:44:38] can stop eating and not talking to
[1:44:42] anybody you nothing will change the
[1:44:45] situation won't
[1:44:46] change but it just doesn't kill you to
[1:44:49] have faith in
[1:44:51] God you know at least the faith in
[1:44:55] God will change the
[1:44:57] situation you know you will be you'll be
[1:44:59] granted the
[1:45:02] grace you know if you have faith in God
[1:45:05] you know there are people who have been
[1:45:07] you know the angel walked in the prison
[1:45:08] and then they walk
[1:45:12] free you need an example there is Peter
[1:45:14] in the
[1:45:15] Bible you know there is Paul you know
[1:45:19] just have faith in
[1:45:20] God you know only believe
[1:45:24] you know just let off the
[1:45:26] pressure and let God
[1:45:29] act just let off the
[1:45:31] pressure and Let
[1:45:34] Jesus you know have act you know in
[1:45:37] closing let's read I'll close with this
[1:45:39] thought um Romans chapter 8
[1:45:43] verse uh Hebrews I'm sorry Hebrews
[1:45:46] chapter 11 verse
[1:45:53] I'll start from verse eight and then I
[1:45:55] will jump out the verses
[1:45:59] until to famili
[1:46:03] verse the Bible say verse eight of
[1:46:06] Hebrews chapter

[1:46:28] Abraham went when he was called to go
[1:46:30] out into a place which he should have to
[1:46:33] receive
[1:46:34] inheritance
[1:46:42] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[1:46:46] whether whether he
[1:46:48] went by faith he
[1:46:51] surgeon in the land of
[1:46:53] promise as as a Str uh uh as in a
[1:46:56] strange country dwelling in dwelling in
[1:46:59] Tabernacles with Isaac and
[1:47:01] Jacob they hars with him of the same
[1:47:12] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:47:15] has no Foundation whose Builder and
[1:47:18] maker is God
[1:47:27] because through faith also
[1:47:30] Sarah also Sarah herself received
[1:47:33] strength and convin and conceived uh and
[1:47:37] conceived seed and was delivered of a
[1:47:40] child when she was when she was past age
[1:47:43] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:47:46] promised
[1:47:56] you know I love how the bible say that
[1:47:57] she judged him faithful who had
[1:48:03] promised and that faith in God was
[1:48:06] able you know to strengthen
[1:48:09] him to conceive
[1:48:13] seed amen that faith in God you know
[1:48:16] that Abraham had he was able to see a
[1:48:20] vision of a city
[1:48:24] whose Builder was
[1:48:27] Christ and then he put his Fai he set
[1:48:29] his
[1:48:30] faith you know looking for for that City
[1:48:34] you know going to that City you know
[1:48:36] verse 13 the bible say that these all
[1:48:40] died in
[1:48:42] faith not having received the
[1:48:46] promises but having seen them a far off
[1:48:53] but and were persuaded of
[1:48:56] them and embrace them and confess that
[1:49:00] there were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:49:05] earth for for for they that say such
[1:49:08] things declare plainly that they seek a
[1:49:12] country a
[1:49:15] country and truly if they had been
[1:49:18] mindful of their
[1:49:20] country from from once they came out
[1:49:27] they might they might have had
[1:49:28] opportunity to have
[1:49:31] returned but now they they desire a
[1:49:34] better
[1:49:36] country that is in Heavenly that is in
[1:49:42] Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to
[1:49:45] be called a
[1:49:48] God for he has prepared for for them a
[1:49:51] city
[1:49:53] you know those they died in
[1:49:56] faith you know hoping to see that to go
[1:49:59] to get that to get to that
[1:50:02] country but they had not received that
[1:50:05] promise I mean they had the promise but
[1:50:07] you know uh the Bible say but they have
[1:50:10] having
[1:50:11] received but not having received their
[1:50:17] promises you know verse 13 these all
[1:50:20] died in faith not having Reed received
[1:50:23] the Promises by having seen that having
[1:50:26] seen them from a far off um
[1:50:32] um you know in other words they saw a
[1:50:35] vision of that
[1:50:37] City you know they wanted to get to that
[1:50:39] City so
[1:50:41] bad but you know they just couldn't they
[1:50:43] just couldn't I mean they didn't got
[1:50:45] they didn't have that you know God
[1:50:47] didn't give them the grace to to get to
[1:50:48] that
[1:50:51] City but they died still
[1:50:54] believing amen verse
[1:50:57] 23 by faith
[1:51:00] Moses when he was
[1:51:02] born was he was he three months uh uh
[1:51:06] was he three months of his parents
[1:51:09] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:51:11] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:51:13] commandment
[1:51:22] by faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:51:26] refused to be called the son of the the
[1:51:28] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:51:30] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[1:51:32] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:51:35] pleasures of sin for a
[1:51:46] season amen the Bible said that choosing
[1:51:49] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[1:51:51] people of God than to enjoy the
[1:51:53] pleasures of sin for a
[1:52:00] season you know because Moses in mind he
[1:52:02] had that seity in
[1:52:05] mind and to get to that
[1:52:08] City you know this temporary pleasures
[1:52:11] of
[1:52:14] sin you know was not going to help
[1:52:17] him you know he had to choose God's side
[1:52:22] he had to stand on God's
[1:52:24] promise you know for him to for him you
[1:52:27] know to get to that
[1:52:29] City you know verse
[1:52:32] 32 and and what shall I move and what
[1:52:35] shall I more

[1:53:37] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:53:39] better
[1:53:41] Resurrection you know in other words
[1:53:42] because the
[1:53:44] Deliverance was to deny
[1:53:48] God then you will no longer be tortured
[1:53:52] but they had a promise of that
[1:53:54] City you know to have a better

[1:54:43] scourings yet moreover of bonds of
[1:54:48] imprisonment they were
[1:54:51] stoned they were son a

[1:55:11] and goat
[1:55:15] skins being
[1:55:17] destitute Afflicted and
[1:55:20] tormented of whom whom the word was not
[1:55:25] worthy that wandered in desert and in
[1:55:30] mountains and in dens and the caves of
[1:55:33] the
[1:55:34] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:55:37] good report through
[1:55:46] faith received not a
[1:55:50] promise but God having provided some
[1:55:53] better thing for
[1:55:56] us that they without
[1:55:59] us will not be made
[1:56:03] perfect you know what was that
[1:56:05] promise was
[1:56:07] Perfection you know what was that
[1:56:10] promise you know was to go in that you
[1:56:12] know to go to that
[1:56:14] City that Christ was the
[1:56:17] builder you know they had to go through
[1:56:19] those
[1:56:21] trials you know they had to stand there
[1:56:23] you know still believing in
[1:56:26] God you know some of them were hiden by
[1:56:30] lions you know some of them were CAU in
[1:56:34] half but yet they still
[1:56:37] believe you know but here it says that
[1:56:40] but even though you know they did all of
[1:56:44] that you know they will not be made made
[1:56:50] perfect without us
[1:56:52] but how are we going to be about how are
[1:56:54] we going to be be made
[1:56:58] perfect you know if we have the same
[1:57:00] Faith as they

[1:57:50] faith and God was able to close those
[1:57:52] lion's
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] mouth you know because they knew
[1:57:58] something that Resurrection was
[1:58:00] coming you know it was through that same
[1:58:04] faith that Joseph you know saw the
[1:58:07] city you know he he saw the place of
[1:58:12] resurrection and he told his
