that's young men amen praise praise the Lord amen let's look here in in um First Kings 17 and 1 and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hence and turn thee Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there I want you to all say there so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook cherith and which that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zerath which belongeth to ziden and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain Thee I want to minister tonight on a on a real simple subject a place called there let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for your love we thank you for your grace we thank you for a church right here in De Mo Iowa that is proclaiming the message of the hour how we love our brother Isaiah and his wife and I pray Lord that you would strengthen their hands strengthen all the officers of the church strengthen all of the congregation I pray Lord that you would help me tonight as I Minister your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen good to Good to Be Alive good to be a Christian tonight amen amen I want to preach on a place called there amen the great architect has a master plan for each of our lives each one of you have a pre-ordained destiny now this Destiny is not just spiritually but it is physically for the Apostle Paul says that he prayed that we would be preserved blameless Body Soul and Spirit we serve a God that that is concerned about every part of our Lives brother Brandon would say the church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor PRS was bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you in his own body you say now preacher now I understand that spiritually but I'm in charge of my own natural Destiny but I want to say God is concerned Body Soul and Spirit amen amen he would go on to say he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife a farmer a preacher a prophet Prophet this or that he placed you positionally well someone and shout hallelujah God's concerned about every part of your life he would also say we often get a view of him that would make him very impersonal as as though God created all of the earth and set up its laws that pertain to it and then stands back an impersonal God it is as though he made and created mankind but then he lost interest in mankind brother Brandon would say but that is the wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and sustainer God is interested in every one of you young men God's interested in you young ladies God is interested in you m God is interested in Pastor in his wife God is interested in humanity God loves his people amen can you say Amen now God knows in from beginning he is the beginner and the finisher of our faith he starts us and he'll finish us he that has begun a good work will be faithful

who I am going to marry am I going to be rich and is this guy that I marry I sure hope he's goodl looking am I going to be famous God knows but he ain't saying all we hear is go to a place [Applause]

Hallelujah to too many times we want to know it all what what's going to happen what's going to be the next day and the next day and the next day God says just go to that place called there you take care of the there and then I'll lead you to the next [Music] there oh can you say amen hallelujah amen you you see even God's prophets don't even know amen they don't have the skinny on everything God they have to rely on God and walk by faith and faith alone can you say amen amen now now now does God know is God going to lead you has God been faithful is he going to take you to your destiny you got to trust him can you say Amen if I did know everything about my uh from the beginning to the end my heart would be overwhelmed brother Brooks if you would have known when you first came even it just just coming into this message all of the events that would have taken place to where you are right now your heart might be overwhelmed but God doesn't tell you everything God tells you you've got to trust in me I know what tomorrow H I know what you're going to go through I know where you're going to be I am going to be faithful Hallelujah that'll make you want a sh hallelujah oh yes yes amen

34 years ago that that good looking hunk that she married was going to be fat and bald fat and Bal amen and that I would I broke my back in five places and that I would have five Church splits if God would have told me all of that at the beginning I would have been depressed and and say Lord you're going to have to pick somebody else I would have been sit there saying let me die right now just get me out of my misery before I even get started but my life was going to be full of places called there there was going to be mountains and there was going to be valleys there's going to be the power of the Holy Ghost there's also going to be times of discouragement God says I will meet you there I'll never leave you nor for can you say amen amen I wonder if you could give me a little more monitors is that okay can y'all do that praise the Lord oh yes now here comes Elijah he was simply told go there oh thank you brother amen amen oh my now he was not told about the Widow he was not told about the fire coming down from heaven he was not told about the 400 prophets that he was going to slay he was not told that Elijah was going to try to kill him he was not told that he was going to be in a cave begging God to take his life all he was told is I want you to go to the brook cheriff for I have commanded the Ravens to feed you there I would rather be in the middle of God's will there I would rather be where God wants me there rather be there than to be I would rather be there than to be with my name on the billboard because there is where the blessings of God are there is where the anointing is there is where God says I will be with you can you say Amen let me stay where God has placed me at for there he has commanded the supernatural I'm going to have the Ravens to bring you McDonald's every morning say amen I have commanded the brook to state but then one day I don't guess they had watches so he was looking at the sun my stomach's growling my Ravens where they go I ain't got no more food the water Brook God must forsaken me the there there's no water there's no McDonald's McDonald I'm sitting here Lord I was your Prophet God you've called God hey jeh and God Appears and says I want you to goath because I've got a widow woman there there there I've got a widow woman there that will sustain you there Hallelujah God don't have to do it your way God don't have to do it my way don't have to do it the way you think he should do [Music] it the master plan and we simply trust in him well shout hallelujah let the devil hear you say hallelujah hallelujah yes sir amen so the prophets have to walk by faith too amen life's journey is full of [Music] theirs and we just trust the master and we walk with the master we walk hand in hand with a master he knows tomorrow I don't I don't know where I'm going he does I don't know what's in store for me he does me walk with the master hallelujah what can you say amen amen I don't know what I'm going where where I'm going Lord but not my will but thine be done comes from trust trust comes from a faith in that one who has proven himself real he that has begun the good work has been faithful to confirm it to my heart I don't understand the trials I'm going through I don't understand the heartache that's coming my way I don't know why God is not fighting my battle he's fighting your battles he's right there with you he knows your tear your pray knows your [Music] cry can you say Amen turn to your neighbor and tell them quit sweating the details let's and just walk with the Lord hallelujah amen now if this is a little too loud if if if we're getting too much ring is that okay all right amen now Brothers you're going to have to fight to win I don't believe it was absolutely easy for for for Elijah to stay there at that Brook cheriff waiting on those buzzards to bring food to but it took some faith and he was willing to trust God there are Supernatural forces that want to take every one of you down and you think that us pastors are are are immune from those kind of forces those forces are against the men of God more than you would ever think matter of fact I say those forces are against the men of God more than any other in the church man you know why because you're needed as a leader you're needed as a leader come on the ministry is there for the church and the devil is fighting he fights hard he's determined to keep you from your destiny train on you young men women but there's a group on the beyond the curtain of time who has already arrived to the Final Destination and the prophet of God was transported up there beyond the curtain of time and there were Millions over there and they were all saying we're waiting on you brother Bram came back and he said I seen you over there did he see

I will meet you boys now we're praying and we're asking God we don't want to go there but God you'll never see me anywhere else I will I wish y'all would help me preach for a moment here T when the devil is trying to get you out of that fiery furnace hands and you [Music] rejoice knowing that God is right there Hallelujah why are you rejoicing you shouldn't be rejoicing why why are you happy you should be sad you're in the worst trial I've ever seen anybody go through walking with my Lord walk Hallelujah I'm walking with my Lord I may be in the trial I may be in the valley I may [Music] but I am with him there I know I told you it's going to be simple we're going to we're going you're going to go to bed dreaming about there though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me hallu all right amen can you say Amen Moses standing at the Red Sea found that was the place called there that was the place the supernatural came down that was the place that God blew the Angry Eyes Of God looked see got scared and parted back right there was the place that Israel seen God loved them more than the Egyptians Daniel that there was the Lion's Den for Peter the there was come and walk on the water with me for jerus the there was the forsaking all the religious ways and all of the ways around him so that he could find the healing for his daughter so some of you are still asking where is God he's right in the middle of your he's right in the middle of your trial right in the middle of that question mark that says does God love me he's right in the middle of that question mark preachers have a call he's right in the middle of that right there where the devil is trying to tell you that you're not the Bride of Jesus Christ Satan is there in that Valley of decision but Christ is there to take you through you may be in the toughest time of your life and I've got to be good tonight I've got I've got five services that I've got to be preaching this week and I better I better start behaving instead of acting like a Pentecostal well I think somebody should just shout how Hallelujah right now well glory to God I don't think we're acting any different than what they acted on the day of we haven't went out any Windows yet Mary she was crying callling out windows hallelujah praise the Lord now Joshua was God's Great General he didn't know that he was the next general I I wonder if he realized that he was in preparation all the while sitting at the prophet's feet watching the rebellion of the church he had seen the chors and the daans and their demise but you see that was a place that God was training him for his ministry the Wilderness experience is was crucial for this great man of God there was a training and a Ming taking place and you young men listen to me a lot of people don't see the importance of coming to church on Wednesday night your pastor's not ask me to say this I'm saying this amen I maybe may I I I I so I don't nothing about this church I just got here okay but I want to tell you you men are in training and you're going to have to love God more than you love this world you're going to have to

tonight I'd be I'd make a good TV preacher oh don't you Bap to shut this hallelujah amen what that that was that was shambach when I was a kid y remember shamb Hallelujah but you see you you you see what we have is the realities of an open book Hallelujah while other young people are going out and around and playing around and Elders are playing around the scripture says very specifically forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even that much the more as you see that day [Music] approaching this is the way I look at it if you don't want I'm going to be where God wants me to be if you don't want it I'm going to where God wants me to be if no one else wants it I'm going to walk with God can you say Amen because he's taking me to my destiny and he's only going to take listen to me

Wednesday night so they're having to do games but it's good to see you young men up here playing that music tonight you're at a place called there Joshua didn't realize he was the young man playing

buddy when he got to canaan's land he was ready to lead when he seen the Giants of Canaan he still believed God when he got to canaan's land he could still hear God's words ringing in his ears only be thou strong and very courageous Joshua I will meet you there there may be an overflowing Banks of Jordan River but I'm there you're going to have to circle the walls of Jericho Joshua but I'm there with you you're going to have to take the land from the Giants of of anak but I'm there you will be well praise the Lord do you love him now how many's understanding where I'm talking about right now

this building here tonight that the devil is trying to tell you that you've not been a good parent that you've not been a good H mother you've not been a good father you've not been a good Christian but I just want to let you know right there in that Valley your God is there don't you give up your faith well praise the Lord sometimes we look at at at each other and I I I look at you and I say oh

right and we compare comparison is nothing that's not is not of God he's in his place called there I'm in my place called there David God's King he says I will meet you he had been anointed by the prophet of God while the anointing what oil was still dripping off of his head down his beard and down his garments the words were being spoke over him you're a man after God's Own Heart you are destined for the throne you will be the next king of Israel hallelujah amen glory amen amen amen but then the next 17 years amen however many years it was he was like a rabbit that was being chased from a dog he was hiding in caves Saul was jealous his armies were trying to killing it looked like everything that the that the prophet told him just was not going to happen Hallelujah but God was with him while he was hiding in those caves God was with him when he was in the valley of discouragement and God PR exal him am sir amen Joseph found that the word of the Lord tried him there in Psalms 105 and 17 and he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with feathers he was laid in Iron now listen to this until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him brother Bram says when a man lives by faith and walks by faith he is isolated from the entire world he says now you're getting into bride material you see you're getting into bride condition now he goes on down and he says he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he said say there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith I love this perfect Perfection that cannot fail well excuse me man that was a good quote that was a really good quote wonderful he's building faith faith muscles can you say Amen do you realize that this generation right here holds the promise of his coming the body change Perfection is in your grasp look to your neighbor and say are you getting this it's in our grasp and it's every little thing when God created you he took he took you you you've got I think they say like 16 elements of a little bit of calcium a little bit of sulfur little po you got some minerals and he put it all together a little of this a little of that and then when he finished there was Adam that's how he made a little bit of this and a little bit of that that's what your Prophet said take a little bit of this a little bit of that is that right and and and I and I and and I want to say that God's been working on you and and the trials that you're going through in your school the trials you go through in your job trial you go through in your family in your church wherever you are the devil does not have any authority over his over God's children I like the thoughts that God took my great great great grandfather and he worked the circumstances around for my great great great grandmother yes they had a place called there because God had a rapturing generation a rapturing generation and God had to take great great great grandpa and great great great grandma come together so great great grandma would have their personalities and come together so that they could bring Great Grandpa and Great Grandma because there is a rapturing generation that is going to hear elij Hall oh I wish I was just somebody else no don't you ever think that well I wish my teeth didn't look like that I wish I was he can say I wish I was fatter so I could look good looking like brother wend I could say I wish I

have all the bells in order to go ding ding yes sir ding ding ding ding yes sir right right we and we didn't never hit the same one twice am I making sense here tonight so so we sometimes we're here and we're thinking God can't use me here God's got you there because he wants a certain team he wants a certain sound a sound that cannot be given by anybody else I love him I love him I love him you see so God send you through all of your theirs because he wants a certain sound and God send you through all of your theirs cuz he's looking for a certain sound and he sent you through all your there and you're there all of us reflecting the Beautiful music of Amazing Grace we are God's Hallelujah music we sing Amazing Grace are amazing we sing How Great Thou Art but the world is looking at you saying there's something different about that one right can you say amen and it's because God is Not Afraid of putting you there God is Not Afraid that you're going to burn up in the fiery furnace that you're going to quit and run when the lions are roaring at you there is no running to a child of God well let me shout for a moment hallelujah hallelujah can you say amen amen amen yes so so now I'm I'm going to try to wind it down I don't even know what time it is amen I I I want us to look here I want us to look at this words you are here your build your nature your likes your dislikes your personality was all made for his special purpose Ephesians 1 11 in in whom we have obtained and in in heritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work some things huh who worketh most things who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory Philippians 1 being confident of this very thing he that has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he's still working on me to make me what I want to be took him just a week to make the moon and the stars the Earth juper and Mars how loving and patient he must be CU he's still working on me can you say Amen there really ought to be a sign upon my heart don't judge me yet there's an unfinished part I'll be perfect just according to his plan he's the Potter and I'm the clay something like that can you say Amen brother Brandon and I I I want to bring this in and I and and and um thank you so much for allowing me to come this has been a ball over here preaching for y'all brother brandom says he says I love nature I get that from my Mama she's a half Indian and the new birth never took that out of me he said now I'm a little Melancholy that's the Irish side of me get the Molly grubs and high tempered that that that part of the family one time he he had asked says what's wrong with me why can't I be like everybody else he says they can go out and hunt and they shoot squirrels they're shooting them in the legs and the body knocking tails off and all of that he says me I I I let the squirrel get out 50 yards and then I shoot him in the eye and if I miss the eye it tears me up why am I that way he would ask that question and I look at it this side I'm I'm 60 something years past when the prophet has has died God built that man to be an Elijah and he made him as straight as straight can be because you and I were going to need him can you say Amen oh do you see that brother brother brother Bram would ask and I I've I've Got U um and he talks about him him him preaching so hard he says I asked my wife the other morning honey have I lost my senses am I becoming a mad man what's the matter with me why do I say these things I do what do I do the things I do for what makes me I love people and yet just rip them apart I fast and pray to get rid of it the more I fast and pray the worse it comes incredible but it's true it's true we understand is because God had to bring that Elijah to bring this third pool Ministry to us aren't you glad for that I say here tonight I there has been places called there and I I I have a bunch more in my notes and and uh but I I I got too happy jumping around and so I can't finish my message but brother brandham this is the truth he says I you're going to do that first pool and he tells him about the hand then he says and if you there'll come a time if you'll be sincere you'll be able to read the heart then there was a it was a it was a constant marching forward I don't none of us grow discouraged because God is moving in a mighty mighty [Music] way can you say Amen how many's going to love him right where you are Hallelujah don't you don't you be looking at that fiery furnace door
