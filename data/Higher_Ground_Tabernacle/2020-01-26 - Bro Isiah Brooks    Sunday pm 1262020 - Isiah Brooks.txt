[Music] in the way [Music] see [Music] [Applause] [Music] ooh Oh may my love Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] I wonder [Music] Hey we appreciate you tonight or today or this evening how we want to say it I'm not gonna keep you long I know you've been waiting for me and waiting on me oh by the grace of God I wanted to start on a little series but I'll have to wait I was gonna startled the Book of Revelations but I think I'm gonna hold off and just Minister a thought here by God's grace and I trusted it'll be a blessing to you in Jesus Christ's name you love the Lord I hope and trust that you had a wonderful service this morning amen we appreciate everything that the Lord is doing by the grace of God if you would turn with me though to the Book of Revelations thank God for the musician I both of them appreciate our March I brother Mario and Amy and everybody like he said who helped us with these chairs for some reason I forgot when you order stuff they do not come assembled so we had a little task and by the grace of God we did the best that we could and so to God be all the glory we just had only a few chairs that I lack in the back of them I bagged and I just assumed they're going to send them to us at a later date but anyway Revelation is 22 i I believe and I said this to the church this morning down in Iowa City I just believe that we're living in the last days I am more convinced now than ever before not because of all of the things that the world is going through and they are they're going through a lot of turmoil and you know it's falling apart but it's the church that I'm looking at because this is a time that we supposed to be on fire Jesus said I would that you be hot or cold lukewarm you get spewed out and it just seems like I see more lukewarmness that I do fire not saying that God is not going to catch us a fire they go go to forsake us he will not but I think if we come to a place where we understand that we have a ministry and this ministry cannot be done without Christ and Christ must have a place amen to work through and that place that he has chosen to work through is us so revelations 22 beginning at the seventeenth verse and the spirit and the bride says come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely I love that because he says water not waters one water one life one God let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and all that you do for us Lord we pray father God all of the things that we are lacking father that you would give us grace to overcome Lord be merciful to us we are your seed we call upon your name and in your name we trust in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as I was saying this morning you don't have to be anything in this world for God to use you God has already predetermined those who he has chosen to do specific works now the works in which God has called us to do may not necessarily be that thing that we hope to do like many of us wish we were musicians many of us wish we could sing many of us wish you know we always have that desire to do other things that God has not ordained us to do and so sometimes it's very difficult for us to settle down in the place in which God has ordained us to be in and you know that's what the Holy Ghost is here for because when the Holy Ghost comes in your life he positionally places you in the position in which you should be in I was reading by God's grace second Kings 5:1 through 27 and we all know about the leopard call naman now naman amen was a Syrian and he was a rich man he was an intelligent man but one of the things that naman had he had leprosy but you see none of us would have known who naman was because he wasn't of the Jewish faith but he was a Gentile and the Bible tells us that there was a little girl who had no name there is no name given to her she was not what we would have looked upon as being royalty but in the story she literally represents the bride because she had a ministry and the thing about it because layman would have never known that God has sent a prophet or that when there was a prophet in the land had not been for this young lady hallelujah and you know what God never did give her a name hallelujah so you see by God's grace it's not important to have a name the most important thing is to know that you are written or your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and so here was naman who represented the Gentile and Gentile Church Amen that God had led this girl to say hey you having issues but I know there's a prophet in the land that I know that if he pray for you this leprosy will be undone and it's like just just like looks people you know a lot of people don't even like the idea of being baptized but it doesn't matter whether you like it or not God says you must be baptized and you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but there are people who says no I'd rather be sprinkled why do I have to get baptized because God said so now naman could have said like Moses Moses Moses you're holy ground take off your shoes you are a holy ground what if Moses would have said up I take my hat off instead it never would have worked because God told Moses take off your shoes you understand what I'm going see because I want you to understand we are preparing to meet the Lord and in order to meet the Lord you and I must be in order his order not ours and we're going to find out that as we climb the letter on a letter or the steps of a perfect man the thing that hinders us from reaching the top is self will self will because that was nameless problem.we lord why can't I go over here a dip in this this this this particular River or the other river but God didn't say the other river he said Jordan because Jordan was a symbolic of judgment you're seeing is judged and therefore it is also symbolic of death you must die to yourself can I say like this seven times in order to be complete hey man if you got fear you can't have fear and faith at the same time so fear must die faith in order for faith to live so what happens eventually name and goals and he's he's literally he's dipping in this this water seven times now I want you to understand that Elijah's ministry was also a Ministry of the resurrection it was a Ministry of Resurrection it was a Ministry of restoration is that right because Elijah spirit went off Elijah and went into Elijah and Remer will remember in Elijah's are oh they were out there working and one man was cutting down a tree but the axe head fell off into the water right and what he did to the property told Elijah what had happened and what happened he logic cut a piece of steak off threw it into water and the axe head floated back up and the young man was able to get the axe head back she was a it was a restoration is that right but in Elijah's ministry it was also a Ministry of resurrection it was a Ministry of life because naman typed out the sinner he had leprosy and leprosy is a type of sin and seven church ages a man was represented in this one man's action by different seven times hallelujah every age had to die to their own way in order for us to come where we are in this age we are up there hallelujah in that age but you and I must dip seven times we must die - so veil to our will now I want you to know where your we're the strongest of your wheel lays within your flesh because it's your flesh that keeps you away from God it hides God from you that's what Paul said you must kill him you must die daily not every other day not every week every day you must kill him in order for Christ to live in you in a greater way hallelujah you love the Lord so what happens when name and after he he dips into the Jordan seven times he comes up and his flesh is brand new like a baby fresh brand new it was a type of the resurrection he went up went down up and down seven times he comes up amen and he's brand new it shows that this age because we're under the Elijah age when we did die to ourselves we have a resurrection that will give us a new body hallelujah now I'm just working with this just for the moment because I want you to understand that in this season same season you got a servant by the name of Gaza and Ganesha amen was a man who followed the Prophet around all the time he was a servant let's say he was one of the ministers of the message of Elijah and the thing about it is instead of following through with Elijah's message he wanted to get paid for it you see here's what all present was what are you saying that is the danger because understand that while God was allowing the restoration of Naamans body that's been his way as he was restoring the body of Jesus Christ guy haze' had his line on money that was the will of man he saw the will of God go free you owe me nothing but in his ministry Gaza runs after Mammon and says what can you offer me now putting it in our terms why are you saying that because you've got to find out that every every step you make will be your will versus God will God will never take your will from you you have to submit your will to God is that right even Jesus Christ when he was there in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die to his own will and he says Lord not my will but thine be done it was in the garden that he gained the victory not on Calvary it was in the God he gained the victory therefore the victory was given to him in Calvary but he had to pray through father I don't want to do this but I see that your word requires me to do this nevertheless not my will but thine be done you understand that so when you see by God's grace that your will amen must come in junction with God's will in order to please God I spoke this this morning and I was talking about how David's men Davis at all if I could just have me a drink of water David never offered that water uh-uh you know ask his servants or his soldiers to get water but according to the private god he says even a high says the desires of God should become a commandment to us hallelujah just o desire and that those two men thought they meant through 15 miles 15 I ain't talking about running I'm not even talking about walking they thought 15 miles to bring gave it a glass of water think about it if we compete that serious about God being long time to church now most of us don't have that problem but my poor ear being on time to church being of service of God winning are just you know there's things that needed to be around need to be done around church and we fail to do it because we want somebody to ask listen that's not the right way when you see the desires of God because the Word of God plainly tells us what he's looking for it ought to be everyman zeal to take that that desire and make it a commandment before God what did David do after they fought themselves it fought all the way 15 miles to get David a drink of water he liked type he typed Christ and he took that glass of water and he poured it on the ground thank God for that hallelujah you know what he was doing that was a free will offering that was a that offering was made win when they pierced him in the side and out came water and blood it was a type of Christ think about it when David was climbing that mountain and that little crippled man be getting slapped him and kicked him or whatever spit on him and called him a dog and then just one of David's soldiers were getting ready to take his head off is that right David said don't touch him God told him to do it how many of us would have done that hallelujah well he denied his own will you don't think he was embarrassed you don't think the pain was there but somehow David was in the spirit of God and he recognized this man could not have done that had not God allowed him to do it you see what I'm saying dying to your will means on your job in your school in your home in your church everywhere you and I are being tested right now everywhere we go my will of God's will hallelujah this is no matter where whatever you do whosoever will die like that because God knows those who were in his mind you understand me and when God get ready to summons you you got to go hallelujah you don't know why you have to move but you got to move I still marvel when Jesus began to pick his disciples some on their jobs and doing this and done that doing the other dropping their nets quitting a job leaving their homes to follow Jesus but there were some ins I need you I need you and some he just called my name and they followed see you when God gets the summers in you y'all know what that means it means that God has an appointed time for you and he has a place where you need to be at a certain time because he's going to be there so when God summons you huh you you understand what I'm saying it's what we must understand but how how are we going to know is God is like this simple my sheep hear with my voice and a stranger they will not follow you don't happen and when God calls you or summons you to do something it does not mean that everybody else is going to hear the call everybody else is not gonna even see what you see it's just like when Saul was on his way to Damascus is that right and the light shine from heaven hallelujah knocked him off the horse what happened everybody didn't see what Paul saw not today hear what Paul heard it was Paul's time God summons him and you know what the first thing Saul wanted to know who art thou Lord he wanted to know who God was you think Saul ever had a problem with knowing that he wasn't God that might sound like really weird but listen let me put it this way Saul knew that he was called by God he understood who that pilla fire art you understand me and he called him Lord we remember I read the quote last week but all the stars but I said we stars right and their stars we play our part at night but when the rising of the Sun he said we we dishonor ourselves in other words we move out the way right we move out the way why because we don't want to get the glory that the Sun is going to get we blend in with the sunlight the stars are still there but it's no longer the Stars time it's the sun's time that's why the prophet of God preached the rising of the Sun he was moving on the way and he was denying himself that we might see Jesus who's the true Son of God even nature teaches us that and I don't know why people have so much so much a hard time let me tell you something I can't help but to worship the man who saved me hallelujah you love the Lord now my point is the flesh must be conquered because it's in the flesh where the self will really works who you and I are made out of three parts right body soul and spirit you understand me and when we understand what we are and who we are just like I said this morning amen how many y'all know that Jesus is not on the throne in heaven and where he where is he there he's in your heart I went trying to do a trick question but the the throne of God is in your heart this is where he wants to be enthroned is that right he should not come down he said a confident I've got to go away but another comforter shall come remember I told you that the other day I said that comforter is like a UH a Georgian you attorneys you're an attorney he's there to comfort you that you're kicking has already been paid hallelujah you don't worry about anything you just keep pressing through the veil keep denying yourself don't let your flesh have a picnic kill it it is your greatest enemy brother Brennan said not the devil you your body y'all know what I tell I said this all the time if I didn't have this body I'd be perfect my greatest battles come because of this hallelujah he says now remember there was a veil a veil that hang between the holy and the Holies of holy in the Holies of holy is where Christ comes to sit down on your hearts throne Christ is enthroned he come through justification sanctification and then bye-bye one church no by one creed no by one spirit from here we are baptized into one body which is the body of Christ hallelujah who comes in Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal whosoever will meaning that this is for whosoever will and that means whosoever will ready to die is that right jesus said first of all in order to be my disciples you must take up your cross and follow me meaning you got to die daily in order to follow me hallelujah you know God is a God of variety and God just doesn't we can't program him and he's not going to allow us to program him God speaks the way he wants to speak sometimes he gives us witnesses oh I I know God showed me yeah and sometimes he doesn't hallelujah he does his own because let me say it God will never allow us to ever put him in a box you understand me it comes to a place that we must understand when the spirit leads you you must go in the way that the spirit leads hallelujah these senses that we have deceives us these sis's that we have sometimes becomes our very enemy the senses of our spirit and the senses of our flesh our eyesight the way we feel oh I don't think I like that that has nothing to do with it hallelujah because you do not have to like it in order for to be right hallelujah think about it when God Jesus himself had to go by the woman at the well hallelujah oh my he knew that if anybody would see him there there will be critics but he was willing because the Spirit of the Lord led him that way he said I have need to go by Samaria hallelujah and he went by Samaria and brother Branham picks it up he said his disciples were looking through the bushes like what in the world is he doing talking to that kind of a woman but you see when God leads you to do something you've got to do it and guess what God always put opposition he never makes it easy he always puts something in the way but that is a suicide that God wants you to do something that right he told Moses I want you to deliver the children hallelujah never told him that Janice and Jambres was going to be there to oppose him hallelujah never told him that Janice and Jambres weren't going to have serpents - never told him never told him that jealous and Jambres was going to be able to do it a lot of the signs and wonders that he did they were able to do everything Moses did except create love coming to that because I preached on the voice this morning I didn't get to preach it like I wanted to but I want you to understand this is why it is important to press on behind the video it's important because that is where you need the Shekinah glory hallelujah and that Shekinah glory lives because that is where God is hallelujah if you want to look like God act like God talk like God walk like God you smell like God you got to get behind the veil Oh somebody help me here you saw what are you trying to tell me brother brush your wheel is the thing that you have to battle every day in order to get behind the veil and stay there see sometimes you can go behind there and you forget and you come back out the prophet of God said you can go in and out but he says at some point in time you did get there and closed the door behind you now I come back out why because you want God to the living you listen oh let me hurry up let me hurry up with this because I want you to know Amen that veil but the velum said is called self will do you get it the picture now the sense is out there the senses on your body the senses of your soul and the veil between that and the Holies our place the Holies of Holies and the only way that you can get there is to have self will what whosoever will that means you must have a will to move up to faith you must have a will to move up to knowledge you must have a will you must be determined and all that God can make you determine but you must be determined hallelujah that's what makes it fire because fire is determined a mented to conquer everything in his path hallelujah somebody help me here you and I must understand by God's grace hallelujah a wheel it ain't about shaking hands it's not about immersion it's not about joining church it's not about passing out let us know sir whosoever will beyond the veil hallelujah if you willing to go beyond the veil hallelujah put on the harm of God fight your way all the way hallelujah glory to God is that right you got a fight don't let these look Wong Christians stop you hallelujah because every age must produce the word of prophecy the word has been spoken of the age must come to life it must live [Applause] God is summoning us the Bible says many are called but few are chosen is that right listening the revelation book of Revelation chapter 42 he said oh my when those books were open then you saw thousands upon thousands hallelujah and we know he said the sleeping virgins Oh can't you see that the sleep in church them that went out to meet the bridegroom they let the oil go out of their lamp never entered into this never let Christ take control so he could work miracles and speak with tongues and do wonders and things super brute to prove that he lived in the church they never let God take control and this is where we are fighting your will and God's will will you allow him to take full control God don't want part of you he wants all of you hallelujah help us Jesus is that Alright oh my I'm not gonna be long he said let Christ come to those senses say well I ought to I don't want to I don't like to go to hell see that's not right I want one thing I joined the church alright Luke well see tell you what I believe that I ought to live a different life what I can st. if I say vacation at the altar you see no no no no all right all those things alright but then whosoever will let him pass the ribbon veil o Lord of God I on the other side hallelujah to his name-o whosoever will let him tear it down the curtain of his own will you gotta tell the curtain of your own will your will your will will make you put you in a place and then that the Word of God don't even affect you anymore because you've harden your heart too many times may the foolish later lord have mercy upon us is that right we've got the conch of the flesh it's not something that we've never heard before but I believe this is the time and season that we must learn and we you can't get there without pray huh it doesn't matter Paul says listen you can understand all the mysteries in and that's what scares me because I see many of people everywhere I go they know the depth of the word but they ain't living nothing daddy ain't gonna work Marion's a people follow the Prophet hallelujah but they had the wrong spirit is that right that moment they complain chef will got a hold of him I want this I want that this is not enough it ain't good enough hallelujah God said I'm tired of that generation ramen and complaining and don't realize how blessed they were thus using go wear out the clothes didn't tear up they had plenty of food hallelujah and they steer complained complaining will keep you out of the kingdom if it kept Moses beast you know that children of Israel out of the promised land it would keep you out of the promised land there is no way that you're gonna get into the Holy Ghost complaining hallelujah it's like a man coming coming home and his wife has got a rollers in her head and all of this kind of stuff looking like she just woke up and got out of the bed and all she can do is say honey I got a honey-do list for you do you think he's gonna be excited to see her you think she's gonna be like whoa honey you looking really good today ha ha but if she's got herself ready if she's prepared herself if she's prepared the house and everything else so that when he comes home he's looking at a beautiful woman all she got to do is smile at him and he said honey what you won't that's a real man now I'm just trying to say this is what we do with God we constantly complain let me tell you something most of the time when people say I'm hungry they lie most people don't even know what hungry is we just need we say oh I desire to eat because hungry is when you haven't eaten in a few days anybody know what I'm talking about I know what that is his brother oh yeah that's what real hunger is you saw hungry if you drank water to hurt your stomach that that's what real hunger is I've been there so so you know people can't ever what brother Brooks you've been no I know what that is and so is it with God listen is that right you and I must understand that what God is doing he's trying to get us to see that we must be the reflecting light of God in the church we must be if God is on the throne anybody no apple tree or anybody know what we look like you can't you can't deceive a man who knows what we is and what a kookabura is the man know the difference the nature of the tree is different is that right you know the difference we can't say we brought if there's no reflection of him what's the difference I preached a message years ago in imitation of life and and I dealt with the plastic flowers they do it they do it they work with the material now and the flowers look so real they look so real you got to touch him you ever seen a flower like that man-made flower and it looks so real it deceives your eye so well that you got to look go over there and touch him to make you see whether they real or not yeah that's how it is with churches but the difference between the make believer and that one that's imitating it can never reproduce y'all hear what I'm saying this message is supposed to reproduce we supposed to be bearing children unto the Lord is that right Eve was supposed to bring forth a meander the offspring of God New Jerusalem supposed to be the lover of the church and we are New Jerusalem but it's Christ in us you are now the sanctuary of God when God has been thrown himself in you but what we fail to see is that we've allowed Satan to deceive us with religion and so we get complacent within ourselves and think that oh by God's grace I'm gonna make it let me say it like this if you miss the rapture I said this this morning if you missed the rapture the day of mercy is over for you so this is not a time to play with God if you should miss the rapture you have to appear before the white throne judgment and you can scream and holler God mercy no mercy for you why because the blood is off the mercy seat hallelujah if you're not where you should be you and I we all should be crying out to God make me better Lord I want to be more like you help me be diligent lord that's my mind sharp so that when Satan comes to tell me I choose your will over mouth help us Lord hallelujah hallelujah we can't even afford to allow a bitter root of bitterness to be in us hallelujah god don't have space for selfishness Oh hallelujah the Holy Ghost amen as we approach that Holies of Holies and then you understand we're justified is that right but as we sanctify it that's that song become holy holy holy unto the it's the walk of the Christian is what we supposed to be doing every day I walk should be holy holy holy unto the Lord and as I think I brother Keith and I were talking Amen with God eyes become eyes his veil is the Holy Spirit and we see holiness we're seeing in itself and then won't touch us that's where I want to be I'm not saying I'm there but I press toward the mark like Paul say I'm gonna get there ain't nothin gonna stop me you gotta have that determination you gotta have that that mindset if I'm the only one hallelujah I'm gonna make it hallelujah is that right not through some Bishop not through nothin else but from the throne of God by our revelation of the power of his resurrection making him the same yesterday today and forever that's what Paul said I don't just want to know him in his suffering I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know everything about the man I love and the man that I married hallelujah is that Alright making him the same yesterday in the day forever what seven stars standing there reflecting that light there's a kind of light from the Shekinah glory from the Holies of holy seven lamps on fire sitting on top of these candlesticks reflecting his light his color and of his power and of his direction right into the church when I was thinking about the beautiful rainbow when I was thinking about what Christ did he did something it's amazing how Jesus was born in a manger but the bride was born on Calvary he gave birth to her on top of the mountain Oh hallelujah so in order you talking about birth pains you talk about birth pains he went through some birth pains hallelujah by the time he got up there to Calvary Amen by the time they crucified Him Amen even historian says he didn't even look like a man do you understand it he was so disfigured so large so beaten amen and who was it for you and I every lick he got you and I cause that he died for our sins you understand me thank the prophet of God said those old mothers out there when they were having birth they gave birth to those mothers and whatever name Amen they uttered out their mouth that's what they were called he from Manasseh and you know how you were born on Calvary when Jesus uttered the words will Father forgive them for they know not what they do and a true bride member has the ability to forgive somebody helped me hear your birth under forgiveness you understand forgiveness that's how the church went through is that right it showed it was all because when Stephen was being stoned to death he said Lord hold not these things in their charge you'll never see a real born again believer cursing Lord get that fella in her mouth is always forgive them she can't help it see she she's dare to her wheel it's not like it's not like Abel Abel wanted revenge his blood cried out revenge me avenge me it's like the Jews Lord how long and they only do that because the blood of Jesus Christ has not been applied hallelujah but when the real blood of Jesus Christ is applied hallelujah the life of Christ comes upon you you act like him you love like him you forgive like him you are suffer like him and your whole being is about doing the Father's will is that okay the spirit and the bride say come it's a shame Lord forgive us Lord forgive us there's so much work to be done but self and self will it's clogged our minds on what we've been called to do we have a commission go ye out there you say old Brotherhood's well a harlot about it ain't your business but my sheep hears my voice if you go out there and God and use your voice to summons them hmm I have a need to go by Samaria is that right brother Branham was so caught up with God amen he walked off that plane and God said keep on walking I love that he didn't care about his next appointment oh I might mr. brain that thought came to his mind but he heard the voice of God said keep walking that wasn't just for profit people they that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God how many of us would have stood on the corner God says go over there and stand on the corner this certain lady is gonna come by he stood there until she got there not five minutes not 10 minutes but it was a time that she had to wait there we would say well you know perhaps that wasn't them maybe that wasn't God hmm we let our reasoning get in the way but my sheep hear with my voice is this okay I'm almost done I wasn't gonna be long but I want to get over to you tonight that the divorce of God amen who talked to Joshua how many y'all God talks to you he talks to me I'm serving the Living God he talks to me and I talk to him if your God is not talking to you you better check it out somewhere it means something is wrong because God will talk to you he summons you when he wants you to do things he tells you what to do he doesn't leave you wondering but that comes through praying and fasting that comes to a place where you have become your relationship has become intimate with God I'm a close in just a moment as I said you do not have to be a well-known person in order for God to use you I talked about the young lady that that that led name until Elijah and what about that old Shunammite woman huh she was summons and listened God took Elijah to her she was about ready to die she and her sons but it was her appointed time for salvation y'all hear me and when it's your time for salvation or to move up the ladder she was a believer already she was ready to die she was willing to die but every time you know I used this particular story because for some reason when I thought about the shunammite woman in my earlier days I thought she's a big momma you know I thought you know she nothing I didn't realize that she was really starving for some reason it wasn't clicking my mind but you got to understand these people probably was so thin in their appearance because she said we're gonna eat this last meal and we're going to die that means they have been starving for a long time you understand me so you can understand the whole pitch of this thing that's what God will do he'll come at a time when you think you all in control and he'll ask you for your last huh oh he said to Abraham sacrifice Isaac here take the thing that means so much to you and we want to see whether you gonna give it to him the thing that is most important is the kind of thing that God will ask for what's more valuable to you than anything other than your will and God say kill it you got to give that up in order to go my way whoo and guess what here it was like I said God takes this woman give me give make my cake first and and I don't know like I said he works on both ends cuz had not he worked with that Shunammite woman it would have been some trouble but God worked on both ends she perceived that this was a man of God and I better go do what he says do right now think about wheel nothing to say something here and I may have got you the shoot of my woman and the other lady big stuff but anyway my point is even when Elijah had given this woman a son she was determined right they sent all of the trinket self of the Prophet to her laid this on the bed laid that on the bed but no she wanted the real thing and she told her servant don't you stop you see what I'm saying till I get to the Prophet now let me bring this to you don't you stop til you get to the Prophet you understand me you don't stop to you coming to a full statue of Christ you can't play with it you can't come to a place and I'm saying these things because there are times in my life I've got laxed yeah I've got laxed but now God is saying this is not a time to be latch redeem your time hurry like the brother sent me and I had seen that earlier they said it's 100 seconds to midnight because of the global warming the atomic bombs diseases just like that that new disease in China you know a brother called me said don't you know they lying to us then shutting down no country because 50 or 60 people he said there have been over 7,000 people that have died about this flu and to know that that virus is now in America is that right oh don't be afraid brother branham said it like this he said you know there going to be a disease that will eat you while you are alive and the only way that you'll be able to escape this is that you have the sealing of the Holy Ghost that's how close we are they're developing all of these germs and diseases and there's a warfare people because we got too many people and they don't know how to kill us off without destroying the world what we going to do when I see the blood I'll pass over you that's it it can't be a figment of our imagination we must have it living reality in our lives is that right hallelujah let me let me say it like this in closing when God created us he knew exactly where we would be at whatever time God has never lost track on where you are he doesn't have to turn over leaves and look through a box or some trash bag even though we were there God knows exactly where we and when he gets to calling you right that means when God calls you never gonna understand I know it because it was Peters his Lord we don't left everything we don't left our mothers our fathers our sisters our brothers everything lot we don't have nothing left now what are we gonna get in return then I almost sound like a selfish but if it had been self as Jesus would have rebuked him but he didn't he says no I don't give it to you I'm gonna give all this to you plus some troubles with it yeah you want to know what you're gonna get because this is a place where I have chosen to perfect you you understand me when we get on the other side all of this will never be seen again no this flesh that we're now living in won't be so everything that's fallen will dissipate and disappear go back to where it used to be I can't imagine it but I know it's true and the thing that people will lose heaven because they didn't want to lose their will ain't nobody gonna control me but let me tell you something God is too here to Christ and Christ is the head of the church and the woman ain't the head of nothin that sounds rough but that's the way it works Christ is our head and we are his bride and we must submit to his word mm well my wife knows she loves me but my point is faint saints of God I know I screamed it out because my voice is kind of going but I won't I'm just trying to tell you in just short short little message help us Lord that when we say Lord my will die and be done we mean it from the deaths of our heart because it is the heart cries that God hears he doesn't care about intellectual prayers or intellectual dis and I'm just saying that to myself because sometimes you just know what to say sometimes you figure if I say it like this it's going to work no it doesn't work that way what comes from the heart touches the heart hallelujah every prayer everything we do must be done in the spirit has to be if it's not done in the spirit it's not acceptable before God hallelujah and so we you and I must understand that it is important people say people and and I am closing because I said lord I don't know about you maybe I'm losing my mind which would be a good thing to do but I believe this message I got a sneeze sorry I believe this message and I believe everything God said happened you know Jesus spoken up over eight hundred years before he came up when he came he fit the scripture think about Ezekiel Ezekiel salt twenty-four Thrones but he didn't see the people in the phones but then John is caught up into Revelation caught up into a different time caught up into this day after the rapture and he sees 24 elders but though thought those wrongs were created for them they sitting on those Thrones right now nothing could alter that God wasn't going to go back and erase the names on the seats hallelujah you understand me and so is it with the bride of Jesus Christ and God when he called those elders those patriarchs did you know and we know this this is why we must come to that perfection because we are the judge we are the judge with Christ hallelujah we're the ones amen that white robes just doesn't mean and clean white rose is also symbolic of being a judge and so God will have us judging well and then those twelve tribes did twelve elders did you know they would be the ones judging the twelve tribes hallelujah the Jews as great as they were and our will be in the outer Court there'll be the guard the temple guards and here we are the bride so how can we come up short he's not gonna let us come up short and one thing I know about God he loves if you were sheep you want to be loud and not driven I want God to lead me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake whatever it takes you know and and understand in order to get where we need to go there's a lot of suffering ahead people want to follow Christ but they don't want to suffer but just like brother Branham said and I'll say it just like him I want some battle scars I don't want to get up there and be clean so clean I ain't got one scar nothing to show that I've been in a battle yes battles they hurt it's rough sometimes you seem like you're standing by yourself but staying anyhow fight the good fight of faith and I don't say like this don't be a shame of this gospel when you preach Jesus you preach it the whole book is that right he's the prophet of all prophets he's the fulfillment of all prophets hallelujah like I try to tell people I said understand this and I know it's a fine line but I don't even be looking for stuff and brother and the Lord will show me something that even the Prophet says that makes me stand even more firmer on what I believe and that is I'm gonna always worship Jesus Christ in a pure way you understand me God is in me God is in you crisis and me Christ is in you is that right a member who gets the glory when somebody's healed who gets the glory when somebody's delivered you understand me who gets the glory if you get the glory then you are wrong and if you allow people to give you the glory Paul said I ain't died for none of y'all don't baptized in my name hmm I didn't do that I only know one that did that and that's Jesus Christ what happened it wasn't that the glory of God wasn't on him he was in the Shekinah he did mighty works but he said I don't know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified I don't know I don't even know how come I have to keep saying this but I'm gonna tell you something I know what I'm working with the cause in my opinion just a small little change to make a vast difference the Bible said even in the last days they were worship the creature more than the Creator less there may be I'm going fanatical I don't know but I know if we're gonna have a revival Jesus Christ must be restored among us in such a way that the world would see that he's the same yesterday today and forever God must live to us this is not religion this is salvation this is what what God has ordained us to be word about word upon word on word expression expressed God and you Amazing Grace will always be my song the brain or it was when that brought my liberty I [Music] we are [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we'll always rush all [Music] load [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
