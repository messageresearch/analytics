TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen we thank the Lord for you this evening running just a little bit behind but uh we do thank the Lord for bringing us here by the grace of God and uh we do thank the Lord for all of you who are who made it uh your choice to be here amen let's stand and just have a word of prayer please our Heavenly Father God as we come before you Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we pray that you forgive us and cleanse us from all our unrighteousness today oh Lord we have been so busy Lord doing things that Lord just uh just took us oh God but Lord we thank you for what you've done for us and giving our brother aliser safe flight oh God to Tucson and Lord we thank you for the word that we have previously received through him we pray our father that the word that has been sown would uh bring forth a hundredfold in our lives bless the little bible study Lord as we approach the word of God we pray that you will sanctify to the to our our hearts oh God make it a part of us and father please speak the words that you would have us to know tonight we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I want to entitle this little session uh by the grace of God the season of Vengeance the season of vengeance and the reason why I'm I'm bringing this out like this is because we know uh when we read Jeremiah we see so many of the things that uh God uh did through uh brother brandham Malachi 4 so I wanted to read that just to start it off tonight Malachi 4 5-6 we're going to read that we know also that uh Malachi 4 expresses a a a a different Elijah than the one uh Malachi 3 uh speaks of Malachi 3 speaks of John the Baptist and Malachi 45 speaks of Jesus I mean brother brand I excuse me I'm sorry the Elijah that will come in this day so we appreciate God and all that he's doing and has done for us and I just thank God because that one scripture uh Hebrews 13 and8 that declares Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever uh really uh it balances out uh the Bible in the sense that we understand that God cannot change he cannot change uh what he was yesterday and he is today and what he was and what he is today he will be forever more we love the character of God this is why we read the Bible we to come to better understand God's character things that he like and the things that he does not like as we read Malachi 4:5 starting at the fifth verse it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the father to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now we know what God has done um and we know that this Elijah following him comes the destruction of the world and even as Jeremiah dealing with the Jews we we spoke many times and told you how Jeremiah was elected by God he was a prophet uh so much so that God told Jeremiah that he knew him before he was conceived received in his mother's womb and um so we know by God's grace that Jeremiah was a true prophet of God but you see in the days of Jeremiah he had a lot of unbelievers because Jeremiah prophesied and things like that it did not say that the people believed him and it's always that way Jesus says a prophet is without honor in his own country often times people don't see what the prophet is being is said staying until the prophet has gone off the scene and we know that to be true Jesus uh was in just a small space uh what we call Palestine I mean the whole world didn't see him the whole world knew nothing about his crucifixion and the things that he went through the whole of the world never knew he had 12 disciples and those things I mean it was after the death of Christ we came to understand who he really was I mean it was that way even with his disciples they followed him three and A2 years and it was after his death they truly believe and receive that he was the Messiah of that day so is it with brother brandom many of the people that followed him they claimed they believed him but they did not and many of them didn't understand who he was until after he had passed away and gone but there is always that Remnant that God always deal with so I want to say this by the grace of God every nation that God raised up to destroy Israel God didn't come back around and he judged that Nation for doing so uh that's the way it is and we know that Babylon was a real great City during that time they had great Kings and and and everything but every one of those kings everyone that God raised up God brought down and it was all because of Israel and God being just so I want say this we never want God Justice we always want his mercy and Grace now Jeremiah had prophesied a lot of things he even told zedekiah he would be destroyed he would be killed zedekiah was a king and he was a king of unbelief he he just did not believe the Prophecies of and I'm a reason why I'm not reading right now it because I'm trying to summarize the things before I go further this book is a great book and and it's has a lot of things in it but anyway um and zedar when when the king came uh Nebuchadnezzar came and everything else uh zedekiah was not only killed uh brought before the king uh excuse me I'm sorry but his sons were killed in in the face of the king as NE uh as uh Jeremiah prophesied that they would be and zedekiah eyes were pled out a't that amazing uh he had eyes to see but because he couldn't see the prophet uh God had his eyes plucked out by Babylon in other words he went into darkness and the word of God Jedi means uh the Lord is just and and that's what happened God God's justice fell on zedekiah who was really like a shadow type of the day that we're living in lead deia uh because Israel had become so bad it was terrible that God said they their hearts were like iron and and and and and and as hard as a diamond and so you got to understand a diamond is a very hard thing it's not something that could be easily broken crushed or or or it takes a diamond to cut a diamond so we find out that God couldn't even reach them even in the time that God started with uh Jeremiah he told Jeremiah he said uh I'm going to cause you to preach to these people but they hard hard-hearted and and and they won't listen they're not going to listen and because they not going to listen basically I've sent prophets I've seen all kinds of witnesses before Israel but the more I sin the more hardened they become the more they become more like the world now I want to ask a question before I go any further what was one of the main reason why God didn't want Israel to mix with the other tribal people anybody know ID idolatry was one of them that's true it was their lifestyle these people were so wicked they were so filthy they had all manner of diseases running through their bodies according to history and all of these diseases were brought upon them because of their sexual activities they had gods that that uh uh that Worship in the way of origes and you know I heard a description people said well I'm pansexual and I didn't know what that was until today and pansexual means you you as a person will have sex with anything a horse a dog a cat it just doesn't uh just doesn't um the boundaries is just not men or women it there is no boundaries and we know that's exactly what happened in the days of Sodom that's what happened in the days of Noah and is and and as long as Israel kept mixing with these kind of people that's why God said don't marry them because they had sexual diseases that would be transferred into the blood that would cause blindness remember when that man was blind and and and they asked Jesus who did Sin see that was one of the reasons because uh uh these things were transferred to Israel and Israel was many of them were sick because of their mixture and mixing with the neighbors uh PE neighborhood people and tribes and things like that now I say all of this to bring you to a place when when the cup of the amorites are full that means everybody is so polluted in the natural that there is no ter turning back now why would you say that so if you can see where America is now the cup is almost full I mean you search to to I can't even say it search the record and you find out that venal disease is on a rapid but people don't care and what they don't understand is a curse it's a judgment is the Vengeance of the Lord that they are now partaking in and we we we look at these things it's as as if it's nothing and I'm going to say it like this Solomon said there's no new thing under the sun and we come to the end where the cup of the amorites is is about full I mean it's not only have they mixed so much in the natural uh sense of lust but they have mixed uh churches and and all of these things and and the Bible said two can't walk together except they be agreed and so we find out that this is what Israel was doing they and and believe you or not believe but what was God doing with Israel he was breaking them and in reality he was preserving them he literally beat them and chasen them as children and locked them up in Babylon so they had no way especially to to spread diseases or for diseases to be spread to them that's right and God preserved them uh by way of the king God said told to Israel by Jeremiah if you if you allow King Nebuchadnezzar to take you go down to Babylon serve him you'll be serving him for 70 years I will preserve you and I will bring you out and that's what he did look at the anointing that God put on Shadrach mesach and abedo right they were determined not to do what defile themselves they weren't going to defile themselves with food they weren't going to defile themselves with women they weren't going to defile themselves by worshiping any other God they had determined within themselves they would stay righteous because they knew that was the reason why they was in Babylon because they had began to worship idols and everything else and forgot about God and the Judgment comes to the king of Babylon as well as as as I said so one thing of certain also God brings in Moab in this and when I was reading about Moab I thought about around the 48 49th chapter around the 50 God talks about Moab and how God is going to destroy and chasen Moab now you got to realize that God is calling all of these kind of names and you got to understand that all is the Lords and God can do what he wants to do he raised up a nation he brings them down he use them for this as a a vessel of honor and then he comes around and and destroy the vessel of Honor yall understand I mean dishonor excuse me now so I want to I want to come and bring you all the way up because I I am I'm skipping a lot but let's get down by the grace of God let's come to uh Jeremiah the 50th chapter Jeremiah 50 and as I said a lot of things have taken place I want you to read Jeremiah uh thoroughly as as thoroughly as you possibly can uh if you see anything that that you would have me to teach on in the in the in the books that I kind of jumped over uh just let me know and I will I will do my best to do that the word of the Lord the word that the Lord spake against Babylon and you know why I love this because America and Rome all together all the churches is spiritual Babylon and they have done exactly in the natural as well in the spiritual that the old Babylon done has done Bible said that Babylon was the cage of every unclean and hateful bird you understand what that means God has imprisoned them already locked in and and and brother Brandon preached a message Souls that are in prison now so they're there they're in their religion there the and and and Moab was what Moab was the son of lot and his daughter and they he was he was bought into this world by way of incest right and so he he came in more corrupt right as we heard our brother preach the other day that's why it had to be a virgin because amen there was a a a a certain standard that God was looking for and God couldn't use the woman nor could he use the man in such a way so God had to find a a woman that could house the god of the blood of God and and the seed of God Mary had nothing to do with it she was an incubator but we needed that uh type of uh virgin SE uh to be able to join with God and so is it now God called for virginy us being virgins to the word obedient to the word now we're not speaking natural now we're speaking spiritually and that word means that we're not going to get plac to the devil's lies and his deception and that's why God sent us a prophet see those who did not obey Jeremiah many of them died by the hand of the Babylonians right and you're going to find out in this 50th chapter if we can get through it that God destroys Babylon the word that the word that the Lord spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chans by Jeremiah the prophet declare ye y ye among the Nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say Babylon is taken Bale is confounded meido is broken in pieces her Idols are confounded Her Image are broken in pieces and you so what do you mean brother Brooks we understand that those demons out of the Euphrates am me went into Hollywood and Hollywood is a representation of what uh the the the demons and the power of Satan from where the anian world the Judgment of the Lord and we understand that these things these demons had come back uh once the the the the cap of as brother bam said the lid of hell was taken off and now we see the flooding of these demons to do what bring the world back into the state of judgment where God can do nothing but judge but understand the prophet of God says before God said judgment he always brings a warning you said why are you saying this don't you understand what I'm trying to say we didn't have Jeremiah but we had William Brandon we had we had a a Prophet by the you know under the inspiration of Elijah that God said that when he was done the world would burn so what are you looking for the point is we're living almost in the same kind of day people's hearts are hard you can preach all you want to and people still believe because they belong to this message they're going to have with no change in heart no change in lives no change at all they do what they want to do and come to church and feel like they all right that's exactly what Israel would do and God hated that kind of action let's go on I'm sorry for out of the North there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and None Shall dwell therein they shall they shall remove they shall depart both men and Beast now wait we know what we have heard been taught that in our day not only that does the ones from the north Russia is going to be on the soil China is on the soil and all of these things are happening because it is the Vengeance of God we have not reached the climax of all these things but God listen listen have your ears open as we continue to read and I I looked at the chapter 50 50 means Jubilee 50 means freedom and and God is saying to us amen we we can have this Freedom I'm giving you the warning I'm telling you the truth now what we going to do with it are we going to be like Babylon oh I'm a Jew we we're safe under the message no you're not you're not safe unless you're in the message and the message is in you no religion is safe that's not the shelter of God the shelter of God is under the blood of the Lamb of Jesus Christ that's the only shelter in those days in that time said the Lord the children of Israel shall come they and their children of Judah together coming and weeping they shall go and seek the Lord their God now if that ain't what's happening right now amen Israel is seeking the face of God they shall they shall ask the Way to Zion with their faes thither toward saying come and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant that shall NE not be forgotten so in all of this judgment God is still waking him up now you know and I know what Israel has suffered because of their rejection and they they rejected God because they were Wicked and and and filthy matter of fact John said you Generation of Vipers it had gotten so bad till it was like almost the same day of Jeremiah nothing but snakes majority of them were snakes and that's why they could say uh let let let let's blood be on us and our children see they couldn't see it they were blind blind yeah but this is the end of it there's not coming another generation this is this is it you know my people have been lost sheep their Shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from the mountain to heal they have forgotten their resting place and you see now people should should be here you know what's happening with them they're fighting demons every day all kinds of demons lust demons sexual demons you name it they're fighting but where are they where are the people and if you don't come to church you know what you're going to do to it you going to yield to those Spirits you come to church for faith for strength for connection with God so you'll know the next move and and what people don't understand they they they they hand the word like it's a newspaper and and you're not going to get anything but news that's it but the word comes to change us people Jeremiah is not sitting here for it to be a book of History Jesus Christ is same yesterday today forever we are the spiritual Israel and what God did to them God is going to do to us and is doing to us because of our Disobedience and our idolatry and a lot of people are idolators and don't even know it yeah some people worship their Church some people worship holidays all kind of stuff and you'll find out that we are the same same way we're doing the same thing many people have been lost sheep their Shepherds have caused them to go astray is that right preachers they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from mountains to heill they have forgotten their resting place all that found that found them have devoured them and their adversary says we offend them not because they have sinned against the Lord and habitations of Justice even the Lord the hope of their father remove out of the midst of Babylon and go forth out of the land of the Chans and be as the as a heo before the blocks and that's what God has always called for his people a total separation of unbelief amen this is what God is calling for now a total separation but it's so difficult for us like the brother said God is not God is interested in your soul now the message the word is for the soul we allow our Spirits if you can heal the soul the spirit will fall in line the flesh will fall in line but your objective is when when you disbelieve in your soul is like a a a how can I say it uh h a domino effect if you're not believing in your soul your spirit fall and so will your flesh I was telling somebody the other day well matter of fact today I said how is it that we can we we we want to be Pentecostal and then we don't even understand what that mean but I'm I'll say it like this when brother brandham came did you ever see brother brandham wrestled with a demon did you ever see him fight with one did you ever see him beg one no brother Brandon prayed the demon was gone right you talking about the apostolic way the apostolic way is when your Shadow will heal Lord the apostolic way is when the devil see you coming they're scared amen we cast Devils out just by our presence amen you see what I'm saying that's the real way now how far away are we from that we see what the Pentecostals come on out devil come on out you gotta come out that ain't that's not even scriptural Jesus spoke the word and those Devils had to obey not only that the apostolic way is what when the devil knows your name the sons of ska they didn't know the names of those they says who are you Paul we know y'all know what I'm saying but see they did the devil says we can't recognize you because you don't have what it takes and that is the true way of the Bride but if we don't turn loose the World we'll never get there everything must die as he said and rot it's not the word that's is ineffective is us we want to hold on on to our lustful thoughts and desires ninth verse but lo I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of a great nation from the North country and they shall set themselves in Array against her from then she shall be taken their arrows shall be as a mighty expert man and none shall return return in vain the Talan shall be a spoil all that spoil her shall be satisfied said the Lord because ye were glad because ye Rejoice oh ye destroyer of my Heritage you see what I'm saying God raised them up they rejoiced because they conquered Israel and and so will it be the same people who conquered or think they conquered the church the real Church the foolish virgins they themselves will be caught up and destroyed Babylon you know brother brandham said only Jesus Christ will be able to stop her it's so deep and ingrained in everybody it's so in people's DNA till they don't even see the difference systematic worship all of that came from Babylon raising men up higher than they should be that's Babylonian when when Jesus came and he found s Pharisees Sadducees scribes and aodan where did you think they got that from they got it from Babylon they brought all of that stuff and when they when Jesus came they were so mixed up they couldn't even recognize the word and so is it now it was so mixed up in Jeremiah's Day by different influences by false prophets that even Israel had until they could not recognize the voice of of God they thought they were in a season of blessings when they were in a season of cursing and that's where the church is today you're in a season of cursing you're in a season of repentance is that is that the word the Bible said according to uh uh Revelation Third chapter repent to the lay of SE Church AG repent be zous to repent you know let let be tried in the fire that you'll come out as pure gold but you know it it's it becomes a story to people they don't take it seriously anymore I mean we us should take this message really serious but that's what happens when you don't allow it to connect to your heart it fades it becomes boring and you and I must know by God's grace amen that once the word becomes boring you in Def you in trouble let move on I know I'm not going fast enough am am I I think I'm reading on the wrong side of the page teach oh Lord have mercy forgive me Jesus I'm in 51 that's where that's why you're looking I'm in 51 sorry about that I turned I turned the wrong page I apologize I've jumped so much you forgive me please yes I'm sorry let's stop at the fifth verse of 50 I am tired and forgive forgive me for that I'm I'm really really tired today so um I'm pressing by the grace of God I I had uh I let brother Alis out today and I had so many other things I need to do and didn't get a chance to do but forgive me let's go 50 and five please they shall ask of the way of Zion with their faces sther toward saying come and let us join ourselves to the Lord okay we did read that uhhuh my people have lost their sheep yep and the Shepherds hm we on the 11th verse okay of the okay good thank you brother because you were glad you call ye Rejoice oh yes you because you you were able to destroy my inheritance because ye are crowns fat are grown fat as the heer at the grass and Bellows or Bellows as Bulls your mother shall be sore confounded she that bear you shall be ashamed behold the hind the most uh of the nation shall be a Wilderness a dry land a desert because of the Wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited but it shall be wholly desolate everyone that goeth by Babylon shall be astonish and hiss at her plagues now I want to say this you know and I know that is the truth Israel was so desolate and so Barren for so many years nobody thought it could ever be inhabited gain but God had a prophecy that that Israel will return and he would restore like he said in Malachi for us God will restore so when Israel came back to their Homeland because of God punishing them and and spanking them and chising them by way of Hitler musan musan U musolini and and others amen they were driven back to the Homeland and and now we see them as a FL a nation but it ain't all over Jesus said when they come become as a nation you know that summer is nigh That season is nigh what what season the destruction the destruction and of the Gentile Nations and the rebuilding of Israel that's where we are we're at right at the crooks of this thing and and is about to happen and we see that if we don't get on the side of the Prophet believe what brother Ram believe the message of the hour receive the message of the looking for what the Messiah because if not that's the only safety there is an exodus and brother BR preached the Third Exodus this is what we're talking about there is an exodus Israel had an exodus and they were brought into Babylon but then they also had an exodus when they came out of Babylon into 70 years they were there right that was all God God did every one of of those things right but and you think they would have learned now if you take Israel right now you just got a little small group of people that's really Israel it's a small country but if you take Tel Aviv Tel Aviv is one of the most wickedest places on the face of the Earth it is absolutely the capital of homosexuality my wife and I were there in Israel they wouldn't even take us to Israel I mean Tel because it was so e evil that was years ago I can't even imagine what it's like now and what I'm trying to say is Tel Aviv is no no different than Los Angeles and all of these people all of these things going to be judged they are judged they they're ready for the Vengeance of God and what is the Vengeance of God today fire fire everybody want to push the button we're right in the face of it right put yourself in Array against Babylon around about all ye that be the bow and shoot of her spare no arrows for she have sinned against the Lord and what did God what did God do you you you so well brother what are you saying when the when the world especially that that particular country I won't call the name when they realized who is behind all of this evil we know that they will be bombed yeah God will rais up and has raised up a nation not only to bomb them but to bomb us too it will happen it must happen but thank God that the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone that's right everybody that followed the order of Jeremiah lived and everybody that didn't follow the order God didn't care what Jew they was what tribe they was where they came from how they how old they were they died there were those who tried to escape by going to Egypt and God raised up an enemy to go attack Egypt and they God killed them in Egypt see there's no hiding place other than in the pl in in in other than under the blood of Jesus Christ amen let's go on I'm sorry shout against her roundabout she have given her hand her foundation all Fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the Vengeance of the Lord take vengeance upon her as she have done do unto her is that right Book of Revelation said double the cup double her pay what she's done said said that that that the blood of all the martyrs is in her she's killed us she's destroyed us and God said because you done it I'm going to destroy you don't you understand that when the bride is gone and then then then after the the foolish virgin when she's uh dealt with what's left pure serpents and God destroy them all so that you'll know make sure you count it in the in the number 17th verse Israel I'm not gonna Israel is is is is a is a is a scattered sheep the Lions have driven from her from him away the king of Assyria have devoured him and and last this Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon have broken his bones therefore thus said the Lord of hosts the god of Israel behold I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I have punished the king of Assyria now God raised these uh these people up to chastise Israel and then God comes right back around and destroy the countries that did so they enjoyed it and you say well what do you mean just like the world thinking right now that the god of Israel is dead they think that God has forsaken Israel and they're thinking that God is their imag this God they have is their imagination and they don't realize they're repeating exactly what Babylon said about them about Israel God is forsaken you he you know he's he's no longer with you and stuff like that you see but what they failed to see was God said I will never leave you I will never forget you I have Graven you on on the palms of my hand and not only that God said all Israel will be saved and every true seed of Israel will be saved every true seed of the Bride will be saved amen that's that's it and I will bring bring Israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on the carel and Basham and his soul shall be satisfied upon Mount Ephraim and Gilead and in those days in that time say the Lord the iniquity of Israel should be sought for and there should be none and the sins of Judah and they shall be found for I have pardon them I reserved you see what I'm saying when is that H when will that happen right you say well brother Brooks this is way back then but I'm going to tell you the end of this thing is after the bride is gone they will receive their Revival amen God will pardon Judah and God will pardon Israel and God will fill them with the Holy Ghost one nation in one day amen and that's powerful right when all the world think that it's finished well because you you you see what they going to do right when they they kill Moses and Elijah they're going to Rejoice they're going to throw a party when they wipe out the Jews because the Jews said there'll never be another holy CA but we know that it will be cuz the Bible says so they're going to kill 144,000 and God is going to raise them up amen you see what I'm saying it's evident that they got to do another suffering people and you say well what do you mean it's all because of you God blinded them that he may graft Us in and that's why God said always pray for Israel and you think that God is going to let them suffer like that for people who don't even care about their salvation no this was bought with a great price a great price it was bought with the blood of Jesus Christ and it was also bought with the blood of Jews yeah go up against the land of of meidam even against and even against it and against the inhabitants of p PE peod waste and utterly destroy after them said the Lord and do accordingly to all that I have commanded thee a sound of battling battle is in the land and the great destruction how is the Hammer of the whole earth cut aunder and broken how is Babylon become a desolate among the nation I have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken oh Babylon and thou was not aware thou art found and also carried because thou has driven against the Lord striven against the Lord now I go home and say just like the word of God says here the devil is trying to kill every man and the secret was in the woman he hid the secret in the woman so that was so powerful to me and so is it today he he's trying to destroy these great churches and things of that nature but the secret is in the bride that's why the Rapture is a revelation to who the Bride of Jesus Christ nobody else know knows the way of escape the Lord have opened the Armory and have brought forth the weapons of his ignation for this is the work work of the Lord God of host is in the land of Chans now how many of y'all know who childan is H yeah it's it's it's the land of Babylon but you got to also know that Chans and China is mixed because that's where China was so you got to understand that Babylon and China and Rome I mean and and and and and uh uh what you call it when it says that Abraham came out of the land of Chala that land was actually Asian amen so even even even your your your your Abraham don't look like you think he look so the Lord has opened his Armory and have brought forth so that you understand what what what what we're trying to say everybody has turned against America everybody because of what we've done we have no friends we tried to buy friends and you say what do you why are you saying all of these things because the guns are pointed at us and you're going to realize one of these old days everything God did to the old Babylon he's going to do it to us because brother bam said I look to turn and all I saw was smoking Ash the Judgment of the Lord Malachi 4 5 and six when that judgment come it's going to be fire we're under the inspiration of judgment they call it they call it global warming and all that stuff inspiration of judgment polluted air polluted water polluted food polluted everything the Judgment of the Lord sound a battle we're in a battle sound a battle I have laid a snare the 24th verse I have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken oh Babylon and thou has thou was not aware th thou art found and also caught because thou HTH striven against the Lord the Lord ha opened his Armory and and you know brother brandham said it you can look it up China was the first civilization so you understand all of these nations they may have come under another name but they that what what is has already been and you and I I got to understand by the grace of God that God doesn't God waits till it gets so full you said well why would you say that he waited in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah can I find righteous anywhere none in the days of Noah eight everything had come to a full everybody was doing what they thought was right in their eyes and you got to understand Israel was the only one that had the laws of God and the laws of God was the not to restrict us or to curse us the laws of God was set there to give us a long life on Earth as long as you did God's laws you lived when when is when Israel met these countries they didn't have no law they didn't they didn't know who Jehovah was they had Devils they were worshiping and all of those Devils was what Devils of the flesh I mean they they they they sacrific babies what do you think they're doing now I mean it's the same Spirit but just in a worse way so much so it's the whole world and God got to destroy the whole world because we all corrupt so you understand that's why all Gentile Nations hate Israel because even in the Old Testament all Gentile Nations hated Israel and Moab was one that hated her the most who was a relative and so you can understand that's why the World Council of churches hate the bride amen because the World Council of churches represents Moab pod word and Par system hybrid but they hate the true seed of God which is you and and Israel you love the Lord hallelujah any questions yes he was from that land for my according to my understanding sir yes sir called together the arteries against Babylon all ye that bend the bow against it uh uh uh uh uh the bo Camp against it round about it none thereof Escape recompense her according to the work according to all that she haveth done do unto her for she have been proud against the Lord against the Holy One of Israel and and you see her in the in the old test I mean the New Testament she rides upon a beast with 10 horns and those 10 horns we see those 10 Nations which we call the United Nations those same 10 horns is living today that will go against her and their their whole duty is to wipe her off the face of the of the earth and even though they think that's what they're going to do God preserves them just like he preserves the bride Now who is the king of Babylon Satan himself so you understand I'm talking about L Lucifer the Beast the man who puts out the mark of the beast the system that that literally swallows the world up and all of them whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life 30th verse therefore shall her young men fall in the streets and all her Men of War shall be cut off in the day as say the Lord behold I am against against thee Oh thou that most proud say the Lord God of host for the day is come the time that I will visit thee and the most proud shall stum stumble and fall and None Shall raise him up and I will Kindle a fire in the cities and it shall be devoured all around about him can I can I throw I keep talking maybe too much but let me show you what God is doing just what he did he literally opened the gates for Babylon for Cyrus and and and to to come in and and and invade and and you say what do you mean it it you you what do you think the border is is a door open amen so that America can be invaded amen it's God's judgment because we turn our backs on God God has turned his back on us as a nation that's exactly what is happening and the next thing is destruction if there be a another great America I don't know I don't think this the season that it doesn't seem like that's what the music sheet is saying but I will say by the grace of God God has never left himself without a witness Hallelujah and God just like he made a way of Escape for those of old he makes a way of Escape for us we ought to be so happy and thrilled to know that the day we got instructions we see what God did yesterday is a warning that we may keep ourselves upright before God un L the same thing happened to these people will happen to us God has no respect of person that's how he is all right 32nd verse and most and the most proud shall be stumbled and fall and none shall rise up him raise him up and I will K the fire in the cities and it shall devour all round about him thus said the Lord uh of host the children of Israel the children of Judah were op pressed together and all that took them captive held them fast they refused to let them go their redeemer is strong the Lord of hosts is his hand uh right he shall thoroughly plead their case that he may give them rest to the land and disqui the inhabitants of Babylon so you got to understand even to this day look what they're doing they got they got Israel in touch such a tight hole she can't even defend her country who who you think is ruling that that's Babylon you know and and then you think the man behind the curtain don't know what's going on and then he's talking about going to the UN and and and and and and and and and telling them to bring peace as our brother was telling me today that's scripture and how will they bring about peace they have to make a covenant and if they make a covenant where those people are who's going to make the Covenant with them they're here amen just as sure as the bride is here they're here and we're going to see these people negotiating the world will know nothing about it but we will amen this is why it is really time we have to fight y'all know we're struggling and and the point is we got to know what season it is and say Lord you know I need more I need more desperation I need more sincerity I need you right now because I can see the Horsemen's I can see what's coming my way give me Grace to escape I believe the message that you sent to us right and so that's that's how to that like our brother rich brought out about Luke pray every day always that the Lord would count you worthy to escape the wrath that is to come all right so we got one more Sunday uh Friday in this month amen so I think I think uh no this this this yeah I got one more week yeah so we'll be able to have one more one more service on uh on Jeremiah for those I know some of youve been blessed I don't know about all of you but I've been told by some that you just blessed you and I thank God for that right 34th verse then redeemer is strong the Lord of hosts is his name he shall thoroughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land and disqui inhabitants of Babylon a sword is upon the Chans sayeth the Lord and upon the inhabitants of Babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men a a sword is upon the liars and they shall do do a word is upon her Mighty Men and they shall be dismayed a word excuse me a sword I'm sorry a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people of her and they shall become as women sword is upon her treasure and they shall be robbed now I don't know why you can't see it but I'll just say it like this they have feminized our m military so badly the men in Marine used to be a man army navy they were tough people now they have watered things down everybody's soft uh it's true and you know they're soft because they let women fight and it it just it's a curse and it's God said would happen they would become his men and women uh just soft like that and let me ask you a question physically how could we stand against people like China how how could we stand physically if we just went say drop the guns and let's just fight with our fist you know you you know almost Every Nation would whoop us we're not equipped anymore we don't do it you know you know I'm I'm I might get in trouble for saying these things but I'm going to say it anyway there was a time a army Personnel could not be fat and if you was overweight they would suspend you until you lost that weight before you could come back in policemen's come on how how they going to chase you I'm just saying we done let it down we we we you know it's sad it's really sad but they couldn't help the inspiration the inspiration of today is destruction everything that that that once was solid must be destroyed and from the food to the air to the ocean to the air everything is being destroyed slowly but surely like I was telling somebody today and I'm going to close in just a bit I know I'm a little bit beh overtime but let me say it like this if I has had weather like this before it must have been before I got here I have never seen so many tornado sir heard so many tornadoes sirines in such a short period of time and even where I live it was so close go go go to anky you see all branches and everything Brown down and broken I mean it it it amazes me because I've seen the change and all of this stuff is because of judgment you know we never thought H famine was God's judgment but it is all of these things when Nature changes God uses that to try to bring people back to repentance okay cuz I know you're tired let me hurry up all right what verse was I on brother 38 okay a drought is upon her Waters and they shall be dried up for it is the land of the graven images and they are mad upon their Idols therefore the world the the the wild beast of the desert with the wild beast of the islands shall dwell there and the ows shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited forever neither shall be it be dwelt in uh from generation to generation as God overthrew Sodom and gomorah and the neighbor City thereof said the Lord so shall no man abide there neither shall any son of man dwell therein Behold a people shall come from the north always from the north and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the coast of the earth they shall hold a bow and Lance and they are cruel and what did Brother randam say about uh Russia he said they are cruel he used that same word they are because they have no God you don't have a God you're cruel man's Nation n nature is evil and with not show Mercy neither voice shall roar their voice shall Roar like the sea and they shall rise upon horses e even I mean everyone put in Array like a man to the battle against the old Daughters of Babylon the king of kings of Babylon have heard the report of them and and His Hands waxed fil again uh uh excuse me and anguish took hold of him and pains as a woman in travail behold he shall come up like a lion from the s dwelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong but I will make them suddenly run away from her and who is a chosen man that I have made May appoint over her for who is like me and who shall will appoint me the time and who is the Shepherd that will stand before me therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord that he have taken against Babylon in his purposes that he have purposed against the land of the Chans surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their H habitation desolation with them and as the noise of uh and as the noise of taking of Babylon the Earth is moved at excuse me at the noise of taking of Babylon the Earth is moved and the cry is heard among the Nations sound like a fierce thing sound like a thing that's going to really rock reel and rock the Earth and you know and I know it that's exactly what it's going to do and and you look at these things you say well brother Brooks that that was for Jews but if you can't see and you can't hear God speaking to you through these scriptures then something's wrong something's wrong this is a serious time it it is a time of Consecration and and myself I today I was too busy too busy I don't like being busy like that uh um but I tell you what saints of God it is always a trick of the devil it's always a trick of the devil to make us so busy till we don't give God his time this is not a time to be that way this is a time of trying to meditate and and and and on the word and try to keep ourselves abiding in the word and you know and I know and I'm not saying oh I'm 100% where I should be but I will say this by God's grace I press every day I battle every day but I press every day and I'm going tell you as brother brandham said do the the best you can and God will take care of the rest let's stand father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your
