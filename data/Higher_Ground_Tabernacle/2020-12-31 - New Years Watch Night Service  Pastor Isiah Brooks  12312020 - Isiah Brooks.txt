lost but now [Music] [Music] again [Music] all right god bless you church um i think brother frank jones oh hey man i want to wish everybody happy new year you know we praise the lord for bringing us this far hey without taking too much time we can stand and read the bible we open our bibles in the book of proverbs we read the 22nd chapter and the first verse [Music] proverbs chapter 22 the first verse the bible says a good name is rather to be chosen than great reaches and loving favor rather than silver or gold repetition [Music] and uh let's let's go again to genesis 27 36 [Music] genesis chapter 27 verse 36 yeah chapter 27 verse 26 verse 36 my bad i'm sorry i'm sorry the bible says and he said he's not it's not he rightly named jacob for he has supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he has taken away my blessing and he said has thou not reserved a blessing for me yeah genesis 27 verse 36 [Music] thank you father god for giving us our father lord this good health mercedes of adolescent day thank you father god for giving us so follow this breath of life for now i want to approach to your word father god we pray that you'll be with us tonight i think if i can call it give it a subject or title it'll be a name change a name change so uh it doesn't mean that you know we have to change our name so you know no you know what it means that the bible every time most of the time when the bible uses the word names you know it more likely means character so basically a character changed a change of character it's about the character because you know it's a new year we're going to a new year you know you know new year doesn't mean you have to flip the page and forget about everything that happens because if you're not if there is no change the same you who was last year you will be the same you know the next coming year so if oh i forget what i just said uh if let's move on i'm sorry you know uh last year if if you did if there is no change it'll be the same year who was last year that would be the same view next year you know that's why i say you know a change of a name a name change because we know that every time that we in the bible you know names represented characters you see the bible is talking about you know lao laodicea but if you go you know studied the audition you will see that as the bible says you know it was uh neat it was uh neither neither cold nor or hot in nation you know one from the south and the other one from the north lands and the one from the south was bringing hot water and if you drink it you will vomit so meaning that you know as its name you know as the character is it comes and i also believe that when adam was naming animals no he didn't just name animals just by the sake of naming them in apaches donation he saw the character of each animals and then he gave a certain specific name to it you know it's so a lion was a little bit aggressive and he gave him a name life you know so it's so uh a lamb and then he gave him a lamb you know all that was the name it was attaching character to them and i believe here in this room that we most of us here do have bible's name or we have names that have good meanings if our character doesn't compare the oh it doesn't match up with the name that we do here only having a name doesn't mean anything that's a minority you know last time when i preached uh well we said that you know we read from the bible where we saw five women had to go to one man to ask that men to have you know they went to him and said give us just your name and don't we don't care about anything that we would do they just wanted a name but they didn't want to take the character that was coming with this name you know as the bible says you know everything that you ask in the name of jesus you know it doesn't mean that it's just the name jesus you know because there is a lot of people you know we have our brothers mexicans you know they're all named jesus because i want to pray mexican when he's talking about jesus he's basically talking about the character of jesus and my wish this year this coming year is that everybody you know if we can change our you know god god will really use us in the in the in a spreading of you know better than how we did yeah last year the more we go or the more years we spend and you know the more you know our spiritual will become or the more you know closer to god we become the more the prisons of our son the priesthood you know we read here in genesis 27 so i've only done genesis no it's basically talking about jacob you know you see that jacob was blessed by his father okay but still he had his name with him you know he said the name jacob means a subplaner you know a supplanter you know someone who would do everything in his power to get whatever he needs yeah can't keep it felt you know he can't wait now and then after he met the angel you know he saw that you know when his life was changed you know but but his name was not changed you know now you heard the new jacob same with the same old name that wasn't matching up some god has to give him a new name of israel you know but israel that that means the one who has fought with with the angel with god and he has overcome israel thank you you know as i say that we most of us most of us don't have bible's name by bible names for example you know my name is isaac for example if you say isaac means laughter laughter so which the way i understand it is like you know it's someone who it's really hard for him to get mad or to get frustrated [Music] you know name and character character is something very important the prophet says that a character is a victory you know a character is not a gift you know a character is a victory it's something that we have to fight for it's something that we have to you know it's not it's not freely gift you know it's something that you have to win it okay you have to fight for it it's when the lord is giving you trials and temptations you know because here sam uh solomon says that a good name is better than gold salomon you know a good character is better than all the riches of the world what benefit you will have when you have all the goals and you don't have a good or a good uh uh character or a good name you know by the second thing is that we who call ourselves christians that shows that you know who have the name of christ attached to us you know when we go out in the city you know when we go out to schools you know you know when we go when we go to work no we don't reflect the name of the character we don't reflect the character attached to the name christ you know it's hard for people to say that this one is a christian yeah which means that when people have to expect something that is greater than what in our life right now expectations the premier secretary you know but you know we have to change our character has to change you know and the only person who can do it is god you know the only person who can do it is god that's a person if you can only come to him this is a new year i don't want to just turn the page of the book but i wanna i wanna have a change i wanna experiment something you know a change in my life because we have an experiment you know you see that you had a bad habit you know you were stubborn or something jacob you know but you pray to god and say lord this new year i want to be a new person jesus look at me and say lord lord i want i want people you know those who knew me i don't want them to recognize me again anymore you know you used to come late to church you know you say lord i wanna you know i wanna change i wanna have a good character change my characters you know we have a lot of people in the bible you know that the names you know where where you know who reflected their lives you know he was a man he was a a very uh angry man a mad man 10 of his servants you know to go to him and and and to ask him i think he did something to david and they did david send his servant to go to him to go talk to him david 25 25. you know you will see that neighbor the the uh neighbor the the name of neighbor means adult or a vile person yeah so and that's how it works second circulating you know that's that's that's what is reflected my prayer this morning i made it tonight is that you know to pray to god to say lord lord i i don't want i you know i want to change but i want to i want to have a new walk with you via you know i want to have a new life you know oh my past lord i don't want to be that anymore i really want to change and i think the lord is really you know the lord is more more than welcome to change our lives the lord is more than welcome to change our characters you know because he said come come unto me you are weary you know you are thirsty come to me i'll give you free water you say come by gold with no price you know i he has the good things that we need the only thing that we can do is just go to him and express to him and tell him how we feel let's tell him the desire of our heart i know that the lord will will really do and the lord will change our lives i think my time is up god bless praise god amen character hallelujah amen i'm so glad our lord jesus he had he had the best character amen and uh the statue of a perfect man that's his character amen and that's what we desire to be amen let's sing a victory is mine [Music] then we'll have brother uh brother joyce amen special [Music] amen hallelujah [Music] [Music] victory [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] victory [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen brother joyce amen may be seated [Music] god bless you [Music] i truly believe is

faithfully [Music] is is [Music] hallelujah and then i think we have sister rose is she here no sorry it's just a hope sister hope here oh this is dope it's just a hope it's a dope amen hallelujah

changing him and yes [Music] will not [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] rapidly [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen is everybody holding amen amen amen i came to church a little tired tonight a little wary [Music] john chapter 15. we'll read from the 15th verse i appreciate what my brother isaac spoke about it from brother branham [Music] john chapter 15 verse 15 it says john peter seconds d henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord does but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you foreign because i have shown you everything that the father has given me back from me calling you my friend amen amen genesis chapter 21 read from the first verse sir and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken let's just stop right there [Music] isaiah [Music] and we i don't know if there's much better blessing than i can think of than that because that was not just spoken unto those that were going on before us took that word to each and every single one of us says upon the lamb's book of life just to be servants of the most high god but he sent a message in this lesson open [Music] come enemies surrounding us the enemy has come to your house he's been trying to get into your background you see don't you know what it is rattling the windows my god has given you an overcoming is amen you know when when god called abraham abraham was living there over in some other foreign land he didn't know what what all was going to transpire you didn't know what was getting ready to take place something just came across speaking to him and he found out that something was nothing other than the creator of the heaven keeps holding me and later on that creator said abraham is my friend abraham emmanuel no matter as the years going on and the years went on that abraham left all the things of the world behind he came and he was getting old but he is even though he's getting old he had a promise where god said i am giving you a son [Music] and as [Music] abraham says you know lord i'm getting old i'm getting old lord should we have you senior i don't see how you're gonna bring this promise to passion i just don't see how you're gonna do it lord as he saw the promises of god and the blessings of god come to pass all over again a little prayer and god answers it without you even expecting it oh my god it's blessed something i didn't even deserve god do so many things for him in his life here is still that one process yet it could have been called just one promise yeah lord i'm going back into your promised land jordan one more time or chapter 21 it says um and the lord visited the bride and the lord visited sarah pride did god visit the bride [Music] the lord did underserved the lord dead unto the bride says he had spoken do you know where we're standing saints do you know where we are standing up where are we at uh you say oh it's been so many years so now i want you to know maybe we get the 70 in our bodies it's like oh yeah but abraham was 100. but let me tell you even though abraham was a hundred years old he had a faith that was living inside of him and their faith is it kept holding on to him and it drove him to go back to jehovah once more you know i got some promises saints i'm waiting on fulfill being fulfilled i gotta be perfected i gotta i gotta keep checking up by myself i have a character i'm going to um i have a rapture there's there's promises that have been given there's a promise that's been given she won't be doubting amen she won't be doubting and she has the faith that abraham had foreign [Music] oh there be people follow uh [Music] to show her the way is going back to the promises why for the fulfillment of the last promise of the rapture for the bride [Music] just let your feet let loose from gravity just now must still awaiting that one isaiah chapter 40. verse 29 it says he giveth power to the faith oh to them that have no strength to them that have no might is is even they wait upon them abraham was old abraham oh he was 100 years old but he was just waiting upon them he was just waiting upon them absolutely absolutely will happen absolutely [Music] when the bible says shall lost it's a prophecy it cannot fail abraham had a [Music] the bible they shall man up with wings as eagles [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] him i said don't you worry don't you fear no need to put his enemy to sleep he drew uh according to me to his enemy and cut off a little bit part of his coat there's a little symbol symbol that god had gave him to the victory one day jonah was in the belly of a whale exactly what god taught [Music] she began to renew her strength amen i just want to read one quote here as i asian you're ready to turn over to brother isaiah [Music] what did the prophet see is it a prophecy she's in her infancy sir oh we've heard about the holy ghost for so long our and just like abraham stood there and waited [Music] until she got the genesis 21. just [Music] she's [Music] and she took the victory that's the power of god is your victory power is the holy ghost it is your promised land abraham had to go back from guerrero to the promised land wait upon the lord will renew their strengths and they'll set their wings like an eagle oh they won't just fly over the treetops amen by a heavenly and lord by that permission [Music] [Music] even the young men will get weary wore out [Music] [Music] amen [Music] what a wonderful time amen brother branham said if he had a choice of the age in which he would could live in a village he said it would be this stage and you know he was looking at something and i'm trusting by the end of the night that all of us can see what he was looking at the messages that have gone forth has been tremendous to me oh brother isaac dealt with the name change phrase and he basically said that the name change in itself was character and then our brother troy said spoke the message on god calling us his friend and when you are a friend of god he reveals his secrets to you yes and none of them knew or have seen my notes [Music] but they were writing my message marching to jerusalem we are marching to jerusalem [Music] oh oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] basically let me know so we won't go beyond gold we want to new years by god's grace we're going to be coming from romans 11th chapter zelon i love the word of the lord did you amen and when it comes it does something for me our brother sang that song something keeps holding me yeah not afraid so [Music] amen i was looking at our brother danny's uh young daughter she uh laughed when she was younger she looked just like him [Music] he's losing the battle now [Music] switching over man don't worry about it i had that happen to me too but nevertheless amen we enjoyed the the song they sang and yesterday let's go head on with uh romans 11 beginning at the 33rd verse 36 oh the death of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who have known the mind of the lord or who have been his counselor or who have first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen is and then we'll let you be seated efficient for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the debt and the height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god and know and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god [Music] at the end of this year 2020. god that you would do something special for us you're trying to show the species so that when this year 2021 comes in okay we will leave behind every failure to choose every disappointment hallelujah amen amen you may be seated i got a few minutes and it's going to be record-breaking we like to entitle this message moving into the depth of his love andre da la profunde de sonamos and for sub topic unexplainable one of the quotes that uh our brother troy uh mentioned [Music] he dealt with the infant bride falling but we know by god's grace it goes beyond that i was talking to one of my sons today and he said unto me it is very difficult for most men the people to receive something that is free or and we were talking about salvation you would be surprised at the number of people in this message [Music] grace is the unmerited love of favor [Music] it is something that god chose to do for you second question and oftentimes we first frustrate a test of ourselves the grace of god by trying to help god do it but we must understand that grace is free i don't know about you but i take mine i'll receive mine because i know that it's the only way that i can be saved is that which is revealed to you personally is that thing that god gives you that no man can take away hallelujah amen brother branham prays in what heareth thou elijah 1959 he said lord may our hearts be open tonight and let the holy spirit get you listen just speak into us your new power the things that he would have us to know that we might know god okay fear god for thou knoweth our frail frame for thou knoweth our frail frame and our make-up we would ask that you would forgive every sin that we have dead trust with thirst to be like the church of the living god they translated granted lord accord speak to us now as we wait further because it fits right into what i want to say tonight okay it is about character it is about god and it is also about knowing that god is your friend and not your and one thing i know about the changes that's about to [Music] is going to make a change occur in you whether you like it or not hallelujah you're going to either get closer to god or you're going to give him up who's what was that somebody help me tonight they didn't want to swear because we must realize this is a depth of god that god has predestinated us too [Music] that god will not pull you through a tube [Music] that we don't have to make a lot of noise it's all right if you make it because i like noise hallelujah but i understand sometimes people get the wrong interpretation resolving but the bible tells me that when they asked jesus how to pray hallelujah one of the things that gets me let that will be done in earth [Music] oh hallelujah maybe some of y'all don't understand he said i've had those feelings after i've come out of a meeting application wonders if you visit the scene at the beginning and sit in a car on the outside a meme ladder and hear them cry say hey legion do you say that wasn't nothing but psychology there is nothing then i crawled under that juniper tree hello [Music] but we all hit those experiences come on somebody amen we all go through those times but the mercies of jehovah man the mercies of jehovah and he knows his servants knees so he just put him to sleep and while he's laying there waiting to recuperate i'll turn down the city he said i've been back in a cave long enough and you have to see to know that there has been a lot of earthquakes shaking what is it s-t-e-w-s stews and big meetings uh shows but where has been god out of it now listen to them with you he said i've seen it all i've seen god heal jesus where he asked the question but where has god been i'll always get you out of it there's got to come something deeper than a healing service god becomes something deeper than a gift to speak with tongues the wind went forth but god wasn't in it we've had rushing mighty winds all over the country and sensations blood in the face [Applause] you know what one thing i love about brother branham he never compared himself in a sense he never went out to compare revivals with them in all the great fuss to say shows all the great arguments america is guilty of listening to those noises but god is not in the knowledge hallelujah amen don't you see what god is doing never he would pass against he's trying to get us to focus full of confusion as they are god and great [Music] trying to get something over to us at this point has not yet been opened [Music] when you see so-called christians today people that goes to church and live their dignified lives and go out and deny healing he is for books i believe you call it scaffold work let's say framework again all right it's a bonus it's a bogus it's a fake it's this one it's a frame y'all get what i'm saying except for one person see all of the things that we're doing two seconds oh god more of it yeah [Music] we didn't small voice that's something that puts the cream in the life hallelujah that's something that though you speak with tongues of men and of the angels memphis and have not exactly you are nothing that's right see we're beyond the church ages it was something god said there yeah it was lots of framework to peel something up because three questions y'all better hear what i'm saying i'm quoting the prophet that's paul said i'm pressing into that simple question hallelujah what else can god do for you guess get your pen he's already justified hallelujah amen amen and those who he said those whom he justified he's already glorified hallelujah none of us should sit here with sad faces put on the bride hallelujah why because she's freezing is that you and i must understand hallelujah he said there's one more thing left now yeah yeah i want you to understand the shows there i would not even be in iowa i had not heard that small steel voice season of and i don't mean no harm but i didn't even know that there were black people in iowa iowa i'm telling you the truth and for a while my wife and i when we first got here we were looking and didn't see nothing hey [Music] okay okay hallelujah yeah man y'all understand what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is sick as you said i was born in south south carolina and now i'm in iowa hallelujah what got me here was predestination oh somebody helped me here to conquer this and god hey take me to a cave where i can find it you know what brother says he said i don't care take me to a cave i mean if i gotta get in a cave something that puts the cream in the light yeah that's something yeah so you speak with tons of men and of angels you're nothing my question is when has when how long it's been how long has it been since god spoke to you the quickest dreams about it not from the head but from your heart the country of zappos here you said i've never heard his voice dude you better get up and go somewhere hallelujah is because they're dead because they speak in tongues god is with them but brother branham said something different david hart had david had all the pentecostal signs see going the church is not good enough generally saying that you belong to this message is not good enough this is not a time to pay attention when the corona came out oh god all of us were scared i said all of us preaching and all um you get the corona [Music] excited to get that that vaccine from exceeded felt like a preacher [Applause] god is the creator outside if i'm going to worship anything it's going to be the god who christ hallelujah glory to god what are you hallelujah is that all right is that correct oh god help me here get you amen he said though you can prophesy and speak with tongues and wonders for their seniors miracles and do great signs but give that little still small voice message is it in there see you in one of your favorites says the scripture secret [Music] [Music] god is a god of fellowship [Music] [Music] he would compare his spirit like a dog compare this spirit like a dog is this okay give me a few more minutes i'm watching the time it's a great thing see like grandchildren i'll acquire things it's great things sit in god's shoes oh excuse me it's great things are quiet things say grand shoes uh it shows calm did you know that friends say the sun which gives life on the earth every living thing in botany life plant life he don't like it that's it free life whatever more it brings forth life y'all understand what i'm trying to say i don't know whether they are awake or they're sleeping with their eyes hallelujah well he's not calling us to sleep he says [Music] y'all love the lord amen listen let me go on he said did you ever hear the world turning aveda did you ever hear the planet as as it passed through the orbits do you ever hear one i'm not talking about loving god with your mind i'm talking about me loving god with your heart so i'm gonna jump here now you and i we get tired of fatigue and the problem god said he has preached to so many tired people hallelujah he comes after you because he's trying to take everything out of you that god has put it into him hallelujah amen now true i didn't know i was going to read the scripture what are we hearing the quality fatigue like i said come to lady this is not a time to be listening to all those voices y'all understand me you know why brother branham talks about this so basically feminine

home some of y'all don't know what i'm talking about [Music] [Music] she's struggling with some things but you know i told her brother said tell her to open her eyes i told him i thought you was trying to get a good napkin or something but god is good to us that you won't heal them and i love you people i love all of you i trust you love [Music] [Music] but it's true in here right and i can take you to the mirror because i'm known you know i thank god for everybody you know i wish i had the kind of [Music] you know the thing about it is we share musicians on the musician yeah you understand what i'm saying we share with you so we are all part of each other and so i i say that by god's israelis when it boiled down to it so i nobody get offended i don't want anybody to just find
