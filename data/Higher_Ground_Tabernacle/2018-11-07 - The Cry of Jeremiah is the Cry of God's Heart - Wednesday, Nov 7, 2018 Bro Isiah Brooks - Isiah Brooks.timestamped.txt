[20:38] not prolonging the time we're just gonna
[20:40] get right into the Word of God God is so
[20:43] good to us
[20:46] hallelujah he's worthy to be praised how
[20:52] great is our God if we could just only
[20:55] remember that all the time
[20:58] amen it's a wonderful song to hold on
[21:00] your heart because God is great and
[21:05] greatly to be praised amen
[21:09] Psalm 17 please thank you brother
[21:15] hallelujah
[21:34] Psalm 17 we read the 8th verse then we
[21:44] go to Psalms 19 and 7 Psalms 17 and 8
[21:49] and in Psalms 19 and 7 and we don't
[22:00] declare his name who will I am so
[22:04] grateful that God has appointed and
[22:09] anointed me by God's grace to proclaim
[22:16] the truth in this day and hour
[22:20] somebody's got to do it 17 and 8 oh he
[22:27] says keep me as the apple of the eye
[22:31] hide me under the shadow of thy wings
[22:37] Psalms 19 we need to prayed these kinds
[22:42] of prayers because people of God if God
[22:46] don't have mercy on people like the
[22:49] scripture says if he doesn't shorten a
[22:52] time no flesh will be saying Psalms 19
[22:57] and 7 the law of the Lord is perfect
[23:03] concerning our converting the soul the
[23:06] testimony of the Lord is sure making
[23:09] wise the simple the statue
[23:15] the Lord are right rejoicing the heart
[23:20] the commandment of the Lord is pure
[23:23] enlightening the eyes the fear of the
[23:26] Lord is clean enduring forever the
[23:31] judgment of the Lord are true and
[23:33] righteous altogether more to be desired
[23:38] are they than gold yay then much fine
[23:43] gold sweeter also than the honey and the
[23:47] co honeycomb moreover by them is thy
[23:51] servant worn and it's in keeping of them
[23:55] there is great reward appreciate the
[24:01] Lord and His grace amen what what will
[24:05] we do without him thinking about how he
[24:09] has given us so much grace you know we
[24:16] we can only say even to this day is
[24:19] still amazing on what God has done for
[24:22] us and he is doing for us let us pray
[24:26] father we come before your Lord Jesus as
[24:30] humble as we know how and we thank you
[24:32] for your amazing grace we thank you for
[24:35] being so good to us
[24:37] you have been better to us than we have
[24:39] been to ourselves cleanse us from all
[24:42] unrighteousness help us now Lord Jesus
[24:45] that will be what you would have us to
[24:47] be in these last and evil days in Jesus
[24:50] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[24:54] seated by God's grace I have been just
[25:00] reading a lot in Jeremiah has just been
[25:05] so amazed at that particular book and
[25:09] Jeremiah just enlightened us on how
[25:14] Israel was and it's amazed
[25:19] because history always repeats itself
[25:24] we as Christians sometimes fail to see
[25:29] that what God is doing in our days and
[25:34] songs of Solomon Solomon said there is
[25:37] no new thing under the Sun Ecclesiastes
[25:42] and all tells us that the greatest
[25:45] wisdom that a man can have is to fear
[25:49] God and keep his Commandments we thank
[25:53] God for his knowledge and understanding
[25:57] we often time talk about the
[26:01] intellectual way of looking at things
[26:04] and we don't need just knowledge as a
[26:09] man would teach but we need the
[26:12] knowledge that only God can reveal see
[26:17] because a man could teach you about
[26:19] being born again even God taught Jesus
[26:23] and Nicodemus I mean Jesus taught
[26:26] Nicodemus and told him you must be born
[26:29] again
[26:30] and he told him you must be born of the
[26:32] water and of the spirit but that was
[26:35] knowledge I was understanding to the man
[26:37] who could understand it and even Jesus
[26:40] said Nicodemus no it's not like you go
[26:42] back into your mother's womb but that
[26:47] which is born of flesh is flesh and that
[26:49] which is born of spirit I like to
[26:52] entitle my message tonight the cry of
[26:55] Jeremiah is the cry of God's heart often
[27:02] time we don't understand preaching we
[27:06] hear people preach but we don't
[27:07] understand what that is God is a spirit
[27:10] and they that worship God and must
[27:13] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[27:15] the Bible tells us that no man have seen
[27:18] God at any time except the Sun and to
[27:21] whom he reveals you and I must
[27:24] understand that God chose preaching as
[27:26] foolishness it's foolishness of
[27:28] preaching is where God unveils himself
[27:33] often time people don't understand that
[27:35] preaching is just not a man with an
[27:38] occupation but it is a calling it is a
[27:41] divine calling of God where he stands in
[27:46] representative of the invisible God the
[27:49] God that cannot be seen and sometimes
[27:52] people take those things lightly because
[27:55] they see a man and they don't see God
[27:57] but those who are spiritual they can see
[28:02] God when other people see a man take for
[28:06] example the woman who Sarah decent woman
[28:10] when she saw Elijah she watched his
[28:15] mannerism she watched his character and
[28:18] to someone else he was just a man but to
[28:22] her she was more than a man because the
[28:26] knowledge of God was revealed to her
[28:28] that this man is special he is a god man
[28:32] and she even asked her husband to build
[28:36] a room because this man has God walking
[28:42] in and with him and because a man she
[28:46] was the revelation came to her she was
[28:50] rewarded a with that revelation she was
[28:55] rewarded so you got to understand God
[28:58] can do so many great things in such a
[29:01] simple way that if the people are not
[29:03] careful in a path right through them and
[29:06] they won't even know it when we come to
[29:10] God we must understand that God has
[29:15] feelings he's a man yet he's God he's
[29:19] God and yet he's a man because God made
[29:23] himself a man he once was a spirit only
[29:28] but now he is a man he men and the Bible
[29:33] tells us that the fullness of the
[29:35] Godhead bodily drew out in him now I
[29:38] understand that when God began to talk
[29:41] with his people see God had already
[29:43] talked with Adam and Eve in the Garden
[29:46] of Eden
[29:47] told him the things they should do and
[29:48] what they shouldn't do but at that time
[29:51] we realize a man that our God had the
[29:56] only voice but then here comes the
[29:58] serpent and he had a voice and his voice
[30:03] is the thing that caused discrepancy his
[30:05] voice is the thing that caused confusion
[30:07] his voice is the thing that caused death
[30:10] as long as they listen to the voice of
[30:13] God they lived as long as you listen to
[30:17] the voice of God you will live but it
[30:22] seems like man has a way or a tendency
[30:25] of trying to establish their own
[30:27] salvation we have a tendency to do that
[30:30] because even after Adam and Eve failed
[30:32] they tried to you know produce their own
[30:36] religion what we call the fig leaf
[30:38] religion and it didn't work with God
[30:40] that was their intelligence I'll put it
[30:43] this way
[30:43] it was the Serpent's intelligence
[30:45] because it was a serpent who told them
[30:47] that they were naked amen so being naked
[30:51] they tried to clothe themselves with
[30:53] their own knowledge but that knowledge
[30:56] was fallen now there was a time that I
[30:58] had a new got what God would required
[31:00] but because of the fall and the breach
[31:02] he didn't know so he didn't look
[31:04] guessing and got a fig leaf and covered
[31:06] himself and God told him that won't work
[31:09] so we find out by God's grace that God
[31:12] continues and God supplied them with
[31:14] lamb skin and covered their bodies and
[31:17] everything else and you know how the
[31:18] story is men began to multiply and a
[31:20] small man began to multiply so did
[31:23] unbelief and unbelief is sin right so
[31:27] they move out of the presence of God now
[31:30] watch this now because God gives Cain
[31:32] the knowledge he gives them instructions
[31:36] to do but it wasn't quickened to him see
[31:38] knowledge or let's put it this way
[31:40] God has to quicken his word to you in
[31:44] order for you to understand what he's
[31:46] saying because he said my word is spirit
[31:49] it is truth it is life and so when God
[31:53] can say one thing and and people can get
[31:57] all kinds of revelations from it but
[32:00] when
[32:00] God gives a revelation of what he's
[32:02] saying to the believer because the
[32:05] believer will hear it the believer will
[32:08] see it they will understand it and then
[32:10] they will follow through with it
[32:12] amen because remember God gave to Ava
[32:14] the revelation of the sacrifice he had
[32:17] no book to read that was nothing he
[32:21] could read but God even if his parents
[32:23] told him the truth don't you understand
[32:25] if you got Christians Christian parents
[32:28] that don't mean you understand what
[32:30] they're talking about
[32:30] it takes a personal revelation from God
[32:33] for you to understand what it is to be
[32:35] born again when it comes to crying out I
[32:39] looked it up and a lot of you know we
[32:41] looked at the scriptures because Isaiah
[32:43] 58 and one says cry aloud and spare not
[32:46] lift up that voice like a trumpet and
[32:49] show that people their transgressions
[32:52] and the house of Jacob their sins now
[32:55] when we talk about crying out loud you
[32:58] and I must understand that Isaiah was a
[33:00] prophet and the word of the Lord comes
[33:03] by way of the Prophet in other words God
[33:07] takes a man who has been designed to
[33:11] hear his voice and echo out what he's
[33:14] saying right so crying loud it wasn't
[33:18] just shouting it was feelings in there
[33:23] there was emotions in there it means
[33:27] they meant that when God cries out
[33:29] there's a lamentation of some sort going
[33:32] on there's grief in that voice there's
[33:34] suffering in that voice right and
[33:37] sometimes those prophets would even cry
[33:40] because they could feel the pain of God
[33:44] when it came to his people you see a lot
[33:47] of times people think that they could
[33:49] just do whatever they want to and it's
[33:51] not affecting God that's for an example
[33:54] if you had children and your children
[33:56] would do something to go wayward him and
[33:58] you feel the pain so is it with God when
[34:01] every one of his children go away with
[34:03] he feared the pain because he knows that
[34:07] that way is the wrong way and he knows
[34:10] that destruction is at the end of that
[34:13] day
[34:14] so when you see a preacher when he gets
[34:17] so emotional
[34:18] sometimes he screams sometimes he he
[34:20] looked like he's angry he's not
[34:22] expressing his feelings he's expressing
[34:25] God's feelings he's crying out trying to
[34:30] get the people to hear the voice of God
[34:34] so when God told Isaiah cry aloud and
[34:39] spare not in other words I don't want
[34:41] you to implement or put your own
[34:43] feelings into it
[34:45] I want you to just cry out like I feel
[34:48] what I feel
[34:49] unite with me now because I want these
[34:51] people to see how much I care and how
[34:54] much I love them that's why I cry oh God
[34:58] keep me as the apple of your eye
[35:01] lord please by your grace of God
[35:04] preserve me I want to be a real
[35:07] Christian a true Christian I want to be
[35:09] order and obedience son how long with
[35:13] God continue to cry understand there is
[35:17] a period in which God will cry God will
[35:20] beg you almost God will plead with you
[35:23] is that right the Bible says even the
[35:25] New Testament compel them to come do
[35:29] whatever you can do to come to make them
[35:32] come to this gospel why because God
[35:35] knows that there's only one life and
[35:37] that's his life right amen
[35:42] so we realize by God's grace amen
[35:46] there's coming a time when the preaching
[35:51] stops when God no longer cry out when
[35:57] God comes to the place he's finished
[35:59] dealing with you we call that crossing
[36:03] the line and that day at the North had
[36:07] preached 120 years to people all those
[36:09] people and you know God deals with you
[36:12] one by one if there were two to millions
[36:14] of million people in that day God went
[36:17] to each each individual pleading begging
[36:21] a hundred and twenty years of suffering
[36:24] God God did not want to sin
[36:28] the Bible said it repented him because
[36:31] he saw what man had become without the
[36:35] wild the preaching stops and when the
[36:40] preaching stopped if you haven't
[36:42] repented you shut out there's a time
[36:46] jeremiah cried out to the people God
[36:48] told him says listen they're in bad
[36:50] shape
[36:51] you're not going to get one convert out
[36:54] of this I want you to preach it like
[36:56] everybody can hear it everybody can come
[36:59] but know this truth Jeremiah they are so
[37:02] hard in their heart against me even so
[37:06] God says what have I done what is it
[37:09] that I've done have I not kept my word
[37:11] with you have I not taken care of you
[37:13] have a not been a friend have I not been
[37:16] a deliverer have I not been your Savior
[37:19] I've been everything you want me to do
[37:22] now why do you find fault in me that was
[37:25] the way God was crying out out the wild
[37:30] the voice of the Prophet ceases and God
[37:35] moves on because God said I'll never
[37:38] leave myself without a witness in the
[37:43] message divine healing brother Branham
[37:45] tells us he that sin willfully after
[37:48] receiving the knowledge of the truth
[37:50] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[37:53] saying Hebrews K and I believe he said
[37:56] is that right he said that sin willfully
[37:59] after receiving the knowledge of the
[38:01] truth there remaineth no more sacrifice
[38:03] for sins but a fearful looking for the
[38:06] fire to the judgment and firing England
[38:10] a ssin which shall devour the
[38:12] adversaries now he that he that what
[38:16] willfully is he that sins and what is
[38:19] sin unbelief he that will turn his back
[38:23] on the truth when it's presented to him
[38:26] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[38:29] sin did you ever read it that see like
[38:32] that he that disbelieved wilfully out
[38:35] the truth has been presented to him
[38:38] because his church believes different
[38:40] that's when you cry
[38:42] the line he that sin willfully after he
[38:45] has received the knowledge of the truth
[38:47] there remaineth normal sacrifice a lot
[38:51] of people don't know that they hear the
[38:53] message and they said oh but brother
[38:55] Branham you know he ain't the only one
[38:58] they have all kinds of excuses Amen to
[39:02] do the sin they won't to do and they
[39:04] know that what's being said is right but
[39:07] they choose to do something else you
[39:11] know if people understood that in the
[39:16] light that it really is in it would
[39:18] bring a godly fear upon them jeremiah
[39:24] i'ma show him I read a script when
[39:25] Jeremiah how it really was you see
[39:29] because Jeremiah the people out the wild
[39:31] start crying out to God and God wouldn't
[39:33] hear them oh my god you don't want to be
[39:38] in a condition that you decide to repent
[39:41] too late the days of Noah they repented
[39:47] too late you don't want to be there
[39:52] because God will not hear you
[39:58] Jeremiah mridu 14 17 for 12 Oh Lord
[40:03] though our iniquities testify against us
[40:07] do the whole it for thy name's sake for
[40:12] our backslidings are many we have sinned
[40:16] against thee o the hope of Israel the
[40:20] savior thereof in time of trouble why
[40:23] shouldn't I be as a stranger in the land
[40:25] and as a welfare man that turned it
[40:28] aside to tarry for a night why should it
[40:31] not be as a man as strong as a mighty
[40:34] man that cannot say yet now O Lord are
[40:36] in the midst of us and we are called by
[40:38] thy name leave us not see they crying
[40:41] out to God thus said the Lord until his
[40:44] people and that's the way it is we treat
[40:47] God like a stranger coming in for a
[40:48] night anytime you want a blessing from
[40:51] God you'll cry out to God for that time
[40:53] but then once God give you the blessed
[40:55] you go on to do what you want to do you
[40:58] treat him like he's some kind of
[40:59] senticles gift and then we fail to see
[41:02] that God has feelings thus said the Lord
[41:07] unto his people that's how they love to
[41:10] wander
[41:11] they have not refrained their feet
[41:13] therefore the Lord does not accept them
[41:16] he will now remember their iniquities
[41:20] and visit their sins then said the Lord
[41:23] are to be prey not for this people for
[41:25] their good when they fast I will not
[41:29] hear their cry and when they offer burnt
[41:32] offering and an ablation I will not
[41:35] accept them but I will consume them by
[41:39] the sword and by the famine and by the
[41:41] pestilence that's jeremiah 14 14 seven
[41:44] through 12 he says listen I'm not I'm
[41:48] not going to just listen to them anymore
[41:51] I pleaded with him I called to them I
[41:54] preachers behind I said the
[41:56] fivefold by you know that's what I'm
[41:58] telling you I'm telling you God is
[42:00] speaking to message people because they
[42:03] have taken on the same attitude that the
[42:05] people did in Jeremiah's day brother BAM
[42:09] said this message did not come to shake
[42:11] the world it came to shake the church
[42:17] this message did not come to shake the
[42:20] world it came to shake the church God
[42:26] has feelings the Bible tells us
[42:31] John I'm coming as a man even goes on
[42:33] and said Jesus wept and that's all look
[42:36] how he must have loved but they fail to
[42:41] see there was more to it
[42:47] one thing about God he knows unbelief
[42:51] and the atmosphere was full of unbelief
[42:59] when a preachers preaching and he's
[43:02] connected with God he can seal unbelief
[43:06] no matter how much he's preaching how
[43:08] much truth he's preaching he still knows
[43:11] the spirit of unbelief when there is no
[43:16] up when there's unbelief even the Word
[43:18] of God bounces off the people but when
[43:21] there's faith they become like a sponge
[43:27] then said the Jews behold how he loved
[43:30] him and some of them said could not this
[43:33] man which opened the eyes of the blind
[43:36] have caused that even this man should
[43:39] not have died Jesus therefore again
[43:44] groaning in himself coming to the grave
[43:47] it was a cave and a stone laid upon it
[43:50] and jesus said take away the stone
[43:53] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[43:56] said unto Him Lord by this time he's
[43:59] stinking but he has been dead for days
[44:02] and jesus said unto her said I not unto
[44:05] thee you understand me here God in flesh
[44:09] they had seen all kinds of miracles and
[44:12] even at that moment she doubted Lord
[44:18] this man has been dead you instructing
[44:22] God as if he didn't know sometimes we do
[44:26] that we go back at God and still God
[44:29] don't know your situation God knows when
[44:31] it began God's gonna know he knows when
[44:33] it's ending he knows the in-betweens and
[44:37] we talk to God like he don't even know
[44:39] what's going on that's exactly what Mary
[44:41] and then we'll do it take
[44:45] away the stole Martha the sister him
[44:47] that was dead said unto Him Lord die
[44:49] this time he's thinking for he had been
[44:52] dead for four days as if he didn't know
[44:54] Martha did Jesus said in her said I not
[44:58] unto thee in other word did not I tell
[44:59] you don't question my authority just do
[45:05] it don't question my word just do it
[45:09] said I not unto thee that if thou would
[45:13] have believed thou should have see the
[45:16] glory of God then they took away the
[45:19] stone from the place two women that huge
[45:23] stone how did they do it God had to take
[45:27] the same faith that he raised Lazarus
[45:30] with and he gave it to them because two
[45:33] women could not have moved that stone it
[45:36] was a huge stone it was a heavy stone
[45:41] take the stone away then they took away
[45:45] the stone from the place where he did
[45:47] the Dead was laid and Jesus lifted up
[45:50] his eyes and said father I thank thee
[45:52] that thou has heard me and I knew that
[45:55] thou here with me always but because of
[45:57] the people which stand by I said it that
[46:00] they might believe that thou has sitting
[46:02] me and we had thus has spoken he cried
[46:05] with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and
[46:11] he that was dead came forth bound hand
[46:14] and foot with grave clothes and his face
[46:18] was bound about with the napkin jesus
[46:20] said unto them loose him and let him go
[46:23] you hear what I'm saying he's dealing
[46:26] with the atmosphere charged with
[46:29] unbelief
[46:31] even Mary and Martha full of unbelief
[46:37] Lord this situation I've been here for a
[46:43] long time God don't care about your
[46:46] situation like that God wants you to
[46:48] know that he can change it God wants you
[46:52] to know he can fix it I always tell
[46:55] people that say understand it breaks God
[46:58] heart
[46:58] I could say like this when he find his
[47:01] own disbelieving him he even went
[47:06] Peterman was on the boat and they crying
[47:09] out Lord karat doubt not that we perish
[47:12] don't you understand he's your father
[47:14] he's your friend he's your daddy and
[47:16] when you we question God or whether he
[47:18] cares or not oh Jesus the cry of
[47:26] Jeremiah was to cry of God's heart I
[47:30] don't know exactly how many he is
[47:32] Jeremiah preached but all that he could
[47:35] tell them was this if you don't repent
[47:37] the Babylonians coming God is already
[47:41] raised up of people because you wouldn't
[47:44] repent the next thing you got is my
[47:46] judgment and it doesn't matter the
[47:50] people in this message even though they
[47:52] said when we got Amen like they did in
[47:54] Jesus day Abraham is our Father he said
[47:57] but if you had known Abraham you would
[48:00] have known me my thought you would have
[48:02] done the things that Abraham told you to
[48:05] do and then we say we believe this
[48:09] message Amen there was preached by the
[48:11] Prophet William Branham we will do what
[48:13] he said see because it's not the voice a
[48:18] William Branham it's the voice of God
[48:22] flowing through William Branham Jeremiah
[48:27] God had to really give him confidence he
[48:32] had to really put something in Jeremiah
[48:33] because Jeremiah didn't want to do the
[48:35] job a true servant never wants to really
[48:38] do the job but he told Jeremiah he said
[48:42] listen before I formed thee in thy belly
[48:46] I knew thee and before that came forth
[48:50] out of your mother's womb I sanctified
[48:52] thee and how I be a prophet unto it unto
[48:56] the nation don't you understand if God
[49:00] has made us priests and kings before we
[49:03] were formed in our mother's womb that's
[49:05] what we were thank God sanctified us
[49:09] even dear
[49:12] Oh Lord I cannot speak I don't care
[49:16] about you in that sense we all give
[49:19] excuses Oh Lord I can't do this I can't
[49:21] do that God said but I called you yes
[49:25] but the Lord said unto me say not I am a
[49:28] child but thou shalt go to all that I
[49:32] have Cindy and whatsoever I commanded
[49:35] thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of
[49:37] their faces for I am with thee to
[49:40] deliver thee saith the LORD even then
[49:42] people would not have their faces when
[49:44] the preacher preached when they know
[49:49] like the word they did not it up but God
[49:51] said don't be afraid of that faces like
[49:55] I said many people don't even know that
[49:57] God behind bad to skin when he's
[49:59] preaching they think Jeremiah is annoyed
[50:01] all the reason why he is because God has
[50:04] told him all hey man he then Jeremiah
[50:08] judging the people is God through
[50:10] Jeremiah
[50:11] that's judging the people hmm we break
[50:16] his heart we break God's heart if I
[50:20] could say like this we cause God to
[50:22] agree you say that's not Scripture it is
[50:24] the Bible said it repented God in the
[50:28] days of Noah that he even made man now
[50:32] that's that's bad that's real bad you
[50:35] think God was smiling when he said that
[50:38] no sir if a spirit could cry he cried I
[50:45] hope this is all right Jeremiah the very
[50:49] name of Jeremiah means exaltation of the
[50:53] Lord God to a praise of men nobody
[50:56] exalted God everybody'd exhausted all of
[50:59] it fees everything God gave them they
[51:02] will exalt it all kinds of gods look at
[51:05] this and look at that miss that they did
[51:07] all of that but they nobody wanted to
[51:10] exalt God you don't hear God people in
[51:13] the street saying praise the Lord God
[51:15] bless you all those things will be used
[51:17] you don't hear it even among the message
[51:20] you came highly find the joy in the camp
[51:22] fire because you failed to praise Him
[51:26] the Bible says Amen that that God
[51:29] inhabits the praise of the people but
[51:33] we've got my shame just like Israel we
[51:35] look at the world like they're the ones
[51:37] prospering yes they're prospering but
[51:39] they're on their way to hell which one
[51:44] you rather have going to heaven are
[51:48] going to hell and somehow people don't
[51:51] they think God don't you understand this
[51:55] is the last go-round there's a lot
[51:58] coming another chance and the Gentile
[52:00] days are numbered one of these old days
[52:04] that door would be shot and the prophet
[52:07] of God said the preachers will be
[52:08] preaching still like people can be saved
[52:10] it won't be possible today when you hear
[52:16] his voice harden not your heart
[52:18] according to the Jewish tradition
[52:21] Jeremiah that he was the author of the
[52:23] Book of Jeremiah and the Book of Kings
[52:25] in the Book of Lamentations amen so you
[52:29] understand that
[52:30] Eve Eve was that book of limitation God
[52:33] weeping crying warning telling the
[52:37] people about all the judgment and we can
[52:39] tell them don't you know California's
[52:40] gonna drop oh yeah we know
[52:42] but nobody's preparing to escape all we
[52:49] can tell them hey man don't you know
[52:50] there's a bomb coming our way
[52:52] don't y'all know that brother Branham
[52:55] said there is a bomb that's gonna drop
[52:57] but the bride will be going but we say
[53:00] oh well we bride bride is not just a
[53:04] figure of speech it is a life it is a
[53:08] life the life of Christ in you is what
[53:11] make you bride not because you say I'm
[53:14] immensities or Baptist or Presbyterian
[53:16] or Catholic that means nothing with God
[53:18] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[53:30] you gotta believe you gotta believe God
[53:32] that God can change you if God can't
[53:35] change you it's because you won't allow
[53:37] him to God works by faith without faith
[53:42] it's impossible to please him before you
[53:44] can ever become a perfect man you must
[53:46] believe that God could make you a
[53:48] perfect man and you keep looking at this
[53:50] flesh and everything and think God's
[53:52] gonna perfect this flesh he ain't workin
[53:54] on the flesh
[53:54] he's workin on the soul of a man it is
[53:57] that inward man that God is working on
[54:02] [Music]
[54:03] that the work that he's begun in me
[54:06] he shall complete it I cannot do it he's
[54:10] the one hallelujah but I will never give
[54:14] up on God because God will never give up
[54:16] on me Jeremiah 32 27 then said then came
[54:22] the word of the Lord and the jeremiah
[54:24] said behold I am the Lord the God of all
[54:28] flesh is there anything too hard for me
[54:33] he was pleading with the people trying
[54:35] to get that dead state Israel was
[54:41] terrible but so all the people in this
[54:44] day we can easily say Israel was bad but
[54:48] what are we doing
[54:49] well what are we doing we prostituting
[54:54] God's time we were doing everything but
[54:57] worshiping God and when I say we I'm
[55:00] talking about as a whole maybe some of
[55:03] us are not doing it some of us are
[55:05] probably diligent but my party is what
[55:07] will happen to us and God doesn't become
[55:11] your real lover if God doesn't become
[55:14] the center of your life what is gonna
[55:16] happen to you
[55:18] hallelujah the way we were now remember
[55:26] how you were when God first Savior how
[55:30] it was so sweet and so lovely and so
[55:32] kind so good Jeremiah says go and cry in
[55:37] the ears of Jerusalem saying thus said
[55:39] the Lord I remember thee the
[55:42] - of the youth the love of dying
[55:45] espousal when thou witnessed after me in
[55:47] the wilderness and in the land that was
[55:49] not song
[55:51] Israel was holiness unto the Lord and
[55:54] the first fruit of his increase oh that
[55:58] devoured him shall offend evil shall
[56:01] come upon them saith the Lord y'all
[56:03] remember that you remember the time he
[56:05] was so close to God
[56:06] that when somebody did you wrong you
[56:08] didn't have to do nothing God took care
[56:09] of it you didn't even have to say
[56:12] anything mean to them God will always
[56:14] come to your rescue I remember the days
[56:18] and my thing is amid those same days can
[56:23] be redeemed there was such a love affair
[56:28] it's like when sounds of shadow let me
[56:31] kiss let him kiss me with the kisses of
[56:35] his mouth don't you know if God don't
[56:38] kiss you you're none of his the Bible
[56:42] said kiss the son lest she be angry and
[56:45] that kiss is a covenant hallelujah
[56:48] cuz God only kisses his bride let him
[56:53] kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for
[56:56] that love is better than wine because of
[57:00] the Saviour of my good augment that name
[57:03] is as ointment poured forth therefore do
[57:05] the Virgin's love thee draw me we will
[57:09] run after thee the King had brought me
[57:12] into his chambers
[57:13] we will be glad and rejoice in thee we
[57:16] will remember that love more than wine
[57:18] the upright love V y'all know what I'm
[57:22] saying we felt that in prayer y'all know
[57:25] that when he would come near we would
[57:27] run after him no don't leave me
[57:29] hallelujah then all of a sudden his
[57:31] present would come amen we can just pray
[57:34] pray pray pray pray we just enjoyed it
[57:37] better than wine hallelujah when God
[57:40] would come into our own private prayer
[57:41] how good it was hallelujah that's the
[57:45] way we were and that's the way we should
[57:48] be nice but many
[57:52] become prostitutes claiming to be
[57:53] virgins prostitute as the prophet of God
[57:57] said don't mean sexually every time you
[58:00] can prostitute your time you can
[58:02] prostitute your faith go out and join
[58:04] some cult or some oh so cold former
[58:08] church your prostitute you are you're
[58:11] just as guilty as she was but the same
[58:14] Lord that forgave her has the same
[58:16] pleading mercy for you tonight see God
[58:20] can forgive you when you put all these
[58:23] other things in front of him that's
[58:24] prostitution you're not a virgin in your
[58:29] spirit you're giving all your time to
[58:33] everything else for God God don't like
[58:34] it is that all right Matthew 28 25 32 or
[58:41] 36 woe unto the scribes and the
[58:44] Pharisees hypocrites for you make the
[58:46] clean micki make clean the outside of
[58:49] the cup of the planner but within they
[58:52] are full of extortion sin excess now
[58:55] blind Pharisees clears first that which
[58:59] is written within the cup and plate and
[59:02] platter that the outside of them may be

[59:21] know of all uncleanness where where you
[59:25] talk about that ain't about that's among
[59:26] what we call the bride nothing change
[59:31] Jesus came to a church that look look
[59:35] perfect pure everybody
[59:37] it meant who was a Pharisee said they
[59:39] dressed properly they looked probably
[59:41] they came to church properly and Jesus

[59:49] outside he said but had I not come you
[59:51] would have had a cloak volunteers you
[59:54] scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because

[1:03:02] on out the way isn't that the way we do
[1:03:05] it oh god I want to be closer to you and
[1:03:07] as soon as God tried to bring himself
[1:03:09] closer we move out of the way why
[1:03:13] because we won't soft moving
[1:03:15] we won't easy living God draws you
[1:03:18] closer to him by way of trials hmm you
[1:03:22] go get trials and tribulation you gonna
[1:03:25] fight that right
[1:03:26] he said if any man follow me to let him
[1:03:29] take up his cross that's how you follow
[1:03:33] Christ by taking up your cross
[1:03:37] whatever he brings so be it lord I take
[1:03:39] it and I gotta suffer to know you is
[1:03:42] that right Paul said it I want to know
[1:03:45] the Lord hallelujah amen not only in the
[1:03:48] powerless reverential but I want to know
[1:03:49] him in his suffering o daru-salam
[1:03:54] Jerusalem now they killed the prophets
[1:03:57] and stonest them which are sent unto
[1:03:59] thee how often I would have gathered
[1:04:01] that children together even as he is
[1:04:03] gathered her chickens under the wings he
[1:04:06] would not behold your house is left unto
[1:04:09] you desolate
[1:04:10] but I say unto you you shall not see me
[1:04:12] henceforth till you say blessed is he
[1:04:15] that cometh in the name of the Lord did
[1:04:16] it happen 2,000 years ago Israel was on
[1:04:21] the top of the lap of I could say like
[1:04:23] that before Jesus came Israel was great
[1:04:27] but look what happened see see it all
[1:04:31] even even when when they were let loose
[1:04:34] from Babylon you think they would have
[1:04:35] left all that stuff 70 years in slavery
[1:04:38] with Babylon because God cursed them
[1:04:40] spanked them let's put it away put it
[1:04:42] put the rod to them because of their
[1:04:45] disobedience one of the things that they
[1:04:47] were disobedient in because God told
[1:04:49] them to let the land rest seven years
[1:04:52] all right every Sabbath every seventh
[1:04:55] year let the land rest and they would
[1:04:58] not do it because they were into their
[1:05:00] businesses and God said okay I'm a
[1:05:02] multiply your sorrow 7 times 10 is 7 and
[1:05:05] you're gonna stay in Babylon seventy
[1:05:07] years let the land rest when the land is
[1:05:12] healed I bring you back and all of them
[1:05:16] didn't want to go either
[1:05:17] and when they did come guess what they
[1:05:19] brought with them denominationalism and
[1:05:23] that's exactly what the message people
[1:05:25] have done instead of coming out of
[1:05:26] organization and out denominationalism
[1:05:29] and being free led by the Holy Spirit we
[1:05:33] denominated ourselves oh oh we're not an
[1:05:37] organization well you got the spirit of
[1:05:39] it hallelujah is this okay what is it
[1:05:44] people people gotta understand amen you
[1:05:48] and I must understand that God when you
[1:05:52] know God God God called Jeremiah you
[1:05:54] know the blushing prop he was one that
[1:05:55] literally cried a lot you know and he
[1:05:58] said brother BAM go says listen he says
[1:06:01] seeing the Prophet but the blood excuse
[1:06:03] me the blushing prophet of the Bible we
[1:06:05] blushed tonight I blush before you
[1:06:08] because of the sins of the people the
[1:06:10] people my nation my people have been the
[1:06:13] same of them out of being a shame of the
[1:06:15] Lord to see our young ladies walking in
[1:06:18] the street and act in the way they are
[1:06:20] to see the prostitution the young men
[1:06:23] living in all kinds of life see them
[1:06:25] staying home from church and reading old
[1:06:28] magazines they ought not to read looking
[1:06:30] at us as a program listening to the
[1:06:32] Hollywood City dirty jokes listen to our
[1:06:35] old wicked whoopies music another devil
[1:06:38] that hatches out from men that I hear
[1:06:41] faman got vile conscience the devil's
[1:06:44] influence
[1:06:45] to inspire the work of the devil on huh
[1:06:48] and we do all of this and say well you
[1:06:52] know I'm bright I'm justified that's
[1:06:56] what Israel say I'm gonna do all of this
[1:06:57] cuz he don't see us he's not aware of
[1:07:01] what all I'm doing God is aware
[1:07:05] hallelujah you say Oh God understands
[1:07:08] yeah
[1:07:09] the only thing God understand is his
[1:07:11] word God understands one thing and
[1:07:13] that's the blood that's all he
[1:07:16] understands he knows the blood he knows
[1:07:19] no color lines he knows no race line
[1:07:22] whether the man is black blue white
[1:07:24] brown or whatever color he is God knows
[1:07:27] nothing about that their sons and
[1:07:30] daughters he make them as his flower
[1:07:32] garden he likes to look at them the way
[1:07:35] they are and he says leave them be that
[1:07:38] way
[1:07:40] hallelujah but a lot of times people are
[1:07:42] Almighty you know how the world is even
[1:07:44] in the message you know people want to
[1:07:45] argue about whether Jesus was white or
[1:07:47] black or blue or whatever who cares oh I
[1:07:53] don't have people tell me yeah you know
[1:07:55] you know I'm gonna say it anyway you
[1:07:58] know we look at these people in people
[1:07:59] people look down because they are you
[1:08:01] black and skinned y'all they know that
[1:08:04] in this message what didn't you know
[1:08:07] that all the church age messengers were
[1:08:10] white that's a big argument but the
[1:08:18] point of the matter is so what if they
[1:08:21] were all white is that some credential
[1:08:26] there's the many white people in hell as
[1:08:29] it is black brown and whatever color
[1:08:32] more all that went down in those day in
[1:08:35] hell when who color they were y'all
[1:08:38] understand me your color don't give you
[1:08:41] some kind of edge on heaven jewel being
[1:08:46] a Jew doesn't make you believe me go put
[1:08:48] you to heaven cuz all Israel is not
[1:08:51] Israel and we look at things and we look
[1:08:54] at people people let me tell you
[1:08:56] something somebody said something to me
[1:08:57] the other day
[1:08:58] I want you to understand this I have
[1:09:01] always enjoyed who I was and I am I've
[1:09:05] never wanted our desire to be white and
[1:09:07] I hope and trust that a white man never
[1:09:09] desire to be black you ought to be happy
[1:09:12] about what God has made you
[1:09:13] I love the RAI your teeth myself you
[1:09:20] know we look at this thing it's Oh Lord
[1:09:22] have I'm a closing just a minute but I
[1:09:24] had to cry out because let me tell you
[1:09:27] something no prejudice period I don't
[1:09:31] care if it comes from the greatest man
[1:09:33] known in this message if your projects
[1:09:37] you will not make a rapture you got
[1:09:42] color skin color problems you were not
[1:09:44] gonna make it you're not gonna make it
[1:09:46] you follow this world up in this
[1:09:48] nonsense all you want to you know I was
[1:09:51] thinking about the other day if I get if
[1:09:52] I die because I'm black that ain't
[1:09:54] that's not gonna make me go to heaven
[1:09:56] Lord no they're not gonna make me go to
[1:09:57] hell what's gonna make me go to hell if
[1:10:00] I don't know Jesus if the blood of Jesus
[1:10:02] have not been replied God don't care
[1:10:04] about what color I am there is a
[1:10:06] provided way Isaiah 63 and says I will
[1:10:13] mention the loving kindness of the Lord
[1:10:15] and the praises of the Lord according to
[1:10:18] all that the Lord has restored upon us
[1:10:20] and the great goodness toward the house
[1:10:22] of Israel which he had bestowed on them
[1:10:25] according to his mercy and according to
[1:10:28] the multitude of his loving-kindness
[1:10:30] hello I will make mention how ain't
[1:10:35] gonna keep quiet cuz you don't believe
[1:10:37] in God I am so sorry for you but I'm
[1:10:41] gonna steal testify I was at the bank
[1:10:45] today amen and I had a chance to witness
[1:10:48] to her arm nah he wasn't rushing what's
[1:10:55] one of the Bosnian yes Bosnian Muslim at
[1:11:01] that guess what he even said he might
[1:11:03] come to church he knows exactly where we
[1:11:06] are
[1:11:09] the man was a
[1:11:11] to me you understand me God open up a
[1:11:15] door
[1:11:16] I gave him my num and he said he's gonna
[1:11:18] call me I said brother we get together
[1:11:20] his brother has become a Christian and
[1:11:24] when he found out I was a passenger's
[1:11:26] just like something just God good to us
[1:11:33] folks I'm almost done but I'm crying out
[1:11:39] before the Lord for you
[1:11:40] for me so that we can understand by
[1:11:43] God's grace that we are now being judged
[1:11:48] is that right some people say well well
[1:11:51] that's what we that's what this house
[1:11:53] here for the Bible said judgment first
[1:11:56] first began at the house of God that all
[1:12:00] right
[1:12:01] so if I am here the judge is here and
[1:12:04] the judge is the one who's judging you
[1:12:06] not me
[1:12:07] he's the one that's making me say what I
[1:12:09] say he told Jeremiah don't be afraid of
[1:12:12] their faces say it anyway because I feel
[1:12:15] like with all my heart
[1:12:17] amen just like the brother the other day
[1:12:20] he want to know what he's got this ain't
[1:12:25] a time to wonder it's a time to make
[1:12:28] sure my your calling and election sure
[1:12:31] he said what brother ha I said I'm gonna
[1:12:34] tell you something there's a provided
[1:12:36] way brother Branham preached it over and
[1:12:38] over again
[1:12:39] God's provided way you want the Holy
[1:12:42] Ghost go listen to the tapes because on
[1:12:44] there he gives you instructions he said
[1:12:49] a baby don't know nothing but how to cry
[1:12:52] for what they want say you can give him
[1:12:55] a bell to ring and it won't work right
[1:12:57] cuz he's not been instructed
[1:12:59] he said that's God's provided way and I
[1:13:02] said I don't care what these
[1:13:03] intellectuals has made you do that's why
[1:13:06] we're not living it because we need a
[1:13:08] quickening in our soul we need God and
[1:13:11] then to go down into our soul not just
[1:13:14] on our flesh in our spirit we need a
[1:13:16] soul revival I can't do it for you just
[1:13:20] like nobody just like it is a will have
[1:13:22] come to a baby chick coming out of a
[1:13:24] chicken
[1:13:25] right a chicken a chicken a chicken
[1:13:27] what's called Chiklis woopi-hey coming
[1:13:31] up a right you can't help him if you
[1:13:36] happen he's gonna die he needs to pick
[1:13:41] his way out of that sale he need that
[1:13:44] energy he needs that strength his heart
[1:13:46] needs that strength and you need it I
[1:13:48] cannot let you do it but you got to get
[1:13:52] in there yourself and back your way out
[1:13:54] of this world keep all until you crack
[1:13:57] that she'll so something happens in you
[1:14:00] and then you can crawl out of this world
[1:14:02] into a new world
[1:14:03] I can't do it for you you need to do it
[1:14:07] for yourself
[1:14:07] but I'm gonna tell you something don't
[1:14:09] be stupid usually for using that word
[1:14:11] don't be deceived
[1:14:14] don't assume because this is the most
[1:14:17] evil age there is Satan is deceiving a
[1:14:20] lot of people there are many won't make
[1:14:24] a rafter because they thought they had
[1:14:26] the Holy Ghost that's the word of your
[1:14:28] prophet in time you need to change and
[1:14:34] all of us know we need a greater walk
[1:14:36] with God I'm not saying you don't have
[1:14:39] it but my point is that for those of you
[1:14:41] who are not having you you know you got
[1:14:44] it but you're not where you should be
[1:14:45] then you should press this is your chill
[1:14:49] cry bill me Lord
[1:14:50] shake me Lord Mobe law I don't care what
[1:14:54] I got to go through just like I said
[1:14:55] this the other day down in Iowa City I
[1:14:58] said I don't care what cause what cause
[1:15:00] I don't care what he's gonna do to bring
[1:15:04] me to that place of where he's satisfied
[1:15:06] with me so be it they look at me like
[1:15:10] you sure you want to say that I'm sure
[1:15:12] this is time this is for a woman James
[1:15:15] said is a vapor hallelujah
[1:15:18] but that's eternal life I trade this for
[1:15:21] that don't be deceived you know I must
[1:15:29] thank God is crying right now he's uh
[1:15:31] he's he's he's looking you said I don't
[1:15:33] believe that brother brother Bradley
[1:15:35] said he'd be if he said it may even be
[1:15:38] what ten that make me meet the rapture
[1:15:42] he said it might be just like on one
[1:15:46] hand where's that gonna put us up put us
[1:15:49] it's more than that in here and you sure
[1:15:53] I don't yes because the foolish modulus
[1:15:56] people who around this message
[1:15:58] I know people today I don't know where
[1:16:01] the other ones gonna appear I don't
[1:16:02] where were the good the ungodly in the
[1:16:06] same I don't know where they're gonna
[1:16:07] appear but these foolish virgins were
[1:16:10] cut from the same material that means
[1:16:12] same message one just didn't have the
[1:16:15] Holy Ghost and one did and they were
[1:16:19] virgins
[1:16:21] best damn may God help us may God hear
[1:16:29] our prayer know that we desire more of
[1:16:32] him know that our desires to be what he
[1:16:37] wants us to be no matter what helped us
[1:16:40] escape this wicked world or help will
[1:16:43] help us escape ourselves Jesus Christ
[1:16:48] you are my lord in God and I know one
[1:16:51] thing what if God turns its back on you
[1:16:53] doing nothing can be done Israel
[1:16:57] probably thought because oh we're chosen
[1:16:58] race you know Abraham is our Father
[1:17:01] they thought oh oh we got it we got it
[1:17:04] me and Jesus said you don't and because
[1:17:09] you think you got it made he said you're
[1:17:10] gonna die in your sins and they knew the
[1:17:14] word better than we know it from the
[1:17:17] intellectual standpoint and nothing
[1:17:20] wrong with that I'm saying we need the
[1:17:22] word we need this knowledge we need a
[1:17:24] men God's understanding we need that but
[1:17:28] at the end of the day we need to live it
[1:17:31] when all said and done we need to live
[1:17:34] it and you and I'm
[1:17:37] understanding man that only God can
[1:17:38] quicken it to you oh you said Oh God
[1:17:41] help me to love you my brother he's the
[1:17:43] only one that can help you love is not
[1:17:46] something you can put all and it's got
[1:17:48] to be real and only God can make it real
[1:17:54] that's the criteria of this message for
[1:17:59] this day and that is divine love
[1:18:03] let's not fake it folks let's not
[1:18:05] pretend like it's there when it's not it
[1:18:09] is just a time this is the time really
[1:18:11] really is this is the time to really cry
[1:18:13] out to God and he'll say God have mercy
[1:18:16] staying much prayer as you possibly can
[1:18:18] you don't have to always be on your
[1:18:20] knees but you need to be in prayer I'm
[1:18:24] talking about me too I pray all day all
[1:18:26] day I do I may not be on my knees but
[1:18:29] I'm constantly praying some time it's
[1:18:33] out loud sometimes it's not but I'm a
[1:18:34] constant prayer but I know by God's
[1:18:38] grace if I did not pray the way I pray
[1:18:41] no telling what would be come of me with
[1:18:45] all the temptations with all of the
[1:18:47] thoughts and everything that comes to my
[1:18:48] mind o people y'all pray for me and I'll

[1:19:10] chance Lord let us not be ashamed of you
