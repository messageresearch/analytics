[47:01] yeah uh anyway let's just uh powerhouse
[47:20] known to us
[47:51] you know all of these things because
[47:52] you've lived issues and you recognize
[47:54] what we have need in our bodies
[48:00] also with our families lord you know
[48:02] what we pray for day by day
[48:18] but you understand
[48:32] let's
[48:52] amen amen thank you musicians
[49:07] okay if you get your bibles out it shows
[49:09] up in ecclesiastes
[49:13] for those who weren't here yesterday my
[49:14] name
[49:19] kentucky i go to church at church at the
[49:21] open door it's in
[49:22] indiana open door
[49:26] yeah and i bring greetings from our
[49:28] pastor
[49:32] it's nice to meet people in other places
[49:35] of like precious faith brothers and
[49:37] sisters
[49:43] i can never doubt that we have
[49:45] fellowship in the revealed word of the
[49:46] lord jesus for this hour
[49:52] uh if you go to ecclesiastes chapter 3
[50:05] verse 14 says i know that whatsoever god
[50:09] doeth
[50:09] it shall be forever nothing can be put
[50:13] to it
[50:14] nor anything taken from it and god doeth
[50:17] it
[50:17] that men should fear before him
[50:21] verse 15 that which hath been is now
[50:24] and that which is to be hath already
[50:27] been
[50:28] and god require it that which is passed
[50:56] [Music]
[51:00] i love i love it when i open the
[51:03] scripture and i see a statement like
[51:06] that
[51:08] [Music]
[51:16] so i actually had to pray over this and
[51:17] try to understand it like
[51:22] especially when i go to the book of like
[51:24] any books that paul wrote he uses these
[51:26] big words
[51:30] and they're trying to understand what
[51:31] he's saying and it's just like so hard
[51:32] to get it right
[51:42] then i have to go into the tapes and
[51:44] start listening to that and try to
[51:45] understand exactly what that means
[51:51] even though it's written in a very it's
[51:54] it's a very spiritual language
[51:57] spiritual if you read the bible it's
[51:59] it's it's heavenly honestly
[52:03] not just because it's english because i
[52:05] love english
[52:07] but it's just god if god condescended to
[52:10] put his
[52:11] his his own being his own substance into
[52:14] the written word
[52:31] coming from somewhere else but god put
[52:33] himself in there
[52:37] it's different because you can stake
[52:39] your life on that word right there
[52:41] it's completely different
[52:45] okay so here it says in verse 15 that
[52:49] which have been
[52:50] in the past
[52:58] and you're going to realize that i
[52:59] really love english because if you
[53:01] actually
[53:01] look at this from an english standpoint
[53:04] or whatever language you're reading in
[53:06] french
[53:11] he's using different tenses here
[53:23] he's the only one who can say one
[53:25] sentence and switch through three
[53:27] different tenses and it's totally true
[53:34] if you look at verse 15 it says that
[53:36] which happened in the past is now
[53:38] the verse
[53:42] and that which is going to happen has
[53:44] already happened
[53:47] and god needed what was in the past
[53:50] like what what is that even like no one
[53:52] else can talk like this
[54:04] if you look at it this way if you go and
[54:06] read your bible you look all the events
[54:07] in the whole old testament the new
[54:09] testament
[54:13] and you put it all together it all had
[54:15] to happen for you to sit here
[54:20] it had to happen exactly the way it
[54:22] happened
[54:36] okay so think of it every event happened
[54:39] here
[54:41] so god could put you in a certain place
[54:43] ready for the rapture
[54:47] so god could have you each individual
[54:50] sitting here
[55:05] okay if you want to go to ecclesiastes
[55:07] just go back to chapter one it's like
[55:08] two chapters before that
[55:12] it'll be verse nine
[55:17] it's another it's another tongue twister
[55:18] it sounds a little confusing
[55:25] verse 9 says the thing that happened is
[55:27] that which shall be
[55:30] seeking and that which is done is that
[55:34] which shall be done
[55:37] and there is no new thing under the sun
[55:42] verse 10 is there anything aware of it
[55:44] may be said
[55:58] in those two verses it said everything
[56:00] that's happening right now has already
[56:01] happened in the past
[56:07] or it's at least been said to happen
[56:12] now i like that word you just use
[56:14] declare it was declared to happen right
[56:17] here it's awesome so if you think about
[56:20] it god
[56:20] declares in his word that something's
[56:22] going to happen
[56:27] to us it's as good as done what he's
[56:30] saying
[56:33] what he's saying in these verses is that
[56:35] is as good as done it's already past
[56:36] tense because he said
[56:43] if you go to verse 11 there is no
[56:44] remembrance of former things
[56:49] neither shall there be in remembrance of
[56:51] things that are to come
[56:56] right there how do you remember
[56:57] something that hasn't happened yet
[57:02] i just want to know how just think about
[57:04] that how do i remember
[57:06] an event that happened only been monkey
[57:09] japanese if i didn't experience it
[57:26] if you if you listen to their revelation
[57:28] of the word that was spoken in the past
[57:34] you hear a message that brother brandon
[57:35] preached called modern events are made
[57:37] clear by prophecy
[57:52] and therefore when you see them happen
[57:54] in modern day
[57:56] declaration you automatically remember
[58:01] that prophecy
[58:04] so you remember something that's still
[58:07] about to happen
[58:10] let me give you some examples you heard
[58:13] that in the last days there should come
[58:15] perilous times in matthew
[58:17] 1
[58:35] [Music]
[58:46] you've never seen before
[58:55] jesus christ talked about them two
[58:57] thousand years ago jesus christ
[59:00] and he says as it was in the days of
[59:01] noah it is
[59:28] and therefore it becomes your memory
[59:30] whenever you see it happen in the future
[59:34] whenever you look at the newspaper and
[59:36] you see something else happen
[59:39] i remember that i shouldn't be worried
[59:41] about it
[59:43] you got it under control
[59:51] what does it say in romans 8 28 all
[59:53] things work together
[59:56] for good that them that love lord
[1:00:10] no matter how scary it is
[1:00:26] attacked no matter what happens i know
[1:00:31] it's working out for my god
[1:00:34] and god's gonna raise me to a higher
[1:00:36] place as a result
[1:00:40] just imagine those few scriptures can
[1:00:42] tell you all of that
[1:00:46] no one else can talk like this
[1:00:50] god can give you a promise
[1:00:53] a statement that's just so profound that
[1:00:55] whenever you actually think about it
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:01] one sentence can talk about your past
[1:01:03] your present in your future
[1:01:15] uh come let us reason together 1955.
[1:01:19] i'm not sure do you incredible translate
[1:01:22] sentence
[1:01:40] so this brother is talking to brother
[1:01:41] branham and he wants to see a vision
[1:01:43] like brother branham
[1:01:47] i mean i would love to be able to do
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:51] can you imagine he tells these stories
[1:01:53] over and over again
[1:01:56] testifies about how those visions like
[1:01:58] they told the future they told people's
[1:02:00] past
[1:02:04] he would talk to a man and see what he
[1:02:05] did last night
[1:02:09] under the cover of darkness
[1:02:12] no one else said but god sold you
[1:02:15] and then god would transmit it to his
[1:02:18] prophet is
[1:02:20] and he would be able to tell us what
[1:02:22] happened over there
[1:02:25] it's just a beautiful it would just be
[1:02:27] amazing
[1:02:30] i think many of us would be in this
[1:02:31] brother's shoes and be like oof
[1:03:02] and here is god's vision
[1:03:05] just open it up and open say
[1:03:09] god now open my eyes
[1:03:12] that i can see you he
[1:03:28] every time you open the bible it was a
[1:03:31] jew
[1:03:32] you'd see a vision of god do you want
[1:03:34] vision speaking forth to you
[1:03:37] i love this last sentence and i'm not
[1:03:38] going to read it yet it's like you open
[1:03:40] the bible
[1:03:42] you see visions like oh look isaiah saw
[1:03:45] this way
[1:03:48] not only that but if you meditate
[1:03:51] meditate over the world
[1:03:53] then you see god's vision for you you're
[1:03:55] gonna see yourself written in there
[1:03:59] you're going to see what he promised you
[1:04:01] in there
[1:04:02] the last sentence he says is set with a
[1:04:04] humble heart
[1:04:10] that means don't
[1:04:26] a lot of people fail on that one point
[1:04:28] because
[1:04:30] they try to take it and run with it and
[1:04:32] do something a little different from
[1:04:33] what his word says
[1:04:38] and that's how they end up off on a limb
[1:04:39] somewhere
[1:04:43] now there's uh there is
[1:04:47] there's a statement that's in the bible
[1:04:50] that you may have seen whenever moses is
[1:04:52] in front of the burning bush
[1:04:56] moses goes up to him in in of course he
[1:04:59] has the whole
[1:05:00] i am that i am and all that and he
[1:05:01] commissions him to uh
[1:05:03] go to egypt
[1:05:14] and then moses has this question
[1:05:18] because you have to remember at moses's
[1:05:20] time
[1:05:29] maybe they only had the book of job
[1:05:32] but i don't even know if he'd read it
[1:05:36] but he didn't have anything to base
[1:05:38] anything to base his experience
[1:05:44] on experience all he was doing was
[1:05:46] standing on a mountain in front of a
[1:05:47] burning bush
[1:06:01] what to tell his brethren the israelites
[1:06:06] because they would ask who sent you
[1:06:11] and he didn't know god's name
[1:06:14] so moses asks an honest simple
[1:06:31] like to i'd like to focus on this
[1:06:32] because keep in mind we're talking about
[1:06:33] different tenses
[1:06:34] in whatever language you're speaking
[1:06:40] because all language has a concept of
[1:06:42] past present and future
[1:06:44] long concepts
[1:06:58] just read your school and no one else
[1:07:02] the reason it's capitalized at least
[1:07:03] from my perspective
[1:07:08] because not everybody can say those
[1:07:10] words and it has the same weight
[1:07:27] so i can write that down on a piece of
[1:07:29] paper
[1:07:31] and eventually it's not going to be true
[1:07:32] anymore
[1:07:36] i can't write i am on a piece of paper
[1:07:51] so it wouldn't be true forever
[1:08:22] that
[1:08:27] whenever he said whenever you go to the
[1:08:29] genesis chapter one it says in the
[1:08:31] beginning god created
[1:08:32] created the heavens and the earth
[1:08:37] and god says something like let there be
[1:08:39] this did you have the let's
[1:08:41] see that word way back then when he said
[1:08:43] it
[1:08:46] even if it took millions of years for
[1:08:48] that to come true memphis is
[1:09:05] amen and then that goes true for all of
[1:09:08] his word whenever he's talking about you
[1:09:10] and he's talking about me
[1:09:14] just think of it this way nobody in
[1:09:17] history has that much power
[1:09:21] napoleon bonaparte can say i was
[1:09:25] uh because
[1:09:30] he wasn't eternal if you go back and
[1:09:33] pass you
[1:09:34] have george washington
[1:09:37] washington he could say i am back there
[1:09:41] and it would be a lie right now
[1:09:45] if you go to one of those great
[1:09:46] philosophers socrates
[1:09:48] um i think he said i think therefore i
[1:09:51] am japan he doesn't think anymore
[1:09:55] in impossible and he's not anymore
[1:09:58] because he's dead
[1:10:00] and what he said doesn't really have any
[1:10:01] weight with me
[1:10:03] it's not as much permanent and
[1:10:05] unyielding as this word
[1:10:08] if you can get that revelation and
[1:10:09] realize god said i am and it has that
[1:10:11] much weight
[1:10:27] then you can actually say that for
[1:10:29] yourself i can say i
[1:10:30] am hello because he came down and died
[1:10:34] for me
[1:10:36] because he was is and will be
[1:10:39] because he's eternal and gives me some
[1:10:41] of that eternity
[1:10:55] present tense continuous because it's
[1:10:58] going to continue forever
[1:11:00] it's never not going to be a lie
[1:11:05] i can say i am because i was way back in
[1:11:07] the thinking of god before the
[1:11:08] foundation of the world
[1:11:39] maybe i have that eternal life living in
[1:11:41] me
[1:11:43] i'm not saying we can we can say
[1:11:45] statements like
[1:11:46] uh we can't prophesy ourselves
[1:11:50] unless it's in the will of god once
[1:11:52] that's what's
[1:11:54] but we can we can still take that part
[1:11:56] of him and apply it to our lives
[1:12:04] of that character that he has
[1:12:07] anything that he's building us towards
[1:12:08] we can apply that to our own lives in
[1:12:10] present tense
[1:12:15] okay i have another quote concerning
[1:12:17] moses 1963 look away to jesus
[1:12:35] and when moses drive close to it he said
[1:12:37] take off your shoes for i am
[1:12:39] ill
[1:12:45] the prophet says now if you would weigh
[1:12:46] that word
[1:13:02] i
[1:13:49] now let's go to isaiah chapter 53 if you
[1:13:52] still have your bibles
[1:14:00] chapter 53 verse 3.
[1:14:04] isaiah in chapter 53 he's talking about
[1:14:06] christ and uh
[1:14:08] it's interesting the way he speaks about
[1:14:09] it because isaiah was a prophet
[1:14:12] isaiah
[1:14:23] so all of these people that he's
[1:14:25] prophesying to at that point
[1:14:40] okay so it's interesting whenever you
[1:14:42] read what isaiah is saying about christ
[1:14:48] and you break it down sentence for a
[1:14:50] sentence you can do this throughout the
[1:14:51] bible actually
[1:14:54] then it only works in the situation
[1:14:57] that god is talking about in that word
[1:15:04] in isaiah 53
[1:15:08] pay attention to the tenses now
[1:15:12] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:15:17] he's talking about christ about the
[1:15:18] christian hundreds of years before
[1:15:20] christ is born
[1:15:22] dissonant
[1:15:35] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:15:38] past tense
[1:15:43] he was despised
[1:15:49] so it seems like that the prophet isaiah
[1:15:52] is talking
[1:15:53] in past tense about something that
[1:15:55] hasn't happened
[1:16:00] that's where god wants you today
[1:16:04] he wants you to talk in past tense
[1:16:05] whenever you pray to him
[1:16:11] whenever you're seeking a promise from
[1:16:12] him
[1:16:16] the holy ghost past tense you're talking
[1:16:19] it's not something you don't even see
[1:16:20] manifested right now
[1:16:26] verse four it says surely he had borne
[1:16:28] our griefs
[1:16:30] and carried our sorrows
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:17:00] isaiah's day right there they were still
[1:17:04] living under the blood of bulls and
[1:17:05] goats
[1:17:08] but he says by his stripes
[1:17:15] so they're claiming that promise that
[1:17:16] god jesus christ has already died for
[1:17:18] them
[1:17:22] they had the revelation of that word at
[1:17:24] that time
[1:17:27] and they they had the revelation of it
[1:17:29] they could have applied it to their own
[1:17:30] salvation
[1:17:31] at that time
[1:17:35] it took the manifestation of that to
[1:17:37] happen
[1:17:39] for god to release the revelation on
[1:17:42] mankind
[1:17:56] that would happen in the new testament
[1:18:00] and that will stay until the end of time
[1:18:06] 1956.
[1:18:10] he's still talking about the same
[1:18:11] scripture
[1:18:13] he says he was wounded for our
[1:18:15] transgressions
[1:18:24] of our peace upon
[1:18:34] there is no negative at all in
[1:18:38] christianity
[1:19:24] and you think about how they had the
[1:19:28] who was the king was it darius i don't
[1:19:30] remember i think it was king darius
[1:19:33] the persian king his advisors have him
[1:19:37] uh have him trick daniel
[1:19:42] actually his advisors just tricked him
[1:19:45] because they made a law in their own law
[1:19:47] saying that since that king
[1:19:52] since that king is a king
[1:19:55] he was also uh he was also a
[1:19:58] representation of deity to them
[1:20:15] of exactly the way god should
[1:20:58] makes
[1:21:12] in history that's never going to fail
[1:21:18] because that's the way he wrote his word
[1:21:22] first peter 2 24. he's also quoting the
[1:21:25] same thing
[1:21:29] he said keep in mind keep looking at
[1:21:30] these tenses it says that we
[1:21:32] continue that we being dead to sins
[1:21:39] it's the second half of the verse
[1:21:44] being dead to sin should live unto
[1:21:46] unrighteousness
[1:21:48] unto righteousness by whose stripes you
[1:21:52] were healed
[1:21:58] and at this point the israelites uh the
[1:22:01] people in israel the jews and the
[1:22:02] newfound christians
[1:22:03] yes
[1:22:07] finally had the revelation of what
[1:22:08] isaiah was talking about so long before
[1:22:10] they
[1:22:11] before he came on the scene
[1:22:17] 1953
[1:22:20] the testimony of jesus christ
[1:22:34] and the only thing you have to do is not
[1:22:35] think about your senses
[1:22:39] or how you feel just believe what he
[1:22:43] said
[1:22:45] like that the scriptures cannot be
[1:22:46] broken
[1:22:49] whatsoever things you desire
[1:22:53] here is quoting mark you see
[1:22:56] when you pray believe you receive it
[1:23:02] it will be given to you
[1:23:18] but you got to think of it this way what
[1:23:20] he's saying in that quote is
[1:23:21] whenever you have faith in the word
[1:23:27] he says don't think about your senses
[1:23:31] faith makes you only think in present
[1:23:33] tense
[1:23:36] to claim your promises and what you pray
[1:23:38] for
[1:23:41] it also makes you think in future tense
[1:23:46] because you see stuff that's going to
[1:23:47] happen
[1:23:49] it makes you look in the past it's not
[1:23:51] written in the bible
[1:23:53] and you can't deny that it's true faith
[1:23:57] makes you think that way
[1:23:59] it stops becoming thinking it becomes
[1:24:01] believing
[1:24:04] just know it down in your heart you
[1:24:06] don't have to think about it
[1:24:09] that's what faith does for you john 5
[1:24:13] 24.
[1:24:14] you know john
[1:24:28] says verily verily i say unto you
[1:24:32] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:24:36] him
[1:24:39] everlasting life so
[1:24:42] this is all present tense if you're
[1:24:43] hearing my words
[1:24:46] whoever sent me you have everlasting
[1:24:49] life
[1:24:52] and shall not come into condemnation in
[1:24:55] the future
[1:25:10] automatically
[1:25:24] so if you're on the fence about your own
[1:25:26] salvation just
[1:25:27] just take that word into your heart and
[1:25:29] think about that
[1:25:34] that god's already saved you if you're
[1:25:35] already just
[1:25:37] visible you're questioning your
[1:25:38] salvation
[1:25:42] by his stripes we are already healed
[1:25:45] we were already saved you don't have to
[1:25:48] you don't have to question it so much
[1:25:50] you just need to accept
[1:26:04] one more scripture about tenses because
[1:26:06] it's just fun to me
[1:26:09] go to matthew 17
[1:26:14] matthew 17 10.
[1:26:19] it says and his disciples asked him
[1:26:22] saying
[1:26:27] why then say the scribes that elias must
[1:26:29] first come
[1:26:33] in and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:26:37] keep in mind they're talking about john
[1:26:39] the baptist
[1:26:42] coming before jesus christ
[1:26:45] so they recognize that christ is already
[1:26:47] there among them
[1:26:53] but they're confused because they didn't
[1:26:54] see when john the baptist came up
[1:26:59] they didn't notice that there that the
[1:27:01] scripture had already been fulfilled
[1:27:16] he said in the future elias will come
[1:27:18] the future
[1:27:20] he's obviously not talking about john
[1:27:22] the baptist
[1:27:25] john the baptist was already you know
[1:27:27] about his ministry
[1:27:30] and he says in verse 12 but i say unto
[1:27:32] you that elias has come already
[1:27:37] the same scripture in malachi chapter 4.
[1:27:41] talking about two different men one
[1:27:58] and he says likewise shall also the son
[1:28:00] of man suffer
[1:28:04] then the disciples understood that he
[1:28:06] spake unto them of john the baptist
[1:28:10] i don't think they understood that
[1:28:12] malachi 4 was coming
[1:28:16] they only understood the john the
[1:28:18] baptist
[1:28:21] even though god's word is eternal and it
[1:28:22] still has many things in there we don't
[1:28:24] understand that will happen
[1:28:40] there are many things in this bible i
[1:28:41] don't understand yeah
[1:28:44] i read through it the whole of last year
[1:28:48] and i came out very confused about many
[1:28:50] scriptures like in
[1:28:51] the old testament
[1:29:22] i read anything in here and i don't
[1:29:23] understand
[1:29:25] and i pray to god with a humble heart
[1:29:30] and i wait for that revelation to come
[1:29:36] that goes for things that i hear in the
[1:29:38] message and i don't understand yeah
[1:29:42] if i see brother branham in this
[1:29:43] scripture
[1:29:48] i accept what he said
[1:30:17] i don't know how many people here play
[1:30:19] chess i'm not going to ask you
[1:30:23] i love chester if you if you don't want
[1:30:25] to think about chess think about
[1:30:26] checkers
[1:30:29] there's so many different roles
[1:30:32] and and this is keep in mind this is
[1:30:34] god's perspective
[1:30:37] that we're talking about overall
[1:30:40] everything that he said will happen has
[1:30:42] already happened to the end
[1:30:46] in his perspective this little blip that
[1:30:49] i don't know six thousand years seven
[1:30:50] thousand years that the world's been
[1:30:51] around
[1:30:53] perspective
[1:30:56] just a speck in eternity
[1:31:00] to
[1:31:10] i was talking to the young people about
[1:31:12] the devil and what he sees and how
[1:31:14] he fought against god
[1:31:21] it started so way back
[1:31:24] when whenever the devil first decided in
[1:31:28] his heart
[1:31:29] to deny god's word
[1:31:38] god already knew when he created lucifer
[1:32:09] and he he didn't put sin in the heart of
[1:32:11] lucifer
[1:32:14] he just knew what lucifer would become
[1:32:16] isabel
[1:32:18] because god can't be a creator of sin
[1:32:23] that's something god would do
[1:32:26] so satan himself
[1:32:30] started playing a game the second he
[1:32:33] went against god's will
[1:32:39] i remember you to think about it as a
[1:32:40] game because if you play chess there are
[1:32:42] a lot of rules
[1:32:47] checkers or whatever it is
[1:32:50] okay so satan has been playing this game
[1:32:53] for
[1:32:54] thousands of years
[1:32:59] the oldest person in this room can't
[1:33:01] even be over 100 years old
[1:33:06] the devil
[1:33:15] the devil knows the word completely
[1:33:16] that's how he was able to try to tempt
[1:33:18] jesus
[1:33:20] completely
[1:33:47] and guess who wrote the rule book i
[1:33:48] don't
[1:33:52] who wrote the rulebook who wrote the
[1:33:53] rules
[1:33:55] who was the one who was writing the word
[1:34:00] so god wrote the wrong book
[1:34:17] and he can change the rules whenever you
[1:34:19] want
[1:34:21] just think about it the devil
[1:34:23] comes and he does his best to
[1:34:25] attack
[1:34:29] think of it this way the devil wants to
[1:34:30] attack you
[1:34:33] you have to get permission from god to
[1:34:34] try it
[1:34:36] out he has to ask god before he can take
[1:34:38] one of his pieces
[1:34:41] he can't just do what he wants to do
[1:34:43] even if it's according to the rules
[1:35:26] he's a complete loser from the get-go
[1:35:29] and he's still going to keep trying to
[1:35:31] play
[1:35:34] i want you to think of this this isn't
[1:35:35] actually a rulebook
[1:35:38] it's a playbook i'll leave the
[1:35:42] a playbook is in like if you're in
[1:35:43] sports and there's different plays that
[1:35:45] you're going to run
[1:35:49] to the christians it explains exactly
[1:35:52] the way god wants you to move
[1:35:54] explain
[1:36:07] god can change anything that he wants to
[1:36:09] in your life
[1:36:12] and follow it more of a playbook
[1:36:19] it's so sad for satan because god let
[1:36:21] him see it
[1:36:35] you know how insulting that is to him
[1:36:38] he understands just exactly how god
[1:36:40] wants to operate and what god's plan is
[1:36:45] we're going to lose in the end
[1:36:49] and yet he keeps playing may you
[1:36:51] continue kamehameha
[1:36:52] if it was me or you it's just
[1:36:55] common sense would say don't play that
[1:36:57] game just
[1:36:59] the the songs i wouldn't try to play a
[1:37:02] game against a grand master in chessy
[1:37:32] he's wiped off the earth
[1:37:35] god's will in his life has already been
[1:37:37] accomplished
[1:37:40] right now that god
[1:37:43] that he's just fulfilling god's will
[1:39:10] says being confident of this very thing
[1:39:18] that he which have begun a good work in
[1:39:20] you will perform it until the day of
[1:39:22] jesus christ
[1:39:52] upon there christian you can just rest
[1:39:58] we have to not forget that
[1:40:02] now uh right now i have to switch it up
[1:40:04] frank because
[1:40:05] the devil is trying to stop me
[1:40:10] and uh i had all my sermon notes for all
[1:40:13] the sermons i've ever had
[1:40:17] on my computer and it was set up just
[1:40:21] perfectly
[1:40:22] you see like the buffet and then somehow
[1:40:24] everything got deleted last night
[1:40:29] so i had to do my best to try to figure
[1:40:31] out how to get it back
[1:40:35] and i'm still struggling with that but
[1:40:37] he hasn't stopped the working of god
[1:40:39] today
[1:40:43] a bunch of notes on my phone
[1:40:47] okay let's just look at a situation or
[1:40:49] two where
[1:40:50] um situation where god
[1:40:54] is letting the devil play the game
[1:40:58] but he's not letting him win
[1:41:03] the first most obvious example is
[1:41:05] whenever jesus christ was walking the
[1:41:07] earth
[1:41:08] the example brother branham said the
[1:41:11] devil had
[1:41:12] a celebration that day because he was
[1:41:14] going to calvary
[1:41:39] he had so many different scriptures in
[1:41:41] the word in his word saying jesus christ
[1:41:43] would come back to life
[1:42:01] he didn't understand the revelation of
[1:42:03] what god was going to do in that hour
[1:42:07] so god took christ and raised him back
[1:42:09] up out of the grave
[1:42:12] and he had a greater victory after that
[1:42:16] than the devil had had his entire career
[1:42:21] simply because he thought that the devil
[1:42:23] thought he was winning in that moment
[1:42:51] took upon them to call over them which
[1:42:53] had evil spirits the name of the lord
[1:42:55] jesus christ
[1:43:01] saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul
[1:43:03] preaches
[1:43:07] so these men are using the word of god
[1:43:12] to try to cast out evil spirits in a man
[1:43:16] actually multiple people probably
[1:43:19] verse 14 and there were and there were
[1:43:22] seven sons of one skiva
[1:43:28] a jew and chief of the priests which did
[1:43:31] so
[1:43:34] and the evil spirit answered
[1:44:18] place and doing their best to believe in
[1:44:23] god efficiently
[1:44:25] and the message of paul the church age
[1:44:27] messenger
[1:44:31] and god said let the devil win this one
[1:44:36] but i want you to see what happens next
[1:44:39] verse 17
[1:44:41] and this was known to all the jews and
[1:44:43] greeks also dwelling at ephesus
[1:44:58] if you look at that you would think fear
[1:45:00] fell on them all because the devil's so
[1:45:02] powerful
[1:45:07] seven priests who were christians and
[1:45:09] sons of skeva
[1:45:14] sacrifices
[1:45:55] many of them also which used curious
[1:45:57] arts brought their books together
[1:46:06] and they counted the price of them and
[1:46:08] found that found 50 000 pieces of silver
[1:46:21] the devil is playing checkers and god's
[1:46:23] playing chess
[1:46:32] yeah so god's playing a game that's just
[1:46:34] a lot more
[1:46:35] powerful than what the devil is playing
[1:46:52] and in the end all of these people who
[1:46:53] were practicing witchcraft in that town
[1:46:58] begin to glorify god give their lives to
[1:47:01] christ
[1:47:03] many more people than what the devil had
[1:47:05] got out of this city
[1:47:26] so if you want to look at the two
[1:47:29] messages i brought to you this weekend
[1:47:34] yesterday i talked
[1:48:02] 1964
[1:48:07] says so politics is one side of the
[1:48:10] fence
[1:48:13] defense and i'm on the other is it i
[1:48:16] said i
[1:48:16] voted once that was for christ
[1:48:24] that's right see you got a vote coming
[1:48:28] god voted for you the devil
[1:48:56] if you accept those things she was
[1:48:58] accepted
[1:49:01] [Music]
