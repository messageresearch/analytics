[0:00] belong unto us and to our children
[0:05] forever amen the secret things belongs
[0:09] belong unto the Lord Our
[0:12] God but those things which are revealed
[0:15] belong unto us and to our children
[0:21] forever amen and belongs to us so that
[0:23] we may do all the words of this law
[0:30] amen let's go to uh
[0:34] ecclesiast chapter 12 verse
[0:41] 13 ecclesiast
[0:47] 12:3 man here the Bible saying Solomon
[0:50] speaking
[0:51] here saying that let us hear the
[0:54] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[0:58] and keep his Commandments
[1:00] for this is the whole duty of
[1:12] menen if you read here very carefully
[1:15] Solomon we know that Solomon was the
[1:18] wisest man on earth except for Jesus
[1:23] Christ amen and here he saying that this
[1:26] is the conclusion of the whole matter
[1:31] and that conclusion
[1:35] is fear God and keep his
[1:39] Commandments amen let's bow our heads
[1:42] father we humbly come before your throne
[1:44] of grace
[1:45] Lord to say thank you Father Lord thank
[1:49] you for keeping us alive Lord thank you
[1:53] Father for protecting us
[1:55] Lord thank you thank you Father for
[1:58] giving us another year father Lord Lord
[2:01] Jesus Lord now we here father Lord to
[2:03] serve you
[2:05] Lord we just pray father God that you
[2:07] help us Lord Do
[2:09] It Lord as you want us to do it father
[2:13] Lord we pray father God that you help us
[2:15] to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[2:18] God so that we can say whatever you want
[2:20] us to say
[2:22] father
[2:24] Lord Lord I took my time to study your
[2:27] word
[2:30] Lord to meditate on
[2:32] this and I don't know exactly how to
[2:35] tell it to your people
[2:37] father I just pray father Lord that you
[2:39] help me
[2:41] Lord so that they can receive this
[2:44] message Father Lord we thank you Father
[2:46] for
[2:47] everything bless our pastor wherever he
[2:51] is and bless the bride all over the
[2:54] world in Jesus Christ name we
[2:57] pray amen amen amen you may be
[3:01] seated amen I I'll read again here the
[3:04] where the Bible Solomon is talking here
[3:06] in
[3:08] ecclesiast chapter 12 verse
[3:12] 13 amen here Solomon is saying that let
[3:15] us hear the conclusion of the whole
[3:19] matter fear God and keep his
[3:23] commandment for this is the duty this is
[3:26] the whole duty of man
[3:30] amen if you if we continue verse
[3:33] 14 it says that for God shall bring
[3:36] every work into
[3:40] judgment with every secret
[3:43] thing whether it be good or whether it
[3:46] be
[3:47] evil amen so this morning by the grace
[3:49] of God will try to uh uh bring this
[3:53] little
[3:57] subject that we entitled fear
[4:00] honor and
[4:04] respect fear honor and
[4:08] respect amen I will try to go very slow
[4:13] slower than I usually
[4:16] preach amen so that everybody can
[4:19] understand or get something from
[4:23] this so the title will be fear honor and
[4:28] respect so in in uh in Deuteronomy 29
[4:34] where we
[4:36] read amen here is Moses talking to
[4:40] us he's saying that the secret things
[4:42] belong to the Lord Our
[4:47] God but those things which are revealed
[4:50] belong unto us and to our children
[4:56] forever that we may do all the all the
[5:00] all the words of this
[5:03] law and now here Solomon comes
[5:07] back and he says that the conclusion of
[5:10] the whole
[5:12] matter everything it's got concluded in
[5:15] one two
[5:18] things one is fear
[5:21] God and two keep his
[5:26] commandments so what is fear according
[5:28] to the Bible this fear that we're
[5:30] talking about
[5:32] here amen we're not talking about fear
[5:35] of being afraid of somebody or being
[5:40] scared amen so what is
[5:42] fear fear is having a deep
[5:48] respect and honor for
[5:51] God rather than being scared of
[5:54] him so having a deep
[5:57] respect in other words having uh uh uh
[6:04] reverence so to have the a big respect
[6:08] uh for
[6:10] God and
[6:12] honor is to have a higher respect or
[6:16] great
[6:19] esteem so in other words fear honor and
[6:23] respect they always go
[6:27] together so you cannot prophesy says
[6:29] that before you respect God you have to
[6:31] fear Him
[6:34] First and when you fear Him and you
[6:37] respect him that's how you honor
[6:41] him so how do you honor
[6:45] God Amen so we'll take a little story
[6:49] here of the meanest man uh uh the
[6:53] prophet preached about
[6:55] that I think his name was Simon
[6:59] yeah he he sent someone to go look for
[7:02] Jesus to invite him to his
[7:05] party and we know the story when Jesus
[7:08] got to that
[7:10] place instead of him taking care of
[7:13] him amen he left Jesus by
[7:16] himself he took care of everybody else's
[7:19] by
[7:21] Jesus amen and the prophet comes and
[7:23] said that that was a disrespect to him
[7:26] to
[7:28] Jesus he did not respect him amen
[7:32] because he did not take care of
[7:34] him he did not give him the attention he
[7:39] deserved he did not give him the honor
[7:42] that he
[7:44] deserved and it's the same thing
[7:46] sometimes what we do today at
[7:50] church amen we come to church and
[7:52] everybody prays Lord be with
[7:56] us when we come to church in our minds
[7:58] we have one one goal is to go meet
[8:04] God when we pray in the morning we say
[8:07] Lord be with the service
[8:10] today amen and the prophet says that God
[8:13] never misses his
[8:16] appointment amen whenever you call him
[8:20] amen it doesn't matter if you are a
[8:22] sinner or
[8:24] not God will show up amen but for him to
[8:28] bless you
[8:30] amen that would depend on on on your
[8:33] attitude towards
[8:36] him so it's something that you give to
[8:39] him and he gives you back so if you
[8:42] respect
[8:43] him you take care of him amen you give
[8:47] him all the honor he
[8:49] deserves amen he will bless you back
[8:52] amen noce that
[8:54] Simon was not a
[8:57] Christian amen Jesus ended disciples and
[9:00] everybody knew exactly who Simon was he
[9:02] was a bad
[9:07] man amen but nevertheless when he
[9:09] invited
[9:11] Jesus amen Jesus showed up amen because
[9:15] he was
[9:16] invited but the blessings that was that
[9:19] were reserved from him for
[9:23] him amen they were given to someone else
[9:26] who took care of Jesus
[9:30] so every time we come to
[9:32] church every time we pray in our
[9:35] houses or wherever we
[9:38] are amen we have to make sure to take
[9:41] care of
[9:42] him amen we have to make sure that we
[9:45] show him the
[9:48] respect amen that's how he will bless us
[9:51] back amen the Bible also talks about the
[9:54] story of Elias and his sons and his two
[9:56] sons
[9:59] amen the Bible says that those
[10:03] kids amen they were stealing offerings
[10:05] from the
[10:07] altar they were playing at
[10:10] church amen doing things that are not
[10:13] that that they were not supposed to do
[10:15] at
[10:16] church they were constantly
[10:19] disrespecting God's
[10:22] presence amen and we know the end of
[10:25] those guys of those two kids
[10:29] they all
[10:31] died amen and their father also
[10:34] died amen the prophet says I believe in
[10:37] the message respect if you read that
[10:39] message I'm not going to read it but if
[10:41] you read that
[10:42] message you will see that the prophet
[10:44] said that every time you disrespect
[10:46] God's
[10:50] presence amen there is a curse that will
[10:52] come after
[10:53] that amen so we have to make
[10:56] sure Amen to do our best
[11:00] Amen to always respect
[11:04] him let's turn to John chapter 2 verse
[11:07] 13-
[11:15] 16 John chapter 2:
[11:19] 13-6 amen it's a story that everybody
[11:22] knows the Bible says that and the Jews
[11:26] Passover was at hand and Jesus went up
[11:29] to
[11:32] Jerusalem and found in a temple those
[11:35] that sold oxen and sheep and doves and
[11:39] and the uh and the Changers of money
[11:48] seeding and when he had made a Scorch of
[11:51] of of of small cords he drove them all
[11:55] out of the temple and the sheep and the
[11:58] O and and The Oxen and pour and poured
[12:01] out the the changes money and overthrew
[12:04] the
[12:15] tables and said unto them that saw dos
[12:18] take these things hence make not my
[12:21] father's house and House of merchandise
[12:29] amen and the prophet comes back after
[12:31] reading
[12:33] this it says that this is the only time
[12:37] in the
[12:40] Bible where it shows Jesus Christ being
[12:43] mad at
[12:46] something where just Jesus Christ being
[12:49] angry of
[12:51] something amen and what was the reason
[12:55] because people disrespected the house of
[12:58] God
[13:00] amen they turned the
[13:02] church amen into uh uh a
[13:06] market they turned the
[13:08] church amen which is supposed to be the
[13:11] house of
[13:12] God which is supposed to be the House of
[13:16] Prayer am they they turn it to things
[13:19] that they they were doing and
[13:22] enjoying amen people starting selling
[13:25] doves and animals and and and and things
[13:28] for sacrifices
[13:32] changing money so it became something it
[13:36] became a
[13:37] market and as we read here Jesus St
[13:40] something and took up took two cords and
[13:43] starting to beat people
[13:48] up amen it start to drive out all those
[13:51] animals and setting them free and uh uh
[13:54] uh overturning tables
[14:00] why because they took the house of
[14:04] God and they made it a
[14:07] market amen they were disrespecting the
[14:10] house of
[14:12] God Amen because the house of God is
[14:14] supposed to be a House of
[14:18] Prayer amen when God told Salomon to
[14:21] build a
[14:24] temple amen when Solomon built that
[14:26] Temple
[14:29] says that every time that the children
[14:31] of
[14:32] Israel will have something in their
[14:35] hearts or a prayer
[14:38] request every time they they will turn
[14:40] themselves to the direction of that
[14:42] Temple and
[14:45] pray amen God will hear their prayers
[14:47] and will give them whatever they were
[14:51] asking amen because the church is a
[14:54] House of
[14:55] Prayer amen the church is a place is a
[14:59] holy
[15:00] Place amen a church is not a place for
[15:03] us to come and meet
[15:06] people amen a church is not a it's not a
[15:10] place for us to come and start talking
[15:11] to one
[15:14] another amen a church is not a it's not
[15:16] a
[15:19] playground amen it's a Holy
[15:21] Ground when Moses went to meet Jes when
[15:24] Moses went to meet God in the burning
[15:26] bush
[15:29] amen God told him to take off his shoes
[15:32] because he was standing on the Holy
[15:36] Ground when Joshua met that angel of the
[15:40] Lord amen that angel of the Lord told
[15:43] him to take off his shoes because he was
[15:45] standing on the Holy
[15:49] Ground amen when you see the
[15:52] archangels in the presence of God Amen
[15:56] the prophet says that they Clos their
[15:57] eyes and they Clos their
[16:02] nudity amen showing that respect that
[16:06] reverence because the presence of God is
[16:11] there and so this is the duty of all the
[16:16] Christians amen Solomon says that this
[16:19] is the conclusion of the
[16:22] matter fear God and keep his
[16:26] commandment so to fear we understood as
[16:29] we said
[16:31] earlier Amen to fear means to
[16:35] respect and to respect means to
[16:38] honor and we have to honor God's but
[16:41] God's house the house of the
[16:43] Lord amen as if God was standing himself
[16:47] there
[16:49] physically amen because this is the
[16:52] place where God speaks to
[16:54] us amen this is the place where we speak
[16:57] to him
[16:59] amen so we have to honor this
[17:02] place amen with higher
[17:06] respect amen let's go to uh uh uh
[17:09] Deuteronomy chapter 10
[17:13] verse2 so now let's go and and see what
[17:16] is fear according to the
[17:24] Bible Deuteronomy chapter 10:2
[17:30] the Bible here saying Moses still
[17:33] talking he says and now
[17:36] Israel why does the Lord the Lord thy
[17:39] God require of
[17:42] thee but to fear the lord thy
[17:47] God to walk in all his
[17:51] ways and to love him and to serve the
[17:53] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[17:56] thy soul
[18:01] amen what is God requiring of
[18:05] you amen is to fear
[18:08] Him Amen to walk in all his
[18:11] ways to love
[18:13] him to serve him with all your
[18:18] heart and with all your
[18:21] soul so in other words to serve him with
[18:26] love amen there is a difference between
[18:29] serving God because you have to do
[18:34] it and serving him with
[18:37] love amen sometimes we get so used to
[18:40] our duties at
[18:44] church amen us incl us preachers
[18:48] included amen we so we get so used to
[18:51] our duties at
[18:52] [Music]
[18:53] church amen you know very well that you
[18:55] have to show up to church sing and clap
[18:58] your hands and pray and then go
[19:04] home or come and lead the songs and then
[19:09] go or preach or play or whatever you do
[19:12] here at
[19:14] church amen so we do it so very
[19:18] often it becomes a
[19:20] habit it's just something that we wake
[19:22] up well toor today oh today is Sunday so
[19:25] we have to go and do whatever we're
[19:27] supposed to do come
[19:33] amen that is not serving God with all
[19:35] thy heart and your
[19:37] soul amen because you're not serving him
[19:40] with
[19:41] love amen you're serving him just
[19:43] because you have
[19:46] to amen it's the same thing with our
[19:49] jobs amen very few of us go to work
[19:53] because we love going to
[19:57] work amen we just go because we have
[20:01] to we go because we know that we have to
[20:04] feed our
[20:06] families amen we have bills to take care
[20:09] of so we have no other choice but to
[20:13] go amen this is the same thing with
[20:16] Christians they go because they know as
[20:19] being
[20:21] Christian people are expecting them to
[20:24] go to
[20:26] church people are expecting them to show
[20:29] up every every
[20:32] service amen but they're no longer going
[20:35] because of that
[20:37] love amen but they're going just because
[20:40] they have to show off to show up their
[20:44] presence amen that's the reason why
[20:47] people come late their
[20:49] church amen because they don't come with
[20:51] that
[20:52] love amen that's the reason why people
[20:55] don't sing as loud as they can at church
[20:59] amen because it's no longer with that
[21:01] love that they do
[21:03] it amen it's just a something that they
[21:05] have to show off the
[21:08] appearance that the pastor saw me today
[21:10] at
[21:11] church I have a specific place where I
[21:14] sit so I have to be
[21:16] there if people see me missing they will
[21:19] come and start calling me so I have just
[21:21] to show
[21:25] up amen but we have to do it with love
[21:30] amen remember when you were when you
[21:31] were once
[21:34] saved or when you just receive the holy
[21:38] spirit amen you were serving God with
[21:42] love amen missing church for you was
[21:44] compared to
[21:47] death amen you were praying all the
[21:50] time reading your Bible all the
[21:53] time amen fasting all the
[21:56] time amen so now the question
[21:59] years how long has it been since you've
[22:01] done
[22:04] it amen how is your walk with Christ
[22:07] right
[22:08] now amen are you going up or are you
[22:11] going
[22:12] down amen taking too much
[22:17] responsibilities amen that you are not
[22:19] forced to work much bunch of
[22:24] overtimes amen that's making you come to
[22:26] church late and when you come you as
[22:28] sleep
[22:30] sleeping because you don't have enough
[22:33] time to
[22:34] rest amen but we have to start taking it
[22:38] very
[22:39] seriously amen coming to church has to
[22:42] be as if you're going to meet a
[22:46] president amen if you go meet Donald
[22:49] Trump or Joe
[22:51] Biden Donald Trump Jo Biden amen you
[22:55] will make sure that you have your best
[22:56] dress on
[23:00] you make sure that you are on your best
[23:05] behaviors and you're behaving yourself
[23:09] accordingly but how do we treat
[23:12] God how do we treat
[23:15] him it's not because we're not seeing
[23:18] many death in our family that that means
[23:20] that God is pleased with our behaviors
[23:28] other trials and some of the tests that
[23:30] we go through it's because of our own
[23:32] behaviors and our disrespect to
[23:37] God Amen in the message law or Grace
[23:39] paragraph
[23:42] 63 paragraph
[23:45] 63 the prophet here says that
[23:49] now we ought to come to church with the
[23:51] highest reverence the highest of
[23:56] reverence we are to enter enter we have
[23:59] to enter the church like real saint of
[24:04] God walk over and take our
[24:08] position and keep our minds on
[24:11] Christ we are to forsake everything of
[24:14] the world like
[24:17] that and if you are really born
[24:21] again he said that this may cut just a
[24:24] little
[24:26] bit but you know this is the House of
[24:30] Correction if you are really born of the
[24:33] spirit of
[24:35] God that's where your heart
[24:39] lays amen your thought is your thought
[24:41] is anchored
[24:43] Yonder amen we have to come to church
[24:46] with a highest of
[24:49] reverence Amen to enter the church like
[24:52] real Sint of
[24:55] God Amen to come to church with higher
[24:58] of
[25:00] reverence amen it doesn't mean that you
[25:02] start getting ready when your alarm
[25:04] sounds at 8:00 a.m. or whenever you wake
[25:10] up but we have to start with the
[25:13] preparation amen if you have to go to a
[25:16] football
[25:18] game to go see Messi for your first
[25:23] time or to go see uh Steph Curry play
[25:27] basketball for your first first
[25:30] time you will not start to get ready the
[25:33] day of the
[25:36] game amen you will have to make sure
[25:39] that you buy your jersey
[25:43] beforeand and bring all the songs and
[25:46] prepare all the songs learn all the
[25:47] songs that people will be singing at the
[25:51] stadium amen you will get ready before
[25:54] the game or days before the game
[25:59] amen it's the same thing we have to do
[26:01] with
[26:02] church amen to start getting ready
[26:05] before we come to
[26:08] church amen Saturday
[26:11] night amen put yourself
[26:15] away amen start
[26:17] meditating amen expecting what God will
[26:20] do for you when you get
[26:23] there amen the prophet says if the
[26:27] Christians could come to
[26:30] church as prepared as all the
[26:34] preachers amen other people will be
[26:36] receiving healing every time they
[26:40] come amen all your needs will be
[26:44] provided amen because you coming
[26:48] prepared amen with an
[26:50] expectation but today so
[26:53] sadly people come to church without an
[26:56] expectation
[26:58] amen they just go to church because we
[27:00] have to go to
[27:02] church amen they don't even think about
[27:05] God before
[27:06] that amen they'll be doing something
[27:10] else amen contrary to the
[27:13] word and then just jump and shower and
[27:16] come straight to church without
[27:17] preparing
[27:22] themselves but the prophet said that we
[27:24] have to come to church with the highest
[27:25] of reverence
[27:30] amen enter the church like real
[27:33] sints amen this doesn't mean that you
[27:36] have to be all stiff and not not smiling
[27:39] or laughing or not smiling or you know
[27:41] having your Bible in your shoulder and
[27:43] walking like somebody who's about to die
[27:47] no no amen but you have to come with
[27:51] real sense which means that you know
[27:53] inside of you it's clear of all impurity
[28:00] Amen Let the inside of you reflect what
[28:03] is out well let the the outside reflects
[28:05] what is
[28:08] inside amen because it doesn't matter it
[28:11] doesn't benefit you to look
[28:14] holy when inside of you you're not
[28:18] holy amen so how can we respect God and
[28:22] honor God at
[28:26] church amen in the message God hiding
[28:28] himself in
[28:32] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[28:36] same paragraph
[28:41] 26 and this is giving few rules that we
[28:45] have to respect the
[28:50] church it's saying that and
[28:54] now this may seem a little rude
[29:00] but it's not a place to
[29:03] visit it's talking about the
[29:06] church it's a place of
[29:09] worship we should never even murmur a
[29:12] word inside of
[29:14] [Music]
[29:17] here outside of
[29:19] worship to one
[29:24] another we should we should never even
[29:27] murmur a word inside of here outside of
[29:29] worship to one
[29:34] another unless it's absolutely
[29:38] necessary see we should never rally
[29:43] around we should never run through the
[29:49] building or let our children run through
[29:53] the
[29:56] building Amen to jump he said that the
[29:58] Tabernacle folks uh uh knows know
[30:04] this that this building is going to be
[30:07] dedicated to the service of the
[30:13] almighty so therefore dedicating
[30:19] ourselves let's remember when we enter
[30:21] the that
[30:24] Sanctuary keep still to one another
[30:28] and worship God Amen it says that we
[30:31] should never rally
[30:34] around we should never run through the
[30:39] building or let our children run through
[30:41] the
[30:43] building amen this
[30:46] one I know this because I sit in the
[30:49] back
[30:50] there and when you see in the back there
[30:52] you see kids running in and out of the
[30:55] church
[30:59] amen it's not
[31:00] good amen because we're not supposed to
[31:03] be running a church inside of this
[31:07] building so meaning that every
[31:10] parent have to be responsible for their
[31:13] kids here in this
[31:16] building amen the same way you where you
[31:19] bring your kids here in this
[31:24] building the same way you have to make
[31:26] sure that those kids stay with you all
[31:28] the
[31:30] time amen not to let them run in and out
[31:33] of the church as as if it's a
[31:38] playground amen because this is a place
[31:41] of
[31:42] worship amen amen when we enter the
[31:46] sanctuary the prophet say keep still to
[31:49] one
[31:50] another and worship God Amen so when
[31:54] those kids run in and out
[31:58] amen that do that disrupt the the the
[32:01] the work of the holy
[32:04] spirit amen it's distracting the people
[32:07] people who are sitting right next to
[32:12] you amen and sometimes it's also
[32:14] disrupting the preacher who's
[32:19] preaching amen so it's not a good thing
[32:22] because we have to respect
[32:25] God Amen we have to honor him
[32:28] and we have to fear Him which means that
[32:31] we also have to respect this
[32:35] building when we come
[32:37] here another way for us to show respect
[32:40] to
[32:41] [Music]
[32:43] God Amen is to respect this building as
[32:47] well amen the prophet continues in
[32:49] paragraph 32 of the same
[32:54] message he says
[32:56] now there's there are little
[33:00] children little
[33:02] babies they don't know no
[33:06] different the only way they can get what
[33:09] they
[33:13] want is cry for
[33:15] it and sometimes it's a drink of
[33:19] water and sometimes they need
[33:22] attention and so we have by the grace of
[33:26] God dedicated a room
[33:31] room it was called a cry
[33:35] room but it's right straight in front of
[33:40] me amen Jump by next paragraph
[33:44] 33 it says that
[33:46] now it never bothers me
[33:50] maybe me here at the
[33:53] pulpit maybe I won't even notice it
[34:00] but there is other people sitting
[34:04] near and it bothers them see they come
[34:08] here to hear the
[34:12] service amen for
[34:15] us amen those rooms I mean they're
[34:18] outside
[34:19] there amen we don't have a specific room
[34:22] but outside there you'll see those three
[34:24] uh little closets for change B babies
[34:28] and
[34:31] stuff amen it says that sometimes they
[34:34] need a drink of
[34:36] water and babies sometimes they need to
[34:41] eat but they're not supposed to be
[34:43] eating inside of this
[34:47] place amen if they need to
[34:50] eat amen you can take your baby and you
[34:53] go
[34:55] outside and you feel free to feed the
[35:00] baby and just make sure after you do
[35:05] that you clean after
[35:08] you amen because we did not hire someone
[35:12] to clean the church we don't have
[35:13] someone that we hired officially to
[35:15] clean the
[35:19] church that we pay monthly for the for
[35:22] cleaning the
[35:25] church and also we are
[35:29] adult I don't think that anybody would
[35:31] love if somebody comes to your
[35:36] home and start throwing things
[35:38] everywhere and you'll be happy with
[35:41] it you will never like it because you
[35:44] want your house to be
[35:47] clean you want your house to be in
[35:50] order you don't want trash
[35:54] everywhere amen so is this is the house
[35:56] of God
[35:59] and this is how how God wants
[36:01] it amen our God is a god of
[36:05] order amen Our God doesn't like when
[36:08] things are not in
[36:10] order so which includes taking care of
[36:13] this building as
[36:15] well amen it's good to bring candies for
[36:18] your
[36:21] kids amen when they're hungry you give
[36:23] them chips and and whatever they do eat
[36:28] amen you cannot punish the kid to stay
[36:30] hungry for three 3 hours or two hours
[36:34] however the service will
[36:38] last but just make sure when you do
[36:43] that amen it's not inside of this this
[36:46] Sanctuary this place
[36:49] here it's outside there and when you do
[36:53] that clean after
[36:56] yourself amen don't wait until a brother
[36:58] or sister will tell you to clean
[37:02] up but be
[37:05] responsible amen and clean up after
[37:08] yourself that will make the life easier
[37:11] for
[37:14] everybody Amen to continue again he said
[37:17] in paragraph
[37:20] 42 he said that as soon as the service
[37:23] is
[37:26] dismissed leave the
[37:29] auditorium because you're
[37:32] through you're through in the worship
[37:36] then then go out and talk to one
[37:42] another and whatever you want to
[37:45] do if you got something that you want to
[37:47] talk to somebody to see
[37:51] them well you go with them to their home
[37:55] do you go with them or to their home
[37:59] or whatever it is but don't do it in the
[38:02] in the auditorium
[38:04] theori let's dedicate this to
[38:08] God see this is a meeting this this is
[38:12] his meeting
[38:14] place amen where we meet with
[38:18] him and the Lord Goes Forth from the
[38:21] sanctuary of
[38:25] course I believe that that will be
[38:29] pleasing to our Heavenly
[38:31] Father amen this is a meeting place his
[38:35] meeting place amen this is where we meet
[38:39] with
[38:41] him amen this is where he comes and he
[38:44] talks to
[38:45] us so when we are
[38:48] done I believe the pastor told
[38:51] us um believe couple Sundays
[38:55] ago since uh it's no longer it's not
[38:58] cold outside
[39:02] anymore amen we were advised to leave
[39:05] the to completely leave the
[39:09] building to go
[39:12] outside because when we stand there and
[39:14] we
[39:16] talk sometimes people stay here to
[39:20] pray or to meditate or to do whatever
[39:23] they want to do with
[39:25] God Amen we still hear people laughing
[39:28] and and talking and and shouting here in
[39:30] this
[39:33] build and sometimes it it it it's very
[39:36] hard to connect when you're praying
[39:37] because you still hearing people
[39:39] people's
[39:44] voices so we were told to leave this
[39:47] building
[39:50] completely amen by this Auditorium this
[39:53] place
[39:54] here amen it's a place where we meet
[39:57] with
[39:58] him amen that's the reason he was
[40:01] dedicated for that for that
[40:04] purpose amen where God will come and
[40:07] have the
[40:08] preeminence amen where God will come and
[40:11] have the
[40:13] authority where God will come and talk
[40:15] to
[40:17] us amen that's the purpose of this
[40:21] place amen if we turn again to Christ is
[40:24] the mystery of God revealed
[40:29] paragraph
[40:39] 84 amen the prophet says
[40:42] here the reason why I'm reading a lot
[40:47] here I don't want it to come from me
[40:49] alone to people think that this is
[40:51] coming just for me or brother Isaac just
[40:53] wanted to say this
[40:57] I wanted to show you to this is what the
[40:59] prophet himself was sing in his
[41:04] church that's those are the orders that
[41:07] he was placing in the
[41:09] church so we also have to respect
[41:13] it so paragraph 84 he
[41:17] says and now you've got tapes on
[41:21] that you've got tips on what we believe
[41:27] you've got tapes on disciplines uh in
[41:30] the
[41:32] church how we behave ourselves in the
[41:35] Church of
[41:38] God how we got to come here together and
[41:41] sit together in Heavenly
[41:45] places he said don't stay
[41:48] home if God is in your
[41:51] heart you can't hardly wait for them
[41:54] doors to open out y
[41:58] to get to get in here to fellowship with
[42:01] your
[42:04] brothers if you don't feel that
[42:08] way then I tell you it's time for you to
[42:11] go it's time you got to
[42:17] praying amen it says that we've got
[42:20] tapes on discipline in the church
[42:27] well you say well brother
[42:29] Isaac we live in a time of Grace which
[42:32] means that there is no laws and and
[42:36] stuff yes but there is still
[42:39] discipline amen the way we have to
[42:42] behave ourselves and in the Church of
[42:46] God Amen and that shows the respect to
[42:50] God because when we don't behave
[42:55] properly it's disres respecting
[42:58] God and when we do disrespect
[43:02] God there is a curse that will come
[43:05] after remember one day brother Bram was
[43:09] preaching and then two young men two
[43:12] young couples started kissing inside of
[43:14] the
[43:19] church amen and God told Brother
[43:21] brandham to say
[43:24] something whatever he will say will come
[43:26] to to
[43:28] pass amen because they were
[43:30] disrespecting God's
[43:33] presence amen when we come here we're
[43:36] supposed to have one
[43:41] Focus amen our mind is supposed to be on
[43:44] one
[43:48] thing which is God and His
[43:53] word amen and God is God is uh uh
[43:57] requiring God God is requiring
[44:00] us to respect
[44:03] him to honor him and to fear Him amen
[44:08] when we serve him we have to respect him
[44:12] we have to honor him we have to fear Him
[44:17] amen let's turn to Malachi chapter 1
[44:19] verse 6 to verse 8
[44:33] amen preaching
[44:36] this amen everybody is included me me me
[44:41] as well myself as
[44:44] well amen because sometimes it happen
[44:47] that you start taking those things for
[44:52] granted amen you come later Church it
[44:55] becomes a habit
[44:59] amen amen we just need God's grace to
[45:01] help
[45:03] us amen Mal chter 1 verse 6 to verse
[45:08] 8 it says that a
[45:11] son honor his
[45:15] father servant his
[45:19] master if then I be a
[45:22] father where is my
[45:25] honor if I I be a
[45:28] master where is my fear sayth the lord
[45:32] of hosts unto
[45:34] you oh priest that despised my
[45:39] name and he said wherein have we
[45:41] despised thy
[45:44] name verse seven you offer polluted
[45:47] bread upon my
[45:51] Altar and you say wherein have we
[45:53] polluted
[45:55] thee in that say the table of the Lord
[45:58] is content
[46:02] contable if you offer the blind for
[46:08] sacrifice is it not
[46:10] evil and if you offer the lame and
[46:15] sick is it not
[46:17] evil now the Bible says that offer it
[46:20] now unto th
[46:24] Governor will it be pleased with thee
[46:27] or accept that
[46:29] person see the
[46:32] Lord of
[46:33] hosts a son honth his
[46:37] father and a master honor and and a
[46:41] servant honor his
[46:43] master if I the Lord be a
[46:48] father where is my
[46:51] honor if I the Lord be a
[46:55] master where is my fear
[46:59] where is my
[47:01] respect where is my
[47:03] honor sayth the
[47:05] Lord you offering blind
[47:11] sacrifices you offering the lame and
[47:18] sick offer it onto the
[47:21] governor will he be pleased with
[47:24] thee or accept th
[47:28] person say the Lord of
[47:32] host you see well brother
[47:34] Isaac we don't offer animals Lambs
[47:40] anymore how can I offer a a blind lamb
[47:44] or a sick lamb to
[47:50] God Romans 12:1 it says that your body
[47:53] is a sacrifice offer your body as a as a
[47:56] living SA sacrifice to
[48:01] God he said that I beseech you therefore
[48:04] Brethren by the mercies of
[48:09] God that you present your body as a
[48:12] Living
[48:16] Sacrifice
[48:19] holy and acceptable unto
[48:22] God which is your reasonable service
[48:28] amen offering your living body as
[48:31] offering your bodies as a Living
[48:35] Sacrifice amen this doesn't mean that
[48:37] you have to kill
[48:39] yourself no but the way you serve
[48:42] him that is offering your living body as
[48:45] a living your living body as a Living
[48:49] Sacrifice so how do you do
[48:52] that do you do it with
[48:54] love or you do it just just because you
[48:57] have to do
[48:58] it how do you praise
[49:01] God do you praise him with love or you
[49:05] praise him just because you have to
[49:06] praise
[49:08] him he says that if I am your
[49:12] father where is my
[49:15] honor if I am your
[49:18] master we call him our
[49:21] lord lord means
[49:24] Master but where is my fear
[49:28] where is my honor where is my
[49:30] respect the sacrifices that you giving
[49:34] me if you offer it to your
[49:38] Governor is he going to be happy with
[49:41] you is he going to be pleased with
[49:46] you amen those are questions that we
[49:49] have to ask
[49:51] ourselves and examine
[49:55] ourselves if the if if a president will
[49:57] not be happy with the way we're treating
[50:03] God if we treat the president the way
[50:06] we're treating God right now if and if
[50:08] he's not going to be
[50:13] happy which means that we have to
[50:17] change amen we have to do
[50:20] better because Christianity it's not
[50:23] just a
[50:24] name Christianity it's a
[50:27] life amen your life is the thing is the
[50:30] one that determines that you're a
[50:33] Christian amen calling yourself
[50:35] Christian doesn't change
[50:38] anything amen calling yourself message
[50:41] believer or if and if you can call
[50:43] yourself Brandon I doesn't change
[50:49] anything but is your life worth of that
[50:54] name amen if you had to died
[50:59] today are you
[51:03] ready amen those are questions that we
[51:05] have to ask
[51:07] ourselves amen what do we do with
[51:10] God what do we do with his
[51:14] house what do we do with the word that
[51:16] we
[51:18] hear Amen in Ezekiel chapter 33 I
[51:22] believe amen but God was telling Ezekiel
[51:27] he said that people are excited coming
[51:29] to hear
[51:32] you not because they want to do what
[51:34] you're telling them to
[51:37] do but because your sermon is sounding
[51:40] as a sweet music to their
[51:46] ears amen you will see the pastor or any
[51:49] preachers coming here preaching
[51:54] hard and we go home we forget about
[51:58] everything amen those sermons has become
[52:01] a
[52:02] habit amen we don't even pay attention
[52:05] to
[52:06] it amen he has become sweet music to our
[52:11] ears and we're wondering why our lives
[52:13] are not going
[52:16] forward amen it's because we Mock and
[52:18] disrespect
[52:22] God by serving him with negligence
[52:28] amen because lack of
[52:30] Love creates
[52:33] negligence when you're not doing
[52:35] something with
[52:37] love amen you will be
[52:40] negligent amen you just doing it because
[52:43] you have to do
[52:45] it I'm just preaching because I have to
[52:49] preach I'm leading the songs Just
[52:51] because I have to lead the
[52:53] songs I'm coming to church just because
[52:56] I have to come to
[52:58] church singing or clapping my hands just
[53:01] because I have
[53:03] to there is no love
[53:07] behind amen first
[53:10] Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 12
[53:18] to13 amen and not the word to respect
[53:23] God is also to respect his servant
[53:28] amen first Thessalonians chapter
[53:33] 5 no let's read uh uh let's read the
[53:36] prophet first before we do
[53:38] that in the message
[53:41] respect paragraph
[53:50] 165 respect paragraph 165
[53:57] the prophet said that if you can't
[53:59] respect the
[54:02] man respect the office he holds in
[54:08] God that's exactly right see respect
[54:13] him if a minister comes
[54:16] up your
[54:18] pastor always
[54:21] respect I've heard congregations talk
[54:24] about their pastor
[54:28] how just talk about
[54:31] him ruin him
[54:35] down ridicule
[54:38] him how is that Pastor ever going to do
[54:42] anything for
[54:46] you I don't say this
[54:50] church but I mean churches I have
[54:53] seen you've got to love your pastor
[54:57] you've got to know that he is a human
[55:02] being but yet God has made him his
[55:06] Pastor the go the Holy Ghost has made
[55:09] him
[55:12] overseer then you've got to respect him
[55:15] in that
[55:18] manner and no matter what the pastor
[55:22] doing if you respect him in your heart
[55:27] as God's
[55:28] servant God will respect you for doing
[55:32] it amen Prophet said that now he's
[55:35] hearing
[55:38] people church
[55:40] members gossiping against their
[55:47] pastors ruining him
[55:51] down ridiculing
[55:53] him amen he says that we're not supposed
[55:56] to do
[55:57] it amen if he's a servant of
[56:00] God and if he's your
[56:03] pastor amen you have to respect
[56:07] him no matter what the pastor has
[56:12] done if you respect him in your
[56:16] heart as God's
[56:18] servant God will respect you for doing
[56:22] it amen a pastor's mistake is not a way
[56:25] for you to start talking against him or
[56:29] or or starting and starting gossiping
[56:32] against
[56:36] him amen the prophet said that he's a
[56:38] human
[56:39] being which means that he has
[56:42] mistakes but God made him his
[56:46] Pastor God made him an
[56:51] overseer which means that he has we will
[56:54] have to respond he will have to it will
[56:56] be accountable for your
[56:59] soul so no matter what he has
[57:03] done if you like it or
[57:05] not amen it's not a reason for you to
[57:09] start gossiping against
[57:12] him it's not a reason for you to just to
[57:15] start talking against
[57:18] him to run him
[57:21] down or to ridicule him amen but you
[57:25] have to respect him in your
[57:28] heart as God's
[57:31] servant and God will respect you for
[57:33] doing
[57:35] it amen this is the prophet himself
[57:38] telling us to do
[57:40] it amen it's not brother Brooks coming
[57:43] here and requiring you to respect
[57:47] him amen it's not Brother Sam coming
[57:50] here and telling you to respect
[57:54] him and respect it doesn't mean that

[59:57] being
[59:59] honest amen I'm not asking you guys to
[1:00:02] raise your hands
[1:00:03] on even some of us do not consider
[1:00:07] brother Brooks as our
[1:00:12] pastor because some of us still have
[1:00:14] other pastors or whatever choice you
[1:00:17] have to
[1:00:20] make that's fine amen because a pastor
[1:00:24] you have to choose him yourself
[1:00:28] amen but still you have to respect the
[1:00:32] man or you have to respect the office
[1:00:35] that that person
[1:00:38] holds it doesn't mean because you don't
[1:00:41] see him as your
[1:00:44] pastor you have the green light to treat
[1:00:46] him the way you see
[1:00:49] pleased amen you have to respect him as
[1:00:52] as a servant of God
[1:00:56] and God will bless you for doing
[1:00:58] so amen same thing with the

[1:01:04] chosen Higher Ground to be your
[1:01:07] church that you have to come and behave
[1:01:09] the way you
[1:01:12] want or show up whenever you feel like
[1:01:15] showing
[1:01:17] up amen it still is the house of the
[1:01:21] Lord amen God still comes here and bless
[1:01:25] people
[1:01:27] amen God still comes in this building
[1:01:29] and speaks to
[1:01:30] us amen the presence of the Lord is
[1:01:33] still in this
[1:01:35] place amen so for you have to respect
[1:01:38] this house because it's a house of the
[1:01:42] Lord whether it be your church or

[1:02:24] you
[1:02:29] and submit
[1:02:32] yourselves for the watch over your souls
[1:02:35] for the watch for your
[1:02:37] souls as they that must give
[1:02:42] account that they may do it with
[1:02:46] joy and not with
[1:02:49] grief for that is unprofitable for you
[1:02:55] have to do it with
[1:02:57] joy not with
[1:03:00] grief because when they're doing it with
[1:03:03] grief it's not profitable for
[1:03:07] you but they have to do it with
[1:03:10] joy and the way to somebody would do his
[1:03:13] work with
[1:03:17] joy amen it's if he's feeling that he's
[1:03:20] not doing that work in
[1:03:24] vain amen he's having help
[1:03:28] everywhere amen it's like
[1:03:30] Moses God told Moses that in this
[1:03:36] battle the victory will be will be based
[1:03:39] on you how strong you
[1:03:43] are go to the mountain and start
[1:03:46] praying every time your hands will be up
[1:03:49] in the
[1:03:50] air the victory will be in the
[1:03:53] camp and when you take your hands
[1:03:57] down defeat will
[1:04:00] come amen Moses was
[1:04:03] old amen obviously was the pastor of his
[1:04:07] church but he couldn't do that work by
[1:04:12] himself amen he needed people to hold
[1:04:14] his
[1:04:17] hands Amen to keep those hands
[1:04:20] up amen for them to have the
[1:04:24] victory amen same thing with the
[1:04:27] church amen the pastor is one
[1:04:30] person amen he can do all the works by
[1:04:34] himself amen he needs us Amen to hold
[1:04:38] his
[1:04:40] hands for us to have the
[1:04:43] victory amen because he will go out of
[1:04:46] his way to fast for
[1:04:51] you amen he will go out of all of his
[1:04:54] way to pray for you
[1:04:57] or or be away from his family just for
[1:05:00] you to receive a
[1:05:05] word so we have to respect that
[1:05:09] work amen we have to all respect that
[1:05:12] work and God will bless us by doing
[1:05:18] so Amen in first Thessalonians where we
