[12:30] lady I'm sorry I don't know your name
[12:32] I'd say it I'd probably say it wrong but
[12:34] the presence of the Lord was very close
[12:38] to you and we are thankful that God is
[12:43] mindful of us of all of us and so we are
[12:49] blessed to know Jesus Christ today we
[12:57] are how many went home and and made good
[13:03] on your promise that you're going to
[13:05] start to do better about fellowshipping
[13:08] with each other and encouraging each
[13:11] other helping each other you know Jesus
[13:19] there's an old song that we sang Jesus
[13:24] walked along the shore one day heavy
[13:26] Curtin's love for others on him lay what
[13:31] was he doing he was looking for a friend
[13:34] he was looking for 12 men who would
[13:37] gladly follow all the way if Jesus God
[13:42] Himself needed a friend we do - we do -
[13:47] and everybody knows it's hard to be a
[13:53] friend with somebody who don't
[13:54] understand what you're going through
[13:56] you know if you if you are a person who
[14:00] don't drink alcohol with beer and whisky
[14:03] and things and you try to fellowship
[14:06] with somebody who does there ain't much
[14:08] fellowship because what he loves and
[14:12] what you love is two different things
[14:13] and so you want to talk about something
[14:16] you love and he wants to talk about
[14:17] something he loves
[14:18] next thing he knows like you don't like
[14:20] to drink oh well what are we doing
[14:22] together you ain't got nothing in common
[14:25] and so it's much easier to reach out to
[14:31] each other and on it's hard sometimes
[14:34] when we say brother would you pray for
[14:37] me sister would you pray for me I'm
[14:40] going through something the reason is is
[14:42] because we all want to be strong you
[14:47] know but that's not when God is
[14:48] glorified what did God tell Paul he said
[14:52] when you are weak then I am made strong
[14:57] my strength is perfected in your
[15:00] weakness what did Paul say therefore I
[15:03] will glory in my infirmities
[15:08] now that's against Christian principles
[15:11] isn't it it isn't but it is here because
[15:17] we want to be we don't want to need help
[15:20] we want everybody need help from me but
[15:26] that's not what Jesus did
[15:29] Jesus I will glorify glory in my
[15:33] infirmities in you so thank God for His
[15:38] mercy we want to thank you sisters for
[15:43] the song that was very fine brother very
[15:46] fine for the music god bless you sir
[15:51] thank you we want to look at something
[15:57] here tonight just a very few of us here
[16:02] well we want to look at something in the
[16:04] book of first Corinthians chapter 3 and
[16:12] verse I won't
[16:22] in Romans well I I got up getting the
[16:25] right book first Corinthians chapter 3
[16:31] and we're going to read 21 22 and 23
[16:43] therefore let no man glory in men for
[16:51] all things are yours whether Paul or
[16:58] Apollo's or Cephas and Cephas is Peter
[17:04] or the world or life or death or things
[17:10] present or things to come all are yours
[17:17] and here Christ's and Christ is God's
[17:24] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[17:27] word you can be seated all are yours do
[17:36] you believe that all now that says
[17:41] whether Paul
[17:44] now who was Paul Paul was the first
[17:47] church age messenger those people did
[17:51] not belong to Paul Paul belong to them
[17:55] now that's the scripture or Apollo's now
[18:01] who was a policy a policy was a great
[18:04] missionary that went with Paul the
[18:07] scripture talks about some of the things
[18:09] that happened under him great mighty
[18:11] miracles talks about how that man even
[18:15] call him God but he belonged to those
[18:20] people or Cephas now who is Cephas
[18:26] Cephas is Peter the disciple of Jesus
[18:29] Christ the disciple of Jesus Christ
[18:34] he was the
[18:35] one that all the other disciples looked
[18:37] up to and said well he's kind of our
[18:38] leader after Jesus or the world all
[18:48] things in the world are yours is the
[18:55] scripture true now what's in the world
[19:00] what's in the world air light time dust
[19:10] structures buildings nature they all are
[19:18] yours or life what's in life everything
[19:30] everything I don't care what is in life
[19:34] it belongs to you or death their brother
[19:46] and I was talking about his wife passing
[19:48] away all that belongs to you all is
[19:53] yours Oh or things present what's
[20:02] present in your life today whatever it
[20:06] is it's not something that controls you
[20:10] it belongs to you therefore you control
[20:14] it how many read that with me how many
[20:20] read that scripture with me so I'm not
[20:22] making this up Emma this is God Himself
[20:27] speaking through the first church age
[20:30] messenger who set the example for all
[20:35] afterwards
[20:36] he's saying to you that you have it all
[20:45] whether it be a preacher a messenger an
[20:50] apostle or life or things in the world
[20:58] or death or things present or things to
[21:08] come I think I woke somebody up so what
[21:21] is to come it doesn't matter what's in
[21:25] it it belongs to you it belongs to you
[21:31] that's by the Word of God now does it
[21:35] belong to anybody who can read these
[21:37] words that's right it doesn't belong to
[21:41] anybody who can just read it belongs to
[21:44] a certain kind of people so do you
[21:53] believe that do you really believe that
[22:03] in life there's joy their sadness their
[22:10] sorrow their sickness there's pain their
[22:15] suffering there's overcoming there's
[22:19] redemption there's grace there's mercy
[22:22] all of that is yours all of it not just
[22:28] redemption not just grace not just mercy
[22:33] judgment casting away binding causing
[22:44] sickness sickness belongs to you
[22:53] why do we act like we belong to it why
[22:58] do we act like suffering is our master
[23:02] why do we act like joy has to come only
[23:06] when things are joyful if it belongs to
[23:09] us why do we wait why don't we take it
[23:13] the way we're supposed to take it no
[23:17] let's take a young lady and the reason I
[23:22] always pick a young lady is because we
[23:24] are supposed to be the bride of Jesus
[23:27] Christ and so if I pick a young man that
[23:31] young man would always represent Jesus
[23:33] Christ
[23:34] we're not Jesus Christ we're the body of
[23:38] Jesus Christ that's on the earth today
[23:41] but as far as being Jesus Christ we're
[23:44] not we're the bride that belongs to
[23:49] Jesus Christ therefore I always choose a
[23:52] young lady and the young lady that I
[23:57] have chosen to use as an example today
[23:59] is a lady that I don't think anybody has
[24:03] ever preached on and she was the
[24:08] daughter of a high priest of a false God
[24:13] ha ha how does that represent the bride
[24:17] because this daughter of the high priest
[24:22] of a false God became the wife of Joseph
[24:26] in the days back in Genesis
[24:31] now this lady will turn with to Genesis
[24:35] chapter 41 and we're going to take her
[24:39] life for just a little bit and all we
[24:42] can go on is the scripture I've never
[24:46] read any history books on this girl I've
[24:49] never read where anybody's ever done a
[24:51] documentary on her or even on her family
[24:54] or her father or the high priest of that
[24:59] particular time so all we can go off of
[25:03] is what the scripture says
[25:09] Genesis chapter 41 and we're going to
[25:12] read verse 45 and pharaoh called
[25:19] Joseph's name zaphenath-paneah I hope I
[25:24] said that right that's a big name and he
[25:28] gave him to wife asana --the the
[25:32] daughter of pot of Farah priest of on
[25:35] and Joseph went out over all the land of
[25:40] Egypt and what I want you to notice here
[25:45] is that this young lady I don't know how
[25:48] she was Joseph was thirty at this time
[25:52] he was thirty years old the Bible says
[25:54] so for you young girls are sitting back
[25:56] here he was an old man or some of the
[26:00] older young girls he wasn't old when
[26:04] you're 25 and single thirty is not very
[26:06] old but for you guys he would be an old
[26:09] man at that age at thirty years old and
[26:12] no doubt that there had been rumors and
[26:17] there had been gossip and there had been
[26:20] great things that were spoken of this
[26:23] young man Joseph who was a prisoner but
[26:27] yet he had come through from the great
[26:31] prison of death up to where he was at
[26:34] the very right hand of Pharaoh
[26:38] he was not a nobody he was eight
[26:43] somebody no doubt if they had the
[26:47] magazines in those days his picture was
[26:50] on every magazine as you walked out the
[26:52] grocery store and you look at the
[26:54] magazine every one of them had Joseph's
[26:56] face on and no doubt every young girl in
[27:01] that neck of the woods
[27:03] was dreaming of Mary and Joseph because
[27:06] Joseph had never been married and he was
[27:10] one hot man and they was looking and
[27:15] dreaming and talking and talent
[27:18] everybody yeah he's gonna pick me
[27:21] I know because he looked at me the other
[27:24] day that's what I've heard before
[27:27] whether is true or not ain't never had a
[27:29] guy look at me so I don't want a guy to
[27:33] look at me and so these young ladies
[27:38] were all dreaming of Joseph that they
[27:44] would become his wife
[27:50] now Joseph didn't have a choice of who
[27:55] his wife was and neither did his wife
[28:00] have a choice in the matter
[28:04] because the greatest king in the land
[28:08] didn't ask him who would you like to
[28:10] marry the greatest king in the land
[28:13] didn't come to this that's enough and
[28:15] say hey would you like to marry Joseph
[28:18] he said I have pronounced it and it is
[28:22] law Joseph shall marry this woman there
[28:28] was no choice in the matter but this
[28:33] woman this girl has enough I I think I'm
[28:37] saying that right she grew up in a
[28:42] religious home and she knew what it was
[28:46] to be a servant to a god
[28:51] because her father was the high priest
[28:54] and so therefore what he done at the
[28:57] temple had to be carried on into his
[28:59] home and she knew that what he said was
[29:04] as if it came from God himself because
[29:08] that's who she worshiped she worshipped
[29:11] the God that her father told her to
[29:12] worship and so she knowing this knew
[29:18] that her life was bound to that God but
[29:25] then the King came along with his great
[29:26] decree and he says to her and to Joseph
[29:29] you too shall become one and they became
[29:33] one but now while she this girl was in
[29:39] her father's household she was subject
[29:43] to every law that he laid down she was
[29:48] subject to it but when she married
[29:52] Joseph and became one with Joseph she
[29:57] was no longer bound under any of those
[29:59] laws what was she then let's read the
[30:04] very last sentence of verse 45 and
[30:09] Joseph went out over all the land of
[30:16] Egypt
[30:18] now what belonged to Asuna oh now she
[30:25] didn't have it all at one time but
[30:30] because she had a union with Joseph all
[30:36] that belonged to him belong to her
[30:42] so everything and the scripture says and
[30:45] he went out over all the land of Egypt
[30:51] what did the Great King say the Great
[30:54] King said there is none higher than
[30:57] Joseph except myself
[31:00] the Great King everything belonged to
[31:06] Joseph everything all the wheat the read
[31:12] the scriptures the scripture says all
[31:14] the land all the water everything belong
[31:19] to Joseph every man belong to Joseph
[31:24] every woman belong to Joseph everything
[31:30] belonged to him why because God had
[31:32] raised him into that place and it
[31:36] belonged to nobody else except his wife
[31:42] that was it every girl that dreamed of
[31:48] becoming his life dreamed of owning all
[31:50] that stuff as well but there was only
[31:53] one who owned it that was asking that
[31:57] that was the one who had become one with
[32:00] Joseph now read on further the scripture
[32:04] says that it became the law in the land
[32:07] that when the trumpet blowed every knee
[32:11] would bow to Joseph that's the word of
[32:14] God but what did a senesce do when the
[32:19] trumpet blowed she didn't bother me she
[32:26] was setting beside of him they were not
[32:29] only bowing the knee to him but they
[32:32] were bound to me to her also because she
[32:35] was part of him so everything that
[32:41] Joseph owned belonged to her after she
[32:47] had had a union with him now as long as
[32:50] she was still this daughter of the high
[32:53] priest
[32:54] it didn't belong to her but when she
[32:58] left all of that and became one with
[33:02] Joseph then it all belonged to her
[33:06] Derrick no doubt in the tally little
[33:09] story now I'm making this little story
[33:11] up to go with this as we're talking this
[33:15] one day Joseph had gone out in the
[33:19] caravan and he had done some business
[33:21] and as he was coming back the great
[33:23] trumpets were blown and everybody would
[33:25] stop and bow the knee and as he was
[33:27] climbing up the stairs to his great
[33:30] mansion his wife was in the house and
[33:33] the trumpets were blowing and all the
[33:35] servants in the house we're bowing their
[33:37] knees and he walked through the door and
[33:39] I said that says Joseph come here I want
[33:41] you to move this picture over to here
[33:44] well all the servants were bowing down
[33:48] why wasn't she bowing down that was the
[33:51] law she was above the law because the
[33:57] law pertained to her by becoming one
[34:00] with Joseph now all of these things that
[34:07] we just read all are yours
[34:10] only applies to you if you've become one
[34:15] with Jesus Christ why because he's the
[34:20] one who created them all he owns every
[34:23] one of them he didn't only make the
[34:26] physical things he made not only the the
[34:30] rocks and the hills and the waters and
[34:32] the rivers and the trees and the animals
[34:34] but he made powers described to me how
[34:39] you would make something called honor
[34:42] how would you make that I have no clue
[34:49] what is honor it's when somebody does
[34:53] something great and they get honored for
[34:55] it
[34:57] well how do you make that how do you
[35:00] make honor I don't know but he made it
[35:04] how do you make a government that has
[35:07] control over people I don't know but he
[35:11] made it how do you make high a
[35:14] principality I don't know but he made it
[35:19] so it belongs to him and if I can
[35:24] somehow leave being the son or the
[35:28] daughter of a religion and become one
[35:34] with Jesus Christ then all of that
[35:38] belongs to me as well but unless I do
[35:44] that it doesn't belong to me it still
[35:48] belongs to him because he's that he's
[35:51] the rightful owner of it now let's go
[35:53] just a step farther let's go to the book
[35:58] of Revelation and we're going to begin
[36:03] at verse or a chapter five I believe it
[36:16] is
[36:24] yes Revelation chapter 5 and I said
[36:33] verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of
[36:35] him that sat on the throne a book
[36:37] written within and on the backside
[36:40] sealed with seven seals now that book we
[36:46] know what that book was because God took
[36:49] that very book in this day and brought
[36:52] it to us it was the book of redemption
[36:57] and what the book of redemption was if I
[37:02] could take this book and make it in a
[37:05] way like that this being the book had
[37:08] seven seals or seven bands around that
[37:11] book was the people or the ones who were
[37:16] the rightful heirs to all that God
[37:20] Christ had created so this book was very
[37:25] important because it told if you if all
[37:32] these things belong to you if your names
[37:35] in here it belongs to you
[37:36] if your name's not in here I don't care
[37:39] how much you believe this is right it
[37:42] don't belong to you and so this book is
[37:45] very important now through the ages
[37:50] there has literally been millions
[37:52] millions billions of people who claim
[37:55] that their name is on this book
[38:01] but the book is closed so there's no way
[38:05] to know if your name is on this book
[38:08] anybody can claim it anybody can say
[38:11] it's there but until God takes these
[38:14] seven bands off of this book opens it up
[38:18] and finds your name you don't know you
[38:24] can guess you can hope you can have
[38:28] faith but once God opens that book and
[38:33] sees your name on there then God
[38:38] is obligated to do something to you
[38:42] not if you find your name on there we'll
[38:47] show you that let's read revelations 10
[38:57] now let's go back to five before we go
[38:59] there I want to read here it says verse
[39:04] two and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[39:06] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[39:09] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[39:11] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[39:14] neither under the earth was able to open
[39:17] the book neither to look on the book no
[39:25] man
[39:26] now that was you that was me that was
[39:29] you that was every person that's in here
[39:32] you was looked at at this time God
[39:38] brought your name up before him and said
[39:41] is she worthy to open the book is he
[39:45] worthy to open the book is he worthy is
[39:48] he is she is he is she is he every
[39:52] person on the earth every person who had
[39:56] ever been on the earth and every person
[40:00] who ever would be on the earth came
[40:04] before God and God looked him and said
[40:06] are you worthy and the answer was no not
[40:12] only to loosen and to open it but you
[40:15] couldn't even look at it
[40:19] you was before God and you were found
[40:22] unworthy so was every person in this
[40:25] building including myself including John
[40:33] now now let's turn to revelation 10
[40:39] let's read verse 1 let's read verse 2
[40:47] rather than 1 and he
[40:50] had in his hand a little book open now
[40:54] what happened was from the time where we
[40:56] read that there was a book that was
[40:58] sealed no man could look at it no man
[41:01] could even open it or even look at it
[41:03] that there came and laying forth who was
[41:06] worthy and he took it and he opened it
[41:10] up not here on earth in heaven and he
[41:18] began to look and whose names was on
[41:22] there and he said hey there's some of
[41:27] them people's names they're still on the
[41:29] earth all the other names are here in
[41:32] heaven but there's some still on earth I
[41:34] gotta go down there and take this to
[41:37] them not the ones in heaven it didn't do
[41:42] them any good because they were already
[41:43] dead they needed somebody to bring them
[41:47] back to life and so Jesus begins to look
[41:53] in the book and he says oh I see your
[41:57] name I see your name oh I gotta go to
[42:00] earth so he leaves heaven and he comes
[42:06] to the earth come in come in sit down
[42:10] somewhere you look familiar and so he
[42:16] leaves heaven with this book and this
[42:21] book is open now let's read revelations
[42:24] 10 - and he had in his hand a little
[42:29] book open and he said his right foot
[42:32] upon the sea and his left foot upon the
[42:34] earth now let's drop down to verse 8 we
[42:40] know what that other one was I was
[42:41] concerning a prophet that was to come in
[42:43] the land and he came a verse 8 says and
[42:48] the voice which I heard from heaven
[42:52] spake unto me now
[43:00] each person stop right there and where
[43:06] it says me you put your name there just
[43:11] like that little sailor boy told that
[43:13] old dying captain the old dying captain
[43:18] out on the sea he said I'm dying that
[43:21] was a little Christian boy he said you
[43:23] don't have to die captain he said how
[43:26] can I stop from dying he said because
[43:28] the scripture says he was wounded for
[43:31] our transgressions he was bruised for
[43:33] our iniquity and the chastisement of our
[43:35] peace was upon him and by His stripes ye
[43:39] were healed he said how can I make that
[43:42] real to me he said put your name where
[43:45] it says ye and so the old captain said
[43:48] by his choice
[43:50] captain John was healed and he jumped up
[43:53] out of bed and he didn't have to die now
[43:56] tonight can you put your name where he
[44:01] says and that voice spake unto who
[44:06] exactly who ever yours whoever you're
[44:10] looking at did he speak to you why if
[44:16] you weren't even worthy to look at that
[44:19] book just a little bit ago why would God
[44:21] that voice speak and say to you to you
[44:25] to you to you to you you go take the
[44:29] little book we can stop and say but I'm
[44:32] not worthy he said I know it but the one
[44:36] who was worthy took your place and so he
[44:41] would begin to say unto who me who did
[44:49] he begin to talk to who did he begin to
[44:52] talk to you he began to talk to you
[44:55] because when it says me when I read that
[44:58] that says me you've got to see you in
[45:04] the scripture
[45:09] spoke unto me again and said go and take
[45:12] the little book which is open in the
[45:14] hand of the angel which stands upon the
[45:16] scene upon the earth and who verse 9 and
[45:24] it says and what's the next word is that
[45:31] you is that you it's written but we've
[45:37] got to know it's written for us just
[45:41] like that ass enough knew that when she
[45:43] married Joseph everything and Egypt
[45:46] belong to her she had to know that if
[45:50] not Judah said Hojo's near um-um you
[45:55] think of us all right if I go down and
[45:57] buy us some fish for dinner she was his
[46:02] wife it was her job to prepare the
[46:07] dinner and so she didn't have to ask she
[46:11] says go get some fish because those fish
[46:15] belong to her by her union with Joseph
[46:20] now because verse 9 and it says and I
[46:30] went unto the angel and asked him is
[46:35] that what your scripture says what does
[46:39] it say and I said unto Him don't that
[46:46] sound a little biggity told that sound a
[46:51] little bit like ha you think you're
[46:53] something don't you know
[47:01] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[47:04] him give me the little book he didn't
[47:08] ask for it he said give me the little
[47:12] book and he said unto me who did he say
[47:17] it to again me take it take it are you
[47:28] unworthy not anymore
[47:34] why because you had a union with Jesus
[47:40] Christ what does the scripture says it
[47:43] says he who knew no sin became sin that
[47:51] you might become the righteousness of
[47:55] God through him not through me not
[48:01] through my church not through this
[48:03] message but through Jesus Christ that's
[48:07] the only place we can stand today you
[48:11] will never stand anywhere else I don't
[48:13] care how much in this message you
[48:15] believe the message is true but if you
[48:18] come to this message without coming to
[48:20] Christ first you were born in adultery
[48:23] and you can never stand to that angel
[48:27] and say give me the little book you will
[48:29] be struck with death because you have no
[48:32] right to that book but when he looks on
[48:38] that book and he sees your name then
[48:41] he's obligated to come to you with the
[48:45] book you're not obligated to go to him
[48:48] until that voice says to you go take the
[48:52] little book but once that voice what is
[48:55] that voice it's the voice of God and the
[49:01] voice of God would never tell you to do
[49:03] something that was contrary to the Word
[49:06] of God and so when that voice of God
[49:09] begins to speak to you and says you go
[49:12] take the little book
[49:16] and you take it
[49:19] remember you can't take it unless you've
[49:22] already been one with Jesus Christ once
[49:26] you've become one with Jesus Christ he
[49:29] comes and gives all to you all but did
[49:36] we read in first Corinthians all are
[49:41] yours whether it be a minister whether
[49:46] it be a messenger to the church eight
[49:48] let's read it again first Corinthians
[49:50] chapter three
[50:06] god bless you all come in come in I'm
[50:10] sorry I'm gonna have to start over I
[50:11] think well words we're going right back
[50:16] to the very first scripture anyway so
[50:18] we'll just kind of well kind of start
[50:20] over you wanted to hear it again anyway
[50:22] didn't you brother god bless you all
[50:24] it's very very fine every one of you
[50:27] here god bless you is very much
[50:29] we had a very wonderful singing a
[50:32] brother sang a song walk in the light oh
[50:36] we got a walk in the light where does
[50:39] that like lead what these two little
[50:41] sisters saying how beautiful heaven must
[50:43] be but if we walk in that light that's
[50:47] where it leads but we started our
[50:50] service sermon with this scripture first
[50:54] Corinthians do we need an interpreter no
[50:58] interpreter okay if we need one we got
[51:00] one right here if we if you think it
[51:03] would be better we'll bring him up
[51:05] it's okay okay I'm sorry I would need an
[51:09] interpreter
[51:10] i I you guys speak good English and good
[51:15] friends I don't even speak good English
[51:17] it's a no but first Corinthians chapter
[51:21] three and verse 21 if you have your
[51:27] Bibles with you if you need your Bibles
[51:29] if you need a Bible I'm sure there's
[51:32] some around somewhere does anybody need
[51:34] a Bible you need a Bible you got their
[51:37] phones oh that's very good I you know
[51:41] there's a great debate in the message of
[51:44] whether you should be allowed to carry a
[51:46] phone with the Bible on it I said really
[51:50] and you know into church because some
[51:54] feel you need to have a Bible and I you
[51:57] know that's fine but if you don't have
[52:00] the spirit this is not going to do you
[52:03] any good you got to have the Spirit of
[52:06] God before you can understand this
[52:08] anyway whether it comes on this form or
[52:13] on the phone like the phone
[52:16] important part
[52:17] the Spirit of God so we began to read in
[52:25] 1st Corinthians chapter 3 verse 21 I
[52:31] will try to slow down a little bit I see
[52:35] them interpreting some so I'll slow down
[52:36] a little bit I get very excited I I'm
[52:41] sorry
[52:42] 1st Corinthians chapter 3 verse 21
[52:48] therefore let no man glory in men for
[52:57] all things are yours all things are
[53:03] yours now let's read verse 22 whether
[53:07] Paul who was Paul he's a first Church
[53:12] age of messenger whether Paul or
[53:17] Apollo's now who was Apollo's he was a
[53:21] missionary an apostle and what did God
[53:25] say he set first in the church apostles
[53:30] isn't that what the scripture says and
[53:32] God set first in the church apostles
[53:35] then prophets so here we have a church
[53:40] age messenger and an apostle which was
[53:44] set first in the church and then it says
[53:47] or Cephas which is Peter who is that
[53:52] great apostle that we all look to that
[53:55] followed Jesus Christ they all belong to
[54:01] you the messenger the Apostles these
[54:07] great men don't glory in them they
[54:10] belong to you or the world what's in the
[54:19] world everything the air is in the world
[54:23] the storms the clouds the earth the
[54:27] nature the
[54:29] the the elements steal rocks animals
[54:37] whatever's in the world is all yours
[54:41] that's the scripture or life what's in
[54:48] life everything it's all yours
[54:56] or death it's all yours
[55:03] you remember brother branham said death
[55:06] is your servant death is your servant
[55:17] you cannot death cannot come and take
[55:21] you until you let it death is your
[55:29] servant or things present whatever's in
[55:36] your life right now belongs to you if
[55:39] it's troubles if it's joy if it's
[55:43] heartaches if it's if it's good things
[55:46] if it's bad things if it's wonderful
[55:50] things if it's hatred if it's bitterness
[55:55] if it's jealousy if it's trouble with
[55:59] your wife if it's trouble with your
[56:01] husband if it's trouble with your mama
[56:03] and your Papa you've dirt whatever it
[56:06] belongs to you that's not my words
[56:10] that's his words or things to come that
[56:18] covers everything it doesn't matter what
[56:22] it is it is yours every ministry belongs
[56:32] to you every ministry we've got it
[56:36] turned around today that we belong to
[56:39] the ministry how no what did Jesus
[56:42] Christ say he said
[56:43] it shall not be so among you for in the
[56:51] Gentiles the preacher becomes a big guy
[56:55] but it shall not be so among you let the
[56:59] little guy let him who thinks he's
[57:01] greatest become the smallest why because
[57:07] all things belong to you under one
[57:09] circumstance if you become one with
[57:15] Jesus Christ that's it
[57:19] I took the scripture in Genesis will
[57:24] turn to it again
[57:25] Genesis chapter 41 I thank God that he
[57:29] let these men come in a little bit late
[57:32] thank you God God needed to hear it
[57:36] again it's so I I a very grateful for
[57:41] that sometimes it seems like things are
[57:43] way off and God's like I got it don't
[57:46] worry about there was a young lady we
[57:55] read it Genesis chapter 41 and verse 45
[58:01] and pharaoh called Joseph's name
[58:05] Zephaniah and he gave him to wife a
[58:09] Sanath of the daughter of pada farah the
[58:13] priest of on and Joseph went out over
[58:17] all the land of Egypt you need to read
[58:21] it ok
[58:22] and so this lady was just a common girl
[58:29] just a common girl no great fancy things
[58:33] about her except her dad was a real big
[58:36] preacher that's what the scripture says
[58:39] was a priest in arm and so she didn't
[58:47] have a choice who she was going to marry
[58:50] Joseph didn't have a choice who she was
[58:53] going to marry the Great King brought
[58:56] them
[58:56] together as one and what does the
[58:59] scripture say happens when Joseph did
[59:01] that he went out over all the land of
[59:06] Egypt everything in Egypt belonged to
[59:11] Joseph but when this girl a senesce
[59:16] married Joseph
[59:20] it all belonged to her why because he
[59:26] was a good girl because he was a bad
[59:30] girl
[59:31] no because the King chose her to become
[59:38] the wife of Joseph now in order for her
[59:44] to become the wife of Joseph become one
[59:48] with him what did she have to do she had
[59:54] to leave her church her daddy was the
[59:59] priest of this church in order for her
[1:00:03] to become one with Joseph and all of
[1:00:06] Egypt to be gone to her she had to leave
[1:00:09] her religion what if her religion was
[1:00:17] the message
[1:00:29] ever become one with Jesus Christ and
[1:00:32] you believe this message you're in
[1:00:36] adultery because this message was only
[1:00:41] sent to the bride of Jesus Christ and if
[1:00:47] you are saying I am the bride of Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ but I've never become one with
[1:00:51] Jesus Christ you saying this message
[1:00:55] belongs to you that makes you a liar
[1:00:58] because you have to be one with Jesus
[1:01:01] Christ you have to leave your religion I
[1:01:05] don't care if it is a message religion
[1:01:08] you cannot be in that church and belong
[1:01:11] to Jesus Christ
[1:01:13] why because Jesus Christ is not in a
[1:01:17] church he's in his word and in order for
[1:01:22] us to be one with him we have to leave
[1:01:25] that just like this girl did her daddy
[1:01:28] was the high priest her daddy was the
[1:01:31] great preacher but she had to leave that
[1:01:36] to become one with him and when she
[1:01:39] became one with him all that was in
[1:01:42] Egypt belonged to her what does the
[1:01:47] scripture say he who knew no sin became
[1:01:53] sin that we might become the
[1:01:56] righteousness of God by him when we join
[1:02:02] with him one with him not when we just
[1:02:06] believe on him not when we just say well
[1:02:09] I believe God sent a prophet now when we
[1:02:11] say oh I believe everything that's in
[1:02:14] that message but when God Himself comes
[1:02:18] down and lives in that body and lives in
[1:02:21] each one then you become the message to
[1:02:32] the world where's the Prophet now he's
[1:02:39] not here
[1:02:41] now when the Prophet was here on the
[1:02:44] earth there was no doctrine of Malachi
[1:02:49] four five and six
[1:02:54] what was it if you wanted to see Malachi
[1:02:58] four or five and six you went and
[1:03:00] watched the Prophet it wasn't a doctrine
[1:03:05] it was living it came out and what and
[1:03:12] called you out it came out and told you
[1:03:15] what was going on it told you there was
[1:03:18] no doctrine involved with it
[1:03:21] no people believed it all right but it
[1:03:26] was not a doctrine it was a life that
[1:03:31] was when that word came off of that
[1:03:33] Bible and stood in flesh and discerned
[1:03:36] the thoughts and intents of the heart so
[1:03:40] if God had to do that in that man what
[1:03:43] does he got to do in you and unless you
[1:03:47] leave your doctrines and your principles
[1:03:50] of what you call church and join Jesus
[1:03:53] Christ he cannot do it he cannot live in
[1:03:59] you if all we have his church if all we
[1:04:03] have is our church set in the right
[1:04:05] order if all we have is well we sing a
[1:04:08] few songs and we do this but unless God
[1:04:12] can come and live in this body the same
[1:04:16] way he lived in that body it's all in
[1:04:20] vain let's go back revelations chapter
[1:04:26] 10
[1:04:28] how how how can Christ come and live in
[1:04:34] you how did Joseph manifest and bring
[1:04:42] forth life through his wife by becoming
[1:04:46] one
[1:04:51] himself spoke in a message called the
[1:04:54] token he said that great judgment angel
[1:04:59] is here in the land today the same one
[1:05:03] that was in the days of Moses and he
[1:05:08] said he's looking and there's something
[1:05:11] that he's requiring and he said he is
[1:05:15] not requiring you to believe the message
[1:05:25] he said if that's all you've got is
[1:05:29] believing the message it's not enough
[1:05:32] the death angel will strike what is the
[1:05:37] death angel looking for he's looking for
[1:05:42] the literal life of Jesus Christ in
[1:05:46] flesh bodies he's not looking for good
[1:05:51] people he's not looking for bad people
[1:05:54] he's not looking for church order he's
[1:05:58] not looking for message books he's not
[1:06:01] looking for Bibles he's not looking for
[1:06:04] message tapes I'm sorry I'm going too
[1:06:07] fast okay
[1:06:09] what's he looking for he's looking for
[1:06:13] God himself in you and if he does not
[1:06:18] find that out comes the great sword and
[1:06:21] strikes it dead Revelations Tim
[1:06:37] how is the little girl with her teeth oh
[1:06:40] why don't you tell it it's a good time
[1:06:44] to tell it
[1:07:16] wonderful that's right amen amen
[1:07:26] that's God that's God all things are
[1:07:32] yours that was steel or metal of some
[1:07:37] kind in her in her mouth but it belonged
[1:07:39] to me
[1:07:39] it belonged to sister Brooks it belonged
[1:07:42] to that little girl
[1:07:43] why not because we believe the message
[1:07:47] we should believe the message don't I
[1:07:50] please don't take me wrong and what I'm
[1:07:53] saying but believing the message does
[1:07:56] not make all things belong to you that
[1:08:00] metal wire in her mouth belonged to us
[1:08:03] because of our union with Jesus Christ
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:18] revelations 10 verse 8 and the voice
[1:08:28] which I heard from heaven spake unto
[1:08:33] what some next words me who is me
[1:08:40] whoever's reading it so when it says me
[1:08:46] and you're reading it who's he talking
[1:08:48] to you he's talking to you what his
[1:08:51] sister Brooks reading it who's he
[1:08:53] talking to
[1:08:54] he's talking to me whoever's reading
[1:08:56] when he's talking to this lady this lady
[1:08:58] he's talking to you isn't he why because
[1:09:02] this book is a love letter from God to
[1:09:08] who
[1:09:11] that's right is that a love letter to
[1:09:14] this church no then why do we gather at
[1:09:20] church because we want to draw strength
[1:09:28] we want to be able to look at our
[1:09:31] brother and say brother are you fighting
[1:09:33] a battle and help him
[1:09:35] sister likes it what if she had to come
[1:09:38] to church today what if she hadn't said
[1:09:40] well he's hurting too bad let's stay
[1:09:42] home you know what gets me
[1:09:44] it used to be that when God lived in a
[1:09:49] man called William Branham the sick
[1:09:52] people came to church but what happens
[1:09:55] now the sick people stay home what's
[1:10:01] wrong I thought God was the same
[1:10:06] yesterday today and forever we was in
[1:10:11] Ohio and they closed the whole church
[1:10:17] down because the people were sick what
[1:10:26] they can't be serving the same God I'm
[1:10:29] serving because my god he owes I'm sorry
[1:10:35] I don't mean to disrespect those people
[1:10:37] I don't mean that but why don't we come
[1:10:41] with the same thing they had been in the
[1:10:44] days of Peter and the Apostles what they
[1:10:47] do they said come on buddy you're sick
[1:10:49] you're gone look but I don't feel like
[1:10:52] it will carry you we can't get in we'll
[1:10:56] dig a hole in the rough but what do we
[1:11:01] do today oh I better stay home I'm sick
[1:11:15] friends if all you have is coming to
[1:11:17] church you need something more first
[1:11:26] eight revelations ten and the voice
[1:11:29] which I have which I heard from heaven
[1:11:32] spake unto me again I like that little
[1:11:39] part again because that means he had
[1:11:46] already been in contact with God this
[1:11:50] wasn't his first time and thereby when
[1:11:56] God opened that book loosed him seven
[1:12:02] seals and God began to look on that book
[1:12:06] and he began to read somebody's name he
[1:12:12] said oh I see a name here that's still
[1:12:16] on the earth I got to go to the earth
[1:12:18] and give this book to them because this
[1:12:20] belongs to them
[1:12:21] and so God recognized your name on this
[1:12:27] book before you did and God came to you
[1:12:31] and said hey your name is on here
[1:12:34] take it it's yours and everything that's
[1:12:39] in it belongs to you it don't belong to
[1:12:45] God anymore it belongs to you
[1:12:47] because he paid the price for you and
[1:12:52] God says I see your name if God sees
[1:12:59] your name on his book of Redemption and
[1:13:04] he gives you the book and then you make
[1:13:07] a claim God ain't gonna set back and say
[1:13:10] well I hope it works
[1:13:12] no God's gonna say come here all you
[1:13:16] angels come here are you terrible's come
[1:13:19] on we got some work to do this ain't the
[1:13:23] seventh day
[1:13:27] got ain't good working oh no God still
[1:13:32] working and so when you make a claim
[1:13:37] based on the Word of God and stand there
[1:13:41] and say god I see my name in this book
[1:13:46] you gave this title to me and because
[1:13:50] you gave that to me I make a claim about
[1:13:53] my brother who stood out there and look
[1:13:57] like his blaspheme what does God say
[1:13:59] what is your judgment upon your brother
[1:14:03] what does the scripture say either
[1:14:06] accusing or excusing one another that's
[1:14:14] you are you accusing your brethren or
[1:14:17] are you excusing your brethren so God
[1:14:21] says to you what do you decide about
[1:14:24] your brother it's up to you and he waits
[1:14:33] for your decision
[1:14:37] now look
[1:14:47] when you make your decision on what's
[1:14:51] going to happen you've made a decision
[1:14:55] on your children and God says to Satan
[1:14:59] Satan I want you to prove to her that
[1:15:04] she's right
[1:15:06] Satan don't come to do Satan's will
[1:15:09] Satan can only do God's will in this
[1:15:13] circumstance because God has revealed to
[1:15:16] you what will happen with your children
[1:15:18] and therefore you speak thus saith the
[1:15:21] Lord then God says I want her to be
[1:15:25] completely strong and steadfast so
[1:15:29] therefore because all is hurt
[1:15:31] Satan is hers also I command you Satan
[1:15:35] to go help her and strengthen her so
[1:15:39] what does Satan do he cast every storm
[1:15:41] he can against her he cast every doubt
[1:15:47] that he can against her why because God
[1:15:50] is making her style oh we look at it so
[1:15:56] wrong we look at and say oh god please
[1:15:59] take this away God says I'm just helping
[1:16:03] you how bad did it look on him three
[1:16:10] Hebrew children he looked pretty bad let
[1:16:15] me ask you something when them three
[1:16:19] Hebrew children were bound and their
[1:16:21] guards were pushing them to the fire and
[1:16:23] the fire killed their guards why did
[1:16:28] they keep walking would you would you
[1:16:36] stop and say hey I don't have to go in
[1:16:38] there they're dead no they kept walking
[1:16:43] they walked right in their guards wasn't
[1:16:49] the one doing it their God was the one
[1:16:53] that was doing it they were just
[1:16:56] following him
[1:17:00] did they find their God when their
[1:17:02] guards died nope did they find their God
[1:17:07] when the King made the great decree nope
[1:17:11] did they find their God when they said
[1:17:13] whether he keeps us or not we don't care
[1:17:17] no they didn't find their God then but
[1:17:20] they found him at the absolute worst
[1:17:23] time that there was and so will you you
[1:17:32] won't find him when the ways are easy we
[1:17:35] don't look for him when things are going
[1:17:38] so good did we pray very much what did
[1:17:47] David say he said I follow the Lord then
[1:17:52] I get cold and I fall away and God picks
[1:17:57] me up again and I serve him awhile then
[1:18:00] I get cold and I fall again and he picks
[1:18:05] me up and I serve God a while then I get
[1:18:08] cold and I fall again and he picks me up
[1:18:11] again
[1:18:12] we're the same way but all belongs to
[1:18:20] you all belongs to you let me say again
[1:18:27] not because you believe the message that
[1:18:33] does not bring all to you what brings
[1:18:37] all to you is your union with Jesus
[1:18:40] Christ now let's read again 1st
[1:18:46] Corinthians chapter 3
[1:19:02] 21 therefore let no man glory in men for
[1:19:12] all things are yours whether Paul first
[1:19:22] church age messenger now let me say this
[1:19:26] or brother branham the seventh church
[1:19:30] age messenger it belongs to you or a
[1:19:36] palace who's a missionary who's an
[1:19:39] apostle I am you have to know your
[1:19:44] calling in God or you ain't gonna be
[1:19:45] much good when we were little kids you
[1:19:48] know we try and run around we all as we
[1:19:50] were little kids and we heard how
[1:19:52] brother branham spoke them squirrels
[1:19:53] into existence we'd run out in the words
[1:19:55] that there be a squirrel why we was
[1:19:58] trying to be like him
[1:19:59] we wanted to be like him we didn't know
[1:20:02] what we was but that was our hero we
[1:20:06] wanted to be like he did so surely God
[1:20:08] would hear us but he did but once we
[1:20:13] grew up we had to know our calling you
[1:20:17] have to be able to go through this and
[1:20:20] say that scripture is mine
[1:20:23] that's good two stalks of meat you find
[1:20:28] another scoot all that scripture talks
[1:20:29] of me it don't matter if you're called
[1:20:31] to the ministry or not you've got to
[1:20:33] know where your place is in the Word of
[1:20:35] God I lost my place
[1:20:40] 1st Corinthians 3 whether it be Paul the
[1:20:48] messenger or a palace a great apostle or
[1:20:52] Cephas a great apostle said don't glory
[1:20:57] in men or the world whatever if it's in
[1:21:05] the world now
[1:21:11] this has been open and it's in the world
[1:21:17] today and if you have been in that union
[1:21:21] with Jesus Christ it belongs to you
[1:21:25] if all you have done is believed that
[1:21:28] this is opened come to Jesus Christ come
[1:21:37] to him and let him let him give this
[1:21:45] book to you he's the original owner I I
[1:21:51] can't give it to you brother Branham
[1:21:55] couldn't give it to you each man had to
[1:22:00] go for themselves now why did brother
[1:22:03] Branham say he said no group is getting
[1:22:08] their own revelation and no individual
[1:22:12] is getting a private revelation they are
[1:22:16] all getting a revelation that has
[1:22:18] already been given by way of the
[1:22:21] messenger it isn't the messenger that's
[1:22:25] given you the revelation it's God that's
[1:22:28] giving you the revelation that he gave
[1:22:29] to the messenger you can't say well I
[1:22:34] believe the messenger that's not a union
[1:22:37] with Jesus Christ you've got to come to
[1:22:40] Jesus Christ that's why we've got so
[1:22:44] much failings going on in the message
[1:22:46] churches that's why we've got so much
[1:22:49] division in the message churches is
[1:22:51] because it's nothing but a message we've
[1:22:56] taken Christ out of it and made our own
[1:22:59] message what does the scripture say if I
[1:23:04] be lifted up from the earth I will draw
[1:23:10] all men to me not if the message be
[1:23:14] lifted up from the earth friends I
[1:23:21] listen to a message about a month ago
[1:23:23] preached by a great message preacher and
[1:23:31] this message preacher said these words
[1:23:33] he said if you believe that our
[1:23:38] profession I didn't want appreciation 1
[1:23:42] so I had to look it up it means one who
[1:23:45] stands in your place one who takes your
[1:23:48] sins this man message preacher he said
[1:23:55] if you believe that our perpetuation is
[1:23:59] Jesus Christ of two thousand years ago
[1:24:02] you are sadly mistaken and he went on to
[1:24:09] say this message is our profession my
[1:24:16] friends that's a lie
[1:24:20] there's only one propitiation that's
[1:24:24] that bleeding bloody lamb the one who
[1:24:28] came and tucked the book and opened the
[1:24:32] seals now friends this wasn't preached a
[1:24:37] couple years ago this was preached by a
[1:24:41] man who walked with William Branham he's
[1:24:46] one of the greatest message preachers
[1:24:49] there is in the world his known world
[1:24:53] around his messages go world around and
[1:24:57] it was preached in 1988 and he hasn't
[1:25:03] changed it since but yet he has called
[1:25:11] the greatest leader in the message can
[1:25:17] you see why
[1:25:17] Jesus Christ is not in the message
[1:25:19] churches because they've rejected him as
[1:25:23] our propitiated and replaced it with
[1:25:28] something else who cannot replace Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ if you replace Jesus Christ
[1:25:35] whatever you replace him with makes you
[1:25:38] Antichrist
[1:25:51] Jesus Christ our union with him makes
[1:25:59] you possessor of all things no you say
[1:26:08] is there a way to know if you've been in
[1:26:13] this union with Jesus Christ that's a
[1:26:16] good question because anybody can make
[1:26:20] that claim or the random said what the
[1:26:30] Spirit says the Prophet says and what
[1:26:35] the Spirit says through the Prophet the
[1:26:37] bride will be saying the same thing and
[1:26:40] he said what they will be saying is this
[1:26:47] come out of her my people if all were
[1:26:53] saying is come to a message church we're
[1:26:56] not saying what the Prophet said I
[1:27:03] listen to the quote this morning brother
[1:27:06] Branham said he was preaching the
[1:27:10] message called God God's chosen place of
[1:27:13] worship and he said friends I am
[1:27:18] responsible for a message and he said
[1:27:25] that message is this come out of this
[1:27:31] mess and if I'm telling you to come out
[1:27:37] I have to take you somewhere this is
[1:27:41] still what he said and he said where am
[1:27:46] I going to take you he said well I take
[1:27:50] you to the Branham Tabernacle he said
[1:27:55] it's just as bad as any of them that was
[1:28:02] his chart
[1:28:06] he said where can I take you Jesus
[1:28:12] Christ we've taken the phrase where he
[1:28:16] said this message is Christ and we've
[1:28:18] made it Antichrist Jesus Christ came
[1:28:24] back with the open book
[1:28:26] that's the message but we've made a
[1:28:29] bunch of doctrines and creeds and laws
[1:28:32] and said that's Christ that isn't Christ
[1:28:38] it's the bleeding bloody land
[1:28:54] where do you stand where do I stand
[1:29:10] in the days in the Garden of Eden
[1:29:13] brother Brahim said we're back in that
[1:29:15] day again the same temptation that
[1:29:22] tempted Eve is in the land today the
[1:29:27] same temptation
[1:29:29] what was that temptation when Satan gave
[1:29:36] Eve knowledge of God's Word the same
[1:29:45] temptation today the temptation today
[1:29:51] Satan will give you knowledge of this
[1:29:54] message but you have to give him
[1:29:59] something you have to reject the Holy
[1:30:05] Ghost and once you reject the Holy Ghost
[1:30:12] what do you get the mark of the beast
[1:30:18] but you get knowledge of this message
[1:30:23] God's not looking for knowledge of this
[1:30:26] message God's looking for his life in
[1:30:37] you in you and me he's not looking for a
[1:30:45] church he's not looking for a group he's
[1:30:52] looking for his bride and his bride
[1:30:58] there was many beautiful girls in the
[1:31:01] days of Joseph but the great king made a
[1:31:06] decree and said that one might be pretty
[1:31:10] over there that one might be pretty over
[1:31:12] there but this is the one that's Mary
[1:31:15] and Joseph
[1:31:23] and a little lady it was probably a
[1:31:28] couple of times he thought I don't want
[1:31:30] this uh that's a lot of responsibility
[1:31:37] but you know what it wasn't because all
[1:31:42] the responsibility that she thought she
[1:31:46] had was on him it was nothing on her
[1:31:54] there was not one person in the whole
[1:31:57] land of Egypt that could come up to her
[1:32:00] and say listen lady you're gonna answer
[1:32:01] for that
[1:32:02] not one person could do that not one not
[1:32:08] even the great king because he didn't
[1:32:13] have rule over her she belonged to him
[1:32:16] she belonged to Joseph if he wanted her
[1:32:20] to ask for something he had to go to
[1:32:21] Joseph and Joseph would say honey come
[1:32:25] here come here baby
[1:32:28] let's talk how many times has Jesus
[1:32:36] Christ done that to you when we deserved
[1:32:39] a good thump we deserved a good beating
[1:32:46] and we knew it we hang our head oh I'm
[1:32:54] so sorry what would he do come down
[1:33:00] there with his little nail-scarred hand
[1:33:03] but around her shoulders it draws close
[1:33:05] and say your forgive her and not make it
[1:33:09] worse than if he punished us you know
[1:33:14] has that ever happened to you I think
[1:33:22] it'll happen again but let me say to you
[1:33:28] today as we stand to our feet
[1:33:44] if you have never had that voice from
[1:33:48] heaven speak directly to you and say you
[1:33:59] go take that book I'm not talking about
[1:34:05] a good feeling I'm not talking about
[1:34:10] thinking well it probably belongs to me
[1:34:15] or standing up in emotion but when the
[1:34:22] mighty God comes to you and says this is
[1:34:31] yours not the preacher
[1:34:40] but God
[1:34:45] if you've never had that it's because
[1:34:49] you've never had a union with Jesus
[1:34:51] Christ and you can have that God will
[1:35:00] not call God will not take this book to
[1:35:03] someone who is not part of Christ he
[1:35:11] can't
[1:35:18] but if God is calling in your heart
[1:35:22] right now right now some thing that's
[1:35:29] just like that's almost you're afraid to
[1:35:34] breathe because you know something's
[1:35:38] here and like baby was talking to me
[1:35:41] what is this what is this it's God
[1:35:46] calling for you it's God saying I want
[1:35:51] you to be part of me I want you to have
[1:35:56] this union it isn't you reaching out to
[1:36:00] God it's God reaching out to you as we
[1:36:08] bow our heads
[1:36:55] if you are in that little voice in your
[1:36:58] heart
[1:37:04] that God wants you would you accept
[1:37:13] would you just slip your hand up to him
[1:37:15] and say god I feel your call and me
[1:37:52] oh Jesus once again your mercy has come
[1:38:03] we look we see that great mercy seat
[1:38:09] were you laid for those two thousand
[1:38:12] years is empty
[1:38:23] and there's no mercy to look upon up
[1:38:28] there anymore
[1:38:31] but down here where you are act the
[1:38:35] mercy is many times greater than it was
[1:38:43] and God there was hands that was raised
[1:38:46] to you tonight hands that answered the
[1:38:52] call that you gave to each heart
[1:39:03] they raised that hand to you like that
[1:39:04] little ice on earth raised to Joseph
[1:39:08] that's a Joseph though my father was a
[1:39:13] great priest and well honored I follow
[1:39:19] you your ways are my ways I no longer
[1:39:28] follow in my desires but I follow in
[1:39:33] yours oh God thank you that your mercy
[1:39:39] is so great and I ask you O God to
[1:39:44] vindicate to each one that raised their
[1:39:47] hand Lord
[1:39:49] come to them in that way bring this open
[1:39:53] book to them Lord that God they can
[1:39:56] realize that all belongs to them that
[1:40:04] there is nothing
[1:40:05] whether it be in principalities or
[1:40:08] messengers or preachers or worlds or
[1:40:11] lives or deaths or things present or
[1:40:15] things to come that it all belongs to us
[1:40:32] Thank You O God for that great mercy
[1:40:46] and the name of Jesus Christ Amy
[1:40:58] there is a fountain filled with blood
[1:41:03] drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners
[1:41:08] plunged beneath that flood lose all
[1:41:12] their guilty State you who raised your
[1:41:18] hand a few moments ago you still belong
[1:41:23] to that religion to that church but
[1:41:28] because you see God I accept you I
[1:41:33] accept that bloody lamb then not only
[1:41:37] was slain back there but slain before
[1:41:40] the foundation of the world and he came
[1:41:42] forth in time and he took that book the
[1:41:45] same land
[1:41:47] that same lamp came to the earth in a
[1:41:51] spirit form and he came to you tonight
[1:41:58] and he changed
[1:42:03] because I preached the message no
[1:42:07] because he came I could preach from now
[1:42:12] for the rest of my days it wouldn't
[1:42:14] change nothing but if he comes one tiny
[1:42:18] bit it changes everything and to you
[1:42:32] was had that union with Jesus Christ you
[1:42:36] who've been discouraged and down and we
[1:42:43] God is asking you tonight
[1:42:46] in your weakness because it's in your
[1:42:50] weakness that he has made strong he's
[1:42:53] asking you tonight what would you have
[1:42:56] me to do
[1:42:59] it's got a servant
[1:43:05] has got a man that he can be commanded
[1:43:07] no but he is a husband and it's his
[1:43:17] desire to know what your desire is and
[1:43:20] if you can stand upon this principle the
[1:43:26] Word of God and stand there
[1:43:31] steadfast what you say will be all
[1:43:39] things are yours what was the prophet
[1:43:46] brought for in this day to restore the
[1:43:48] faith that is it yours does it feel like
[1:43:54] it's yours no that's not faith faith
[1:44:00] isn't based on feelings faith isn't
[1:44:04] based on this
[1:44:06] faith isn't based on this faith is based
[1:44:11] on love and forgiveness
[1:44:19] so that they can reach out in this word
[1:44:23] anything that's in here and say God I
[1:44:27] have need of this I desire this and God
[1:44:32] says yes and then it will be
[1:44:45] I told brother Isaac before the service
[1:44:49] I'm sure some of you have heard this
[1:44:51] testimony I hate to keep making you
[1:44:54] stand but it somehow feel led to do this
[1:44:57] there was a lady back in the six 1960s
[1:45:06] her and her husband had gone to
[1:45:09] California to meet with brother Branham
[1:45:12] in a meeting and when they got there to
[1:45:17] California they met several others that
[1:45:19] had come for that purpose not to hearing
[1:45:23] preach but to simply have their needs
[1:45:27] met by God and they all discussed their
[1:45:32] situations so each of them knew the
[1:45:35] other ones situations and in the meeting
[1:45:39] brother Branham called every one of them
[1:45:42] and told every one of them their
[1:45:46] situation and when he called this
[1:45:49] woman's husband told her exactly his
[1:45:52] situation he said and your wife who is
[1:45:58] barren shall have a son about this time
[1:46:02] next year they left the man was healed
[1:46:07] all the other ones were healed when they
[1:46:11] got home the woman went to the radio
[1:46:15] station and she got on live radio
[1:46:19] and declared william branham a false
[1:46:22] prophet even though she was pregnant
[1:46:25] hadn't been pregnant before she put it
[1:46:29] in the newspapers that william branham
[1:46:31] was leading people against christ and
[1:46:35] she convinced her neighbors to turn
[1:46:38] against william branham she had the baby
[1:46:41] and she still was telling people that
[1:46:46] william branham was a false prophet it's
[1:46:51] pretty serious the baby grew up to about
[1:46:58] eight months old and it got sick its
[1:47:03] boughs twisted inside the father called
[1:47:10] brother Branham told him the situation
[1:47:14] told him everything didn't tell him
[1:47:17] about his wife told him that he had been
[1:47:19] called out that his wife would have a
[1:47:21] baby and she had the baby but the baby
[1:47:27] was dying and brother Branham said to
[1:47:32] the man sir can I speak to your wife and
[1:47:39] he gave the phone to his wife and
[1:47:42] immediately his wife started to cry and
[1:47:46] she said brother Branham I've blaspheme
[1:47:50] he said all sister you've not blaspheme
[1:47:53] he said yes I have she said you don't
[1:47:58] know what I've done she said I've went
[1:48:00] on the radio I went in the newspaper
[1:48:02] I've convinced churches I've convinced
[1:48:05] people you're a false prophet
[1:48:07] he said old sister you haven't blaspheme
[1:48:11] see some but I have he said you take
[1:48:16] that dishrag you're holding in your hand
[1:48:18] and you go put it on that baby
[1:48:21] and let's see if you've blaspheme she
[1:48:28] took the dishrag and she walked to the
[1:48:31] baby put the
[1:48:33] his rag on the baby and immediately the
[1:48:35] boughs unwound and I had a bowel
[1:48:37] movement
[1:48:38] did she blaspheme she probably did but
[1:48:45] it was the mercy of God through that
[1:48:48] prophet that took that blaspheming away
[1:49:02] will God do the same for you are you
[1:49:07] greater than the Prophet yes because he
[1:49:13] belongs to you you are the bride of
[1:49:18] Jesus Christ he was the messenger from
[1:49:21] Jesus Christ to you not trying to put
[1:49:26] him down but putting you where you
[1:49:29] belong
[1:49:33] as far as messengers there was no
[1:49:38] greater but as far as the Bride of
[1:49:42] Christ there is no greater either you
[1:49:45] belong to Jesus Christ what is your
[1:49:51] judgment what do you say about the one
[1:49:57] who sins against you do you condemn him
[1:50:04] or do you say God please don't hold it
[1:50:08] to their charge yes they deserve
[1:50:11] punishment they deserve to go to hell
[1:50:14] but so did I and you forgave me God will
[1:50:20] you forgive them also
[1:50:29] the great prophet Moses stood before God
[1:50:36] one day and there was a people that God
[1:50:42] had already cursed and he told Moses he
[1:50:49] said come here I'm gonna kill them all
[1:50:52] they're dead Moses said to God God take
[1:51:01] my name off of your book and leave
[1:51:05] theirs on would you do that would you do
[1:51:13] that to your hurt to a person that God
[1:51:19] has already cursed and stricken away
[1:51:22] from him and yet Moses because Christ
[1:51:27] was in his heart he said God you take my
[1:51:32] name off of the book he knew what that
[1:51:36] meant he knew if his name was taken off
[1:51:42] that book it was over can you do the
[1:51:48] same
[1:51:53] was Christ in Moses isn't the same
[1:51:56] Christ in you if it was Christ in Moses
[1:52:00] under the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:52:03] now it's literally Christ the life in
[1:52:06] you what will it do today
[1:52:24] let me say
[1:52:33] well you from this day forward
[1:52:37] every person that's here will you from
[1:52:41] this day forward instead of revealing
[1:52:44] your brother or your sister will you
[1:52:48] lift them up and hold them up in prayer
[1:52:51] and if they have done wrong will you
[1:52:57] throw yourself in their place and say
[1:53:00] God punish me instead could you do that
[1:53:08] without Christ no we can't but I can do
[1:53:14] all things through Christ who
[1:53:16] strengthens me will you do that will you
[1:53:24] raise your hand and say god I raised my
[1:53:26] hand please help me hold God from this
[1:53:31] day forth I can let the love of God
[1:53:34] shine so forth in me that when I see a
[1:53:37] brother I see his sister stumble and
[1:53:39] fall that old God I will raise them up
[1:53:42] and help them back on the path Lord that
[1:53:45] old God I can reach down to the lowest
[1:53:48] pits they pull them up on the straight
[1:53:53] and narrow trail again Lord
[1:53:55] Oh God strike out of our hearts any
[1:54:00] bitterness any anger jealousy Lord and
[1:54:06] old God may that true love of God come
[1:54:09] forth into each of our hearts Lord God
[1:54:15] we will no longer say I'm a church I'm
[1:54:17] part of a church and I'm part of Christ
[1:54:24] and make her stand in that great king
[1:54:40] let's sing that song Amazing Grace how
[1:54:44] sweet the sound army zing grace how
[1:54:58] sweet I'd say me I was lost but now I'm
[1:55:21] found was blind but now I see Joe's
[1:55:35] grace that taught my heart to fear and
[1:55:45] grace my fears read
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:56] our ranchers need that grace appear the
[1:56:07] hour I first hear is something changing
[1:56:22] here you can't change that only God can
[1:56:30] change that remember sister Ruby them
[1:56:34] years ago when you'd pray and that
[1:56:37] didn't matter how tired you was that did
[1:56:39] it
[1:56:40] something came on didn't it's that same
[1:56:43] on he never left
[1:56:56] us some of our young people raised their
[1:57:02] hand because God was dealing with them
[1:57:08] brother Branham said Satan three times
[1:57:12] in history targeted young people once in
[1:57:17] the days of Moses he killed children two
[1:57:23] years down once in the days of Jesus he
[1:57:28] killed children two years down and he
[1:57:32] said and now today he started targeting
[1:57:35] young people that's you that's these
[1:57:41] young people here that's his young man
[1:57:43] here
[1:57:44] Satan is targeting them especially them
[1:57:50] why because they're the next generation
[1:57:56] so if you find time to pray pray for
[1:58:01] these young people Satan will hit him
[1:58:05] with everything he's got everything
[1:58:22] do you love the Lord hate me does
[1:58:28] anybody need prayer for anything
[1:58:31] I'm glad brother Troy mated today with
[1:58:34] service there in Iowa City is that the
[1:58:38] family is alright and had problems
[1:58:45] wonderful wonderful I do have one
[1:58:49] request I would like to make known
[1:58:51] brother a friend of mine he was a
[1:58:56] Spanish man from Mexico and he when he
[1:59:02] came to the Lord he had a knife that he
[1:59:04] was going to kill me with and the Lord
[1:59:08] the Lord saved me and saved him to you
[1:59:11] and so I thank the Lord for that but
[1:59:16] tomorrow at one o'clock he's to go to
[1:59:19] court to see if they will ship make him
[1:59:21] go back to Mexico or be able to stay
[1:59:24] here and so keep him in your prayers
[1:59:27] it's a very rough man a very rough man
[1:59:31] and but now he's a child of God and so
[1:59:37] we if you remember his name is Ezekiel I
[1:59:41] don't know what it is in Spanish
[1:59:43] Chucky or something like that but if you
[1:59:47] could remember to please pray for him
[1:59:49] he's he said he doesn't if they send him
[1:59:53] back to Mexico that would be fine but if
[1:59:57] they send him back he has to go back to
[1:59:59] the very place where he was the drug
[2:00:01] King in that area and so he don't want
[2:00:05] to go back to that but maybe God wants
[2:00:09] him to go back to that I don't know but
[2:00:14] I told him I said brother Ezekiel if God
[2:00:17] wants you there that's the best place
[2:00:19] you can be
[2:00:21] so keep
[2:00:22] in your prayers not that God keeps him
[2:00:24] from there but that God puts him where
[2:00:28] God wants him to be maybe one of us who
[2:00:37] was never caught up in those drugs and
[2:00:40] those kinds of things and murders and we
[2:00:45] might not be able to testify to those
[2:00:46] kinds of people but he can because he's
[2:00:51] changed God came and changed him so even
[2:00:57] though it looks dark to him it's the
[2:01:00] best place he can be if that's where God
[2:01:02] wants him so let's pray that God's will
[2:01:05] be done
[2:01:05] for further Ezekiel sister Sarah rather
[2:01:11] Isaac's sister has fallen away from the
[2:01:15] Lord but God is calling her back let's
[2:01:21] keep her in prayer and each other each
[2:01:26] other let's keep each other in prayer
[2:01:34] may God bless each one of you I count
[2:01:39] each one a very dear friend brother and
[2:01:43] sister in Christ each one I may not know
[2:01:47] each one but I know him and you know him
[2:01:50] and he knows you and he knows me I count
[2:01:55] each of you as a dear I see the brother
[2:01:58] back there with the great testimony of
[2:01:59] his heart only being 1/4 of his heart
[2:02:01] working and God still using him that's
[2:02:05] wonderful 75 years old god bless you
[2:02:09] brother the brother in the back god

[2:02:13] that you've made over the years for this
[2:02:15] brother here losing his wife yes still
[2:02:18] standing so strongly each one has a
[2:02:22] great testimony and I wish I knew each
[2:02:24] one that I could tell I don't
[2:02:27] but God does God does I will say this
[2:02:31] the greatest testimony that could ever
[2:02:34] be told happened here tonight but these
[2:02:38] young ladies raised in their hand to
[2:02:40] Jesus Christ with these people saying
[2:02:43] god I've had a religion I've had a
[2:02:46] church but I haven't had you that's the
[2:02:50] greatest testimony there is that's the
[2:02:53] greatest why because even if God heals
[2:02:57] us if time goes on they'll come a time

[2:03:04] with Christ
