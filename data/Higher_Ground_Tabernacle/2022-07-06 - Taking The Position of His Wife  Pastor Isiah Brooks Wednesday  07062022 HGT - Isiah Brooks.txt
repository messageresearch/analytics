have it i can't explain it is yes thank you jesus in my soul yes i speak to jesus in my soul yes i've got that's why i can say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah bring it in my soul a little bit too loud now god is good to us and we thank the lord for his grace and his mercy before i get into the word of god we very seldom announce this little magazine that is sent to us periodically and i think it comes from well the eddie biscuits church but from the brother brother tim dodd is one that makes sure he gets out and go through but it's always a fascinating magazine and and i think sometime they ask for donations they don't ask but if you ever feel like sending because there is a great work they do behind this is to be a little missionary work that you can do because they go to different places and on this one it says a revival unexpected revival in uganda those are the good kind amen so if you we have some more magazines back there if you like to look at them also for those who are adults who have children and they've been thinking about homeschooling we know that they have a home schooling program there and you can check into what it's all about and maybe you might find an interest in it especially if you have little ones that needs to be homeschooled we know by god's grace that uh things are getting so bad in the public schools that uh it makes us want to just leave the earth but by god's grace we've got to stay here until jesus is ready and prepared for us glad to see everybody here tonight amen as we stand we're going to come from uh two passages of scripture we thank our musicians uh for playing for us i believe by god's grace in the song leader we appreciate everyone that participate even those who are in the audience it really means a lot when you get behind the song leader and sing and not sing to your neighbor but saying to to god that that that one song i don't know what you come to do you know and it says i didn't come to look at you i came to praise the lord that's right we don't come to look at each other we come to praise the lord we love the lord we like to come from revelations to 19th chapter for those of you who were here during the time of our brother isaiah bowa's ministry uh that was absolutely wonderful and i felt conviction in my soul i teared up i mean everything that was said was truth the only disappointment that i did have is that i didn't see the altar and i trust fool i i trust that your altar was your heart because my how can you hear the voice of god and that's what that was that was not isaiah that was actually the voice of god visiting this little assembly and i thought oh my god what a real blessing that god will find time to visit us but what a disgrace if we didn't hear and see that that was the voice of god and not the voice of a man it's not always easy to minister in that way you have to really put move yourself out of the way to hear the voice i heard it and i repented revelations 19 beginning at the seventh verse let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus christ worship god for the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy one more scripture first peter 2. first peter 2. we have had many sermons messages and maybe i'm just in a position where i can hear and feel uh messages easier now than i used to be able to i know all of the young ministers have brought tremendous messages and they all have fed the church and i appreciate everyone that has come up behind the pulpit and and have allowed themselves to be used by god i just thought that i would point this one out from isaiah because when i heard it it was it was my heart's cry and so anyway i trust that you will understand we're not preferring anyone we're just thanking god for being able to hear the voice of god through his lips the ninth verse second first peter second chapter but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation that's the part i think many people miss they love the generation they love the royal priesthood but they forget the holy nation a peculiar people and that doesn't mean you make yourself peculiar but because of the holy ghost in you you appear to be peculiar to the world that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul having your conversations honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may buy your good works which they shall be hold glorify god in the day of visitation it goes right back to our brother speaking on being a billboard let us pray father we so thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and your mercy you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves we thank you for your habitation abiding in us and allowing us to abide in you god the union in which you have given unto us cannot be broken but there is things that you are expecting uh of us and these great things only come by yielding to your voice yielding to your word yielding to your holy spirit and i pray lord tonight that you would grant these things that the world and all of our associates and friends may see jesus in us be kind and merciful to us dear god give us the grace to humble ourselves to completely die out to our will that your will be done in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated first of all we know that we come in an aged age that we must be tried tribulations trials these things come they must come you can't be perfected without them your gold tried in the fire and according to the seven church age the prophet of god says seven golden candlesticks in exodus 2 25 25 31 it says and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold a beaten work shall the candlesticks be made his shaft and his branches his bows his knobs his flowers shall be the same the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold in saying this he's saying you must be beaten you must be formed you must be shaped out of the same substance that he was made from her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest y'all hear that these are these words are not written for poetry these words are written because they are to live what he has she is to what manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i just interjected that there is no fault in her she is all glorious within now reading that you you you would probably think to yourself how can that ever be but you must understand that is the duty of the church or the bride is to reflect jesus christ to the world in the absence of the son of god and we should all believe that amen and the duties as i said is to reflect the lord jesus christ in every way now you and i say well by god's grace how can that possibly be first of all the word has spoken she is all glorious within and without from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her lord did you hear that she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god the whole entire bible has been wrapped around or expressed about you everything god has done and displayed from the old to the new testament you and i have uh have been chosen to be the epitome of of his creation amen we can't keep slacking amen god is calling for repentance and you know it all depends on how bad you want it he says how can one fathom it we can't how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god has spoken it and this is what he's saying see what we fail to do is take the word by faith by revelation that's me claim it to be you even when you can't see it with your natural eyes but by faith your revelation will produce it the revelation in which god is given the bride today is beyond comprehension it can't be perceived in the intellect it has to be in the heart the lukewarm condition of the church is because there is a lack of prayer i'm not leaving prayer because i realize that's what it is brother say get away from this old lukewarm halfway say a little prayer of a morning a little prayer at night and go to bed and get up the next morning no wonder we're getting worldly no wonder the world's creeping into the church because we don't stay in prayer there's no more agonizing what lord knows we need to learn once again how to agonize in prayer no more agonizing there's no more staying before god there's no more digging out and cleaning up and that's the problem god can't bless the hypocrisies and the things that we're we're living don't listen i'm not here to condemn anybody we're trying to shine the light on sin and when we see ourselves don't run just say lord it's me standing in the need of prayer before god there's no more digging out cleaning up we need an old-fashioned revival we just pull ourselves we're we're with assemblies we're the pentecost we're the ones we're the trinity we're this that or the other we don't have nothing to do with that other group see see that that's it i keep expressing the bride is not denominational she can't be an organization she must be free and that me that freedom means she must love all you may not have to agree with everything but you got to love all that's where the holy spirit leaves you right there yeah when you think you're better than somebody else god has gone he's left you this is why so many churches are dead now because they think like the pharisees if you don't have this you're out of it and how deceived they are god has children everywhere and who are we to say who is and who is not because we don't know what the end of the day is going to look like but i know one thing he said he'll never lose one there's where the holy ghost leaves you right there when you get that in your mind brother you just might as well go back to the altar because that's the place you belong that's right amen that's how worldly creeps willingness creeps in let's forget about it let's put our affection on christ and look to christ and him alone amen having fellowship one with another while the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin if he could if he would come to mark today every one of us without a fault who would he mark if you think the next man's in error remember the grace of god just as well just as real to him as it is to you right i hate for him to mark me today whether i was faultless or not i don't trust in that i trust in the grace of the lord jesus christ to take me through i stand in his grace alone nothing in my arms i bring i've i've done nothing i've said nothing that's worth nothing there's not a thing that i've done lord i just wholly depend on you just you and you alone sure lord and if i love you with a true heart i'll certainly love you and walk and try my best not to do nothing to hurt you and if i do anything to hurt you you're wrong i repent for it's as quick as i do as i do it see but today you can preach repentance and hell fire brimstone and people will laugh at it i mean come on we've had some tough messages here we've had some things said and you think people would repent there would be a real godly sorrow and their desperation no the matter our hearts are cold we're indifferent we got too much we need less of the world and more of god our hearts are too cold we become interested in some emotion we come interested if we can dance if we can shout i believe in it if we can speak the tongues i believe in it i believe in every bit of that but if we have that and don't have the agonizing weeping broken up spirit god could never use it them things are good but we've got to have the other to go with it we've left off the main thing and gone uh for secondarily and you can never major on a minor we know that even in our own meetings our own meetings we have too much to the to to the place there's too much on divine healing instead of healing of the soul brother what we need today is a revival of breaking up souls of on fire for god what i mean on fire is down at the altar with tears running down your cheeks not for five minutes and get up and forget but out out trying to win the loss back to christ again a burden on their heart what a joy it is and a privilege to serve god give it to these young people lord they've got an awful battle look at them look at what they've got look at their television rotten and polluted look at the nation that they're coming up in here lord politics rotten to the core antichrist arising in seats in power the world america people don't know what a struggle is they don't know how to to to to do without they never had to miss a meal oh god just look glam in hollywood and it's even got into a assembly line religion in the churches in streamline hollywood no more old-fashioned all-night prayer meetings and agonizing and praying and having fellowship around the things of god no more praying through [Music] it's true no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word see that's what we need to be doing lord i know what your words say is supposed to be in this hour and we need to just i'm talking from the pulpit to the back of the door we need to get on our knees and agonize like lord i know it's supposed to be and i'm not going to stop knocking until i see it happening no more believing the true word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulturize down a denomination put their names on the book got lazy and saw set back there gloating on some kind of a dead of a carrion and then supposed to be at lea least a hawk that's a similar brother to the ego the prophet that brought the word through through the word and manifested now you and i must understand that if we don't move and when i say that is that brother man preach the message on acting on the words you have heard it not just walking out and forgetting you know what you heard but and listen it's a battle you've got a lot of evil forces against you and satan don't want you to pray he'll do everything he'll let you read your bible he'll let you listen to a message tape but when it comes down to prayer he's going to fight you because he knows if you cry out to god he's going to answer and then god is going to reveal to you the things that you're lacking he's going to also reveal to you how to overcome he's going to reveal to you who you really are satan i want you to know who you really are huh we got to take our position we are the bride there is there there's no more coming after us there's no more church jesus or anything this is it somebody got to fight for it i like the way that brother said many people have died for the world all kinds of things have happened to the people before us and then we think that we've got a right to be lazy may god help us like i said i had to repent myself we've done we've got too many things in the fire the things what we need to be doing we're not doing and satan is just laughing because he thinks he's got you think thinking you're prospering no no no somebody said something to me today and i said to him i said you know my greatest concern is that i prosper in god that's what i told him i don't care about all this other stuff we need to take and i got taking a trip into the heavenlies crossing into another dimension and i guarantee you most of us don't even know what i'm talking about but i want you to understand there is a level of prayer that changes you it transports you into a place where visions break you don't believe it i said last week or the last time i spoke i spoke on that little woman who cried out lord where is your elijah and she said god spoke to her she saw him coming she says i saw you coming she had prayed so much till she entered into an another dimension of time she saw it before it happened so much so it was in detail he asked she asked him where is your little briefcase see so god is perfect folks we you say well lord i i just don't know who what tomorrow brings he brings it if we ever get to a place where we could really get down into prayer and you know put like they said you know pull the stomach back sometime it's true i never believed or understood how the the bible said that we make our bellies our god and we're it's true in this day we're more concerned about the natural foods and feeling the belly than we are concerned about the spiritual and it's true we worship it we bow to it we need to get into the shekinah this is our goal to get into the shekinah glory we're not here to stay in the courts in the church ages you know you know the candlesticks and all that that's all good but there's a higher level to this message we can't go back and preach pentecost it's already been preached the bride has a message and her message is to go forward to enter into the veil amen and the entering into the veil you must bring you know how can i say wear the garment of a priest and the garment of the priest is jesus christ himself put on the whole arm of god is that right add your faith virtue that's it oh no one clean will be able to go back there unless you're covered by the blood he said but once he once walked into the holies of holies walked into the presence of god and the veil falls behind him there's a part of a manner where he can eat every day every hour of the week in other words you never run out of revelation god is always breaking good stuff to you you're feasting on foods that nobody else is feasting on that's why you when god gives you a great revelation sometimes you say you try to show up with a brother he can't understand what you see he's not in that position to see it god is taking you to another another level let's not back up it's time to go forward help us jesus we need to take our position by our husband the bible said the bride has made his wife has made herself ready amen amen a royal priesthood the word stands for you you need to stand for the word the word speaks your existence before you even were born the word had already been written and spoken now it's up to you to take that letter of the word and eat it that you and that word and that prophecy will become real that's why i said the spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy he prophesied about you and we're here to be manifested as a living word of god that's been spoken thousands of years ago we have arrived satan knows it and he's doing everything he can to stop you don't feel bad you're not by yourself all of us have our particular battles but those battles are to hold you to keep you tied like a dog but god has broken the chain gold that you can eat every day every hour of the week that's where he's living in this kind of glory we're in the interlocked wings of the cherubims the great pillar of fire and the shekinah rest there and he's living under there he can he can't be nothing but a real genuine christian anytime and he said because of the atmosphere now the atmosphere is not behind the curtain the atmosphere is in you you the carrier of the atmosphere god in you what the hope of glory people this is where he's bringing us i know it sounds fictitious or it sounds hard to believe but you don't have the reason that you don't have to try to figure it out just take it it says lord that's me let that word be expressed in me clean me oh god wash me clean prepare me fashion me into your image lord men and women who lives there are misunderstood you see they become peculiar they don't hear the things of the world or if they do they don't pay attention to them they just move on god never put that in there for nothing god never come for just any haphazard way prayer is not perhaps prayer is sincere thing prayer is talking to god prayer is not get up get down and shut your eyes and think about your washing or your work you're doing say lord help me and john and heal miss jones and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of god and you're moving to then in the deepest of sincerity first it's a worship oh jehovah how i love you you see it then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking if you abide in me not go out from behind the curtain in the world today and run around and try to get back in the curtain tonight if you abide in me and my word about in you otherwise if you like aaron's rod that pull up to the shekinah glory by the golden part of the manna where you can eat it anytime and your soul is refreshed and blooming and yielding abiding if you abide in me my words abiding you then ask what you will and it will be given to you you see the failures of the church the pentecostals the methodists the baptists and all it's a failing to that abiding grace of god tonight you shout and clap your hands and dance in the aisle and speak in tongues that's gifts gifts is no good unless you're abiding in the shekinah glory these things are fine i have nothing to say against them they're of god shouting and blessings god in wonderful speaking in tongues and translation of tongues oh i mean interpretation of tongues it's the same and all these other things gifts of healing and prophecies and all these things are marvelous but they're no good they're not fruitful they can't hear the right unless you're living in the presence of the shekinah the atmosphere around you is godly that's the reason that men and women are not permitted to lead to these things because you go out here and call a blessing over something god is cursed or you curse something god is blessed it's abiding presence to know the will of god then don't look what the world's doing to say about you is what gods think about you then you're living in the presence the problem is we're not harming for the supernatural you know why because the teachers told us we didn't have to have all of that oh it's just the word is it the word well the word is not a thing the word is the person and that person is jesus christ himself and he's alive and well and he's still living doing the same thing did yesterday today and forever he's a healer he's a deliverer hallelujah he's a friend above all others he's a living god he's a creator of all things the bible said without him nothing was made he's still god and if you're talking about the word it's not just the letter of the word it's the living word and guess what if the word is living he's living in you that's where he want we want him to live in this tabernacle that he built for himself hallelujah is that all right we we're all hungry for hungry for supernatural you methodist brothers are hungry for for supernatural i got a method speeches within me that's hungering and thirsting for the supernatural you baptists are hungering and thirsting for supernatural all of them are now surely if god is still god he's still supernatural don't you believe that he's got to be he's got to be huh and you know where we failed we let people educate the message to us took us away from the dynamics gave us all nothing wrong with being educated in the message but you you we failed because we left the dynamics away and we say that was pentecostal hello you're pentecostal if you really born again and if you really got the holy ghost you're what we call pentecostal but pentecostal didn't just come with all of the the little gifts the greatest thing that the pentecostals had was the life of jesus on the inside that's why they were called christians it was the life that the people saw in them peter couldn't even sign his own name and he had the keys of the kingdom of god given to him by jesus christ he didn't have a doctrine of divinity he wasn't part of the the pharisees and the sadducees but i tell you what he had the greatest degree anybody could have hallelujah and he got that degree from the the university of jesus christ don't you understand every true believer walked down the aisle as magnum laude hallelujah straight ain't perfect we're looking to education he said education is fine but that's taught in school houses the church is the place to know god and learn of god in the supernatural what he said the church is a place to know god and to learn of god and in the supernatural that means supernatural is supposed to be happening in the church that's how we learn you heard brother brother stephen they were learning they were like children pray for peter but in their minds they thought peter was going to die but they learned they prayed for deliverance god dispatched an angel and if you read the scripture the bible said all of the prison doors were open you see why because the people were praying see that's why jesus you know you they always say jesus had to call lazarus by name because if he had not called larger by his name all of them would have gotten up and that's how it is they were praying and praying and god i can almost say lord unlock the door unlock the door what and god said okay he locked them out unlocked them all but they did not even know at the time the power of prayer just like the people in this message we don't know the power of prayer and i guarantee you we'll 99 of us will pass uh fail the test if we ask the question when you last prayed an hour and i'm not talking about struggling i mean caught up into a different atmosphere to wearing that you knew you were in the prayer in the presence of god hello they're rare but they shouldn't be rare this should be our daily bread talking to the lord jesus christ every day god help us the church is the place to know god and learn of god in in and that's what's and to learn of him in the news this is what he said in the supernatural and god is the supernatural and the same yesterday today and forever huh and then when we began to preach on listen listen you got to feel like i feel i am so tired of sicknesses diseases things that the early church dispelled by the power in the in the name of jesus christ they had a revelation or faith it worked and if it worked for them it'll work for us but you know what one thing about them they didn't have this the only thing they had was the living god on the inside we don't even know how many people read those letters from paul peter james or john we don't know we don't know how long it took to circulate the churches but one thing for certain when the holy ghost came he was recognized and it was the holy ghost that taught them is that the bible the bible said he will lead and guide you into all truth amen not bishop a pastor or reverend he the holy spirit sometimes we fail to just say lord what does that mean he's there to give you understanding sometimes i can tell you something may not be right my intentions wouldn't be that to do that but god will go and tell you the truth have you read the bible says lord where's that scripture where is that scripture lord i can't find it i know it's here somewhere and god just bring it to you i have incidents like that all the time i can't find something i just pray inside says lord where is it and he shows me listen to what i'm going to say here now this is just a quote from brother branham but i'm going to read it this is history as well he said i was reading here i believe it was charles g finney one of the greatest evangelists of the day and a converted lawyer there was an old man dying with tb y'all know what that means tuberculosis and before he died he laid on his face crying and praying and he raised up and he said well i was able to pray the prayer of faith for a certain city god's going to give a revival in that city and he narrowed it down about 15 different cities and after that man was dead and gone finicum by to his widow and picked up those cities and those revivals come just exactly the way that man said why is the question because one agonizing soul one soul before god in sincerity done more to bring revival than all the schools there was in the world that's right one soul prayed through and of you i'll tell you the greatest eastern revival of many years ago when uh when in africa when those heartened tots and so forth over there when they had a revival the very reason of it never come from their teachings in their big schools one poor illiterate unlearned colored man back in a little old haunt back there hut back there laid on his face day and night in the dust prayed to god sent a revival that swept all eastern and northern africa in the kingdom of god one may god help us and they had a revival there my water revival see people look at finney but they don't understand what it what happened before finney came right see there's going to be so many people and so many great ones i put this way rewards for those whose names you never would have known one written in the books wasn't written on history uh tablets but they prayed through for things to happen help us jesus see i don't know about you but that's the kind i want to be may god grant me the grace may god grant me the grace i'm not going to stop folks i see the way things are and and it tears me up you know i look even my own life and i'm like no this is not the way it should be i want more i got to have more of him but i know that the key is now it's always been there but you know what when god quickens something to you that's when it becomes real and the thing that gives me is that i don't need a bunch of folks i don't need a group one man one remember the time brother branham talks about those sisters behind the curtain those sisters that were praying behind the curtains he said that's the reason my meetings have been so successful he didn't even call their names but they were the ones praying you see what i'm saying it's not about self-recognition it's you in your closet you and god letting god use you for the purpose of today oh my god so be it what a revival what a ruin see and they had a revival there my what a revival but what ruined them what ruined them what happened to this message that used to be so on fire what ruined them i'm going to tell you he said then the teachers came down from england in different ways and began to set up in there began to teach theology and get away from the power of god and things like that and then the whole thing went into chaos and that's just exactly what happened in the united states of america help us jesus it ain't teaching paul said i came with the power and demonstration of the holy ghost some things are good to know but god ain't going to ask you what you learned what did those disciples ask john disciples have you received the holy ghost since you believed the people get away from god but god remains the same his nature his power his desires is always the same through every generation it never changes this is brother it's always the same it's the people that get away from god and not god from the people they lose their faith god covers all space all everywhere he's omnipotent he's everywhere and he's always has been and everywhere and he always will be everywhere but it's the aptitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord is the atmosphere that what brings the results you believe that let every man and woman in the building this morning boy and girl everything from their minds but uh excuse me get everything from their minds but the lord jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you'll see something happen that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning he said that's right it's the atmosphere help us jesus oh i don't know whether you feel him tonight but he's all up here it is the atmosphere that brings the miraculous you understand me we must stand as his wife who else he's rejected vastly the organizational system they didn't want him now he's looking for somebody to worship him in spirit and truth he said it's the atmosphere if you want to know where i'm getting these messages just let me know it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and the power of god among the people it's the atmosphere of the people and when people get into a place they're reasoning and wondering and stewing and thinking and all tore up and don't know where they they do they do stand half of them not even spiritually taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right you can't do it it won't be right it's got to be in one court one accord one place and settle down with one motive one thing then you're going to see something happen see even in this little church a friend of mine from florida called me he couldn't find a message church to go to so he's going to this baptist church but the atmosphere the anointing of god in this little fellowship and i don't know whether it connected to any other atmosphere but they just saw cancer instantly heal they saw this man heart who was uh in bad shape they were getting ready to do an operation the doctors thought to to look at it again and when he looked at it again there was no evidence the man had ever been sick see you got to understand it this thing is not local it's not just in this little place it's everywhere that's all god looking for people say do they have the holy ghost well that surely ain't the devil you understand me do you know god was giving people the holy ghost even when they was under the trinitarian doctrine brother random got it then that's when he got it and those assemblies or whatever their names were they were trinitarians but they believed god they saw him as his savior and god gave them the holy ghost see don't even come there because you trying to tell me that they got a different one no they didn't they got the same one the bible said they would get the sad thing about it is they didn't go further they didn't go all the way it was the same anointing is that not right that's what prophet god said and that true holy ghost amen that was real to those people eventually brought them to the baptism of the name in the name of the lord jesus christ what about those people who's never heard of that yet but yet they got the holy ghost and they living right see you don't you know what i'm saying you say that can't be true yes it is cornelius house got the holy ghost before they were even baptized the holy ghost is your condition of your heart i know that's against the message what people might think but i don't care what they think the truth is truth you can't tell me i wouldn't say before i got here i was saved i didn't know all of the truth like i know now but i met jesus you can't take that from me how are you going to take it take it from me you got to take away every experience brother branham had before he understood who he was the truth of the matter is those who were seed came forth those who were shocked stayed behind but you can't tell me that the life of the seed was not was never in the shock because the life of the shuck was the holy ghost hello but they had no idea that life was going to lead them eh right it's the truth it was ordained for it to leave and to form into the seed that's what brother brown was trying to tell them you're not the finish line there's another that you got to go further the word that's being preached this is what makes the message different it must be preached to the seed in order for us to grow into the very image and likeness of god we're not shocked we've come out from that it was good while it was there it preserved us but we moved into another dimension or a dispensation however you want to say it any person that ever come into that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else i'm gonna ask you something because a lot of times we sit back like pharisees and sadducees and think god can't use nobody but us but what about that woman who came to wash jesus feet in the midst of the pharisees and the sadducees they didn't even know what was going on but jesus understood she had been she was being led by the holy spirit she was that's what it was now she makes history a prostitute unconverted but she had god dealing with her that's all i'm saying we want to put god in a box you cannot put god in a box and ben any person that ever come into the atmosphere one time would never be satisfied nowhere else before i even knew god as as a creator i saw god create nobody can take that from me now let's put it this way i don't know where the corn came from but i asked the people around if they drop it they did not i saw it came out of a corner come round and spin around in me and laid right there in front of me because i needed some change to call somebody i was still in pentecost one day i was walking up the road i was late for church god says that morning he told me i'm gonna bless you with some money and i look for the mailman to bring it i'll look for a friend to bring it and not even a block from the church it had rain and as i was walking up the sidewalk god said look down and god had made that money stay fold it up by the rain that look at me like crazy it's the truth i got to stand before god i remember the time i told my wife i was going to get some money now these are cardinal things get spiritual now she may not remember this she said but yeah you know the income tax i said no no no it's going to be from somewhere else i didn't know i still don't know who this person was they sent me a check in the mail that day i looked in the mailbox it was a check from somebody i didn't even know she said i was in one of your meetings and you blessed me and god put it on my heart to send you five hundred dollars this is truth what i'm trying to say these little things and sometimes even in my trials even in my times where i i allowed satan to to dumb my eyes i forget what god has already done but everybody in here should have a testimony or something i know god has done some supernatural and though they be small think about all the great things or greater things he can do for you we need to just put the devil in his place and we need to learn how to stand in our place we need to stop letting satan come in here with sicknesses and walking out here like he's going to be victorious we somebody and i i'm one of them i'm going to pray i believe this word and i'm gonna contact god and i'm gonna see yeah you can join with me i mean in your own room because i'm gonna listen i know the devil listening but i'm not afraid of him i'm ordained bride so are you and nothing can stop us but our own unbelief that men and women in their work wherever they make should be should continue to continually desire and they will if they ever once come into that atmosphere he says if you once get in there you'll never want to get out you always thirst for it until you come again right but this time he says no you go in there and close the door don't come back out but if we could get a group together a group of people together where was genuine holy ghost atmosphere a sacredness and a sincerity and worship and men and women sitting in there are god conscious and know that great omnipotent of god is present ready to do all things without one shadow of doubt it'll even have an effect upon unbelievers that's setting in this evening you can never come into that atmosphere without something happening hmm god is good and i'm gonna close divine healing and sanctification and the power of god is as long as your faith last in it i'm gonna say it again divine healing sanctification and the power of god is as long as your faith lasts in it when your faith fails then your experience is gone it's based that way simply upon the finished work of christ at calvary you're sanctified as long as your testimony is right as long as you live a sanctified life and believe that god sanctified you you're sanctified counted it all to his grace and his merits and as long as you've accepted healing and believing your healing and go on believing it like that you'll be healed as long as you believe it and you start doubting it you take a man sitting here this morning that's not a bit sick and let him begin to get in his heart believing he is sick they'll pack him out of the building as your faith is so be it unto you as your faith is there's so much i i overdo things when i'm studying sorry about that but you know i look at this thing and i think to myself we can no longer wherever we are i don't know where you are you know some of us we may be in different places some in the outer court suddenly in the court some is in the holies of holies but wherever you are if you're not in the holies of holies don't stop you know those who are in the holy holies is the only one that makes the rapture right let me say that again i'm trying to think of the message i just finished listening to sea should not be aired with the shock brother adam tells us those who would make the rapture and those of us who get into the holies of holies you'll make the rapture and those of us who do not will be seen standing before the white throne judgment but they don't preach it like that they don't tell you go listen to the message see if i tell you the truth which i do but go listen to it it's not that you're not saved we're talking about a rapture we're talking about a perfect seed of god coming to maturity you know we handle it like it's a denomination or organizations once they come into the message they make it no they make it they may be saved and you know but making a rapture is two different things the holy ghost no doubt is in all of us but it must grow into a mature statue we must come to a perfect christ and these things come through trials and tribulations being tried in the fire it doesn't matter how good i can preach sing whatever i can do all those gifts are good but i still i've got to get there in order to make a rapture knowing brother branham that's fine but what did the angels say when john failed no no no get up worship god we come to worship god and the god that we worship is the god that lives in us you love the lord let's stand what i'm trying to say let me say it like this we are so far behind don't you know if god wanted to leave you he could have done it long time ago he's not saying oh i'm just not going to let you have this no no no [Music] at the end of the day it's going to boil down to your choosing your choice and how horrifying is going to be if we have heard the word and yet not become doers of it and god is not a tease as you hear me say you know you can have this and you you know you reach for it and i snatch it back that's not god but god is expecting determination perseverance look at it the woman with the issue of blood perseverance rahab perseverance you got to push you got to fight you got to deny yourself at every cost in every way and the only way we can do that is that like our brother said which which was a scripture that i've always been using i've been using acknowledge the lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path and that's what we fail we fail to acknowledge the lord in all our ways and this is why we come up with our own reasoning and our own thoughts and those things always get us in trouble i'm a witness a witness people the word of god came tonight not to badger you or to make you feel bad this is not what it's all about it came to enlighten and to encourage all of us wake up let's see what god is called don't you i do not want to come short of what his purpose is for me [Music] i truly believe that god has ordained me to be bride you must believe that too and if you do believe that say lord give me grace to be about your business let me die out let me rot whatever i need to do to to get to that place where you can say well done [Music] that's what we want if that old woman amen who didn't even know brother branham existed could contact god by prayer those heartentarts or that who are hot and taught in africa prayed until god brought a revival raised up a man what about us you pray for me and i'll pray for you let's pray now our heavenly father we do thank you for your grace and your mercy lord this is just the beginning of your messaging i pray that you'll give us more to preach on sunday if we should live to see god you're so rich in your mercy and you know you didn't come to condemn us that's what you said lord you came to give us life and more abundantly and the preaching of the word has come to give us life and more abundantly help us now as we learn of you see what your will is [Music] and give us the grace to perform it those who are here tonight who have sacrificed themselves to be lord we we are many faults within ourselves we fail throughout the day but there's a place in that shekinah glory will all this be done away with we have our battles in our flesh but in our spirit and our soul will be solely to surrender to you give us grace to be a slave to you lord let us surrender all to you lord that you might be pleased with us bless this assembly bless those who have a direct heart and those who have a desire to serve you lord let it be so give us grace lord to see and to move away from all distractions we ask these things in your lovely name
