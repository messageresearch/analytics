[58:28] to take the first place
[58:32] lord jesus christ
[58:36] amen amen amen let's uh open our bibles
[58:39] in the book of psalms
[58:42] we read the chapter 55 of psalms
[58:49] we read from verse 1 to verse
[58:52] 7.
[58:55] then we'll jump to the 22nd verse
[59:01] psalms 55 verse 1 to verse 7
[59:07] and then verse 22.
[59:13] amen the bible says
[59:16] give ear to my prayer o god and hide not
[59:20] thy self for my supplications
[59:24] [Music]
[59:27] attend unto me and hear me
[59:30] i i i mourn i am i mourn in my complain
[59:34] and make a noise
[59:41] because of the voice of the enemy
[59:43] because of the oppression of the wicked
[59:46] for they cast iniquity upon me
[59:49] and in rough they hate me
[59:59] my heart is sore pain within me
[1:00:02] and the terrors of death are fallen upon
[1:00:06] me
[1:00:12] fearfulness and trembling are come upon
[1:00:15] me
[1:00:15] and hope and horror
[1:00:17] has
[1:00:18] overwhelmed me
[1:00:25] and i said
[1:00:26] oh that i oh that i had wings like a
[1:00:28] dove for then would i fly away
[1:00:32] and be at rest
[1:00:39] then i would
[1:00:40] then without wandering far off and
[1:00:42] remain in the wilderness
[1:00:49] verse 22
[1:00:53] the bible says
[1:00:54] cast that burden upon the lord and he
[1:00:56] shall sustain thee
[1:00:58] he shall never suffer the righteousness
[1:01:01] to be moved
[1:01:22] subtitle i have it uh enforce the lord
[1:01:25] of god
[1:01:30] amen i had two subjects so i didn't know
[1:01:33] which one to choose
[1:01:35] from
[1:01:37] amen so here we see in verse 55 david
[1:01:41] he's resting his case
[1:01:47] you know before god's praises
[1:01:50] you know he's saying that give here to
[1:01:51] my prayer oh god and hide not thyself
[1:01:54] from my of my supplication
[1:02:02] amen because he found himself he was in
[1:02:04] trouble
[1:02:07] and he couldn't go anywhere else
[1:02:10] so the only place that he had to go was
[1:02:12] to god
[1:02:14] you know that's why he said i give here
[1:02:16] to my prayer
[1:02:46] amen if we go back uh uh to start my
[1:02:48] subject if we go back in uh uh genesis
[1:02:51] chapter 15 verse 1 to verse 6
[1:02:59] genesis chapter 15 verse
[1:03:04] so here you'll find that abraham was
[1:03:06] splitting his case before god
[1:03:10] you know because he found himself
[1:03:12] you know getting older
[1:03:22] after these things the word of the lord
[1:03:24] came unto abraham it came unto abraham
[1:03:27] in a vision saying fear not abraham i am
[1:03:30] that shield and i exceeding great reward
[1:03:42] and abram said lord god
[1:03:44] what will thou give me seeing i go
[1:03:47] childless
[1:03:48] and the steward of my house is this
[1:03:51] illegal
[1:03:52] of damascus
[1:04:01] amen that was his play that was his that
[1:04:03] was you know he was pleading his case
[1:04:05] before god
[1:04:07] you know saying that lord you have
[1:04:09] promised me all those promises don't say
[1:04:11] nature
[1:04:12] lord you gave me all those promises
[1:04:16] lord here i am lord you blessed me
[1:04:19] lord here i am i'm gay i'm i'm going
[1:04:21] childless
[1:04:23] you know soon i will die
[1:04:38] is you know he's the one that i have the
[1:04:41] one that i trust right now
[1:04:44] but lord i'm going i'm going away
[1:04:46] without the sun
[1:04:48] so now verse three the bible says that
[1:04:50] and abraham said behold to me
[1:04:52] behold to me thou has given no seed and
[1:04:56] little one born in my house is mine in
[1:04:58] my hair
[1:05:05] so now here verse 3 abraham is trying to
[1:05:07] give alternative to god
[1:05:11] you know saying that you know whoever
[1:05:13] will be born in my house
[1:05:17] you know he will be he is the one who
[1:05:18] will take control of everything
[1:05:22] so now here's the response of the lord
[1:05:25] and behold the word of the word of the
[1:05:27] lord came unto him saying
[1:05:32] you know this shall not be done here
[1:05:47] that you're trying to give me will not
[1:05:49] work
[1:05:51] you know it's not what i have in my
[1:05:53] thoughts
[1:05:54] you know what i have in my thought that
[1:05:56] you have to have your own eyes
[1:05:59] you know you have to have you know
[1:06:01] someone has to come out of your
[1:06:04] you know that he is the one who will
[1:06:06] take care we take care of everything
[1:06:11] and he brought and he brought him forth
[1:06:13] abroad and said
[1:06:27] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[1:06:30] be
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:00] you know lord
[1:07:01] i have confidence in him he's the one
[1:07:03] who will take care of or take care of
[1:07:05] everything after me
[1:07:08] lord whoever will be born in my house is
[1:07:11] the one who will do everything
[1:07:23] you know god knew exactly what abraham
[1:07:26] was what was
[1:07:30] you know god knew exactly what what was
[1:07:32] the answer the answer that abraham was
[1:07:34] expecting to hear from god jesus
[1:07:38] so therefore before god pronounced that
[1:07:40] word
[1:07:42] of the pronounce
[1:07:44] to prepare the land
[1:07:47] you know he had to prepare the heart of
[1:07:49] abraham
[1:07:51] you know he had to take away the stony
[1:07:53] heart
[1:07:56] you know he had to take away all the day
[1:07:58] out inside of abraham
[1:08:00] you know in order that when god will
[1:08:02] speak the word
[1:08:05] you know abraham we have nothing else
[1:08:07] but to believe that word
[1:08:15] you know because i think it was 75 or 80
[1:08:17] years old at that time
[1:08:19] you know but when abraham will hear that
[1:08:21] word
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:32] so that's why you know in verse six the
[1:08:34] bible said that abraham believed in the
[1:08:36] lord
[1:08:38] abraham
[1:08:40] and he counted him he counted he counted
[1:08:43] it to him for righteousness
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:46] amen he believed in the lord
[1:08:49] you confirmed
[1:08:50] that was counted
[1:08:54] so now if we if we keep on going verse
[1:08:56] seven she will continue
[1:08:58] he said that now abraham and now now he
[1:09:00] said unto him
[1:09:04] i am the lord that brought thee out of
[1:09:06] er
[1:09:10] to give the this land to inherit it
[1:09:15] and he said lord god whereabouts shall i
[1:09:18] know that that i shall inherit it
[1:09:24] you know now
[1:09:25] god is giving abraham the sign you see
[1:09:30] and he said unto him
[1:09:32] take me and here for of three years old
[1:09:37] and the she goes of three years old
[1:09:40] and the realm of three years old um
[1:09:43] and it traded off
[1:09:45] and a young pigeon in jean colombo and
[1:09:47] he took unto him all these
[1:09:50] and divided them in the midst
[1:09:55] and laid each piece a one against
[1:09:58] one against another amish
[1:10:14] lord
[1:10:22] so now god is giving god gave him the
[1:10:24] sign that he was looking forward
[1:10:26] to this so now if you look at it closely
[1:10:28] you look closely to verse 9.
[1:10:32] you see that god asks abraham to take
[1:10:34] five five animals
[1:10:38] you know those animals because he had uh
[1:10:41] he had a heifer is his animal genius the
[1:10:45] she goat devin chevro he had a ram
[1:10:48] unbelievable it turtledove
[1:10:50] and then a pigeon in colombo you know
[1:10:52] five clean animals it sank animal and
[1:10:55] all of those animals were three were
[1:10:57] three or three years of age
[1:11:01] you know typifying christ
[1:11:03] you know five is the number of grace
[1:11:07] you know three years old remember you
[1:11:09] know from the baptism of jesus christ to
[1:11:11] his death was 3 years
[1:11:16] amen and then god tell them to abraham
[1:11:18] to divide those animals into a dread
[1:11:22] you know that was the type of the cross
[1:11:32] you know now he is giving us his grace
[1:11:34] he may not in the contract you know
[1:11:35] dividing himself
[1:11:37] you know god took the body
[1:11:40] and gave us the spirit
[1:11:43] you know so that that spirit being in us
[1:11:46] you know we can go straight to god and
[1:11:48] plead our case at calvary
[1:11:52] you know we can go
[1:12:06] you know but you can go straight to god
[1:12:08] director
[1:12:09] he rendered the curtains enough
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:13] you know to give you an open interest
[1:12:18] instrument to the holies of holy
[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:31] you know it opened that line that line
[1:12:33] that was closed between men and men and
[1:12:35] god
[1:12:38] so that now men can have a personal
[1:12:40] relationship with their creators
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:47] whenever they need
[1:12:48] god don't shut
[1:12:50] oh whenever they need help check
[1:12:52] zombies one day man they can go to their
[1:12:54] clothes
[1:12:56] they close donation and close their
[1:12:58] doors family pot and stop praying
[1:13:01] and god will hear them why because you
[1:13:05] wanted that relationship to be restored
[1:13:08] that's why when he was promising abraham
[1:13:11] a son
[1:13:13] you know he had to give him that
[1:13:15] you know he had to give him that sign
[1:13:18] you know to say that abraham the son
[1:13:20] that i'm promising
[1:13:23] you know he's a type of a promised son
[1:13:25] that is christ
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:27] you know who will come he will bring joy
[1:13:29] to the world
[1:13:42] you know he will set the capture free
[1:13:44] eva
[1:13:58] he was wounded blissey he was bruised
[1:14:02] he was smart
[1:14:05] so that you can go and plead your case
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:10] the prophet said that by being wounded
[1:14:11] the prophet
[1:14:24] so from calvary's cross where the
[1:14:26] bruising
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:39] like a bunch of walls upon him come on
[1:14:42] um
[1:14:45] he made he made his gift from calvary
[1:14:48] and he landed in
[1:14:50] heaven's doors
[1:14:53] remember
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:09] they are free it's unbelievable sickness
[1:15:11] can be healed now
[1:15:14] sinners can be saved
[1:15:17] the captive can be free can be set free
[1:15:22] why because he accepted to suffer that
[1:15:24] pain
[1:15:26] you know he accepted to go through all
[1:15:28] of their you know
[1:15:29] you know for you to be for you to be
[1:15:31] free
[1:15:32] you know so that you can go to him and
[1:15:34] plead your case
[1:15:51] because when you read the psalms
[1:15:53] you know most of the time when you read
[1:15:55] the psalms they could follow you know
[1:15:57] those are david's prayers
[1:16:00] you know david's song is only shown to
[1:16:02] them you know simplifications
[1:16:04] you know prayer is asking god for
[1:16:06] deliverance
[1:16:08] you know asking god for support
[1:16:12] you know asking god for strength
[1:16:15] you know whenever david was in need
[1:16:18] you know
[1:16:41] you know he had to go to god for
[1:16:43] forgiveness
[1:16:45] you know when the enemies were there and
[1:16:47] wanted to kill him
[1:16:50] you know he had to go before god
[1:16:53] you know he had to go before god for
[1:16:55] refuge
[1:16:57] amen and that is the that is the example
[1:16:59] that the christians should
[1:17:01] example
[1:17:02] whenever you need help
[1:17:05] go to him
[1:17:07] you know he has an open ears he just
[1:17:09] want to hear you know
[1:17:12] a man he has a he has a secure line that
[1:17:15] is set only for you
[1:17:18] you know so that whenever you need him
[1:17:23] you know just call happily you know like
[1:17:26] daniel daniel you know when he started
[1:17:28] to pray
[1:17:30] before even opening his mouth
[1:17:33] you know god already sent angels to come
[1:17:35] and answer his prayers
[1:17:40] that's the same thing that happens see
[1:17:41] like
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:18:02] amen here's paul
[1:18:05] he's saying that therefore being
[1:18:07] justified by faith
[1:18:24] our lord jesus christ
[1:18:28] by whom also we have access by faith
[1:18:31] into his great into this grace wherein
[1:18:33] we stand amen
[1:18:37] foreign
[1:18:52] knowing that tribulation work is
[1:18:54] patience
[1:18:57] and patience experience perseverance
[1:19:00] and experience
[1:19:03] and hope mick is not ashamed of the
[1:19:05] experience
[1:19:06] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:19:09] in our hearts but the whole is by the
[1:19:11] holy ghost which he has given unto us
[1:19:17] now
[1:19:18] that's my favorite verse of this chapter
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:44] man will one die
[1:19:47] yet pure adventure for a good man some
[1:19:50] would even dare to die
[1:19:58] but god commendeth his love toward us
[1:20:02] in that while
[1:20:26] you know christ already you know could
[1:20:28] cleanse you with his blood
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:44] you know when the devil says that you
[1:20:45] can't be saved
[1:20:48] you know when he says that you can't
[1:20:49] receive the holy spirit
[1:20:51] you know you just have to repeat these
[1:20:53] words
[1:20:54] you know yet before i was a sinner a
[1:20:56] function a man christ died for me kissed
[1:20:59] him upon him before i was even born
[1:21:02] avocation the man he died for me
[1:21:05] so i don't care what you want to tell me
[1:21:08] man i don't care whatever you want to
[1:21:09] say
[1:21:11] i don't care what evidence you trying to
[1:21:13] bring before god very important if you
[1:21:15] don't you know saying that
[1:21:17] or i have evidence of him sinning if he
[1:21:20] doesn't
[1:21:21] man i have the text that he was testing
[1:21:23] to someone
[1:21:25] you know texting about gossiping
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:40] you know when all of those complaints
[1:21:42] comes before god
[1:21:44] you know god will look at the devil and
[1:21:46] say
[1:21:47] you know i declare him not guilty
[1:21:51] you know and that not it won't even stop
[1:21:53] by saying not guilty
[1:22:06] amen god purchase your god purchase you
[1:22:09] by his blood
[1:22:10] amen the crimson blood of cry of christ
[1:22:13] cleanse you from all your sins
[1:22:17] but you just have to accept it
[1:22:20] man you just have to go and rest your
[1:22:21] case of calvary
[1:22:27] so here paul is talking about
[1:22:29] justification
[1:22:32] you know you will see that justification
[1:22:35] you know it's it's it's as if you didn't
[1:22:37] do it in the first place
[1:22:41] you know why
[1:22:43] it's because uh there is a i heard a
[1:22:45] brother was saying one one time
[1:22:48] that there's a country
[1:22:50] you know bach i think in you know uh uh
[1:22:54] like in the 60s or
[1:22:57] a long long time ago
[1:22:59] you know before i was born of october
[1:23:01] 20. amen he says that you know in that
[1:23:03] country it also be when somebody do you
[1:23:06] know when someone does something wrong
[1:23:08] those crooked confidence you know they
[1:23:11] use the word to justify
[1:23:14] it they had to justify him
[1:23:17] you know in other words that they had to
[1:23:19] kill that person
[1:23:21] person you know and killing that person
[1:23:23] onto your sister's son you know that
[1:23:25] means that everything that he did before
[1:23:27] him made everything that he did when he
[1:23:29] was alive
[1:23:32] it's all gone a party but if that person
[1:23:35] you know comes up you know it never
[1:23:36] happened the person you know resurrect
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:41] you know but if that person you know
[1:23:43] something happened that that person yeah
[1:23:44] that person you know is is
[1:23:47] resurrected
[1:23:50] you know that person will come back as a
[1:23:52] new person
[1:23:54] because everything wrong that he did
[1:23:57] died with him
[1:24:00] amen in other words that person is now
[1:24:02] justified
[1:24:04] amen that's the same thing that christ
[1:24:06] did for us
[1:24:07] amen the bible plainly say that the soul
[1:24:10] does sinners that so that will perish
[1:24:31] you know he took our place and he died
[1:24:33] for us
[1:24:35] you know and then in other words that
[1:24:36] you know we are now that's why we are
[1:24:38] now justified
[1:24:41] because everything that we did
[1:24:44] for every and everything that we're
[1:24:45] going to do
[1:24:47] you know he died for us
[1:24:49] you know he was punished for it
[1:24:52] and then and then that's why that's the
[1:24:54] thing that is making us being justified
[1:24:57] you know as if we never done it we've
[1:24:59] never done it in the first place
[1:25:01] amen because christ took out the christ
[1:25:04] took our punishment
[1:25:08] he took it with him on the cross
[1:25:25] has nothing to do with us
[1:25:27] no it's just a resting place
[1:25:30] that we go for a while
[1:25:32] but we go where we know that one day
[1:25:35] you know when that trumpet will sound
[1:25:37] competitive amen all the
[1:25:41] amen and those who will still be alive
[1:25:44] amen there will be quicken
[1:25:46] there will be change
[1:25:47] in the twinkling of an eye on including
[1:25:49] amen because christ took our place
[1:25:58] you know raise your shoulders and and go
[1:26:00] tell the devil that i'm free
[1:26:04] and whatever he will try to tell you
[1:26:18] you know but that doesn't mean that you
[1:26:20] don't have to come to god and ask for
[1:26:22] forgiveness
[1:26:25] amen as a christian we have to go before
[1:26:28] god every day and ask for forgiveness
[1:26:34] amen
[1:26:36] the prophet says the prophet
[1:26:38] now listen
[1:26:40] then the the list of the believers of
[1:26:43] his believers
[1:26:45] i took this quote from brother brooks
[1:26:47] because he read it on wednesday night
[1:26:53] now listen the list of his believers
[1:26:57] no matter how long
[1:26:59] or little or whatever you are people
[1:27:16] christ is the head of the body
[1:27:20] is that right
[1:27:21] well wherever the head is
[1:27:24] the body is with it
[1:27:28] where my head goes it takes my body with
[1:27:31] it
[1:27:36] and where jesus is the church is with
[1:27:38] him
[1:27:42] amen he don't get out of his word
[1:27:58] the head wherever the head is
[1:28:02] that's where the body will be
[1:28:04] amen if the head is a victorious if the
[1:28:07] head is victorious
[1:28:10] that means that their hand is also
[1:28:11] victorious
[1:28:23] jesus christ overcame everything jesus
[1:28:26] christ
[1:28:40] that's something the core you just have
[1:28:43] to have faith
[1:28:45] amen to enforce the law of god
[1:28:49] you know to the devil
[1:28:51] and tell him exactly what god promised
[1:28:53] you
[1:28:53] exactly
[1:29:08] there's three type of people or three
[1:29:10] kinds of faith
[1:29:13] you know there is people who don't
[1:29:14] believe yeah
[1:29:16] you know even though something is clear
[1:29:18] they just don't believe me
[1:29:20] you know they don't want to believe in
[1:29:22] the verb
[1:29:23] you know the second group of people is
[1:29:24] is those people
[1:29:28] where the intellect you know knows that
[1:29:30] god is real
[1:29:35] you know in their head they know that
[1:29:36] this miracle that just happened is real
[1:29:41] and then they're trying their best to
[1:29:43] believe
[1:29:45] amen they're trying their best to
[1:29:47] believe
[1:29:49] the promise of god the promise
[1:30:00] those are the group the third group
[1:30:02] that's where the group that every every
[1:30:04] promise of god always comes to pass see
[1:30:06] uh
[1:30:10] amen because he's not trying to force
[1:30:12] himself to believe those promises
[1:30:16] amen he's not trying to force to agree
[1:30:18] with those promises
[1:30:23] or he's not trying to sympathize with
[1:30:25] those promises
[1:30:28] but those promises has been revealed to
[1:30:30] him
[1:30:32] and the faith of god has been revealed
[1:30:34] to him
[1:30:36] amen that's what when they hear those
[1:30:38] promises
[1:30:41] without asking no questions
[1:30:44] you know that's why you have you see
[1:30:45] abraham
[1:30:47] you know when god gave him the promise
[1:30:48] of a son
[1:30:50] you know that was a revelation to
[1:30:52] abraham
[1:30:55] he believed that promise yeah
[1:30:57] but you say but where isaac but what do
[1:30:59] you mean the brother faith is a promise
[1:31:02] i mean faith is a revelation
[1:31:07] you know everybody who came before moses
[1:31:11] you know those people didn't have the
[1:31:13] bible to read
[1:31:15] moses is the one who wrote the bible the
[1:31:17] first the first book of the bible
[1:31:21] you know tell me where those people were
[1:31:23] getting you know that wisdom to have
[1:31:26] faith in god
[1:31:30] where was there getting you know that
[1:31:32] you know that faith
[1:31:34] you know it wasn't because the word or
[1:31:36] the promise of god was pleasing to their
[1:31:38] ears
[1:31:42] you know it was because those promises
[1:31:44] and those words were revealed to them
[1:31:49] you know you have for example
[1:31:51] for example amen
[1:31:53] out of the out of the the garden of eden
[1:32:11] the god that faith to offer to offer a
[1:32:13] lamb for for sacrifices
[1:32:21] you know that's why sometimes we just
[1:32:23] don't have to force ourselves to believe
[1:32:25] something
[1:32:28] amen you can do you know you you have
[1:32:30] the promise of god god said that you
[1:32:31] know you uh but uh he was bruised for us
[1:32:34] he was bruised and and beaten so that we
[1:32:37] can be healed
[1:32:46] all of them they read the same the same
[1:32:48] text
[1:32:50] but you see one is healed and the other
[1:32:52] one is
[1:32:54] you know both of them will say amen
[1:32:57] amen but you see one is here then the
[1:32:59] other one is
[1:33:02] amen because sympathizing with the word
[1:33:06] you
[1:33:22] but inside of you that's not change it's
[1:33:24] not changing
[1:33:27] your spirit can create those emotions
[1:33:30] and atmospheres
[1:33:33] but as long as that revelation is not
[1:33:35] into your soul
[1:33:39] nothing will happen
[1:33:41] so our prayers to god will be that lord
[1:33:43] give me that revelation of the face i
[1:33:45] don't know
[1:33:48] so that whenever
[1:34:13] you know the work has to be manifested
[1:34:15] reserved manifest amen because when
[1:34:18] abraham believed it
[1:34:21] he had two testimonies
[1:34:23] one testimony from god loving all the
[1:34:25] jews and the other testimony from the
[1:34:27] men from people
[1:34:29] amen james wrote the testimony of
[1:34:31] abraham according to people
[1:34:36] and paul wrote the testimony of abraham
[1:34:38] according to god
[1:34:42] you know in other words james wrote the
[1:34:43] testimony
[1:34:52] his work that was the
[1:34:53] the work of his faith that was the thing
[1:34:55] that justified him
[1:34:59] and then and then paul said you know
[1:35:01] paul said what was it was the faith that
[1:35:03] god gave him
[1:35:06] amen in other words that
[1:35:08] james saw what man was saying
[1:35:12] for you
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:25] you know we will not be able to open
[1:35:27] your soul and then see the faith
[1:35:30] but the only way that we can see the
[1:35:31] faith that you proclaim to say you
[1:35:33] proclaim to say that you have me
[1:35:38] seeing the works
[1:35:40] amen in other words that works is the
[1:35:42] weakness of faith
[1:35:47] works give weakness of faith of the
[1:35:49] faith that you have inside
[1:35:53] amen that's why abraham
[1:35:55] when he believed god
[1:35:57] he started walking
[1:35:59] dr abraham get get get
[1:36:02] i want to lead you to a land
[1:36:05] you know abraham didn't know the land
[1:36:08] abraham never heard the voice of god
[1:36:10] before
[1:36:11] that voice of god just quickened his
[1:36:13] soul i said what did you have
[1:36:15] something amen quickened the first that
[1:36:17] was slipping inside of him
[1:36:20] and you gave him strength to start
[1:36:22] walking caught in the fossils you know
[1:36:24] gave him strength to start walking
[1:36:26] you know in other words abraham was
[1:36:28] raising up his hand and said lord
[1:36:29] wherever you want to lead me lord lead
[1:36:31] me i will follow you
[1:36:32] abraham
[1:36:36] amen that's what
[1:36:51] you know god didn't tell abraham where
[1:36:53] he was going
[1:36:55] you know god was teaching abraham how to
[1:36:57] trust him
[1:36:59] come on you know sometimes
[1:37:01] we read things in the bible that we
[1:37:03] don't understand uh the fundamental
[1:37:06] you know you get the half of the of the
[1:37:08] verse and the other half you don't get
[1:37:10] it
[1:37:13] you know whatever you got
[1:37:15] two scoops of it you know
[1:37:16] have faith either start walking
[1:37:46] amen go to him in prayer i live
[1:37:49] amen and and then he is our healer
[1:37:53] amen you read that word
[1:37:55] you just get the part that that by the
[1:37:57] bible said that he is a healer
[1:38:11] you know god never taught abraham when
[1:38:13] he was going to give him a sign of son
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:30] you know he saw a vision of joseph
[1:38:34] you know he saw a vision of god giving
[1:38:36] me a son
[1:38:38] and he called his name joseph
[1:38:41] joseph when his wife was pregnant
[1:38:44] you know everybody thought that you know
[1:38:46] this is joseph coming
[1:38:48] today
[1:38:49] but his wife gave birth to her girls to
[1:38:51] sarah he is a
[1:38:53] farmer
[1:38:54] you know many people say that you know
[1:38:56] he is a false prophet
[1:38:58] you know there's even one brother who
[1:39:00] called the prophet
[1:39:02] and started laughing
[1:39:05] then god punished our brother and that
[1:39:06] brother died
[1:39:09] amen the thing that people didn't
[1:39:10] understand
[1:39:12] is that when god
[1:39:14] showed that vision to him
[1:39:17] god never told them when their son was
[1:39:19] coming
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:22] god told him that you will have a son
[1:39:24] julian
[1:39:26] and he named him joseph
[1:39:28] jose you know god never told him that
[1:39:29] that son will come after 10 other child
[1:39:32] 10 other children
[1:39:36] will come after five years
[1:39:50] the doctor said that your wife cannot
[1:39:52] conceive anymore
[1:39:54] you know because if she tries again she
[1:39:56] would die
[1:39:58] the prophet was telling them that you
[1:39:59] know that that's not your that's not
[1:40:01] your problem
[1:40:03] you know god gave me a vision of another
[1:40:05] son
[1:40:06] you know
[1:40:34] if people were laughing at him
[1:40:36] you know saying that he saw a josephine
[1:40:38] he's only like
[1:40:40] you know he saw a girl instead of a sort
[1:40:43] of a
[1:40:44] of a boy
[1:40:47] you know he knew what he saw
[1:41:03] you know when the devil was trying to
[1:41:04] create obstacles
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:07] saying that his wife was not going to
[1:41:09] conceive anymore
[1:41:11] you know the prophet had to to enforce
[1:41:13] the law of god
[1:41:15] you know he said telling them that this
[1:41:17] is what god told me
[1:41:20] what will happen
[1:41:21] amen there is no negotiation
[1:41:24] you know this is what it is and this is
[1:41:25] what will be
[1:41:31] all the successful say you know they say
[1:41:32] that you know there is no water up in
[1:41:34] the upper ball
[1:41:39] no one knew what they heard nowhere
[1:41:42] no one knew what is so
[1:41:44] good so he didn't matter if the journal
[1:41:46] oh if the the news were saying that he
[1:41:48] was a false prophet or he was a false
[1:41:51] teacher
[1:41:56] a man he knew exactly what he saw
[1:42:09] you know even though he was the only one
[1:42:11] seeing that vision let's see let's
[1:42:26] all those children of israel
[1:42:29] israel they knew the promise of god
[1:42:31] isabella promises
[1:42:33] that i will be with you and i will
[1:42:34] deliver you
[1:42:36] today amen they knew the promise of god
[1:42:39] they knew the promise that god gave to
[1:42:41] joshua couldn't heal upon you
[1:42:43] that wherever your footstep will be you
[1:42:45] will have that blend in position
[1:42:48] you know all of them knew those words
[1:42:53] you know all of them in their prayers
[1:42:54] they were repeating those words
[1:42:58] but
[1:42:59] god revealed that word to david only
[1:43:02] reflected
[1:43:03] amen so that when david saw goliath
[1:43:07] david wasn't going by you know a word or
[1:43:10] a scripture that he knew intellectually
[1:43:15] amen david was not going but with the
[1:43:17] scripture that he learned in his son's
[1:43:18] school
[1:43:21] amen but david was going
[1:44:02] amen and then we know the results
[1:44:07] amen because david to him was revealed
[1:44:10] the word of the lord
[1:44:13] that's why it doesn't matter how many
[1:44:14] scriptures that you know
[1:44:17] amen it doesn't matter how many quotes
[1:44:19] that you know commented
[1:44:21] hey man it doesn't matter how many but
[1:44:23] how many bible uh how many uh uh tape
[1:44:26] that you hear every day
[1:44:30] it's good
[1:44:31] but as long as those tips are not
[1:44:33] revealed to you
[1:44:37] amen you're just feeding your
[1:44:38] intellectuals
[1:44:40] you know but you have to pray god
[1:44:42] create that lord every time i hear your
[1:44:44] words
[1:44:46] no let that
[1:44:58] knew exactly that going to church only
[1:45:00] will not save me
[1:45:05] knew exactly that giving giving my
[1:45:06] tithes will not save me
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:10] you know giving my offerings will not
[1:45:12] save me
[1:45:13] or singing will not save me
[1:45:16] or making sacrifice to get a church will
[1:45:18] not save me
[1:45:19] you know even though all these things
[1:45:21] are good
[1:45:23] you know but he knew one thing we would
[1:45:25] save him
[1:45:27] amen was the revelation
[1:45:31] and kane all of them offered the
[1:45:32] sacrifice
[1:45:37] amen all of them took their time they do
[1:45:39] have you know to prepare an offering for
[1:45:42] god
[1:45:47] and that was the sacrifice that was the
[1:45:49] offering that god was looking at
[1:45:51] amen that's what when we come to church
[1:45:54] you know we have to come by revelations
[1:45:58] sunday morning when you wake up
[1:46:00] oh every wednesday when you come to
[1:46:02] church
[1:46:03] you have to come about revelation
[1:46:05] amen you have to pray god lord reveal me
[1:46:08] give me the revelation of yours
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:23] circumstance that i'm going through
[1:46:27] that when i will hear those words
[1:46:30] amen i will have the faith
[1:46:32] to overcome it
[1:46:34] amen david
[1:46:36] he had to enforce the law of god
[1:46:46] he came and he saw all the wives that
[1:46:48] was they that were left in the city were
[1:46:50] gone
[1:47:06] had to go claim those servants
[1:47:10] amen and when david went to claim those
[1:47:13] everybody that belonged to him
[1:47:17] amen he didn't go to negotiate with the
[1:47:19] with the with those philistines
[1:47:22] he didn't go to negotiate with those
[1:47:24] enemies
[1:47:26] but he went to take the everything that
[1:47:28] belonged to him
[1:47:31] and then he went with the promise i'm
[1:47:33] going to take them back
[1:48:02] you take the promise of god
[1:48:04] amen you take the law of god the law of
[1:48:06] god and then you go enforce into him
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:10] and you present the word to him
[1:48:13] and say that here's the word
[1:48:15] now i need everything that belongs to me
[1:48:17] i need them back
[1:48:19] only
[1:48:20] you know i don't need a conversation
[1:48:21] with you
[1:48:23] but i am taking everything
[1:48:26] amen because they belong to him
[1:48:29] they are my property
[1:48:31] amen god gave them to me
[1:48:34] so therefore i have the rights
[1:48:37] to take them back
[1:48:38] to you amen if the devil took your
[1:48:40] privilege to become a son of god
[1:48:44] amen
[1:49:11] amen god promised those to me
[1:49:14] amen when he was dying on the cross
[1:49:17] he said that it is finished
[1:49:19] when he said it is finished
[1:49:21] that means that everything is finished
[1:49:24] amen everything that i will need
[1:49:54] fight
[1:49:56] because christ
[1:50:00] will overcome over all of those battles
[1:50:03] and then you're asking you for one thing
[1:50:05] only if the modern church accept him
[1:50:08] accept the victory
[1:50:10] and it's course you see
[1:50:12] you've been suffering for a long time
[1:50:15] accept the victory

[1:50:19] you've been praying for a long time
[1:50:22] accept the victory it is yours
[1:50:25] amen accept the answers

[1:50:34] victory
[1:50:35] amen accept the victory
[1:50:40] it is yours
[1:50:42] like abraham
[1:50:43] you know he told the servant
[1:50:46] i'm going up and i will return me and
[1:50:48] the son will we come back
[1:51:01] as long as those words came out of his
[1:51:03] mouth may allah
[1:51:18] and then he
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:33] is it so simple women have faith in god
[1:51:36] and speak the word
[1:51:37] now the prophet said that so faith so is
[1:51:40] faith
[1:51:41] so it is faith that doesn't produce
[1:51:44] worth
[1:51:45] the prophetic
[1:51:48] anyone has the right to doubt your
[1:51:50] testimony
[1:51:53] if your faith doesn't produce works see
[1:51:55] voter foreign
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:13] you can't make anyone believe that you
[1:52:15] are healed
[1:52:18] say well i don't know see
[1:52:22] why yeah sure
[1:52:25] i got all the faith in the world
[1:52:28] but you you don't
[1:52:30] have because if you are
[1:52:33] or if you got faith
[1:52:35] then works is merit to faith
[1:52:39] husband and wife
[1:52:42] one identifies the other with the other
[1:52:44] one

[1:59:21] now the devil will start to bring
[1:59:22] thought inside of you
[1:59:26] you know the devil will start bringing
[1:59:28] you know all kinds of stuff
[1:59:30] with you amen you're going through this
[1:59:32] because you did this
[1:59:35] god is not hearing your prayer because
[1:59:36] you're sinned
[1:59:39] in your prayer because you did this
[1:59:42] and then all
[2:00:38] 13 verse 18 to 23.
[2:00:46] amen the bible says that hear ye
[2:00:48] therefore the parable of the sword
[2:00:53] when anyone hears the word of the
[2:00:55] kingdom this is the is giving now the
[2:00:58] interpreter
[2:01:00] is now interpreting the the the parable
[2:01:02] he gave in the first
[2:01:04] first verse
[2:01:10] when anyone hears the word of god of the
[2:01:12] kingdom and understandeth it not lost
[2:01:17] then cometh the wicked one
[2:01:20] and catches the way
[2:01:22] that which was sung in his heart
[2:01:29] this is he which received seed by the
[2:01:31] way
[2:01:42] the same is he that hears the word and
[2:01:45] ending with joe receive it which
[2:01:48] received
[2:02:02] earth for a while is monkey persistence
[2:02:05] for when tribulation or persecution
[2:02:07] rises because of the word
[2:02:12] and why he is offended
[2:02:15] he also now received the seed among the
[2:02:17] thorns
[2:02:20] is he that hears the word
[2:02:23] and the care of this world
[2:02:26] and the deceitfulness of riches
[2:02:30] shocked the word
[2:03:05] so now the question is you know
[2:03:08] you know how are you going to have that
[2:03:10] good ground
[2:03:12] in natural when somebody want to you
[2:03:13] know uh uh sow seed
[2:03:18] it just doesn't come it just it does
[2:03:20] doesn't go doesn't go and then start you
[2:03:22] know taking corns and and just um
[2:03:24] throwing seeds wherever you need
[2:03:39] to put water to water the land and do
[2:03:42] whatever you know those uh uh for
[2:03:44] farmers do they do it
[2:03:47] in order in order to prepare that land
[2:03:51] to receive whatever seed that will be
[2:03:53] thrown
[2:04:08] amen and this is god's job to do
[2:04:11] i felt amen before he gives us his
[2:04:13] promise
[2:04:15] amen he knows exactly our response to
[2:04:18] the promise
[2:04:20] amen he knew it before the foundation of
[2:04:22] the world
[2:04:36] those promises will land in the good
[2:04:37] seed in the good ground
[2:04:40] and those promises will bring forth
[2:04:41] fruit
[2:04:44] and he is the one who does the work
[2:04:47] amen if you if you need more more proof
[2:04:49] you can we can go to ezekiel chapter 36.
[2:05:00] it's god who does the work he is the one
[2:05:03] who does the the work on the ground
[2:05:04] therefore
[2:05:07] ezekiel says in verse 36-37
[2:05:11] i mean chapter 36 verse 26 27.
[2:05:18] amen in other words ezekiel is giving
[2:05:19] this the this parable of jesus
[2:05:25] but now he is explaining to people how
[2:05:27] god will take somebody from you know
[2:05:30] would take a ground that's that had
[2:05:31] stones and thorns
[2:05:40] so that when the promise of god will it
[2:05:42] will hit that ground because the point
[2:05:43] is
[2:05:44] we'll bring forth first verse 26 the
[2:05:46] bible says
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:05:56] and i will take away the stony heart out
[2:05:58] of your flesh
[2:06:06] amen in other words that you know those
[2:06:08] i think the three the first three cases
[2:06:11] that jesus was talking in in chapter 13
[2:06:13] of matthew
[2:06:29] everything that will try to uh uh uh
[2:06:32] that would try to choke the word when
[2:06:34] the word will land in ivan
[2:06:38] and he will put in verse 27 say that and
[2:06:40] i will put my spirit within you
[2:06:53] in other words it's not your work it's
[2:06:54] not you working those judgments or it's
[2:06:57] not you working hard to keep those
[2:06:59] judgments
[2:07:02] amen it's the grace of god that god
[2:07:04] gives to anyone
[2:07:09] amen he gives you the promise
[2:07:12] and it gives you the grace that contact
[2:07:14] us to have faith the voila foreign amen
[2:07:16] he gives you the promise of zakat that
[2:07:18] promised amen and then he prepares the
[2:07:20] land
[2:07:21] amen so that when those promises will
[2:07:23] come
[2:07:25] the preparation that he did the
[2:07:27] preparation would cause you to work to
[2:07:30] walk in the statue
[2:07:32] don't say lord to keep the judge and to
[2:07:34] keep his judgment it observation
[2:07:37] them this is all
[2:07:38] amen so
[2:07:48] amen it's good to stay under the good
[2:07:50] atmosphere
[2:07:51] but your prayer will be your prayer
[2:07:53] shall be but lord just prepare that land
[2:07:55] inside of you
[2:07:58] amen lord just take away the stone of
[2:08:00] your heart
[2:08:03] and god give me the heart of flesh he
[2:08:05] said no i call the muslims
[2:08:10] amen will cause me to do your judgment
[2:08:13] to work in your statutes
[2:08:19] i mean to keep your judgment secure
[2:08:24] amen it's the heart of flesh that god
[2:08:26] will give you
[2:08:28] amen it's the revelation that god will
[2:08:30] give you
[2:08:32] the revelation of faith that god will
[2:08:33] give you that
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:09:05] so she didn't matter if people were
[2:09:07] keeping her from going from going to god
[2:09:09] in a particular situation
[2:09:12] you know she didn't matter if people
[2:09:13] were keeping her from touching
[2:09:17] amen she jesus
[2:09:18] care about touching jesus face
[2:09:21] oh touching jesus hands to shield the
[2:09:23] mountain but she had a face that was so
[2:09:25] strong
[2:09:26] unfortunately that's the lord even the
[2:09:28] helm of your garments
[2:09:30] amen just
[2:09:34] amen if you're not trying if you can't
[2:09:36] touch his face
[2:09:38] amen if you can't see his face super
[2:09:40] powerful because everybody's going to
[2:09:42] him
[2:09:44] you just have a promise of god who is
[2:09:46] sympathetic
[2:09:47] to your goal
[2:09:48] say lord even the hand of your
[2:09:51] government is it to your memory
[2:09:53] lord even your share the lord
[2:09:56] lord even though
[2:09:57] as long as i'm under your shadow
[2:10:09] amen you just have to have faith
[2:10:12] amen faith
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:27] amen this was talking about his healing
[2:10:31] you know of of of of of seeing the
[2:10:34] seventh dove
[2:10:37] so now here we understand one thing i
[2:10:39] discovered when i was listening to this
[2:10:41] message uh on the winds of the snow
[2:10:43] white now
[2:10:46] when the prophet was giving the
[2:10:48] testimony of being healed
[2:10:53] technically it wasn't healed when he was
[2:10:55] giving that program when he was giving
[2:10:57] that testimony
[2:11:02] he saw the vision
[2:11:04] but he wasn't healed yet
[2:11:08] but he saw the vision so sure
[2:11:12] that he knew that his healing will be
[2:11:14] welcomed
[2:11:15] soon
[2:11:17] amen so that's why he was standing and
[2:11:19] giving the testimony
[2:11:22] amen because
[2:11:35] you know that that seventh that was
[2:11:37] coming with his with with uh uh uh he's
[2:11:39] he's healing
[2:11:41] so that's why he created me that's why
[2:11:42] he stood before people
[2:11:45] i told them about the and testify we
[2:11:47] started to testify about his healing
[2:11:49] yeah
[2:11:50] man
[2:12:15] and then the promise will be and then
[2:12:17] that he will have his healing
[2:12:20] amen
[2:12:22] and then and the prophet says
[2:12:25] where did the dove come from
[2:12:28] up there in the wilderness
[2:12:30] i'll say this
[2:12:32] god said abraham needed a ring for his
[2:12:34] son
[2:12:38] he is jehovah
[2:12:41] the lord can provide for himself the
[2:12:42] sacrifice
[2:12:46] you think of it
[2:12:51] the same god remember but the same
[2:12:53] inspiration
[2:12:55] by the same kind of people

[2:13:46] faith in my heart
[2:13:48] to believe that i'm going to be here
[2:13:51] it meant to believe that i will have
[2:13:53] research for my questions
[2:13:57] a man to believe that i will have a
[2:13:59] result for
[2:14:00] any equation that i have
[2:14:04] a man to believe that every need that i
[2:14:06] have will be provided
[2:14:10] amen you pray for that revelation
[2:14:13] you don't have to force yourself to
[2:14:15] agree with it
[2:14:17] amen no matter how good the word sounds
[2:14:21] no matter how that word brings emotion
[2:14:23] to your spirit

[2:14:43] spirit will feel like very important

[2:27:09] like you can improve because we have a
[2:27:11] responsibility over our bodies
[2:27:14] over our over our souls over our
[2:27:16] families over our positions
[2:27:18] amen so that every part of our life
[2:27:21] would bring honor and glory
[2:27:24] to the body of the lord jesus christ
[2:27:26] it's our responsibility as a part of the
[2:27:28] body of christ amen and
[2:27:31] i just wanted to announce you know last
[2:27:33] year i began
[2:27:34] praying in a specific direction for my
[2:27:37] life
[2:27:38] and uh asking the lord to change some
[2:27:40] things
[2:27:42] amen is
[2:27:43] looking at uh
[2:27:45] things that are going on in my life and
[2:27:48] busyness and
[2:27:50] some chaos that entered in
[2:27:53] just
[2:27:53] ask the lord to come in and make a
[2:27:55] change
[2:27:57] amen and as i began to pray that way
[2:27:59] some
[2:28:00] things began to move
[2:28:02] just as our brother says when you
[2:28:05] when you lay your case at calvary
[2:28:09] heaven begins to move on your behalf
[2:28:11] amen as i begin to pray now as i look
[2:28:14] back through time over the last year i
[2:28:16] can see that things began to move
[2:28:19] and so i want to announce that uh i have
[2:28:21] accepted a job out of state um
[2:28:24] state of michigan
[2:28:27] we will be leaving the church here
[2:28:30] probably
[2:28:31] sometime around the first of the year
[2:28:34] it's a
[2:28:35] not an easy decision to make
[2:28:37] been here
[2:28:38] for
[2:28:40] probably 18 years or so since the church
[2:28:42] started since brother keith invited me
[2:28:44] to the bible studies
[2:28:46] we've
[2:28:46] enjoyed our time here
[2:28:49] brother isaiah has been my pastor since
[2:28:50] 2007.
[2:28:52] uh it's not a decision i take lightly
[2:28:56] my love for brother isaiah has
[2:28:59] no bounds
[2:29:01] god gave him to me as a pastor
[2:29:04] i've enjoyed every moment of it
[2:29:07] and uh respect him and this church is
[2:29:10] a place that god has chosen here in this
[2:29:12] area
[2:29:13] to hold up the banner of jesus christ
[2:29:16] you know and as i see the you know
[2:29:19] wondering as i
[2:29:21] see myself moving on from this place
[2:29:24] it does bring me a lot of joy to see our
[2:29:26] brothers that have risen up
[2:29:28] musicians
[2:29:30] ministers
[2:29:31] song leaders
[2:29:35] years ago i would have wondered you know
[2:29:37] well i felt it felt like i was
[2:29:39] abandoning the church but now i see that
[2:29:40] god has risen up all these young men to
[2:29:43] take these
[2:29:44] these different roles and places and i
[2:29:46] know the church is in a good place
[2:29:48] amen so i just i just wanted to uh make
[2:29:51] this announcement
[2:29:53] as
[2:29:55] didn't want anybody to be left out
[2:29:57] amen
[2:29:59] my wife and i our family were
[2:30:01] in the process of buying a house there
[2:30:03] in michigan we're
[2:30:05] working on getting rid of our house here
[2:30:06] in iowa
[2:30:08] we'll probably making a lot of trips
[2:30:10] back and forth you'll probably see less
[2:30:11] and less of us as we
[2:30:13] try to spend part of our time there and
[2:30:15] part of our time here
[2:30:16] but we'll definitely be here through
[2:30:18] through january so

[2:30:23] every single person in this place i love
[2:30:25] and enjoy
[2:30:26] i've enjoyed our fellowship and
[2:30:31] i just want to thank god for every
[2:30:32] single one of you
[2:30:34] not one person here that i have anything
[2:30:36] against
[2:30:37] any any oughts
[2:30:39] any any funny feelings i love every
[2:30:42] single one as a member of the body of
[2:30:43] christ

[2:30:48] support our great pastor that god has
[2:30:50] given us
[2:30:51] and uh
[2:30:52] it's not a goodbye it's just a
[2:30:57] looking forward to see what god has amen
[2:31:00] as i've said you can see god's hand in
[2:31:02] it all i've seen some
[2:31:04] supernatural signs and a little bit of
[2:31:07] leadings here and there as you know how
[2:31:08] god does

[2:31:16] where the camp meetings just took place
[2:31:18] there in michigan
[2:31:20] and
[2:31:20] they right at this moment don't have a
[2:31:22] pastor so
[2:31:24] we'll definitely be keeping that keep
[2:31:26] that in your prayers and god will give
[2:31:27] them a pastor after god's own heart i
[2:31:29] know i'll be
[2:31:30] praying that direction as well so
