[37:58] amen this is the slow night
[38:02] but you're more than welcome amen and uh
[38:06] we appreciate everybody that comes out

[38:09] gospel God gives us
[38:11] a little more grace
[38:14] amen don't uh if as you see I I'll just
[38:18] leave that alone but you know I just

[38:34] we appreciate everybody
[38:38] Mark the third chapter
[38:43] you met brother Frank brother Frank is a
[38:45] real good brother
[38:47] yeah so
[38:50] he's precious
[38:52] he's a song leader too
[38:59] I didn't say yeah to whatever you said I
[39:01] was just
[39:01] [Laughter]
[39:05] amen we're going to ask that you turn
[39:07] with us to Mark the third chapter which
[39:09] um
[39:10] you know we've been really praying
[39:13] for God to give us a real Revival
[39:18] I'm not talking about the shouting and
[39:20] the dancing and the speaking in tongues
[39:21] and all of the things that everybody
[39:22] consider that consider as a Revival but
[39:26] in reality Revival is getting the trash
[39:29] out of your lives
[39:31] once you can get the trash out of your
[39:33] lifeguard can then fill you with the
[39:35] spirit
[39:36] and then he can use you as a real clean
[39:40] Sanctified vessel
[39:43] but we understand that in this age it
[39:46] doesn't come easy
[39:49] you've got to fight for it
[39:52] you've got to fight
[39:55] every devil that there is to
[39:58] get a hold of God
[40:00] and God ordained it to be so
[40:03] if you truly want the true Holy Spirit
[40:06] the true God of the Old and New
[40:08] Testament
[40:09] in this day
[40:11] you're going to have to look beyond all
[40:13] creeds dogmas
[40:15] all systems
[40:18] everything that appeared to be Christian
[40:21] you find God in his word
[40:24] Mark the third chapter
[40:26] beginning at the 23rd verse we'll read
[40:29] 23 to 27.
[40:33] and I trust by God's grace that he will
[40:35] give me the opportunity to at least get
[40:38] the meat of what I want to say out
[40:41] tonight without keeping you so long
[40:45] uh because I realize amen that
[40:48] a lot of things will be said by God's
[40:50] grace and I trust that you know that
[40:52] you'll be blessed mark
[40:54] 3 23 and he called them unto him and
[40:58] said unto them
[41:00] in parables
[41:02] how can Satan cast out Satan
[41:08] if a kingdom be divided against itself
[41:11] that Kingdom cannot stand
[41:15] and if a house be divided against itself
[41:19] that house
[41:21] cannot stand now the word house
[41:25] can be used as your own home your own
[41:29] house but it also can be mean a nation
[41:32] it could also fit into uh you know
[41:36] people say I'm I'm a Baptist I'm a
[41:38] method I'm a president I'm this now uh
[41:41] but how can it stand
[41:43] if it be divided
[41:46] and if Satan rise up against himself
[41:50] and be divided
[41:52] he cannot stand
[41:54] but hath and in so you understand what
[41:58] division does
[41:59] it literally brings things to an end
[42:04] no man can enter
[42:06] into the strong man
[42:09] house
[42:11] and spoil his Goods except
[42:15] he with first buying the strong man
[42:20] and then he was spoiled his house
[42:25] Matthew 20 excuse me Matthew 12 28
[42:29] through 30.
[42:36] Jesus speaking but if I cast out Devils
[42:40] by the spirit of God because remember In
[42:43] this passage of scripture they called
[42:44] him Beelzebub they called him the devil
[42:47] but if I cast out Devils by the spirit
[42:49] of God then the kingdom of God is come
[42:52] unto you
[42:55] or else how can one enter into a strong
[42:58] man's house
[43:00] spoil is good
[43:01] except he first buying the strong man
[43:05] and then he will spoiled his good his
[43:08] house excuse me
[43:09] he that is not with me is against me
[43:12] and he that gathereth not with me
[43:15] scattereth abroad
[43:18] isn't that something
[43:20] one more scripture
[43:23] Luke 12
[43:25] 51 53
[43:30] I suppose you that I come to give
[43:34] I suppose that I am come to give peace
[43:37] on Earth
[43:39] I tell you nay
[43:42] but rather division
[43:45] for which from his Force there shall be
[43:47] five in one house
[43:49] divided three against two
[43:53] and two against three
[43:57] the father shall be divided against the
[44:00] son
[44:01] and the son against the father
[44:03] the mother against the daughter
[44:06] and the daughter against the mother
[44:08] the Mother-in-law against her
[44:10] daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law
[44:12] against her mother-in-law
[44:15] let's pray
[44:17] Heavenly Father God we come before you
[44:20] we thank you for your grace and your
[44:22] mercy and we thank you for being so good
[44:25] to us
[44:26] Lord we thank you God for being so good
[44:28] to us we pray father that you would
[44:31] bless the service in a special way move
[44:34] me completely out of your way Lord
[44:36] have thine own way and speak to your
[44:38] people the words Hallelujah that you
[44:41] would have them to hear in your name
[44:43] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[44:47] seated
[44:49] I don't know whether or not our sister
[44:51] Joanne is listening in
[44:53] when God gave me this message I had no
[44:56] idea what you were going to go through
[44:59] but I will say that when we preach that
[45:01] message about the unexpected
[45:04] uh attack of the enemy the unexpected
[45:07] battle
[45:08] and how we ought to behave when these
[45:11] things do take place
[45:13] you see because a battle take us
[45:15] unexpectedly it doesn't mean that we
[45:17] loses the battle
[45:19] because every battle is ordained by God
[45:23] and God expect us to win these battles
[45:26] but you can't win the battle until you
[45:28] learn how to trust the word
[45:31] when you trust God God will fight your
[45:35] battle
[45:36] you understand me
[45:37] my subject tonight is the power of the
[45:40] family
[45:41] now I know that sounds strange but just
[45:44] give me a time or two and I'll try to
[45:46] bring you to a place where Satan has
[45:48] been hiding himself
[45:51] because the family in itself is one of
[45:54] God's institutions
[45:55] you know the church is and we call it
[45:57] church family we call each other
[45:58] brothers we call each other sisters but
[46:02] in the beginning when God made Adam and
[46:04] Eve Adam and Eve was the family of God
[46:06] and then from Adam and Eve was to Spring
[46:09] Offspring which would have been for Adam
[46:12] and Eve's family which would have been
[46:14] the family of God it's always been that
[46:17] way God had a family he was a father you
[46:22] can't be a father without having
[46:23] offspring so we realize by the grace of
[46:26] God that when we when it comes to these
[46:28] things you and I must understand because
[46:31] of the Fall got Calvary was all about
[46:35] restoring the family of God
[46:39] right even the Bible said the whole
[46:41] Heaven and Earth the family of God is
[46:45] named after him
[46:47] now Adam and Eve and then their family
[46:51] but we know what happened the serpent
[46:53] came in and he broke what did he do
[46:56] divide it
[46:58] the family divided Adam and Eve now you
[47:02] got to hear what I'm saying because I'm
[47:04] gonna tell you that's what has happened
[47:05] to America that's why we see the chaos
[47:08] that we see now because Satan was smart
[47:13] and shrewd and he knew how to break the
[47:18] backbone of the nation
[47:20] and he did just that and now because of
[47:24] what he did and because of what we
[47:26] allowed him to do this is why we see
[47:29] chaos everywhere and he's not finished
[47:32] with it either
[47:35] this season that we are now living in is
[47:38] so broken with distrust and jealousies
[47:42] and hatred
[47:44] even amongst families is that right I
[47:48] mean how did that happen I can remember
[47:50] in my day family was family yeah you can
[47:54] fall off or you'll fall back in Mama
[47:57] made sure you did it say you're sorry
[48:00] and those things we had to do
[48:04] but because of what Satan has done
[48:09] families are now killing one another
[48:11] without any remorse
[48:15] but God comes to restore his family
[48:19] and he starts with trust
[48:24] because that's you say well you know
[48:26] trust is something else she says have
[48:29] faith in God well you can't have faith
[48:31] in God till you trust God
[48:34] and Trust bring you into believing God
[48:38] or believing in him
[48:41] right amen Faith uh have faith and do
[48:47] you believe in me
[48:49] is what Jesus says
[48:52] right because that's what happened even
[48:55] when God told Adam and Eve don't eat of
[48:57] the tree don't do this no doubt Adam
[49:00] told Eve
[49:01] and Satan came and he broke her faith in
[49:05] her own husband
[49:06] and when he broke the faith in the
[49:08] husband he broke the belief and
[49:11] therefore when he when belief is is is
[49:14] is is is broken you know what believing
[49:16] is when I say I believe that means I'm
[49:19] agreeing with you I'm in an agreement
[49:23] with you hey and once that agreement is
[49:26] broken then Satan comes in and brings
[49:29] division
[49:32] and he knows how to work in our minds
[49:36] to bring in unbelief
[49:40] because unbelief is the only true sin
[49:43] right sin in itself is unbelief unbelief
[49:47] in what unbelief in God unbelief in the
[49:51] word and right now it is what our nation
[49:55] and the world is trying to get rid of
[49:58] the Bible trying to get rid of the word
[50:00] trying to get rid of Christians who
[50:03] believe in the word
[50:05] but Satan has failed
[50:07] before he started
[50:09] because God has already established
[50:12] everybody amen that that will make bride
[50:17] you know we're living in a day and we in
[50:20] such a chaotic age and you know the
[50:22] Bible says according to Amos he says I
[50:24] will I will not do anything except I
[50:27] show it to my servant the prophet amen
[50:30] Amos 3 7. and you know it's amazing
[50:33] because we don't even see that the world
[50:35] is about to end
[50:37] everything I just saw on the on a a
[50:41] report uh yesterday how Russia and China
[50:47] had ships a hundred miles out of Los
[50:51] Angeles
[50:53] checking us out
[50:55] ready for the battle
[50:57] and people don't understand that the
[51:00] world can't take another battle not
[51:03] atomic
[51:05] Hallelujah but they fail to see it must
[51:08] happen it's got to happen it's just one
[51:12] of those things that is preeminent
[51:15] we don't know the exact day and it's
[51:17] going to happen but it's going to happen
[51:20] why is it
[51:22] a few months ago maybe of a year a year
[51:25] ago after the after the covet
[51:28] because Eternal Genesis 6.
[51:32] and I turned to Genesis 6 and Genesis 6
[51:34] talks about how violence
[51:37] was all through the land
[51:40] just before the flood
[51:43] you understand me violence men hating
[51:46] one another right and listen we we know
[51:50] by God's grace that that the the
[51:52] prejudices that we're now experiencing
[51:55] has never been color
[51:58] they make it a color now
[52:00] but in all nations
[52:02] All Nations it has always been Tribal
[52:06] wars
[52:08] it's about what tribe you belong to
[52:13] even Israel
[52:15] they had 12 tribes and they fought each
[52:18] other
[52:19] when they were supposed to be United
[52:21] y'all understand what I'm saying so the
[52:24] devil knows how to bring division by
[52:28] pointing out something that's little and
[52:31] a little difference
[52:33] that's all he needs a little difference
[52:35] it meant to break up the house
[52:40] that's what he does
[52:43] even among Every Nation whether you're
[52:46] black white yellow green purple with it
[52:48] don't make no difference if you have
[52:50] different tribals
[52:52] tribes
[52:53] one thing they're better than the next
[52:57] how did that happen
[53:00] right
[53:01] it was Satan
[53:05] Satan who made one think
[53:08] that the other one was better than the
[53:11] next y'all don't maybe you don't hear me
[53:14] but all of this is to keep Mankind from
[53:17] uniting
[53:20] now that I think about it even in the
[53:23] days of old
[53:25] right after the flood
[53:28] men saw one another as being the same
[53:34] and they built a towel they were on one
[53:37] mind one Accord and had not God stopped
[53:40] them they would have built a tower up to
[53:43] the heavens
[53:45] is that right
[53:47] but God said never again
[53:51] hallelujah what did he do he confused
[53:54] the other languages
[53:56] and he knew that Satan would take
[53:58] opportunity
[54:00] in that to make one think that they're
[54:03] better than the other
[54:04] he not only stopped that but we had the
[54:08] Continental Divide
[54:09] and God began to break up the land mass
[54:13] put one here put one there put them here
[54:16] and put them there and he did all of
[54:18] that
[54:19] because he knew Satan was the author of
[54:22] confusion
[54:24] Hallelujah now oh y'all come on now you
[54:27] know it's true
[54:29] and then what what they say did Satan do
[54:31] when when there was just tribal laws and
[54:33] people were still trying to come
[54:35] together to be one and then he he
[54:37] brought in this uh damnable hearsay that
[54:41] we all came from monkeys
[54:46] and that was the Divide us even more
[54:50] it's the truth because he knows that
[54:53] when you get mad on one Accord
[54:56] he's capable of doing any and everything
[55:00] now let me you know I I didn't even go I
[55:03] didn't even intend to go that far
[55:04] [Laughter]
[55:06] but you see where I'm going with
[55:09] let me show you the institution of
[55:11] marriage
[55:12] a marriage ceremony is really based upon
[55:15] trust and love
[55:19] you can't say well it's based on beauty
[55:21] because you'll find some couples and you
[55:23] wonder where and how it happened
[55:27] because you might find one man that he
[55:29] may be handsome other he might be ugly
[55:31] and the woman might be beautiful
[55:34] and you look at that like how
[55:38] but you see it's mystical
[55:41] it's a mystery
[55:43] it's somehow when God put two together
[55:46] and they know it that they know that
[55:48] they know
[55:49] are automatic Trust
[55:52] comes and you don't even know where it
[55:55] came from
[56:01] love her well she been good to me
[56:04] she's Rich she's pretty you can give all
[56:08] of those answers and every
[56:11] everyone will be wrong
[56:13] the best answer to that is I don't know
[56:16] why I love her I just know I do
[56:20] right
[56:22] it's not it's unconditional they're not
[56:25] circumstances there to say I love you
[56:28] because if you say I love her because
[56:30] she gives me gifts every year well what
[56:32] happens when she stops
[56:35] see that that that's not real
[56:38] but you find a couple or individual and
[56:41] somehow they connect in a way they don't
[56:43] even understand it how it happens but
[56:46] they know it's real
[56:48] Hallelujah and you find the trust
[56:53] it's true
[56:54] trust and believing
[56:57] right
[56:59] you know it's amazing because maybe I've
[57:02] been a little bit too liberal but I'll
[57:04] say when it comes to my wife I've never
[57:06] distrusted her when it comes to another
[57:09] man
[57:11] it never it just you know
[57:14] uh uh I can remember I backed that up I
[57:18] remember I didn't distrust her but I
[57:20] remember there was a little jealousy
[57:21] about a one fella but anyway
[57:24] I don't want to embarrass you either
[57:26] but you see the thing was it wasn't it
[57:29] wasn't her it was me
[57:31] you understand what I'm saying
[57:33] I'm saying but then
[57:34] God knocked on this block one day and
[57:37] woke me up
[57:38] she
[57:43] probably about no idea what I'm talking
[57:44] about but anyhow
[57:46] God brought me through that little error
[57:48] in my mind
[57:50] marriage ceremonies are based upon trust
[57:53] Than Love
[57:56] you know I mean it's something about
[57:58] this trust well trust and love goes
[58:00] together you know it's a key
[58:02] it's something that clicks you together
[58:05] and you don't even know how it happened
[58:07] or you don't know why it happened and
[58:09] when it happened but it happened I'm
[58:11] saying something here
[58:12] because you got to understand that what
[58:15] Adam felt for Eve
[58:17] wasn't based upon how good looking she
[58:20] was
[58:21] when I guarantee she was probably the
[58:23] best woman of the most beautifulest
[58:25] woman ever formed because she was the
[58:27] number one
[58:28] it wasn't her beauty
[58:31] but it was something he trusted and he
[58:34] loved her so much until he knew he
[58:36] couldn't live without her
[58:39] now I'm coming to something
[58:42] because she's pretty because she's Rich
[58:43] because she's kind she did this she did
[58:46] that and all of that runs out
[58:50] all wrong answers
[58:52] see I love her because I love her and I
[58:55] don't know why I love her love is a
[58:58] mystery it is an agreement to agree
[59:01] is that I do I do
[59:06] you see what I'm saying I trust you with
[59:09] all my heart
[59:12] don't you ever marry someone you cannot
[59:16] trust with all your heart
[59:21] well I feel I might not well you better
[59:24] not if you feel that you might not you
[59:26] understand what I'm saying because it's
[59:28] got to be a mutual thing it's got to be
[59:31] a connection that that that you cannot
[59:34] explain
[59:36] people said love at first sight I
[59:38] believe in that
[59:40] but it ain't just that I would
[59:42] appearance the individuals are in love
[59:44] with is somehow they connect with your
[59:46] inner man because it's really
[59:48] Supernatural
[59:52] Satan tactic is to divide and conquer
[59:56] the home
[59:57] he knows that the house divided can't
[1:00:01] stand
[1:00:02] listen if all of America homes if they
[1:00:06] would all mothers and fathers sisters
[1:00:08] and brothers would get together and
[1:00:10] confess and say forgive me I love you
[1:00:13] it'll straighten the nation out
[1:00:16] everything will be straightened
[1:00:19] Satan would be defeated because he'll
[1:00:22] never have at that point he has no
[1:00:24] Avenue no place to enter in to divide
[1:00:33] see that's the kind of trust God wants
[1:00:35] to have with us
[1:00:37] a trust that he knows that you're going
[1:00:40] to remain a virgin unto him and that
[1:00:42] you're not going to allow Satan
[1:00:45] to to to to to come in with some kind of
[1:00:47] Lie to make you disbelieve his word you
[1:00:51] hear what I'm saying
[1:00:52] it's it's I love him and if I love him I
[1:00:57] believe every word he says even though I
[1:01:00] don't understand it all I believe it all
[1:01:06] and that's what he said
[1:01:08] and in this day do you think
[1:01:11] I come to bring peace
[1:01:13] he says no I come to bring sword why
[1:01:16] because everybody here is not mine
[1:01:21] I come Amen to divide houses because
[1:01:25] everybody in the house is not mine
[1:01:30] you say what
[1:01:31] go down to Jericho
[1:01:34] there's a woman over there
[1:01:38] right
[1:01:39] all the Jericho is not mine but God came
[1:01:43] in and all of a sudden there was a
[1:01:45] division
[1:01:47] see God brings the word as well he
[1:01:50] separate the right from the wrong
[1:01:53] but Satan brings in confusion
[1:01:59] the strong man has to be bound
[1:02:02] and in this case the strong man is Satan
[1:02:05] he's the devil and God is willing to
[1:02:08] come in and cast him out
[1:02:11] spoil his Goods
[1:02:13] make him ashamed
[1:02:15] he thought he had
[1:02:18] what he had
[1:02:20] but what he had is no longer his
[1:02:23] now you say well brother books where are
[1:02:25] you going with this
[1:02:28] when the families mothers and fathers
[1:02:32] y'all know that's true right
[1:02:34] everybody is gone
[1:02:37] All Families almost every family I know
[1:02:40] is going
[1:02:41] everybody going every way
[1:02:43] but this way
[1:02:45] the unity
[1:02:46] of the family is almost gone
[1:02:50] there was a time husbands and wives and
[1:02:53] children sat down together and had Bible
[1:02:56] studies taught them talked about the
[1:02:58] Lord you know what I mean it was
[1:02:59] god-centered
[1:03:02] but Satan knew he could not allow this
[1:03:04] to remain
[1:03:06] so what did he do he brought the
[1:03:08] television we kicked that out
[1:03:11] he brought the iPad the the
[1:03:14] he kept working it
[1:03:17] and now even the families are more
[1:03:20] interested
[1:03:22] listen I've seen it happen I was at
[1:03:25] Gray's Lake one time and he was a
[1:03:26] husband and wife on a boat
[1:03:29] supposed to be a love affair a little
[1:03:31] sweet Audi she had her back turned and
[1:03:33] she was on her phone and he was on his
[1:03:35] phone and the boat was just moving by
[1:03:37] itself what was that you see the
[1:03:40] division they don't even know it
[1:03:44] what did covet do
[1:03:46] when people who had not mothers and
[1:03:49] fathers who hadn't seen each other
[1:03:51] probably in a long time because they're
[1:03:53] always working
[1:03:54] one worked the ship that works it's just
[1:03:57] trick of the enemy so when Kobe came and
[1:03:59] they had to be in the same house they
[1:04:01] couldn't get a loan
[1:04:03] brought a lot of divorces did y'all know
[1:04:06] that
[1:04:08] see but the devil knows what he's what
[1:04:10] are you saying these things for if we're
[1:04:13] going to have a Revival in this church
[1:04:15] it must start with the families
[1:04:19] families must pull themselves together
[1:04:22] and realize the world is more important
[1:04:25] than anything else
[1:04:27] absolutely I'm guilty
[1:04:32] but I'm willing to repent
[1:04:36] pining the strong man right
[1:04:40] listen
[1:04:41] they tell us listen it's in the word we
[1:04:43] never thought we'll see this day Mothers
[1:04:46] Against fathers fathers again mother
[1:04:47] sisters against Brothers against this
[1:04:49] everybody's against everybody guess what
[1:04:52] and they probably don't even know wow
[1:04:57] I don't trust this one why you don't
[1:04:59] trust him I don't believe that why you
[1:05:01] don't believe because you have a lack of
[1:05:03] Love especially when the person is
[1:05:05] telling you the truth
[1:05:08] second Corinthians says for though we
[1:05:10] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:05:13] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:05:16] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[1:05:18] the pulling down of strongholds what are
[1:05:21] you saying remember that sister her
[1:05:24] husband was an alcoholic
[1:05:26] and she was a real devout Christian love
[1:05:29] the Lord
[1:05:30] and her husband went out with the boys
[1:05:31] and her husband told them uh uh they
[1:05:35] said oh man ah hey these Christians he
[1:05:38] ain't no such thing as Christian that
[1:05:39] one drunk says wait a minute
[1:05:41] if there ain't nothing but one I know
[1:05:43] who she is
[1:05:45] and he says my wife is a Christian what
[1:05:47] a testimony for a drunkard to give about
[1:05:50] his wife that his wife and listen
[1:05:53] they're divided
[1:05:55] but she still trusts him
[1:05:57] she still loves him just the way he is
[1:06:01] if somebody help me and the truth of the
[1:06:03] matter is a man says oh come on home
[1:06:06] they came home and he says listen we're
[1:06:08] going to put it to the test watch what I
[1:06:10] do honey come get me some food
[1:06:13] I think she fixing some eggs and stuff
[1:06:16] and then she brought the eggs and said
[1:06:18] he's just acting super drunk you know I
[1:06:22] don't like my eggs like that fix them
[1:06:25] over
[1:06:26] what she do she knelt on that floor and
[1:06:29] she began to pick up those eggs but she
[1:06:31] had Jesus in her mind
[1:06:33] Hallelujah she knew what the word says
[1:06:38] Hallelujah he was obedient to the word
[1:06:41] amen and she said she began to sing must
[1:06:44] Jesus bear the cross alone and all the
[1:06:49] world go free no there's a cross for
[1:06:52] everyone and there's a cross for me
[1:06:56] Hallelujah guess what her husband got
[1:06:59] saved in all of his buddies
[1:07:01] see all you got to do is be salty
[1:07:04] Hallelujah allow God to keep the unity
[1:07:08] of the spirit and the bond of Peace
[1:07:12] that's what we're here for the Bible
[1:07:14] says amen that the world will know us by
[1:07:17] the love that we have one toward another
[1:07:20] we don't fight against flesh and blood
[1:07:24] but spiritual wickedness in her places
[1:07:26] is that right you know we can't just you
[1:07:30] know people say well I I just you know
[1:07:32] Bob says casting down listen the weapon
[1:07:35] of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[1:07:38] through God to the pulling down of
[1:07:39] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:07:43] and every High thing that exalt itself
[1:07:45] and that's the thing it seemed like
[1:07:47] everybody when they get saved all of a
[1:07:48] sudden they got the spirit of
[1:07:49] discernment
[1:07:53] hey and that's all you can do is discern
[1:07:55] bad spirit and you better check your
[1:07:57] discernment
[1:07:58] because discernment discerns everything
[1:08:02] right it's up against the knowledge of
[1:08:05] God and bring into a captivity every
[1:08:07] thought to The Obedience of Christ I
[1:08:09] know you said but brother Brooks just
[1:08:11] seem like it's off the wall but you know
[1:08:12] what somebody need this
[1:08:16] and it's going to somebody
[1:08:18] that somebody might just be me you
[1:08:20] understand me because listen I'm seeing
[1:08:23] things I've never seen before
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:28] precious brother gave me this scripture
[1:08:30] and I told him I said I'm going to use
[1:08:31] this thing Psalms 23 5-7
[1:08:35] dial prepares the table before me in the
[1:08:38] presence of my enemy
[1:08:42] God set you up
[1:08:46] for the battle
[1:08:48] in the presence of your enemy
[1:08:50] thou anointed my hair with oil my cup
[1:08:54] Running Oh see God don't put you in a
[1:08:56] battle without anointing you
[1:08:59] the anointing comes as well as the
[1:09:01] battle
[1:09:03] but this is the part that I like
[1:09:05] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:09:07] me
[1:09:09] they ain't going to go before you
[1:09:11] it ain't coming with you
[1:09:13] it's coming after you
[1:09:16] follow you no matter what you go through
[1:09:19] his goodness and mercy is coming when
[1:09:23] you think you're in a dark Valley when
[1:09:25] you think that the battle has been been
[1:09:27] won by the enemy here come God
[1:09:31] that's the way it is
[1:09:33] you say oh no brother yes it is when
[1:09:37] Israel thought they had to
[1:09:38] had lost to the Battle of of of with the
[1:09:41] Philistines he'd come a little boy with
[1:09:44] carrots and biscuits and whatever more
[1:09:46] he was carrying to his brothers is that
[1:09:48] right they thought it was all over
[1:09:50] Goliath had won and here come a little
[1:09:54] fella who trusts the Lord is that right
[1:09:57] and that's what David said trust the
[1:09:59] Lord with all your heart and lean not to
[1:10:03] your own understanding you acknowledge
[1:10:05] Him and He will direct your path that's
[1:10:09] it
[1:10:12] no matter how big the devil is he ain't
[1:10:15] big enough
[1:10:17] you understand me your God my God Amen
[1:10:20] he is a defeater he is a giant slayer
[1:10:24] Hallelujah there's not a civilization
[1:10:27] that man has built that could withstand
[1:10:31] the judgments of God
[1:10:33] Hallelujah Egypt couldn't do it Rome
[1:10:37] couldn't do it Creek couldn't do it
[1:10:40] amen I'm sure there are others but my
[1:10:43] point is every one of them that thought
[1:10:46] they were so great and that they could
[1:10:48] outsmart God where are they now
[1:10:52] I don't care how great this country is
[1:10:55] it'll never be able to outsmart God
[1:10:59] when you challenge God which we have
[1:11:03] boy we got it coming
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:09] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:11:11] me all the days of my life and I would
[1:11:14] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:11:16] David apologizing for cutting the
[1:11:19] Garment of Saul
[1:11:21] right
[1:11:22] he could have killed him
[1:11:24] but he didn't right it's amazing how we
[1:11:28] can say and do things to one another and
[1:11:30] think God is not watching hello he's
[1:11:33] watching everything he's even taking
[1:11:35] down your thoughts right now is being
[1:11:37] recorded on your position and your
[1:11:40] attitude and everything else about the
[1:11:42] word of God hallelujah
[1:11:46] foreign
[1:11:48] this is the turn right
[1:11:50] and and listen you it's amazing what an
[1:11:53] apology would do and I find out that
[1:11:55] there are so many Christians I can't
[1:11:56] apologize what are you talking about uh
[1:11:59] forgiveness what are you saying you
[1:12:01] can't forgive
[1:12:03] you need a real baptism of the Holy
[1:12:05] Ghost
[1:12:10] if you can't forgive that means God
[1:12:12] can't forgive you
[1:12:14] but brother but you don't know what I've
[1:12:15] gone through hey I don't need to know
[1:12:18] what you're going through
[1:12:20] everybody's going through something and
[1:12:22] some people worse than what you going
[1:12:24] through
[1:12:25] Hallelujah but the beauty of it is that
[1:12:28] God didn't choose them he chose you
[1:12:33] what a mighty God we serve Hallelujah
[1:12:36] I'm doing everything but shouting up
[1:12:38] here folks I'm in my spirit he's moving
[1:12:40] this way and moving that way
[1:12:44] God is good God is good God is good see
[1:12:48] what is it it's amazing how jealous he
[1:12:51] can bring a person down
[1:12:54] you know jealousy was brought on by the
[1:12:56] church people you know
[1:12:58] during David's time
[1:13:01] jealousy you know that's why it's not
[1:13:03] good to praise people
[1:13:05] oh brother so-and-so you're so good oh
[1:13:08] brother it's all right to comment them
[1:13:10] at time but don't overdo it
[1:13:12] the flesh is weak
[1:13:14] he get lifted he get puffed up
[1:13:17] y'all know it's true I don't like too
[1:13:20] much of it because it hinders my
[1:13:21] preaching and sometimes it hinders my
[1:13:23] singing people don't understand what I
[1:13:25] work through Amen to get God's glory to
[1:13:28] come down
[1:13:32] yeah I just want to hear him say Well
[1:13:34] done
[1:13:36] right
[1:13:38] hey me and a brother was talking about
[1:13:39] says yeah David says you know can you
[1:13:42] imagine
[1:13:44] they're having a wonderful church
[1:13:46] service and all of a sudden you know how
[1:13:48] they break out in the chair
[1:13:52] and he said saw a thousand and David
[1:13:58] oh my goodness and I'm the king
[1:14:01] he's the king you know Saul's the king
[1:14:03] and you know you're praising the member
[1:14:05] of the church you're giving him more
[1:14:06] Glory
[1:14:07] see it didn't bother David
[1:14:10] why did it bother Saul
[1:14:13] because Saul was carnal
[1:14:16] jealousy right can be it can be a wicked
[1:14:20] inspiration it is a wicked especially if
[1:14:22] it's the wrong kind of Godly jealousy is
[1:14:24] one thing but when it's jealousy against
[1:14:27] your brothers or jealousy against your
[1:14:28] sister you know that is so wicked and
[1:14:32] literally it divides the church
[1:14:36] being divided don't doesn't matter it
[1:14:39] does when Jesus was getting ready to
[1:14:41] raise up Tabitha amen he put all the
[1:14:44] unbelievers out
[1:14:46] all of them
[1:14:48] get out
[1:14:50] why because he knew A House Divided
[1:14:52] can't stand
[1:14:54] normally that's what happens when you go
[1:14:57] to church and somebody's trying to get
[1:14:58] God want to heal them they can't heal
[1:15:00] them because you got unbelievers we
[1:15:02] believe us
[1:15:04] and that unbelieving Spirit hinders God
[1:15:07] God loves one Accord nest and he doesn't
[1:15:11] care if it's two or three because he
[1:15:13] said if you gather in my name two or
[1:15:16] three right that's what you will and it
[1:15:19] shall be given it's not the mass the
[1:15:21] multitude
[1:15:24] you know what we need to start saying
[1:15:26] those who don't believe y'all can go
[1:15:30] you can be excused
[1:15:35] right division is something else
[1:15:38] and what we don't realize is that
[1:15:40] division just didn't start here it was
[1:15:42] in heaven Lucifer divided the church in
[1:15:46] heaven
[1:15:47] that's why we got angels and that's how
[1:15:50] we got demons demons followed Lucifer
[1:15:53] and those that stay with God are angels
[1:15:57] Hallelujah is that right he brought that
[1:16:00] same division down into Earth now look
[1:16:03] at this look look look look look and
[1:16:05] then when when when when when when Satan
[1:16:07] or Lucifer who being a murderer inspired
[1:16:10] the serpent and and guess what the the
[1:16:12] seed of the serpent comes and he's a
[1:16:14] murderer and what did he do divided the
[1:16:17] family
[1:16:18] so it was so bad because he wouldn't
[1:16:20] repent God drove him out of the Garden
[1:16:23] of Eden and from from ever since then
[1:16:26] you've had two kinds of people
[1:16:29] a people of God
[1:16:31] and the people of the devil
[1:16:33] and what happens they mix all up mix all
[1:16:36] up and then the flood y'all know how
[1:16:38] that works and then at the end of the
[1:16:40] day
[1:16:41] God knows them that are his
[1:16:46] no matter how mixed up it is with us
[1:16:49] God knows the bloodline
[1:16:53] amen and after the encountered God's
[1:16:57] mercy and goodness will do what follow
[1:16:59] you how many times that's been sold
[1:17:02] in your darkest night in your darkest
[1:17:06] hour your darkest moment when you think
[1:17:08] it can't get any worse then all of a
[1:17:11] sudden the sun shines
[1:17:13] it happens
[1:17:15] because goodness and mercy shall what
[1:17:17] follow them follow you why the seed of
[1:17:21] God you don't understand how blessed you
[1:17:24] are
[1:17:25] but God is in he's he's he says listen
[1:17:28] content for the word faith that was once
[1:17:32] delivered unto the Saints and that Faith
[1:17:34] was Unity
[1:17:36] it was they loved each other
[1:17:39] look what God did when when ananias and
[1:17:42] Sapphire tried to bring Separation by
[1:17:44] their actions
[1:17:46] she's a little living levels the whole
[1:17:48] lump if he had only let that go others
[1:17:50] would have done the same but God made an
[1:17:52] example and destroyed them right there
[1:17:56] that day is coming again
[1:17:58] because God's bringing Unity to the
[1:18:00] Church of God and when I say that I mean
[1:18:02] universal I don't mean in just a little
[1:18:04] Fellowship I mean God is bringing Unity
[1:18:06] there's a working that God is doing in
[1:18:08] the hearts of men and all they want to
[1:18:10] do is love and forgive love and forgive
[1:18:13] and restore
[1:18:15] that's it
[1:18:18] you know we're not caring about who you
[1:18:20] are where you came from all that kind of
[1:18:22] crazy stuff I don't need to know your
[1:18:24] mom or your dad or neither your grandpa
[1:18:27] you don't know what I'm saying I don't
[1:18:29] need to know none of that
[1:18:31] the truth of the matter is we're Sons
[1:18:33] and Daughters of God you have heard the
[1:18:36] call of this end time message and God
[1:18:39] has brought you out of a system we can
[1:18:42] allow this to become another system
[1:18:43] we've got to fight we've got to move we
[1:18:46] gotta tear down every Philistine there
[1:18:49] is
[1:18:50] It's gotta be
[1:18:53] guess what you're gonna look like the
[1:18:54] radical
[1:18:55] you're going to look like the oddball
[1:18:58] because you on fire for God let
[1:19:00] everybody else be lukewarm if they want
[1:19:02] to be Hallelujah but those of us who can
[1:19:05] discern the time and the season
[1:19:08] hallelujah we're praying God set my soul
[1:19:11] of fire
[1:19:13] Hallelujah
[1:19:14] glory to God
[1:19:16] you love the Lord
[1:19:19] oh my God
[1:19:22] I'm gonna read this Matthew 10 24 you
[1:19:24] don't have to turn there he said think
[1:19:26] not that I've come to send peace on
[1:19:28] Earth I came not to send peace but a
[1:19:30] sword for I am come to set us man at
[1:19:34] variance against his father now when God
[1:19:36] dropped that King sword into the
[1:19:38] prophet's hand and that king showed us
[1:19:40] now in the bride's hand what do you
[1:19:41] think he says oh this is a beautiful
[1:19:43] sword no God gave that sword to fight
[1:19:48] it is a great division oh my God it's
[1:19:51] not to bring peace everybody so oh I
[1:19:53] want to tell a message I want to tell
[1:19:55] him I want to witness to him and praise
[1:19:56] God but let me tell you something if
[1:19:59] that individual those individuals if
[1:20:01] they're ordained of God you bring peace
[1:20:03] but if they're not again of God you
[1:20:06] bring War
[1:20:08] but we can't be afraid

[1:22:07] what be they of his own household
[1:22:13] that's where your battle is coming from
[1:22:15] it's not from the street or you know you
[1:22:17] might get some battles off of a job but
[1:22:20] your main battles
[1:22:21] it's going to come from the church
[1:22:24] that's where it's at
[1:22:26] and God put all us together
[1:22:29] to make us what bring each other to
[1:22:32] perfection
[1:22:34] right
[1:22:37] was it iron sharp in his arm that's what
[1:22:40] it is
[1:22:42] don't get up oh my sister listen you
[1:22:45] don't look at your sister did not read
[1:22:47] the scripture we do not wrestle against
[1:22:49] flesh and blood it ain't your sister it
[1:22:52] ain't your brother it's the spirit that
[1:22:54] operating on them listen the Lord
[1:22:57] understood it When They Crucified him he
[1:22:59] said father forgive them for they know
[1:23:02] not what they do now that's love
[1:23:07] when you make excuses
[1:23:09] and understand it's a spirit that's
[1:23:11] talking and not the person himself
[1:23:14] and he said and he listen
[1:23:17] and he that loveth father a mother more
[1:23:21] than me
[1:23:22] is not worthy of me
[1:23:24] and he that love is son or daughter more
[1:23:28] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:23:32] taketh not his cross and follow after me
[1:23:36] is not worthy of me if the battle is
[1:23:39] coming the battle is coming if the
[1:23:42] battle is with your wife or your husband
[1:23:43] your son and your daughter amen it's the
[1:23:47] battle
[1:23:48] but at the end of the day
[1:23:50] whoever you were battling with must see
[1:23:54] you standing on the word
[1:24:02] you keep that nonsin up what
[1:24:07] you go what
[1:24:10] God always come first
[1:24:15] God always come first
[1:24:20] and it's just a matter of Truth
[1:24:23] and the Bible said the truth shall make
[1:24:26] you free
[1:24:29] he that receiveth you receiveth me
[1:24:33] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[1:24:35] that sent me he that receiveth the
[1:24:38] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[1:24:40] receive what a prophet's reward
[1:24:44] um he said I don't believe in the
[1:24:46] prophets no more
[1:24:48] but you don't believe the full word
[1:24:50] because God said there will be some
[1:24:53] and what people don't understand is that
[1:24:55] in this last day God sent us a prophet
[1:24:58] why because of the mess we're living in
[1:25:01] everybody's right now everybody's not
[1:25:03] right God is right and God interprets
[1:25:06] his own word
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:12] and when God sent the prophet the
[1:25:13] majority of the people don't receive him
[1:25:15] that's the truth even when Jesus came
[1:25:17] the prophet of all prophets right the
[1:25:20] world turned his back on him crucified
[1:25:22] him even the church hated him why he
[1:25:26] used the Living Word show me one thing
[1:25:28] he did wrong show me one thing he did
[1:25:30] Evil Jesus Christ
[1:25:34] right
[1:25:36] they said that when they were crucifying
[1:25:37] Jesus Mary ran up to the you know I
[1:25:40] think this is Josephus account Mary ran
[1:25:42] up and says what did he do what did he
[1:25:44] do he was good they slapped in her face
[1:25:49] see
[1:25:54] people don't want to hear truth
[1:25:56] they say they do when truth comes is a
[1:25:58] different story
[1:26:00] he that receiveth you receiveth me he
[1:26:02] that receiveth me receiving him that
[1:26:04] sent me he the receiver the prophet in
[1:26:06] the name of the Prophet shall receive a
[1:26:07] prophet's reward he that receiveth the
[1:26:10] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:26:11] man shall receive a righteous man reward
[1:26:14] and whosoever shall give to drink unto
[1:26:17] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[1:26:20] water only in the name of it of of a
[1:26:25] disciple verily I say unto you he shall
[1:26:28] in no wise lose his real war
[1:26:31] we forget about that
[1:26:34] but my point is this and I'm coming to a
[1:26:36] close
[1:26:37] in this session
[1:26:40] may God help us all
[1:26:43] because our most of our marriages are I
[1:26:46] won't say marriages I want to say
[1:26:47] families
[1:26:49] a fact is fragmented
[1:26:52] and it's going to take God
[1:26:54] to bring it all together
[1:26:55] don't even think you can do it
[1:26:58] it takes down on my knees
[1:27:01] just like that woman when she was being
[1:27:03] mistreated about her husband she went
[1:27:05] down on her knees you know what I'm
[1:27:07] saying that's the only thing but you
[1:27:09] gotta understand Focus
[1:27:13] bring a Unity to my family
[1:27:16] bring a Unity between my wife and me you
[1:27:19] understand me bring a Unity Lord so that
[1:27:22] we can be an example in the church a
[1:27:25] little 11 levels to hold up you know
[1:27:27] when you see a family together it is the
[1:27:29] one of the most beautiful things you've
[1:27:31] ever seen
[1:27:32] and I'll be honest with you in my life
[1:27:34] I've only seen a few families throughout
[1:27:36] the Pentecostal church and some in the
[1:27:38] message that was so United you could
[1:27:41] tell it they weren't faking it was real
[1:27:43] love and respect for one another how
[1:27:45] many of y'all remember how we used to
[1:27:46] have respect for one another
[1:27:49] but in America and I guess in all over
[1:27:51] the world are these cartoons have showed
[1:27:54] these children how to be disrespectful
[1:27:55] not only to their mothers to their
[1:27:58] fathers to their their that's the
[1:28:00] scripture
[1:28:02] right wives been disrespectful to their
[1:28:05] husbands husbands disrespectful to them
[1:28:08] y'all understand me how do they see this
[1:28:10] television
[1:28:12] right and all of that stuff has been
[1:28:15] slowly moving in a dark way to do what
[1:28:18] divide the family
[1:28:21] and it's done just that
[1:28:23] because we know and listen it stayed
[1:28:26] outside of the church for a long time
[1:28:28] until we welcomed it in
[1:28:31] right we allowed it to come in and when
[1:28:35] it came in guess what our children
[1:28:37] became delinquent
[1:28:39] you know what brother Brandon said
[1:28:42] he said you ought to spank the parents
[1:28:48] I thought I I forgot I forgot to paste
[1:28:52] it but he said you ought to spank the
[1:28:54] parents because they're the ones who
[1:28:55] delinquent
[1:28:57] foreign
[1:28:59] may God help us
[1:29:01] I've been crying out that the teachers
[1:29:03] they
[1:29:04] for Sunday school teachers you got to
[1:29:06] teach them if you don't Lord may God
[1:29:09] help us and that's one thing I love
[1:29:11] about my wife she's she's constantly
[1:29:13] trying to give Judah that word you know
[1:29:15] and I appreciate that
[1:29:16] she's more she's faithful to it the more
[1:29:19] faithful that I am
[1:29:20] you know but you gotta teach these
[1:29:23] children how to love God and know that
[1:29:26] God is not a tyrant
[1:29:29] he's a god of love and God if you trust
[1:29:32] God he'll he'll he'll he'll manifest
[1:29:35] himself to you doesn't make any
[1:29:37] difference how old you are
[1:29:39] you can be young
[1:29:41] I can remember praying before the Lord
[1:29:43] didn't even know him but I knew the god
[1:29:45] of my mom you know what I'm saying I've
[1:29:48] seen God work in her life and I would
[1:29:50] pray things and I knew he would do it
[1:29:52] and he would do it
[1:29:56] let me tell you something you cannot
[1:29:58] pray for a better family and God won't
[1:30:01] listen don't listen this is oh his whole
[1:30:06] thing about Redemption is to bring his
[1:30:09] family back together
[1:30:10] in such a love that they would have such
[1:30:13] a respect for one another amen that they
[1:30:15] wouldn't let one crack come between them
[1:30:19] and that's what has got to start we got
[1:30:21] to start here with that I don't care if
[1:30:24] your family is unsaved you still gotta
[1:30:27] love them
[1:30:28] and if you've done wrong make it right
[1:30:31] they need to see Jesus in you
[1:30:34] right
[1:30:35] and people of God we wouldn't have never
[1:30:37] known I'm trying to say this enclosure
[1:30:39] let me close
[1:30:40] there's a lot of things I could have
[1:30:41] said this tonight but let me say it like
[1:30:44] this
[1:30:45] if the world is falling apart because of
[1:30:48] the vision
[1:30:51] what are we supposed to be doing
[1:30:54] because the Bible tells us even the
[1:30:56] prophet of God comes along and says this
[1:30:58] is United times and signs
[1:31:01] this is the invisible Union of the bride
[1:31:04] with her husband
[1:31:06] and our Union comes by way of trust and
[1:31:10] believe in one another
[1:31:12] and when we can trust and believe one
[1:31:14] another that means we don't have to
[1:31:15] worry about you gossiping we don't have
[1:31:17] to worry about you backbiting we don't
[1:31:19] have to you understand me and we
[1:31:20] understand that if you misunderstand me
[1:31:22] you're going to be a man or woman enough
[1:31:24] to try to get it under understanding of
[1:31:27] what's being said you know what I mean
[1:31:28] you're not going to let the devil play
[1:31:31] in your mind because that's where
[1:31:34] division comes
[1:31:37] I'm guilty
[1:31:39] and I'm sure all of us have been guilty
[1:31:41] one point or another
[1:31:43] but you know we need to repent and ask
[1:31:45] God to say Lord help us be better
[1:31:48] Christians
[1:31:49] this is my family
[1:31:51] I'm part of your family where you like
[1:31:53] it or not
[1:31:54] vice versa and we need to treat each
[1:31:56] other that way love one another
[1:31:59] that's what Jesus said love each other
[1:32:02] even as I have loved you
[1:32:05] people of God I know it just it may be a
[1:32:07] simple message but I tell you the truth
[1:32:09] this is a foundational message
[1:32:11] if we could work on this
[1:32:15] you'll be surprised on how to change
[1:32:17] things
[1:32:18] that's been the issue here and
[1:32:20] everywhere else Everybody Somebody think
[1:32:23] they're better than somebody else and
[1:32:25] because they don't come from this when
[1:32:26] they come from that and you know I'm
[1:32:28] thinking where do I fit in
[1:32:31] you understand what I'm saying my point
[1:32:33] is listen there's only one blood
[1:32:38] hello that's what the Bible says we all
[1:32:40] came from one blood
[1:32:43] that means our origin is from the same
[1:32:46] place
[1:32:49] and there's only one blood that was shed
[1:32:51] for you and that's the blood of Jesus
[1:32:53] Christ
[1:32:54] right
[1:32:56] no man can save you
[1:32:59] you can't even save yourself
[1:33:02] it's all about the grace of God
[1:33:04] trusting that God will deal with your
[1:33:06] heart
[1:33:08] and you know it's amazing how we all go
[1:33:10] through something
[1:33:13] I I I I hope my sister
[1:33:17] I I really hurt for our sister Joanne
[1:33:20] it's something personal that I can't say
[1:33:22] over the pulpit but I hurt and you know
[1:33:24] I I could feel the pain
[1:33:27] but I want to if she's looking at this I
[1:33:29] want to tell her you don't you you know
[1:33:31] just try your best to straighten up and
[1:33:33] trust God
[1:33:34] this might look like the worst
[1:33:37] but God got something better
[1:33:40] you know no man is in control of this
[1:33:42] God is in control
[1:33:44] and you know I've seen my own children
[1:33:46] you know put me in a position I mean I'm
[1:33:49] thinking oh my
[1:33:51] but you know what I trust God
[1:33:55] and I always go back to the fact that
[1:33:58] God saved job's children
[1:34:02] they got killed while they were partying
[1:34:06] right and God gave job his children God
[1:34:11] can give me mine
[1:34:13] that's the way I look at it I trust him
[1:34:16] let's stand
[1:34:17] I hope this has been a blessing to you
[1:34:21] and those of us who are fathers and you
[1:34:23] know we know we got one mama in here
[1:34:28] we got to work hard
[1:34:30] we got to get our family back we got to
[1:34:32] get our children back try to sow the
[1:34:34] word you know try to sow the word as
[1:34:37] much as you possibly can you know uh but
[1:34:40] most of all pray
[1:34:43] you gotta pray
[1:34:44] God that God will work quick and fast
[1:34:47] through prayer he can do things you
[1:34:49] can't do
[1:34:50] is that right so let's just pray that
[1:34:53] God let's pray before we met dismiss
[1:34:55] let's pray that God will unite the
[1:34:57] families in this church
[1:34:59] and that they would resolve all their
[1:35:01] differences
[1:35:03] husband and wives children you know how
[1:35:06] disobedient children are now they
[1:35:08] talking sassy their mom and their daddy
[1:35:10] oh my God it wasn't like that in my day
[1:35:17] and now even the politics is again it's
[1:35:20] for them
[1:35:21] no they can talk to you and you can't
[1:35:23] touch them oh you don't live in my house
[1:35:25] then
[1:35:26] because God say spare the rod just
[1:35:28] bought a child I believe that I don't
[1:35:31] believe you need to abuse them but I
[1:35:33] need you need to spank them enough that
[1:35:34] they know that the devil just pulls a
[1:35:36] trick on them
[1:35:37] right
[1:35:38] I just believe that if you don't teach
[1:35:40] them there is a devil they'll never know
[1:35:42] it's one
[1:35:43] psychology and all that stuff saying
[1:35:45] that's you no no no there's two
[1:35:47] Inspirations one is of God and one is of
[1:35:49] the devil
[1:35:50] right
[1:35:51] that's the way it works let us pray
[1:35:55] our gracious father God we come before
[1:35:57] you
[1:35:58] we thank you for your grace and your
[1:36:01] mercy
[1:36:02] we thank you for being so good to us
[1:36:05] Lord I wish I could just preach it the
[1:36:07] way I feel it and the way I see it
[1:36:10] oh God have mercy upon us Lord I I was
[1:36:13] thinking about the power of the family
[1:36:15] and and Lord how how how how great that
[1:36:19] is

[1:36:23] own that's on record uh and it was
[1:36:25] nicodin uh
[1:36:27] that was in the scripture Lord and how
