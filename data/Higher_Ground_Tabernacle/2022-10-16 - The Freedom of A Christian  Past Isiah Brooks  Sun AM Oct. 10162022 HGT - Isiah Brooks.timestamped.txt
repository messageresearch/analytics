[35:23] um
[35:25] well just the other day we met the
[35:28] pastor there
[35:31] he is from Liberia
[35:35] and uh
[35:37] he was interested in getting together
[35:42] their services start at 11 something
[35:46] and I told him actually I thought the
[35:48] brother in the back was him
[35:50] but they look a little like a light but
[35:53] nevertheless I thought it was amazing
[35:58] because there is a house next to ours
[36:04] that specialize in helping uh
[36:08] mental challenge children yes
[36:15] and my wife is always communicating
[36:21] and it was through her that I came to
[36:24] know him
[36:27] but we had a great fellowship
[36:30] and who knows where God will take us
[36:33] with this
[36:35] amen you love the Lord
[36:38] secondly we're going to have two
[36:40] services on Sunday
[36:44] this coming Sunday
[36:46] and then starting at three o'clock we'll
[36:48] start at 3 30.
[36:52] that's the evening service
[36:54] the morning service is a regular time
[36:59] we have communion during that service
[37:02] for those who want to take communion
[37:05] we'll have our brother Andy Schuler
[37:10] from
[37:12] Arizona
[37:14] Tucson Arizona
[37:16] he is the assistant to our brother
[37:23] we've had him here before
[37:26] it's been a while
[37:28] but he was a blessing to us then
[37:31] I know he'll be a blessing to us again
[37:36] so he'll be speaking here Sunday morning
[37:40] and because it's been a long time since
[37:42] I've been down to Iowa City here comes
[37:45] I'll be in Iowa City on Sunday morning
[37:49] he'll preached Sunday morning here
[37:52] and Sunday evening as well

[38:11] [Music]
[38:19] my sister was the only sister left
[38:22] myself
[38:25] our family have a tendency of dying at a
[38:30] young age
[38:32] and out of the 16 children my mother had
[38:36] had the truly says
[38:39] there's only three of us left
[38:43] I contribute my years to God's grace
[38:49] and I appreciate his uh giving me the
[38:52] years that I have for example I would
[38:55] have had with him by God's grace
[38:58] my sister had just turned 70 years old
[39:01] my son
[39:04] it has been a real trying time for me uh
[39:10] because I don't know
[39:13] I've never seen her live a Christian
[39:16] life
[39:18] but before she died
[39:21] she did tell me that she made things
[39:23] right with God and my video
[39:26] so I hold faster that is
[39:30] that God will
[39:32] have been gracious to her to join the
[39:36] um amen
[39:40] amen amen
[39:42] and we have our brother Simon's mom

[40:09] into the word of God
[40:13] maybe you've never
[40:16] walked a day in sin
[40:21] and
[40:23] you've never had
[40:25] to lift
[40:27] your life
[40:29] so black
[40:30] that light couldn't enter in
[40:34] maybe he never
[40:37] came at night
[40:39] to dry your eyes so swollen by the tears
[40:47] because of pain and sorrows
[40:52] no hope of tomorrow
[40:57] down through the years
[41:01] but he did it for me
[41:06] Jesus did it for me
[41:09] [Music]
[41:11] I can't help but praise him when I think
[41:17] of what I
[41:21] used to be
[41:26] [Music]
[41:28] by his grace
[41:31] I've been washed in his blood
[41:36] he took my shame
[41:39] upon his back
[41:42] oh the Crimson Flood
[41:46] now every time I hear the word oh
[41:52] something in my heart is dirt and I can
[41:57] feel God's Praises running in my soul
[42:06] maybe you never felt lost and alone
[42:14] and you've never felt a burning hell
[42:19] could someday be your home
[42:24] maybe you never
[42:27] needed
[42:29] someone to set you free
[42:33] but I know someone who needed him and
[42:39] that someone is
[42:41] me
[42:43] he did it for me
[42:47] Jesus did it for me
[42:50] foreign
[42:54] [Music]
[43:08] [Music]
[43:15] [Music]
[43:25] not every time I hear the word
[43:30] something in my Harvesters and I can
[43:34] feel God's Praises rumbling in my soul
[43:41] he did it for me
[43:44] Jesus did it for me
[43:48] [Music]
[43:51] I can't help but praise him when I think
[43:56] of what I
[43:59] used to be foreign
[44:03] [Music]
[44:23] [Music]
[44:34] [Music]
[44:41] Jesus did it for me
[44:44] [Music]
[44:47] I can't help but
[44:50] Praises when I think of what I
[44:55] used to be
[44:59] oh I've been redeemed by his grace
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] think in my heart is dirt as I can feel
[45:18] God Praises running in my soul
[45:23] my soul
[45:25] my soul my soul
[45:29] I can feel God's Praises rumbling in my
[45:34] soul
[45:38] not every time I hear the word
[45:43] something in my heart is dirt I can feel
[45:48] God's Praises rumbling in
[45:52] my soul
[45:54] [Music]
[46:03] Hallelujah
[46:07] when I think about the goodness of Jesus
[46:11] and all that he's done for me
[46:16] my soul Cries Out Hallelujah
[46:19] and I thank God for saving me
[46:22] as we stand let us stand
[46:29] we are
[46:32] you know I I don't know about you all
[46:36] and
[46:37] the battles that you go through
[46:42] but if you're not fighting
[46:46] something's wrong yeah
[46:51] if you're not going through trials
[46:56] then Satan has you yeah
[47:01] this is not a time of picnicking
[47:06] but we are under uh the time of War
[47:13] even if we look in at our our
[47:16] political Realms
[47:19] you you have the conservatives against
[47:23] the Liberals
[47:26] but the Bride of Jesus Christ is needle
[47:29] neither
[47:32] because she's in the middle of the road
[47:36] but it shows us
[47:39] what's happening among the people
[47:42] the church World
[47:44] he's going to either be conservative
[47:48] in other words legalistic
[47:52] or you're going to be a liberal
[47:55] meaning that you just believe in grace
[48:00] and grace is going to let you do
[48:03] whatever you want to do yeah
[48:06] but the Bible tells us
[48:08] shall we continue in sin
[48:11] that Grace may evound
[48:14] God forbid
[48:19] as we stand
[48:22] I trust we're in the middle of the world
[48:26] being in the middle of the road
[48:29] means that you can love someone
[48:31] different from you
[48:34] and when they're right they're right
[48:38] and when they're wrong they're wrong
[48:41] but you could even you can still love
[48:43] them
[48:48] let's go to Saint John 3 16.
[48:51] he says
[48:56] and from there we'll read Ephesians
[49:00] 2 4 through 10. this
[49:06] we know the scripture
[49:08] and and more than likely we should be
[49:11] able to
[49:12] quote it by heart
[49:18] but this is a powerful scripture let me
[49:20] see you in the cultural and I trust that
[49:23] somehow God will
[49:25] Enlighten it to us this morning
[49:31] for God so loved the world
[49:35] that he gave his only begotten son
[49:39] that whosoever believeth in him should
[49:42] not perish
[49:43] but have everlasting life is
[49:55] amen amen Ephesians 2 episode
[50:08] starting at the fourth verse
[50:18] but God
[50:20] who is rich in Mercy
[50:23] for this great love wherewith he loved
[50:25] us
[50:27] um
[50:30] even when we were dead in sins
[50:33] have quickened us together with Christ
[50:36] by Grace ye are saved Hallelujah
[50:44] and have raised us up together
[50:47] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[50:50] places in Christ Jesus Christ
[50:57] that in the age to come he might show
[51:00] the exceeding Riches of his grace in his
[51:04] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[51:13] Christ for by grace are you saved
[51:17] through faith
[51:19] and that not of yourself
[51:21] it is the gift of God
[51:26] foreign
[51:31] for by grace are you saved through faith
[51:35] and that not of yourself
[51:37] it is the gift of God because
[51:45] not of works that's any man should boast
[51:49] said
[51:52] for we are his workmanship
[51:55] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[51:59] which God hath before ordained that we
[52:04] should walk in them
[52:18] let us pray you know Heavenly Father
[52:22] once again we come before your throne
[52:25] thanking you for your grace
[52:28] thank you for God
[52:30] who lives in US
[52:33] [Music]
[52:34] protects us
[52:37] who leads us in a country
[52:40] who speaks to us
[52:43] who listens to us
[52:46] I thank you Father for being a prayer
[52:50] answering God
[52:53] we pray this morning that you would
[52:57] bless the service in a special way
[52:59] give us Grace to move out of your ways
[53:03] from all our unrighteousness
[53:06] in the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:10] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[53:14] amen amen you may be seated views that's
[53:17] all
[53:22] I have been so encouraged
[53:26] by the word and
[53:29] since my uh sister passed
[53:36] and you know the thing that really uh
[53:39] excites me is
[53:41] [Music]
[53:42] because I know we're not far from
[53:46] translations
[53:51] the word of God has declared to us
[53:55] that the seventh seal is open it is
[53:59] but it's open to a particular people
[54:04] we know
[54:06] when brother Brandon was here
[54:09] we understood his mission
[54:13] and his mission was to reveal the son of
[54:17] man
[54:19] it was also to call out a bride
[54:24] out of denominations
[54:27] into the headship of Christ
[54:32] she becomes him
[54:34] he becomes her
[54:36] his righteousness
[54:39] robes her in his grace
[54:43] as the prophet of God
[54:46] no Creed but Christ
[54:49] no law but love
[54:53] and if we understand
[54:55] the preview of the Bride
[54:58] she was wasn't staying as she marched
[55:02] before the Lord
[55:05] and she walked according to the word
[55:08] she wasn't staying on a level plane
[55:12] but she was stepping upwards
[55:16] and that's how it is this message
[55:20] causes us to step upwards not backwards
[55:25] not to stay on the same plane but we're
[55:29] moving higher and higher and higher
[55:33] as I said on Wednesday
[55:36] this church is called The Higher Grounds
[55:43] if we don't move forward
[55:47] if we don't continue to move higher
[55:51] than the name we call our church
[55:55] will become a Blasphemous name
[55:59] Hallelujah that is what happens this is
[56:02] when Christian calls themselves
[56:05] Christians
[56:06] and are not Christians then you walk as
[56:11] a blasphemer
[56:13] um Hallelujah her footsteps the bride
[56:19] footsteps were ordered by the Lord
[56:23] ordered by the revealed word
[56:26] hallelujah and this revelation
[56:29] of who he is and what did it mean and
[56:33] and what he means to her because
[56:37] brings peace
[56:39] brings Joy it brings overcoming power
[56:44] yeah
[56:46] when we look in the scripture
[56:49] we see that God so loved the world
[56:53] so we move out of laodice
[56:57] Hallelujah brotherly kindness
[57:00] and all of the things that comes with
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:25] [Music]
[57:40] but until you move into Divine love
[57:44] Hallelujah
[57:46] Rapture don't live more
[57:48] the Rapture we'll only take those
[57:52] who have accomplished
[57:55] let me say it like this this one towards
[57:57] you the Rapture will only take those who
[58:02] have accomplished the gold for their age
[58:08] and that goal is it objective is divine
[58:12] love see hello somebody
[58:15] so you see
[58:17] why you have been chosen
[58:21] in the most wicked age ever
[58:26] you're living in the age
[58:29] where the house is divided
[58:32] like I said if we want a Revival in this
[58:36] church
[58:38] before we can fix the church
[58:41] we must fix the family
[58:44] hello amen before we can fix the church
[58:50] each family must be fixed is that the
[58:55] Bible
[58:56] where you get that from
[58:59] even in the Exodus
[59:02] when Moses were getting ready
[59:05] to deliver the children out of Egypt
[59:10] every family
[59:13] had to come together
[59:16] each family had to come together and
[59:21] each family had to have the blood on the
[59:25] doorpost and the little you see the
[59:28] family has to be fixed
[59:33] it brings the church into one Union
[59:36] hallelujah amen come on somebody we're
[59:40] not a union by way of law
[59:45] hallelujah we're not a union by way of
[59:48] creed
[59:50] this church because we all come here
[59:55] does not bring us into Oneness
[59:58] Hallelujah only the wit the only way you
[1:00:03] and I can come into Oneness
[1:00:08] with the Holy Ghost the Bible says so by
[1:00:12] one Spirit are you baptized into one
[1:00:15] body
[1:00:16] Hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:20] comes to understand
[1:00:22] he doesn't just need the Holy Ghost but
[1:00:25] she needs a mature she needs to lay in
[1:00:29] the presence of the sun
[1:00:31] Hallelujah but we also understand
[1:00:34] that though we go through our trials
[1:00:40] God is still rich in Mercy
[1:00:43] Hallelujah it is God who began to walk
[1:00:48] in you it is God who's going to finish
[1:00:50] it Hallelujah
[1:00:53] I'm counting on it
[1:00:55] Hallelujah is that all right see
[1:01:00] it was God's grace
[1:01:02] that was given to Noah
[1:01:05] in the time of the antiluvian day
[1:01:09] it was God's grace it wasn't nothing
[1:01:12] Noah did it
[1:01:17] Hallelujah see it's nothing you can do
[1:01:20] to marry God's grace his grace is
[1:01:24] unnarrative
[1:01:25] hallelujah but is his knowledge of who
[1:01:29] you are come on somebody it's God's
[1:01:33] knowledge of who you are is that right
[1:01:36] the Bible says that the Lord knows them
[1:01:40] that are his because
[1:01:46] it was God who gave Noah instructions
[1:01:51] on how to build the ark
[1:01:54] Hallelujah see Noah didn't have his own
[1:01:57] blueprints it was God who gave nor that
[1:02:00] blueprints
[1:02:03] because I mean let me tell you this
[1:02:06] listen when
[1:02:08] frios come
[1:02:10] if you don't know who you are
[1:02:14] Satan as as as Jesus told Peter
[1:02:19] desire to sift you as wheat
[1:02:25] and that's the problem
[1:02:28] let me say it like this y'all sitting
[1:02:31] down there acting like I'm a lettering
[1:02:34] to you
[1:02:36] let me say something
[1:02:39] your ordinances
[1:02:41] your
[1:02:43] rules your regulations means nothing
[1:02:50] to God
[1:02:52] and most of us
[1:02:54] judge one another
[1:02:56] because of our laws our rules and our
[1:03:00] regulations
[1:03:02] hello
[1:03:04] that's what brings undenominationalism
[1:03:09] hello right now meant to know in this
[1:03:14] assembly
[1:03:16] we have some here some here it's
[1:03:19] something
[1:03:20] you know what's dividing you
[1:03:23] your self-righteousness
[1:03:27] because you think
[1:03:30] you can fast and somebody else can
[1:03:34] I'm just using it for an example you
[1:03:38] think you're more holy
[1:03:41] your Holiness don't doesn't even come by
[1:03:45] your words
[1:03:48] Hallelujah
[1:03:50] is that right you must understand
[1:03:53] he became our sins that we might become
[1:03:58] his righteousness it is God who will not
[1:04:02] impute Sins
[1:04:04] Not that you don't sin it is God who
[1:04:07] will not charge you
[1:04:09] because he justified
[1:04:14] Hallelujah
[1:04:16] see if we could really see that it's
[1:04:18] important we're coming here jumping
[1:04:20] almost
[1:04:21] Hallelujah because we realize that he
[1:04:25] whom the son is set free is free indeed
[1:04:28] hallelujah amen
[1:04:33] just escaping this age
[1:04:37] has the ability to escape this age
[1:04:44] you know the battles you go through
[1:04:49] you know how often you fall
[1:04:52] every day
[1:04:54] you know the thoughts that goes through
[1:04:57] your mind
[1:04:57] every day Hallelujah
[1:05:01] that's why I said when I think of the
[1:05:04] goodness of Jesus
[1:05:08] my soul Cries Out Hallelujah
[1:05:11] I thank God for saving me
[1:05:15] hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:33] somebody who can give us righteousness
[1:05:36] somebody who can not impute our sins
[1:05:41] we didn't know that
[1:05:43] Hallelujah but at the revealing of the
[1:05:46] word
[1:05:49] he told us that we've been Justified
[1:05:54] Hallelujah as though we've never sinned
[1:05:57] in the first place
[1:05:59] I don't know about you but that brings
[1:06:02] your joy when I realized today no matter
[1:06:06] what I go through there's no
[1:06:09] condemnation
[1:06:14] of God
[1:06:16] hallelujah what you saying brother bro
[1:06:19] I'm saying this morning
[1:06:21] there's a freedom in this message
[1:06:25] it's by your own mind it's by your own
[1:06:29] way of thinking it's by your own way of
[1:06:33] Hallelujah because God has set you free
[1:06:40] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] that's the problem
[1:06:45] this message become a war ground
[1:06:48] a ground for war so massage
[1:06:55] it's it's a it's not supposed to be that
[1:06:58] this church versus that church
[1:07:03] where is the Brotherly Love where's the
[1:07:07] brotherly kindness Hallelujah you see I
[1:07:10] can't fellowship with you
[1:07:11] Hallelujah cause you have communion in
[1:07:14] the morning
[1:07:17] and I have communion in the evening
[1:07:19] Hallelujah and brother Brandon said
[1:07:22] communion should be done in the evening
[1:07:24] and at the same token brother Brandon
[1:07:28] had communion
[1:07:31] in the coming of the new year
[1:07:33] you understand me
[1:07:35] early in the morning
[1:07:38] Hallelujah not late in the evening you
[1:07:42] see no laws
[1:07:47] y'all understand me and when you do
[1:07:50] those kind of things you separate
[1:07:53] yourself and place yourself in bondage
[1:08:00] you know
[1:08:02] we don't quoted this message so much
[1:08:05] we worked in the Catholic creeds
[1:08:12] and most people that quoted it don't
[1:08:15] even understand it
[1:08:18] see how sad y'all look is
[1:08:24] I know what I'm talking about you see
[1:08:26] because if you don't come to a place
[1:08:29] let me ask you a question
[1:08:31] if you judge continue to judge
[1:08:36] others by your righteousness
[1:08:40] Hallelujah you see what I'm saying so he
[1:08:43] said that's what we do but you know what
[1:08:46] we do when we fail
[1:08:59] Jesus said
[1:09:01] how many of y'all know it's wrong
[1:09:02] Camille adultery
[1:09:06] now to raise your hand
[1:09:08] s
[1:09:11] it's wrong
[1:09:13] but Jesus put it on the plane
[1:09:17] some of y'all ain't never done it
[1:09:19] physically
[1:09:21] but he said if you think within your
[1:09:23] heart
[1:09:25] you've done it already hello
[1:09:29] so he puts everybody on a plane
[1:09:32] the same place
[1:09:35] you need help
[1:09:37] I need help
[1:09:39] need everybody need help you hear what
[1:09:42] I'm saying companies but because you've
[1:09:44] never done it doesn't mean you never
[1:09:47] thought it this is
[1:09:49] hallelujah and in the eyes of the Lord
[1:09:52] you just as guilty but I know somebody
[1:09:56] who can take away the guilty stain
[1:10:01] it is the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:04] Hallelujah this is what this message has
[1:10:07] done for us
[1:10:09] it has allowed us to free ourselves
[1:10:13] foreign
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:50] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:10:53] brother Brandon we had it once a month
[1:10:56] at least that's what we know hey almost
[1:10:59] excuse me but my point is we don't even
[1:11:01] have it once a month
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:04] Hallelujah so are you going to condemn
[1:11:08] yourselves
[1:11:09] because you don't have it once a month
[1:11:13] that's nonsense nonsense
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:20] but people will leave the church
[1:11:22] y'all don't have communion enough you
[1:11:25] know what I ain't worrying about y'all
[1:11:26] leaving cause y'all don't show up
[1:11:30] I'm gonna tell it just like y'all know
[1:11:33] I'm gonna tell it yeah
[1:11:37] maybe one or some time
[1:11:39] where are the Christians
[1:11:43] because a person who's afraid of
[1:11:45] communion
[1:11:47] you're not a Christian
[1:11:49] you're pretending to be one day
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:54] um
[1:11:57] I don't know something pulled me way off
[1:11:59] the word way off of where I should come
[1:12:01] up
[1:12:02] we are in a place
[1:12:04] that we've seen the Pentecostal moves
[1:12:08] right we've seen the anointing on us
[1:12:12] we've seen an awning with us
[1:12:15] we've seen the anointing speaking in
[1:12:18] tongues
[1:12:21] but we're beyond that
[1:12:23] y'all hear what I'm saying let me say
[1:12:26] Let me let me say it like this do you
[1:12:28] know there are still people in this
[1:12:31] message
[1:12:32] who believe that the seals have not yet
[1:12:35] been okay
[1:12:39] now where did that put them
[1:12:42] you understand me they still believe
[1:12:45] they read the same books
[1:12:47] they listen to the same tapes but
[1:12:50] they've separated themselves because one
[1:12:53] believed the seals are open and the
[1:12:56] other one
[1:12:59] you see the trick of the devil is
[1:13:02] the devil that got him divided
[1:13:06] who gives revelation revelation
[1:13:10] it is God who gives Revelation
[1:13:13] and when God gave Peter the revelation
[1:13:16] of who he was
[1:13:18] never said I'm separating myself from
[1:13:21] you because you don't have the true
[1:13:23] Revelations
[1:13:27] Hallelujah but I believe Peter
[1:13:30] remembered when Jesus said that the
[1:13:34] mystery is given unto you
[1:13:37] I might get it before you but I know
[1:13:41] you're going to get it oh somebody help
[1:13:44] me here see what I'm trying to do is
[1:13:47] liberate you in your thoughts
[1:13:53] right that's why God made it up an
[1:13:56] individual thing
[1:13:59] everybody think their church is going to
[1:14:01] come sweeping through the city
[1:14:05] it ain't gonna be your church
[1:14:09] oh friend of mine
[1:14:11] who is a Baptist Minister
[1:14:14] he said brother Brooks I believe that
[1:14:19] the Baptist Doctrine
[1:14:21] closest to the word
[1:14:24] than anybody else
[1:14:27] you know what I laughed
[1:14:30] I said everybody believed that
[1:14:34] every Church believes
[1:14:37] it's the closest to the words
[1:14:41] if it wasn't so they wouldn't stay where
[1:14:43] they are
[1:14:45] and in the passage we're doing the same
[1:14:47] thing
[1:14:54] Hallelujah let me tell you the closest
[1:14:57] those who got the Holy Ghost
[1:15:00] the revelation of this message is the
[1:15:05] ceiling of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:07] Hallelujah brother
[1:15:09] it he called this message his holy ghost
[1:15:13] message you sent this please
[1:15:17] and that's after the shields
[1:15:21] and remember his wife
[1:15:23] when she talked to him
[1:15:29] you know why we why what happened why
[1:15:31] I'm gone
[1:15:33] because you fail or we failed news of a
[1:15:37] monkey could join those Pentecostals we
[1:15:40] were wrong
[1:15:41] oh come on somebody
[1:15:44] the you know I I brewed a little bit of
[1:15:47] coffee in the back if you need it right
[1:15:48] there yeah
[1:15:58] God forgive me
[1:16:00] but the point is
[1:16:08] when we see ourselves
[1:16:11] dividing ourselves
[1:16:15] because of frivolous things
[1:16:18] that don't mean nothing
[1:16:20] you say oh it doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:16:23] matter
[1:16:25] remember Peter was setting among the
[1:16:28] Gentiles
[1:16:29] and then when when when when Paul came
[1:16:32] in oh the Jews came in Peter separated
[1:16:37] himself and joined himself back to the
[1:16:39] Jews
[1:16:41] Paul rebuked him
[1:16:45] for such a prejudice
[1:16:52] is
[1:16:55] in the same Holy Ghost
[1:16:57] that rebuke Peter is rebuking you today
[1:17:02] for such nonsense nonsense
[1:17:11] would that feel good too
[1:17:16] oh
[1:17:18] what's the problem problem we need more
[1:17:22] holy ghost Zombies
[1:17:25] that's what we need we need more God in
[1:17:29] this place
[1:17:33] now you know we supposed to be greater
[1:17:36] some people said higher than the
[1:17:38] Pentecostal Church
[1:17:41] if I was a visitor coming in here
[1:17:44] you see and looking at y'all don't use
[1:17:48] foreign
[1:17:49] I'm like my God my God my God
[1:18:03] like that song say give me a smile
[1:18:06] yeah no no that's all I'm saying
[1:18:10] we in a place
[1:18:12] it's my trials are so heavy um
[1:18:18] like I said my trial is so heavy
[1:18:23] how many of y'all took the cross how
[1:18:26] many of you did you carry the cross of
[1:18:29] Calvary
[1:18:30] you climbed the the mountain of Golgotha
[1:18:36] did they pierce you in your size
[1:18:39] did they smack you in your face did they
[1:18:43] spit on you what's going on
[1:18:47] compare what you're going through to
[1:18:50] what Jesus Christ went through to bring
[1:18:54] this to you see
[1:18:58] I know I'm being Elementary
[1:19:00] but this is what God gave me to give
[1:19:02] message
[1:19:05] see until you come to understand
[1:19:08] that Christ lives within you
[1:19:14] let me tell you something the song John
[1:19:16] shows the Holy Ghost fears nothing is
[1:19:26] and when you've got the Holy Ghost you
[1:19:30] don't have to fear nothing
[1:19:32] the real Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost on
[1:19:35] fear you ever seen in the scripture
[1:19:37] where God ever feared anything
[1:19:41] unless you got a different Revelation
[1:19:43] than mine but my Revelation is that
[1:19:47] Jehovah of the Old Testament it's Jesus
[1:19:50] Christ of the new there is not a second
[1:19:52] person or third person there's only one
[1:19:55] person and if that one person exists in
[1:19:58] me he acts the same way
[1:20:18] when Satan can take your job how about
[1:20:22] my notes now when Satan can take your
[1:20:25] job
[1:20:27] he's defeated
[1:20:34] Hallelujah
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:34] God he did not look at circumstances he
[1:21:38] looked at the promises of the word
[1:21:40] hallelujah and he gave us a word
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:51] I don't know about you but I am a
[1:21:54] believer
[1:21:55] Hallelujah I am a believer

[1:22:04] do you have valid sometimes yeah
[1:22:08] oh yeah sometimes are you are you in a
[1:22:11] dark place sometimes yes
[1:22:13] but one thing I realized
[1:22:16] he's my shepherd
[1:22:18] if I'm in a dark place he led me there
[1:22:22] yeah Hallelujah if I'm sick he allowed
[1:22:27] it to be soaked Hallelujah but one thing
[1:22:31] I know this message has made me and that
[1:22:34] is an overcomer
[1:22:36] Hallelujah I'm more than overcome
[1:22:41] you this morning
[1:22:47] I preached not long ago you take the
[1:22:50] challenge you don't wait till the devil
[1:22:52] come back at you you take the challenge
[1:22:55] is that right it was David and his
[1:22:58] brothers
[1:23:00] running from Dave uh Goliath Hallelujah
[1:23:05] but David took it took the battle to the
[1:23:08] Giants
[1:23:15] I can't help but to use my own
[1:23:17] testimonies how God may have gave me
[1:23:19] Victory you know why because I refuse me
[1:23:23] I don't care
[1:23:29] to let him become a winner of Victor
[1:23:30] over me
[1:23:33] if it means I've got a fight
[1:23:37] and fight and fight Hallelujah I am a
[1:23:42] Victor
[1:23:43] it's not me like Paul said it's not I
[1:23:47] that lives but it's Christ that lives in
[1:23:50] me
[1:23:54] Hallelujah man what I'm I'm in the book
[1:23:58] you should see the relief you're in the
[1:24:00] book
[1:24:01] Hallelujah I understand where I'm
[1:24:03] standing there's a component this is not
[1:24:05] some kind of thing where I've got to
[1:24:06] feel God
[1:24:07] we always say I feel him in my soul we
[1:24:11] don't feel God in our souls
[1:24:16] there ain't no feeling in your soul yep
[1:24:18] I do feel them in my soul
[1:24:23] there's no feeling in your soul and God
[1:24:26] purposed it to be that way
[1:24:29] because he does not want you to go by
[1:24:31] your feelings
[1:24:35] hello
[1:24:37] he don't want you going by your feet oh
[1:24:39] I feel those your song I don't feel like
[1:24:42] I'm saved sometimes
[1:24:46] see ain't hardly nobody said amen
[1:24:50] I don't feel safe sometimes
[1:24:52] what your feelings got to do with that
[1:24:55] feeling has nothing to do
[1:24:58] the devil can use your feelings anytime
[1:25:01] is that all right it's not about
[1:25:05] feelings
[1:25:07] faith is a revelation let me ask you a
[1:25:11] question because I'm trying to I'm
[1:25:12] trying to bring you up
[1:25:13] Hallelujah faith is a revelation
[1:25:16] Hallelujah let me ask you a question
[1:25:20] how come you believe this message
[1:25:25] what made you believe it
[1:25:28] well because daddy gave it to you this
[1:25:30] is Mama gave it to you
[1:25:33] let me tell you something this is not a
[1:25:35] second-handed religion
[1:25:38] for yourself
[1:25:42] and people think because I'm so deep I
[1:25:47] understand the opening up the words
[1:25:55] I know all those things I know how many
[1:25:59] trips brother Brianna made and how many
[1:26:00] rabbits he shot
[1:26:09] just like a brother showed me the other
[1:26:10] day
[1:26:11] a man who said I love brother Brandon
[1:26:15] more than I love Jesus Christ
[1:26:17] that man ain't even say it's a dominant
[1:26:19] box and let me tell you something about
[1:26:21] her if I have to hear if I was in the
[1:26:23] church if somebody said that they would
[1:26:26] hear the door open boom
[1:26:29] they wouldn't even see me
[1:26:32] I'll be running out there with all I've
[1:26:34] got
[1:26:35] y'all understand me William random must
[1:26:38] have been our Prophet but let me tell
[1:26:40] you something I'll save you as Jesus
[1:26:43] Christ
[1:26:45] how can you Lobster you most of the
[1:26:48] people in it you've never met William
[1:26:50] Brown
[1:26:51] Hallelujah and William Branham cannot
[1:26:54] occupy your soul
[1:26:57] but Jesus Christ Jesus the one that
[1:27:01] occupies your soul so how can you love
[1:27:04] something more than the man who occupies
[1:27:14] that's nonsense this is your nonsense
[1:27:18] I don't know
[1:27:21] I don't heard a lot of things but that
[1:27:22] was more bizarre than anything
[1:27:26] oh God
[1:27:29] let me tell you something
[1:27:33] those of us who
[1:27:37] something else so you can understand
[1:27:39] you can't stay where you are
[1:27:43] spiritually you cannot stay where you
[1:27:46] are and expect to make a Rapture I
[1:27:50] didn't say you wasn't saved I'm saying
[1:27:52] you cannot stay where you are still the
[1:27:56] Holy Ghost the spirit of Christ in you
[1:27:59] he's going to take you higher
[1:28:04] he's going to take you higher you
[1:28:07] understand me and if you're standing
[1:28:09] still this is what you call backslidden
[1:28:13] you gotta grow in the grace of God
[1:28:17] hallelujah now I don't know I'm off my
[1:28:20] nose but the thing about it let me come
[1:28:22] down to this
[1:28:25] because the Bible says if you can't love
[1:28:29] your brother
[1:28:33] Montana
[1:28:54] then you did
[1:28:55] you're deep when you can love your
[1:28:58] enemies
[1:28:59] when you can love those that the
[1:29:02] unlovable your jeans
[1:29:04] deeply in love with him
[1:29:08] hallelujah
[1:29:10] amen now here I'm going now I'm almost
[1:29:12] done
[1:29:13] I'm a little over but let me go go
[1:29:16] anyway yeah I'll continue
[1:29:18] how many of y'all would come back to
[1:29:20] second service
[1:29:22] that's what I thought
[1:29:24] so
[1:29:28] so give me a few more minutes
[1:29:31] amen well at least you're honestly
[1:29:37] one thing about Abraham's seeds
[1:29:40] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:29:59] glory to God
[1:30:04] and this is the part on the 21st verse
[1:30:09] and being full
[1:30:13] blend conviction that what he what he
[1:30:15] promised for me he was able also to
[1:30:19] perform
[1:30:21] you know this is the way I look at it
[1:30:24] in brother Brown's Ministry the Lord
[1:30:28] raised the Dead
[1:30:30] Brother Brown
[1:30:32] the Lord healed cancer
[1:30:36] the Lord uncrossed eyes
[1:30:45] God even
[1:30:47] extended limbs how do you all know that
[1:30:49] right given uh extended limbs
[1:30:52] Hallelujah is that right
[1:30:55] in brown Obama's Ministry amen God even
[1:30:58] heal club foot feet I mean
[1:31:01] um
[1:31:02] there was nothing
[1:31:04] there was no challenge
[1:31:05] everything the devil can God cast out
[1:31:09] Devils
[1:31:12] so much Soul he described what these
[1:31:15] demons look like
[1:31:17] hello somebody
[1:31:22] foreign
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:19] but the pride of Jesus Christ has a
[1:32:23] measure of discernment
[1:32:29] all of the signs and wonders
[1:32:32] we don't seek them but they're supposed
[1:32:35] to follow us
[1:32:38] I'm persuaded
[1:32:40] this old boy and I'm gonna tell you
[1:32:43] something Satan has been attacking my
[1:32:46] mind like he's never attacked it before
[1:32:51] and just the other day it was bad I was
[1:32:55] tired I suffered in my spirit
[1:32:59] so many things were going on
[1:33:02] because it was like almost dimensional I
[1:33:06] could hear people thoughts
[1:33:08] and it just seemed like Satan was just
[1:33:11] coming at me in such a way
[1:33:13] you know I was at my home I mean my wife
[1:33:17] not understanding what's going on with
[1:33:19] me
[1:33:20] but God led me to this message he began
[1:33:24] to bring something to me he began to
[1:33:27] revive Me by and through the word of God
[1:33:30] he made me remember who I really am what
[1:33:35] I'm here for
[1:33:39] hello
[1:33:41] and he also reminded me
[1:33:44] no weapon
[1:33:46] formed against you foreign
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:13] evolutionary
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:20] how many all believe I noticed why but
[1:34:23] I'm trying to encourage you like God
[1:34:25] encouraged me
[1:34:27] let God break the chains
[1:34:32] every one of us come from different
[1:34:34] places
[1:34:35] we come to the message
[1:34:38] and I guess we try to uh incorporate
[1:34:42] a lot of things into the message that's
[1:34:44] not even there
[1:34:47] all that stuff got to go
[1:34:50] you will never be free until you let it
[1:34:52] all go y'all hear what I'm saying I'm
[1:34:56] trying to tell you you'll never be free
[1:34:58] until you let it all go my point is you
[1:35:01] need to know Jesus Christ
[1:35:05] I only know one thing and that Jesus
[1:35:09] Christ and him crucified and I'm gonna
[1:35:11] know him I just don't want to know him
[1:35:13] in the power of his resurrection but I
[1:35:16] want to know him in his suffering as
[1:35:17] well
[1:35:18] that's when you know you know you love
[1:35:20] him
[1:35:21] so we're coming down to the end of the
[1:35:23] message
[1:35:27] you know what God did for us
[1:35:31] he declared righteousness
[1:35:35] by his grace
[1:35:39] and I'm gonna say it like this again
[1:35:41] when you have come through a church
[1:35:45] all the churches and about laws and
[1:35:48] rules and regulations
[1:35:52] literally killing you
[1:35:54] it's literally putting you in bondage in
[1:35:57] prison books
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:02] some things preachers preach on yeah if
[1:36:06] you had the Holy Ghost he would never
[1:36:09] have to preach on it
[1:36:12] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:36:17] for example
[1:36:19] the Bible says two can't walk together
[1:36:22] except they agree
[1:36:24] um
[1:36:26] yeah all of us are in here
[1:36:44] foreign hmm
[1:36:47] we go to we go to work
[1:36:50] we're
[1:36:52] unbelieversion and people say don't you
[1:36:54] have nothing to do with them
[1:36:57] they ain't Christianity
[1:37:01] and so you carry yourself out of
[1:37:05] um like you're so much better
[1:37:09] and you think they want your
[1:37:11] Christianity
[1:37:12] they do not
[1:37:15] I wouldn't want it
[1:37:19] you know what Jesus did so that's
[1:37:21] because she's very Faith he knew he saw
[1:37:23] a woman at the well
[1:37:26] and he went to Fellowship in Italy
[1:37:29] community
[1:37:30] y'all hear me there was a woman in
[1:37:34] Simon's house
[1:37:36] now y'all gotta know that look bad
[1:37:41] now y'all know what I'm saying it looked
[1:37:45] real bad
[1:37:47] it's Simon's house
[1:37:51] it looked just as bad as it did
[1:37:56] when that couple was on the front row no
[1:37:58] school
[1:37:59] and brother Brown was meeting
[1:38:03] out that's what he said so busy and he
[1:38:07] was this woman in Simon's house who
[1:38:11] everybody knew she was a prostitute
[1:38:17] amen washing his feet
[1:38:22] crying I don't know about you but if I
[1:38:27] had seen that message
[1:38:28] in my natural mind I probably would have
[1:38:32] thought well you know he knows she knows
[1:38:33] him
[1:38:35] they must have just had a breakup
[1:38:41] I'm just saying in my natural mind
[1:38:44] I would have thought something was going
[1:38:46] on
[1:38:49] but Jesus cared nothing about it
[1:38:52] he knew that
[1:39:13] about Jesus Christ
[1:39:17] if you can't do that you don't need to
[1:39:20] be with them
[1:39:21] oh come on somebody but what I'm trying
[1:39:24] to say is that you'll never win somebody
[1:39:26] to church
[1:39:29] with your religious mind
[1:39:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:39:40] I have friends right now
[1:39:44] who are dominational Christians he's on
[1:39:47] the the Chris they come to my house even
[1:39:50] during his own they've listened to a few
[1:39:52] messages
[1:39:53] they can't see it
[1:39:56] at this point
[1:39:58] what am I supposed to do because
[1:40:02] I ain't got nothing else to do with it
[1:40:05] you see what we do when God took all
[1:40:09] that time with you
[1:40:11] to make you see this message
[1:40:14] and we want to judge somebody because we
[1:40:16] give them a book and they say hey it
[1:40:18] ain't for me it may not be for them at
[1:40:21] that time
[1:40:24] you don't cut them off you allowed them
[1:40:28] to see the Christ in you
[1:40:34] hmm y'all think I'm crazy
[1:40:37] no I'm not
[1:40:39] because let me tell y'all something and
[1:40:41] I'm getting ready to close I'm closing
[1:40:43] now for real my message went totally
[1:40:45] different
[1:40:46] but let me tell you like this there's
[1:40:48] someone with Jacob CC
[1:40:50] sometimes we do things we're not aware
[1:40:52] of it the fund is on the shoulders
[1:40:55] is that right is it why
[1:40:59] now I'm gonna say it like this
[1:41:01] my wife and I can't speak French my
[1:41:03] father wanted
[1:41:07] but there have been times before we've
[1:41:10] been left out
[1:41:14] don't get quiet
[1:41:16] it's true and y'all know we don't speak
[1:41:20] Frenchie
[1:41:22] but then many of you won't even stand up
[1:41:24] and say hey I I interpret foreign
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:38] I want to laugh too
[1:41:42] but what I'm saying will do that
[1:41:45] not realizing the brother that other
[1:41:47] sister that's left out
[1:41:49] she walks away feeling bad
[1:41:54] walk away feeling unloved in me I don't
[1:41:58] know I can speak for myself
[1:42:00] like man them people don't respect me
[1:42:10] now point is this
[1:42:11] more point
[1:42:13] somebody raised up would be an
[1:42:15] interpreter yeah yeah
[1:42:17] somebody need to raise up and be an
[1:42:19] interval yeah
[1:42:23] Hallelujah
[1:42:25] and and you know what can I say it like
[1:42:27] this those who speaks wild healing can't
[1:42:30] speak French somebody need to raise up
[1:42:33] and be an interpreter
[1:42:36] nobody likes to be left out
[1:42:44] foreign
[1:42:54] okay
[1:42:56] it's a true it's everyday
[1:43:02] I'm gonna stop
[1:43:05] because I want y'all to see how simple
[1:43:07] things can be and how people have their
[1:43:10] own little prejudices and don't even
[1:43:12] know it come on this is that right
[1:43:16] you know I'm saying this we we're
[1:43:19] covered by the blood
[1:43:22] and I believe with all my heart because
[1:43:24] I can't judge you but you'll be perfect
[1:43:26] I don't know who you are but I'm
[1:43:28] believing that everybody in here will be
[1:43:29] his bride that God is going to somehow
[1:43:32] bring us all together
[1:43:34] I believe that that's why I work so hard
[1:43:39] on the thing I want to see us Unified
[1:43:45] but I can see I can see that this Union
[1:43:48] is not there I can't do it
[1:43:52] I can't do it it takes you evil you have
[1:43:57] to do it
[1:43:58] she don't speak to me I ain't gonna
[1:44:00] speak to her
[1:44:02] good luck with that oh
[1:44:07] I tell you one thing what brother random
[1:44:08] says when that pressure and squeeze come
[1:44:11] on
[1:44:12] we're not going to worry about what your
[1:44:14] Doctrine is
[1:44:16] you're going to be so glad to see a
[1:44:18] Christian
[1:44:20] Hallelujah he ain't gonna say who Church
[1:44:25] who's Pastor your pastors
[1:44:28] not passing the message I don't know
[1:44:30] where yours is true
[1:44:35] you see what I'm saying let me ask you
[1:44:38] something any questions I'm almost done
[1:44:42] I'm Gonna Let You Go cause I know I can
[1:44:44] feel it
[1:44:47] I can feel it
[1:44:52] how many of you
[1:44:54] can truly say
[1:44:57] that you see yourself Growing Experience
[1:45:07] let me tell y'all something listen I
[1:45:10] don't believe like some of these people
[1:45:11] believe just push play
[1:45:15] but I do believe in push and play
[1:45:22] listen
[1:45:25] those tapes is a voice for a reason
[1:45:30] it's not just book only but voice
[1:45:33] I have been healed
[1:45:36] by listening to those tapes
[1:45:39] I have been delivered delivery by
[1:45:43] listening to those times
[1:45:44] see I don't see a man I see a god coming
[1:45:49] through those tapes
[1:45:52] it's really it's the word in voice form
[1:45:56] we are such a privileged privilege
[1:46:03] privileged some privilege that we can
[1:46:06] see that
[1:46:08] and I'm gonna tell you like this
[1:46:09] somebody said to me they don't like the
[1:46:12] way he sounded God ain't ask you to like
[1:46:13] the way he sounds
[1:46:17] um God did not say you're going to like
[1:46:20] the way he was supposed to sound
[1:46:22] working with the sound he's working with
[1:46:25] the words
[1:46:30] I've been trying to come off this plane
[1:46:34] where I'm at right now
[1:46:37] my Earnest desires
[1:46:41] to see a church unifies
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:46] when I was in Lime Ohio
[1:46:48] I'm not comparing Papa
[1:46:53] but I started out with 13 people
[1:46:59] they were all old
[1:47:03] as far as tithing is concerned
[1:47:06] I may have been getting like 500 a month
[1:47:11] that carried almost for years he said
[1:47:15] but did I quit man scripture is stupid I
[1:47:18] didn't care about the money
[1:47:20] my supplier is not been Ben Franklin or
[1:47:24] whoever
[1:47:25] my Supply is Jesus Christ
[1:47:29] you see
[1:47:31] my thought is this I'm going to work I'm
[1:47:35] going to do all I can
[1:47:37] to be a blessing to this church
[1:47:40] to help you as much as I can and as much
[1:47:45] as the Lord will allow me the preaching
[1:47:47] the word that will bring us into Oneness
[1:47:50] because I realized if I continue to
[1:47:54] preach this way
[1:47:57] you know what I'm saying getting kind of
[1:48:00] like into your life
[1:48:03] you're going to either stay or you're
[1:48:05] going to leave
[1:48:07] but I know one thing about the Bride of
[1:48:09] Jesus Christ
[1:48:11] she wants to be corrected
[1:48:17] I don't know about you I want to be
[1:48:18] correct
[1:48:20] I don't want nothing following me
[1:48:25] I don't want a truckload of sin coming
[1:48:27] behind me
[1:48:29] you understand me I want everything up
[1:48:32] front
[1:48:33] like that old man say I don't want no
[1:48:36] trouble at the river
[1:48:39] in closing God
[1:48:44] if he'd given you a battle see Jules are
[1:48:47] called during bad day he know you can
[1:48:49] beat it
[1:48:50] if there's a battle in your life he
[1:48:54] knows you are the Victor he's secretary
[1:48:56] he knows you can overcome he knows every
[1:49:00] battle is hamstring hand designed for
[1:49:04] you it it for me I can't fight your
[1:49:08] battles and you can't fight mine but
[1:49:11] every battle you go through has been
[1:49:13] personalized
[1:49:16] but God also know if you said you're
[1:49:19] going to come out as a winner
[1:49:23] less than live on
[1:49:30] I trust Mrs Bell
[1:49:40] let everybody understand
[1:49:44] brother Brandon said only perfect love
[1:49:46] foreign
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:11] is something about flowers
[1:50:15] when the flower has nectar in it those
[1:50:17] screw the the floor that sweet stuff
[1:50:22] um it never has to put a sign out there
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:32] um no the bird leaves the beef leaves
[1:50:37] everything that love nectar it's going
[1:50:40] to come and get dip into that flower why
[1:50:45] because that nectar was made for them
[1:50:47] that's how it is
[1:50:49] we are supposed to be lilies and some
[1:50:52] people said the floor
[1:50:54] is that right
[1:50:55] and we understand a crush Lily
[1:50:58] it's what brings us
[1:51:08] to be a Christian foreign
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:14] oh
[1:51:15] may God help us let's continue to say we
[1:51:18] all need more of him
[1:51:20] I wasn't here to criticize you
[1:51:23] but I'm here to open and bring a word
[1:51:27] that may allow us to see where we're
[1:51:29] standing here maybe I'm the only one but
[1:51:32] that you should have but I really
[1:51:34] believe that we're not so far from the
[1:51:38] translation
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:41] we're all ready it's on the moon in
[1:51:44] World War Three
[1:51:45] because the bomb haven't dropped here
[1:51:48] doesn't mean the bomb is not coming
[1:51:50] Hallelujah
[1:51:53] is that right she said why well think
[1:51:55] about the Saints over there in Ukraine
[1:51:57] how would they interpret that before one
[1:52:01] bomb dropped a Vulcan bomb will be gone
[1:52:05] how would they interpret that when the
[1:52:08] bombs are dropping brother was referring
[1:52:11] to with this United States
[1:52:14] before one bomb drops the Bride of Jesus
[1:52:18] Christ will be gone it's already in the
[1:52:21] East it's going to travel to the West
[1:52:25] so we better refocus
[1:52:27] that's more important Jesus Christ
