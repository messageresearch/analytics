[9:54] standing there and how the Lord showed
[9:56] me that that he knows his joy now he has
[10:02] for him he's very powerful I many times
[10:06] I know that the Lord has received my joy
[10:13] my clap or the joy and my shout to him
[10:19] someone that doesn't have that
[10:21] experience may think that's I'm doing it
[10:24] for me I'm doing it to the Lord and he
[10:27] showed me he's told me I know your joy
[10:30] for me this past week when the service
[10:33] Wednesday I never had experienced the
[10:39] sorrow God has for those who turn their
[10:43] back on him and do things contrary to
[10:45] him and he let me see his sorrow
[10:49] I pray that that's a something that you
[10:57] want to know my desires that please God

[37:19] [Music]
[37:24] hey man hallelujah
[37:32] as we stand we're going to come from
[37:39] Jeremiah again Jeremiah the first
[37:41] chapter there will come from Jeremiah
[37:44] the second chapter those of you who were
[37:48] here on Wednesday we preached on the
[37:52] message the cry of God's heart and we
[37:57] just kind of want to pick up again and
[37:59] move with it by God's grace I believe
[38:02] that we're living in the last days I
[38:04] believe that many people are forgetting
[38:07] the reason why you were called the voice
[38:11] of Matthew 25 tells us that that we
[38:16] there was a bridegroom that called our
[38:19] virgins and I really believe that many
[38:23] of us have forgotten what this message
[38:26] have called us to and I believe that if
[38:30] we're not careful we may be endangering
[38:34] our souls or endangering ourselves to
[38:37] missing the rapture so let us go to
[38:44] Jeremiah the first chapter we'll read
[38:47] there at the 16th verse of that first
[38:52] chapter
[38:54] Jeremiah 116 you see brother Balaam when
[39:00] he left he left us a word a message and
[39:04] that message itself is Jesus Christ if
[39:08] you don't see Jesus Christ you missed
[39:10] the message and for Jeremiah 116 and I
[39:17] will out of my judgment against them
[39:20] touching all their wickedness who have
[39:24] forsaken me and have burned it sent unto
[39:28] other gods and worship the works of
[39:32] their hands
[39:36] Jeremiah 2:19 dine own wickedness shall
[39:49] corrupt thee and thy backsliding shall
[39:53] reprove thee know therefore and see that
[39:56] it is an evil thing and bitter that thou
[40:00] forsaken the LORD thy God and that my
[40:04] fear is not in thee and the Lord God
[40:08] saith the Lord God of hosts
[40:12] let us pray Lord we come before your
[40:19] Lord is humbly as we know how
[40:23] Lord we pray that you move us out of
[40:28] ourselves and we pray that you would
[40:31] move within us father we pray that you
[40:36] would speak to your people hallelujah
[40:39] speak to me I need you Jesus give us
[40:43] your grace and your mercy Lord we do
[40:46] believe with all of our heart that you
[40:49] were here this morning because you said
[40:52] where two or three are gathered in your
[40:54] name you're there in the missing forgive
[40:57] us and cleanse us from anything that we
[40:59] may have done that would hinder the
[41:01] service hinder the message father speak
[41:04] to your hearts of your people we ask
[41:06] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[41:08] pray amen
[41:10] you may be seated one of the things that
[41:16] really caught my attention this morning
[41:19] was the very fact of one of the events
[41:22] that is happening out in California you
[41:27] see often time we feel safe and secure
[41:30] when we don't really know what tomorrow
[41:34] will bring
[41:35] sometimes we forget that we are children
[41:40] of God and we've come to make the world
[41:44] know that Jesus Christ lives and
[41:48] we we just want to say by God's grace
[41:51] that when it comes to respect that you
[41:55] and I we forget as I said on the other
[42:00] day Wednesday night we look at me we
[42:06] look at brother Brooks and sometimes we
[42:08] forget who's really standing in the
[42:10] pulpit we we we fail to see the God
[42:15] hides himself behind human flesh and so
[42:20] therefore we don't fear one another and
[42:24] fear is not what I want you to do when
[42:27] it comes to me but you ought to fear the
[42:29] God that I serve there's an event that
[42:33] just took place the other day in
[42:35] California and a fire and some of you
[42:40] may have heard about the fire started
[42:42] out as a campfire it went in destroyed
[42:45] towns this fire did but I I want to read
[42:50] something that these elderly people said
[42:53] who were trapped in this fire and God
[42:57] allowed them to escape this place was
[43:05] known for its beauty and he says on the
[43:10] main road that locals affectionately
[43:17] called the sky way to paradise and many
[43:24] of those trapped in the nerve-racking
[43:28] slow-motion evacuation Thursday morning
[43:35] their prayers I'm sorry that day that
[43:43] morning their prayers and I'm sure they
[43:45] prayed and they wondered is this the end
[43:50] the one couple said I thought this must
[43:53] be what hell is going to be the this was
[44:00] the 87 year old person says Beverly feel
[44:05] more who drove out of paradise with her
[44:09] 91 year old husband Jim they said we
[44:14] were going to be create cremated when we
[44:18] die but I thought this is it I'm going
[44:23] to be cremated right now and this is
[44:27] when I die all I could think about was
[44:32] the unexpected the unexpected always get
[44:36] us things that we don't expect when we
[44:42] later
[44:42] Lahey's and I and that's when troubles
[44:45] come and here were people trapped in
[44:50] their cars trying to escape and the fire
[44:55] the wind shifted and many of them died
[44:59] in the fire in their car trying to
[45:04] escape on a road that led to sky way to
[45:09] paradise nothing happens by chance
[45:15] God ordains everything but in our minds
[45:21] we sometimes think that we are beyond
[45:27] retribution beyond chastisement
[45:34] sometimes we think that God don't see us
[45:38] it is so amazing because we have had our
[45:42] example I think some
[45:47] we forget that God has feelings we
[45:52] become like Israel God don't care God
[45:55] don't see and I'm gonna get away with it
[46:01] remember brother Branham had the spirit
[46:04] of Elijah and that light that spirit
[46:09] also was a spirit of judgment Elijah
[46:15] gave Jezebel her judgment God gave
[46:21] Jezebel space to repent and she would
[46:24] not repent God will give you space to
[46:27] repent we did not come to establish a
[46:32] church and one of the things that God
[46:36] even wants all of us to see is that he
[46:39] wants us united with him Oh has failed
[46:44] us
[46:45] yo flesh will fail you but we must
[46:51] realize that God gets tired you say he
[46:55] doesn't he gets weary of repenting
[47:04] that's what you prophesy God gets weary
[47:08] of repenting we realize
[47:15] that brother Bantam even talked on the
[47:19] level of Hebrew 10 when you cross that
[47:25] line of no repentance when you have
[47:32] continually go in the way of air and God
[47:38] has continually warned you about it
[47:41] and you continually fail to repent God
[47:48] said he'd give you over to a reprobate
[47:50] mind many of us fail to see that God
[47:57] took Israel and used her as an example
[48:03] when God chose us as bride he chose us
[48:07] to have a love affair this message is
[48:12] not to be a burden it is to be an affair
[48:19] with God it is to be in such a union
[48:24] with him
[48:25] that you could feel him you could you
[48:28] would know his desires for you
[48:31] before we even speak you would know what
[48:35] he wants from you every prophet was the
[48:42] cry of God in the days of Noah when God
[48:46] tried to get the people to repent they
[48:49] would not they found so many things to
[48:53] do they loved pleasure they loved
[48:56] prosperity they loved everything that
[48:59] God was able to supply them with but
[49:04] they didn't love God my question is do
[49:07] you love him
[49:09] where is your heart where is your love
[49:14] for him that you would do anything for
[49:15] him can you feel what he's feeling to
[49:19] know that he sent Malachi for the Elijah
[49:24] for our day and we
[49:28] can't hardly see the results of that
[49:31] message a super Church a supernatural
[49:36] Church a church in his very image a
[49:40] church in his very likeness brother
[49:44] Branham said it'll be a wonder if this
[49:46] many out of this age would make it 10
[49:53] people would make it out of this 8 which
[50:02] of these are you and if he said it there
[50:09] must be a reality to it look at all the
[50:15] people now that we have claiming to
[50:18] follow Malachi 4 or the message that he
[50:21] brought but how many of us sitting here
[50:26] this morning really know Jesus we know
[50:29] his name
[50:30] we may even know his position with God
[50:33] we may know him as a slave he he came to
[50:36] save you but is he yours
[50:40] the you and I must realize I'm just
[50:43] gonna have to quote this you and I must
[50:47] realize Amen that God word will not
[50:51] change for you God's Word will not
[50:55] change for me we say the rapture is
[50:59] coming and yet we've got ministers
[51:01] building big buildings and big programs
[51:04] and all of these things it has gotten so
[51:08] bad that people are confused of what the
[51:13] message really is the message is not
[51:18] books and tapes the message is you
[51:23] it starts out on books and tapes but if
[51:28] you don't eat it if you don't consume it
[51:31] and if it comes apart of you you must
[51:35] become the message
[51:41] that's why we have preachers so they can
[51:45] catch the inspiration of God is that
[51:48] right
[51:48] God said every by the way of the Prophet
[51:51] God said every modern day preacher is a
[51:55] prophet he's not a major one but he's a
[51:59] prophet what is he doing resounding what
[52:03] has already been said but putting it in
[52:07] a place that you can digest it that you
[52:11] can get the revelation of what he's
[52:13] saying I had to say God interprets his
[52:22] own word by bringing it to pass so my
[52:26] question is what is God bringing to pass
[52:29] in your life some intellectual concept
[52:35] just knowing the message I know what he
[52:38] said but are you living what he said he
[52:44] read about knowing the devil knows what
[52:46] he's saying it's about living what he
[52:49] said many we look we see something's
[52:59] happening in the spirit this thing is
[53:01] turning and a lot of us don't even see
[53:03] it we're too busy too distracted with
[53:07] all kinds of things is that right and
[53:11] there the Bible says in the day of Noah
[53:15] they were eating drinking being married
[53:20] giving him that what was those things
[53:23] they were distractions
[53:26] it wasn't anything wrong with those
[53:29] things is God wants you to have joy God
[53:31] wants you to have peace God wants you to
[53:33] get married but with those speeds become
[53:35] prioritize and above God he's not happy
[53:42] with it
[53:47] divine healing brother Ellen said this
[53:50] he that sins willfully after receiving
[53:52] the knowledge of the truth there
[53:57] remaineth no sacrifice for sin Hebrews
[54:01] 10 I believe right is that sin willfully
[54:05] he that sins willfully after receiving
[54:07] the knowledge of the truth there
[54:10] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but
[54:13] a fearful looking forward the fire to
[54:17] the judgment and fierce indignation
[54:20] which shall devour the adversaries my
[54:25] question my thought my thought is this
[54:28] you and I know that we will not make a
[54:31] rapture i'ma go tear without the Holy
[54:34] Ghost people said well how do I get it
[54:37] listen to the Word of God amen the
[54:39] prophet of God a priest I don't know how
[54:42] many times God provided way you want to
[54:45] know how to get it go listen but you
[54:48] don't listen just to gain knowledge you
[54:51] listen to act upon what you've heard
[54:57] hello if we had the Holy Ghost
[55:01] like we say we have we wouldn't have the
[55:04] problems that we say we had divine love
[55:11] is what we must reach how many of you
[55:16] how many of us can say we have it how
[55:21] many of us are trying to press into that
[55:23] statue of Christ where we're totally
[55:27] dead and rot and God is living in us or
[55:30] are we trying to cause division now he
[55:36] that what willfully he that sins and
[55:41] what is sin unbelief he that will turn
[55:45] his back on truth when it's presented to
[55:48] him they remain normal sacrifice for sin
[55:53] did you ever read that like that see he
[55:56] that disbelieved willfully at the truth
[56:00] at
[56:01] been presented to him because his church
[56:03] believe different that's when you cross
[56:06] the line he that seems willfully after
[56:10] he has received the knowledge of the
[56:12] truth there remaineth no more sacrifice
[56:15] divine healing in 1954 now he's calling
[56:20] out his crying out to the church people
[56:23] you weren't here some of you weren't
[56:24] here wisdom brother man take this
[56:26] message did not come to shake the world
[56:29] it came to shake the church it came to
[56:35] shake the church and there is a shaking
[56:38] right now there is a shaking and if
[56:42] there is a shaking what's coming next
[56:47] what's coming next we sit here and we
[56:52] carry on and we really religiously come
[56:56] the church but that ain't it
[56:59] there are thousands of 1000s of
[57:03] so-called Christian that goes to church
[57:05] faithfully and they're going to miss
[57:07] this rapture God want a relationship
[57:14] God wants out of you out of you out of
[57:18] me God wants a love affair he doesn't
[57:23] want this religious stuff we handing him
[57:25] is that right the Bible said that even
[57:28] Israel religiously gave God what he
[57:33] requires and it was stench in his
[57:36] nostrils it made him sick but because it
[57:41] was religiously done God don't need your
[57:45] religion God wants your love hallelujah
[57:55] did you know that you
[57:57] be a prostitute without ever
[58:00] prostituting your physical body brother
[58:05] madam says listen he said prostitutions
[58:07] don't mean sexually every time you can
[58:12] prostitute your time you can prostitute
[58:15] your faith go out and join some cult or
[58:18] some old former Church you're a
[58:22] prostitute wait a minute he used the
[58:25] term formal church so if it's formal it
[58:31] means God ain't there huh
[58:38] if this formal that means God is not
[58:40] there because we're the Spirit of the
[58:43] Lord is there is Liberty
[58:46] we don't need Foreman formality in this
[58:50] place I'd rather see a wire fire than no
[58:54] fire at all that's the way God is weed
[58:59] this is not a classroom this is where
[59:01] God shows up you are see he said this is
[59:12] some old former church he said you're a
[59:15] prostitute you are you're just as guilty
[59:19] as she was but the same Lord Jesus that
[59:23] forgave her has the same pleading mercy
[59:25] for you tonight oh I tell you the truth
[59:30] we come in here and there's no joy
[59:32] what's wrong with the people joy is
[59:35] something you bring to God but we always
[59:39] come in like like like takers all we
[59:42] want to do is take from God God I need
[59:44] this Encarta need that and God I need
[59:46] that and we cannot even give God our
[59:48] worship or thank you into his gates with
[59:55] Thanksgiving into his courts with what
[59:58] praise the hard cry what was it those
[1:00:05] prophets heard and they felt God
[1:00:12] they knew what God was feeling because
[1:00:15] God and the property became one
[1:00:19] have you ever heard the message washing
[1:00:22] Jesus feet hallelujah or the unwelcome
[1:00:26] ha ha hey man God was crying through
[1:00:30] that prophet overwhelmed because he
[1:00:34] shows up for church and we won't even
[1:00:36] wash his feet how do you wash his feet
[1:00:42] by glorify Him your praising you you
[1:00:45] break up hallelujah you just let your
[1:00:48] emotions go with the love of God is that
[1:00:54] right you have to break through the
[1:00:56] crowd sometime you can't worry about how
[1:00:59] everybody else is seating I gotta be
[1:01:02] careful I'm trying good but we must pray
[1:01:05] through this is not a group this is not
[1:01:11] a group that God is redeeming God
[1:01:13] redeems individuals and somehow you must
[1:01:18] break through this formality overwhelm
[1:01:25] you Solomon 1 2 2 4 he says let me kiss
[1:01:37] let him kiss me with the kisses of his
[1:01:41] mouth for thy love is better than why
[1:01:46] because of the Savior of that good
[1:01:48] audience
[1:01:49] thy name is as ointment poured forth
[1:01:53] therefore do the Virgin's love being it
[1:01:57] doesn't seem like some starchy farmer
[1:02:00] church is going on here it seems like a
[1:02:03] relationship a fellowship and an
[1:02:07] intoxication is going on
[1:02:10] hallelujah stirred up by his presence
[1:02:15] that's the kind of relationship God
[1:02:17] wants did you know the Bible says
[1:02:21] kiss the son lest he be angry what do
[1:02:24] you mean kiss the son you better you
[1:02:27] better get this Holy Ghost or he gonna
[1:02:30] be angry draw be we were run after be
[1:02:36] the King have brought me into his
[1:02:39] chambers he will be glad and rejoice
[1:02:42] indeed we will remember thy love and
[1:02:46] more than wine the upright love thee now
[1:02:49] when the lassie brought you into his
[1:02:52] chambers or have you ever been there
[1:02:57] when God brings you into his chambers
[1:03:01] nothing else matters
[1:03:04] time doesn't matter how long I pray
[1:03:08] doesn't matter who's looking at me he
[1:03:10] doesn't matter nothing matters cuz
[1:03:15] you're caught up into that inspiration
[1:03:17] you caught up into that love hallelujah
[1:03:20] and all you want to do is please him why
[1:03:25] the Bible said it's my beloved
[1:03:27] hallelujah see we seek everything but
[1:03:31] him Jeremiah was a weeping prophet and
[1:03:36] God used him because God told Jeremiah
[1:03:39] I'm going to have you preaching and
[1:03:42] nobody is going to repent I've got a
[1:03:46] church Jeremiah for you but I've got a
[1:03:48] judge I'm just right and I've got a
[1:03:50] warning just right because I can't bring
[1:03:53] my judgments out the warning and
[1:03:56] Jeremiah I want you to preach it with
[1:03:58] all you've got spare not and cry loud
[1:04:02] right don't be afraid of their faces see
[1:04:09] when you begin to love souls like God
[1:04:12] love souls when you can feel God you
[1:04:16] began to witness the people and said
[1:04:18] don't you know the Lord is soon to come
[1:04:21] there used to be a time Amen that we we
[1:04:24] would commune with God on our beds y'all
[1:04:27] remember that do you remember how God
[1:04:30] was so precious to you that you almost
[1:04:32] couldn't go to sleep
[1:04:33] without thinking about him their time
[1:04:37] scripture would run through my head and
[1:04:38] you know that the very fact that I love
[1:04:41] God till I couldn't even sleep sometimes
[1:04:44] yeah the pray Lord just let me get a
[1:04:46] little bit to sleep I've gotta go to
[1:04:47] work now we don't even think about it
[1:04:53] we get on our knees thank you Jesus for
[1:04:57] today amen
[1:05:01] when we crawl in the bed all we say Lord
[1:05:05] I've been busy all day I'm so tired just
[1:05:07] let me lay in here and pray help us
[1:05:13] Jesus we need help the scripture said we
[1:05:18] used to meditate meditate Dave said I
[1:05:21] meditate on him both day and night I
[1:05:24] think about his goodness both day and
[1:05:27] night I can't get to where her water but
[1:05:29] God helped me this morning cuz when
[1:05:33] Jeremiah was weeping he realized that
[1:05:35] all that preaching nobody was going to
[1:05:39] repent because God told him to told him
[1:05:43] so I will have you preaching to ask if
[1:05:46] me hard hearted people matter of fact
[1:05:49] they have crossed the line my judgment
[1:05:55] is already set for them I'm seeing the
[1:05:59] king from the north his name Amen he
[1:06:02] come and it'll be Babylon Nebuchadnezzar
[1:06:05] remember prophesied for years to come
[1:06:09] but there would be nobody that will
[1:06:11] repent not even the preachers reaches it
[1:06:15] is to preach us that causes the people
[1:06:18] to air it is to lead us because they
[1:06:23] they more concerned about your money and
[1:06:25] your possesses in the tons building give
[1:06:29] me three give me two people that really
[1:06:34] love God and will shake the city we
[1:06:38] don't need all of this
[1:06:40] God don't need all where two or three
[1:06:43] are gathered I'm in the Miss
[1:06:47] we don't you got a favor by coming to
[1:06:50] church you don't do me a favor by coming
[1:06:53] to church you should come the trucks
[1:06:56] because you love God and you love him
[1:07:00] with all your heart people you say what
[1:07:04] brother will do being rough my point is
[1:07:06] this is later than you think Psalms 101
[1:07:17] 24 2 to 4 sorry Psalms 101 imma be
[1:07:22] second to the fourth verse
[1:07:24] I will behave myself wisely in a perfect
[1:07:28] way
[1:07:29] all when thou come unto me I will walk
[1:07:33] within my house with a perfect heart I
[1:07:38] will set no wicked things before mine I
[1:07:41] will help me Jesus internet TV no wicked
[1:07:48] thing hallelujah
[1:07:51] pornography no wicked thing I will set
[1:07:56] no weak I want to behave myself
[1:07:58] perfectly did you know the Bible says
[1:08:03] that if we have pleasure in those that
[1:08:06] do these evil deeds we are as guilty as
[1:08:10] they help us Jesus the point is we're
[1:08:17] all guilty of something and we all need
[1:08:23] to repent we all need to make right with
[1:08:28] God if you want to see God move you got
[1:08:32] to get right with God
[1:08:34] Paul a brother Brooks remember there was
[1:08:36] a story I can't recall exactly how it
[1:08:38] was but the Prophet tells us about how
[1:08:42] this lady came up to brother Branham and
[1:08:45] said brother Branham your message was so
[1:08:47] good that he didn't didn't he you didn't
[1:08:49] even touch me yeah
[1:08:53] and after the lady left there's another
[1:08:55] sister standing by
[1:08:57] and she said
[1:08:59] the brother Brandon the reason why your
[1:09:01] message didn't touch her is because you
[1:09:04] didn't preach on gossip says she was one
[1:09:09] of the biggest gossips around but you
[1:09:11] didn't hit that and that's exactly what
[1:09:16] people do they point fingers and they
[1:09:21] failed to see they got issues - the
[1:09:24] Bible said we all have come shot at the
[1:09:28] glory of God we need Jesus I need Jesus
[1:09:35] y'all be honest now with the amount of
[1:09:39] messages we have heard we should have
[1:09:42] taken a rapture by now you know it's
[1:09:47] true by the amount of messages we have
[1:09:50] heard preachers preach we should have
[1:09:53] taken a rapture by now hello
[1:09:57] what is the reason the Bible says they
[1:10:04] fell in the wilderness because the word
[1:10:08] they heard was not mixed with faith we
[1:10:14] still got people struggling with faith
[1:10:15] see if you get the Holy Ghost you won't
[1:10:19] have to worry about it the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:21] God and when God comes into you it's no
[1:10:25] longer your faith because you're dead
[1:10:26] it's his thing the just shall live by
[1:10:30] his faith not something here this is not
[1:10:35] his faith his faith is in you you become
[1:10:39] the faith of God that's why the Bible
[1:10:42] said all things are possible to them
[1:10:44] that believe
[1:10:46] cuz God cannot doubt his word hey but
[1:10:55] that's where the problem is
[1:10:57] Satan getting us with our eyes the
[1:11:00] things that we see the wicked things we
[1:11:03] look upon hello is that Alright listen
[1:11:08] he goes on and said a four word hard
[1:11:10] shell depart from me I
[1:11:13] will not know a wicked person you know
[1:11:20] God said I will not know a wicked person
[1:11:24] how would we've done great things in
[1:11:27] your name but you are a wicked person
[1:11:31] coming from the message it wasn't so
[1:11:34] from the beginning he said I feel sorry
[1:11:37] for people today many thousands of
[1:11:40] people in this nation that belongs to
[1:11:44] dozens of different churches trying to
[1:11:49] find where Jesus is they go down to one
[1:11:53] certain Church and they check their they
[1:11:57] go to another Church and they check
[1:11:59] their they find out that something's
[1:12:02] wrong
[1:12:03] they don't act like and believe like and
[1:12:06] worship life and there's no sound of the
[1:12:09] king in the camp yes we says there's no
[1:12:13] joy that's the sound when the king is in
[1:12:18] the camp
[1:12:19] hallelujah sure is in the cap when the
[1:12:23] King is that right
[1:12:24] even when Jesus rolled into Jerusalem on
[1:12:27] a donkey the people got excited
[1:12:30] hallelujah
[1:12:31] holds down a whole Santa blessed is he
[1:12:34] that comes in the name of the Lord and
[1:12:36] when I see y'all faces and there's no
[1:12:38] joy in your camp I realized that Jesus
[1:12:41] is not in your camp at the moment
[1:12:47] hallelujah
[1:12:48] I might say this if there was one thing
[1:12:51] I find in Pentecostal people that makes
[1:12:55] me believe that they are certainly
[1:12:56] outstanding Christians it's not because
[1:12:59] of their speaking with tongues or the
[1:13:02] sign of divine healing
[1:13:03] it's the joy that they have they just
[1:13:08] have no embarrassment they just let down
[1:13:12] their hair and start to rejoicing
[1:13:15] because they've got something hallelujah
[1:13:20] they're not a shame that makes me
[1:13:23] believe that there's something else
[1:13:26] thing about them they're not a shame
[1:13:28] they just as soon as shout out there in
[1:13:31] the street as they would hear in the
[1:13:34] church and if a hundred people were
[1:13:37] laughing at them that wouldn't stop them
[1:13:40] a bit up there continue on shouting joy
[1:13:44] for when one mission fails stars -
[1:13:48] excuse me
[1:13:50] find them on the mission fields starve
[1:13:53] to death almost now what listen see
[1:13:57] because even a when they hungry they
[1:13:59] still happy find them on the mission
[1:14:02] field starved to death almost I've seen
[1:14:06] them with no shoes on their feet living
[1:14:09] off of about 30 cents a week preaching
[1:14:13] the gospel brother just as happy as you
[1:14:17] are coming to a church in a limousine
[1:14:22] they are happy but they found something
[1:14:26] that means more than creed or domination
[1:14:31] or church affiliation they found it
[1:14:34] takes to be they found what it takes to
[1:14:37] be to bring joy and a Christian should
[1:14:40] be happy we were we were praying for
[1:14:43] that our joy might be full is something
[1:14:48] about it that's real now now if we've
[1:14:53] lost the job we've lost the things and
[1:14:56] we can't find them among our kindred we
[1:15:00] can't find them then there's one thing
[1:15:03] to do is to go back where we left him at
[1:15:08] hallelujah the church should go back to
[1:15:11] the beginning where they left him and
[1:15:14] that's exactly what Mary and Joseph did
[1:15:17] they loved Jesus at the feast of
[1:15:19] Pentecost and that's where Mary and
[1:15:21] Joseph left Jesus y'all understand me so
[1:15:26] listen you say I love him it was it was
[1:15:31] a death sentence to come into the
[1:15:34] presence of the king without the joy you
[1:15:37] could not come into the presence of the
[1:15:39] king being sad hallelujah often time God
[1:15:46] is mistaken because when God have
[1:15:49] confidence in you
[1:15:50] guess what he does send you through
[1:15:54] trials Oh God
[1:16:03] why me but not you
[1:16:08] you said Lord I want to be just like you
[1:16:12] like I said the other night but the
[1:16:15] venom tells a story about this young boy
[1:16:19] and he was following his daddy and his
[1:16:23] daddy was drunk and and he was just
[1:16:27] staggering like this and and then the
[1:16:32] daddy looked around and he saw his son
[1:16:40] what was the son doing following his
[1:16:44] daddy's footsteps hello and you and I
[1:16:51] must realize if we're gonna follow
[1:16:54] Christ the steps must be straight he
[1:16:57] said don't look to the left nor to the
[1:16:59] right keep your eye like a flint know
[1:17:04] that God has sent you here for a purpose
[1:17:07] but how would anybody this is what
[1:17:10] people uh there's a church of their
[1:17:13] ankeny adding on you rarely see a
[1:17:20] Catholic Church add-on or a Methodist
[1:17:23] Church anything this form will usually
[1:17:26] stay the way it is because it's dead
[1:17:32] can't get no farmer than a dead man he
[1:17:36] may look good he may even smell good
[1:17:37] whatever the case may be but he's dead
[1:17:40] my point is let me put it this way how
[1:17:45] many people you have run to Christ since
[1:17:48] you've been a Christian you come for
[1:17:53] reproduction you the woman hello and you
[1:18:00] must reproduce Christ not just in
[1:18:03] yourself but there must be enough of him
[1:18:05] to bring another one and another one and
[1:18:08] another one that's what you're here for
[1:18:12] not just enjoy the feast but you are
[1:18:15] here by God's grace to reproduce Christ
[1:18:18] on earth Jesus I'm gonna be too much
[1:18:29] longer but I want to say this by God's
[1:18:31] but I'm not done with this
[1:18:32] God is weeping if God could weep he will
[1:18:35] be weeping look what happened there at
[1:18:39] Lazarus look who came running to Mary oh
[1:18:43] Jesus Mary and Martha who had been spent
[1:18:48] plenty of time with him seeing the
[1:18:50] miracles understood him hallelujah and
[1:18:54] they still came not believing Lord if
[1:19:00] you had been here see brother Branham
[1:19:03] said they they had the right approach
[1:19:06] because God don't have to explain
[1:19:08] anything to us but they had the right
[1:19:11] approach y'all better listen to what I'm
[1:19:14] saying y'all people let me say like this
[1:19:16] this is America and Americans can't
[1:19:20] handle it
[1:19:21] I see the devil he meant sweeping people
[1:19:26] away
[1:19:27] hallelujah cuz you're not used to these
[1:19:29] demons these demons don't play these
[1:19:33] y'all better understand America has the
[1:19:35] worst demons in all the world she might
[1:19:39] have some riches but i'ma tell you
[1:19:41] something she's got demons from Sodom
[1:19:43] and Gomorrah
[1:19:44] she's got demons from
[1:19:46] NORs day she's got all those ant
[1:19:48] alluvion demons yeah
[1:19:51] y'all better get some Holy Ghost you
[1:19:55] better get God on the inside because if
[1:19:58] you don't get God on the inside
[1:20:00] Satan is gonna wipe your way like a
[1:20:02] flood you see how these fires demolish
[1:20:07] this so-called paradise maybe you think
[1:20:11] you're on the road a paradise but
[1:20:13] judgment came at an unexpected time by
[1:20:19] way of a wind so when God have
[1:20:28] confidence in you Oh Church don't you
[1:20:32] see where you made your mistake you've
[1:20:35] been born again but you did it daily in
[1:20:38] the world so you'll be born again but
[1:20:41] you did it daily in the world and the
[1:20:43] things of the world and God can't put
[1:20:45] confidence in you hello
[1:20:50] that's the reason great gifts are not in
[1:20:53] the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:20:55] Pentecostal and message I put that one
[1:20:57] on there it's because the character of
[1:21:01] the church
[1:21:02] it hasn't been pleasing to the Father I
[1:21:07] know this is hard but it's the truth
[1:21:11] let the great ransom Church of God
[1:21:14] straighten itself up and start back to
[1:21:17] believing in God the way they ought to
[1:21:20] and live like they ought to you'll see
[1:21:24] God come on the scene with everything he
[1:21:27] promised is that right break down the
[1:21:31] barriers and come in have fellowship and
[1:21:34] reason and love and preach and serve the
[1:21:37] Lord and see what will take place
[1:21:40] time-tested
[1:21:41] the Christians must be tested every son
[1:21:45] that comes to God must be first child
[1:21:48] trained tested when you go to build a
[1:21:51] building you test the material that you
[1:21:53] put in it when the great dam was built
[1:21:56] around you Jarrod you're out
[1:21:58] Jeff Lemire
[1:21:59] for the flood they tested every once
[1:22:03] tested every ounce of the dirt that
[1:22:05] winning that damn to see if it would
[1:22:08] stand the waters excuse me in God tells
[1:22:13] his children with trials and troubles
[1:22:16] tribulations to find out if they are
[1:22:18] truly his children the Bible said if we
[1:22:22] can't stand chastisement then we'll
[1:22:24] illegitimate children and not the
[1:22:27] children of God
[1:22:28] now notice then when the testing time
[1:22:32] come and they could stand the test I
[1:22:34] love that old song that people used to
[1:22:38] sing through many dangers toils and
[1:22:41] snares I have already come it was grace
[1:22:45] that brought me safe thus far and grace
[1:22:48] will take me off and then when the sons
[1:22:52] have had the order of adoption I say it
[1:22:55] like this
[1:22:56] his name was just as good on the cheque
[1:22:59] as his father's was he had anything that
[1:23:05] he wished the Bible said seek ye first
[1:23:11] the kingdom of God and it's
[1:23:13] righteousness and all of these other
[1:23:16] things will be given you said what
[1:23:19] brother books are done crying out and I
[1:23:21] don't cry out and ain't got it yet cuz
[1:23:24] you cried out and hope God ain't giving
[1:23:27] you the Holy Ghost when you crying out
[1:23:29] in hope boulder you come this is my day
[1:23:32] this is my hour I'm gonna get it
[1:23:36] don't make no appointments with nobody
[1:23:38] else but Jesus himself I don't care how
[1:23:41] long it take I don't care how long it
[1:23:44] takes I'm gonna get this Holy Ghost I
[1:23:46] don't necessarily have to speak in
[1:23:48] tongues I don't have to shout but when I
[1:23:51] get up off my knees I know I got it I
[1:23:57] know there's been a change is that all
[1:24:03] right what if you came in this room
[1:24:05] and I had a book of war bucket of water
[1:24:07] with me and I took that book
[1:24:10] water and threw it on you you would
[1:24:14] automatically know you've had a change
[1:24:21] and that's just in the natural you can't
[1:24:25] tell me if it a bucket of spiritual
[1:24:27] waters knock you come down on you there
[1:24:29] is no way
[1:24:30] you can walk away and not know there's a
[1:24:33] change beloved y'all mind if I get this
[1:24:46] one more scripture beloved believe not
[1:24:49] every spirit but try the spirits where
[1:24:53] they were of God because many false
[1:24:55] prophets are come out into the world
[1:24:58] hereby know ye the Spirit of God every
[1:25:02] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:25:04] has come in the flesh is of God and
[1:25:06] every spirit that confesses not that
[1:25:09] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
[1:25:11] not of God and this is the spirit of
[1:25:16] Antichrist we're about you have heard
[1:25:18] that it should come and even now already
[1:25:20] is in the world let me say like this you
[1:25:24] may not even believe what I'm preaching
[1:25:26] you may not even think that what I'm
[1:25:28] saying is necessary but I ask you a
[1:25:31] question since you have become a
[1:25:33] Christian how much of your life has
[1:25:35] changed how much do you love God is your
[1:25:41] daily prayer is to be better for God is
[1:25:43] to push into his his eternal our
[1:25:46] character hello what are you doing with
[1:25:51] the life that God has given you you say
[1:25:53] you got it and the Bible says you'll
[1:25:55] notice tree by the fruit it bear
[1:25:58] hallelujah how many signs have followed
[1:26:01] you the Bible says the Bible says Amen
[1:26:04] these signs have followed them they
[1:26:05] believe I mean what is your vindication
[1:26:10] because every piece of the bride will be
[1:26:13] vindicated you understand me and then
[1:26:17] you know whip pushing into the
[1:26:19] manifestation of the full adoption of
[1:26:22] Christ
[1:26:22] where are you in

[1:26:47] God will never force himself on you this
[1:26:52] is a love affair
[1:26:56] Jeremiah father McCall close with this
[1:27:00] Jeremiah 15 forgive me I'm crying out
[1:27:04] because God is crying out I don't know
[1:27:07] who he's all he's talking to he may be
[1:27:09] talking to some he may be talking to all
[1:27:11] you know I mean all I know is that God
[1:27:14] is trying to reach somebody's heart and
[1:27:17] and you're allowing the devil to harden
[1:27:19] your heart because you think you've got
[1:27:22] time you think because I'm young I need

[1:30:59] let me tell you something there is no
[1:31:00] fellowship in hell and a lot of us think
[1:31:05] because we're under this message praise
[1:31:08] God ain't going to hear we got us a
[1:31:11] prophet

[1:31:32] thank you for your patience I'm gonna be
[1:31:36] working on this until God tells me to
[1:31:38] stop those of you who have not heard the
[1:31:40] message that I preached on Wednesday

[1:31:44] then you'll be able to catch up to where
[1:31:46] we are I don't know like I said who God
[1:31:49] is talking to I believe he's talking to
[1:31:51] all of us from the pulpit to the door
[1:31:53] but if we want to see God in the way
[1:31:56] that Malachi 4 brought it we must live
[1:31:59] it and the only way we can live it is
[1:32:01] that Christ being you living it for this
[1:32:05] day so who shall have any pity upon thee
[1:32:10] O Jerusalem or who shall bemoaned be or
[1:32:15] who shall go aside to ask how thou doest
[1:32:19] thou has forsaken me said the lord thou
[1:32:24] art gone backwards therefore I will
[1:32:27] stretch out my hand against thee and
[1:32:31] destroy thee I am weary with repenting
[1:32:36] huh I am weary with repenting now you
[1:32:42] say what brother books we're the
[1:32:43] Bridewell
[1:32:44] guru Israel used to be the bride God
[1:32:47] called her a bride
[1:32:51] that can't happen to us well it will not
[1:32:54] do those who I licked it those who are
[1:32:57] chosen it will not but how
[1:33:01] No how do you know you've been chosen
[1:33:05] let's use Mary for an example we use her
[1:33:09] an example Mary came to know she was
[1:33:12] chosen because an angel came to her and
[1:33:15] said thou art favored and Mary you're
[1:33:21] going to produce a supernatural son
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:28] that's it that's how the angel come to
[1:33:32] us you will be impregnated by God
[1:33:38] himself and you were produced a
[1:33:41] supernatural son a son that will come
[1:33:45] forth from you not by sex but by God's
[1:33:50] choosing hello so therefore you saying
[1:33:56] what the Christ in us is the
[1:33:58] supernatural son and he will be
[1:34:03] manifested and you and I must understand
[1:34:10] that's how you know you Brian
[1:34:12] is when the word for this day is
[1:34:14] manifested in your life and I would not
[1:34:17] stop I would not stop calling on God
[1:34:21] until I see Jesus and Jesus only no
[1:34:26] longer me but him thou has forsaken me
[1:34:31] saith the Lord for thou art going
[1:34:34] backwards therefore will I stretch out
[1:34:37] my hand against thee and destroy thee I
[1:34:40] am weary with repenting
[1:34:42] I will fan them with a fan in the gates
[1:34:45] of the land I will be read them of
[1:34:48] children I will destroy my people since
[1:34:52] they returned not from their ways
[1:35:00] understand that this announcement went
[1:35:04] out to the whole of Israel and yet there
[1:35:09] was a few that this does not apply to
[1:35:13] that was Daniel there was Shadrach
[1:35:17] Meshach and Abednego if there were
[1:35:20] others I don't know but all I know is
[1:35:24] that when that king of Babylon came and
[1:35:27] y'all better understand me y'all don't
[1:35:30] even see where this whole thing is
[1:35:32] moving but I'm gonna tell you something
[1:35:33] this country and as well as the world
[1:35:36] it's really freeing to go up in a riot
[1:35:40] if you're not spiritual enough to see
[1:35:43] what this thing is mounting up to and
[1:35:44] let me tell you something you better
[1:35:47] have your goods Oh y'all think y'all you
[1:35:50] think you're not gonna be tested you
[1:35:53] think because somebody told a lie on you

[1:35:58] brothers sister says something bad to
[1:35:59] you and I'm totally upset you think
[1:36:03] that's all we got to deal with the
[1:36:06] squeeze is already on us the pressure in
[1:36:08] your mind to do right versus do wrong is
[1:36:12] on you every day annoying things out of
[1:36:16] hell and I know there's nobody in here
[1:36:22] that I could believe wants to go to hell
[1:36:24] how many y'all want to miss the rapture
[1:36:27] nobody wants to mr. rapture this is why
[1:36:30] we come yes it's the blood of Jesus yes
[1:36:34] he justifies us but you must bear him
[1:36:38] you must bring forth there's a balance
[1:36:41] to it God ain't gonna come in a
[1:36:44] nightclub and rap to you huh
[1:36:49] and guarding or you know God go catch
[1:36:52] you on your own your TV on yo yo yo yo

[1:37:06] the midst of a fight with your relative
[1:37:09] the rapture takes place and you get
[1:37:11] ready to
[1:37:11] somebody in God gonna rap to you it
[1:37:13] ain't happening y'all must realize that
[1:37:21] these things that Satan is putting on
[1:37:22] you is to keep you from a rapture it
[1:37:25] doesn't mean you're not saved but you
[1:37:28] and I have come to make a rapture we
[1:37:33] come to please him and I I say it like
[1:37:37] this I don't know what you're gonna do
[1:37:38] but I come to praise his name I come to
[1:37:42] make a rapture do you fight yes do you
[1:37:45] fall yes do you stumble yes but I don't
[1:37:49] give up there is no given up in me I
[1:37:55] don't give up I don't quit because times
[1:38:00] are tough let's stand now if you quit
[1:38:06] God's side what other side is there you
[1:38:12] got Satan now you saying I'm gonna leave
[1:38:15] God and go to Satan and guess what Satan
[1:38:20] only ask you to do anything he tells you
[1:38:23] God gives you your will Satan takes your
[1:38:27] will he makes you do things that you
[1:38:32] don't need a law to do hello y'all y'all
[1:38:37] act like y'all not human
[1:38:38] they ain't a person in here that can say
[1:38:41] that Satan has never made them do
[1:38:43] anything they did they won't they didn't
[1:38:45] want to do every one of us is guilty
[1:38:48] whether it be by way of a lie or some
[1:38:52] debt deception or or just looking at
[1:38:56] things that we shouldn't look we look in
[1:38:58] fashion I'm gonna tell you something
[1:39:00] about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:39:01] don't care about fashion it's alright to
[1:39:03] have nice things but God don't care and
[1:39:05] the Holy Ghost don't either
[1:39:07] that's why brother been said I don't
[1:39:08] even care my pants and my jacket match
[1:39:10] or not especially
[1:39:13] it wasn't on these things you know God
[1:39:16] allow us to have nice things but when we
[1:39:18] get to a place where you got to have
[1:39:20] this and you've got to have that your
[1:39:21] affection is not on things above
[1:39:24] you ain't gotta have nothing like he
[1:39:27] said those missionaries that that's
[1:39:29] living off a few pennies
[1:39:31] you know how they ever get much to eat
[1:39:33] but they're happy like they ride down
[1:39:35] the street in the limousine no I didn't
[1:39:44] come to make you shout or dance or
[1:39:46] rejoice I believe the message in which
[1:39:49] God is trying to give all over to us is
[1:39:51] a message that will break your heart God
[1:39:58] delights in a broken and contrite spirit
[1:40:02] but as being a servant of the Lord
[1:40:04] I see where some of y'all hearts are so
[1:40:08] hard you don't even know what it feels
[1:40:10] like to cry at it we have become so
[1:40:16] selfish when it comes to God we won't
[1:40:19] God to give us everything and all God
[1:40:22] asked us for such little such a little
[1:40:25] thing it's worshiping praise just being
[1:40:30] faithful to the Word of God you know but
[1:40:33] yet we want God to be so faithful and
[1:40:35] when God doesn't answer us according to
[1:40:38] the way we should we we get attitudes
[1:40:41] about it may God have mercy on us
[1:40:47] He blessed us with a job blesses up with
[1:40:52] money blesses us with house blesses us
[1:40:56] with food and we so forget how good we
[1:41:02] have it I can remember the time when I
[1:41:07] was a boy I only had one pair of shoes
[1:41:12] most of the time they had holes in the
[1:41:16] bottom didn't have a change of clothes
[1:41:21] except for in the weekend we go to
[1:41:24] church my mom washed out the best that
[1:41:27] we had so that we could go to church I
[1:41:30] could remember the time I would be so
[1:41:32] hungry I didn't know what to do I would
[1:41:34] go outside and just turn the faucet on
[1:41:36] it just feel my
[1:41:37] Bettye a belly up with water it would
[1:41:42] even hurt going down because my stomach
[1:41:43] would be so empty we forget we forget
[1:41:55] just how much he's done for us in such a
[1:41:57] short period of time God likes to be
[1:42:02] remembered like everybody when you give
[1:42:05] them a gift or do something special
[1:42:06] you'd like to be remembered that you did
[1:42:08] that it's just in us I don't know where
[1:42:13] your heart is but he knows so what we're
[1:42:18] gonna do we're just going to bow in a
[1:42:19] word of Prayer Oh Lord Jesus I'm sorry
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:31] forgive me Lord for prostituting your
[1:42:36] time cleanse me of all my
[1:42:40] unrighteousness Lord give me a clean
[1:42:44] heart father as we preached Lord I only
[1:42:52] you know you told you era Maya they
[1:42:56] wouldn't repent there was only a few in
[1:42:59] that group that had a contact with you
[1:43:02] Lord father help us Jesus because
[1:43:08] there's so many people around this
[1:43:10] message because that just believe and
[1:43:13] feel they're gonna make a raft because
[1:43:14] they only believe in you Malachi 4 Lord
[1:43:19] but Malachi 4 directed us to You Lord he
[1:43:24] pointed us to you and yet there's still
[1:43:28] so many who are staying with John
[1:43:30] instead of following Jesus God we need
[1:43:34] you we need your grace we need your
[1:43:38] mercy there's no words or any kind of
[1:43:41] clichéd that will be able to say to that
[1:43:44] gate thank you at the gate to get there
[1:43:46] to get in the only thing that he'll be
[1:43:49] looking for is that life that toe
[1:43:52] even as your prophet said that it is
[1:43:55] your life that character that we can
[1:43:57] take with us we can expect to go to
[1:44:01] heaven if we living like hell or living
[1:44:05] like we're living in here help us God
[1:44:09] overcome this age that we're living in
[1:44:12] where even though bride who's been
[1:44:14] called by this great message hallelujah

[1:44:20] seemed to be losing her fight help us

[1:44:50] opportunity to repent they would not God

[1:45:13] trying to protect them from hurt harm in
[1:45:16] danger parents Lord who seem to be
[1:45:20] losing it Lord yes Lord instead of
[1:45:23] praying with their children and trying
[1:45:25] to get them to the Holy Ghost Lord our
[1:45:27] words are not effective without God help
[1:45:30] us Jesus we can't add one cubit to our
[1:45:35] statue and that definitely not to our
[1:45:37] children Lord I pray father God that you
[1:45:41] will help us understand this is a
[1:45:43] spiritual warfare and the only way that
