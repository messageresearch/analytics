[34:24] those are mean no harm but just trying
[34:27] to do a thorough job amen as we stand
[34:30] let us go to Joshua the 24th I had such
[34:33] a good time on Saturday and Sunday and I
[34:38] was just so inspired and I'm still
[34:39] inspired by the word of God
[34:42] um knowing that uh we are free to
[34:46] worship God in that way it's it's just a
[34:49] sad note that God had to come by to
[34:52] remind us that we have that freedom but
[34:56] I thank God for his grace and his Mercy
[34:59] uh because he did yes and so I don't
[35:03] want it to be you know in a sense of
[35:08] well we've got to be systematic but I
[35:10] want everybody to have that Liberty that
[35:13] when the Holy Spirit comes uh you can
[35:16] dance you can shout whatever you need to
[35:19] do you know they We Know by the grace of
[35:21] God that the holy spirit will not
[35:22] interrupt the word amen you know unless
[35:25] it's a Hallelujah you know something
[35:27] like that but that's an amen you know
[35:29] what I mean that's a sickle that's a
[35:31] sickle yes but I mean you know you
[35:33] understand what I'm saying I think all
[35:35] of us are mature enough to understand
[35:37] Joshua 24
[35:39] 13-16 and I love the pulls of God I
[35:43] appreciate everybody who participated uh
[35:47] in preaching
[35:48] because Jesse wasn't preaching by
[35:50] himself amen he really uh had a great
[35:54] time he was blessed and so I believe all
[35:56] the people were too and uh just thank
[35:59] God for our brother Luna bringing his
[36:01] church by it was a real family reunion
[36:04] we love that
[36:07] Joshua 24 13-16
[36:11] and I have given you a land for which ye
[36:14] did not labor
[36:16] and cities
[36:18] which he built not
[36:21] he dwelt in them
[36:23] of The Vineyards and the olive yards
[36:26] which you planted not do ye eat amen now
[36:30] therefore fear the lord
[36:32] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[36:37] and put away the gods with your father
[36:39] served on the other side of the flood
[36:42] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord amen
[36:47] and if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[36:51] the Lord
[36:52] choose you this day whom ye will serve
[36:56] amen whether the god which your father
[36:58] served that were on the other side of
[37:00] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[37:04] whose land you dwell but as for me in my
[37:08] house we will serve the Lord amen and
[37:12] the people answered and said God forbid
[37:16] that we should forsake the Lord to serve
[37:19] other gods
[37:21] one more scripture I believe let us go
[37:24] to Exodus the 12th chapter
[37:28] beginning at the seventh verse we'll
[37:30] read down to the 14th verse of this
[37:33] scripture
[37:37] if you're there we'll read Exodus 12
[37:41] 7-14 and they shall take of the blood
[37:46] and strike it on two side posts and on
[37:50] the upper door post of the houses
[37:52] wherein they shall eat it
[37:55] and they shall eat the Flesh in the
[37:58] night roast with fire and unleavened
[38:02] bread and with bitter herbs they shall
[38:04] eat it
[38:05] eat not of it raw nor sudden at all with
[38:10] water but roast with fire
[38:13] his head with his legs and with the
[38:16] pertinence thereof
[38:18] and ye shall let nothing of it remain
[38:21] until the morning
[38:23] and that which remaineth of it until the
[38:26] morning ye shall burn with fire
[38:29] and thus shall ye eat it with your loins
[38:32] girded your shoes on your feet and your
[38:36] staff in your hand
[38:38] and ye shall eat it in haste it is the
[38:42] Lord's Passover
[38:44] for I will pass through the land of
[38:46] Egypt this night and will Smite all the
[38:50] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[38:54] and Beast and against all the gods of
[38:57] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[39:00] Lord and the blood shall be to you for
[39:04] token
[39:05] upon the houses where you are and when I
[39:08] see the blood
[39:10] I will pass over you and the plague
[39:13] shall not be unto you to destroy you
[39:16] when I smite the land of Egypt and this
[39:20] day shall be unto you for a memorial
[39:24] you shall keep it a feast to the Lord
[39:27] throughout your generation you shall

[39:53] hearers of the word but receiveth of the
[39:55] word therefore doers of the word amen

[40:06] you need for white can I have a water
[40:09] please
[40:12] we out of it okay that's fine God is so
[40:15] good to us amen
[40:18] I like to uh entitle this message
[40:21] choose ye this day
[40:25] we are at a time when
[40:27] everything seems well
[40:30] but it is not
[40:32] we must understand by the grace of God
[40:34] that we must keep focused
[40:36] amen we realize by the grace of God that
[40:40] we have the greatest message amen that
[40:42] have ever struck the Earth
[40:44] this message could not have been
[40:46] preached in Luther's day it could not
[40:48] have been preached in Wesley's day it
[40:51] only could have been preached in this
[40:52] day amen and remember now if God has a
[40:57] message there must be a people to
[40:59] receive the message
[41:00] and we must understand that God has
[41:03] chosen us amen amen thank you brother
[41:06] two eggs to to be Witnesses
[41:10] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[41:13] and forever and that he is alive and
[41:17] well when we hear the word of God and
[41:21] have heard the word of God
[41:23] we know that by the grace of God that we
[41:26] can we must allow allow ourselves to be
[41:31] aligned up with the word
[41:34] Amen in other words
[41:35] amen we we we have no choosing amen oh
[41:39] whether we
[41:41] can take part of it and leave the other
[41:44] part
[41:45] but we understand according to the
[41:47] scripture we must eat it all
[41:50] we must eat all the pleasant parts
[41:54] and we almost we all all so we should
[41:58] all also eat the unpleasant part he says
[42:03] not only does do we eat the legs and all
[42:05] of these things but we must eat the
[42:07] bitter part
[42:08] that part that most people would frown
[42:11] that
[42:12] and you know the word of God said you
[42:14] know in preparing this uh uh uh lamb
[42:19] we're going to this lamb must be roasted
[42:22] yeah it cannot be boiled or baked
[42:27] it has to be roasted with fire
[42:31] and we understand that the fire always
[42:33] represents the Holy Ghost
[42:36] amen amen what we know by God's grace
[42:40] that God in every generation gives man a
[42:45] choice amen life
[42:47] or death
[42:49] and we know just even as Joshua said
[42:52] choose you this day amen who are you
[42:56] going to serve
[42:57] and if there be a generation that has to
[43:01] deal with idols
[43:03] this is the generation
[43:05] this generation man has a man has
[43:10] excluded God yes and they're trying
[43:13] their best to wipe him completely out
[43:15] amen where he gets no credit no honor
[43:21] but we find out that men wants to be
[43:24] worshiped and they want you to worship
[43:27] them of course most men amen of the
[43:31] world think that God doesn't exist
[43:34] but we who have been chosen by God Amen
[43:38] we don't we know that he exists and we
[43:40] not only know that but we know that God
[43:43] is God
[43:45] when we talk about choosing and I'm not
[43:48] going to be alone tonight
[43:49] but when we talk about choosing
[43:52] it's right and wrong
[43:55] right from wrong
[43:57] and we realize in this day right is
[44:00] being called wrong that's right and
[44:03] wrong is becoming right
[44:05] but this is why we need the Bible yes
[44:08] and the Bible is our absolute amen it is
[44:12] the thing that guides us it is the thing
[44:15] that teaches us amen it is the thing
[44:18] that identify us
[44:20] whether we be of God or whether we be of
[44:24] the devil is that right
[44:26] so the word of God says you've got to
[44:28] choose life or death
[44:30] now the thing that gets me is that in
[44:33] the time of The Exodus it was an urgent
[44:37] Time a time of urgency but I find out
[44:40] that in this day even within the church
[44:43] World they have no urgency and the
[44:47] reason being is because God said it in
[44:52] the last days people will be lovers of
[44:55] pleasure more than lovers of God Amen
[44:58] there'll be truth Breakers they'll be
[45:01] backed by us they'll be uh Covenant
[45:04] Breakers however you want to put it but
[45:06] they will indulge themselves in the
[45:09] things of darkness and the Bible said it
[45:12] would be so bad that me and rather have
[45:15] Darkness tonight and the reason why they
[45:18] choose Darkness rather than light is
[45:21] because if they choose light their deeds
[45:23] will be made manifest so we're living in
[45:26] a world that we don't care how Wicked
[45:30] the politicians become because we enjoy
[45:33] that because we want to be as wicked as
[45:37] they are but there was a time
[45:40] when the country was was ran uh by the
[45:44] Bible principles and during those times
[45:47] we had less crimes less murders less of
[45:51] everything that Satan can offer but
[45:55] what's the country now the country has
[45:58] become almost Lawless is that right
[46:01] we're living in a time where men must
[46:04] make a choice will you choose life or
[46:08] will you choose death and there is only
[46:11] one knife and that life is the life that
[46:14] Jesus Christ gives you is that right
[46:17] Buddha can't give you life Allah can't
[46:20] give you light only Jesus Christ can
[46:23] give you life how come he said I am the
[46:27] light I am the truth and I am the way
[46:31] Hallelujah and we realize tonight that
[46:35] our God is not dead he may be dead to
[46:38] the well but not to the True Believer
[46:41] Hallelujah and you say brother Brooks
[46:44] how do you know that he's alive I know
[46:47] he's alive because he's living in me
[46:50] Hallelujah you say how do you know he's
[46:53] living in me because he's been my healer
[46:56] he's just he's Batavia he's been my
[46:59] deliverer he talks with me he walks with
[47:03] me and he tells me that I am his own
[47:07] Who We Are yes sir
[47:09] people look at Christians
[47:11] as though their pushovers
[47:14] but a real Christian man
[47:16] a real Christian man is a real man
[47:19] and a real Christian woman is a real
[47:22] woman
[47:23] why because we choose life
[47:25] Hallelujah now here's a quote your
[47:29] Eternal Destiny is a choice
[47:32] that's choosing a LeBron
[47:34] and maybe tonight some of you will make
[47:37] that choice of where you spend eternity
[47:42] before this service end tonight so I
[47:44] want you to say this to those who who
[47:46] may be listening it's a choice
[47:50] and that's what people don't understand
[47:52] God always gives a man a choice
[47:56] hallelujah amen there's too many
[47:59] witnesses for God is that right even if
[48:04] it's not the human man even if it's not
[48:07] the man the Bible says Heaven and Earth
[48:10] declare of my glory amen how can anybody
[48:13] believe that there is no God when they
[48:17] themselves have no rule over their lives
[48:20] is that right oh you said what do you
[48:22] mean brother Brooks when a man gets sick
[48:26] does he invite sickness when a man got
[48:30] cancer does he invite cancer and when
[48:33] did when cancer come can a man get rid
[48:35] of it well if he was a God if he was so
[48:39] Supreme he would be able to get rid of
[48:41] it first of all he'd be able to stop him
[48:44] from coming
[48:45] Hallelujah but every man that is born of
[48:49] a woman has been appointed to die why
[48:53] because God said so amen there is a
[48:56] higher ruler and that ruler is life
[49:01] listen let me move on
[49:03] he said the Eternal Destiny is a choice
[49:05] and maybe tonight some of you will make
[49:08] that charge whether you spend eternity
[49:11] before this service in tonight there'll
[49:14] be one time that if you turn God down
[49:17] many times
[49:20] there'll be one time you'll turn him
[49:23] down for the last time you see and
[49:25] that's what people don't understand
[49:27] there's a lot of Christians
[49:30] quote Christians that have turned him
[49:32] down too many times
[49:35] Hallelujah they're dead and don't even
[49:38] know they're dead
[49:40] Hallelujah is that right there's a time
[49:43] you say oh that can't be true it is true
[49:47] amen Hallelujah and when you say well
[49:50] what do you mean brother Brooks I'm
[49:52] getting ready to say something that a
[49:53] lot of people don't understand may not
[49:55] understand
[49:56] we say oh we got a covenant
[49:59] but your Covenant means nothing
[50:02] if you don't have the token
[50:05] hallelujah oh I I've got I'm Abraham
[50:08] seed I got an unconditional Covenant
[50:10] not if you don't have the token yeah man
[50:14] amen I got the prophet's word because
[50:17] the the token is above the Covenant
[50:21] and that's what people don't understand
[50:22] oh I can live the way I want to because
[50:25] I've got a promise yes
[50:27] but if you got a promise that promise
[50:30] must be fulfilled in your life
[50:35] do it but you gotta have faith
[50:39] Hallelujah
[50:40] yes sir see what people don't understand
[50:44] you turn God down too many times and how
[50:48] often do we preach I think about the
[50:51] competition that goes along goes on even
[50:53] in this little church among the people
[50:56] you know what I'm saying I got a house
[50:58] you got a house All God's Children got a
[51:02] house no
[51:03] foreign
[51:04] but you see what people do they compete
[51:08] if I got a house I got to get you got to
[51:11] get them oh the other person got to get
[51:12] a bigger house
[51:14] or a better car it is crazy and then
[51:18] they'll spend all their time and then
[51:21] trying to make is meet
[51:23] all they had to do is trust God
[51:27] Hallelujah because the Bible said if you
[51:30] pay your tithes and off and God will
[51:32] pull you out of blessing you won't have
[51:35] a room to receive I believe that
[51:39] he said what do you what do you mean
[51:40] Brother Bruce look at me
[51:43] I'm an example of what God can do for
[51:46] you
[51:47] there are others here who are examples
[51:50] what God has done for them it wasn't
[51:53] their intellect it was the blessings of
[51:57] God the mercies of God the grace of God
[52:00] because they stayed with the word
[52:04] even in times of testing
[52:07] they gained God and made him first
[52:10] Hallelujah
[52:13] Hallelujah see there is a line between
[52:16] mercy and judgment
[52:19] and it's a dangerous thing for a man or
[52:21] woman boy or girl
[52:25] I shouldn't say it but I'm gonna say it
[52:27] anyway do you know how much tithing it
[52:29] was this last weekend
[52:31] two hundred dollars
[52:33] same
[52:35] on this church shame on the people who
[52:38] were dancing and shouting listen all of
[52:43] that won't get you to heaven obedience
[52:47] thank God I'm I'm not destitute
[52:52] ah Lord I Thank God God always picks me
[52:56] up that I don't have to depend on nobody
[52:59] but him
[53:02] but it's a shame
[53:10] I'm glad so many I'm gonna tell it
[53:12] anyhow because you got to get it out to
[53:14] have a pure heart right
[53:17] had one brother who actually paid for a
[53:19] couple of rooms for me
[53:21] when I went on my vacation
[53:23] after that I had a collection of 300 and
[53:26] something dollars
[53:27] that's it
[53:28] I'm so glad people love me I'm so glad
[53:31] they care for me but it's outright shame
[53:39] you say well what do you mean you don't
[53:41] know the I don't ask anybody for
[53:43] anything
[53:45] it wasn't even my desire to do so
[53:47] someone else thought to say that
[53:51] and out there was said and done I wish
[53:53] we hadn't even come to the church for it
[53:55] because I don't want nobody to think I'm
[53:58] begging for anything
[54:02] it's a dangerous thing for a man or
[54:04] woman boy or girl to step across a line
[54:07] for there is no return when you step
[54:10] across that deadline
[54:13] so tonight it might be the time that
[54:16] many would take their decision where
[54:19] they would spend in this eternity you
[54:22] understand what I'm saying this church
[54:25] and I'm sure it's everywhere else need
[54:28] to repent
[54:30] literally
[54:32] breaking down and crying out for the
[54:34] help and grace of God
[54:38] amen amen and you say you got the token
[54:42] you say you got the toe cut
[54:45] it's more than just knowing God sent a
[54:48] prophet amen amen it's more than reading
[54:51] the books and listening to the tapes it
[54:54] is the literal life of Jesus Christ
[54:56] Living in you
[54:58] choose you this day I wish more people
[55:01] were here
[55:08] it's amazing
[55:12] if we could just only have a heart like
[55:14] David
[55:16] David looked at that that saw God didn't
[55:19] have a real house
[55:21] and David desire was to put everything
[55:22] he had into it
[55:24] even though David had made mistakes he
[55:27] wanted to build God a house
[55:31] and God turned them down
[55:35] but David didn't stop serving God no
[55:38] no God chasing David because of his evil
[55:42] Deeds
[55:43] but David still love God Amen
[55:46] Hallelujah
[55:49] and at the end of the end of the role
[55:51] because David was a man after God's Own
[55:54] Heart
[55:55] see what I'm saying without the word
[55:57] we'll make it
[55:59] David saw the art coming back to the
[56:02] camp like the brother said last week he
[56:05] began to dance and shout and praise God
[56:07] why he knew that God was returning
[56:11] and this message indicate that God has
[56:14] returned amen but where is the dancing
[56:16] where is the shouting where is the
[56:19] loyalty to God not to a man loyalty to
[56:23] God Amen
[56:25] [Music]
[56:27] Hallelujah
[56:33] God be merciful
[56:36] I'm not going to be long tonight
[56:39] but we need the Naked Truth
[56:41] people just don't know that their souls
[56:44] are in danger
[56:45] they think because we follow Malachi for
[56:48] did not God God told Israel they were
[56:50] going to have a prophet
[56:52] did he not come he came guess what they
[56:57] despise Moses the majority of the people
[57:00] repelled against him that's what I find
[57:03] out in this church remember the majority
[57:05] of the people Rebels against the word
[57:08] and it ain't a personal thing it's just
[57:12] what people do
[57:13] what was yesterday is today
[57:16] and Solomon said there's no new thing
[57:18] under the sun
[57:23] we've got to wake up
[57:25] it is so late
[57:29] I was talking to somebody the other my
[57:30] son today he said it's real late Daddy I
[57:32] said no I know it is yes but the people
[57:36] eyes are blind they're trying to
[57:38] establish something here this is not our
[57:42] home it's not it's all right to have
[57:45] nice stuff but keep your eyes on Jesus
[57:49] keep your eyes on the word amen
[57:52] hallelujah that's the most important
[57:55] thing
[57:56] what are you going to say to God when he
[57:58] asks you the question why you didn't
[58:00] make it to church oh Lord I had an
[58:03] attitude with the preacher that's not
[58:05] good enough
[58:07] you don't come to see me anyway you come
[58:10] to see Jesus Christ
[58:12] Hallelujah that's a baby in the gospel a
[58:16] baby you're pouting you're angry you are
[58:20] frustrated because you can't get your
[58:22] way here I wish I could give you a
[58:25] pacifier
[58:26] it makes no sense
[58:29] here we had a time we supposed to be
[58:31] maturing and people are playing around
[58:33] like children that's what the Bible said
[58:36] that the children of Israel did in the
[58:38] wilderness after hearing the word they
[58:41] rolled up to play
[58:43] this is not a playing time this is a
[58:46] time of sincerity giving God all you
[58:49] have amen amen yes it is oppressed
[58:53] everybody in here know you got to press
[58:55] every hey you got to pray press to pray
[58:59] amen amen you got to press to read
[59:02] amen hallelujah you got to press
[59:03] sometime to get out on your knees
[59:05] Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about
[59:08] but I refuse to let the elements of this
[59:11] world stop me from serving my God Amen
[59:18] thank you Lord you got to know who you
[59:21] are
[59:23] when you believe this message you can't
[59:24] believe it halfway have one foot in the
[59:28] world and one foot in the message it
[59:29] ain't gonna work
[59:33] yeah but I find out that's what people
[59:35] do that's what they're doing Hebrews 12.
[59:39] 23-27.
[59:42] The Naked Truth
[59:44] people think hey oh I love God you are a
[59:47] liar
[59:48] the Bible said if you love me you'll
[59:50] keep my Commandments don't tell me you
[59:53] know God don't even believe you love him
[59:55] I don't believe you love it
[59:58] and the prophet God said this he said A
[1:00:00] True Believer Holy Ghost believer when
[1:00:03] that those doors are open they're there
[1:00:08] yeah
[1:00:10] open tonight why they don't care if
[1:00:12] there's two or three they're there
[1:00:16] amen hallelujah that's the beauty of it
[1:00:19] we've got something
[1:00:21] nobody can tell us we don't have
[1:00:25] what I've got a pool in me something
[1:00:28] pulls me something holds me
[1:00:33] and I know that who would I know who it
[1:00:36] is you know but the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:40] don't get me wrong I enjoyed all that
[1:00:42] dancing and shouting I don't mind doing
[1:00:43] it today tonight if you want to
[1:00:47] but my point is this when all that's
[1:00:50] said and done look look look
[1:00:53] where's the results of all of that
[1:01:01] all up in the front right I'm not
[1:01:04] talking to ones who who have a good time
[1:01:06] we had a good time
[1:01:07] I'm just saying I thank God for the
[1:01:10] faithful you you you can do what you you
[1:01:12] know and that's the thing what's what's
[1:01:15] this is not a time for play
[1:01:18] Amen to the general assembly the third
[1:01:21] 23rd verse of the 12th chapter
[1:01:24] to the general assembly and Church of
[1:01:28] the firstborn which are written in
[1:01:30] heaven and to God the judge of all
[1:01:34] and to the spirits of just men made
[1:01:37] perfect
[1:01:39] right amen those who are Justified
[1:01:43] you you you say well what do you mean
[1:01:44] brother I'm saying they're God there
[1:01:47] must be a relationship
[1:01:50] he said oh I'm Justified but let me tell
[1:01:52] you something the justification that
[1:01:55] they had in Luther's day was such a
[1:01:58] justification many of them die
[1:02:02] just under that that anointing to know
[1:02:05] that they have truly been Justified
[1:02:08] and when you know that your sin has been
[1:02:10] forgiven and that you're truly been
[1:02:12] Justified you do everything you can to
[1:02:16] keep from sinning against God Amen amen
[1:02:18] hallelujah amen but we find out that we
[1:02:22] got people who's got the devil for the
[1:02:24] buddy for a buddy
[1:02:27] that's what it is
[1:02:31] don't even know it
[1:02:33] and anytime you come to the word the
[1:02:36] church and I see people coming here and
[1:02:38] they think I don't see that thing that
[1:02:41] they carry in with them they carry it in
[1:02:44] and they leave out with it
[1:02:47] Secrets hidden sin
[1:02:50] and they think God don't let me see it
[1:02:54] I may not know exactly what it is but I
[1:02:57] know when I see the glory of God and
[1:02:59] when I don't amen
[1:03:03] Hallelujah
[1:03:05] even back in those old Pentecostal
[1:03:08] Church the people used to come to church
[1:03:10] with a light
[1:03:12] shining glowing all over them
[1:03:17] now you see those dull dark Spirits
[1:03:21] hanging all on people amen and even
[1:03:23] brother Bradham says in the invasion of
[1:03:25] the United States He said Christians
[1:03:28] will be packing demons
[1:03:32] is here
[1:03:33] it's now amen it's wicked stuff going on
[1:03:38] very Wicked
[1:03:42] Lord he was I believe it was the Lord
[1:03:44] that spoke to me and said even among the
[1:03:47] people you have incense
[1:03:52] now how are you going to confess that
[1:03:58] sad is sad
[1:04:03] and I believe that was the Lord and just
[1:04:06] as sure if the people don't make it
[1:04:07] right the Holy Ghost is going to expose
[1:04:10] it
[1:04:12] my amen
[1:04:18] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[1:04:21] Covenant
[1:04:22] into the blood of sprinkling that
[1:04:25] speaking better things than that of Abel
[1:04:29] see that you refuse not him that's
[1:04:32] speaking
[1:04:33] for if they escape not who uh not who
[1:04:36] refuse him
[1:04:38] if they escape not who refuse him that
[1:04:41] spank on Earth much more shall not
[1:04:44] re-escape if we turn away from him that
[1:04:49] speaketh from heaven you understand what
[1:04:52] he's saying because Abel even though he
[1:04:56] was saved had a spirit of Vengeance
[1:05:01] he cried for blood
[1:05:04] but here was Jesus
[1:05:06] father forgive them
[1:05:09] for they know not what they do is that
[1:05:12] God yes you say well what do you mean
[1:05:14] look at Stephen with the same anointing
[1:05:17] that Jesus had when he was being stoned
[1:05:21] he said father all these things not to
[1:05:24] their charge
[1:05:25] that is the token that is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:29] if Jesus said it then he says it now
[1:05:33] when someone trespasses you when someone
[1:05:36] goes against you when you have an altar
[1:05:38] whatever the case of it being you always
[1:05:40] come back to the Lord forgive them for
[1:05:43] they know not what they do amen you
[1:05:46] don't say oh you reap what you sow
[1:05:50] that's not God's anointing
[1:05:54] that's the anointing of Abel
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:57] but Jesus speaks up better
[1:06:00] Jesus speaks better things than hey
[1:06:04] he speaks love and forgiveness
[1:06:06] Hallelujah now you say what do you mean
[1:06:09] brother because that's why God put you
[1:06:10] in the most evil age there is he put you
[1:06:13] in his age because he knew there was
[1:06:16] going to be a lot of trespasses he knew
[1:06:19] that there was going to be a lot of
[1:06:20] people that come your way that you came
[1:06:22] in Holly
[1:06:24] in your natural stand
[1:06:26] but he knew
[1:06:28] that if you he knows that if you're a
[1:06:30] true seed when these days come you know
[1:06:33] where to get your strength from
[1:06:36] is that right
[1:06:37] you think about
[1:06:43] think about him call him a dog
[1:06:47] Hallelujah he didn't say kill him
[1:06:51] he said forgive him let him go
[1:06:55] see that's what we don't understand that
[1:06:58] that God this is our testing ground this
[1:07:01] is the broad testing ground if you got
[1:07:04] the token you act like Jesus amen he's
[1:07:08] the same yesterday to Dance Forever
[1:07:11] he doesn't change
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:14] whose voice then shook the Earth listen
[1:07:16] let me tell y'all something even if you
[1:07:18] haven't matured to that position you
[1:07:20] need to seek God as his Lord help me
[1:07:22] that's what he's here for he's the
[1:07:25] shepherd we're the Sheep
[1:07:27] Hallelujah whose voice then shook the
[1:07:30] Earth but now he have promised saying
[1:07:33] yet once more I shake not the Earth only
[1:07:36] but also heaven
[1:07:38] and this word yet once more signify the
[1:07:43] removing of those things that are shaken
[1:07:46] as of things that are made that those
[1:07:48] things which cannot be shaken May remain
[1:07:52] do y'all understand what he's saying
[1:07:54] he's basically saying there is a group
[1:07:56] of people that cannot be shaken
[1:08:00] there's a group of people that will
[1:08:02] remain no matter what God's what goes
[1:08:06] they will remain because God has sealed
[1:08:10] them with the token amen he has made a
[1:08:13] covenant with them
[1:08:16] Hallelujah he says okay now
[1:08:20] what what day is this
[1:08:22] before The Exodus what were they doing
[1:08:24] before The Exodus they were feasting on
[1:08:27] the lamb
[1:08:29] they were having a a feast I don't think
[1:08:32] they were sad
[1:08:34] when you eat it it brings a joy it
[1:08:37] brings out especially if it win is
[1:08:38] really good
[1:08:39] and I believe God made that lamb better
[1:08:42] than ever it didn't make any difference
[1:08:44] who prepared it
[1:08:46] man that was good lamb because it typed
[1:08:49] out Jesus himself
[1:08:51] Hallelujah but it wasn't that it wasn't
[1:08:53] the lamb that saved them
[1:08:56] it was the blood of the Lamb amen
[1:09:00] it was the blood of the Lamb because
[1:09:03] when the death angel was to passed he
[1:09:05] didn't say when I see the lamb he said
[1:09:07] but when I see the blood of the Lamb
[1:09:10] when I see it posted on your door posted
[1:09:13] a little I'll pass over you this is why
[1:09:16] so many Christians are in the church
[1:09:19] dying because they don't have the love
[1:09:22] or the blood of pride
[1:09:25] oh you got to have the Holy Ghost this
[1:09:26] day you don't have an awesome option
[1:09:29] oh God ain't working with no church
[1:09:31] membership no he don't care who your
[1:09:33] daddy your mama is
[1:09:35] no no no your daddy could be the
[1:09:37] preacher but every man got to be born
[1:09:39] again
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:41] what did the lamb do for you
[1:09:44] that's the question
[1:09:45] no the question is listen what did he do
[1:09:48] for you mate listen you and I we we
[1:09:51] don't know how blessed we are like I
[1:09:53] said the other day the word the the
[1:09:55] trouble Great Tribulation
[1:09:58] will come to those who will will be the
[1:10:01] worst
[1:10:03] ever for those who in this message who
[1:10:05] misses it
[1:10:07] y'all understand me why no because we
[1:10:09] know
[1:10:10] and to whom much is given much is
[1:10:13] required
[1:10:17] he said Brothers you shouldn't be
[1:10:19] critical I can't help it
[1:10:21] lives are at stake and if people don't
[1:10:25] wake up the same voice they hear tonight
[1:10:28] not only my voice William random and all
[1:10:31] of the others they're going to hear
[1:10:34] again amen
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] oh they look at me like
[1:10:41] I said oh Lord I don't have to worry
[1:10:44] about how the preachers of old felt
[1:10:47] you know Hallelujah I'm walking right in
[1:10:51] their shoes yeah
[1:10:52] people don't change
[1:10:56] they just as evil as they ever been
[1:10:58] right without God we can't change
[1:11:03] but it's because we lack Revelations
[1:11:07] and the revelation of the word brings us
[1:11:09] to understand who we really are
[1:11:12] Calvary what
[1:11:14] what did it mean to you
[1:11:17] he means my everything he is my
[1:11:20] everything and every listen how many of
[1:11:24] y'all can go through a day without
[1:11:25] saying Lord forgive me
[1:11:27] every day throughout the day Lord
[1:11:30] forgive me Father forgive me I'm saying
[1:11:34] this all the time
[1:11:36] amen every time my foot slip a little
[1:11:38] bit left or right I'm saying God forgive
[1:11:41] me what
[1:11:42] to go wrong
[1:11:50] go wrong Calvary he brought my shame
[1:11:54] do you know what it means we mean that
[1:11:56] that means that literally without
[1:11:58] Calvary you're naked
[1:12:00] do you understand without Calvary you
[1:12:02] wouldn't have a theophany body to go to
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:06] you wouldn't have a place of staying
[1:12:08] you know the uh Jesus said
[1:12:13] in My Father's House of many mentions
[1:12:16] if it wasn't so I wouldn't have told you
[1:12:20] but he could say that because he was the
[1:12:23] one who purchased you amen he's not
[1:12:26] talking about houses with big fences and
[1:12:30] all that he's talking about your body
[1:12:32] amen your house this is the original
[1:12:36] house there was no buildings built when
[1:12:39] Adam and Eve was on Earth they were the
[1:12:42] housing of God themselves
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:46] back to
[1:12:47] Hallelujah there may be other buildings
[1:12:50] and things according to the prophet's
[1:12:51] Vision yes but that's not what he's
[1:12:54] purchased he could give you that here
[1:12:58] it was you to the Redemption of your
[1:13:03] body he paid the price
[1:13:07] like I was telling somebody the other
[1:13:09] day and they may have disagreed with me
[1:13:11] people in their traditions and all these
[1:13:13] kind of stuff got everybody in such a
[1:13:15] bondage
[1:13:18] I get in trouble for this
[1:13:20] because people want to pay for their
[1:13:21] bride
[1:13:23] well that was Shadows that was tights
[1:13:26] that's things they did in the New
[1:13:28] Testament you don't find that
[1:13:30] no you know why because Jesus Paid the
[1:13:33] price that's right he bought his pride
[1:13:35] he paid for his bride y'all hear what
[1:13:38] I'm saying it's finished Paul never
[1:13:41] brought that up again because Jesus kept
[1:13:44] it all
[1:13:47] of them good people in bondage and as
[1:13:50] soon as they tried to move away from
[1:13:51] that you call it sin show me in the
[1:13:55] words
[1:13:57] not there
[1:13:58] it's a man-made tradition dogmas just
[1:14:01] like the Catholic church and it's so sad
[1:14:04] because people in this message got more
[1:14:06] Dormers and Creeds and everything just
[1:14:08] like the Catholic Church
[1:14:12] I get in trouble I do with people but do
[1:14:16] I care no I'm trying to Free People
[1:14:21] but some people like it you know
[1:14:24] and they like paying all that money out
[1:14:26] like that and compete we got the best
[1:14:28] way
[1:14:29] who can do the best dance
[1:14:33] it's nonsense has nothing to do with
[1:14:37] heaven I am
[1:14:40] hey you better start while you're here
[1:14:42] brother
[1:14:47] Mike my question is it's the naked truth
[1:14:50] I can tell you that amen Cal report my
[1:14:54] shame my nakedness
[1:14:56] don't put me in the Old Testament when
[1:14:57] I'm in the new amen
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:03] who will follow this Jesus what a shame
[1:15:07] it's true
[1:15:10] but I take Jesus for mine
[1:15:14] right
[1:15:15] amen you say what do you mean you got to
[1:15:17] choose your leader there are those who's
[1:15:20] choosing Satan
[1:15:21] and there are those whose choosing Jesus
[1:15:24] Christ amen
[1:15:27] amen there are those who are choosing
[1:15:30] Barabbas
[1:15:31] and there are those who are choosing
[1:15:33] Jesus Christ
[1:15:40] I love to see a man work hard to pick to
[1:15:43] pay for me
[1:15:45] if by you now you his horse
[1:15:52] you his property
[1:15:54] and that's the way they treat you
[1:15:58] and the Bible says against the word
[1:16:00] people love your wives as Christ loved
[1:16:04] the church
[1:16:09] oh Lord
[1:16:11] but it's true anyhow amen
[1:16:16] he whom the son is set free is free
[1:16:19] indeed amen I'm free
[1:16:24] amen you must choose your leader
[1:16:27] to become the word is our ambition you
[1:16:31] understand me I'm not to be a king not
[1:16:34] to be a not to be a policeman or or a
[1:16:37] doctor or a lawyer all those things are
[1:16:39] good but my ambition in this world is to
[1:16:42] be the word amen to reflect the words
[1:16:45] just to let the world see that Jesus is
[1:16:48] Alive amen oh I wish I could do it but I
[1:16:52] can't do it I'm waiting on him but he
[1:16:55] said if I believe it he'll bring it to
[1:16:57] pass amen amen and I believe that amen
[1:17:00] I've seen Miracles just recently I've
[1:17:02] seen God heal people deliver people and
[1:17:04] everything else in the last few months
[1:17:06] and stuff why because God is moving amen
[1:17:09] and some people he's not moving because
[1:17:11] they don't even really believe yeah but
[1:17:14] when you really believe amen something
[1:17:17] has to happen
[1:17:20] Hallelujah
[1:17:22] you choose your leader
[1:17:24] I don't care you say well what are you
[1:17:26] saying brother because I have to believe
[1:17:28] I've got children who don't believe but
[1:17:30] I believe I'm putting a token on them
[1:17:33] I'm taking what I got and claiming them
[1:17:37] I must believe
[1:17:40] amen
[1:17:42] yes Hallelujah yes yes today do things I
[1:17:46] don't like every day
[1:17:50] but I love my children I love my
[1:17:54] children unconditional ain't nobody
[1:17:55] going to stop me from loving my kids but
[1:17:57] children I say my Lambs they act like
[1:17:59] kids right now but my lamb
[1:18:05] oh Lord have mercy is that right what
[1:18:08] you going to do father Pharaoh or Moses
[1:18:12] come on Amen Jesus of Barabbas
[1:18:17] choose you this day amen
[1:18:20] hear though this is just show you how
[1:18:22] messed up the mind of the church was
[1:18:24] they saw the Miracles they saw dead Rays
[1:18:27] they saw the blind open they saw all
[1:18:29] these things they glorified Jesus when
[1:18:31] he was doing all those things but when
[1:18:33] he began to bring the word
[1:18:35] foreign
[1:18:37] that's how it is when you start bringing
[1:18:40] the word people don't like the word
[1:18:42] demons don't like the word
[1:18:45] and you know when they don't like it
[1:18:46] they can sit right here and you preach
[1:18:49] that word and that demon manifests
[1:18:50] itself
[1:18:53] that's why God told Ezekiel Jeremiah I
[1:18:56] believe he said don't be afraid of their
[1:18:57] faces
[1:18:59] hey no use of being afraid of people's
[1:19:01] faces great is he that's in me then he
[1:19:05] that is in the world
[1:19:10] token the blood
[1:19:12] The Blood Brothers what do you say
[1:19:13] listen let me tell you something you can
[1:19:15] understand all Mysteries
[1:19:17] and still be lost Paul said so
[1:19:20] [Applause]
[1:19:22] you can have faith to move mountains and
[1:19:25] still be lost
[1:19:27] you gotta have the toe cut yes you got
[1:19:30] to have the Life of Christ on the inside
[1:19:33] amen not on the outside it was pretty
[1:19:35] nice to have the blood on the doorpost
[1:19:37] of the little but now that life of the
[1:19:40] blood I'm not talking about I'm a
[1:19:41] natural lamb I'm talking with the Lamb
[1:19:43] of God must be on the inside working its
[1:19:47] way out yes amen hallelujah
[1:19:50] you love the Lord people to God I don't
[1:19:53] mean to be screaming I didn't know how
[1:19:54] God was going to manifest himself
[1:19:56] tonight but I'm here to let him have his
[1:19:58] way
[1:19:59] you see because we are living in a day I
[1:20:01] I've just been thinking about this
[1:20:03] throughout the day just how we need more
[1:20:06] God
[1:20:09] I'm crying
[1:20:10] not not just for for myself I'm crying
[1:20:14] for the bride yeah I don't know who all
[1:20:16] in this church is bride I wish everybody
[1:20:19] would hear was
[1:20:20] but I cry out Lord break the chains amen
[1:20:25] destroy the yolks give us Grace to
[1:20:28] overcome he will yes it's in his word
[1:20:32] we're more than conquerors in Christ
[1:20:34] Jesus and those are the bride who don't
[1:20:37] have the token God give us the token
[1:20:39] amen bring down your Holy Spirit Break
[1:20:42] Every Chain and dispel every bit of the
[1:20:46] darkness in this place
[1:20:50] despair those who don't want to be here
[1:20:53] get rid of the Lord whoever whoever may
[1:20:56] be because the Bible said well two or
[1:20:58] three are gathered there I am in the
[1:21:00] midst yeah
[1:21:02] I don't have to worry about a large Peak
[1:21:04] number of people oh if they leave I
[1:21:06] ain't going to be able to pay the bill
[1:21:08] they ain't paying the bills anyway
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:14] that's one thing I don't have to worry
[1:21:16] about
[1:21:20] the Holy Ghost is the token
[1:21:22] that we have been parted
[1:21:24] this is coming from the message token
[1:21:26] 1964 308.
[1:21:30] brother banham said the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:32] the token that we have been pardoned yes
[1:21:36] the case is closed see that's why the
[1:21:39] devil got everybody looking everywhere
[1:21:41] trying to feel it up you know with all
[1:21:43] kinds of entertainment and all kinds of
[1:21:46] stuff and the devil will let you come
[1:21:48] right in the church and enjoy yourself
[1:21:52] but with all of that
[1:21:54] he can blind you
[1:21:56] thank God for this message he can blind
[1:22:00] you to make you think you got something
[1:22:01] that you don't have
[1:22:03] but I I tell you what and I know it
[1:22:06] ain't just Divine love it ain't just
[1:22:07] love because you can love a person uh in
[1:22:10] the filial realm but Divine love
[1:22:14] goes way beyond that
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:18] [Music]
[1:22:19] amen see
[1:22:21] we have been pardoned
[1:22:24] and it's true I know situations y'all
[1:22:26] think I'm crazy because I preach on
[1:22:28] certain things but I'm gonna tell you
[1:22:29] something young people are are suffering
[1:22:32] because they see the word
[1:22:35] but they know if they try to perform the
[1:22:37] word
[1:22:38] they will be excommunicated even from
[1:22:41] their families
[1:22:44] it's serious
[1:22:46] and if they're not excommunicated
[1:22:48] they're going to be mistreated
[1:22:50] and it ain't even a word
[1:22:54] traditions
[1:22:56] in this message
[1:22:58] the sad part about this
[1:23:01] is that when they're when they're when
[1:23:02] the evangelists when they went to these
[1:23:04] different countries they may have given
[1:23:06] them the message but but never helped
[1:23:08] circumcise them
[1:23:12] so now this thing has been so deep in it
[1:23:15] it'll take God to make a change
[1:23:20] yeah
[1:23:22] if people did that and understood it
[1:23:24] with tradition it would be a problem but
[1:23:26] when you make it the word
[1:23:29] when you make it that a man or a woman
[1:23:31] don't if they don't do it this way
[1:23:32] they're sinful
[1:23:34] where they where is that scripture
[1:23:36] that's Darkness that's not life amen
[1:23:39] anyway let me get off that
[1:23:41] the case is closed
[1:23:44] to every man and woman that truly
[1:23:46] true let's receive the
[1:23:51] he he is identified with his attorney
[1:23:56] with his judge with his sacrifice and
[1:24:00] the token he holds in his possession
[1:24:02] shows that his trip is paid to glory
[1:24:05] amen amen hallelujah it's all over he
[1:24:11] holds that token
[1:24:12] it's his the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:15] which is the witness of the resurrection
[1:24:18] of Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:20] hallelujah if you get the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:23] you ain't changed you don't have it
[1:24:26] because when the Holy Ghost comes it
[1:24:28] changes you you don't change it you
[1:24:31] don't even have to work at it it works
[1:24:33] you
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:37] that's your identification you're
[1:24:39] holding the token now if you haven't got
[1:24:42] the token you will not be coming in
[1:24:45] huh you mean to tell me I've been
[1:24:47] faithful to the church faithful as a
[1:24:49] deacon faithful as it is faithful as a
[1:24:51] pastor I'm gonna say Pastor too because
[1:24:53] a lot of pastors don't have it yeah
[1:24:57] you must have the token that's the
[1:25:00] required price amen amen when I see the
[1:25:03] blood
[1:25:04] the blood is the token amen when I see
[1:25:07] the blood I'll pass over you
[1:25:10] you must have the token and if you don't
[1:25:13] why you won't go amen you gotta have the
[1:25:17] token now I'm gonna say this by the
[1:25:20] grace of God a lot of people got it
[1:25:23] and they have allowed the devil to make
[1:25:25] them think they don't have it
[1:25:27] dude you say that's not possible it is
[1:25:30] possible
[1:25:31] because if you don't read and study your
[1:25:34] faith is weak
[1:25:36] and that token operates by your faith
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:40] amen you can have it but be a weak
[1:25:42] Christian
[1:25:44] right and that's what has happened to a
[1:25:46] lot of people listen I know what I'm
[1:25:48] talking about I've been there
[1:25:50] I'm not preaching something I'm not I
[1:25:52] don't know what I'm talking about I've
[1:25:54] been there
[1:25:55] but one thing the devil could never tell
[1:25:57] me he could never tell me I didn't have
[1:26:00] it
[1:26:01] oh he could say it
[1:26:03] but I'll tell him like this you wasn't
[1:26:05] there
[1:26:09] who would God save me
[1:26:11] when God filled me where were you
[1:26:15] because this is the relationship between
[1:26:18] me and Jesus and we didn't have a third
[1:26:20] party
[1:26:23] Hallelujah y'all see what I'm saying I'm
[1:26:25] not trying to beat anybody up I'm trying
[1:26:28] to help us tonight so that we can search
[1:26:31] and like David Lord if there be any
[1:26:34] wicked thing in me please deliver amen
[1:26:37] get it out of me I'm not preaching to
[1:26:39] one person I'm preaching to everybody
[1:26:41] even myself
[1:26:45] Hallelujah
[1:26:47] glory to God I I I I want to grow more
[1:26:51] I want to see that Divine Love Song
[1:26:53] display if somebody sped in my face I
[1:26:56] can say okay God bless you
[1:26:59] see y'all looking at me but most of us
[1:27:01] ain't there yet
[1:27:04] you know somebody can slap you do
[1:27:07] whatever you know you want to be able to
[1:27:08] do like Jesus
[1:27:10] open out your mouth
[1:27:12] Little Folks this might sound crazy but
[1:27:15] I'm gonna tell you something when the
[1:27:16] squeeze comes
[1:27:18] when and it's on his way don't tell me
[1:27:21] it's not on his way Christianity that
[1:27:24] brother Adam said he said oh and oh Lord
[1:27:27] once more
[1:27:28] one of those messages was Samson he said
[1:27:31] before Samson they had all of the side
[1:27:33] activities the monkeys and all of that
[1:27:35] dude he said but that wasn't the main
[1:27:37] attention that was the main that was not
[1:27:39] the main attraction he said Samson and
[1:27:43] Samson represented that old Fallen
[1:27:45] Church Samson was the main attraction
[1:27:48] so let me tell you like this with all of
[1:27:51] this stuff going on you know who's the
[1:27:53] main attraction this message yes
[1:27:56] people who believe this message all the
[1:28:00] other churches are apostate and all of
[1:28:02] that they they gone they've been tried
[1:28:05] found one
[1:28:07] judgment is already struck them amen
[1:28:10] they so eat up with worldliness it's the
[1:28:13] truth but this message have stood the
[1:28:16] test of time and it's going to stay
[1:28:19] because we've been our day to say Amen
[1:28:24] anybody that followed Jesus will suffer
[1:28:27] persecution amen
[1:28:29] amen that's what today they're trying to
[1:28:31] mix everything else with this Creeds and
[1:28:34] affiliations and all kinds of
[1:28:36] entertainments and everything but it
[1:28:38] won't mix
[1:28:40] there is absolutely see it will not mix
[1:28:43] with anything the blood would not miss
[1:28:47] and it's just it must be eaten ready
[1:28:50] dressed people ready for the journey and
[1:28:52] I'm like okay ready for the journey
[1:28:55] let's just stop that ready for the
[1:28:57] journey
[1:28:58] and you see with everybody it's like I
[1:29:02] don't know how I was on the Titanic but
[1:29:03] I I can imagine
[1:29:05] some people were running back for their
[1:29:07] jewelry and running back for their goal
[1:29:10] they were more concerned about those
[1:29:11] things that they were their lives and
[1:29:13] because they they couldn't let it go
[1:29:16] they went down with the normally
[1:29:19] that's the way
[1:29:22] everything go down
[1:29:25] you know you get and you hit the water
[1:29:26] or whatever say leave everything just
[1:29:29] jump out into the boat or whatever but I
[1:29:31] guarantee you people say oh I can't
[1:29:33] leave my laptop yeah
[1:29:36] but it's those moments that decide where
[1:29:40] you live or die
[1:29:42] that's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:29:44] choose you this day
[1:29:46] amen life or death amen
[1:29:49] hey you gotta understand when it's
[1:29:53] finished it's finished and I'm gonna
[1:29:55] tell you one of the things that got me
[1:29:57] so so excited because I read Jeremiah
[1:30:00] and all I could see is the world
[1:30:02] I see everything we're doing right now
[1:30:05] Jeremiah had to deal with it with Israel
[1:30:08] and when God get fed up
[1:30:12] Mama Daddy's sister and brother can't
[1:30:14] help you no
[1:30:16] read it and everywhere those Israelites
[1:30:19] when they were not obedient but you see
[1:30:21] the the the the the flip side of this
[1:30:24] thing is is that when Babylon began to
[1:30:27] rule we've been told to resist it
[1:30:31] in that day they were told to accept it
[1:30:36] our day is that if you allow yourself to
[1:30:39] fall into that system you receive the
[1:30:42] mark of the beast
[1:30:46] Hallelujah I'm almost done people I
[1:30:49] sound like I'm fussing I'm loving the
[1:30:50] people I'm loving you and because I care
[1:30:53] yeah I'm a Watchman
[1:30:56] amen I'm on the wall I see things
[1:30:59] and I'm trying my best to make sound the
[1:31:01] alarm in Zion
[1:31:04] because that's where we are and living
[1:31:06] in Christianity a Christian life doesn't
[1:31:08] mean that you can't laugh and have joy
[1:31:12] that's not what I'm saying you don't
[1:31:14] have to walk around like a board or a
[1:31:17] stiff robot I'm holy no
[1:31:20] the Holy Ghost and you will make you
[1:31:22] holy
[1:31:23] it's your boundaries
[1:31:26] not because what you think is your
[1:31:28] boundaries amen
[1:31:31] Hallelujah
[1:31:34] it sets your boundaries is what I'm
[1:31:36] trying to say
[1:31:38] and when this was applied the people
[1:31:40] must be ready for the journey
[1:31:43] it isn't for the unbelievers standing
[1:31:46] outside and sympathizing with it it's
[1:31:49] for the believer that's already under
[1:31:52] the blood already dressed sod stabbed in
[1:31:57] his hand his loins girdled and ready for
[1:32:00] the travel he didn't say getting ready
[1:32:02] he said they're already ready
[1:32:05] and we're talking about oh we're going
[1:32:07] in the Rapture my question is are you
[1:32:09] ready
[1:32:14] have the word dressed you yes thank you
[1:32:18] Lord see there are two types of people
[1:32:21] the children of God and the children of
[1:32:22] devil
[1:32:24] and there is no in between amen right
[1:32:27] now and I don't think people fully
[1:32:28] realize that if you can't accept that
[1:32:31] you're a child of God you know what you
[1:32:32] become yeah
[1:32:35] yeah and God knows I'm not a child of
[1:32:36] the devil
[1:32:38] so my point is if you know not know
[1:32:41] you're not a child of the devil why
[1:32:43] don't you just stop
[1:32:46] and be about your father's business
[1:32:49] who are you
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:52] the scripture says for as many that are
[1:32:53] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:32:55] sons of God how are you going to be led
[1:32:57] that by the spirit of God if you don't
[1:32:58] even have it
[1:33:01] Hallelujah
[1:33:03] Jesus even told those disciples in Saint
[1:33:06] John 8 44-46 ye are of your father the
[1:33:09] devil and the lust of your father ye
[1:33:11] will do huh the last time your father
[1:33:14] you would do he was a murderer from the
[1:33:16] beginning and Abode not in the truth
[1:33:18] because there is no truth in him amen
[1:33:20] hey you don't have to shoot with the gun
[1:33:22] you can shoot with the tongue
[1:33:25] amen and when he speak of the LIE he
[1:33:28] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[1:33:30] the father of it
[1:33:32] you know most people can't take this
[1:33:34] this kind of message
[1:33:35] you know what I mean every you know you
[1:33:36] go to churches now they they preach
[1:33:39] Papa feel good message
[1:33:42] what'll make you feel good
[1:33:45] Hallelujah I just want you to make I
[1:33:47] just want to make you feel good no
[1:33:50] I don't know how you're gonna feel good
[1:33:52] with me slicing and dicing with the
[1:33:54] sword
[1:33:56] you're supposed to hurt yes
[1:33:58] yes it's supposed to go deep yes yes and
[1:34:01] sometimes it's supposed to make you bad
[1:34:03] angry with the better word
[1:34:06] but if you're a true seed of God you say
[1:34:09] Thank You Lord amen thank you Lord amen
[1:34:14] thank you Hallelujah and the bull not a
[1:34:17] truth because there is no truth in him
[1:34:19] when he's speaketh the lie he's speaking
[1:34:21] of his own for he is a liar and the
[1:34:23] father of it that people don't
[1:34:25] understand what craze and dogwoods are
[1:34:27] doing to him I use that for example but
[1:34:29] this people in this message got all
[1:34:31] kinds of crazy stuff going on
[1:34:33] and they don't even see it they
[1:34:35] denominated and did everything to it and
[1:34:37] bring everything into them you know I
[1:34:39] mean it's just crazy it just doesn't
[1:34:41] make sense
[1:34:44] instead of teaching the people to try to
[1:34:45] try to try to try to walk up that ladder
[1:34:48] of a perfect statue of Christ
[1:34:49] we teach them everything else
[1:34:52] and that is the most important thing
[1:34:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:58] oh nothing else matters that's right
[1:35:01] that's the thing that's why president
[1:35:03] said drop everything no matter what
[1:35:06] make sure you
[1:35:08] show you make sure you get that Holy
[1:35:10] Ghost amen I'm I'm almost on this last
[1:35:13] one
[1:35:14] coming from the same message he said the
[1:35:16] token was above the Covenant remember I
[1:35:19] said that I said because you know what
[1:35:21] the prophet God said it did not matter
[1:35:24] if they were a Jew
[1:35:26] and have been circumcised only eight
[1:35:28] days
[1:35:30] when the death angel came he could care
[1:35:32] he cared nothing about that Covenant
[1:35:35] that Covenant was done
[1:35:39] God don't care about how much through
[1:35:40] church and what church you go to
[1:35:42] oh yeah no
[1:35:45] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:35:48] you believe
[1:35:50] that what's bringing the company when
[1:35:52] those two pieces come together
[1:35:55] you say oh I've been in the message all
[1:35:57] my life but have you received the Holy
[1:35:59] Ghost since
[1:36:00] do you really have to talk at oh what
[1:36:03] are you saying you and I keep saying
[1:36:05] this thing about forgiveness because God
[1:36:07] that Jesus birth the church I'm honor
[1:36:10] amen you see all the Old Testament
[1:36:12] churches John Joseph and all of them
[1:36:15] they were burned those women with
[1:36:17] Brothers said when they were
[1:36:18] impregnation when they were actually
[1:36:20] delivering the baby they would say leave
[1:36:23] from they they literally blessed them by
[1:36:26] the word spoken and when Jesus was
[1:36:29] giving birth Amen to the truth New
[1:36:31] Testament Church he birthed her under
[1:36:34] forgiveness father forgive them for they
[1:36:38] know not what they do you say how can
[1:36:41] you prove that that same spirit that
[1:36:43] Stephen was birthed under he said father
[1:36:46] hold not this to their child that's the
[1:36:50] True Believer amen that's how you know
[1:36:52] you've been born again when you can
[1:36:54] forgive yeah because the devil don't
[1:36:58] know nothing about that amen amen amen
[1:37:00] truly forgive
[1:37:02] you say well I can't forget God didn't
[1:37:04] ask you to forget but he did ask you
[1:37:06] forgive me
[1:37:11] was above the Covenant
[1:37:14] but Israel had a covenant to be
[1:37:15] circumcised
[1:37:17] and any Jew could go out and show any
[1:37:20] person I can prove to you I am
[1:37:22] circumcised I am a Jew I am circumcised
[1:37:26] according to Jehovah's command but yet
[1:37:28] that didn't expel him if the token
[1:37:32] wasn't there also he must display the
[1:37:36] token you get it the token has to be
[1:37:39] there anyhow if you are in the Covenant
[1:37:43] if any Jew would say I ain't putting on
[1:37:47] no blood on my door I can prove that I
[1:37:50] am a covenant Jew the death angel got it
[1:37:52] yes no matter how loyal he was how much
[1:37:56] church member he was how much tithes he
[1:37:59] paid how he said he believed Jehovah
[1:38:02] Jehovah is required that token and he's
[1:38:05] he and he he does it today too and
[1:38:08] that's what makes this message so great
[1:38:10] because we came at a time when Church
[1:38:14] believed on my spoken tongues if I did
[1:38:16] if I shout if I belong this church or
[1:38:18] that church and all that uh no no no you
[1:38:21] can believe all that you can belong all
[1:38:23] to that but without the token without
[1:38:26] the true Holy Ghost you have no Covenant
[1:38:29] with God Amen that's why people prayers
[1:38:31] are not here amen
[1:38:34] you can't fake this it's got to be real
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:39] he does it today too it's got to be it
[1:38:43] must be but there is not another way
[1:38:46] under heaven and let me clarify that
[1:38:49] because God asks a prayer in his own
[1:38:51] good time
[1:38:55] so I don't the devil say see you ain't
[1:38:57] got it because your prayer hasn't been
[1:38:58] answered no if you got it you wait till
[1:39:01] it be answered amen
[1:39:04] but there is not another way under
[1:39:07] heaven not another name given anyway no
[1:39:11] matter how good how loyal that token has
[1:39:15] got to be there and displayed amen right
[1:39:18] the blood you say well I kill the lamb
[1:39:21] and I put it in a job
[1:39:24] I've said it back here that's not what
[1:39:27] he said it must be on the little and on
[1:39:30] the door place it's got to be displayed
[1:39:33] you know what that door place is your
[1:39:35] heart amen and your life has got to
[1:39:39] display the token is in you amen oh you
[1:39:43] got you Pentecostal what's wrong with
[1:39:45] you what's wrong with you bobbed hair
[1:39:47] painted faces man dirty jokes and things
[1:39:50] where that display the blood of my Lord
[1:39:52] Jesus Christ is the token of the Holy
[1:39:55] Ghost you're having a form of godliness
[1:39:57] and calling Witchcraft and everything
[1:39:59] else the work of God
[1:40:01] oh Pentecostal witchcraft how you
[1:40:05] display the token
[1:40:07] they say I'm a Pentecost I don't care
[1:40:09] what you are I'm a Baptist I'm a
[1:40:11] presbyterian I don't care what you are
[1:40:13] that token has got to be there God
[1:40:16] requires it and nothing else but that
[1:40:22] choose you to stay
[1:40:24] Who you gonna serve
[1:40:26] I got more but I'm gonna stop right here
[1:40:29] choose you this day
[1:40:37] I don't worry
[1:40:39] like brother said
[1:40:42] God's faith having faith in God and
[1:40:45] believing and knowing that somehow I am
[1:40:47] elected and chosen to be bride God will
[1:40:50] bring that to manifestation amen
[1:40:53] I read that scripture where he said they
[1:40:55] shall be mine said the Lord
[1:40:57] in Malachi 3 16 18 right he said then
[1:41:02] they fear the lord speak often one to
[1:41:05] another and the Lord hearkened and heard
[1:41:08] it in a book of remembrance was written
[1:41:10] before him but them that fear the lord
[1:41:12] and that thought upon his name and
[1:41:14] you'll have people in this message when
[1:41:16] you fellowship with them they don't want
[1:41:18] you talking about the law
[1:41:20] they don't mind you talking about
[1:41:21] anything else but you can overdo that
[1:41:23] one
[1:41:24] people need the Holy Ghost yeah yeah
[1:41:29] that's why people don't have the joy
[1:41:30] they don't have strength because they
[1:41:31] have no joy and the box is the joy of
[1:41:34] the Lord is our strength amen
[1:41:37] and they shall be mine said the Lord of
[1:41:39] hosts in that day when I make up my
[1:41:41] Jewels I will spare them as a man
[1:41:44] spareth his own son that serveth him
[1:41:47] right then shall ye return and discern
[1:41:51] between righteous and the wicked between
[1:41:54] him that serveth God and him that serve
[1:41:57] him
[1:41:58] last day
[1:42:15] you know I find out that you can't just
[1:42:18] let a love Spirit run your day all day
[1:42:21] and then come up in here acting like
[1:42:24] you're saying goodbye
[1:42:28] people do not know they do it
[1:42:31] and they carry On and Here they look at
[1:42:34] battles on top of battles and then they
[1:42:36] know you come early enough to pray them
[1:42:38] demons off of them
[1:42:40] and don't you know demons when they come
[1:42:43] to church
