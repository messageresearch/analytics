TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Lord I pray Lord that you would give us Grace give us we love you Lord we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ pray amen amen you love the Lord we thank God for his grace let's stand we we're still working with Jeremiah but I want to start off with uh Jude we're going to start we're going to read a scripture from Jude then we're going to do a little um uh synopsis of what we've already uh uh done uh here in the book of Jeremiah we want to try to wrap it up tonight by the grace of God and and uh so we're going to move maybe a little faster than we normally do uh Jude 1 and it reads from the third verse beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there's a certain men crept in unawares who was before of ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the Lord had saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not and the angels would kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he have reserved in Everlasting chains Into Darkness until the Judgment of the great day you're going to read Jeremiah 50 we read the third through the 5ifth verse Jeremiah 50 beginning the third verse for out of the North there cometh up a nation against us I see against her which shall make her land desolate and None Shall dwell therein they shall remove they shall depart both man and Beast and in those days in that time said the Lord the children of Israel shall come they and the children of Judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the Lord their God they shall ask the way of Zion with their faces thitherward saying come and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant that shall not be forgotten let us pray Heavenly Father once again we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for the reading of your word we we thank you for those who are here tonight we pray that you would bless Lord the reading of your word Quicken it to us Lord oh God give us understanding Hallelujah that we may be able to see what your perfect will is bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated yeah we uh by the grace of God want to uh thank the Lord for what we've gotten out of book of Jeremiah I know that um we um how can I say it we we know that uh uh it was it's been it's been a real big book it is a book a great book uh but we want want to also we hit we we tried to hit some of the highlights of it so that you would get a better understanding of our day you know to me when I read Jeremiah I think about all of the uh things that are happening here in America and I know by the by God's grace that Jeremiah seemed like he was looking right into our day seeing all the corruption and stuff that is going on among the church and remember now Israel was the Church of God and because of their Disobedience God allowed Babylon to overtake them Babylon is not just a city but it's a spirit and those of us who know a little history about Babylon it's started in Genesis with uh the towel of Babel uh with Nimrod ruling the people and bringing them together to outsmart God and they left whatever Faith they had you know they had Faith because the Bible said Enoch walk with God you know and though they did not have you know uh how can I say it letter a written word they it was like Word of Mouth Word of Mouth God you know and we don't know all that were taught you know but I'm sure Adam and Eve played their part in teaching their children that's what the seed of God do that's what we do so we know by the grace of God that even it it was passed on down and then we find out that somehow men going to be men men can't change we're Beast you know I mean we're animals we we're the worst kind because of the Demonic power that occupies our bodies and our spirit I mean you know very rarely do you find demons in in animals but they do that do occur sometimes too uh because demons can't find people kind of in in like they would like to but my point is is that the habit of man can't change until God gives them a birth and no matter how God blesses you you know if you don't stay with God you you're going to change into what the people of Israel changed into uh they their lives became miserable but they really thought they were having a great time uh Babylon was built like I said by the hunter Nimrod and that's in Genesis 10 9-10 and had it a great power uh under the King Nebuchadnezzar who rebuilt the city to become one of the showpieces of the ancient world and we know that according to Daniel 4:29 and3 but God's Prophet saw the city as a symbol of Babylon which was a which was uh embodied with pride and and embod it embodied a great king now so you understand that when you see great Kings it's just not Kings behind the curtain there is a king a spiritual King a demonic King right so so we understand when when in the Book of Revelation when it talks about those demons coming out of the Euphrates look how it's changed not only America but the world and the world don't even know that's what changed them and what these demons did they got into the political rim and they changed the order of the law because law always keeps Satan aey you know keeps him bound but when laws are broken and a nation becomes un uh what's unlaw uh where laws mean nothing then that's when Satan has his free course it's almost like when a a cancer gets into you or a germ gets into you and there's no no Battleground no battles your immune system don't can't fight you see what I'm saying so laws in a way becomes an immune system uh for a nation but the ancient city um like I said at Babylon it was it was uh there it started and and and the thing about it is the mankind had drifted so far from God to the only righteous man you had in the early Babylon uh time of Noah wouldn't call Babylon then but in the time of Noah and all of that uh we know that the same spirits that that that was on uh uh uh um Nimrod was also the same ones that crossed over the flood you see that's that's what people don't understand the spirits crosses over however we turn they turn whatever God turns they turn and and they all are there for to serve a purpose and that purpose is to show good from evil or even from good now we understand that they got into all of the lasciviousness and all of the Abominable things that that man do and when I say that I mean we know what the scripture says men get so bad that they get into beology all kinds of perverted things and those are the things that God hates this thing is not new Solomon said there's no new thing under the sun and the reason why I'm saying all of this is because now Jude writes to us said be careful he doesn't say the same thing that happened to Babylon will happen to you or the same thing that happened to the Jews will happen to you but because what they they they they walked away from the laws of God and they got into the laws of Satan right and that's when they began to do the works and the acts of Satan right I heard the prophet of God say today on on a future home and he was talking about those that are are are predestinated and born to be the children of God they will receive the message amen that's what he said he said they are the ones who goes to the Future home amen they have eyes to see God has ordained them to see that yeah he doesn't say the others are not saved but he said these ones who receive the message they take a Rapture right so when you when you see that God has a plan as I said the other day there's a table prepared and God has that thing laid out you know have you ever had your Army mens and everything else and you you you got a table and you got the Blue Jackets against the you know how that works and and that's how God it's just a little piece of God's mind coming into play when we do that and you already know who's going to win and God knows who's going to win now I'm saying all of this to to bring you to a place cuz I'm going to bring you up to our day but Israel got to a place that they were totally backsliding they they did the very thing God told them not to do and that is to stay away from the Nations the other nations don't get into their habits don't do what they do and Israel came and got did the same thing and really when you get to a place that you have become so carnal you resent God and that's B what what happened to Israel they didn't want the correction you know they want to block out their minds in their minds well God is dead and like some people of our day say God delayeth his coming see it's the same Spirit that's trying to convince you that God's word is not going to come to pass but we understand also all all all all all about around with uh how can I say it when it came to to all the countries that Israel was engaged to God not only judged Israel but God judged the Nations as well and the punishment in which God brought unto Israel was also the punishment that God brought to the Nations that conquered Israel amen see what I'm saying so you say well what do you mean remember when when Nebuchadnezzar was a big man I mean statue over him you know all of that was in Prophecy and everything and at the end God destroys Nebuchadnezzar he used him as a vessel Of Dishonor to destroy the ones who supposed to be of Honor but then God never forgets his people you know what I'm saying so we understand that that's what happened amen and it was all about their pride see you get lifted up you say what no it couldn't have been Pride but what was it when when Cain says am I My Brother's Keeper he got sassy he was prideful that's why the Bible said Pride come just before the fall now though the Lord have pronounced judgment on Israel and brought them into captivity and they were to go into captivity for 70 years and I'm in I'm in Jeremiah now God also prophesied judgment against Babylon for doing so right and and think about this it's see you see people and you think to yourself it's not happening no history repeats itself the very people that God delivered uh out of the out of out of Egypt uh with with the message are some of the same people that went back am right they didn't they didn't they didn't want to continue and you know they begin to almost blaspheme if I want to say it like this because they they they basically cursed not only the prophet but the teachings of the Prophet not knowing that that was not a man that was God in a man see so God promised also that with all of the destruction how can I say it the Bible said God never leaves himself without a witness and even though God bring instruction if you change if you go from Genesis all the way to our day there's always a Remnant y God always save a Remnant and the Bride of Jesus Christ is what we call the remnant right so we ought to be really excited to know that we're living in these last days where Babylon is going to be destroyed is that the word that's the word but now the whole world is under the spirit of Babylon that's right if you read Revelations which I'm coming to it shows that all of the Kings gave their power to the Beast into the and who was she mystery Babylon the great so we're now in the in the very we're being enveloped uh how could I say is that the right word uh in the situ ation where the spirit of Babylon confusion now AR we in confusion here yeah but understand in all of that confusion there was still a king and there's still a king the world don't see the king but just just just as Nimrod was the king we've got a king that we call the pope and y'all know how that's going to work that's Babylon mystery Babylon the great she still lives amen and if God brought judgment on the towel of Babel and then the other he brought judgment on Babylon itself right under Nebuchadnezzar and all of them Canan find basically where where it was but I I know where it was that's why we we look at this situation where was babyon it was right there uh took my thought right there with um Iran and Iraq That's Where It's At amen so we see by God's grace that here God is saying listen I'm bringing all of this thing all this judgment on you but there's still a people I haven't forgotten Hallelujah there's still a people that I am going to bring back to my Covenant right because remember when Israel I think it was Darius that set them free if that correct Darius was the one that conquered uh um Babylon and I I might have the name wrong but I know I'm Cyrus Cyrus was the one that set him free but I think when when you think about um how God raised him up CU Babylon was great it was great there was nobody that could conquer and it was so strong that God had to bring Cyrus right to set him free now when you think about that that and how brother Ram said that Babylon will continue on until Jesus come himself nobody can stop her amen nobody can stop her but Christ himself now we we we say these because the the news of what the Lord had done to Israel was well known now is wasn't Israel wasn't just destroyed but all the neighbors everybody in the world knew that now Israel is done and and most of the countries would say their God is no longer with them where they were right even though they had not heard the prophecy that Jesus talked about when he talks about destroying this the the city in in the time when Titus came through and see it's it's like the the scripture always have a manifold meaning it never stops it just never stops and you know because the reason why because God can't change he can't change and when situations may meet the same position uh that Babylon or all the other cities that's why you see brother you see God sometimes describing a Old Testament event like Sodom and gomorah or in the days of Noah or because people have come back to that same position that they were in during that time of Destruction and see God can't change if he destroyed them he's going to destroy us you understand me right so let's go to Jeremiah 50 and7 to just to know that God is is is is is is getting ready to end this thing and what we don't understand or don't know is that it's already begun I think I know when the seven seal will open or when the angel however people want to say they get stuck on the six and the seventh and I heard what people said well the seven Church ain't age it's not over well brother brandom said it is in the future home he said it was over amen that's right he the seventh seven he went through all of the church ages and then he got to the seventh Church agent he said the seventh Church agent is O we're we're in and it and it's over somehow he said it but but nevertheless my point is people are wrestling with that because they don't know the time is changed we're not in the seventh age we in in a Eternal age amen and and that's what people don't understand if you if you stuck in the seven you won't see what you're going to see in the eth see but in this in this day uh we we must understand that time has changed it's it was when when when how can I say it like this even though it was the ending of time it was the beginning of the fullness of time when the fullness of time has come see and that's what the prophet of God shared with us that when these things happen it doesn't just all of a sudden all happen at one time no it has a time period allotted to it so here in Jeremiah 50:7 all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said we offend them we offend not because they have sinned against the Lord the habitation of of of Justice even the Lord the hope of their father so when you see the attitude of the people then you can even see the attitude of the people now amen and all of the world they see you know they want to walk on the Jews am I getting this right they want to walk on the Jews they want to step on them because they feel like hey God ain't with them no more God has left them but what they do not see is the the the the time and the scripture that this people are right where God wants them to be amen that's true and everybody no matter where you go hate Jews and don't know why the Same Spirit this is Babylon so this Spirit must be here too the hatred of Jews must be here too because the hatred of Jews was in the days of Jeremiah you understand me it it's it's just always that way and so it is with the Christian right because what was wrong she was Babylon now you know she was she was killed or put put to death but she rose again that's it now she's a mystery but who is she yeah she came back up right and now people think oh the old Rome is gone no that Rome is here and she's worse in the first amen yes sir and if whatever those Spirits were in Jeremiah they here yes they they're here and they're among Christians right now and you always got those prophets like Jeremiah trying to tell the people but listen what brother God said to to Jeremiah I called you and then he brings in predestination he brings an election and he said and and and I'm going tell you these people are not going to listen and that's where we are sir that's exactly right we are at that position you can tell them all you want to the world is coming to an end nobody listens noen because they full of lust full of pleasure full of this and full of that and don't have no Holy Ghost and they do not understand they have been ordained to be this now listen when Jude was speaking he wasn't talking about the world he was telling talking to the church the church will become to a place where they would become lasciviousness and and whatever more with the fornication and with all the other things that that churches are doing man I heard some things I've heard some things that it was just hard for me to believe that people were doing in churches you know and then then my boy sent me something where what was that Tony Evans he's stepping down because he's done I don't know the whole situation but my point is this when you get great leaders and that's that's the thing people don't pray for preachers but let me tell you something Satan love the domino effect if he can hit that key pin it it's and that's I switch from dominoes to bowling but y'all know what I mean but but the point is that's where we are but listen this is why the Bible said you you know don't put your trust in the arm of Flesh always trust God yes sir yes sir so Jeremiah 23 it says how is the hammer of the whole earth cut a sun and broken how is Babylon become a desolation among the Nations I have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken oh Babylon and thou Hast ha thou was not aware thou art found and also caught because thou have driven striven against the Lord hello what what is the world doing what is is America doing we're striving against him yes we're fighting against him everything the word stands for they're doing just the opposite boldly Doing It With Pride right I heard a little my uh friend gave me a little clipping today this girl on the on the internet she says I know you're going to get mad with me she said but the rainbow belongs to God and pride is evil right so so now they got this thing moving I said well when is pride month month is now so how can you have pride and not be against God it's pride and then you take his Covenant and place it as yours flag no it's it's total outright Blasphemous and rebellious you know rebelling but it doesn't matter God has already said what's going to happen we don't have to say nothing God has already declared it right the Lord have opened his Armory and have brought forth the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the lord of the host in the land of the Chans and you and I know that what God is doing now is what he intend to do all of these plagues food shortage I don't care who they say doing it but these people are inspired to do what they're doing to bring mankind to their needes so that they can group them together as did nimrod and God's not surprised and God is not surprised right cuz we repeat the same thing over and over again like okay this did you know they did this back there so where we are today I love Jeremiah for what I've come to see and understand the point is that all nations all of Israel was judged and the Nations that persecuted her was judged but then at the end of the road Israel came back and all the other nations died you see what I'm saying so that's what people don't understand God has his hand yes sir on the Christian and the Jews yep yeah yes sir and now we we're getting ready to see something in our nation and but by the grace of God God has already prepared the table before me yeah you anointed my head with oil you know I mean so we don't have to be concerned fear not little flock but these things are going to happen why because that if America church had not failed America would be still strong see God church God judges the church first according to Ezekiel God said go by the house of God go by there where the Ancients are the old people they know the way but look at them none of them have sealed the church members from the old to the young but they don't have the ceiling of the Holy Spirit he said destroy them all and that's what's going to happen in our day we're going to see it we're going to see the destruction of the world as well as the church the bride is the only thing we get out of here safely right right turn to Revelations 148 Revelations 148 and there followed another Angel saying Babylon is Fallen is Fallen the great City because she made all nations drink of the wine and the wrath of her fornication and that's what I was saying earlier All Nations have drunk from her cup and now they all guilty and they all will be judged right because that was the influence of the old Babylon old Babylon influenced the whole world around them y'all know that's the truth it's like oh like USA we have influenced the whole world Amen and the reason why we were able to influence the whole world because we scripturally there in Revelations 13 tied to the Beast right we're part of Babylon and we influen the world now if the first Babylon Babel God destroyed God destroyed the second Babylon and now here come what here we are yes sir Babylon again but it's a but all the keys to being successful is right in the word stay with God stay with God no matter how corrupt people become you've got to stay with God Revelation 18 yes sir yes Daniel 2 yes sir 18 four is Deliverance so Revelation 182 through3 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils right and the whole of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and what hateful bird and the prophet of God said I'm paraphrasing what they did to the Jews would seemed like a picnic compare what they're going to do to these these uh foolish virgins yeah may God have mercy cuz that what people say oh I'll be foolish but let me tell you something that ain't going to be easy that when somebody start hitting your flesh and able to uh they say they look for death and can't find it amen people going to want to die kill me Lord no you got to suffer this out to that appointed time it's a horrible thing when you think about it but I'm I'm going say it you know I'm getting getting ready to get to Jeremiah 552 I'm I'm trying to hurry but let's read this uh Revelations uh yeah I just read that and so that's what babyon was if it was that if it's this like this it says uh unclean and hateful bird and for all the nations have drunk of her wine of her wrath Wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed what fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies now let me ask you something I know this to be true they were called a Rome what we call the big farmer and all of these people and they call he called them her his children and then yeah everybody and when they came back America was destroyed don't tell me it ain't right cuz I know it's right and and I'm going tell you something we get news so much later I was over in England I was over in England and and and and I saw the president who was Obama with the Pope don't you know that it almost took a whole year before they put it on our news as if it was happening that day or the day before I saw it with my own eyes America we blind amen news the news media have kept a lot of truth from us amen and we don't even realize like I said I might get in trouble but we don't realize how Wicked our country has become amen but a lot of the people who've had to deal with us know it hard to believe but it's true the Bible say she came up like a lamb but then after while she was a dragon and that's exactly what we have become sir Isaiah please Isaiah 21 Isaiah 216 for thus ha the Lord said unto me go set a Watchman let him declare what he seeth and he saw a chariot a couple of Horsemen a CH Chariot of asses and a chariot of camels and he hearkened diligently with much heed and he cried a lion my Lord I stand continually upon the Watchtower in the daytime and I am set in my w Ward whole nights and behold there come a chariot of men with a couple of horses and he said and answered he said Babylon is Fallen is fallen and all the great images of God he have broken into the ground oh my threshing and the corns of my floor that which I have heard of The Lord of hosts the Lord of Israel have I declared now it let let's let's let's go back to Isaiah 52 I mean sorry Jeremiah 52 God is real there's no new thing under the sun no new thing now zedekiah was was the king whatever he was that that withstood the prophecy of Jeremiah and if you know what happened to him he wasn't just killed readily and I'm going to read it in just a bit but his eyes were plucked out he types out basically lat see thrown in the prison and he died there but you see when it comes to uh uh uh God's word people don't realize that there's a penalty for not obeying and as I've heard uh others say you know God never gave us the law as a punishment he God gave us the law to keep us safe to keep us from getting diseases he wanted us to live long happy you know he told us the things that we we shouldn't do to maintain our marriages our children everything and it was just not just given to us to imprison us but really it became imprisonment to those who didn't want to do it amen and so is it with the word of God now it becomes a burden to the people who don't want to live it right so let's read uh uh starting with uh Jeremiah 52 we'll finish up here by the grace of God believe yeah they don't they don't they don't there's nothing in them to to believe it's de it it just you you listen I think about what it is you got to realize at this point in time you can witness all you want to that's true brother but you can't make a person see and when a person is not thirsty you're can to ask them do you want water and they going to say no thank you it's only the Thirsty person that will take a of your water amen right and we've got so many people that you can witness to I look at several people I brought here but but where are they they were so happy about the message and what I was showing them but they're not here anymore what was that I mean was I broken in heart absolutely but I realized one thing for certain either they'll come around later or they just not I don't know which it is only time will tell zedekiah was one and 20 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was H huu the daughter of Jeremiah of libna and he did that which was evil in the sight of the eyes of the Lord according to all that Jobo jerim had done but through the anger of the Lord though the anger of the Lord uh excuse me through the a for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in J Jerusalem and Judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the 10th month in the 10th day of uh 10th day day of the month that neucha king of Babylon came he and all his Army against Jerusalem and pitched against it and built Fort forts against against it round about now I'm saying all the reading this because this is exactly what Jeremiah told them was going to happen amen but they didn't believe it they believe all the other false prophets right and what did it do it got them into trouble now we think as Christians we have a hard time but if you was a prophet you had an extra hard time amen right because people persecuted you most of the time they didn't believe you now we we know about lamentation that's Jeremiah weeping for the children of Israel amen God told him it was going to be but still he had a love for his people he couldn't help it he couldn't help it because what was he doing display if you want to say the emotions or the feelings of God Amen that wasn't Jeremiah the man that was God in the man crying out for the people when you hear brother brandham cry and begin to weep sometime that wasn't just the man that was God crying out through that body amen trying to get the people to repent but then listen when he got to the place he knew that the message wasn't going to be received God knew then already told him revelation third chapter they put him out y amen see just like Jeremiah they they locked him in jail and and the point is I'm I'm going to bring here is that what have they done to us nobody knows about Willam bradam you can't go to a bookstore no no they shut him down and and and what they did like Israel let his blood be on us and our children cuz that's exactly what they did that kind of decision was the kind of decision that aan made you know that involved his own family see your decision making doesn't just affect you it affect your loved ones as well amen so look what what we did they they rejected the prophet of this day and look at America now she's overwhelmed with evil because they didn't listen right 1956 57 they had a way out God was going to give them that way out uh but but God indicted them because they wouldn't repent it was it was it was actually finished in now we can see it like Israel no respect for God none they they love to be religious Church they come to church Israel came to church did all of their ritual things but their heart was far from him and in the fourth month of the ninth day of the month the famine was so in the city so that there was no bread for the people people of the land now we know that's natural but look at it now there's no bread for the people in the land the only bread that's live and well is the bread that God laid in in store for us that's it Hallelujah you know what I'm saying Joseph had the had the bread you know he had the the the the the meal whatever see and you look at this thing you say well well that's natural but it's the same thing we have come to a place where the people are spiritually dying because there are no living bread then the city was broken up and all the men of War of War fled and went forth out of the city By Night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the King's Garden now the Chans were by the city in other words they had them surrounded there was no way out of it and that's what people don't understand is that Babylon has walls that's why we have to escape out of Babylon we have to we have to go beyond the city that's what Jesus did he had to go beyond be beyond the city walls right but but the army of the Chans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah at the plain of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him then they took the king and carried him up into the king uh unto the king of Babylon to R Rim in the land of HTH where he gave judgment upon him now zedekiah actually mean God is my righteousness can you believe that this was a so-called Christian God is my righteousness that was his name and the king of Babylon slew the son of zedekiah before his eyes he slew allo all the princes of Judah in Rima then he put out the eyes of of zedekiah the and the king of Babylon about him in Chains bound him in Chains and carried him in uh him to Babylon and put him in prison what till the day of his death now can you imagine the only thing this man could see was his children being killed cuz even though his eyes were plucked out his mind still could see and could see every detail in his mind and now he's not only in darkness but he's in out of Darkness because he's in a prison that's dark dark so he's actually cast out and he died in that place what a penalty to pay now in the fifth month in the 10th day of the month which was in the 19th year of Nea king of Babylon came ne ne Zan King of the god which served the king of Babylon in Jerusalem and burn the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem and all the houses of the Great Men burn he with fire now if you understand this God is basically saying you're lost and everybody that didn't obey my commandment because remember when the king first came they were supposed to leave with him don't fight the king cuz he said you fight you going to die you going to die if you don't follow my order you're going to die and that's always the way they did not want to be impr prisoned those who was left behind some of them for various reasons but what happened is God always come back you know that's how it was in Titus uh when Titus came he came to Jerusalem the first time and he left and they thought that was it but he returned you see what I'm saying so demons return Devils return now we in the crooks or the Pinnacle of this Warfare we're getting ready to see the ultimate amen and the only person that's going to be able to get us out of here is Jesus himself amen right and so all the armies of the charin the 14th verse that were with the CH captains of the Guard break down all the walls of Jerusalem round about the Never Never zah radan the king of the god carried away captives certain of the poor of the people and the residents of the people and the remains in the city and those that fell away that that fell to the king of Babylon and the rest of the multitude and so you say well what do you mean even among this group there was foolish virgins amen yeah amen even among this group was foolish virgins amen but they had to suffer you see those who escaped they were considered wise cuz you had who Daniel Shadrach n Beno but in every situation you got wise and foolish wise and foolish right but neuch San the captain of the god left certain of the poor and of the land for V wine Vine dressers and for husbandman also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord and the B es and the brass seed that was in the house of the Lord the chin break and carried all the brass of them to babyon see and what they did not understand is that what they were doing they were carrying their death with them you don't touch the things of God and you'll find out that in in the in the history the very golden cups that they use to celebrate their party after neuch NE was dead his son was raised up and he was the one where God brought the Judgment that same evening that he threw his party you know how the word NE you know yeah and and and and he was the one see that's what people don't understand sometime when judgment comes it doesn't get the immediate group it gets The Offspring it's the generation after usually that judgment falls upon and that's what a lot of people don't understand sometime they say well see God you know spared me yeah not really because I don't know no man would want to see his children lost or destroyed and that's what we did we cursed America cursed her own children right also the pillars of brass so they took all of these things down into Babylon all all the things of the temple and and things of that nature and uh which was prophesied basically they would do all of this but in in all of this let's go to the 24th verse and the captain of the God took Zariah the chief of priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door he took also out out the city an unic which had the charge of men men of of of of war and seven men of them that were near the king's person which were found in the city and he and the principal scribe of the host who murdered in other words they took everything that was valuable in Jerusalem down to Babylon and you say well what was that all about it was all about the three wise men because Daniel was there and Daniel taught Babylon many of the mysteries of God I mean when it comes to the Zodiac and all of these things that's how the wise men were able to read it and know that there was coming a king now I'm not saying all of the wise men knew that but these three did and they were following under the school of death you so you said well what do you mean brother Brooks that even then God have mercy on he on whom he will because I believe that those three wise men that did come from Babylon were saved I believe God received their gifts right so when we see all of these things and we say well Lord what's going to happen you can almost see John God giving him the vision of Babylon and who it was and all and John not seeing anybody to save that could save us not now now it's just not bab the old time Babylon or the one in Daniel he is's now you're seeing the whole world has become Babylon and Lord what's going to happen and here John is looking at this thing says Lord but the angel said weep not John Hallelujah we have one who prevailed right Hallelujah so you say well what do you mean how can I say it in the Conquering when Jesus Christ conquered death Hell In The Grave he conquered all the fruits of death Hell In The Grave every bit of lasv lust of the eye lust of the flesh the pride of life was conquered all of that was conquered and it was all conquered for his own the Bible said he came to save his own amen amen and so when you see all of this you got to realize everybody is not his own he's come to save his own that's right and this message is for his own amen that's right that's just the way it goes L and this is where we are today and I I say it like this I do believe that God revealed things to people even though they don't belong here CU this is not a church building thing amen amen this is what God didn't ask Nicodemus what church you go to no he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe see that's the that's what joins the body together we are baptized into one one body one by by what the Holy Ghost I believe the teaching of this message and as as as brother Randon brings it out on the future home you need to know the messenger you can't without the messenger you don't get the message and that's God's ordained way yes you can't get on Noah's Ark without Noah you can't get into heaven without Jesus Jesus that's right everybody that that was Paul's group saw the angel he was Paul you see what I'm saying it it doesn't mean that there weren't others saved but it means that there's a select group that was able to identify the voice of their age able to identify the angel of their age and those who believe Jesus Christ says believe on him who God has sent and that's what we do we know God sent the prophet of God yes sir like God sent Jeremiah and all the other prophets but just as they did him they did us the same way and so ending this of Jeremiah Jeremiah is just a a shadow of what's going to happen because God destroyed everything tore Jerusalem down tore Jerusalem up and God is not going to just tear Jerusalem up God going to tear up the whole world there going to be a new Earth a new heaven right and the New Jerusalem is built in heaven it comes down from heaven and and brother bandam said that God is now building the New Jerusalem so when all the burning is all over we won't have to worry about no Liars no thiefs no gamblers we won't have to worry about the children of Darkness we won't have to worry about Temptation we can't even imagine it am but that's the word and I loved Jeremiah even though I kind of breeed through it because it was so so much we would have been here for mons maybe a year but my point is uh I was hoping that the people who knew we were reading Jeremiah would read Jeremiah that was the inspiration to get people to read Jeremiah so now I'm not going to tell you what we're next teaching on I'm just contemplating on some things but by the grace of God I hope that we can it will be between Hebrew and Romans maybe Ephesians so that's where we'll be I think we need to go down I won't have to jump with those books because they're not that long and we could we could do that in a shorter period of time so by the grace of God we thank you for your coming and we're five minutes over but we appreciate it let's have stand and have a word of Prayer father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves I thank you for the little lesson Lord God tonight to know Lord that it's a parallel it's what what's happening now we see the Judgment of the lord we see the Christian going far backwards Lord I mean your Prophet even said that he saw her marching naked to the tune of rock and roll and God help us Lord God to to stay straight in that straight and narrow way and if we out of line if we're out of the footstep please give us Grace to get back in line help us now in your name Jesus Christ as we see that combine coming we see it we can hear it we know it's there and we know God that it's coming and Lord we pray that you would when you do all your Gathering that we'll be gathered oh God into the to to with the weat Lord and not with the tears help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
