hallelujah as we stand in honor of the word we're glad to have everybody here tonight I don't know about you but I'm happy in the Lord Jesus Christ God is so good Hallelujah there are not no words to express my gratitude on last Sunday we spoke the message the message now and basically we were trying to show you the grace of God God has given us none of us deserve his goodness we thank him for his goodness amen amen amen let's go to Hebrews please wherefore when he comes into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou what if not but a body has thou prepared me sacrifices amen hallelujah amen we'd like to entitle this part of the message the temple of God Amen let us pray you know father God we thank you this evening so good to us you are better and have been better to immunity than we have been to ourselves not expressed Lord perfect our gratitude bless this word Sanctified to our hearts is a pleasure or any worldly pleasure but we come to hear from you the Living Word Lord behind the veil yeah in the name of the Lord amen amen it was a song man amen I like to say tonight that often time we failed who we really are the difference because of the pool of the world because of its influences of course this is in fiance we sometimes forget in my time with the Lord last week the Lord showed me I had forgotten one thing that mattered really matter important would change my life when God began to show me the love that he had for me it has been overwhelming it is something do I need this thank you when you really see the love of God as I expressed uh Sunday in a small portion how that God so loved us come on June now I'm not talking about those who want to pretend to be Christians but I'm talking to Christians uh you know the prophet of God taught us there are three kinds of Believers the believer the make-believer and the unbeliever uh but you need to know who you are and a True Believer says Amen to the word hallelujah the True Believer comes to understand who he is and when it comes to the love of God I I think about his goodness I think about all that he has done you know it's always good to talk about God to other Christians because sometimes other Christians can say things that could really bless your soul I was talking with a precious brother and we were talking about the Seal of God and he was saying you know it was amazing how in the olden days uh once the king put his seal on something the law in itself could not be changed well you know I had heard that I have preached that but there was something that I left out because brother Branham says that we the bride do some silly before the foundation of the world and in the King's day no matter what arrives he could not even change his own laws so those of us who have the Seal of God God cannot change his laws right and this is the reason why brother Branham teaches us that the true bride of Christ is Justified as though she's never sinned in the first place we are about our father's businesses amen we know that God speaks [Applause] that has been the problems with many people they're two corners but when you come to church you're not coming to see flesh even Peter said we don't know Jesus after the flesh anymore we know him after the spirit it doesn't matter what position they may have going to church when you discern the spirit you see of God or not Hallelujah and we Fellowship in the spirit so understand when you become a Christian you're no longer a fleshly man you are a spiritual man that you've never seen William Bradley on the inside Hallelujah is that right the real you is on the inside Hallelujah that's why I read that scripture a body thou hath prepared um Hallelujah because when the carnal man uh when he saw Jesus he saw a Man from Nazareth and and that's the scripture says can any good thing come from Nazareth but what they didn't understand he didn't come from Nazareth he came from God so anyway let's move on a body that I have prepared and so understand the whole purpose of God was to multiply himself God become man and so God became man in Jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily in here you might say well that was Jesus well let's come to our day we had a man by the name of William Bradley is that right and God brought him to a maturity in other words the divine nature dwells in that man and he God used him as a wave sheep y'all know what I'm talking about to show that there were others to come now I don't know about but I'm one of them Hallelujah and he came to make us see that this world in itself is just fertilizer I wanted to say the other word but it's just manure amazes and you and I have been planted in this manure don't don't sit there to bring forth the best we could bring forth and this is why God shows us to be planted in the worst age ever Hallelujah in other words the more potent the manure the the foreign and I can't tell you the paragraph somehow I don't have that on there but here he says you don't know Christ by Hallelujah you don't know Christ by dancing in the spirit that's an attribute you don't know Christ by knowing him he said excuse me you know Christ by knowing him as a person let's come into your heart in the form of the Holy Ghost and taken your sins away and planted in a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ did you hear that now he said an undying faith not in yourself Hallelujah but in a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ but find a new book to change from the creature that you once won he said that's how you know him Hallelujah he said then you dance in the spirit I love you don't see on this then you can clap your hair or whatever emotion that the Lord put upon you know that's afterwards but you can have that without having him and you know it is what kind of life it makes you live [Music] you have the believer and how do we tell the difference between the trees Hallelujah am I too loud oh too fast okay my wife be looking out for Frank he says uh it makes you live family listen what the word says here by the love and the faith that's in your heart to him and until you can see the love of God for you you'll never be able to give the love of God to others y'all better hear what I'm saying because he loved you he loved me unconditionally what are you talking about see that's what Abraham coming it is but the True Blood of Christ does not take it for granted she doesn't live to be saved she lives because she is saying hallelujah y'all understand me because listen if you're trying to escape Hell by becoming a Christian you're not a Christian yet oh yeah man that's the truth see because you have the wrong motive you have the wrong objectives Hallelujah you gotta love God would it be a major the first commandment is what love the Lord thy God with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul it's about loving God if you love me he said you will keep my Commandments it's not what I'm scared to go to hell Hallelujah and if you're Abraham's child you have Abraham's faith for that's what make him a servant of Christ Hallelujah is that all right now one thing I love about this word because it corrects us and a lot of times people don't like corrections but I come to the word for Corrections God to tell me what I'm doing wrong y'all hear what I'm saying I tell people I don't want no trouble at the river is coming down not because I fear him but because I love him amen Hallelujah coming from the message his unfailing Word of Promise paragraph 57. the word always correct the error and if you people could only see it today the word corrects the error the whole thing is becoming an error but God's word is what is right he said Heaven and Earth will pass away we shall not passion you know why we fail God at times he is God Amen he's the only potentate only Authority rules [Music] is that right like I said the other day I said even the devil has to ask for permission Hallelujah is that right even when the devil wanted those demons wanted to go into into those pigs they had to ask for from permission when Lucifer or Satan walk the heavens and God was there he had to ask for permission Hallelujah to go down and temp job and God no knew that job was a True Believer he knew he was God hallelujah see that's when God brings a test when he know that you know that he is God hallelujah because when you know that he is God you stand on his words amen you think about Paul when that angel said don't jump out of this boat in order for you to remain safe you got to stay on the ship can you imagine and you saw a little probably had little life jackets or something you know something to help him out but if you if you get off of this boat why because I'm on it and whatever God is safety yeah Hallelujah what about the Hebrew boys and they knew they couldn't afford to bow down to nothing else when you are afflicted with sickness yes the devil had to go to God anytime you act against the the promise of God you are now an unbelievable when you come up for prayer he said God will allow the anointing to fall his presence and then afterwards he will allow the devil to make you sicker Hallelujah but what do you believe if you say oh I'm getting sicker at that moment you are a non-believer [Music] hello [Music] that's nonsense it's nonsense when you delivered you're going to be tempted that's why the Bible says you're not to Temptation Hallelujah Jesus was tempted but he didn't yield Hallelujah [Music] the damn shame you ain't delivered because you got the battles in your mind the devil is alive won't forget it I don't care how much holios you got the flesh never forgets and that devil will come and try to deceived to make you disbelieve the word so he can hold you in captivity Hallelujah but if you're true see you don't give up you're coming again Hallelujah is that right Hallelujah because one thing of a true seed run from the battles oh my what are you saying see when you realize you're the temple you understand God ain't just in heaven but God is in you Hallelujah David recognized that God was with him Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying if that's what he told Brother Branham if you want the people to believe what things become possible y'all hear what I'm saying God In the Flesh now that he's gone God wants to occupy your flesh he wants you as the temple of God hallelujah is that right and the word let me finish this quote please and the word that is prophesied for this day correctly era of this the day he said you understand the word itself corrects the people today [Music] that's the message Hallelujah oh see that's an error and the word comes back who directs that error by identifying itself the hour and the time of the hour now we know those things are true in other words if you had been in the Pentecostal age all of that steel is okay we have come up higher what God wants to see tonight he wants to see amateur Gods he wants to see Messiah obviously not bad just words we need the mechanics and the Dynamics Hallelujah we'll pass the intellectual Revival he wants to talk through your eyes he wants to walk through your eyes he wants to do everything he can through you and by you Hallelujah it's not on your own accord Jesus said I can't do nothing unless I see the father show me I'm one because it's the number you see so everything is being led by the spirit of God but if you don't have the spirit of God you can't be led by this time not in the proper way see man is designed even in the his makeup and I know we know this really Express this to you when God designs the temple on Earth he was actually designing that Temple according to the way man is made Hallelujah in other words the four living creatures Hallelujah amen God at the throne room is that right Hallelujah and we have the heart that actually have four chambers but we didn't know where the throne room was until brother Branham that even the science is safe there's a place in your heart by the size of a pinhead yeah where there are no blood vessels and the problem God says that's where God dwells Hallelujah so when we say fill me up Lord God need to do is feel you they say we're going to be the greatest of all he Powers [Music] is that right is that right because really the scripture says we have the mind of Christ but until you believe that you gotta see that the mind of Christ is already in you [Music] that demon gonna rule them right some of y'all may have not seen it but even in the coldness of the winter here in Iowa Iowa you'll find people on the outside but smoking a cigarette they'll have no control and all I can think about the devil can't control a man like that what about the Living God hey that's what God wants this is good dreams he wants to control us Paul said I'm a prisoner of Christ I want to be a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ let me go on so we got the four living creatures the heart has four chambers and in the midst of those four chambers it's a space where there are no blood vessels brother Adam said that this was a throne room Hallelujah that's where God dwells then you have the 24 elders and then you got those 24 ribs that protects us the heart and the 24 Elders are 24 tribes the 12 tribes excuse me of Israel what did they do they protected hallelujah what is the 12 apostles do they get they protect the Ark of the Covenant the real one Jesus Christ so much so we call it the apostolic Doctrine Hallelujah is that right yeah so the 12 24 ribs [Music] where God take that anger ignorance the laws of denominationalism we depended on his grace [Music] she was not beating the company to see the go to see the king everybody kill you but as amen [Music] you know the keys Hallelujah amen see but we forget we forget I'll never leave you um because we often go by our feelings Faith call those things [Applause] Hallelujah education to our newcomers you're going to have some opposition but know you the king's daughters and sons hallelujah amen I mean David just had a one stone but he used it wasn't nothing yeah when you when you when you ask God for anything believe that he is given to you you can't let circumstances change your mind those are the things that amazes me um [Music] back to the Sons and Daughters of God put things under our feet but you gotta know who's in the house [Music] Hallelujah so we know that brother random said that now we come to the eye age which is the intelligence age which is the intelligence but understand we have the mind of course Adam had the mind of Christ anymore because God had already named them he caught the thought of God name those atoms uh animals according to the thought of God and when you this is why it's so important to pray well of course it was important because in your prayers God will take you somewhere Hallelujah the creation of man was in the image and likeness of God created a spirit man this was the true image of God this man was created as an amateur God he was God of the Earth but there was still a greater God there was God hallelujah amen right so the man in Genesis 1 26. it was his theophany is that right to rule those animals be seen by the natural eyes to move those animals animals the way he won he wanted to so Hallelujah and then God took that man and put him in flesh yeah and he stood like a tree like the prophet said in there will have authority still had rules Adam didn't make a mistake Adam willfully said he was going to do it because he said this um will leave her mother and father to her husband there was no such thing as a mother and father could not have been a mother and father McCain we would have been just sisters and brothers and that's what we'll be after the Fallen that's the way it was supposed to be Hallelujah the very designer man showed what God intent was in the beginning he will he he would Tabernacle in the body God himself Hallelujah had not if Adam had not Fallen we would all come in a different ways but Jesus Christ the second Adam he was a word put everything back in Hallelujah now I'm gonna tell you something brother had definitely a unique gift foreign so you gotta understand what God is doing God is now identifying himself this is where God is bringing us hallelujah amen [Music] [Music] a party and in turn this would give will will birthday if that's not right because when the foolish virgin came to knock on the doors and they knew they couldn't get it and you know what the wise version told him yeah Hallelujah amen and when you knock on the door and here's the door opens the door and invite you here so the open door hello that's why brother Branham says I must lay in the presence don't let it become common to you whatever you do don't let him pause is this okay Hallelujah man so you understand where I'm coming from mature I mean Mark 11 17. you don't have to turn there but when Jesus was rebuking them in the house of God in the synagogue my house should be called The House of Prayer you that was just in Shadow and type supposed to be called the house but we find out that even in this message people get scared to say that let me tell you it ain't the message it's the thieves is that right people have gotten filthy rich [Music] okay that's just the way they are and it's not right people is it bad corrector think about what this message could do if the preachers would get together in such a way we will take care of the Ministries but the commission has never stopped Hallelujah is that right is it right he was brother Branham always on the mission Fields anyway I'm almost done I know you guys this is a Wednesday night give me a five five more minutes there is a new commandment y'all um I'm gonna close on his and I'll finish the wrestling there is a new commandment like I said oh my journey on my trip I'm trying to explain it to you but I just said I saw the love of God in my life in ways I can't even explain I can see before I got saved or knew I was saying constantly wooed me chased after me foreign [Music] a drunk driver just missed me by a few seconds or minutes the stairs in that truck would have hit me just as well I was in a club and I had no food because I was carrying on the whole day but you don't know I drank third that's counting I drank 13 vodka College I know to this day I would say alcohol poisoned all of a sudden death because I was going to die and I was foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah and Save and Satan cannot pluck you out of his head oh Jesus I love the Lord Hallelujah glory to God Dodger Hallelujah that new commandment Saint John 13 jeans because if you seek anything from God seek his Divine love he said a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you come to see me that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples and I'm not talking about this we're talking about unconditional love so that you can love your enemies right or wrong [Applause] amen he did it for me Jesus did it I wish I could remember the words but anyway I can't help but to praise him see because he did it for me people of God those of you who don't know me for one purpose and that is as Paul said a people that love him I know we've got a lot of things in here but if you truly want to move forward [Music] go through [Music] [Music] I don't mind going through it Brothers you are the temple of God Hallelujah longing longing for Jesus [Music] to be foreign [Music] [Music] thank you just to be near here to feel his praise
