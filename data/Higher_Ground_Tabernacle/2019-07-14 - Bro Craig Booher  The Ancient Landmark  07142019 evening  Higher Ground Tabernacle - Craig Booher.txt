TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh hear my humble cry and while another is thou art all holy do not pass me by hey man do you love him tonight amen greetings in the precious name of Lord happy to be in the house of God my heart was warmed by the presence of the Lord this morning and just honored to be here brother Brooks you'd my daddy in the gospel and it ministers to me just being here just being with each and every one and seeing you standing after the years and he that endureth unto the end shall be saved and so we're just happy more than words can express to be a Christian and to be on the winning side and so we need strength from God we're dependent upon God and God is faithful so we get our strength from the word possessing the precious promises of the Scriptures and so tonight my voice is just a bit hoarse I would like to I'm not going to come down to a screeching halt but I would like to teach a little bit and I think it'll bless our hearts and help us as Christians and so my preaching can be or my teaching can be preaching teaching so you know how it is but I do desire the good Lord willing this is what's on my heart so if we could turn in our Bibles tonight to Deuteronomy chapter 19 verse 14 just give me your patience just to uh to labor in the scriptures here just to get get a foundation going here bitter enemy chapter 19 verse 14 and I love the Word of God it's just something I can it never gets old I love the Word of God Deuteronomy chapter 19 verse 14 thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark which they have old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it and he says is a command now not to remove the ancient landmark proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 I don't want a blast nobody but can I get a little more back here proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 one verse remove not the ancient or the everlasting landmark which thy fathers have set now there are several scriptures that are very similar to this but in Deuteronomy he commands them do not move the ancient landmark and that in Proverbs he says remove not the everlasting landmark which your fathers have said so I want to preach tonight on the the ancient landmark let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we love you with all that is in us that's why we come Lord to the house of God we ask you to forgive us of all of our wrongdoings all of our unbelief all of our distractions of life we know Lord that there is mercy with you and grace with you your long-suffering Lord and your mercy is from everlasting to everlasting thank you Lord for such a covenant and a promise thank you Lord for your love to mankind help us Lord in the service we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you you can have your seats here Moses and Deuteronomy was giving instruction to the Joshua generation he was given instinct you for the rich he was giving instruction to the generation of overcomers the Prophet was giving instruction to them when you come into the land he was saying now you're gonna set boundaries and borders these are going to be landmarks to you and so when he sent Joshua into the land Joshua divides the land to the children of Israel and I want you to turn with me to Joshua chapter 18 as we just get moving here Joshua chapter 18 verse 1 and I want to read down through this portion of Scripture Joshua chapter 18 verse 1 and the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the a burn Akal of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them and there they remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which should not receive their inheritance joshua said unto the children of israel how long are you slack to go possess the land which the Lord your God your the Lord God of your father's have given you give out from among you three men for each tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the land to describe it which means to survey it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again unto me and they shall divide it into seven parts Judah shall abide in the coasts on the south and the house of Joseph shall abide on their coasts on the north you shall therefore survey it describe it survey it the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that I may cast lots for you before the Lord your God but the Levites shall have no part among you for your priesthood of the Lord I'm sorry for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance and GAD and Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh shall receive their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them and the men arose and went went away and Joshua charged them and they they went to describe or survey the land saying go walk through the land and describe it or survey it and come again unto me that I may cast Lots before the Lord in Shiloh and the men went and passed through the land and surveyed it by cities into seven parts in a book and came again to Joshua to the hosts of Shiloh and Joshua cast Lots before them in Shiloh before the Lord and their Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their division so after they surveyed the land they came before the Joshua Joshua now goes before the Ark of the Covenant which was in Shiloh and he cast lots and when he cast these Lots this was said the borders of the inheritance of Israel and God had set its boundaries God had set its parameters God had set its limitations and their inheritance was within these boundaries outside of these boundaries there is no inheritance inside these boundaries they could be blessed and God would only bless Israel in that Promised Land within the perimeters that God had set then they could be blessed their families would be blessed their lives would be blessed brother Branham said thus saith the Lord God will never bless us until we come within the boundaries of our blessing which is the Word of God that is our promised land then he said you will not sell the land forever because the land is mine I give it to you by the grace of God and so Benjamin had his had his portion of inheritance and God set the boundaries of that inheritance you'll find that the tribes of Israel every one of them had a portion that God had given them now notice this God there were certain landmarks that marked the boundaries of each of the tribes of Israel and there was forests there was mountains there was rivers there was gorgeous there were natural landmarks ever sees there was lakes and these marked natural landmarks that naturally set boundaries for the inheritance of the children of Israel but then there were man-made boundaries such as stone fences such as rocks and heaps of stones and stakes these were property lines and these these were landmarks and a landmark is is to set the territory or the limits or the boundaries that a territory might be preserved so the only way that they would know their inheritance is to know the boundaries or the land ARC's that God had set up for them and so notice now the landmark if if it was contended if brother Brooks had a portion and I had a portion and I I can test his portion and say it's mine and he says it's his it would be the landmark that would stand as a witness of whose land it was because the landmark is not going to change the landmark is a territorial absolute meaning that it will always be there in all it will never change can you say men that's why the ancient landmarks they were unchanging landmarks it had wonderful so what it would do was it would give you assurance of your position you would know by the landmark whether you're in the land or out of the land on gods territory or on the devil's territory you would know by the landmark of where you stood in the eyesight of God can you say men and geographically speaking you could know your position you could know whether you're in the wilderness or whether you're in the promised land I'm ready to meet Christ er I'm not ready to meet Christ I'm a child of God or I'm not a child of God so one could actually orient oneself as well because the landmark is a reference point if seamen would travel the coast they would look for high mountain peaks and that would be a landmark so they could orient themselves and know where they were can you say Amen and they can look for navigation at high point sir lighthouses or you know different things like that so you can align with your position and you can know I'm going in a safe direction it's just like the North Star but the random set out on the Seas if you can't see the stars you might get lost on a raging sea but if the cards move back and you can see the North Star you can know where you are and where you need to go so it works as a compass it works is as something to if you're disoriented you can did a reference point and come back to your god-given position you know brother Branham said that being lost is a terrible condition he said that lost men he had encountered men that had got lost in the woods he said they take on a fever and he said they would actually lose their minds he'd saw a young man that was lost for three days he went completely out of his mind in panic and when they saw him he didn't even recognize his own brother and he was clone at him like an animal he said it was the most pitiful thing that he ever saw and he said when a man is lost from God he is in that same state he said he don't know where he's at he's bewildered he's confused he's absolutely lost his loss can be and he said a church when they leave the Bible can be lost like that disorient means to lose your sense of direction so outside of the borders of God's word we are absolutely lost there's no salvation outside of God's borders and many Christians are spiritually disoriented they don't know they're standing they don't know their position they don't know who they are in Christ brother Adam talked about this in spiritual amnesia he said you know there were boys had fought in the early wars before the modern you know the modern organization of armies and so forth and he said that men would get shell-shocked from the battle you've heard the story and he said because people he'll bombs are going off people were losing arms they were losing their buddies next to them and most of them are you know just 18 19 children and so they go into shell shock where they don't know who they are they don't know where they come from they don't know who their family is they don't know where they're going they come into state of amnesia there lost and brother branham said that they would gather family members and have a group of boys who lost their identity they would gather him up and try to call family in and they would look through and and they would claim their loved ones but if they were not claimed and were not been able to identify who they were they would put him on a train and send him to the sanitarium and brother Branham said that these men were going down the train track and it was time to stop so they can stretch their legs and he said when the soldiers walked out there milling around with a blank look on their face heading to the sanitarium and he said but one young soldier got to looking at a water tower and he said he rubbed his eyes and he just kept looking and there was a guard watching him and he said he rubbed his face and he looked around and he didn't have the blank stare all the sudden he started to look like he was coming to himself and he said he started walking towards a certain path and he said instead of stopping him the guard just followed him and he said he went around the bend through a little woods and up over the hill and he said right there was a cabin and there was an old man on the cabin and the old man stands up as the young soldier is walking to the house and he said my son my son I knew you had returned when he saw the landmark it gave him the census it brought him back it oriented him it made gave him a position it brought him back to know who he was and where he was going and brother branham said you Christian soldiers look back to the world of God he said come back to yourselves can you say Amen notice this we look at the ancient landmark your faith has got to have a resting place brother Branham said this church has got to get back to the Pentecostal landmark back to the Word of God again back to the power of God again back to the blood of Jesus that cleanses all sins because Calvary is our landmark you know Jesus thundered it is finished when he hung on the cross and those were his last words it is finished what he accomplished at Calvary the devil can never erase and I really believe that many lack faith in what was really accomplished that day at Calvary he thundered it is finished now when he said it was finished he finished it for us he finished it for the world sin question was settled at Calvary every redemptive blessing that there is goes back to the ancient landmark divine healing came from Calvary healing salvation from Calvary everything Adam lost that day at Calvary did you know that every sinner in the world is saved right now that these are quotes that brother branham said every sinner on the face of the earth that has breath in their young lungs right now is saved every human being on earth is saved right now for the Menem said he died to save the human race he said now if you die not accepting it then you're condemned as a sinner because it's a free gift to all men don't you say am i predestinated or am I not predestinated you're already saved but he predestinate you by foreknowledge knowing whether you'll walk in the ark early walk away from the ark so you make the decision whether you're saved or not every human being was saved at Calvary but if you don't accept this grace you're as lost loss can be Calvary included.you Calvary included me the devil can never change it when he said it is finished he finished it for you he finished it for you he finished it for you he finished it for us that dead Calvary the devil did in your mind am i predestinated or am I not he opened the way how many believe that God so loved the world the Bible says in Titus 2:11 for the grace of God brings salvation that brings salvation has appeared to all men can you say all men that means seed and non seed it's exactly right you said Nancy can serpent seed be saved he died to save them remember Cain he said if you do well I'll reward you if you do what your brother does I will receive you Jesus God was not lying no no no he offered Cain and opportunity and he said in the token that the blood of Abel the justice of Abel it condemned Cain but the blood of Jesus speaketh better than that of Abel he said the blood of Abel could not forgive Cain but the blood of Jesus can and it's crying it cries out forgiveness if he'll accept it by grace are you saved Calvary is an ancient landmark and by Calvary you can know your position in Christ do you believe that how many said lord I want to know where I'm standing you'll look back to Calvary that's the only way you'll know your position you'll know who you are but we've got to know the landmarks because God has set these landmarks do you believe that Deuteronomy 27 verse 17 let's turn there Deuteronomy chapter 27 verse 17 I'll try not to hold you long just pay real close attention here we want to give the devil real black eye tonight Deuteronomy 27 so how can Satan reverse what Jesus accomplished at Calvary there's no reason why anybody should be lost it's their own unbelief it's all on us not on God he did everything he could 27:17 curse it is he that removes his neighbor's landmark and all the people shall say Amen when men removed the boundaries that God have sent in the Word of God he is cursed if an angel preach anything else than what Paul preached his curse churches are cursed when they add their Creed's and take away the word of the Lord and many our churches have tried to remove the landmarks to enlarge their borders to enlarge the borders of membership so they compromise the Word of God to try to enlarge their popularity and they compromise the Word of God they've tried to remove scriptures and tried to change it and so forth but they come under the curse of God when they do it the Antichrist tried to remove the ancient landmarks back in the Ephesus age and down through the Dark Ages and down through the ages 40,000 denominations were established because every one of them redefined God's boundaries every one of them every one of them had a definition of the boundaries and contested the boundaries of God's Word you love the Lord and the church has become a wilderness of dark false doctrine it has become a wilderness where people are going from church to church wandering it is lost can be because they have removed the ancient landmark of grace they have made it legalism they have said if you come to our church or if you do this and they put the people under bondage because they had removed the truth of grace from the church men have tried to rule God's church and instead of God and Satan knows if he can remove the landmark then the church is disoriented they're bewildered they're confused you know brother Branham said this man said this I want you to listen very closely he said brother Branham I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord brother Branham I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place tell me if I can be restored again listen to the condition this man is disoriented this man is in a bad shape listen to brother branham's responds you have not sinned friend so far in God that you can't be restored if you send so far that you could not be restored you would not to want to be restored but as long as there something dealing in your heart you're in the line of restoration guilty of the least his guilty of the whole he said I have sinned every day and do things I don't want to do and he said sister will you lay hands on me and free me dear sister dear brother I'd lay hands on you but it would never free you what would free you is to understand you are already free you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free don't be entangled again in the yoke of bondage Christ set you free I could do that but it would not set you free until you accept what God has done just say Lord by faith I believe it I confess my yNN's and he said there you get the freedom and justification I've sinned I've done wrong I've fallen I'm dead wrong is there a chance for me to be whole again absolutely the minutes you desire it it shows God dropped the lifeline down to pick you up just rise up on the lifeline of faith and prayer and move right on up with the Eagles flop it away see brother Branham did not show a vision he pointed him back to Calvary back to the Word of God where Jesus said it is finished [Music] deliverance can only be found within the borders of the promised land can you say man you know one time you know brother Branham told the story of how he got he took me to on her on their honeymoon yeah thank you I think up towards to New Hampshire and and they had to stay in a lean-to for the night until the next morning when the man would open up the kademan you know and brother branham's a hero any man that can get his wife to go on a hunting trip that is phenomenal so we all just sit back and admire it say God just blessed to serve it so anyway brother Branham leaves me to meet it knows nothing about the woods he leaves her there with little Billy Paul he said I'll be back by 12:00 moon and he took off into his playground great Tall Timbers running through the woods in the mountains free from everything he's going through he's watching for animals and he's hunting and he was born to do this something about being free we were meant to be free God would love if we would come into church like that just come in I was made to be here explore God's promises enjoy God's promises just love God's promises walk the promised land so he's out hunting enjoying himself like a kid on a playground and he sees a big deer and he said that's what we need to shot it he hung it out and he said all the sudden the trees the winds begin to shift it at circuits and the trees begin to move snow started to come in and fog begin to settle brother Branham said oh I better get back to meet her he said it's getting late so he takes off then about a half hour something looks strange and he sees the deer that was hung in confidence because he was a woodsman he said I must have gotten mixed around he took off again and all of a sudden he's a little concerned because he comes right back around again now he's feeling a little bewildered and he said alright bill okay I just wasn't paying attention so he tried it a third time in the third time he got real sober because he said I know I'm on the deathlok the indians called it the death walk when a person gets a loss they go in circles and and we know we've seen it many times through the years drugs around and around and around sin around and around and around just like Sampson around and around and around and he said I realized that he said so I tried to bluff it he said it's getting late and he starts worrying about meda and he thinks she's gonna go frantic if an animal screams it's cold they'll freeze she's probably once worried to death and the devil started getting in his mind and he said come on bill you're not lost you're too good to be lost come on get ahold of yourself he said I was only bluffing we don't want to come up to the rapture bluffing we got to make sure that we know our position and he said he heard a voice way off I'm an ever-present help in the time of trouble you know we get so frantic about our problems and our mistakes but it's those times God wants to reveal himself and show himself strong and I love this because brother Branham was so real that he just like you and I would I'm hearing things as much as he talked to the angel as much as he experienced the supernatural he said oh I must be hearing things and he said come on they'll get next to yourself and that he hears I'm an ever-present help in the time of trouble and then he said he realized it was him and he said Lord forgive me took off his hat said Lord I'm sorry I'm his lost his loss can be and I'm sorry this proud creature I can't do nothing myself forgive me Lord if you'll get let me get back to my wife and babies don't let them die because of me let me get back to him Lord I'm in trouble in Jesus name Amen he said now he was looking for hurricane Mountain and he couldn't find it and he said now because of the fall get set in he said I could find no sign to get oriented and so hurricane Mountain was the landmark that would have give him his orientation so he said now I believe this is the way to hurricane Mountain and I'm gonna walk there just as speedline as I can and he said I started to walk and a hand went like this and he said when I turned God put a hole through the fog and there was hurricane Mountain he said I was walking in the opposite direction portes Canada and he said when he did it I said thank you Lord and it closed back up and he said now it was getting dark but he already got his bearings and he said as long as I walked that way he said I know that I'll be fine and he said it was freezing and snow and sleet was coming in and he knew he put a line up that spring it was a telephone line down to the cabin he said now I've got to hold my hands up in order to detach head line and he said so he was walking it was five miles it was dark and he said the winds was blowing his hands were freezing he had pulled him down and he said he would just keep holding him up but whatever he did he let nothing get him off course when you catch a vision of Calvary don't let nothin take you off course raise your hands and walk towards Calvary he would fall and scrape his knees and animals would jump up in front of him and he said god help your servant give mercy to your servant and he walked like that for five miles he said he would grab something his heart would powder but it was just a branch he would keep walking and just keep walking and he said finally he felt the line and he said when he grabbed the line he knew Oh God right at the end of this line is everything that I hold dear in life brother Branham said when we strike the line of the Holy Ghost you know if you don't let go just hold on God justified you he the justifies will glorify and right at the end of this line when we break into that dimension you'll see shining angel our precious brother and they'll embrace and love and you will enter into immortality right at the end of this line just a breath away just a dimension away it's right there brother Branham said he was ten feet away from it glory God shows him his bearings by a landmark he had to walk to the darkness we're gonna have trials but as long as you keep your course you will never fail how wonderful do you love the Lord God moved back the fog and so is God did it in this age after 2,000 years of dark ages he has moved back the fog and we have seen Calvary for what it means we have seen the Word of God for what it means we've seen Pentecost for what it means it may look like the Prophet went off the scene and it got dark again we have found our course just keep marching keep walking keep fighting keep wrestling because we have got our bearings in this age when a Christian gets outside the boundaries of the word he is lost remember Cain went out of the presence of the Lord and the Bible said he dwelt in the Land of Nod which meant wandering and that's what he became a wander because he left the word he became a wander because he left the presence of God that's like a lot of bewildered Christians they leave the word of God and they find themselves in a terrible situation I want to give you another example it's incredible and I really want to take my time and I hope that God will write his word upon your hearts as I as I read these examples here's a woman in questions and answers 1964 and I want you to hear this as she's coming to brother Branham for help she said brother Branham what shall we do something has settled over me and I cannot break through last fall I dreamed I was lost in whites and it was getting dark I can't find my way and this dream has stayed with me since last fall and I'm groping in darkness my son Irvin and his wife were included in my dream and now they also are in darkness we are desperate we are in desperation I believe God will show you what is in our hearts if we're wrong and sinning tell us we want to be right isn't that a horrible situation to be in listen to brother branham's responds now this is brother Branham I don't know the lady but I feel if you're here lady that here is your trouble you have let something happen to you that made you nervous being in White Sands represent represents purity and righteousness you're just letting the devil put one over on you your dream proves that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of the family nervous stop doing it and claim your god-given rights your dream proves by the interpretation that you're in white sand everything is all right you're only nervous now try each one of you children to help your mama your papa try to help your children don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you you are Christians born of the Spirit of God you're the salt of the earth there Benny praise if there be any any virtue think on these things don't you think about the wrong thing now now notice brother Branham when he's dealing with this of course having a gift he saw the dream he said oh no no you're in wipes and nothing is wrong how many Christians in message churches are suffering nervous conditions when there's nothing wrong see the devil can play mind games if you will leave the word now she went out of the word to believe the devil's lie where the venom called her back to the boundaries of the word the ancient landmark and it set her free see how powerful the word is I want to give you another one brother Branham said this now that he said a man came to me not long ago said he had an old junk truck he said I was a rich man two years ago but I sold my car lot and I gave everything I had to ministers he said I went to a Billy Graham revival he said I wanted to find peace in my soul he said you know his wife his wife a couple years back went to a Pentecostal church and got the spirits and he said that he said that he was happy for her and she said why don't you come and he said I'm not the religious type but I'll supply for you and I'll give you money to give to your church he said I was never a church-going man and he said but then he said one day he said I sold are and he said I walked into the office and I thought did I give those keys to the woman that I sold the car to and he's I reached in the pocket of my coat and I pulled out a paper where will you spend eternity and he said I looked at that he said I put it down he said and all sudden something was happening he said I picked it up where would you spend eternity it got something was happening on the inside he said it bothered him so bad he called a worker and said take it the rest of them I'm going home he's and it's hard he said I've got to settle this where will I spend eternity he was about 40 or so he said so I I went home and I prayed he said so I went to a Billy Graham meeting and he said when I went to the milling Graham meeting he said now every one of you that want to receive Christ he said why don't you raise your hands up and he said and accept him and he told me it was over he said but it wasn't over and he said so I went to the Methodists and the Free Methodist said if you get sanctified enough to shout then it all be over and he said I got sanctified enough to shout and he said but it wasn't over and he said so I went to the Pentecostals and he said and they told me if I would speak in tongues and he said real faithful men went into the room and stayed with me until I spoke in tongues he said but it didn't settle it in my heart he said brother Branham I'm I'm in a terrible place he said now he said I went to the full gospel businessman I think it was or the voice of healing or something in error in Louisiana and he said they told me that I had crossed the line and that the only one that could help me was you that you're a prophet of God and he said so I come because I'm in a terrible place and I want to know you know what what should i do from here and and so where the random takes this man and he tells him now those people pointed you he said they were right and they were wrong he said every one of them Billy Graham the Methodists and the Pentecostals pointed you to the attributes of Christ he said but to receive Christ is to receive the person of the Lord Jesus and brother Branham said and you have already done that when you were going down the road hating religion knowing no religion at all you saw that sign and something turned you around and in two years you've sought and you've hunted I said what is conversion mean it means to turn around you were one time hating God hating religion and ignoring it but all the sudden at your desk you got to hunting God and seeking God you were converted he threw his arms around me and started weeping said brother Branham I've had it the whole time I said exactly right he said you don't need a prophet the word settles your question oh the Lord settles your question why did he point to the Lord it is the ancient landmark it was good for brother Branham it is good for us to know our position in Christ he takes the man to his experience that others devalued but brother Branham said right there's where God dealt with you that ought to make you shout we complicated in this day we don't bring them to a tongue or to a shout but we've got indoctrinate him real good in order for them to be a real believer what a shame let me ask you was the thirty thousand Natives in Durban South African doctrine aided or were they saved and filled with the Holy Ghost God don't need our help God does the saving salvation is of the Lord we complicate these things and then we undervalue what God has done in our lives how many has he turned around here can I give you another one this come in 1963 does God call a man to judgment without first warning him he says build-out asked me not long ago he said I'm getting old 91 years old do you think I'm ready to die do you think that I'm saved brother branham said Mr Dow have you ever had went to a doctor for a physical checkup he said yes sir he said now the doctor he's got a medical book and he said he will he will test you by that medical book and he said he'll take his stethoscope and he'll check your heart you check your blood pressure you get a urine sample and he said he'll look you over but when that doctor diagnoses you he bases his diagnosis off the medical book and he said now let's give you a soul examination and God has a medical book and this is what brother random quotes to him he quotes to him st. John 5:24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has passed from death unto life he said now here means to receive he said he said what about it he said that means to hear his word you have passed from death unto life he said now how's your heart beating bill now said I believe it I've heard it I've received it he said now let's see what the doctor says you have passed from death unto life and he said I'm not the same man anymore he said I I'm not what I used to be brother Branham said no he said I used to care about going the other way but now my heart burdens day and night to get closer every word I believe it brother Branham said your heart is beating pretty good because you have had a conversion this is amazing here the seals are opened and brother Branham didn't in doctor name said well do you understand the opening of the word do you understand that the mighty angel and God has restored everything and that you know invite me that that day at Calvary and how he came up announced the word and the word only and do you understand the horizontal rainbow the third pole and the fish and the tabernac do you understand it you understand what the seven thunders are the seven seals the seven trumpets do you understand the revelations of God that's what it has become substitutes Paul said though I know all mysteries if I have not love it profits me nothing it's not about a head conversion it's about a heart conversion if I have not love it profits me nothing we need a change of the heart it's amazing that what we have in our life is the work of the Lord how many would devalue it how the devil would like to disorient you off the word to make you feel that you're not in you know by the grace of God I travel quite extensively and I find people don't know where they stand in Christ brother Branham said now desperations 1963 now there's no certain evidence isn't this interesting because we have received the mystery of everything the original sin the true truth of the Godhead the truth of the blood predestination we could walk through and show who Melchizedek is we could go down and even all the way down to Paul what his infirmity was he had an infirmity in his eyes and we could go we have the answer to it all but isn't it interesting with all of the answers even the dimensions of the city and the shape of the city that with all of the answers and the mysteries that yet the new birth is still a mystery isn't this interesting and it's not a coincidence God didn't forget about it and revealing all the mysteries he did not forget about it he's doing something here God is concealing something here because the new birth is a revelation brother Branham said now there's no certain evidence now look what you were and now look at what you are [Music] that's how you know what was you before the token was applied now what are you after it is applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after he said then you'll know whether the token is applied or not and the other things will automatically go with it what about it brother chapels what was you before you came to Christ what was you before you came to Christ what was your desires but there was a change that's not psychology because it's deeper than that where does that place you sister Angie where does that place you brother rich what was you before you came into this glorious life that God called you out of darkness brother Keith what about it what about what has God done what what is this miracle that we have experienced and if we could tell our dark closets we know we know where we were we know what we done and we know the path that we was on but God and His grace turned us around we got oriented we saw the ancient landmark and we begin to walk towards glory don't you love the Lord brother branham said now Jesus relied upon what he was he said search the Scriptures for in them you think ever eternal life and they testify of me so he knew that the Scriptures testified of him and he knew who he was because the scripture said who he was and brother Branham said if he knew who he was can't we know who we are we are believers I am a believer I'm a child of God I'm a son of God can't we rely upon it what he has made us he hath made us kings and priests Canaan is where they possess their rights the opening of the seals was to bring us into Canaan though Canaan boundaries and that was the place that they possess their god-given rights can you say men every one of us must claim our promises that we have been given God just don't give it to us we must claim it let's claim one I will never leave thee nor forsake thee I am with you always say always I am with you always though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me I will come to you I will comfort you I will be with you lo even unto the end of the world but you've got to claim that you've got to claim your healing you've got to claim your peace you've got to claim your joy you've got to claim it we're walking in the promised land and we're safe within the borders of salvation how wonderful you know Satan noise targets the Holy Ghost because he don't want you to know where you stand your voice if he can put a question there that's about as good as he wants you say well brother Craig I prayed at the altar and I got peace and you lost it the next day you say well I wear dresses and so do Muslims you can't put you can't put your salvation on those things you say I lived a life and you know and brother Branham said you can't you can't judge it on the fruits of the spirit I came to the altar then you came back next year you can't put you know that either well I had a certain sensation you're up one day and down the next is human emotion you know you cannot base it on anything outside the borders of the scriptures but you if you stay within the borders of the scriptures you're safe because God saved you and God said so that God loves you because God said so and that you are going to Eternity because God said so then you have position whether your me or your sad God said so whether you're blessed or in a trial God said so that's all that matters God said so God loves we no greater honor to God then when we take him at his word God said so notice this now where the random said now he was talking to brother lavell he said he's quite a theologian we were talking about the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost he said this and broken sisters 1965 he said now what do you think about the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost do you think it's speaking in tongues where the RAM said no I don't see it that way and brother Laval said neither do I he said what do you think that it is brother madam said the best that I think it could be would be love and he said that sounded pretty good he said so I just accepted that it was love he said but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out he said that the evidence of the Spirit was those who could receive the word not believe the word but receive the word and when he told me mail he said that scriptural because when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things to you that I have taught and show you things to come he said there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he's never told me anything wrong yet it is the evidence that the Holy Ghost are those that can believe the word and receive the word so there's the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost according to Jesus himself hallelujah so when brother Branham when we wanted to know where we stood with all the ghosts he brought us to the word evidence he brought us back to the scriptures that we could believe every word that we could receive every word and if you really receive it then you live it and if you don't live it you make it right and you you get right can you say Amen brother Branham said that at the opening of the seals the true evidence of the Holy Ghost was revealed under the opening of the word he brought it right back to the ancient landmark he said it has been the evidence since Paul it is always in every age been the evidence and now God has given us the message which is the word which is the ancient landmark back the ancient what Paul established we judge our baptism but why Paul preached we judge the evidence of the Holy Ghost by what Paul preached we judge our holiness standard by what Paul preached and now you can say I have met God's requirement I have accepted him I have confessed him I have buried him I have received him a spirit look at Joel how the devil tried to move job in his day and as I love I love the prophet of God he goes into places and he pulls out little snippets and draws out great revelations from it so here's I don't know if anyone knows this but here's Jobe and the devil ask permission to buffett him he pounds him and he hits him with boils and he takes his children he takes all of his possessions he turns his wife against him turns his church against him he's sitting there the skies are his brass he's cursing the day that he was born and the devil is trying to move him tell him you're a deceiver you have secret sins you are lost and Jobe was just like you and I he had a mind battles like you and I every one of us know we don't deserve this grace but Joel brother branham said was not looking at him because he said he knew he met God's requirements he was looking at the burnt sacrifice you and I will be up one day and down the next and all over the place but that burnt sacrifice was the Word of God God's requirement whether he had balls he stood sacrifice whether he lost his children he stood on that word whether his wife turned against her he stood on that word he said I can't I don't have answers to give you I have nothing that I can offer all I know is I have met God's requirement and when he believed God's requirement it was imputed to him for righteousness he was justified because he did what God required him to do you and I have no righteousness in ourselves but that righteousness is imputed when we are justified by our faith standing on this burnt sacrifice then your unmovable then then you can't be moved stay right there don't you move an inch don't you love the Lord I want to point you tonight before we're closed I want to point you back to Calvary to the ancient landmark every one of us if we could say where were you saved we will say that day at Calvary every one of us here we all want to point you back to the blood that cleanses us of all sin that blood is just as powerful and just as available as the day it was shed at Calvary I want you to look to Calvary I want you to look to the blood I want you to look at Pentecost where he poured out his spirit back to the original back to the message back to Pentecost back to the name of Jesus Christ back to signs and wonders back to the Holy Ghost back to the beginning back to the ancient landmark back to the power of God back to the resurrection let's go back to the beginning where they had loved one for the other let's go back where old man broke the brand and they fed upon the word daily back to the love of God back to a holy spirit filled Church back to the landmark that's how we know who we are that's how we can face tomorrow glory God has set these boundaries and wall unto the man that adds or takes away for he'll lose his part from the book of life because you're outside the borders of the word how men they say Lord I want to be in the promised land brother Branham said he will only bless you in the promised land the message of the hour thus saith the Lord that put something under your feet tonight don't that just bless your heart let's stand to our feet glory let's pray Heavenly Father God our hearts are moved by your word you Lord put us in such a place that we can know exactly where we stand in Christ I ask
