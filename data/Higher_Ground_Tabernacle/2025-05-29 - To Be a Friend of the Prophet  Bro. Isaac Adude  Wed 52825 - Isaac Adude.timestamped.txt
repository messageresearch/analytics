[34:47] We praise the Lord for his grace and his
[34:51] mercy.
[34:53] Amen. To keep us alive till today. It's
[34:56] a grace of God.
[34:59] Amen. So we thank him for it. Amen.
[35:02] Without taking too much time, let's turn
[35:04] our Bibles to Luke chapter 10.
[35:11] We'll read the verse 16.
[35:17] Luke 10 verse 16.
[35:23] Amen. The Bible says that he that
[35:25] heareth you heareth me, and he that he
[35:29] that despiseth you despiseth me, and he
[35:32] that despiseth me despiseth him that
[35:35] sent
[35:42] me. Amen. Let's turn again to Luke
[35:45] chapter 19. Luke,
[35:48] we read the verse 5 to verse 9.
[35:57] Amen. Luke chapter 19 verse 5 to verse
[36:00] 9.
[36:04] Amen. The Bible says here, "And when
[36:06] Jesus came to the place, he looked up
[36:09] and saw him and said unto him, Zakius,
[36:13] make haste and come down, for today I
[36:16] must abide at thy
[36:18] house." And
[36:29] And he made haste and he came down and
[36:31] received him joyfully.
[36:34] [Music]
[36:37] Amen. Uh if we can jump verse 9 the
[36:41] Bible says here and Jesus said unto him
[36:44] this day is salvation come to this house
[36:47] for as much as he also is a son of
[36:51] Abraham for the son of man is come to
[36:54] seek and to save that which was lost.
[37:05] Amen. Uh let's bow our head.
[37:08] Father God, we thank you Lord
[37:11] for your grace. Lord, we thank you for
[37:12] your mercy.
[37:14] Lord, we thank you, Father, for
[37:15] everything that you have done for us,
[37:17] Lord.
[37:19] Lord, we pray, Father God, that you
[37:21] come, oh Lord, and you explain this word
[37:22] to
[41:32] Amen. And he that despiseth
[41:35] you despiseth me. And he that despiseth
[41:39] me despiseth him that sent
[41:43] me. Amen. So that's why brother Brandham
[41:46] is saying that if you receive a
[41:49] righteous
[41:50] man in the name of a righteous
[41:54] man, you receive the righteous man's
[41:57] reward. Is that right? And if they want
[42:01] to know what a prophet's reward
[42:05] is, amen, is to be a friend of the
[42:10] prophets. That's a reward. He is your
[42:13] friend. like the Shomite woman. Amen. He
[42:17] might come in handy
[42:21] sometimes. Amen. He might come in handy
[42:24] sometimes. Amen. To be a friend of the
[42:27] prophet. Amen. So this doesn't mean that
[42:30] you have to
[42:32] worship. Amen. Or start comparing that
[42:35] prophet with
[42:37] Jesus. Or you have to worship that
[42:40] righteous
[42:41] man. Amen. or to try to compare him with
[42:44] Jesus
[42:46] Christ. Amen. But he said that you have
[42:48] to receive him in
[42:51] equality. Amen. Of what God has sent him
[42:54] to
[42:57] be. Amen. So here in the spoken word,
[43:00] the prophet
[43:01] says that this is the law of God.
[43:06] Amen. He says that I don't know. He said
[43:08] that I don't know whether to say this or
[43:10] not.
[43:13] This is the law of
[43:15] God. God's law is to receive a
[43:19] vindicated
[43:22] servant. Amen. That is the law of
[43:25] God. Amen. And his law is to receive a
[43:29] vindicated
[43:31] servant. Amen. A vindicated
[43:34] servant. Amen. If you read if you read
[43:37] uh I believe the message the
[43:40] token. Amen. When when brother Brandham
[43:43] was explaining why Moses was a
[43:45] vindicated
[43:48] servant. Amen. He says that a vindicated
[43:52] servant. Amen. Has a message from
[43:56] God. Amen. And has the signs from
[44:00] God. Amen. And he is proven by the
[44:03] pillar of fire.
[44:06] Amen. That is a vindicated
[44:09] servant. Amen. So here I
[44:13] continue. He says that let's just prove
[44:15] that a minute. I want to take one of the
[44:19] scriptures here. John
[44:24] 13:20. Amen. And John 13:20
[44:27] says that verily verily I say unto you
[44:31] that he that receives whosoever I send
[44:35] receives
[44:37] me. And he and he that receives
[44:41] whosoever I send receives
[44:45] me. And he that receives me receives him
[44:48] that sent
[44:50] me. Amen. But when you receive the
[44:53] person that God
[44:55] sent, Amen. You're not just you're not
[44:58] receiving the person that's the human
[45:00] flesh. So the the person that is let's
[45:03] say for example brother
[45:07] Brandham. Amen. By by you receiving God
[45:12] himself. Amen. Because he is sent by
[45:16] God. Amen. And if you receive God's
[45:19] servant
[45:22] Amen. That might be your friend, your
[45:25] brother. Amen. You don't receive just
[45:28] your
[45:31] brother. Amen. But you receive God who
[45:34] has sent that
[45:36] person. Amen. And when you receive that
[45:40] person, the prophet says that you
[45:42] receive the reward of that
[45:45] person. Amen. So now let's see what is
[45:48] the reward of the person that is sent by
[45:53] God. Amen. So let's turn to Matthew 10
[45:56] 11 to
[46:00] 14. Amen. Matthew chapter 10 11-14 or we
[46:05] can we can start with verse uh yeah
[46:08] verse 11. The Bible says that and into
[46:11] uh uh and into whatsoever city and town
[46:14] you shall enter.
[46:18] Inquire who in it uh uh who in it is
[46:25] worthy and there abide till you go
[46:30] then. And when you come into an
[46:35] house, salute
[46:37] it. And if the house be
[46:41] worthy, in other words, if that house
[46:44] receives you,
[46:48] let your peace come upon
[46:52] it. But if he be not
[46:56] worthy, let your peace return to
[47:00] you. And whosoever shall not receive
[47:04] you, nor hear your
[47:07] words when you depart out of thy house
[47:10] or city.
[47:13] Shake off the dust of your
[47:16] feet. Cuz verily I say unto you, it
[47:20] shall be more tolerable for the land of
[47:22] Sodom and
[47:26] Gomorrah. Amen. In the day of in the day
[47:28] of judgment than for that
[47:33] city. Amen. Here is Jesus sending his
[47:37] disciples. Amen. To go to knock at every
[47:41] doors. Amen. And when they come to a
[47:44] door to a house, amen, they have to
[47:47] greet. They have to say to say their
[47:48] greetings.
[47:50] Amen. And if they are received,
[47:54] Amen. Jesus ordained them to let their
[47:56] peace with
[47:59] them. Amen. In other words, to bless
[48:02] their
[48:04] house. Amen. But if they did not receive
[48:07] them, they shut the door.
[48:11] Jesus told them to go with their
[48:13] blessings.
[48:16] Amen. That's why it is very important to
[48:19] receive the sons and daughters of God to
[48:21] your
[48:23] house. Amen. That's why fellowship is
[48:25] very
[48:27] important. Amen. When you open your
[48:29] doors to God's
[48:32] children, Amen. In other words, you are
[48:34] inviting blessings to come to your
[48:36] house.
[48:39] Amen. Because when you receive the
[48:41] person that God has
[48:43] sent, Amen, you receive the
[48:47] reward. Amen. Which is to become a
[48:49] friend of that
[48:51] person. Amen. And when you are a friend
[48:53] of of
[48:55] someone, amen, you wouldn't want to see
[48:57] your friend
[48:59] suffer. Amen. You will do everything
[49:02] that you can do to help that friend.
[49:07] Amen. James chapter 2 verse
[49:11] 25. Amen. You here it talks about
[49:16] Rahab. Amen. Rahab opened her doors to
[49:20] the the two
[49:23] spies. Amen. And because she opened her
[49:27] doors, Amen. her family were
[49:29] saved. Amen. Likewise also was not Rahab
[49:33] the harlot justified by
[49:37] works when she had received the
[49:41] messengers and had sent them out another
[49:45] way. Amen. She opened her
[49:48] doors. Amen. And if you read if you read
[49:51] I believe uh the book of Joshua,
[49:54] Amen, you will see that those servants
[49:56] those those servants or
[49:59] messengers they told Rahab that because
[50:01] you have helped
[50:04] us. Amen. Because you have saved our
[50:08] lives. Amen. Now we give you a
[50:11] sign. Amen. That you have to

[58:21] they believe in the
[58:24] prophet. Amen. And they don't believe in
[58:26] the
[58:27] message. Amen. That's why there are so
[58:30] many
[58:31] confusions. Amen. But if you believe the
[58:34] message, Amen. You will see that the
[58:36] message points you to

[58:56] message? What is the reward of receiving
[58:59] the prophet?
[59:02] Amen. The prophet says here is in the
[59:03] message
[59:07] leadership leadership paragraph
[59:10] 123 it says that that's why this the
[59:14] church age
[59:17] The church age that we live in,
[59:20] there is no
[59:22] church, no Methodist, Methodist,
[59:25] Baptist, Baptist, Pentecostal, or
[59:28] anything else can ever put this church

[1:01:04] the thing into a mess and a
[1:01:09] huddle just like they've always been
[1:01:15] and God always sends
[1:01:18] the prophet.
[1:01:20] Amen. So the Bible tells us
[1:01:22] here that the spirit of Elijah,
[1:01:26] the spirit of Elijah will come five
[1:01:28] times.
[1:01:31] Amen. The first time was with Elijah
[1:01:33] himself.
[1:01:36] The second time was with Elisha.
[1:01:39] The third time with with uh was with
[1:01:41] John the Baptist. John the Baptist.
[1:01:43] Amen. The fifth time is uh Malachi 4,
[1:01:46] which is
[1:01:47] brother. Amen. And then uh u um uh the
[1:01:52] the and and then what did I say? The
[1:01:54] first time was with Elijah.
[1:01:58] The second time was with Elijah.
[1:02:01] The third time with John the Baptist
[1:02:04] Baptist. The fourth time was with
[1:02:05] brother
[1:02:06] Brandham. And the fifth time will be
[1:02:08] with the Elijah coming with Moses.
[1:02:12] Amen. And if you read the
[1:02:14] Bible, Amen. You will see that everyone
[1:02:17] that received those people under that
[1:02:23] spirit, Amen. received some type of
[1:02:26] recomp some type of reward.
[1:02:31] Amen. Every time that people have

[1:02:39] houses, Amen. those houses were
[1:02:42] blessed. Amen. Because the Bible never
[1:02:45] lies. Amen. God said that if you receive
[1:02:48] my
[1:02:49] servant, Amen, you have received me.
[1:02:53] Amen. So if we read First Kings 17:8-6,
[1:03:00] Amen. I'm reading this. Amen. So that
[1:03:03] you know that it's not coming from me
[1:03:05] but it's from the Bible.
[1:03:08] Amen. So first Kings chapter uh uh
[1:03:10] chapter 17 verse
[1:03:13] 8-6. Amen. Here this is uh uh the first
[1:03:16] time that
[1:03:18] happened. Amen. The Bible says, "And the
[1:03:20] word of the Lord came unto him,
[1:03:25] saying, "Arise, get to
[1:03:29] Zarapath, which belongth to
[1:03:32] Ziden, and dwell there. Behold, I have
[1:03:35] commanded a wider woman there to sustain
[1:03:41] thee." Amen. I I love the word. I love
[1:03:44] the way God
[1:03:46] does. Amen. He said that I have
[1:03:50] commanded a weed or woman to sustain
[1:03:55] thee. Amen. It's Amen. He has Amen. It's
[1:03:59] in other words. Amen. That woman, Amen.
[1:04:03] was already under the inspiration of
[1:04:06] God.
[1:04:08] Amen. When when Elijah was coming,
[1:04:12] Amen. That woman was already God knew
[1:04:14] that that was supposed to happen because
[1:04:16] it's
[1:04:17] him. Amen. Because it's him who have
[1:04:20] commanded that woman to take care of his
[1:04:24] prophets. Amen. And God decided to
[1:04:26] choose just the most poor like the the
[1:04:29] woman who didn't have anything to take
[1:04:31] care of his prophets.
[1:04:36] Amen. So verse 10, the Bible says, "So
[1:04:37] he arose and went to Zarapath. And when
[1:04:40] he came to the gate of the city, behold,
[1:04:43] the widow woman was there gathering of
[1:04:44] sticks. And he called to her, said,
[1:04:47] "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
[1:04:50] in a vessel that I may drink.
[1:05:04] And as she was going to fetch it, he
[1:05:06] called to her and said, "Bring me, I
[1:05:08] pray, thee, a morsel of bread in thine
[1:05:15] hand." And she said, "As the Lord thy
[1:05:18] God leaveth, I have not a cake, but an
[1:05:22] handful of meal in the barrel, and a
[1:05:25] little oil in a cruise. And behold, I am
[1:05:28] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[1:05:30] and dress it for me and my son that we
[1:05:33] may eat and
[1:05:40] die.
[1:05:47] And now and Elijah said unto her, "Fear
[1:05:51] not. Go and do as I as thou has
[1:05:55] said, but make me thereof a little cake
[1:06:01] first, and bring it unto me, and after
[1:06:05] make for thee, and for thy
[1:06:09] son." Amen. How was it going to
[1:06:12] happen? Amen. This woman just told
[1:06:17] Elijah that I have the last meal that
[1:06:19] I'm about to make for my son and
[1:06:25] I. We eat it and then we die. So now
[1:06:29] Elijah here is telling the same woman
[1:06:30] that go do what you
[1:06:34] said. But before you do it, make one for
[1:06:37] me first. Then you'll go make for you
[1:06:40] and your
[1:06:46] son. Amen. For thus sayith the Lord God
[1:06:50] of Israel,
[1:06:55] the barrel of mid shall not
[1:07:02] waste. crews of oil
[1:07:09] fail until verse
[1:07:11] 14 until the day that the Lord sendeth
[1:07:14] rain upon the earth.
[1:07:19] And she went and did according to the
[1:07:21] saying of Elijah. And she and he and her
[1:07:24] house did eat many
[1:07:31] days. And the barrel of meal wasted not,
[1:07:34] neither did the cruise of oil fail
[1:07:36] according to the word of the Lord which
[1:07:39] he spoke by
[1:07:44] Elijah. Amen. Because she received a
[1:07:47] servant of
[1:07:48] God. Amen. Because she received the word
[1:07:51] of
[1:07:52] God. Amen. Elijah said that thou sayest
[1:07:55] the
[1:07:56] Lord. Amen. When the prophet said that
[1:07:59] when a prophet says thou sayest the
[1:08:00] Lord,
[1:08:04] Amen. It's like Jesus Christ himself
[1:08:06] talking.
[1:08:08] Amen. Because that word will never
[1:08:11] fail. Amen. He says that that's the
[1:08:13] reason why you didn't see Jesus saying
[1:08:15] thus sayeth the
[1:08:17] Lord. Amen. Because he was himself
[1:08:21] talking. Amen. And when a prophet says
[1:08:23] thus sayeth the Lord, Amen. The prophet
[1:08:26] says that he sees a
[1:08:29] vision. Amen. of how God has done that
[1:08:33] thing. Amen. So that's why he can come
[1:08:36] with all
[1:08:38] confidence. Amen. And says the Lord.
[1:08:43] Amen. And when a daith the Lord has been
[1:08:47] spoken that word will never come void
[1:08:49] but will fulfill the reason why it
[1:08:53] was. Amen. And she received a prophet.
[1:08:57] Amen. And she became a friend of a
[1:09:00] prophet. Amen. And the reward of
[1:09:03] becoming a friend of a
[1:09:05] prophet. Amen. Was her
[1:09:07] blessing, her salvation. Amen. She was
[1:09:10] about to
[1:09:11] die. Amen. But because she received a
[1:09:14] prophet and his
[1:09:17] message, she received the salvation of
[1:09:19] her
[1:09:20] life. Amen. The barrel of meal were
[1:09:23] wasted
[1:09:26] not neither the cru of of of of oil
[1:09:30] fail.
[1:09:32] Amen. It became like the experience of
[1:09:34] Jesus with the five bread and the the
[1:09:37] three
[1:09:39] fishes. Amen. A small
[1:09:42] basket. Amen. But because of the
[1:09:44] blessing of the
[1:09:46] Lord, it must keep on refilling itself.
[1:09:52] She did not have a big oil, a big jar of
[1:09:56] oil. But just that little bit of that
[1:09:59] small bottle that she
[1:10:01] had, every time she was pouring it
[1:10:05] down, that bottle was auto refilling
[1:10:08] itself. Amen. The same thing with Jesus
[1:10:11] after blessing the breads and the
[1:10:14] fish. Amen. Every time that people were
[1:10:17] taking
[1:10:18] it, that basket was auto refilling
[1:10:22] itself. Amen. Because she had received a
[1:10:26] prophet. Amen. She became a friend of a
[1:10:30] prophet. Amen. And she received the
[1:10:33] reward. Amen. Of being a friend of the
[1:10:37] prophet. Amen. And we if we if you
[1:10:40] continue in verse uh 17 to 24, we're not
[1:10:42] going to read it. Amen. You will see
[1:10:45] that when her son passed
[1:10:47] away. Amen. Because she received the
[1:10:51] prophet. Amen. Because she welcomed a
[1:10:55] prophet. Amen. That same
[1:10:57] prophet. Amen. Was able to bring
[1:11:00] resurrection to her
[1:11:03] house. Amen. Giving salvation to the
[1:11:06] son.
[1:11:09] Amen. Because she received a
[1:11:11] prophet. in his quality of a prophet.
[1:11:16] Amen. If you turn to uh uh uh uh second
[1:11:20] Kings.
[1:11:22] Amen. Chapter 4 verse 22 to uh to 7.
[1:11:26] Amen. So now we're with
[1:11:28] Elijah. Amen. Elisha received a double
[1:11:31] portion of
[1:11:33] Elijah. Amen. Which means that
[1:11:35] everything that Elijah
[1:11:37] accomplished. Amen. Elisha had to do it
[1:11:41] twice. Amen. So Elijah,
[1:11:44] amen, it was this
[1:11:46] woman. Amen. This
[1:11:48] widow, amen, she received him. Amen. And
[1:11:52] her house was
[1:11:53] blessed. Her son was
[1:11:55] resurrected. Amen. So if you turn to
[1:11:58] second Kings
[1:12:01] 47. Amen. If we start from the beginning
[1:12:04] verse one. Amen. The Bible says that now
[1:12:07] there cried a certain woman and of the
[1:12:10] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[1:12:13] Elisha,
[1:12:17] saying, "Thy servant, my husband, is
[1:12:19] dead,
[1:12:21] and thou knowest that thy servant did
[1:12:23] fear Lord, and the creditor is come to
[1:12:26] take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
[1:12:36] Amen. His her husband was a servant of
[1:12:39] the prophet.
[1:12:42] Amen. Her husband was fearing the Lord.
[1:12:46] Amen. So in other words that in their
[1:12:48] house they welcomed the
[1:12:50] message. Amen. So and Elisha said unto
[1:12:54] her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell
[1:12:58] me, why has thou in the house?
[1:13:03] And she said, "Then handmade has not
[1:13:06] anything in the house,
[1:13:10] save a pot of oil,
[1:13:14] just a little bit of oil." Then he said,
[1:13:20] "Go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy
[1:13:27] neighbors." Amen. Even empty
[1:13:30] vessels, and borrow not a
[1:13:34] few. Amen. And when thou art
[1:13:37] coming, thou shalt shut the door upon
[1:13:40] thee, upon thy
[1:13:44] sons, and shall pour into all those
[1:13:47] vessels.
[1:13:50] And thou shalt set aside that which is
[1:13:55] full. Amen. Because they receive the
[1:13:58] message. Amen. Because their family,
[1:14:01] their
[1:14:02] family, Amen. received the servants of
[1:14:05] God. Amen. They received the fear of the
[1:14:09] Lord. Amen. They received the servant of
[1:14:11] God and his
[1:14:13] message. Amen. When they were in
[1:14:16] trouble. Amen. Her her two sons were
[1:14:20] lost. Amen. Her two sons were about to
[1:14:23] be taken as prisoners to pay her
[1:14:28] debt. Amen. Salvation came to her house.
[1:14:33] Notice Elijah Elisha asked her, "But
[1:14:35] what do you have in your house?"
[1:14:39] Amen. Because God to bless you, God will
[1:14:41] use what you
[1:14:44] have. Amen. That God will use what you
[1:14:47] have. Amen. That's why he asked Moses,
[1:14:50] "Moses, what do you have in your
[1:14:54] hands?" Amen. And God will use that. So
[1:14:58] don't be afraid even if it's a little
[1:15:00] thing.

[1:15:04] in
[1:15:06] it. Amen. So the widow woman only had a
[1:15:10] little bit of
[1:15:12] oil. Amen. By that little bit of oil was
[1:15:15] able to last until the rain
[1:15:19] until the rain
[1:15:21] came. Amen. And this woman also had just
[1:15:25] a pot of
[1:15:26] oil. Amen. But because they were friends
[1:15:30] of the prophet
[1:15:33] Amen. They also receive the reward of
[1:15:35] the
[1:15:36] prophet. Amen. And when the prophet told
[1:15:39] her to go borrow all the empty
[1:15:43] vessels. Amen. And he specifically told
[1:15:45] her not to borrow a
[1:15:48] few. Amen. That's the
[1:15:50] reward. Amen. That's the reward. That's
[1:15:53] why the prophet said that it will come
[1:15:54] in handy
[1:15:57] sometimes. Amen. In your time of need.
[1:16:00] Amen. Because you have received the

[1:16:06] sometime. Amen. Those two
[1:16:09] women they were in troubles. Amen. Their
[1:16:12] lives were

[1:17:11] on the day that Elijah passed to to
[1:17:16] Shanim where was a great
[1:17:19] woman and she constrained him to eat
[1:17:23] bread.
[1:17:25] Amen. In other words, she didn't give
[1:17:27] Elisha or the prophet no other
[1:17:31] options. Amen. The same way God told
[1:17:35] Elijah that I have orained a woman to
[1:17:38] sustain
[1:17:40] this. Amen. Which means that that woman
[1:17:43] did not have any other options but to do
[1:17:45] what God already
[1:17:48] planned. Amen. The same way that Jesus
[1:17:51] told Zakius that I must be to your house
[1:17:54] today. At your house
[1:17:58] today. Amen. So this woman constrained
[1:18:01] him to eat
[1:18:07] bread. So it was so it was that as often

[1:18:27] by. Amen. It was a house that he will go
[1:18:29] always to eat
[1:18:31] bread. Amen. And if you read the
[1:18:33] remaining of the verse of the of the
[1:18:35] chapter. Amen. Because Elisha was going
[1:18:38] there every
[1:18:39] day. Amen. That woman decided to build a

[1:19:16] want? Amen. She said that I don't want
[1:19:19] anything. I'm good. I'm with my husband
[1:19:20] and all
[1:19:23] that. Amen. But because she received a
[1:19:27] prophet in his quality of a
[1:19:30] prophet. Amen. God was able to answer
[1:19:34] her unspoken need.

[1:20:00] old. Amen. Even though she said that she
[1:20:03] is in need of nothing.
[1:20:06] Amen. But because of her actions,
[1:20:09] Amen. God was able to give her what she
[1:20:11] didn't ask for.
[1:20:16] Amen. A son.
[1:20:19] Amen. Verse 32 to 37, we're not going to
[1:20:21] read it. Amen. That son
[1:20:25] died. Amen. But because of that,
[1:20:29] Amen. God was able to send his servant,
[1:20:33] Amen. to resurrect that son.
[1:20:37] Amen. Because they
[1:20:39] received the prophet in his quality of a
[1:20:42] prophet.
[1:20:46] The prophet says here, we read this, but
[1:20:48] we're going to read it
[1:20:50] again. Amen. In question and answer, he
[1:20:52] says that whosoever receive a prophet in
[1:20:54] the name of a prophet receives the
[1:20:56] prophet's
[1:21:00] reward. reward is to be a friend of the
[1:21:05] prophet. Whosoever receives a righteous
[1:21:07] man in the name of a righteous man
[1:21:09] receives a righteous man's
[1:21:14] reward. And if they do not if they want
[1:21:17] to know what a prophet's reward
[1:21:20] is to be a friend of the prophet.
[1:21:25] When you receive the prophet

[1:21:49] name, but he didn't believe
[1:21:52] it. Amen. He didn't believe that
[1:21:56] experience. Amen. The prophet asked him
[1:21:58] to pray and then in this prayer he was
[1:22:03] saying he said in his prayer, Lord, if
[1:22:05] what brother Abraham has said is
[1:22:09] true, let him find the the the the lost
[1:22:13] uhh
[1:22:15] squirrel. Amen. He did not
[1:22:18] believe. Amen. What the prophet told

[1:22:24] told to the sister
[1:22:27] Hardy, Amen, she said that that is

[1:22:39] third pool for the first time in a human
[1:22:44] being. I mean the third pool for the
[1:22:46] first time in a human
[1:22:48] being. Amen. which was the salvation of
[1:22:51] her ch of of her two
[1:22:53] sons. Amen. Because she
[1:22:56] received the prophet in his quality of a
[1:23:04] prophet. Amen. And the prophet says that
[1:23:06] the message and the messengers are
[1:23:09] one. Amen. So if you receive the
[1:23:13] message, Amen. You also receive the

[1:23:19] prophet. Amen. And if you receive that,
[1:23:23] Amen. you will also receive the

[1:23:36] a
[1:23:38] bride. Amen. Of the bridegroom which is
[1:23:41] Jesus
[1:23:42] Christ. Amen. Because the prophet says
[1:23:44] that it's not a denominational church
[1:23:46] that will do
[1:23:48] that. It's not a Baptist. It's not
[1:23:52] Methodist. Amen. But it will beat
[1:23:54] Malachi
[1:23:55] 4. Amen. That will put this church into

[1:24:32] prophets reward. In other words, their
[1:24:34] needs were were provided.
[1:24:39] And if you do the
[1:24:41] same, the same result will happen to
[1:24:44] you. Amen. The need of Abraham was the
[1:24:48] son. Amen. And because he received
[1:24:51] God. Amen. He received the son of man.
[1:24:55] Amen. He
[1:24:57] received. Amen. He was able to receive
[1:24:59] the
[1:25:01] reward. Amen. God gave him a
[1:25:03] son. Amen. God called him his friend.
[1:25:07] Amen. So if you receive God,
[1:25:10] Amen. If you receive this
[1:25:12] message, God will also give you your
[1:25:16] need. Amen. Even though it's an unspoken
[1:25:20] need, but just because you have received
[1:25:24] him. Amen. He would do the same thing as

[1:25:37] her.
[1:25:39] Amen. So if you do the same
[1:25:41] thing, God would do the same thing to
[1:25:46] you. Prophet said that when the moon
[1:25:48] goes
[1:25:55] down and the stars hide their face from
[1:25:58] the
[1:26:01] earth, and the last sermons preached.

[1:26:10] The church the church is blowed into
[1:26:14] bits and the rocks are conversing and
[1:26:18] crying
[1:26:20] out. The prophet said that I want to
[1:26:22] know
[1:26:24] him. Amen. As the poet in the song said,
[1:26:29] "I can see Adam and shake Eve and say,
[1:26:37] Eve, this is it,
[1:26:44] honey. Eve reaches over and shakes
[1:26:49] Abel." Amen. Abel shakes Seth.

[1:26:58] Abraham. Amen. The time is
[1:27:01] come. Amen. Know him in the power of his
[1:27:06] resurrection. Know that my
[1:27:10] inspiration that's been leading me and

[1:27:16] a
[1:27:18] fanatic and whatever
[1:27:20] more. It's brought me to the line.

[1:27:52] worry. Some morning it will pay
[1:27:57] off. It will pay off. Jesus will

[1:30:10] place for him to dwell
[1:30:13] in. Amen. Let's stretch out a place and
[1:30:16] welcome him to our
[1:30:18] hearts. Amen. Let's stretch out a place

[1:30:47] Lord, which means that I will do
[1:30:49] everything that you tell me to
[1:30:52] do. Let's stretch out a place and make a
[1:30:55] place for him to dwell
[1:30:57] in that some glorious
[1:31:00] day. When he returns back to
[1:31:04] earth, he will speak and will appear and
[1:31:07] we will appear in his likeness to live
[1:31:09] with him
[1:31:15] forever. Oh, I want to see him. I want
[1:31:19] to go with

[1:31:44] you. Open up your
[1:31:47] heart. Let him
[1:31:51] come. Don't take reasoning.
[1:31:54] Don't say, "Well, I've been a pretty
[1:31:56] good woman and we're a pretty good
[1:32:00] man." That's all right. It's a good
[1:32:03] thing to be a good man.
[1:32:05] But are you born again?
[1:32:09] Have you made a
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:13] preparation that when he comes
[1:32:16] by, he will resurrect your dead
[1:32:21] too, bring you to life
[1:32:24] again, I hope you
[1:32:27] have. If you have

[1:33:30] road. Amen. They invited
[1:33:34] Jesus amen in their houses in their
[1:33:37] house. Amen. After Jesus has talked to
[1:33:40] them along the
[1:33:42] way in the evening time, they invited
[1:33:44] Jesus to
[1:33:47] come to their
[1:33:49] house. Amen. And Jesus had communion
[1:33:52] with them.
[1:33:54] Jesus s with
[1:33:55] them. And they did what

[1:34:43] heart? Have you welcomed him to your
[1:34:45] house?
[1:34:48] Is it your friend?
[1:34:51] Amen. A friend is not just someone that
[1:34:53] you say as my friend.
[1:34:56] Image of friendship is shown by our
[1:34:59] actions. Amen. I can't call somebody my
[1:35:02] friend and turn around and start
[1:35:03] gossiping
[1:35:05] again. Amen. I cannot call somebody my
[1:35:08] friend and not welcome him when he comes
[1:35:13] in. Amen. Is Jesus your friend
[1:35:17] tonight? Amen. If he's not your friend,
[1:35:21] he's waiting for you.
[1:35:24] Amen. He wants you to stretch out a
[1:35:26] place for
[1:35:28] him. Amen. If you call him, he's going

[1:35:35] receive will depend on on how you're
[1:35:38] going to take care of
[1:35:41] him. Amen. Simon called Jesus and Jesus
[1:35:44] showed up to his
[1:35:46] house. He did not receive the blessings
[1:35:48] because he didn't take care of him.
[1:35:55] Amen. Zakius when Jesus invited
[1:35:59] himself, Zakius received him
[1:36:02] joyfully. That's why he was able to
[1:36:05] receive the
[1:36:06] blessings. Amen. So if you receive
[1:36:09] God joyfully, he will give you all the
[1:36:13] blessings. Amen. All your needs will be
[1:36:15] provided.

[1:36:37] his just because you have received a

[1:36:41] man in your house. And Jesus is a
