illuminate us Lord and open our eyes father our ears Lord and bless your children heal the sick in our mids strengthen the feeble by the time we leave live here can we s the two brothers in ous it was so good to be here and our heart burn within us we bless your name in Jesus name amen you have to believe in the Supernatural Revelations chapter 8 and verses 13 this morning uh we're just going to do a little teaching here and I beheld and heard an Angel flying through the midst of Heaven saying with a loud voice w w wo to the inhabitant of the Earth by reason of the other voices of The Trumpet of the Three Angels which are yet to sound now chapter 8 from verse 7 you see the first Angel sounded and the follow hail and fire mingled with Blood cast upon the Earth and third path of the trees was bent up verse 8 the second Angel sounded as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea third part of the sea became blood verse n the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed the third Angel sounded and there fell a great star from Heaven burning as it were a lamb it fell upon the third part of the rivers upon The Fountains of waters the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became worwood and many men they died of the waters because they were made bitter the third the fourth Angel sound and the third part of the sun was meeting third part of the moon third part of the Stars so the th the third part of them that was darken and the day shown not for a third part of it and the night likewise two things are happening here the first four trumpeters the angels that sounded affected the environment the last three woes are affecting the inhabitant or the people that occupy the environment may the Lord add blessings to his word Lord we honor you for your grace and this morning I pray for unction that you will come and bless us and the prophet told us that when the scriptures are written you bring life when we see the Fulfillment of it and the expectations because we know what you have done we look forward to what you're about to do what you are doing now we give you praise for it we thank you Father for your grace bless my wife and children brother gear this morning will be preaching and all the ministers that are handling the word of God this morning worldwide may you bless them Lord and anoint them for their services in Jesus Christ's name amen you see the Saints um I want to take a subject this morning and preach on the interval between the 6th and the 7th uh because uh many people today uh only know Jesus by the cross and that's all they can they can look at and that's so they can see they can never move on into any promises after that so may God help us today that as we progress into the word it will be a blessing to us amen amen um going to start with a quote in the seven seal page 534 paragraph 2 but Brenham says here that the sixth chapter ends up The Sixth Seal and it is correct Revelation chapter 6 it ends the six seals because the seventh seal is in chapter 8: 1 are you with me Church okay now but between the Sixth Seal and the seventh seal there is something that takes place between these how lovely that is placed just in its right place between the sixth and the seventh if you notice in the seventh chapter we notice that between the sixth and the seventh seal there is an interval between the sixth and the seventh of the Book of Revelation it is between the six and the seventh seal that this interval is given yes we want you to notice this very important that we notice this little time so if the prophet of God thinks that it is important for us to notice this time I want us to take our time and go into it amen are you with me church amen because we all understand that the Sixth Seal is the Tribulation seal so it is coming are you with me the seven seal has a threefold mystery to it but is saying that between the Sixth Seal that ends in chapter six and the seventh seal which is chapter 8 and: 1 there's an interval and the interval well it's Revelation chapter 7 and he want us to watch this now since we are living here at this time when Israel is not out of their Homeland Israel is in their Homeland now amen okay but Israel has not yet received there are two prophets and we are here we have to find out the reason why yeah and what is delaying them to receive they two prophets before I get into that let me get into the mystery between the sixth Church age and the seventh Church age you all know that the sixth Church age is the age of Philadelphia the age of Brotherly kindness the lisian church age is our age that started around 1906 you know many people say how can Bram say that the age started in 1906 and the messenger was born in 1909 the reason the messengers of the age do not appear at the beginning of the age they come at the end of the age to rebuke the age of their falling condition amen are you with the church amen okay there was an open door between the six and the seventh there was an open door but the bandam says here that an Open Door what was it it was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ not being a second person of a trinity but between God himself made flesh and R Among Us and the Revelation the name of Jesus is come back again between these two ages in between the open door now it is a revelation of what he was the deity Allelujah Hallelujah Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is it but a revelation of him amen and that Revelation is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name amen it was in the midst of the two last ages that the revelation of the Dy of Jesus Christ Blossom before us yes we knew he was God how else could he be our savior but to know that he was only God or God Alone that he was the Alpha and the Omega that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost or one person that had been lost since the first church ages but now we are seen it again the revelation of who he was had come back amen indeed God head is not a three person God with one personality for it takes a personality to make a person if there's one personality there is but one person but they who believe in three persons have a three God godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment amen so the Revelation between the six church8 and the Seven Church eight was the open door yes sir and the open door was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ coming back back to the church am amen he says again here in Daniel listen God Daniel you shut up the book for thou shall rest and you shall stand in the last days in your Lord but many of those who turn many to righteousness shall outshine the Stars forever and ever there you are the Stars these seven ministers through seven Church Ages which consists of 2,000 years but Bram is a mathematician too these seven ministers or seven stars are consisting of 2,000 years from the first 2,000 years the anti deluvian destruction the second 2,000 years the first coming of Christ the third 2,000 years the six is the second coming of Christ and the Millennium the end the seventh are you with me in other words the first 2,000 years is the word being destroyed by water the next 2,000 years was the Savior coming to shed his blood the next 2,000 years will be the end the seventh is the Millennium amen are you through church so there's going to be 120 jubilees let me explain a jubilee is 50 years so the first 40 Jubilee was the first 2,000 years because 40 by 50 is 2,000 are you with the church the second Jubilee is the 80th 80 multip by 50 is 4,000 and the last is our time that we're about to end and because Noah had 120 years and destruction came 120 jubilees will end man's time all right before I get into it let me bring the church memory to the seven Jewish feasts that God gave Israel for them to keep perpetually now these feasts were literally designed for the Jewish Nation but it has a spiritual application as well amen every time that they have the Passover Lamb it was supposed to remind them that someday there was going to be the real Lamb of God that will take away the sins of the world so the first feast was the Passover the second Feast was the Feast of unleavened bread the third was that of the wave Shea the fourth was Pentecost fifth was trumpets six was atonement and the seventh is Tabernacles the first Passover speaks of the Cross where the sacrifice will be Tabernacles speaks of them rejoicing at the end when they build boots therefore from the Passover to Tabernacles is speaking of a period of time from the cross to the Millennium when you start at the cross you don't stop there you have to come to Pentecost you don't stop there amen hallelujah you have to come to Tabernacles so in the first three feasts with pertains to both Christ and the church Jesus fulfilled the Passover because he was the Passover Lamb amen he was the unle bread amen amen there was no sin in him but he was made sin for us am he was the W sheep because he rose from the dead on the third day and was waved after the wave sheath you got to count from that day seven sabbaths amen seven sabbaths is the seven Church ages yes sir and the tomorrow after the seven the 14 night is actually the Jubilee sir which is Pentecost now after Pentecost and Pentecost this what happens Jesus fulfilled the Passover on leaven bread and the wave sheath by the Feast of Pentecost something happens yes sir you have to take two loaves of bread with leav in them and they had to to set the the bread on fire the two loaves of bread is showing the ministry of men with sin yes comprising of both Jews and Gentiles but the Holy Ghost Fire will consume the sin that's why the apostles in the upper room the fire has to come and Cornelius has to receive the same fire they had to bring both Jews and Gentiles into one body am therefore in Christianity is not a race Christianity is about Christ there is no Jew or Gentile in Christ he made all men one in him but the problem called that the super race amen after Pentecost the Jews are scattered they go back to their various homes never to come back again until the trumpets therefore we see a pattern after the apostolic age after the Gentiles everything came in what happened Titus scattered them they went to all the nations trying to pute the gospel India wherever they were scattered naturally the Jews lost their Homeland they were sold as slaves therefore Pentecost is fulfilled amen yes sir Passover is fulfilled unleaving bread is fulfilled web sheep is fulfilled what is not left is trumpets atonement and Tabernacle and since the Jews will only be gathered by the trumpets it has to take the trumpets to bring the Jews to their Homeland that's right the trumpets gathers the Jews that's right atonement give them a recognition of the morning of the sacrifice the trumpets when did they sound so brother Bram is trying to let us understand that between the Sixth Seal and the seventh seal there's an interval he want us to watch so let's go to Revelation 71 the pastor was singing as on the wind I said Lord Jesus I know the master of the wind oh my the song just came so good now after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth and I know people say the Earth is round and the Earth is round but the Bible say Four Corners since people these this are so dogmatic that they want everything to be be Dam imprecision round is also Square Hallelujah holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God he cried with a voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads and they had a number these four wings wind according to B Bram is war question answers page 9 93 paragraph 27 now on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds in other words here went the winds blowing in the wars and strife to come all over the world when did that ever happen never until the first world war holding the winds and they were striving going in to take over now Hallelujah but AB Bram is now beginning to bring this scripture of Revelation 71 that it took place in this generation that the wind was the war that never in the world have we had a World War but in this time there was a war now the three Wars are the three world wars yes sir it is not a repetition of one one thing there are three different woes wo wo wo maybe you say brother John why you saying that look at chapter 9: 12 for a second chapter 9:12 say one W is pass and behold there come two Wes more Hereafter so it is not a repetition of one W just going for there are three different walls yes sir all right the next wo is chapter 14 and vers four I believe no chapter uh chapter 14 vers 14 is it that oh sorry chapter 11:14 I'm sorry chapter 11:14 so sorry please it said the second war is passed behold the third war cometh quickly so the wars are three different Wars yes sir the Bible call them wo but said they are Wars amen so if they are Wars then they are the first world war second world war and the third world war amen are you with the church since the Jews have been Ed and they can only be gathered by the trumpets are you with the church then the first war if that be the first world war then it only sounded for one reason to bring the Jewish people back to their Homeland amen so when the first world war was ushered in the tur were taking over Israel at that time sir General Alm from Great Britain had to drive them out and Liberate the land of Palestine for the first time to come under British rule yes so the land was liberated but the people had not yet come but the people were in Europe making money in America making money but the name an anointing of Hitler to release a genocide in a second war or a second world war where 6 million of them were slaughtered yes then the Jews began to look for a land of their own you see under uh uh Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand in Spain it was the Jews after the Catholics will not get to be converted into Catholicism slaughtered millions of them and the rich Jews took money together and hired Christopher Columbus to find a land anywhere in the world for them to come and live in it was the money of the Jewish people that make Christopher Columba discover America that's why the principles of America is Bible based amen are you with me Church but now in the second world war the Jews including Europe and America have no place to go do you know that there was a shipload of of of of of Jews Coming to America they had to send a ship back a Hitler sped them there was no place for them but God had already delivered the land out of the Arabs hands and now he's going to put the people into the land amen amen so the trumpets gathered the Jewish people back to their Homeland in the second world war the third world war is amadan it is coming yes amen it will be fought after the tribulation just before the Millennium as a matter of fact we fight that battle that's right that's right the bride we fight it amen so now we are living between the second wo and the third wo since it is the trumpets that gathered the Jews brother Bram as a prophet of God these people don't know what they're talking about you got to see a a prophet respect him as a prophet take your time and and ask for Revelation in what he's saying to connect the dots together the prophet says here that these four Angels who were sounding their effect was upon the ecosystem of the wether inhabit in habitation of the Earth the environment that we live in but what caused it is as a result of the three last Wars the first world war you know how many people died and the effect of that war affected the Earth in fact it was said that the chlorine gas was used or the Master Guard was used they had the ability to destroy the world at that time yes sir but God did not permit it the war came to a mysterious end they don't know till today who commanded the war to stop yes they cannot unhal the Earth because God has a purpose that the Jewish people have to come back to their Homeland hold the wind Hold the Wall until we have sealed the servant of our God in the foreheads so the world stop and because it's a second w the prophet said now listen to be carefully Church the fifth seal is the sixth trumpet the fifth seal is the sixth trumpet 200 million demons were released and it anointed politics religion demon power to go after the Jew to slaughter them and they kill six million of them are you the church the seventh trumpet is the Sixth Seal because the two prophets are going to come in The Sixth Seal in the tribulation six trumpet fifth seal seven trumpet Sixth Seal correct in between the six trumpet and the Seven trumpet which is the calling of Elijah and Moses Ministry in the seven trumpet but Bram says it's Revelation 10 why because the sixth trumpet is Revelations 9 the seventh trumpet is Revelations 11 between 9 and 11 is revelation 10 a gentile Prophet to call the Bride of Jesus Christ out therefore six of those trumpets have already sounded the seven trumpet is for the Jewish people we are called by the great trumpet brother John I've said a lot in this short time but you cannot speak the word if you don't have your ties therefore we need to get our ties to put into the scriptures to make a f because we are here we are here and we have seen Israel in their homeand am therefore the fifth seal is be uh before the Rapture The Sixth Seal is after the Rapture so we are between the fifth and the six we are here we have something must happened to us so why are we here if the Jews are in their Homeland there is a purpose they have been gathered by the trumpets preparing for the Feast of atonement the Feast of atonement is not a recing of the Lamb amen it is a mour for the sacrifice and where would they mourn and say where we receive the wounds it will be the two prophets to bring on the revelation of Calvary that this Jesus Christ Yeshua that you killed is the one and the more that sacrifice because we have already believed it amen let's take the story of Naomi for a second Naomi's husband ELC took his family out of the promised land into a gentile country because things were not doing good in Palestine and they just left God to the life story of this one man in his family to tie the whole Jewish Nation I remember remember alimac his son Malon and chilion died in Gentile countries there were a type that were killed by Hitler melinian ikan and all those people in Jan land but the death caused them Naomi realizing that she had no more hope in a gentle country she's looking to come back yes sir therefore it took death to bring the to Palestine it took death to bring the Jews back home but was Naomi was coming back she had two daughters in-law Gentile women and ask one just go back to your families I got nothing to give you I can't give birth anymore I got nothing in my stomach let's go and serve your God one of them said yet it is true when I look at you this message when you follow it you don't have much bye-bye the other one said I'm not going back I have decided I have made a decision Amen in good times and in bad times I'm going to stay with the message regardless of what it is I'm going to go with you seek or th your God will be my God and the god of Israel is our God hallelujah your people be my people why do we love the Jews because we got a spiritual connection with them where you die I die it's a decision we can never reverse so when Naomi was coming back to Palestine there was a gentile Woman by the name of Ruth coming with her now also want you to understand the Naomi and this where people got get it but brandham said the day Israel was declared a nation now the prophet the angel met him many times people are looking to only one date to say that he made an error in that that's your problem what the prophet sees you can see that but I believe him I he said the very day the Israel became a nation I was receiving the Commission in the cave to take a message to the gentile people what I'm saying is that as nowy was going back to her Homeland God was also calling the GLE Bri and the scripture says in the Book of Ruth that Naomi came back to Palestine at the beginning of harvest this is Harvest Time Church she came at the beginning of harvest but Ruth was married at the end of harvest the beginning of harvest is when you see that the fruits are all coming out is the beginning of a new life hope but when you harvest it it's matured glory be to God so we have seen the beginning of the Jewish people we are about to see the first fruit in the hand of 44,000 they are the first fruit of God Revelations chapter 14 says that 144,000 the first fruits you go back script and check it amen in there we in a Harvest Time church and the bride is about to be harvested but when Naomi came to the land and at the beginning of harvest the attention though it was Naomi going back home the attention was on a gentile woman though the Jews have been in their Homeland God's attention is to pull the bride out of every organization thank you Lord so Ruth was directed by God to go to the field of boas who was the lord of the Harvest and also a Kingsman Redeemer the moment boas saw her said who is this woman he said she's Ruth the Widow of Chilean oh give her special treatment make sure that she never leave this field empty if she need anything on purpose drop it for her hallelujah hallelujah in this Harvest Time church we are feasting special Commandments huj stay in boas's field not any other field but boas's field and in boas field is stored food am if she wants the revelation of Jesus Christ give it to her amen if she wants B baptism give it to her to adoption give it to her whatever she needs as long as she's in the field Supply her need and as long as we are in this field our needs have been supplied by God don't go nowhere don't go nowhere there's nothing anybody's fi everything you need is here and then at the end of harvest it was Naomi who was going to instruct Ruth how to obtain the promise there is no promise that we can obtain without having the shadow in the Old Testament blessed be the name of the Lord he said today is the wi day he's going to sleep Mark where he's going to sleep and humble yourself and when you get there just go under his feet pull the scares of His Garment and cover yourself when he WS out to see that you are there it will be over brother we Mark where Jesus died we Mar the spot of Calvary we they strip him of His Garment when we took the Garment it became the brighter [Music] [Applause] garment and when they saw that he said I have to go and make everything right I got to go to the elders and bring Redemption and redeem the inheritance of eliminate now the person who supposed to do that the goel must be a worthy person and wealthy person somebody credible willing and also wealthy he must have the price to pay are you the church amen so he goes down there before the elders and that's why is so beautiful that this is the day for the book of redemption to be open but look at the Seven Seals and called it the book of redemption it is God redeeming you and showing you your inheritance in the promise because by Ruth marrying boas she is entitled to everything boas has and church when the seies was open to the bride it entitled us to [Applause] [Music] everything so Ruth now has been redeemed became the wife of boas and Ruth boas and Naomi lived off the inheritance of ELC are you with me church we the Jews are going to come back and reign in Jerusalem the very land amen that the Jews left off by the kingsman Redeemer it has been redeemed for us hallelujah let's take the next type Joseph but brandham says that Joseph is the perfect type of Christ he was hated by his brothers for no reason because he was spiritual he could tell them dream that he had and the father Jacob loved him above all the brothers and he was the 11th born does it appear to you why it has to be Revelations 11 he was the 11th born and Joseph Brothers hated him and they sold him out and who gained the Gentiles when the Jews hated Jesus who gained the Gentiles amen and Joseph was put in prison because he will not lie with another woman a man's wife ptif wife was already a married woman when you are married to organizations Jesus want to have this wise virgin not somebody's wife are you the jurge I hope you understand what I'm saying spiritually so as he will not mingle with organizations who have been married and polluted themselves he was accused of all kinds of stuff and they threw Joseph in jail why is in prison he had a baker and a battler there but the brother said Jesus on Calvary was in prison he had a Thief two theves on the cross Joseph in prison one was saved the other was condemned Jesus in prison on on the cross one was saved the other was condemned amen Joseph came out of prison and sat on the right hand of Pharaoh Jesus came out of prison and be start the right hand of the father amen the Tes are correct but that was not the end when Joseph came out of prison Pharaoh had a dream the reason why he came out of prison he interpreted a dream of pharaoh a dream of farming for seven years seven years of plenty and seven years of farming he has to keep the plenty to overcome the famine and there's a spiritual drought in the land right now that the only place that we can feed is the message of the hour when he interpreted Pharaoh's dream pharaoh changed his name from Joseph to zaniah pah that meant a savior so in Egypt Joseph has a new name as long as he remain Joseph every Jew would have seen him and as long as Jehovah remain Jehovah the Jews have no problem but when he told them I came in my father's name they took out stones see but the Gentiles love that name How Sweet the name of Jesus sounds in the Believers here it's like music in our ears it soes our wounds heals our wounds so his name is changed so everybody knows him as a savior Zephaniah bah and the drought it fine it so God is going to put a pressure on the Jews to go look for food soam says that this same gospel that we have believed will go back to them glory amen so the brothers came the first time they approach Joseph Joseph recognized them but they could not recognize him and the reason why they could not recognize him he was standing in their midst but they could not see him because of a name change you see Church there's power in the name what I'm saying is that lack of revelation of the name blinded them amen the revealing of the name will open their eyes because the two prophets will have the revelation of the father's name written on their foreheads hallu and that revelation of the name of Jesus Christ is what has blinded ludia as long as they have a theological concept of Jesus Christ as a second or third person they are blind amen but we our eyes have happened because the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ has come back to us we know that God we serve Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the [Applause] new so think of it when he saw them it was incomplete somebody didn't come Benjamin Benjamin doesn't come I will not reveal myself but AB Bram said 144,000 is little Benjamin oh glory be to God Amen so he played a prank on them that you people have been ungrateful took Simeon locked Simeon up he said when you bring the complete tribe then you'll get what you want when they went and told the father that Benjamin should come Jacob said you took Joseph why Benjamin why did you tell him that I have another brother said the question he asked he said Dad if we don't take him we all be dead they got to take shorty and everything Brothers it was Benjamin I said it is Benjamin Benjamin is the one now remember that Benjamin was not part of the conspirators am he was not part of those that conspired to sell a [Music] brother so God is looking for somebody to stand for their behal am and then when Benjamin came he set them on their tribal order from ruin to Benjamin and brought Benjamin closer to him but you see brother Bram said and this why I'm coming in the trumpets gathered Joseph's brothers to him Joseph will have to reveal himself to his brothers he cannot do that because at this time Joseph was a married man when Joseph was in Israel he was not married but when he came out of prison he was given a gentile wife when Jesus was in Palestine he was not married yes but when he died on the cross he died to obtain his bride the Bri was inside of him and the Bride of Jesus Christ is a gentile I said Jesus married a gentile you know I see people say that I'm a Jew and I'm a Jew and I'm glad I'm a gentile hallelujah hallelujah because the brothers where are they they still blind because it doesn't matter how much I love my brothers you know once I got my wife I said goodbye I took my wife and [Applause] godallah hi brother hi brother my brother don't stay with me my house my wife does so which one do you want to be his wife or brother you so don't boasting I'm a Jew and I'm a Jew and I'm a Jew Thank God I'm a asate a gentile wife now this woman asth is the daughter of a priest Joseph loved her they had two kids Ephraim man and he want to show himself to his brothers so bad he cannot do that why the Gentile woman was present but said the marriage take place here amen we are married to Christ here amen as a matter of fact he says that the marriage certificate is the Seven Seals Hallelujah invisible union he said you are wearing the wedding Bond of Grace the Rapture will go to the supper the Millennium is the honeymoon are you married to him then why can you break a covenant if you're married to him I said could not break a covenant with Joseph he loved Joseph she was loyal to him now for him Joseph to reveal himself to the brothers asth take the children and go to the Palace in other words get out of my presence honey stay at the marriage supper just go in the palace down there just enjoy yourself I got some business to take care of here so when Joseph had to reveal himself to the brothers the wife was not present amen amen and for Jesus to be revealed to the Jews we will not be here and the reason why we will not be here is because we have already been married by the word hallelujah and because we are married he has a right to take his wife where he want to therefore the Feast of trumpets is the Gathering of Joseph's brothers to Joseph in between Joseph revealing himself and the Gathering there's a Rapture that takes place Revelation 16 I'm going to go into this very soon but here brother brand I'm talk from verse 13 I uh verse 12 and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the waters thereof was dried up that the way of the king of the East might be prepared heard I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the Beast out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are spirits of devils working miracles which go forth onto the kings of the earth and of the whole earth to gather them to the Battle of that great day of Our God Almighty which is the third wo or amaden verse 15 while this Gathering is going forth to gather all the kings of the earth together for that great battle coming behold I come as the thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth His Garment lest he walk naked and they see verse 16 and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue aadan are you with me church so in between aadin and the Gathering is he come like a thief Amen brother Bram said the Rapture will be a sudden secret catting away he said if 500 people came missing from the earth they not even know anything about it let me uh just say something that may be shocking to you but I don't think around the world in the message we are we are even more than 150,000 you say brother John why do you say that now now all of us who are here let me just ask a question question how many message Believers live in the area where you live at your workplace or your school how many message Believers are in your workplace take your whole vicinity your area where you live you might be the only one there at your work you might be the only one at your school may be two that is the way we are scattered in the world but say you look at the darkness you see one little light say believer that walking it makes you count yourself worthy that you are special that amidst this Darkness God will pull you out to be the light to reflect him he comes like a thief what does a thief do he come to steal kill and destroy so he comes said to steal his wife like Romeo and Juliet take his lover away and after that he's coming to destroy them who destroy the Earth praise God so Joseph having his brothers come to him is the trumpet the Rapture of asenet he comes like a thief and take his wife away amen the revealing of Joseph to the brothers is the Feast of atonement in the Feast of atonement they are not going to kill Joseph again they are going to have a revelation of what they rejected the one they rejected is going to be their savior amen he told them you bow I saw the moon the stars bow before for me and they kill me because of that but now they're going to do it he look at them he said come Ruben come Benjamin come Judah come isaka come Zeon come they look at him he knows our name he said I am Joseph oh brother you could look that day in that room see said I told you Brothers I told you you see that they said now we know we are finished you're going to kill us he said no no no no no no he said you me it for evil but God had me for all the trials to prepare me to save the household of Israel amen because if I had not come would have all perished in a drought you meant it for evil but God meant it for good and Jesus took love to conquer hatred you know sometime we talk about these things is very tough for a man that really will destroy your name and and say any kind of to come back and tell him that brother I love you Joseph did that and Jesus had to do that on the cross he said father forgive them for they don't know what they doing because they doing that in blindness and ignorance Hallelujah therefore the of atonement is the recognition of Joseph it's not a killing of Joseph it's a revelation of the men they rejected in the Feast of atonement is the morning for the sacrifice for them to have a revelation of the Jesus they rejected amen that he is the savior of the world Amen and they have to bow at the name of Jesus at the feet of Jesus Oh glory be to God and did you realize that because they accepted atonement they had a privilege to enjoy the benefits of Joseph's position for them to live in Egypt with peace they were treated with royalty until a pharaoh came who did not know them but until that time they were given all kind of privileges because Joseph was there Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord church so we are living at a time right now where we the Gentile bride we have to leave the Earth the pope this morning is telling abas and the Jewish people that they is peace talk that cannot be resolved is not I use a word in other words we have to work around this peace talk and I'm offering my home to you and the Israelis you must all compromise come to Rome come to Vatican I call it Vatican amen come to the city of Cain and I'll be able to give you a nice Covenant this morning the popet is saying that this is where we are living right now church and these brothers who are defecting are telling you that go back to Vatican when a man is bln from Revelation you can do anything without thinking it's a strong delusion which has HD them amen as I said that let me take the final one before I close this morning but brandham says here in the uh mystery between the sixth vile and the seventh V which I just read it says Revelation 1613 to14 if you want to put that down it's a be sure that when you go home you can see it this is the sounding between the sixth and the seventh vial so we'll close out just in a minute if you can just bear with me in a few minutes close out now Revelation 16: 13-4 between the sixth and the seventh vial it said three unclean spirits like frogs did you notice that went out of the mouth of someone are you ready say Amen it is a trinity of frogs a frog is an animal that always look backwards he he never looks where he's going he looks where he's coming from don't you see where tarianism was born at free unclean spirits individual Spirit are you getting it they look back to NAIA where the Trinity doctr was born at not in the Bible and these brothers are denying the godhead that brother bram's teaching was a error of the godhead and the should go to Trinity it's on the website you can read it for yourself notice where they come from the Trinity of frost came out of an old Trinity giving birth to a new Trinity their mother what it come out of a trinity the dragon the Beast and the false prophet and treated a new one for when were these frogs come out when did it notice they were there all the time but it wasn't my manifested until between the sixth and seventh vial just before the seals open to reveal it now you know sometime people don't realize that the seals when we say it was opened we are not telling you that they manifesting now because the first seal already happened second seal already happened third seal already happened we are living in the shadows of the fourth are you me Church the fifth seal is history now it happened in 1939 to 1945 the six seal is coming the tribulation the seven seal brings him back to Earth to do what to get the wife in marriage because the servant seal is a brighter seal amen hallelujah yes but brandham says that it's like a rocket is the end time seal it blasts from one thing opens into the next open into the next and even ushers us into the Millennium that's what this seven seal is all about amen it's a coming down to pick up a bride in marriage give her a seal the Covenant Hallelujah put her in the Rapture and the body change and bring her back all is about in fact in Christ in the midst of God revealed he said it's a three for purpose one of Christ the church and taking us to Eden the seven seal don't stop is the end time steel taking us on we are in it amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord notice the were all there all the time but was not manifest until now for in the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of God will be known all these traran and false baptisms and everything else God help us to see what truth is and not to think that somebody is trying to say something in closing the first miracle Jesus did was at a wedding the first miracle Christ did was being invited to a wedding the last miracle he has to do is to finish the wedding and when he went to the wedding something took place they were lacking something you don't make weddings and get short of drink what kind of embarrassment is that you go to a wedding to enjoy the wedding only water is there they lack wine and then what they lack is what Jesus had to supply and then Mary went ahead and tried to give instructions and then Jesus said woman what have I got to do with you that's no insult but the church cannot give Revelation mary caught the revelation of the preeminent one standing in their midst and said you see him whatever he tells you do do [Applause] it Mary was directing them to him but Abram directed us to Christ the pastors will give us to Christ who is Christ but said Christ is the revealed [Applause] word he said if Jesus Christ should come today with nail scared hands I will not believe him because that's not the way he said he will come yes sir Christ is the revelation of the word amen so Mary said now everybody don't look at me now Look to Him that's why the Catholic church I'm sorry we can't look at you we have to look at Jesus now they said we should go through Mary Mary said go through Jesus Hallelujah and then Jesus said what do you have here they said pots what are pots how many of them six the scripture says in John chapter 2 is it let's get there for a second John two I believe it is and the third day there was a marriage in K of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there and both Jesus was called and his disciples to do the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus said unto him they have no wine Jesus said unto her woman what have I what have I to do with thee mine hour is not yet come his mother says unto the servant whatsoever he says unto you do it and there were said there watch the six water pots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the Jews containing two or three fing a pieces it was for the purifying of the Jews six water pots standing for the purification of the Jews uh just let me get what brother was saying here about it and then I just want to get into it amen where are you I just saw it it just disappeared oh my all right so the six water pots is a type of the six seal where the Jews are going to be purified are you with me church but they needed something to open their understanding and Jesus said fill it with water they fill the C with water and Jesus said draw the water became wine when a man is truly baptized with the Holy Spirit what comes out of you is the stimulation by revelation of the word that's the reason why you are all worshiping this morning the way you are doing the reason why you enjoy the word of God is because you are been stimulated your water has been turn into wine Hallelujah the devil can never steal this Joy away from me I feel like Peter this morning I feel like staggering hallelujah amen I feel like Peter anointed by the Holy Ghost and the man said look at him it's not even the morning you drunk he said brother you don't know what is happening I am drunk Hallelujah listen this is the Awakening of Jo's prophecy I am seeing Jo's prophecy manifested in my life are you want me to sit still Hallelujah I am seeing Malachi 4 manifested in my time you want me to sit still I see Revelation 17 and verse 30 manifested in my time Revelation 101 Revelation 107 oh glory be to God I see myself in the word I see myself a promise you want me to sit still I can't my water has been turned into wine oh glory be to God Amen because wine is a stimulant brother when a man is drunk he can say anything he want and he can talk any house and he can walk any house when he's drunk you can laugh at him and he's going like that you laugh at him he's going like that when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost is not asham we are not ashamed of the messenger I am not embarrassed about the message William Bram is God's Prophet I believe the word maybe God did not send him to you but malach he said behold I send you not them I send you you are the reason why Elijah had to come without you no Elijah Elijah is coming because of you and me we are the benefits of Elijah's message we cannot go to the word and tell them goodbye world I stay no longer with you come on Pastor goodbye pleasures of life I stay no longer with you I made up my mind to go God's way part of my life I made up my mind go God's way goodbye word goodbye word oh I stay no longer with you
