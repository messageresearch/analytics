TRANSCRIPT
========================================
man by the wisdom of God we thank you dear Lord Jesus that thou art our God our Lord and our Savior we are so grateful for the grace that has been showered upon us that we have come this far by grace and we know your grace would never let herself we thank you Jesus for being the author and the finisher of our faith we have come this far trusting in you and the Bible says that dead up would be our trust in you would never be put to shame where no dear Lord Jesus you're going to glorify yourself in us we thank you for the journey embraces granted us thus far we came from far and near well generous is or you have been very faithful to us Lord we give you the glory this morning we give you the honor we praise the Lord we worship thee we blush thee and we uplift and glorify your Holy Name O God our Lord and our master we have come to worship we have not just come to see one another's faces Lord we have come that we may hear from you open our ears to hear open our eyes to see beyond the cattle of the flesh bless us this morning you know the desires of our house you know the nice in our life's mode and we do come a minister unto us from lip to ear there are as many of us that have gathered this morning would never leave your presence the way we have coming give us a cause to rejoice go John in the name of Jesus father we pray and we thank you so very much that we are ferent as they are free a show visit god bless you sings happy to see you all in the house of God it is not the number number doesn't mean anything to God it is the quality of the spirits and we are so grateful to be here in Iowa this morning to fellowship with you you know my brother one told me on Tuesday where Isaiah Brooks was travelling and if I could come around I said why not it's been a very very long time it would be nice to come and see their bread ring and just have fellowship so by the grace of God we are here trusting the grace of God watching I just want to tell us is that whatever you find yourself doing for God do it with all your heart and do it oh it doesn't matter what anybody understands you nobody have to understand it it doesn't matter what our people believe in what you are doing they don't have to believe in you it is your relationship with God praise be to God you may be seeing what they are not seeing and the power of God said that whatever we do for God would never go in vain if it is a glass of water you fetched or you give to a servant of God wholeheartedly God is going to bless you for it you know you look at life most of the times we have not treated God fairly at all grace his love his mercy his divine protection just think about it but you know we get to places in our lives on most of the times we give ponder necessary excuses umbrella Branagh said a life full of excuses it's not worthy of the possible we love our jobs so much that we will go to work what a rain or shine we'll go to work weather is slow it or not what are the temperatures are below negative 50 we'll go to work anyhow why because we don't want to be fired but if it's Sunday morning o Wednesday 9 o clock I don't know what it's night service here on Wednesdays and then you open the door and then you see half an inch of snow in front of the house it's enough reason to go and then light down it has snowed let me just go and rest and you expect God to understand that lord have mercy [Music] we don't treat God fairly just think about it the work we are doing and the things we gather for ourselves what are we going to carry them then there God takes the breath of life out of you other tastes you gather in this life what are you going to do with them you are going to pass it on so why do we have to waste time doing all the overtime gathering all the resources the wealth of this world that one day we will just die and then go and leave them here but the most important thing that we should actually concentrate on our relationship with God we are not doing it the most important team the one and only reason while we are here in this life is to do the will of God it's okay to wake because the Bible says he that has nowhere should not eat they do not use Gauss time for when it's okay to use the time for work for God but not the other way praise be to God we ought to be very very serious in our do not stop in it make sure that you are in the perfect will of God sometimes you think that oh come into service go in every day come in every Sunday every Wednesday go in sometimes the devil tells you know what it's like nothing is changing is the same old thing remember the devil is a liar he has been a liar from the beginning he is a liar today and you consider to be a liar one that never tells you you're not a child of God what it means is that you are a child of God when the devil tells you look left it means look right when the devil tells you stand still that means run for your dear life the devil is a liar praise be to God our service for God would never go anyway you coming to church every Sunday coming to church every Wednesday to hear the word of God would never go in vain you may not see the growth in your life it's like you having a little child in the house you give birth to them you are living with them under the same roof you don't even know when they grow you don't know when they stretch that is how it is as you feed on the Word of God you are growing but you don't get to see it until there is an opposition there's something in you comes out praise be to God your friends your relationship other people can look at you and see the growth but sometimes sadly enough you don't see it praise be to God one in 1989 my my my my my head my head teacher I was do my national service at a time and he told me a story I have said it a number of times he said there was a young man that after he saw sixth-form he wanted to go to the university but he didn't have money to go so he decided to sell some books around together some money to be able to further his education then one day he went to the village selling books and then he was so thirsty he saw a little girl and he asked for water the little girl ran into the room took a tin of milk came open it put it in a cup and then other words written give it to him to drink and then he drank it shortly after that they just said say and what book is this and then he cannot give had a background then the girl asked can I have one he just stood for long he said I am sorry I wish I could give you one but it's just not possible I'm very very sorry the boy left but it played on his mind so much but before he did he asked the little girl what is your name the little girl told him his name the parted company for years they didn't meet this guy went university hide his education he was a doctor and he was posted to work in a village and he was working this little girl had also grown and was married in the same village and then as fate would have it she was pregnant she wanted to give birth and she had complications they rushed her to the hospital and this doctor had closed and Accord him to come back and when he came he looked at the name he said this name looks familiar I don't know the last name but the fresh name looks familiar and then he did his best by the grace of God saved the baby and saved the mother and then after everything he went there and was talking to the lady where do you come from and then through conversation you got to realize that this was the same lady who gave him a tin of milk and a cup of four so in Africa surgical operations are expensive everyone now the husband was thinking how am I going to pay for this surgical operation a poor farmer so he went around selling his boots selling his sheep to gather money before the husband would come to the hospital the doctor just wrote paid with a tin of milk so when the husband came and then the lady took the baby they came for the surprise coming to here maybe some million when they came they saw paid what I do not know what does this mean it doesn't make sense then they asked what does this mean they say no it's paid for with a tin of milk the lady had forgotten the wood she did buy the man never forgot so it was their dismay now try to bring her back into the picture where it all started and then she started whipping now I was thinking about and I've always thought about it that we men being evil the nature of man is to do evil outside of God there is nothing good in a man and for that matter a woman and if man being evil knows how to do good in circumstances like this how much more the God we are seven he never forgot of that tin of milk this little girl give to him four years never think that your service to God would be anything it would never be anything when you get up from your house I don't care how long it takes to drive I don't care driving in the snow I mean just do your best this time we are living in is not a plate it's homegoing time there is nothing in this life think about Solomon of all that he had the wisdom the wealth what up what can I mean what else can you talk about an end of it all they said life is nothing but vanity upon sometimes you're willing to wait you want to go their car you are driving too wet doesn't want to go I've had instances you will go in the towel just make 180 it will just slide you want to go to where the car wants to go back home is there no you will go to ad buy phones and you'll force the car and you go to work but if it is a service if you slide once then you call I have a problem I can't come in today remember in prayer I mean it's sad we have to step up because the Bible says come up high we have to come up behind in our walk with God we have to come up high completion see should be out of date should be out of the question praise be to God by the grace of God today we are going to look at a seminal prophet preached and now we are taking our reading from Exodus if we can please stand for the region of the world Exodus 14 15 Exodus 14 15 I read and the Lord said unto Moses well for Christ ow unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they'll go forward may the Lord Artus blessing to the reading of his word in Jesus name Amen child isn't so we are going to talk about why cry speak why cry speak praise be to God now when God told Abraham that he said after him was going to be in a strange land for hundred years there would be persecuted and after that he was going to deliver them by his mighty hand Abraham may never have understood it he may have thought over it is it going to be war how is Israel going to end up in another country what is going to happen he may have thought of it thought over it over and over but you know what when birth says something it is settled praise be to God but says exactly what it means and he means exactly what he says God does know play with ways we human beings have the tendency to play with ways we can sell something and we don't mean it other times though we mean what we say but we don't have what it takes to bring it to us now we can say something and we mean it Jenya sincerely better time comes for us to back our way or our promise and then we are not in the position to do it I've seen a situation where somebody gives somebody a promise you know what when it is your wedding I am going to rent you a hole for your wedding and they actually mean it where the time comes and they don't have a job anymore so the promise it is not so with God when God speaks it is settled it is the duty of God to bring his way to pass it is not for you and I to bring the Word of God to pass no we just have to keep ourselves in line with the weight and keep believing and we shall see the hand of God anyhow it is the duty of God to bring this way to pass and when birth speaks there are not enough demons in Hell that can stop it praise be to God so when God told Abraham it was settled it is not for you to try to imagine or think about when God told Abraham that you are going to have a child Abraham we have wondered in my see how old I am see how old service is that come out look at the heavens see if you can count the stars that is how your seat after you is going to be Abraham I am thinking of Eliza inheriting me you are not only giving me a child but uncountable I mean when you try to figure it out you may end up having a nervous breakdown it is not for you to think of how God is going to do it it is not for you to think of when God way is like we're going to do it just leave it alone and God and it's all in his own time at the right season God will make sure that his word comes to pass they are prophesied and veggies are conceived I believe after the prophecy as I may have sat down what did I just say did I say a very shy fancy critical but it takes God to bring his way to pass and it was settled now Abraham begot Isaac as he because Jacob and Jacob because begat the twelve patriarchs now remember Isaac had two children Jacob and Esau by the Covenant of God was with Abraham Jacob was with Abraham Isaac and Jacob Saul was out of the game if you can just read Romans 9 11 to 16 just to refresh our memories Romans 9 eleven phrase beauty good for the children not yet born Nita haven't done in a good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that will have know of him that runneth but of God that she was mercy praise be to God so we believe in in in the subject of predestination it is not of him that we live know of him that runneth it is not because of your good works because the Bible has made it clear our good works as filthy rags in the sight of God is good to do good but never count on your good works praise be to God never count on them they as filthy rats in the sight of God it is just the mercies of God is the grace of God a favor you don't deserve the children were not yet born and God said Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and they had not done anything yet not yet even in this life but by foreknowledge God knowing the end from the beginning the beginning from the end he knows who his owner weave Pro where ever born praise be to God that was why God they're perfect oh yeah where were you when the morning stars sang together and what are the sons of God shouted for joy and that was before the foundation stone of this world was ever costs praise be to God we are children of God nothing can stop it that devil cannot stop the move of God praise be to God we are children of God God foreknew as before there was a world now don't forget this flesh this flesh he does not define who you are we don't take our identification from this flesh when you read Genesis 1 every day God created something new under 6 day birth said let us create man in our own image and in the image of God created he them male and female and he called him other Presby to God that was the spirit man and that spirit man could not fall the spirit man could not seem the spirit man knew where he stood praise be to God there was nothing that would move him he knew who he was spirit of his spirit spirits don't have flesh but allow me to say that bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of Spirit just to lay emphasis on what I'm trying to put across and in the state when you read Genesis 1 on this is day when God created man in his own image the spirit man it was a period full stop the Bible says and it was finished praise be to God and it was finished on the seventh day God rested and then when he saw that everything was perfect and there was no man to till the ground that was when God formed took some piece of clay he just firmed man and he breathed into man his breath of life and man became a living soul no there is something here remember that our true identification is in Genesis 1 the men of Genesis 1 is our true identification it was settled and the Bible says it was finished our Redemption eternal life it was finished but God had an attribute in him an attribute to be a savior and God wouldn't be a savior with man being in the spirit firm form and God one eighth month for it is not our desire to fall it was not our heart desire to do evil God wanted man to fall so he took a piece of clay he took that man in Genesis 1 brought him to Genesis 2 and put him inside a and that was why the fall came and that takes us to what a Genesis story why the praise be to God so remember if you have fallen it's okay brother branham said that God would not hold you for being a sinner because that's the condition which we are born you can't help it insane was I conceived any iniquity was that shipping you can't help it but God would hold you for choosing to remain a sinner so it's okay oh I did this wrong forget of the past the past belongs to the past get up move on the past does not define who we are this man of sin does not define who we are our true identification is that man of Genesis one and there is nothing that can stop us I don't care what I read or shine I don't care the persecution I don't care the poverty I don't care the sickness I don't care the disease I don't care what the devil does there are not enough demons in Hell that can stop us from doing the will of God we are sons and daughters of God manifested sons and daughters of God and we shall do the will of God anyhow I don't care what happens if the devil couldn't stop them in the dark ages where they kill them and kill them and kill them and they got tired and they just said the fire and asking them to just jump in if the devil couldn't stop them they'd ever cast of us praise be to God we are talking about white crime so the Covenant of God excluded me so God didn't know him he was praise be to God now Jacob gave birth to the twelve patrons and out of the twelve there was one that he loved so much just that he soothed him a coat of many colours the love that he had for him provoked Envy from the rest you know parents or potential parents just if you have children you may have some special love for one above the rest for whatever reason just try as a father or as a mother to manage it when it becomes too obvious you have created a problem writing you have sown a seed of discord between and among the children learn to manage them there was a storm in Joseph's life why because the father loved him so much so the brothers were very angry and to add to that Joseph had a dream that one day he was on the field with his brothers and his brother sheaves stood up and made a new business to his sheep and then when he told the story they got offended I already do were angry with him now he raised it up so do you mean that we are going to worship you they didn't take kindly to it he had another dream you know children being children he just came again I had another dream that a moon later the Sun eleventh us bowed before me even his father didn't take kindly to it his father was angry so you mean me your mother and your brothers I won't worship you what did you get come on well from here praise be to God Oh and then his brothers putting tickets what does this little boy think about himself and then one day his brothers went as usual to take care of the animals then Jacob calls him is being long after no head from your brothers can you go find out where they are so see how they are doing and then come back and let me know he was very happy a little boy that had not seen his elder brothers he was very very happy working in the wilderness yes running here and there hoping to see them and when he saw them he was so so happy Oh finally I've seen them thinking there was going to be a fellowship not knowing the hard plan and when you saw him they said there comes the dreamer we are going to kill him today and see what becomes of his dreams and has he came nearer they planned what to do they caught him Ruben didn't like the idea it said no don't kill him because he knows how much your father loves him said no don't do it ok know what we can do just leave him in the world here and let him just be there and then perish he wanted to come back later taking curry but that is so a merchant that was on his word to Egypt and the real Luke gets connived you know what instead of living him in the world to die let us sell him to make some money be careful with money the love for money is the root of all evil it is not bad to like money but when it moves from like him money to the love of money then that is why the problem is the love of money can cause you to kill for money it can cause you to rob for money it can cause it to steal for money money is a very very button we are working it's because we like the money that's not wrong when we get a raise we are happy when we got promotion we are happy why because it comes with money but never never never disodium and when the sodium they were happy we have sodium we are done with his dream who can fight against God praise be to God who can fight there is a god-given purpose in every single life the prophet of God said God did not create you and how to see how we look another human being no there is a reason why God brought you here you are here to serve the purpose of God and nothing less and nothing more find out why God brought you a 4 there is a reason other than wear to school there is a reason other than working there is a reason other than doing business there is a reason and your infant insight that I am NOT going to wake and I know even go to school I don't know do entertain I just want to sleep from 1:00 until evening there is still a purpose for you praise be to God just think about it our bodies the hand is not just there for the sake of it the eyes are not just there for the sacraments the legs are not just there for the sake of it they are there to perform tasks the eye is performing its duties the hands are performing their duties their legs are performing the activities and all of us children of God we are members of one flesh and as members of the body of Christ we have a god-given function to perform can you think about it when the ladies decide to wake and the I see I'm not working the legs will carry the body I mean you let me know where you're going the I said no our knowing the leg is willing to work there I say ok I'm ready to wake the Alexis I'm not working just think of the disco so there is a purpose in your life there is a god-given purpose pray that God opens your eyes to see his purpose in your life that is the only way you can become successful in your walk with God other than that you will try this because you see people doing it it will not wake you will try that because if we're doing it it will not wake you would just be alright beating around the bush not really what you are doing is because we have not found your place in God but when you find your place in God you are going to be a successful praise be there was a purpose in the life of Jesus and when the sodium and thought you were done with the purpose the purpose of God in his life little did they know the oh they were doing was rather fast tracking it they were rather pushing pushing him to the realization of his god-given purpose they didn't know now Joseph ends up in Egypt it's a very very very very bad thing when people people who you think should be there for you turn your backs it doesn't matter at what level whether in the church setting whether in the family setting what are in an organization it doesn't matter the city but I believe it is more painful and more serious when it comes down to the house of the people you think have your back their people you think are there for you the people you think would die for you at a point where you need them the most then you realize that oh they were not there I mean that alone it's like taking the breath out of you I begin to imagine how was Joseph feeling these are my elder brothers people I love so much people I would do anything for people I know had my back man they would never harm me they will never do anything evil against me and they treated me this way it takes to overcome a situation praise be to God he ends up in Egypt they sold to Potiphar and aperitif of course in love with hands everything in his household to him his servants his businesses his account is everything he handed it over to Joseph to take care of it because when Joseph came to his house he saw the blessings that came to that house be careful who comes under your roof oh there are people that just have a huge load of cash on them when they come under your roof they have brought trouble stop going back but but this and you can't figure out what is going and also there are people that will come in your life and you see the sunshine you'll see the prosperity you will see things falling in place what if I was quick to know disease he saw a faithful and obedient hard what engine but it wasn't so with parties but but Potiphar's wife party first wife saw something different a potential boyfriend a handsome yourself somebody to misbehave which but joseph wouldn't get praise be to God a child of God you must take a stand based on the word there is no way you can live a successful Christian life outside of the Word of God it must be according to the word it must be in the word take a stand we are here to be tempted into the take a stay there isn't why we find ourselves most of the times the wind comes it takes us day the way another wind comes blows us over there like like a balloon on the sea being closed by the waves it's because we have not taken our stand but when you come to that place and you say I have taken my stand I don't care what happens like a three Hebrew children when they did not bow to that image and they say if you don't bow you I'm going to the face into the fiery furnace that's how we are ready to go we have taken our stand our Lord is able to deliver us and if he does not deliver us was to not bow it's better to die 7go than to live in this sinful wretched life I don't care how many years you Romero was saying that if there are two buttons and there is one button here they say press this button and you will live for 10,000 years and after that die and go to hell you don't know God and there's another button here they suppress it and you are just going to enter into the presence of God you would die a child of God then next second instead I'm going to press that one and dive right in a second praise be to God I will press it and I read the next second when you live in this life a thousand years and you die without knowing God what is the use of it what is the use of it you are a miserable creature what is the use of it take your Stang which let your wet let the wet be your absolute let your life and come on nothing by the Word of God it doesn't mean other songs will not come that stops who succumb but you have an uncle praise be to God you have an uncle your uncle ho's within the solid veil of the Word of God there is nothing a devil can do praise be to God in Potiphar's house the stone escalated when Potiphar's wife framed charges against him and what happened what if I go so angry with him and then put him in prison even in prison even in prison the blessings of followed him in prison you know when the favor of God is upon you it breaks every earthly protocol this may not make sense to people yourself you look at it and it will just blow you in the face is the favor of God upon your life but is not looking at you looking at the blood praise be to God even in prison the favor of God was still upon the blessings of God followed him any day that a prisoner of this will come you say Joseph you know I'm supposed to lock you up together with this prisoners here but you you look so different there is something about your life you know what you take the key load them up just like see a anything you want to do just do it that was how much authority he had even in the prison and one day two prisoners had a dream he told him what a dreams meant one will be killed the order will be set free it came to pass and the one that was set free went back and he was 7th in the palace of Pharaoh even though just a told him when you go out don't forget of me he went out he forgot of him that is human nature once again we are so self-centered so so self-centered every good thing oh it should be me every good thing it should be me but if there's something bad let it go to this brother oh let it go to this system so all the good things are good for you by the batter should go to somebody else why not you for the but as God would have it fairing himself when they had a dream he saw seven lean cows and seven fat cows and the lean ones swallowed the seven fat ones he woke up went back to bed again and he had a second dream he saw seven fat cone on one stick seven lean ones and a lean ones devout the seven big ones so what is this and then he told this is wise men nobody could come up with an interpretation they didn't know what was going on this was the time that ex-convict remembered now okay there is somebody in prison who can tell you the dreams you had are you sure he said yes he told me a dream that is how I know that he can tell you whatever these rings Pharaoh sent for him they took him from prison they brought him and then he gave the interpretation of the dream how I was going to be seven years of plenty and after that do be seven years of drought famine in the land Pharaoh so what should we do say you know what let's get the seven years of plenty less store the excess so in the next Sabine yes when there is going to be hunger we'll have enough to feed I said that is right you know what you are going to be the head of this project praise be to God they took him out of prison not only that but he became the true I see the prime minister in Egypt that of all the worst in Egypt after Pharaoh there was nobody else but yourself now everywhere he went there people bowed before him they worshipped him they respected him that was how much influence just have got in Egypt again when the favor of God is upon your life it breaks every earthly protocol wonderful and seven years of plenty they store the excess and then the next seven years there was drought there was nothing to eat people were hungry everywhere on the edge surface but Egypt had see how the Word of God was good it was not another country coming to Israel to conquer Israel and to take them into captivity no see gradually gradually gradually gradually the Word of God is coming to pass go telling Abraham that you see after you would be in a strange land for hundred years to be persecuted see how it is playing gradually one step of taking order nothing can defeat the plan of God have confidence in the word yourself put all your hopes in the god yourself God would never let you down praise be to God never listening to the devil the devil is our enemy the devil is not a good friend the devil does not get free gifts and a free gift you see coming from the devil is a there is a hook a hook hiding in that you see it looking so nice you swallow it it's nothing get into your stomach that is how we kill the devil we don't reason with the devil never reason with it the Bible says flee from every appearance of evil sometimes we want to sit and then just play around same play around evil and you don't know when you are taking on our words he has been in the game keep your distance Joseph becoming a prime minister Washington whatever he passed they bowed before now Israel and that there was food in teachings we know the story I'm not going to go into all that I don't know it's a good scene you guys don't have a plug here amen yes so and finally Israel ended up in Egypt because there was famine in Israel now look at it when Joseph told them who he was and they started crying and begging for forgiveness what did you say you know sometimes God allows situation to come he allows it it is not every time that it is the devil the devil is responsible for the temptations but God is behind our trials because the trail of our faith to God is more precious than dun-dun-dun good in fire the Bobo has made it clear that if you are being tempted do not say that you are being tempted by God because God does not tempt any man but man out of his own lusts false in temptation but God would bring trials away now God did to ever like God did he would test you would test you there is a testing time for every child of God God is going to test you but is going to prove you that love you say you have for God do you truly have love for God God is going to prove it that when push comes to shove when you get to the nitty gritties when you get to their reality I used to burn a stunt frame we are going to cave him God is going to prove you when nobody knows how he is going to do it nobody knows but God will surely prove every one of his children whosoever God loves the Bible says he was just nice and the prophets say that we pray to God we ask for the best and God gives us the best I know what the prophets said is the best persecution persecution nobody wants to go through persecution you go through it sleepless nights your cry cry cry if it's at work maybe you enter the toilet cry and wash your face and come out smiling so nobody sees it it's not an easy thing going through trials but it is so so good for the soul that when you go through it and you know what most of the times why our trials last so long is because we don't see God in the trial we keep blaming it on the devil blaming it on the devil if it's a trailer they alien you see God in the trailer because God would connect what's the right way this guy's himself he would disgrace himself the alien you see this o is God it's you the end of it praise be to God but so long as you keep blaming it on the devil you keep blaming it on that 400 already behind a building every single problem you have you are blaming it on somebody you are going to last very very long in that trial there Elya you see it and the alien you know it is good training you the error it comes don't just blame it on some poor lady behind a building or some poor innocent little I mean no praise be to God Joseph was quick to notice it and sometimes when you have gone through all that God will just turn right back and put the same people in your hands to see what your reaction is going to be your brothers were against you they wanted to kill you and the finally sold you out now here they are you had a prime minister in Egypt anything you asked for it will be done now they are in your hands God wants to see your reaction like Seoul wanted to kill David chance him everywhere and here God puts all in the hands of David that David was saw was lying just sleeping and the sleep was so deep I believe David could have taken off his head and carried it home before solar even wake up and realize his head was gone but he didn't do it he didn't do it sometimes God who put the same people back in your hands to see your reaction be careful what you do justice said you made it for evil but God meant it for good God brought me here I had a few to save lives to save lives praise be to God so it's okay don't weep I forgive you you are my brothers I love you anyhow but it was a Hearton for them and the Israel ended up in Egypt life was good because Joseph was a man that was respecting oh these are justice brothers oh this is the family they were treated very well five star treatment but a Bible says that day arose a pharaoh who didn't know if we didn't know Joseph and that was where everything just and there is nothing permanent in this life don't put your trust in anything under the Sun let your trust again be ain't nothing by the Word of God put God first in your education put God first in your way put God first if wanna do business put God first whatever you do put God first by putting God first you would have put yourself first and if you put God second you know where you put yourself not even second you know you know even get the last position Cheng's just changed it just flipped over and then all of a sudden they're people that loved and respected them just ten against them why because the Pharaoh said this before the weather multiply and the way that they are so slow financially they are getting rich if we will just let them go one day they are going to take this country we have to stop them so he told ya pass muskets you know what give them more job to do make sure they work and work and work don't give them rest and as a matter of I you know what reduce the ration so it will be so tired by the time they get home they have no family life they will just get woman go to bed straight by the time they wake up it's time to get to come back to wake and he saw that it was not working the people was so multiplying nothing was working because the midwives you know what when you see and and an Israelite whom I give him back squeeze the baby to death but the Bible says they feared God and they would not do it Pharaoh caused the midwives I thought I instructed you people why have you guys disobeyed my commandment my command and they said Oh Pharaoh okay we have not disobeyed you but this Hebrew woman and not like the Egyptian our Egyptian woman they will shout and shout and shout for this for you to the baby's coming by this ones they are very strong they will just be walking around and before away the baby has come praise be to God so so okay then the King issues a decree you know what kill every male born child every male buncher if it's a baby girl let her be girly if it's a man slaughter him and it was at this time it was at this time that God gave Amram and Jochebed a child and Jochebed kept this little child hit him till he she couldn't hide him anymore and then the Babu says she made a basket weave a basket just try to make it a little comfortable and then just went implicit or denial Emeril said there wasn't enough water in the Nile to drown Moses and awarded enough crocodiles to eat him up why because that life had a god-given purpose and let me tell you this they promised it until the purpose of God for your life is fulfilled you cannot go anywhere there is nowhere you can leave this earth you can't die I don't care what the devil does God's giving purpose in your life would surely come to pass nothing can stop it and on the Nile the crocodiles could eat a team or it could never get wrong and then here comes Pharaoh adora and they they had recorded a today that made sevens to come and take a bath and they saw this basket floating on the sea out of curiosity they weren't in the soul he said little handsome boy and right away she just fell in love with this little that connection that instant connection that she couldn't just go away and Moses sister who was hiding to see what's been going just came on the scene we honor the story his mother ended up taking care of him and during this time the mother kept telling him you are not an Egyptian you are born a deliverer you are hip you have won a deliverer you are here bro you I mean keep pumping it in his head mother's you have a special place in the kingdom of God don't leave everything in the hands of the father's mother's you have a first place when the child is growing just think about it you have the child all day it's when a child gets of age then they begin to get closer to the daddy and daddy begins to teach them changed you know a boy child should know and what of you you have a special place a special place and make use of it to pray to take the children and that means you yourself should be reading the word because how do you teach the child if you are not reading and you don't even know what you're talking about praise be to God so when a child became of age now the mother carries him to his mother now in quotes but I have brought your son to you and then he/she no name took him to the palace Moses had the best of the best in life the best of the bests the Pharaoh looked at him and even loved him more than his own son and instead of grooming him to become the next Pharaoh there was how much love he had for him he had a the best education the best life I mean energy you can think of but still Moses was not happy a child of God you never be happy with anything other than the way I don't care how much prosperity you have I don't care how much of the things of this world you have I'm not saying that you can't get them genuinely people are quite well genuinely and God gives who say that you're of God are poor no God blesses his children with with with wealth you can have genuine wealth you can have all these but you know what if your life is not right with God that emptiness is the day you will never be happy you have all that but you are not happy you know there is something lacking in your life there is something missing and it was so with Moses oh the treatment he had he was still not happy he would looked with the window Pharaoh looked through the window and then he sees those slaves because them slaves my brothers and what have you nicknames but Moses looks to the same window as affirmative God said and he says these are people I'm gonna spend eternity with you one day these are my brothers and sisters as a matter of fact I don't belong to this palace I belong there I'm supposed to be there with them Moses was never satisfied and as the story goes one day moves it so that's the worse an israelite an egyptian fightning and then he stepped in a killed Egyptian and buried him in the Sun thank you oh my but my brother has my back the next time he saw two is the last fighting he stepped in you guys are brothers why should we fight against ourselves I said oh you think you can kill me the way you killed the Egyptian then he realized that oh it was no longer a secret it was no longer a secret they say you know what I have to run away before Pharaoh six my head and then he took off ended up in the media why he got married I was taking care of his for the lost sheep excuse me and one day he was on the field taking care of the sheep and then when he turned he saw that there was this bush there was some fire but yes the grass was not consumed as I said Moses had the best of education and he looked at it I have never seen this before I learned physics I learned chemistry I leant biology but in all of these classes they never taught me this what principle is this and as he got closer to see what was going on then he had Moses Moses say yes I am the God of your father's the birth of Abraham and of Isaac both told him the granules turning on it's a holy ground take off your shoes they took off he shoots and he bow started trembling he was so afraid to praise be to God God make him by the back son and he told him I have had the cry of my people and have remembered the Covenant I had with your forefathers and I am come down to deliver them praise be to God and I'm sending you Moses oh then mosey started giving excuses how do you assess Tamra how you couldn't talk how I mean giving us Jesus here and there and God asked Moses what is in your hand I said is the road true it down it true it down there right away it became a snake and the Bible says he fled sneaking somebody something everybody feels that animal in in in in Africa where I come from when the men kill the snake you go ten minutes later when you come you see how to beat them flatten it you asked who did it ever tell you the woman did it yes after the man killed a snake the owner come a flatten it on the ground everybody's just Nick Moses fled one time I had a magazine I'll sit in the magazine and III saw the five things Americans feared the most and snake was number three public speaking was number one the fear of snake was number three oh I hadn't got for my citizenship yet when I saw it but Americans fear snakes I just said to myself oh I'm an American already yeah so he fled and God said go back when he fled he may have such himself o mystic I'll get a loss from the bush let this one go God says go back implicate yourself what go back and pick the snake grow back and pick it pick it from the tail sometimes we think he just came right away the snake was lying down as a stick and he just came and picked it I believe there was a lot of dancing that went on in the bush and finally when he got ahold of the chill returning to their road again oh wow I don't know what are they had moccasin knows this but I will just take it and I'll mark where the head is make sure it doesn't come anywhere near my body and go sir put your hand in your amp it take it out it became leprous so put it back and it was healed upon all the science God gave him Moses still was not ready to go to Egypt but finally finally he had to go now fast forward what do you want us to was too much on the story Moses finds himself in Egypt would air on his brother and then Pharaoh would not allow the children of Israel to go because he looks at the skyscrapers and rebuilding projects what do you doing in this people should go who is going to do all this they are not going and then placed upon plates clicks upon plates can I might fight against God and win no place upon plates and then finally when every firstborn child how to die including Pharaohs own son and every beast that was when Moses was given the express permission to cut it a chiller of Israel out of Egypt because they in Egypt had had more than enough everybody was crying Pharaoh let these people go let him go see what trouble has come has befallen us and finally they were let go and in the wilderness as they will go they go to the Red Sea when the god day the Red Sea was before them here was a mountain a mountain they didn't know what was going to happen but that was the direction God led them by day he led them with a pilaf in a pillar of cloud and by night in the pillar of fire brought them through that angle and before they realized the Egyptian army were behind them with their chariots of war Pharaoh and his people coming after them because he didn't believe what he did it was the hand of God the mighty hand of God so they were coming to take them back and when the chair of Israel saw them coming with a dust billowing oh then they started crying and shouting Oh Moses Moses Moses we told you leave us alone to serve these people in peace are there no graves in Egypt you have brought us to come and die in the wilderness Oh Moses you should have left us in peace was it not the same people who saw the hand of God and short while ago how God delivered them that the firstborn every Egyptian diet but not a single death was reported in the cup of Israel oh lord have mercy on us now sometimes we see the hand of God in our lives we see God in full oppression but in situations just happen and then we forget that we have a God we forget we think oh my goodness not have mercy on us we cry like the boo have no hope like people who do not have God not have mercy best that I shot him crying they have forgotten what God just did for them and remember the pillar of cloud was with them by day and by night the pillar of fire what more vindication of God we're looking for then when Moses tells us to look at him coming and there Moses pronounced judgment on them in advance that keep still keep still and fear ye not for these Egyptians you see ye shall see them no more never in your life he had already passed judgment and God was waiting on Moses and Moses was also waiting on God when bird was waiting on Moses to say anything Moses then and you're so so waiting on God most of the times we come to that place and God is waiting on us the angels are on duty the Bible says that the angel of the Lord ain't and encompass run about them that fear him and deliver them you don't have to see to believe the Word of God is true and if you believe that is the Word of God God keeps the sweat and the angels are day they are on duty waiting for you to give a command like when Elijah and his seventh when his servant went out and saw the Syrian army only a Cheerios of war he won tonight Otis must muster oh I'd love at last what shall we do they said what say come and see there are charters of war all around and then Elijah just left English I came so he just prayed and asked God to open his eyes to see and when God opened his eyes he saw the chariots of war praise be to God angels angels on chariots of war ready ready for action and that is how it is that is how it is that you are always around waiting for a word of instruction and then God is waiting for you to speak and then you get to that place and you're also with you not go to speak and God shouts at Moses Moses what I watching for what are you waiting for what do you have in your hand set a road it says stretch it over the sea and let it and and and tell the children of Israel to go to the sea and then he stretched it and praise be to God they see straight wherever the wind just came blowing from just started blowing just blew through the Red Sea and just putter in it too - and I was a hip hear a hip there and a dry ground and the churn of either just walked to the dry ground and a pillar of fire that was before them just moved from before them and went behind them and stood there the Egyptians even though they were looking at them they couldn't go the wooden cross there was a buffer between them and the children were just on their feet just hurrying up just hurried up and has their crust Pharaoh and his family yes jumped in chasing them not one of them Pharaoh - the last person all of them yes cut off in the midst of the sea there together with your chalice of war everyone on them go drown what are we talking about this morning why cry why cry speak Moses was crying to go and one said why are you crying to me speak and tell them to go forward why cry when Joshua was worrying against the enemies and he got to a place and the Sun was going down and he needed to finish those enemies he just turned around looked at the Sun he just spoke to the Sun you know what I have duty to do stay where you are don't move look at the moon since they right there praise be to God there is power my goodness we are children of God when you get to know who you are and when you stand in the scheme of God's program my goodness the devil is afraid of you a child of God you don't have to fear the devil if you have believed this message of Melaka four five and six and you fear Devils you need to work faster he spoke to the son can you imagine that God created everything and put them as any way he wanted them to be and here comes the son of God they what God has put he just he just interferes with that order and they obey Him when Micaiah when he thought a king of Israel when they wanted to go to I guess I'm of Gilead and I came and prophesied against him the king of Israel was so angry with him and he commanded his servants to put Micaiah in prison and feed him with with the bread of affliction and water of affliction till he comes back from war and you know how wicked that king was very wicked King coming tip of his head what did make I tell him McHale was not crying Oh King I'm sorry for promised a lien against you or forgive me no no no he told him if you go and you come back then the Lord has not spoken by me we are children of buddy who should speak with authority we up my goodness look we have not believed cunningly devised fables it is the Word of God does see of the Lord it is not the weight of man it is the Word of God why cry why cry speak there was a little girl I come from Donna some weighing down at Emma there was a little girl there was this guy who was always monitoring hey she didn't know there was somebody monitoring her one day when her parents left the house this beast of a man just went in and locked the door behind and when the girl ten think it was one of her parents that worked in so that was the total stranger right away she said I command you to go blind in Jesus name right away he went blind and then he just started looking for it for his way out he went blind right there and then and today to take advantage of him why cry that would have been a very good moment just a shouting Oh daddy mommy and what are they why cry Moses why are you crying what are you waiting on speak and tell them to put a move on and in our individual lives in our family lives in our church lives whatever life it is you get to that moment of experience where you either choose to cry or you choose to speak but we would always get there I don't care how long it takes there is that moment in the life of a child of God why you would come before the well see in your life it could be sickness you may go to the hospital and I don't know tell you know what you have cancer they have different different stages I don't know what even the stage is that and this stage here there is nothing medical science can do about it so you know what well just send you home to win die it has left for you to either believe what the doctor is saying but and do nothing about the situation go and pity yourself cry all nights have sleepless nights and then die or you can just base your hope on the Word of God and you will never be put to shame because the Bible says he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was laid upon him and by His stripes we are healed praise be to God Oh wonderful we are seven eleven God by His stripes we are healed there is no cancer that can stand the blood of Jesus there is no disease there is no sickness there is no infirmity there is no charm there is no spell that can stand the blood of Jesus he did not only die so we would have salvation he also died so would enjoy good health and save him in good health praise be to God when the children is not good - I'm of Gilead Kadesh Barnea and Moses sent 12 generals to burn in spite a promised land and come back and and give that before the feedback when they went they saw that indeed the land was rich the land was blessed and they took evidence of the land and brought it back when they saw it they started rejoicing oh praise God praise God this is indeed that Landis is flowing with milk and honey that line is blessed the line is blessed and they're right away ten of them say but you know what we can't take the land so why there were giants the people there are giants we were like grasshoppers before them they are big people men of valois we can't take the land or then the people started wailing wailing where praise be to God God would always have a witness there were two just shot and kill em and what were their basing their promises on they were basing their promises on the word we don't care how big they are we don't care how tall they are we don't care how sophisticated your aunt's of where the answer for all we care is that God has given us the land and the land is ours we are going to take it anyhow so you know what you get that moment don't look at the size of the storm don't look if you look at the size of the storm that devil's going to take our money don't shoot the devil appraised by fear god of Chris with fates if the devil can get you to panic get afraid just guess what you've lost it stand your ground stand your ground when the devil comes let him come when you booster was brewing ten times you know Turin you know how children can be here sometimes in school I used to remember if if if one child beasts another one and because every time they want to come and meet him when they just beat you once oh and you know for you you are an easy easy easy what about easy much every time is it pray thank you they will just come even when you're holding your peace you'll find a way to beat you up there only turn to stop its when they come and there is an opposition I remember my pastor back home was telling me a story one time inside you go to school and every time you come home crying and it's not I would ask but what happened again except I wised everybody beat you he said do you know that the kid is part of the body then itit is part of the body that in a fight there are no rules now you use what you have so if you can use and you sort it so he went as usual then I came again hit him once hit him again then he just caught their hand put in his mouth then yesterday shouting put a hand on his head yes running the following day he came they got had a bandage on his hand his finger and then he never came close and anybody that came close to my pasta you tell him oh don't go there oh they're back and bite the guy come by don't go there so the only time that devil will let you alone is when there is an opposition don't be an easy pick for the devil I don't care how many times you fall when I was your head down with your legs up get up and keep going on praise be to God where we fall and how many times you fall do not define who I don't care how many times you fall the Bible says the just shall fall seven times rise again praise be to God it doesn't mean that you just have to go sinning as soon as you know the Bible says the worshiper once paged should have had no more conscience or desire for sin keep your distance away we have been set free there is no reason for us to be in bondage we are free true sons and daughters of the Bible says we are already seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus it's not that we are going to be we are already tell the devil that in this day and age there are men and women that can still live godly in christ jesus why try do not look at the stones look at his word what does his words say in closing one time one pasta had a doctor friend and this doctor friend it's the hot second so through their conversations the pastor said I would want to see how you do it so he arranged and then when he had one heart operation to do he invited his friend the pastor to come home so he came they dressed in their long robes the pasta dressing his also they put on the mask and what have you they entered in there and then they performed the operation and normally when they do the heart oppression when they are done with the operation I'm not a doctor I'm not a surgeon but from the story they said he would tap just tap the hearts you tap the heart and then the heart you just start pumping you just start pumping so the doctor told the pastor everything so they went in and then had the operation and when they're finished with oppression the doctor tapped the huts of the patients he didn't respond so what it tapped it again thank you to stop pumping it in our school this is a very good place for you to put your hands on your head and it's not crying because you know he's dead now but I am bringing our minds to something here this morning let's catch it so when heat up a delicious heart and they had to no pump the pastor said he come close to the patient's ear this was a man that was dead on the operating table dead he come closed his ears and he told him tell your heart to beat again and as soon as his wristband in his years tell you how to beat again his heart just started pumping praise be to God now why cry speak think about it catch it now this is a man that is dead on the operating table amen that is dead on your preaching table and you have a doctor a human being a doctor who has done to the end of everything he ever learned about oppression in his books he got to the end of it no solution he didn't give up and then he goes to this man who is dead dead not alive dead and he tells him tell you how to beat again and that dead man took those West and his blood that they're pumping again now think about it we are children of God we are not dead we are living sons and daughters of God and we have not believed the worst of men we have believed at a pulse of God the Word of God thus saith the Lord the word that created the heavens and the earth he created them by his poking with their own letting God critter with his hands was meant so how hot we how hot we the living cells and daughters of God to take the Living Word of God and speak praise be to God how hot we if a dead man can just take the word of a man and then spring back to life how should we they live in sons and daughters of God take the Living Word of God and spring back white cry praise be to God why cry there are several situations you are going to get me in this life never tell yourself oh I am a small boy oh I am a small girl oh I am small no there is no small
