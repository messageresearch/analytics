[2:50] Oh, and I've been
[2:53] watching and I've been
[2:58] waiting just in day
[3:03] now. His face I'll see.
[3:11] I remember that song when I first came
[3:13] into the
[3:14] message and it's still sweet.
[3:19] Amen. Glad to see everybody here. Amen.
[3:21] By the grace of the Lord. Ain't God good
[3:24] to us. We're not going to prolong the
[3:26] time because we got communion. We're
[3:28] just going to go right into the word of
[3:30] God. Uh how many was blessed this
[3:33] morning? I truly was blessed by the
[3:35] grace of God
[3:37] myself. Uh without the Lord, where would
[3:39] we be? And that song is so appropriate.
[3:42] Just any day now. Oh my God. Woo. It'll
[3:47] be worth It's been worth it. I was
[3:50] telling my daughters uh coming down uh
[3:53] here tonight uh we've come too far.
[4:00] We've come too
[4:02] far to quit, to give
[4:06] up. Amen. We have invested all of our
[4:11] lives. We've made a lot of mistakes.
[4:15] But thank God for the grace of God.
[4:18] Amen. I'm so grateful for that. I don't
[4:21] know what to do. Amen. We're going to
[4:25] start at Daniel 12 and
[4:27] 10. By the grace of God, a I'm still
[4:32] excited. I was that uh those songs our
[4:35] brother sang this morning. Uh I I tell
[4:38] you what, that's just something about
[4:39] it. I just love that. And uh you know
[4:42] it's it's
[4:45] amazing what simplicity can
[4:50] do. You
[4:52] know it's just like uh
[4:55] Psalms
[4:57] 23. You can't add nothing to it. You
[5:01] can't take nothing away from it's
[5:03] perfect as it
[5:05] is. Amen. Amen. I know there's probably
[5:08] many people have tried to add something.
[5:10] You can't. And it covers everything.
[5:11] It's
[5:15] finished. Amen. Daniel
[5:19] 12:10. Many shall be
[5:21] purified and made
[5:24] white and tried, but the wicked shall do
[5:29] wickedly, and none of the wicked shall
[5:32] understand, but the wise shall
[5:35] understand. Oh, I love this. Amen.
[5:39] Proverbs 9
[5:46] and1 and from there we'll go to
[5:51] Luke the 6th
[5:55] chapter. But Proverbs 9 and1 says wisdom
[5:58] hath built her house. She hath heuned
[6:03] out her seven pillows.
[6:07] Now that's a lesson in itself. But um
[6:11] let us turn to Luke the 6th
[6:13] chapter.
[6:26] Amen. Luke 6:4 uh 8. I believe that's
[6:31] where I want to go.
[6:36] Let's let's start at the 46th verse. And
[6:39] why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not
[6:43] the things which I
[6:46] say? Whosoever cometh to me and heareth
[6:49] my
[6:50] sayings and doeth them, I will show you
[6:54] to whom he is
[6:56] like. He is like a man built a house and
[7:00] dig deep and laid the foundation on a
[7:05] rock. And when the flood arose, the
[7:08] streams beat beheimately upon the
[7:11] house, and could not shake it, for it
[7:16] was
[7:17] founded upon a rock.
[7:20] But he that heareth and doeth it not is
[7:24] like a man without a foundation built
[7:28] upon the
[7:29] earth against which the stream did beat
[7:33] veheimly and immediately it fell and the
[7:37] ruins of the house was great. Let us
[7:41] pray. Heavenly Father God we come before
[7:44] you Lord. We thank you for your grace
[7:46] and your mercy. Forgive us, Father, for
[7:50] anything we may have said or
[7:52] done. Lord, we pray that you would just
[7:54] bless each and every heart here tonight
[7:56] or this evening. Give us what we stand
[7:59] in need of, and we'll be careful to give
[8:01] you the praise, glory, and honor. In
[8:03] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You
[8:06] may be seated. We were
[8:11] late coming
[8:13] in. I call myself resting just a little
[8:17] bit.
[8:19] And in that time of rest, while the
[8:22] communion bread was being
[8:24] baked, it
[8:26] burned. So I had to do it all over
[8:30] again. And so that's what we what caused
[8:33] us to be late. And for whatever reason,
[8:37] the second batch took a long little
[8:39] longer than the first basically because
[8:42] I wanted to get here on the grace grace
[8:44] of God. But I tell you what, you can't
[8:46] hurry God. I thought if I turned it up a
[8:49] little high,
[8:51] it Yes, it did
[8:53] get it baked
[8:57] quickly. But you know, I thank God for
[8:59] his grace and his mercy. He always bring
[9:03] it right.
[9:05] We're not supposed to work in haste.
[9:08] Every time we do that, we get in
[9:10] trouble.
[9:11] And so the Lord showed me that because
[9:14] here I was I totally forg I know we were
[9:17] having communion had not my daughter say
[9:20] well and my wife and they were telling
[9:21] me well you need to make the communion
[9:23] bread. I'm like oh Lord bless his name.
[9:26] But anyway, we're here
[9:28] tonight and we realize by the grace of
[9:31] God that uh a lot of us don't like being
[9:36] the process of
[9:39] purification. Amen. You know, because
[9:42] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[9:44] from all unrighteousness. Amen. But in
[9:47] our day, uh God's
[9:50] purification system is fire. Amen. He is
[9:55] the fire
[9:57] that baptizes your soul, cleanses you
[10:00] with fire. Amen. Understand this. And
[10:05] then we read this morning where the
[10:07] Bible said, "Think it not strange when
[10:09] you fall into uh the fiery trials try
[10:12] you." Those tests and trials that comes
[10:17] to try your character because that's
[10:20] what we want. Amen. Brother Brandham
[10:22] said that's the only thing that will
[10:23] take to the other side. Amen. Is
[10:26] character. Amen. I read the scripture
[10:29] this morning how I mean this evening how
[10:32] Amen. The Bible tells us, Amen. that uh
[10:35] this man who was wise dug deep. Amen. He
[10:40] he was wanting to make sure that his
[10:44] foundation was secure. Amen. Because I
[10:46] don't care how fancy the house could be
[10:49] or would be, if the foundation is shaky,
[10:54] it just takes a little time for that uh
[10:57] house to show that the foundation uh
[11:01] wasn't set just right. If it's not
[11:04] placed on something solid, something,
[11:06] you know, now we're finding, amen, that
[11:10] many houses right now are literally
[11:13] falling into sink holes. Amen. because
[11:16] they didn't do enough
[11:17] research on the land in which they were
[11:20] building the house or the building or
[11:22] the road. And God knows that's got to be
[11:26] an experience.
[11:28] Amen. For you to fall. I remember the
[11:31] fell in Florida. I thought to myself, he
[11:32] must have done something really bad to
[11:35] be in his bed and the whole earth
[11:36] swallows him up. I don't know. But that
[11:39] had to be a horror. Amen. For that
[11:43] experience. And they couldn't find him.
[11:45] They never did. But nevertheless,
[11:47] there's something greater than that
[11:49] sinkhole. We call it hell. Amen. Now, we
[11:53] know that we're living. This is the
[11:55] subject part
[11:56] two. When tried in the fire, because I
[12:00] want you to understand that the trials
[12:03] are there to perfect you. Amen. Or to
[12:07] bring that perfection to a place where
[12:10] it can be seen. Amen. Brother B said,
[12:13] "We have everything in us already."
[12:16] That's right. What we need is already
[12:18] there for the rapture. Amen. But it
[12:22] takes something to pull that out of you.
[12:26] Now, I'm going tell you, for those of us
[12:27] who married, like I said, and my wife is
[12:30] not here, but I've said it in her
[12:31] presence many times. Before I got
[12:33] married, I thought I was ready for the
[12:34] rapture.
[12:39] It's the truth. She probably thought
[12:42] that, too. But you see, when you get
[12:44] these two rocks rubbing together, there
[12:47] are things, Amen. that's there you
[12:49] didn't even know was there. Amen. Oh,
[12:52] it's the truth. But it's a good thing
[12:53] because what happens is after a while,
[12:56] both of those edges become smooth. Amen.
[13:00] Fitly join together. Come on, somebody.
[13:03] It's there. It's God's program. It's the
[13:06] way God ordained it. Amen.
[13:09] Now, you know, we look at this thing and
[13:11] I I I tell people, I said, "Listen, when
[13:13] when God chose you, he he knew the exact
[13:17] plan he was going to work with you."
[13:19] There was no mistake. God don't have
[13:21] slip ups. Amen. God knew exactly what it
[13:25] was going to take to perfect you. And if
[13:27] you don't want to be perfect, and if you
[13:29] don't want to be like God, stop asking
[13:31] him to be. Amen.
[13:34] Because you ask God, he answers. Amen.
[13:38] All right. Oh, it doesn't come in the
[13:40] flavor that you like, but it comes in
[13:44] the flavor that God knows suits you
[13:46] best. Amen. Remember, every decision
[13:49] that God makes for us, we benefit from
[13:52] it.
[13:55] That's why we go to him in prayer. Lord,
[13:57] teach us, lead us, guide us, show us,
[13:59] amen, what we need to do, how we need to
[14:02] act. Come on, somebody. Lead us. Amen.
[14:06] And like I said this morning, if you're
[14:08] disconnected, how you going to know what
[14:10] God plans are for you?
[14:14] Amen. The Bible said that wisdom built
[14:16] her house. She have heuned out seven
[14:19] pillars. And you understand these
[14:21] pillars of stone and realize by the
[14:23] grace of God. Amen. Every church age,
[14:26] like I said this morning, had their
[14:28] trials. They had their tests. And glory
[14:33] to God, God selected you to come in the
[14:38] worst of all ages.
[14:42] Come on, somebody. The best for last.
[14:46] Amen. Because he has confidence
[14:49] [Music]
[14:50] in you. Is that right? Remember I told
[14:53] you that story? Brother Brandham told
[14:54] that story about how the the young man
[14:56] was wounded in the war. I love that.
[14:58] that that has been really coming to me
[15:00] more and more and more because he was
[15:02] wounded and he had amnesia. Is that
[15:04] right? And while he was on the train,
[15:06] he's looking out the window. The train
[15:07] stops at a depot and all of a sudden
[15:11] something happened. The man sees
[15:13] something in the distance that seemed
[15:15] familiar
[15:17] and he begins to get up and walk off the
[15:19] plane. And the the the man responsible
[15:22] for him said, "Uh uh, should I stop
[15:23] him?" "No, let him go on." And what
[15:26] happened? and he kept walking, turning,
[15:27] and everything else. And everything
[15:29] began to become more familiar. That's
[15:32] what it is about the word. That's why
[15:34] you can say amen to things that this
[15:37] message says because now you're
[15:39] beginning to remember where you came
[15:42] from and where you're going. Sin brought
[15:45] this amnesia to your mind. But the word
[15:48] of God came to erase that amnesia. taken
[15:52] away that you can clearly see who you
[15:55] are. Amen. And what you come for
[16:00] Hallelujah. Is that all right?
[16:03] So that's what it is. We we come to be
[16:05] tried and it's the greatest love story
[16:08] ever, ever, ever, ever. And it is all
[16:11] about love from Genesis to Revelation.
[16:14] and and know that God, Amen, by the time
[16:17] we get to heaven, he won't have to ever
[16:19] worry about you not loving him. Amen.
[16:22] He'll never have he'll never have
[16:24] another Lucifer. Yes, sir. Come on.
[16:26] Realize realize Lucifer was not
[16:30] connected.
[16:32] Had he been a son,
[16:35] hallelujah, he would have had the
[16:37] creative ability. Amen. Amen. He had
[16:40] everything but that. Amen. and God comes
[16:44] along. You as a fallen individual gives
[16:47] you the Holy Ghost, which is a creative
[16:51] ability. It is Amen. God's creation.
[16:54] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. See, he was he was
[16:57] he was a he was a beast. Call it what
[17:00] you want to cherub him, serap him,
[17:02] whatever you call him. He was a covering
[17:04] angel, but he didn't have the gene of
[17:06] God in his soul. Amen.
[17:12] You hear what I'm saying? Amen. So, look
[17:14] at all of those eons of years. The Bible
[17:17] doesn't even tell how long he was there,
[17:20] but all it took was a season and a time
[17:24] and he was made manifest.
[17:27] Amen. So, why would she? Why? Oh my
[17:30] goodness. I never thought he. I never
[17:33] thought she. I never thought they. But
[17:36] look at the whole scope of the message.
[17:38] Yeah. Amen. All these years, people who
[17:41] had programs building churches all over
[17:43] the place are now turning. Why? Because
[17:46] it's the season. Yeah. Amen. It is the
[17:49] season of the rapture. Come on,
[17:51] somebody. It is the season of the
[17:53] rapture. That's why it must happen. But
[17:57] at the same time, you got those who are
[17:59] hungry and thirsting for God, wanting
[18:02] more. God, give me more. Give me more.
[18:05] There's no turning back. There's no
[18:07] turning around. And it is decision
[18:09] making time. You're going to Listen, I
[18:12] was telling the devil, I talk to him
[18:13] like a natural man sometime. I said,
[18:15] "Listen, I want you to know I wasn't
[18:17] created for hell." Amen. I wasn't
[18:20] created for the reason of the laws. I'm
[18:22] not going there. I'm not yours. So, you
[18:25] might as well forget it.
[18:28] That's good, brother. Amen.
[18:30] Right. My sheep hears my voice and a
[18:33] stranger will not follow. So why on
[18:36] earth I am going to let you talk to me
[18:39] when you already fallen and lost. Amen.
[18:42] You can't show me the way. Hallelujah.
[18:45] The way has already been made and
[18:47] revealed.
[18:48] So we're looking at a time and and it is
[18:51] a decision time. But you got to
[18:53] understand you and I cannot exempt these
[18:56] trials. First of all, God said if you're
[18:59] going to follow me, take up your cross.
[19:00] That's right. Amen. Is that right? Amen.
[19:02] It is a way of crucifixion. And it is a
[19:05] way of sacrifice.
[19:08] And like I say, a real sacrifice hurt.
[19:11] Amen. Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. If
[19:15] I asked if you got a million dollars and
[19:16] and I asked you for a hundred, that
[19:18] didn't hurt you
[19:21] none. Y'all hear what I'm saying? It got
[19:24] to hurt. It's got to be a big
[19:27] portion in order for it to become a
[19:29] sacrifice. And I showed you how it was
[19:32] with Abraham. God asked Abraham for his
[19:35] very life. Amen.
[19:39] When he asked for Isaac, right? That was
[19:41] Abraham existence.
[19:44] Without that Isaac, Abraham could not
[19:47] have continued because Isaac was the
[19:49] promised seed. If God was to take that
[19:52] away and not repair it or return it,
[19:54] Abraham would have been a man who would
[19:57] have not been a father of many nations.
[20:01] But God could not come back. Go back on
[20:03] his on his word. His void word could not
[20:06] come back void. But he had to test
[20:09] Abraham. Let me tell y'all something so
[20:11] you can understand what Calvary was all
[20:15] about. It was such a love for God gave a
[20:19] sacrifice that hurt. Yes, sir. Amen.
[20:23] Y'all hear what I'm saying? He literally
[20:26] risked his own life, if I could put it
[20:29] that way. He but he you know God can't
[20:32] die. The spirit God is God. But he
[20:34] placed himself in a human body so that
[20:37] you can get an understanding on how deep
[20:41] the love of God is for those whom he
[20:45] redeemed.
[20:47] Thank you Lord.
[20:49] He basically came and he worked with
[20:51] something that was literally saying if
[20:54] if Jesus don't that's what brother
[20:57] Brandham said. If he wasn't able to
[20:59] claim it, he said all would have been
[21:01] lost. Amen.
[21:03] All would have been lost. But because
[21:05] Christ died for us, it was a love
[21:09] affair. It literally hurts
[21:13] emotions that God God got feelings.
[21:15] Amen.
[21:18] Can you imagine the spirit God looking
[21:21] at his son and he know his son has
[21:23] become sin and he pulls himself back and
[21:27] his son crying out my God my God why
[21:31] hast thou forsaken me. Y'all know how
[21:33] y'all how children do when you when you
[21:36] spank them or you you you judge them or
[21:38] you you do something and you know you
[21:40] got to do it and and they look at you as
[21:42] if you have done the the unforable sin.
[21:46] Are you just by mistake? Have you ever
[21:48] hit your child or done something by
[21:50] mistake or step on their toe and and the
[21:52] little baby look at you like what on you
[21:54] know it it brings a condemnation. It
[21:56] does something to you. But here was the
[21:59] son of God crying
[22:01] out but he had to do it.
[22:05] Can you imagine this pure love what it
[22:08] was feeling seeing his own son die. Now
[22:13] listen because brother Brandon said God
[22:15] had to pull back. Jesus went to Calvary
[22:18] as a man.
[22:20] Come on somebody. So you can see that
[22:23] was the the the first time since the the
[22:25] the the River Jordan that God had ever
[22:28] been separated from his son from his
[22:29] son. Oh, it was a historical thing. It
[22:33] was something that really, you know, you
[22:35] should really look into how important
[22:38] you are to him. Like the brother said
[22:41] not long ago, a third of heaven fell and
[22:43] God didn't move. But as soon as Adam
[22:46] fell, God come down and said, "Adam,
[22:48] Adam, why? Where are you? Where are you?
[22:51] Where are you?" Amen. There was such a
[22:53] connection. Amen. So listen, when we can
[22:56] see what God has done for us and is
[22:59] doing, let me tell you something. We
[23:01] cannot
[23:02] quit. You can't turn around. This is not
[23:06] the season. And I'm going to show you in
[23:08] just a
[23:09] moment. But wisdom is known. Wisdom is
[23:12] known. Understand the Bible says in
[23:15] Isaiah 28:16, "Therefore, thus said the
[23:17] Lord God, behold, I lay in Zion for a
[23:21] foundation a stone, a tried stone." In
[23:26] other words, Christ was tried
[23:28] for you. He was tested in every manner.
[23:31] The prophet of God said he was tempted
[23:33] in every manner but without sin.
[23:37] said he even got sick that he could be a
[23:40] high priest that would be able to be
[23:43] touched by the feelings of our
[23:44] infirmities. Come on, somebody. That's
[23:48] more than enough.
[23:50] More than enough so that he can
[23:52] understand your cry and your moans and
[23:55] your groans and your agony and and all
[23:57] of the things that And let me tell you
[23:59] something. I don't know nobody right now
[24:01] who's not going through trials. I mean,
[24:04] right now the trials and tests are so
[24:08] great, if you don't know God, you'll
[24:11] practically lose your mind. Amen.
[24:18] Come on, somebody. That's where the
[24:19] battle
[24:20] is. That's where the battle is. Amen.
[24:24] And if you're not having any,
[24:25] something's wrong. Devil got you.
[24:27] Hallelujah. You should listen. I don't
[24:30] know about you, but I think I fight not
[24:33] just my demons, but every demon that the
[24:35] word of God castes out in here come by
[24:37] my
[24:40] house. Y'all have no
[24:45] idea. But it's really bad when they
[24:47] stand by your prayer spot trying to stop
[24:49] you from praying. That's when it's
[24:51] rough. Yes, sir.
[24:56] A stone tried, he tested. And like I
[24:59] said, the only reason why you and I
[25:00] going to make heaven is because we were
[25:02] in him. It'll never be because of your
[25:04] merit or how good you were and all that,
[25:06] even though we love him and we keep his
[25:08] commandments, every man fell short.
[25:11] Amen.
[25:13] Except him. Is that right? The Bible
[25:16] said we are accepted in the beloved. If
[25:19] you're not in the beloved, you're not
[25:21] accepted. Hallelujah. And the only way
[25:23] that you could be in him is that you
[25:25] came out from him. Hallelujah. Amen.
[25:29] So wisdom, the Bible said, Amen. A tri
[25:32] stone, a precious stone, a sure
[25:34] foundation, and he that believeth shall
[25:36] not make haste. In other words, you're
[25:38] not going to build in a
[25:40] hurry. A real good builder is one who
[25:43] will build with
[25:46] precision, making sure, you know, like I
[25:50] said, you know, Noah couldn't cut any
[25:51] corners. He could not cut a a a limb or
[25:55] tree or whatever it was. a little uh a
[25:58] eighth of an inch short and then put
[25:59] some putty there. He couldn't do it. He
[26:02] had to be a
[26:04] precise builder. He had the measurement
[26:07] had to be exactly the way God so is it
[26:10] with you. Amen. And God is building a
[26:13] house in you. Character is being built.
[26:16] Is that right? Peter tells us of the
[26:19] perfect character. He wasn't talking
[26:21] about something outside of Christ. He's
[26:23] telling us what was in Christ that made
[26:26] him Christ. And he said, "If these same
[26:29] characteristics be in you," he said,
[26:31] "you won't be barren. You won't fall."
[26:34] Amen. Amen. Right? And you won't forget
[26:37] where you come from. Right? So listen,
[26:40] let's move on because we're living in a
[26:43] time when you we come to this message.
[26:45] Hey, y'all remember that? For those of
[26:47] us, some of us, you know, was Hallelujah
[26:49] Boulevard for years.
[26:52] It's true. It was Hallelujah. Then after
[26:56] a while it was like oh Lord help me
[26:58] Jesus right.
[27:03] It's the truth. It's the truth. God
[27:05] protected us and you know gave us all
[27:07] the sweet stuff. Then all of a sudden
[27:08] the storms came start coming and testing
[27:11] and trying you and all of that. Amen. It
[27:14] wasn't from next door. It was in house.
[27:17] Amen. Hallelujah. But that's just the
[27:20] way God designed it.
[27:22] fitly join those stones together, lively
[27:24] stones. You think you going to be in a
[27:26] church and not rub against one another
[27:28] every now and again, you are totally
[27:30] mistaken. God has these stones so
[27:32] rubbing together, sometimes at the end
[27:34] of the road, it'll be so like brother
[27:36] said, not even a razor blade can get
[27:38] between you. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[27:40] That's what he's saying. When he talk
[27:42] about that pyramid, he's talking about
[27:43] people. What the relationship this word
[27:46] would bring to us, Embrace us into a
[27:49] place, Amen. Nobody, no dirt, not even
[27:52] air can get between us. Amen. That's the
[27:55] way the bride's supposed to be.
[27:57] Amen. Revelations 3:18 says, "I
[27:59] counseledled thee to buy gold tried in
[28:02] the fire." So, you have been
[28:05] invited to be tried.
[28:09] Thank you, Lord. To be tried in the
[28:12] fire. Is that right? You've been invited
[28:14] to be tried in the fire. You say you're
[28:16] gold. So, let's prove it. Hallelujah.
[28:21] Tried in the fire that thou mayestth be
[28:24] rich and white rich right and white
[28:28] raignment that thou may be clothed and
[28:30] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[28:32] appear. Anoint thy eyes with eyes that
[28:34] thou may see. And we're living in a time
[28:37] when the Bible said, "Hey, be quickly to
[28:40] repent." Amen. That's it. That's why I
[28:43] said that's what give us victory. We
[28:45] make a plenty of mistakes, but we have
[28:47] the ability and the right to repent. And
[28:50] God gives us that repentance and then
[28:53] wipes it clean because he said if you
[28:55] confess your faults or confess your
[28:57] sins, he said, "I'll be faithful to
[28:59] forgive you of your sins and to cleanse
[29:01] you from all unrighteousness." That's
[29:03] what communion is all about. It's a
[29:06] memorial of what Christ has already done
[29:08] for us. And remember I told you what's
[29:11] so important about these little pieces
[29:13] of bread is because before I break the
[29:16] bread they were once it was one piece
[29:19] one bread so how can we not be connected
[29:24] right and understand it is bread without
[29:27] leavening
[29:30] that means I can't have these little
[29:31] things going on take a communion uh come
[29:34] on somebody make sure your heart is pure
[29:37] and clean there is no leavenning there.
[29:40] He said, "That's why some are sick.
[29:42] That's why some die or sleep." Come on.
[29:44] Amen. Under That's why some are weak
[29:48] because once the devil amen get you to
[29:50] to to deceive you that there is no
[29:54] leavenvening, he's got you in a position
[29:56] where he can work with you. All right.
[29:59] Okay. Let's move on. Now, when we look
[30:02] at this thing, Amen. You and I must
[30:04] understand. I'm going to be long
[30:05] tonight. Amen. because I I'm just going
[30:07] to read a few things and I want you to
[30:08] understand these tests and these trials
[30:11] come. Now, I I I'll be honest with
[30:14] you. I heard a song
[30:17] say
[30:19] Satan not
[30:22] only will cause you to forget who you
[30:26] are, but he'll also cause you to
[30:29] remember who you used to be.
[30:34] Oh, he'll bring things back to your
[30:35] mind. Amen. That done happened eons
[30:38] ago. Come on, somebody. And then try to
[30:42] bring a condemnation on you when you
[30:44] place it already under the blood. Amen.
[30:48] That's the devil's job.
[30:51] And you can't tell me he ain't good at
[30:55] it. He is good at it. Amen. But let's
[30:59] move on. We have to resist the devil.
[31:01] That's right. Amen. and say, like I
[31:03] said, we said this morning, sheep
[31:05] following that shepherd. One sheep, one
[31:07] sheep, one sheep, one sheep. You got the
[31:09] shepherd ahead. You got all the sheep
[31:11] behind the one sheep behind the other
[31:13] one. There ain't no sheep breaking line.
[31:15] There's no sheep in front of the
[31:16] shepherd. Everything is behind the
[31:18] shepherd. Amen. Come on, somebody. Cuz
[31:20] the shepherd, Jesus Christ, knows the
[31:22] way he leads us.
[31:25] Hallelujah. Now, listen what he says.
[31:27] Amen. In the message Jehovah Gyra, he
[31:30] said a Christian will always give you
[31:32] the benefit of the doubt. And of course,
[31:34] he pitches his tent toward the big times
[31:36] in Sodom and Gomorrah. Talking about
[31:39] Lot and
[31:41] backslid all he had was burnt up later.
[31:47] So to pitch your tent towards Sodom
[31:50] means eventually that's where you will
[31:52] end up. That's all Lot needed to do.
[31:55] Pitch his tent. start doing some of the
[31:58] things that they do in Sodom and the
[32:00] next thing you know you will be
[32:03] there. Am I making sense? Amen. Amen.
[32:06] Because you're different. You're
[32:08] different. You know you we we're we're
[32:10] born of God. We come from God and we go
[32:12] back to God. Amen. And he says, listen,
[32:14] all that he had, everything Lot worked
[32:17] for was burnt up in the fire. Amen. Just
[32:20] like every lukewarm believer will be,
[32:24] all your goods will be tried by fire and
[32:27] your works and it'll be burned. Amen.
[32:32] But then after Lot separated himself
[32:34] from Abraham, Abraham was dwelling in
[32:36] the land and God appeared to Abraham and
[32:38] told him that the whole land belonged to
[32:40] him after he separated from Lot. Is that
[32:45] right? All of it's yours. Look east,
[32:47] west, north, south. It's every bit
[32:50] yours. All belong to you. Walk through
[32:52] it. See what it look like. Oh, that's
[32:55] what the trouble with the Christians
[32:57] today. You are all hes of all things.
[33:00] Amen. See, it's all ours. Amen. But is
[33:04] not really clearly seen until we totally
[33:08] separate oursel. Oh, you being mean. No,
[33:11] sir. Don't you understand? Heaven and
[33:13] hell are separate. Amen. Yes, sir.
[33:18] Two different places, two kind of
[33:20] lifestyle. If you want to call the other
[33:22] one
[33:23] lifestyle, what they do in heaven is not
[33:26] what they doing in hell. And what they
[33:29] doing in hell is not what they doing in
[33:30] heaven. So if I came from heaven, why
[33:34] should not I want to do the things that
[33:35] in heaven instead of what's doing being
[33:38] done in hell? Amen.
[33:40] Come on. It is the truth. You look at
[33:44] this and that's what brother Brandham
[33:45] said. He said, "Whatever you doing now
[33:46] is what you're doing there. Whatever
[33:48] you're doing here is what you doing
[33:50] there. Wherever there is."
[33:53] Amen. Well, brother, if I bought a house
[33:57] or somebody give me a house, I go
[33:59] through every room in it. I'll do I go
[34:02] down in the basement. I go out in the
[34:04] garage. I want to know what I own.
[34:06] That's the way it was when I got saved.
[34:08] Y'all remember me saying that this
[34:09] morning? Very, these are God promises.
[34:12] So I just went went right through,
[34:15] claimed every one of them and they are
[34:17] mine. You know, it's just like getting
[34:19] into a great big arcade. Did you ever go
[34:22] into a big arcade? You look around, it's
[34:24] all belong to you. By one spirit, we are
[34:27] baptized into this big arcade. Every
[34:29] promise is yours. Something looks a
[34:31] little high. Get you a step ladder and
[34:34] get up into it. Look it over. It all
[34:37] belongs to you. Come on, somebody. I
[34:39] remember. Amen. When I first got my It
[34:41] was just apartment. we was living in.
[34:43] And I had never had one that had a loft.
[34:46] Amen. I pull that baby down and step by
[34:50] step cuz you know the devil always tell
[34:52] you something up there
[34:55] lurking
[34:57] something. Well, you going to look for
[34:59] the light to cut the light on first,
[35:01] right? Amen. But the devil always got
[35:03] you telling something, but you want to
[35:05] look up there to see what's there. I
[35:07] tell you what, that little place I moved
[35:09] out of down there in South uh South
[35:11] Carolina, whoever found it found a gold
[35:13] mine. I left all my good stuff down up
[35:15] in that loft. Totally forgot we had
[35:19] it. Oh my goodness. Amen. Something look
[35:22] a little high. Get you into a step
[35:24] ladder. Get into it. Look it over. It's
[35:26] all belong to you. Every promise is
[35:28] yours. Every promise is to the believer.
[35:31] Heir of all things all belong to you,
[35:33] folks. This is not supposed to stay
[35:36] here.
[35:37] I love what brother Brandham said. He
[35:39] said, "When I got saved, I started
[35:40] searching. I looked to see what was all
[35:43] in there. I wanted everything. I wanted
[35:46] to know what was mine. Divine healing,
[35:49] that's mine." Amen. Deliverance, that's
[35:52] mine. I I look, he said, "And when it
[35:54] was got when it if it's something too
[35:56] high, get on a stepladder. Lord, help me
[35:59] up here." Amen. So I can see what's mine
[36:01] so I can venture out into it.
[36:08] Oh my. That's the way the word is. You
[36:10] don't stay on the same level. You don't
[36:13] stay on the same level. Hello.
[36:15] Hallelujah. To stay on the same level is
[36:17] backsliding. Backsliding. Is that right?
[36:20] Backsliding mean you ain't going
[36:22] nowhere. You're just on the same you
[36:23] ain't you're not going forward. You're
[36:25] not going backwards. You're just there.
[36:27] That's what a backslider is. Right. So
[36:30] listen, we need to go forward. Amen.
[36:33] Don't be
[36:35] afraid. If the pillar of fire, if God is
[36:38] going before you, you don't have to fear
[36:40] anything. That's what he said. Joshua,
[36:42] fear not. Amen. I've given you the land.
[36:45] Amen. Hallelujah.
[36:49] But we have to stay with it is written.
[36:52] Whatever God says, it is written. Amen.
[36:55] We can't deviate from that because that
[36:58] is the only thing Satan will obey is the
[37:02] word of God. Amen. He has to. Lord, how
[37:07] will I know this? Now, I want you to
[37:08] show you something. I want to listen. I
[37:11] want you to listen quiet. God told
[37:13] Abraham said, "Go get a half a
[37:15] three-year-old and the sheep and so
[37:17] forth and two doves and cut them in the
[37:19] middle, but don't divide the birds." The
[37:21] birds were put in a hole. Now if you are
[37:24] spiritual understand the bird always uh
[37:28] always the sacrifice for healing. God
[37:31] changed from law to grace but healing
[37:34] has always been on the basis of faith.
[37:39] Think about that. Is that all right?
[37:42] Turn with me to Luke 17. I'm going there
[37:44] because I want you to understand I
[37:46] really believe this is what is going on
[37:49] right now.
[37:52] Luke
[37:53] 17. Is that all
[37:56] right? Let's go up to uh uh
[38:05] uh 28th verse. Likewise also as it was
[38:09] in the days of Lot, they did eat, they
[38:12] drank, they bought, they sold, they
[38:14] planted, they built it. Whatever age you
[38:16] ever seen it like that before.
[38:18] Everywhere you go, that's what they
[38:20] doing. But the same day that Lot went
[38:23] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[38:24] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[38:27] all. Even thus shall it be in the day
[38:30] when the son of man is revealed. Has the
[38:32] son of man been revealed? So it must be
[38:35] the day. Conditions are here. Is that
[38:38] right? He said in that day he which
[38:41] shall be on the housetop and his stuff
[38:44] in the house, let him not come down to
[38:46] take away. And he that is in the field,
[38:48] let him likewise not return back. What
[38:50] he saying? Don't be overcharged.
[38:54] Don't let stuff make you overcharged.
[38:58] Amen. You got to protect what and how
[39:00] you going to carry
[39:03] it. Y'all hear what I'm saying? I tell
[39:05] you what, if anybody know about stuff, I
[39:09] do. And I never knew I had so much stuff
[39:11] until I came to Iowa.
[39:14] I'm still trying to get rid of stuff.
[39:16] No, it's true. But the Bible says in the
[39:19] 32nd verse, remember Lot's wife? And I
[39:23] wish this was my original uh uh uh uh uh
[39:26] uh thing, but I heard a brother say,
[39:28] which I really believe it. He said, was
[39:30] he just warning us or was it a prophecy?
[39:33] Everything else is a prophecy.
[39:36] So re Lot's wife must have been a
[39:38] prophecy, a hidden thing right there
[39:41] that God threw out. because he knew that
[39:44] they were going to come, amen, of
[39:46] believe the sign
[39:49] group. He knew that there was going to
[39:51] be many people who would follow that.
[39:53] Remember the Lord showed me there would
[39:55] be a great falling away as soon as the
[39:58] Lord showed me this thing came out.
[40:00] Right? Y'all remember me tell I told
[40:02] you. Now, it wasn't my word. I didn't
[40:04] know nothing about that, but God showed
[40:06] me even when it was going to be in 2012,
[40:08] so many deaths and all of that thing
[40:09] that took place.
[40:12] other brothers like brother Randy God
[40:14] revealed to him he said God showed me
[40:15] the same thing my point is look at Lot's
[40:19] wife all of a sudden this message is too
[40:26] legal all of a sudden it's too straight
[40:30] all of a sudden all these things that
[40:32] God spoke listen if brother Brandham
[40:36] ain't it then tell me who is you think
[40:39] it's been
[40:42] Y'all hear what I'm saying? If he's not
[40:45] at Listen, God didn't tell me to explain
[40:47] it. He asked me to believe it. Amen. And
[40:50] then you get this cloud. They said,
[40:51] "Well, it was this on this that." Why
[40:53] don't you think God know what he was
[40:55] doing? Jesus went and ate corn on the
[40:57] Sabbath day.
[40:59] Amen.
[41:01] He's lord of it. Amen. I don't care if
[41:03] there was 50 plains in that air. It
[41:06] didn't form that because Amen. The
[41:09] prophet God said that was my Lord. Amen.
[41:11] And those planes couldn't have caught
[41:13] him up in that in that in the cloud. He
[41:16] was caught up. Amen.
[41:20] I don't understand people's mind. But
[41:23] what it is, this had to be fulfilled
[41:26] because this is the season of the coming
[41:29] of the Lord. Amen. And he says, "Now
[41:31] remember, those who turn around will be
[41:34] caught by the fire." Yes, sir. He said,
[41:37] "Miss Lot just barely looked over her
[41:41] shoulder because of her children and her
[41:44] grandchildren." Lord, he said she had a
[41:46] greater right to look over her shoulder.
[41:49] He said, "But we know better." Amen. She
[41:53] had no example. But what it was, the
[41:55] word said, "Whatever you do, don't look
[41:58] back." And he said she heard their cry.
[42:02] She felt, you know, my grandchildren, my
[42:04] children, and they burning in the fire
[42:07] and she barely looked. He said, "That's
[42:11] exactly what Eve did." That's right.
[42:15] And what happened? The fire came.
[42:19] Don't tell me this is not a season of
[42:21] turning around. Don't tell me this is
[42:23] not a season of quitting. Don't tell me
[42:26] this is not a season of unbelief. Y'all
[42:28] hear what I'm saying? It's happening
[42:30] everywhere.
[42:33] I got a close friend of mine who could
[42:34] preach. I'll preach me 10 to
[42:38] one. 10 to one. Left his wife, divorced
[42:42] her, remarried, got children, tattoos
[42:45] all over the
[42:47] world, running to Vegas and everywhere
[42:53] else. Deep in this message.
[42:57] Hello.
[42:59] It could have been me.
[43:02] It could easily been you. But what it
[43:05] is, something got us pressing.
[43:08] Oh, it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. It
[43:11] hurts.
[43:13] But I refuse to barely, merely look over
[43:16] my shoulder. I refuse it. I'm going to
[43:19] keep my eyes on Jesus.
[43:22] It's got to come.
[43:25] Is that right? Amen. Because he begins
[43:27] to tell us about the rapture who he goes
[43:29] on to say, "Whosoever shall seek to save
[43:31] his life shall lose it, and whosoever
[43:33] shall lose his life shall preserve it."
[43:36] And you know the squeeze coming. You
[43:38] know the test is coming, folks. It's
[43:40] happening. The way Putin is all over
[43:43] there in Russia and everything about
[43:44] what we doing in America, the bomb is in
[43:47] the shelter. All he not need to do is
[43:49] get upset one too many times, take a
[43:51] vodka, and hit it. Amen. Cuz that's what
[43:53] brother Brandham said. They say one day
[43:55] they'll have too many
[43:58] bakers. Hello.
[44:01] And they are they they you know what
[44:03] they doing? They thinning us out.
[44:05] Amen.
[44:07] Brother Brandon even made a quote how
[44:09] America would be overthrown because of
[44:12] her her rejecting the gospel. The church
[44:16] is overthrown and so is the governor's
[44:18] or government is overthrown. Amen.
[44:20] Overthrown. Right now she's overthrown.
[44:23] ruled by the Catholic Church, right?
[44:26] Amen. The fire. We don't have much time.
[44:30] You can say, "Oh, brother, listen. Don't
[44:32] you go by what your eyes are seeing."
[44:34] Amen. If you praying, you ought to be
[44:36] able to sense this thing. Amen.
[44:40] It is a time of urgency. How do you
[44:41] know, brother M? Because I'm going to
[44:43] tell you something. Those devils don't
[44:44] want to easily let you go. That's right.
[44:46] Amen. Amen. It's more difficult now than
[44:50] it's ever been to be delivered or
[44:52] overcome.
[44:55] I know what I'm talking about. Amen. I
[44:57] fight all the time. I lose some and I
[45:00] win some. But you know what, brother?
[45:02] I'm still a winner because of the grace
[45:04] of God.
[45:07] He says, "Listen, whosoever is a seek is
[45:08] like like righteous, right?" He said, "I
[45:10] tell you, in that night there should be
[45:12] two in the bed." That's what he he's
[45:14] like explaining the rapture. Miss Lot
[45:16] turns right a after she turns to you see
[45:20] what I'm saying in the same thing he's
[45:22] talking about the future events and he's
[45:26] telling you remember Lot's wife is that
[45:29] a prophecy is it a just a warning see
[45:32] everything else was a prophecy this is
[45:34] going to happen and is happening
[45:39] and he answers and said where Lord and
[45:42] he said to them in the 37th verse
[45:45] Wheresoever the body is, thither will
[45:47] the eagles be gathered together. Oh,
[45:50] ain't you glad? Aren't you happy that
[45:52] God gave us a bloody bleeding message
[45:56] and he's promised that where the eagles
[45:58] the eagles will stay with it. She'll
[46:00] stay with it. Amen.
[46:03] She can't she can't help it. She knows
[46:05] that's where the fresh kill is.
[46:07] She understands that this is the thing
[46:09] that'll give me rapturing faith.
[46:13] The rapture faith ain't nothing but the
[46:15] sealing of the Holy Ghost.
[46:18] All right? If that same spirit be in
[46:19] you, remember I read that quote this
[46:22] morning where it says, let me read it
[46:25] again if that's
[46:30] okay. You love the
[46:32] Lord. You know, you look at this thing
[46:34] and you say, "Well, Brother
[46:35] Brooks, maybe I am out of my mind. I I
[46:38] can't help it. I I just I just know one
[46:41] thing that uh we're soon to be caught up
[46:42] out of here. I know a lot of people
[46:45] don't want to uh uh believe that we've
[46:48] seen this thing uh move and it's moved.
[46:50] He said without the let me he let me I
[46:53] don't know if that's it or not. Yeah. He
[46:54] said without the baptism of the Holy
[46:56] Ghost, he said you're lost. You won't
[46:58] have to worry about getting to heaven.
[47:00] If there's nothing in here that's
[47:02] supernatural, the door can't unlock. You
[47:05] can walk there, bump your head against
[47:07] it. But if the spirit of God is is in
[47:10] there, the spirit of God inside will
[47:12] unhinge the doors. See, no Pentecostal
[47:15] message or nothing could have told us
[47:17] about that. What unhinges the door? He
[47:20] said God to have the thing in here to
[47:22] unlock it yonder. That's right. So you
[47:25] already judge just one on what uh you
[47:30] think about Jesus Christ. Now here he
[47:33] comes torn, riven, torn to pieces. His
[47:37] soul went to God, blessed him, and when
[47:40] his soul returned back in the form of
[47:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes
[47:44] into every believer. And that's why
[47:46] brother Brandham, amen, no doubt was
[47:47] saying if Beethoven was in you, you
[47:49] would do the things of Beethoven.
[47:51] Hallelujah. If the person of Jesus
[47:53] Christ is in you, you will do the p the
[47:55] things that Jesus Christ will do. Don't
[47:57] you stop people till you have completely
[48:00] lost your mind. Amen. Hello. Don't you
[48:03] stop. Amen. Till you know and how many
[48:06] times you've seen God in you. Somebody
[48:09] screaming and hollering at you and you
[48:11] know in that old man you would have been
[48:13] right back on it. You can't even open
[48:15] your mouth. You can't say nothing and
[48:16] they just constantly going on and you
[48:18] know that ain't you. Amen. And the devil
[48:20] on your left side saying you know man a
[48:22] few days
[48:24] ago if they had talked to me like that.
[48:26] You know what I'm saying? You marvel at
[48:29] this thing, this Holy Ghost control. You
[48:31] marvel at it. That's when you know
[48:34] you're packing something.
[48:36] Come on. And understand, don't measure
[48:38] what I do by what you do. Amen. Every
[48:41] man is allowed the measure of faith.
[48:43] That's right. And God gives you enough
[48:45] faith to do what he planned for you to
[48:48] do. Amen. Don't give you no more. He
[48:50] doesn't give you no less. He gives you
[48:53] just what you need. God don't put on the
[48:54] show for nobody. Thank you, Lord. But
[48:56] because you have faith to move mountains
[48:58] don't mean that you got more God than
[49:00] me. Amen. Hallelujah. Y'all hear what
[49:03] I'm saying? Why? Because a teaspoon is
[49:05] just as important as a ocean.
[49:09] Amen. I got just as much. It's just that
[49:12] God done called me to do something
[49:13] different. Amen. So trying times is on.
[49:17] When? Now. Even thus shall it be in that
[49:21] day. Is that right? And I got here.
[49:22] Don't worry about your stuff.
[49:29] too much stuff we do. We just oh my, you
[49:32] know, we we get so caught up. The Bible
[49:35] said, "Don't even take no thought for
[49:38] tomorrow." And I don't anymore.
[49:41] Especially when it come to
[49:43] bills. I don't. Amen. If I'm living to
[49:47] see tomorrow, I work with
[49:49] it. Cuz that's the truth. People, y'all
[49:52] don't tell me, "Have you worried? You
[49:54] got 30 days and you worried about it 30
[49:59] days. You don't do that. You enjoy Jesus
[50:02] day by day. Amen. God will drop
[50:05] something in on you. He always He's
[50:08] faithful. God is faithful.
[50:14] Listen, in the infallible word of God,
[50:16] that's with anything. Something do and
[50:18] you don't you ain't got the money and
[50:20] all that kind of stuff. Why you worried
[50:21] about it? You don't even know where
[50:22] you're going to live to to do it. That's
[50:24] right. And if you come to that day and
[50:26] you ain't got it, then God got a way of
[50:28] escape somewhere. Amen. God going to fix
[50:30] it. He'll work it for you. Amen. A lot
[50:32] of time we faint and want to give up and
[50:34] because we don't realize, amen, what
[50:36] what's next? What we supposed to do?
[50:38] Well, we're not supposed to worry,
[50:40] right?
[50:43] Y'all looking at like me like I'm crazy.
[50:45] It's the truth. What you worried about
[50:47] it? You either believe and trust God.
[50:49] Wait a minute. Let me let me let me back
[50:51] it up cuz I'm now in a channel. I can
[50:53] see I done hit something. Let me say let
[50:55] me tell you like this. You think God
[50:58] didn't know where where where you were
[51:00] when you was a
[51:02] sinner? The Bible said even darkness is
[51:05] like to God. Amen.
[51:07] God saw you on the dance room. He saw
[51:10] that bullet when it passed your head.
[51:13] He saw that man who wanted to kill you
[51:15] or that woman. However it was, God saw
[51:17] that who protected you.
[51:24] You know, every little thing we get
[51:26] into, you think God got his eyes
[51:29] closed, he allowed it to happen. He want
[51:32] to see your faith in him. Amen.
[51:38] If God can open a m ocean, a sea for uh
[51:41] uh uh Moses, what about you? Amen.
[51:45] Moses ain't no greater than you. A
[51:47] matter of fact, you're greater in that
[51:49] sense. You're a true son right out of
[51:50] his bosom. Amen.
[51:56] Oh, come on, somebody. I'm a witness. I
[51:59] can tell you some stuff.
[52:04] I'm in, you know, I got some situations
[52:06] right now and my hair ain't going great
[52:08] because of
[52:12] that. No sir, I ain't worried. No sir.
[52:16] You know there the devil had me in a
[52:18] place trying to get me to worry. Then
[52:20] the Lord just quickened me. You He owns
[52:22] everything. That's right. Amen. Let me
[52:25] tell y'all something. I remember the
[52:27] time my wife and I, we had went through
[52:30] a lawsuit with a house and we went
[52:32] through this lawsuit and for whatever
[52:34] reason we, you know, we didn't win it.
[52:36] But nevertheless, Amen. They had this
[52:38] house where we had owned and had gone
[52:41] through a foreclosure. We needed a new
[52:43] house.
[52:45] I said, "Lord, if we own if we really
[52:49] owe," cuz we didn't really. It was the
[52:51] system and the way it's designed. But
[52:53] the point is, I said, "God, we need this
[52:56] house." I said, "But if you would blind
[52:59] them to these records and let us get
[53:01] into this
[53:03] house," I said, "I promise I'll I'll pay
[53:06] it." Now, let me tell you what God did.
[53:09] God stripped that thing completely off
[53:12] the record as if we never owned
[53:16] it. We got a house. Hallelujah. They
[53:19] couldn't find it. There was no history.
[53:23] And the devil says, "Oh, you ought to
[53:24] leave it that way." I said, "No, I
[53:27] promise God."
[53:30] And I told them people, I kept calling
[53:32] them. I said, "It got to be somewhere
[53:33] cuz we live there. You need to find it."
[53:35] They finally found it. And the devil
[53:39] say, "You a foolish
[53:41] man." No, I promised God I would take
[53:45] care of it. He took care of me and I
[53:48] promised to do it right. Y'all hear what
[53:50] I'm saying? You just need to know how to
[53:52] talk to him.
[53:55] I'm telling you, he's your father.
[54:01] He's your dad. He tell He'll do just
[54:03] what you need him to do. Don't think
[54:04] it's strange. Amen. Listen, this is
[54:07] what's strange to me. He told He told
[54:10] David, "If you wanted Bash Sheba, you
[54:11] could have her." Now, that's
[54:13] strange. And if God could do that for Ba
[54:16] for David, he could do it for me. I'm
[54:18] just not going to refuse to ask him.
[54:20] Y'all understand what I'm saying? I
[54:22] don't care how it look like it's
[54:23] impossible. God is a God of
[54:26] impossibility that makes things
[54:27] possible. Amen. Don't ever look at a
[54:31] mountain like it can't be moved. Amen.
[54:33] He said it could be. You got to trust
[54:35] him. Speak to it. Talk to it. Oh, I
[54:39] know. I I It's true. It's
[54:42] true.
[54:44] Yes. Remember I said this morning, the
[54:46] fire that God sends your way does not
[54:50] come to put you in bondage. The fire and
[54:54] the trial that comes your way is to free
[54:56] you. I showed you that, right? I showed
[54:59] you this morning that when they threw
[55:01] those Hebrew boys into the fire, before
[55:03] they even got there, the bond, the
[55:05] bondage, it was broken. They had them
[55:07] tied. The fire, the heat broke them.
[55:09] Release them. Right somewhere, the trial
[55:13] comes to release you in the sense that
[55:16] you really come to know who you are and
[55:19] that no trial, no test, amen, is able to
[55:23] consume you.
[55:26] I don't care what it is. Amen.
[55:30] God proved it. Even if it's death.
[55:32] Hello.
[55:34] Lazarus dead four days.
[55:38] Impossible with men, but not with God.
[55:42] And I don't care if you got one of those
[55:44] kind of situation that looks like
[55:45] Lazarus, stinking, bloated, and rotten
[55:47] with maggots. God still able to bring it
[55:49] back to life. That's the way it is.
[55:52] Uhuh. Amen. Man, ain't no use in, you
[55:55] know, this uh how can I say
[56:00] it? I don't like to be
[56:04] sad. I really don't like to be sad. I
[56:08] don't like to be burdened. I don't like
[56:10] that
[56:11] stuff. I rather look sad, happy, joyous,
[56:14] and stupid.
[56:17] I I just That's me. I don't like I don't
[56:20] like being sad. I don't like that
[56:22] feeling. That ain't a good feeling. In
[56:23] other words, there it's not meant for
[56:25] you to be. That's right.
[56:28] In the presence of the Lord is fullness
[56:30] of joy.
[56:32] So if sadness is and and and and this
[56:34] other stuff is done overtaken you, then
[56:35] it what's happening? You're not in his
[56:37] presence.
[56:39] Because in his presence is joy, fullness
[56:41] of joy. Let me move on, folks. I hope
[56:44] somebody being blessed. I'm trying to
[56:46] get you to see that the trial, the
[56:48] trials that that you're going through.
[56:50] There's no shame. There's no
[56:51] embarrassment. Every one of us are going
[56:53] through something in here. Every one of
[56:56] us.
[57:01] And so it was designed by my father cuz
[57:04] I asked him, I want to be just like
[57:06] you. First of all, he says, "Listen,
[57:10] before I can even build with you, I got
[57:12] to learn. I got to give you a lesson in
[57:15] trusting me with all your heart.
[57:22] Just like I was telling somebody the
[57:24] other day, this morning actually as we
[57:25] were talking about healing, I'm almost
[57:27] done talking about healing. I said, if
[57:30] you done prayed for the child and every
[57:33] 10, 15 minutes you run back there with a
[57:35] thermometer. We didn't say it all like
[57:37] that. But my point
[57:40] is, take it to the hospital.
[57:45] Faith ain't going to run back with a
[57:46] thermometer, right? Amen. Once prayed is
[57:50] finished. Amen. You're not looking at
[57:53] the lying symptoms. Oh, come on,
[57:55] somebody. But if you're going back and
[57:58] forth, going back and forth, it shows
[58:00] you just trying to get it.
[58:04] Faith is a rock. It's a revelation.
[58:06] Hallelujah. All right. I was telling him
[58:09] this morning, I said, "Don't you know my
[58:10] oldest son right now got a scar in his
[58:12] head right now. He had a ring worm. Me
[58:16] and my wife prayed for it." Y'all know
[58:17] what a ring worm is? When your hair dry
[58:20] out, something scalpy coming and all it
[58:22] falls out and all that. Well, we
[58:25] constantly done prayed for it and still
[58:27] got oil and scrubbing it and trying to
[58:30] do it the old time way. And it turned
[58:32] out to be a bad sore. Oh, it was nasty
[58:34] looking, but we was having faith.
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:40] That wasn't no faith. That was
[58:42] unbelief. Let me put it this way. At the
[58:44] end of the row, we still went to the
[58:46] doctor. He still gave him a shot to cure
[58:49] it. In a day or two, it was
[58:53] gone. I'm just trying to tell you. And
[58:56] he's got a scar in his head to remind me
[58:59] of my lack of
[59:01] faith. You hear what I'm saying? Thank
[59:05] God for a prophet who gave us a balance
[59:09] between the medicine and God. Amen.
[59:17] I'm almost done. One more quote, y'all.
[59:18] Is this okay? Because I want you to
[59:20] understand when you got faith, brother
[59:22] Ben, the word says it's a substance. You
[59:24] got it. And you don't have to wrestle
[59:26] with it. It ain't a is an or you know,
[59:29] you don't have to check nothing. Amen.
[59:33] When God revealed to me uh that, you
[59:35] know, I have no high blood pressure, I
[59:37] don't keep running and getting a check
[59:40] because you know what? the devil put a
[59:42] fault in that thing and have your blood
[59:43] pressure sky high and you thought, "Oh
[59:45] my god, it ain't gone yet. You just got
[59:47] it back."
[59:52] The devil be waiting to set you up to
[59:55] drop in unbelief.
[59:57] But when it's really real, you'll know
[1:00:00] that you know that you know that you
[1:00:02] know, and your body and everything will
[1:00:04] respond to it. Amen.
[1:00:08] And I've had battles. I've had high
[1:00:10] blood pressure back and forth. You know,
[1:00:12] you know why? And God told me, he said,
[1:00:14] "Listen, I healed you. You got a
[1:00:17] weakness in your gene. So, you know, I
[1:00:20] healed you and then you go load up on
[1:00:21] the pork.
[1:00:26] I'm telling you what happened. You going
[1:00:27] I yielded you and you going to go load
[1:00:29] up on the fried chicken and the pork.
[1:00:31] What you expect is coming back. It's a
[1:00:34] weakness there." Amen.
[1:00:37] He didn't say I couldn't eat it, but you
[1:00:39] know, I get it. Oh, y'all got to
[1:00:40] understand me.
[1:00:43] I Lord done heal me. And I love fried
[1:00:46] chicken. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.
[1:00:48] And the Lord had to show me. You can't
[1:00:50] just go out and act like, you
[1:00:53] know, he healed you. He didn't give you
[1:00:56] new blood. He just healed you.
[1:01:04] I'm laughing, but I'm telling you a
[1:01:06] testimony.
[1:01:08] So, even now, I still I have to watch
[1:01:10] what I eat. I just don't eat any kind of
[1:01:12] crazy stuff. Every now and then, I eat
[1:01:14] my chicken. I have my ribs
[1:01:16] sometimes, but I keep a watch, you know.
[1:01:19] I don't go to and see what it
[1:01:21] is. And look at me. God has been good to
[1:01:24] me. Now, I'm 48 years old, brothers. I
[1:01:27] said, I've never uh visited uh look, let
[1:01:30] me let me let me this is my last quote
[1:01:32] on this message. He said, we are born by
[1:01:35] the spirit of God into the church of the
[1:01:37] living God. Certainly is. And then our
[1:01:41] character is watched by the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:44] And if we're Methodists today and they
[1:01:47] make us a little mad and we go over to
[1:01:49] the Baptist the next day and they fuss
[1:01:52] at us a little bit and something
[1:01:54] happened, the preacher say something
[1:01:56] step on your toes. Then away you go down
[1:01:59] to the pilgrim holiness or Nazarines or
[1:02:02] something like that. He said, "No wonder
[1:02:04] you pack your papers from place to place
[1:02:07] till it's about tore up.
[1:02:10] Why don't you take your name off of it
[1:02:12] anyhow and put it on the lamb's book of
[1:02:14] life? Let God take care of it and
[1:02:17] fellowship with the brethrens of like
[1:02:19] precious faith. Whether you see eye to
[1:02:22] eye or like that doesn't matter. Amen.
[1:02:25] We're at least Christians.
[1:02:28] Brethren born in the same family. God
[1:02:32] received us in our
[1:02:34] pecarities. We should receive each
[1:02:36] other. Then if then if then this son is
[1:02:40] found a good son a trustworthy son on
[1:02:44] the father can put confidence in then
[1:02:47] all that father has he falls heir to it
[1:02:50] all. He said god must come to a place
[1:02:52] where he can have confidence in us.
[1:03:00] And God was showing in this great
[1:03:02] illustration how he took Peter, James,
[1:03:04] and John up to the top of the mountain
[1:03:06] in a high place. Brought them apart from
[1:03:08] the rest of the world. He was going to
[1:03:11] show what he was going to
[1:03:15] do. To do who? To us. For us. Is that
[1:03:20] all right? So you love the Lord.
[1:03:24] Don't think these trials are strange.
[1:03:26] It's the season.
[1:03:28] It's not going to get
[1:03:31] better. You've been
[1:03:34] invited. You accept the invitation and
[1:03:37] therefore you're being
[1:03:39] tried. Ain't that a good way of looking
[1:03:41] at it? It is. It's really a good way to
[1:03:44] look at it. I am supposed to be tried in
[1:03:46] the fire in order for me to come out as
[1:03:49] pure gold. So, come on, somebody. Right?
[1:03:53] You know, and I thought about this
[1:03:54] thing. I said, "Think about this.
[1:03:57] Whether you want the fire of God or the
[1:03:59] fire of judgment, it's going to be
[1:04:02] fire. Which one you
[1:04:05] prefer?" I want the fire of God to come
[1:04:08] and cleanse and purify me no matter what
[1:04:11] it takes. Say, "Well, you ought to be
[1:04:13] careful how you said it. Why should I?"
[1:04:16] Whoa. No matter what it takes,
[1:04:19] right? When it's all over, I'm with him.
[1:04:23] That's all that
[1:04:26] matters. That's all that
[1:04:29] matters. When it's all said and
[1:04:33] done, we're with him.
[1:04:37] Now, I don't know about you, but I
[1:04:41] am. Any
[1:04:46] day. See, that's that. I love that song
[1:04:49] cuz now it's closer now than it's ever
[1:04:51] been. And brothers and sisters, let me
[1:04:54] tell you this. We are so blessed because
[1:04:57] we're still
[1:04:58] standing. Y'all, let me tell y'all this.
[1:05:01] It doesn't take but one time a spirit
[1:05:03] get a hold of you and cause you to
[1:05:06] turn. Now, you know, think about Miss
[1:05:09] Lot. And I say this so you can
[1:05:10] understand. She knew what the words say,
[1:05:13] but she failed to see that God was
[1:05:15] watching her.
[1:05:18] And don't get me wrong, brother B said
[1:05:20] we all backslide every day.
[1:05:23] See, so I'm not talking about that. I'm
[1:05:25] just saying how sometimes we let the
[1:05:30] enemy merely turn
[1:05:34] us. Am I by myself? I'm telling you what
[1:05:38] it
[1:05:38] is.
[1:05:41] Now, we got a word. Don't let nothing
[1:05:44] turn you from this.
[1:05:47] I don't care what comes your way. Don't
[1:05:49] even merely don't even think I was
[1:05:50] telling a brother, a close friend of
[1:05:52] mine. He even called another brother
[1:05:53] down there in in uh uh uh Georgia
[1:05:56] telling him how he done what, brother
[1:05:57] Brandham. This is wrong, that wrong,
[1:05:59] this wrong, this wrong. When he called
[1:06:01] me, brother, I tell you what, who was a
[1:06:02] close friend of mine. He's gifted. He
[1:06:05] was a man when when I tried to commit
[1:06:07] suicide, came to my house, told me all
[1:06:09] about it. Showed God showed him to him.
[1:06:12] Showed me showed what I did to that man.
[1:06:14] And nobody in my house or my church knew
[1:06:16] what what went on. God, that man was all
[1:06:19] the way in Indiana come to my house
[1:06:21] sitting up in my office say, "You ain't
[1:06:23] preaching
[1:06:24] tonight." Yeah, I am. He said, "If you
[1:06:26] do," he said, "I'll tell the church what
[1:06:28] you just tried to
[1:06:30] do." And I was in this message when I
[1:06:32] tried
[1:06:34] that. You can't tell me you can't get
[1:06:37] depressed in this message. If God don't
[1:06:40] put a hedge around you, you'll take your
[1:06:42] own life if God don't stop
[1:06:45] you. That's how depressed I was going
[1:06:48] through my middle age and my and
[1:06:50] everything, not even knowing what I was
[1:06:52] going through and everything looked like
[1:06:53] it was coming against me. Yes.
[1:06:56] Me, that same
[1:06:59] brother flew me down to Miami, gave me a
[1:07:02] room, and he took off. Gave me four days
[1:07:05] where I could unwind and talk to God.
[1:07:08] I I was I was just
[1:07:12] frustrated. That's when I realized God
[1:07:14] had another work for me to
[1:07:18] do. And that same brother is now saying
[1:07:21] who was raised up in this
[1:07:25] message, saying it ain't right. It ain't
[1:07:27] this and ain't
[1:07:29] that. And I said to him, I said, "If you
[1:07:31] going to take this away from me, please
[1:07:33] give me something better."
[1:07:36] Huh? You got something better? Give it
[1:07:39] to me. I want to see it. It sure ain't
[1:07:44] you. You ain't got nothing following
[1:07:46] you, Harley. And you can't be telling me
[1:07:48] you right and Brother Bam
[1:07:52] wrong. Oh, that devil is
[1:07:56] smart. But I'm a wise builder.
[1:08:00] Nobody didn't force me into this. It was
[1:08:03] a true revelation from God.
[1:08:05] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen. My
[1:08:07] house is built to pun.
[1:08:10] Amen. It don't make the the word God
[1:08:12] done told me the storm's coming. The
[1:08:14] wind's going to blow. It's going to beat
[1:08:15] upon the house. But this house is going
[1:08:17] to stand cuz that's where I am. I'm
[1:08:20] right in that scripture. The house that
[1:08:22] the wise man that built his house upon a
[1:08:25] rock. Amen.
[1:08:28] Hallelujah. My granddaughter tried to
[1:08:30] make my facial expressions, but by the
[1:08:32] grace of God, you love the Lord.
[1:08:36] Amen. Amen. It's so good to see you.
[1:08:39] Amen. I don't I don't think I've ever
[1:08:41] seen my brother's face, but it's a good
[1:08:44] face. It's been a long while is what it
[1:08:46] is.
[1:08:48] Amen. Amen. I love the Lord. I'm blessed
[1:08:51] to have have you here. See, I've been
[1:08:53] missing you. I thought I thought Lord
[1:08:55] the last time I talked to him, he
[1:08:56] wouldn't talk and I had, you know, my
[1:08:58] mind was all fuzzy and I'm like, "Oh,
[1:09:00] Lord, I missed that opportunity." But
[1:09:03] thank God. Ain't God good to
[1:09:06] us? People of God, you know, we love
[1:09:09] each other. We love each other. That's
[1:09:11] all that matters. The love of God being
[1:09:14] shared abroad in our heart. That's what
[1:09:16] this communion is all about. Amen. Being
[1:09:19] able to work with one another uh uh in
[1:09:23] spite of all of our differences. Because
[1:09:26] what difference is it going to make? I
[1:09:27] mean, if we stand both in the mirror,
[1:09:30] we'll find a lot of differences. Don't
[1:09:31] you
[1:09:33] think? Even my own children, we can
[1:09:36] stand them all in line and we'll find
[1:09:39] differences. But we're family and that's
[1:09:43] what makes it all work. We're family.
[1:09:46] And whatever I say to you by the grace
[1:09:48] of God, if God still got your desire,
[1:09:52] that's what Rever say. He said, if you
[1:09:53] still got a desire in your heart to
[1:09:55] serve God, he said, God is not moving
[1:09:57] yet. And I don't care. Like I read this
[1:10:00] morning, the weakest saint is able to
[1:10:02] defeat Satan anywhere, any place, any
[1:10:05] time, under any condition. The weakest
[1:10:07] saint. So even if you call consider
[1:10:10] yourself weak, you still can whoop the
[1:10:12] devil. That's the word. That's the word.
[1:10:16] So you love the
[1:10:18] Lord. I hope I wasn't too long. I just
[1:10:20] trust that God blessed you somehow,
[1:10:23] encouraged you. This was an encouraging
[1:10:25] message. uh tried to be uh so that you
[1:10:28] can see uh listen this is what I always
[1:10:31] tell people like brother Bham said he
[1:10:34] said like if you repent be baptized in
[1:10:36] the name of the lord Jesus Christ he
[1:10:37] said god promise you the holy ghost it's
[1:10:39] your promise it's yours and I I think
[1:10:43] sometime we even myself we have we have
[1:10:47] it's been exploited in a way but my
[1:10:50] point is this when you see a life
[1:10:53] change something took
[1:10:57] face, you know, something took place and
[1:11:01] you know, Pentecostal made it emotions.
[1:11:04] We love emotions. But the truth of the
[1:11:06] matter is when you see a change in your
[1:11:08] life, you know, and that change makes
[1:11:11] you desire more God, that means
[1:11:14] something's living
[1:11:15] there. A pregnant woman don't eat like
[1:11:18] she, you know, she she eats like she's
[1:11:21] pregnant because there's a life in her.
[1:11:23] Yeah. Y'all y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:11:24] And that's what I'm talking about. When
[1:11:26] you love this word, don't even think
[1:11:28] about making mistakes cuz you're going
[1:11:30] to make them.
[1:11:32] God ain't judging that flesh. It's
[1:11:34] condemned. It's that life dead that that
[1:11:38] justifies you, that sanctifies you, that
[1:11:40] that that makes you accept it. And it
[1:11:43] can, it is so
[1:11:46] small. That's why he said that still
[1:11:49] small voice is so small. Sometimes God
[1:11:52] talk to you and you think it's your
[1:11:54] conscience and it's God talking to you
[1:11:58] so small. And you and I must understand,
[1:12:01] amen, that what what we're now seeing,
[1:12:03] you know, it ain't no open show. But
[1:12:06] you're the greatest mystery that ever
[1:12:07] hit the earth.
[1:12:09] God revealing himself to a people and
[1:12:12] tabernacling himself. And the whole
[1:12:14] world, don't expect the world to see
[1:12:16] this, is blinded. Amen. God could
[1:12:19] creating right in their eyes and they
[1:12:21] don't even see it. Reject you, talk
[1:12:24] about you, say all manner of things
[1:12:25] about you and don't even know you'll one
[1:12:28] day sit on the throne and judge them
[1:12:30] all.
[1:12:32] You greater than a Cinderella
[1:12:36] story. Huh?
[1:12:40] Greater you.
[1:12:42] all of us who've been just messed
[1:12:47] up. Ain't too many people uh come out of
[1:12:50] this age
[1:12:55] clean. Y'all don't have to say amen. I
[1:12:57] know it's true.
[1:13:02] You know what? It is what it is. But
[1:13:05] don't you think, let me say it like
[1:13:09] this in closing. Brother said like this,
[1:13:14] I'm sorry. Uh the word of God says it
[1:13:16] like this. He says in Simon's house, who
[1:13:18] will love me the
[1:13:23] most? That's why we had to come in this
[1:13:25] age cuz we're the age that loves him the
[1:13:29] most. You said, "But I'm not a martyr."
[1:13:31] Yes, you are. You died to yourself.
[1:13:38] You You willingly took the cross.
[1:13:42] You willingly chose this way. You could
[1:13:44] have been in a Baptist, a Methodist, any
[1:13:46] kind of place. You chose this narrow
[1:13:48] straight way where they say you can't do
[1:13:51] this, you can't do that, you can't do
[1:13:52] this.
[1:13:53] Why? It ain't because we can't do I
[1:13:56] don't want to do.
[1:14:00] That's the beauty of it. The devil I I
[1:14:03] used to want to be a Christian for a
[1:14:04] long time and I used to say, "But I
[1:14:06] can't do it." I didn't even realize that
[1:14:08] that was what God wanted to
[1:14:12] hear. I didn't know that. I didn't
[1:14:15] understand the Holy Ghost. I didn't
[1:14:17] understand God coming in you and living
[1:14:21] it. And let me tell you something. A lot
[1:14:23] of us got more than what we think we
[1:14:24] got.
[1:14:26] The thing is, you just need to just move
[1:14:28] the unbelief out of the way and work it.
[1:14:31] Take what God has given you and work it.
[1:14:34] That's what the word of God said. A SC
[1:14:37] caught whatever gorge, right? Uh uh uh.
[1:14:40] Huh? Ox code.
[1:14:43] Yes. A coat. Number of stick with a
[1:14:47] point on the end. Right. That's right.
[1:14:50] And how many Philistines he whooped with
[1:14:52] it. Right. That's all he had. That was
[1:14:54] the power of the Holy Ghost. Right. Cuz
[1:14:57] that stick would have would have broken
[1:14:58] everything else. Come on. You see the
[1:15:01] old jaw jawbone of ass? That's all he
[1:15:03] had. and he whooped the Philistines with
[1:15:06] it. The jawbone never cracked in pieces.
[1:15:09] Y'all hear what I'm saying? That was
[1:15:11] God. That was God. And you might have
[1:15:13] just a little bit of whatever. You may
[1:15:16] It's It is what it
[1:15:19] is. I've seen people, and I don't mean
[1:15:22] no harm. It's true. I hope y'all don't
[1:15:25] get offended by this, but
[1:15:26] Germans, they're not so
[1:15:30] emotional. They're not. They're just
[1:15:34] not. I got friends right now. I know
[1:15:36] they got the Holy Ghost, but they're not
[1:15:39] as emotional as I am. And what I'm going
[1:15:41] to say, because you don't have, you're
[1:15:42] not emotional as I am, you don't have
[1:15:45] it. No, I watch the life.
[1:15:50] It's the life
[1:15:53] people. It's the way they love God. It's
[1:15:56] the way they conduct,
[1:15:58] right? And that's how it is in certain
[1:16:01] people. It it's been breaded in that
[1:16:04] way. Brother Brother Randy and I were
[1:16:06] just talking on yesterday. Certain
[1:16:07] things just bred it in
[1:16:09] you. You might feel it in a different
[1:16:11] way. You might express it in a different
[1:16:14] way, but you still got it.
[1:16:17] You pray, you listen, you read, you
[1:16:19] study. Amen. And that life is still
[1:16:22] coming. Listen, I tell you the
[1:16:26] truth. Put it this way. I can't be you
[1:16:30] and you can't be me.
[1:16:35] But there is a variety. Amen. And every
[1:16:38] man has his
[1:16:40] gifted,
[1:16:43] right? I know one brother right now, he
[1:16:45] would jump anyhow. He didn't feel
[1:16:48] nothing. He told me, "Brother brother
[1:16:51] brother uh uh uh uh Jesse, he'd be
[1:16:55] preaching." And y'all know how Jesse, he
[1:16:57] be feeling
[1:16:58] nothing. He said, "That you don't feel
[1:17:01] nothing." No. He said, "I just I'm just
[1:17:02] excited by the word." I said, "That's
[1:17:04] probably what it is
[1:17:05] then." But you know how I how people
[1:17:08] say, "Oh, you feel all this and you feel
[1:17:10] all that and oh, I can feel it." Well,
[1:17:12] everybody can't feel it like I do. But
[1:17:14] that don't mean you got to keep still.
[1:17:16] Amen. The devil say, "Well, you man."
[1:17:18] No, I'm not. I'm not manufacturing
[1:17:21] anything. I'm doing because I'm
[1:17:23] willfully giving him a praise. I'm
[1:17:25] willfully doing it. I'm feeling like I
[1:17:27] want to do it. I might not feel his
[1:17:29] anointing, but he can so feel mine.
[1:17:32] That's the way it works. Is that all
[1:17:35] right? I hope that was a I did right on
[1:17:37] that. I hope I didn't do wrong. I meant
[1:17:39] well because I want you to understand,
[1:17:41] Amen. Sometime you just can't help how
[1:17:43] you made. But because you made a certain
[1:17:46] way don't mean you don't have the Holy
[1:17:48] Ghost. That's all I'm
[1:17:51] saying. That's all I'm saying.
[1:17:58] Well, we're going to prepare to do this
[1:18:01] uh
[1:18:06] uh
[1:18:07] communion and I know I I know you know
[1:18:11] everybody I I look at myself and I'm
[1:18:13] going to tell y'all right now to this
[1:18:14] day. Don't you know the devil tell me
[1:18:16] sometime you ain't got
[1:18:19] it. Anybody in here? Am I the only one
[1:18:22] that's in there? He tell me, "Oh, you
[1:18:23] ain't got it." And he's got some good
[1:18:25] evidence, too. He He roll it out, man.
[1:18:28] This is this long
[1:18:31] list. That's what he is. If you could
[1:18:34] all if you could remember he is a liar.
[1:18:36] And when a liar tell you what you don't
[1:18:38] have, that means you got it. Amen. Why?
[1:18:41] He's wasting his time telling you what
[1:18:43] you don't have. If you didn't have it,
[1:18:45] he just need to leave you alone. That's
[1:18:47] it. That's it. Amen. But he's constantly
[1:18:50] telling you what you don't have so he
[1:18:52] you can believe you don't have when you
[1:18:54] got it so it won't be
[1:18:57] effective. He's a liar. Oh, you ain't
[1:19:00] got it. Hello. You can't tell me what I
[1:19:03] don't have. Were you
[1:19:07] there? Y'all hear what I'm saying? You
[1:19:09] got it. You going to always have battles
[1:19:11] with this flesh. You going to always
[1:19:13] have mind battles till Jesus come. As
[1:19:18] long as this nasty flesh is attacked to
[1:19:20] you, attached to you, you going to have
[1:19:22] battles. That's why he got to change it.
[1:19:27] But those battles sometime can rage so
[1:19:29] much that you really think the devil can
[1:19:30] come and say, "See, you ain't got
[1:19:34] it. Is that all right?" He told he told
[1:19:37] Brother Baron, he said, "You know, you
[1:19:39] got to be a devil." Brother Baron said,
[1:19:41] "I can't be a devil." He said, "I love
[1:19:42] him too much."
[1:19:46] Oh Lord Jesus. Ain't God good? Amen.
