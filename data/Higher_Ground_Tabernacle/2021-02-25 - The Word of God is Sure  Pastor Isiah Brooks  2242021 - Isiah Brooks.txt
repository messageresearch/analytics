willing we won't be here we haven't asked our brother to preach yet but hopefully he'll be able to brother troy intent is to go down to iowa city we'll be going to michigan cadillac michigan if the lord will if not we'll see you sunday but uh by god's grace we want to do what the lord would have us to do thank god for the musicians of song service was really wonderful we appreciate you we do apologize for those who were listening and couldn't hear for a while but thank god for them being able to get it all straightened out and we're not going to prolong the time we're going to get right into the word of god we'll appreciate our brother troy and his wife and family they do so much and we rarely give them credit but uh we really appreciate you anyway for all of those of who who help make the services go well we thank you and we appreciate you dearly we really we're going to be coming from second corinthians the first chapter we'll read the 20 and the 22nd verse and then we'll come from romans the 8th chapter 14 through the 17th verse we preached a message down in iowa city of last week sunday this is where i belong and um that's in christ alone and uh we we want to maybe recap a little bit of that before we go into our thought tonight our thought tonight is the word of god is sure the word of god is sure we need some assurance in this time when everything seemed to be falling apart and i just believe that god is i think how can i say it i'm glad that god is not surprised at us the bible says he knows us from the beginning to the end he knows he's the alpha and the omega and so we're trusting that the lord will bless us tonight in the word second corinthians the first chapter the 20th to the 22nd verse for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us now he which establishes us with you in christ and have have anointed us is god who have also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts romans 8. we'll begin reading at the 14th verse you love the lord for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father the spirit in itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if the children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you do thank you lord for you knowing and all things nothing comes to you by surprise and we thank you lord for being the kind of god that you are bless the service uh tonight hopefully it we we trust and pray that you will minister to each and every heart those who are listening by way of the youtube and those who are here in the house of the lord tonight bless each and every heart in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i appreciate the number of people that we have here tonight because i've been here at times when it was not so many but we appreciate your pressing through to come tonight but one of the things that i really wanted to emphasize and i think and i know that we have heard this many times when we say god's word stands no matter what but we know also that without faith is impossible to please him and we must wash our minds we must wash our minds from all unbelief because unbelief is the thing that hinders god he can only move by faith now don't get me wrong even if we would disbelieve god's word stands true when you think about something that is sure it is free from doubt as to the reliability you know the character the action etc of something to be sure of like one's data in other words something that you have accumulated by way of a process and you know that the end result is the correct result and there is no other way to bring you to that result other than by the way you have uh processed it and when we come to faith faith is not something that you can process but it's something that god gives you it is a gift from god i was telling a brother the other day i said you know when god healed me he gave me a faith that i had never had before and i have never experienced that since that time but it was what i needed to gain the victory and to some people we may not understand what what that is because it is a revelation how can you explain a revelation how can you explain that jesus christ is lord but you know it it's not something that you hope to know it's something that has been revealed to you and is so revealed to you it is sure it is the way god works why because god wants us to understand that every promise that he promised us is yay i was thinking the other day because all of us have things that we must overcome and there are times when you think that you've overcome and you have not or you result back to it and the lord spoke something to me and it was simple in order to overcome you must first believe that overcoming is for you whatever it is you got to believe that that you can do it not that you can do it but the god in you can do it because it's not self-righteousness it's actually the grace of god that god gives you that revelation that you can do it all right and when we look at these things it's it's amazing because everybody in the world is not led by god you know god doesn't lead a man to kill someone or god doesn't lead a man uh to do evil we make those choices he allowed demons to come to us but we still make choices but when it comes to these last days i was thinking i said lord you are making your words so sure you make it almost impossible to disbelieve because everything that god has promised he has brought it to pass everything that has been prophesied he's brought it to pass every word looking through the bible and not only through the bible but even in our own lives god if he promises you something he brings it to pass those of us who are led by the spirit are often times looked upon as being insane because it's not um how can i say it to the intellectual mind it makes no it's not reasonable it's it it's something that you can't reason you know how would it have been if if uh let me say it like this how can you explain jesus walking on the water how can you explain a man who was dead for four days rot it and god calls him by name and he gets up you can't explain those things why are you saying these things because we are living in a society where they're trying to make god a myth but the bible says that god has never left himself without a witness there's always somebody who'll be able to testify that i know he's real and to be led by god is not something that oh um how can i say it lord give me grace to be led by god it's more than a feeling it's a revelation you understand me because you can feel any and everything but when it comes to god god does not rest on these natural things are these little things that can fail you he always leads you in a way amen and it's a way of revelation something you can't explain something can that there cannot be reason and most of the time it makes no sense to the natural man let me explain it to you how can you take a lamb and make this lamb a sacrifice for sin how can that be you know why because that's what god determined he determined that because in his mind he had a man that would be a lamb now how can you be a lamb but you don't that's the only way we get to heaven you can't be a goat you must have the lamb's nature um come just a minute you and i must understand that we're living in a time where this very bible is in question by the world but like i said god's word is sure we're living in a time that god had already described to us what this world would be like in this day and time as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of sodom and we are living in it and you say what brother brooks um no this is a day of liv uh uh uh where everybody can be liberal this is a liberal day but when you speak of the word liberal in this day you're speaking of insanity because i want you to understand i'm saying something here it may look like i'm not but i'm coming to something you and i must understand that we as a world or nation we're in trouble because we have made laws in our country that literally defies the word of god it's bad enough to be ignorant but when you bring it to a place where you are challenging god you're in trouble and that's what the world is doing this is satan's eden and the world is bringing us to a showdown now you and i are to be excited because every age has has they've had their showdown and guess what they came out victorious but now the showdown is on us we're living in a time amen when they don't want you to talk about jesus they don't want you to mention his name they don't want you to praise god they don't even want you to live right you understand me i'm coming because we're living in a time where right has become wrong and wrong has become right come on it's a time where nothing really makes sense and yet they say they're they're sane and we're the insane ones right but what was wrong yesterday is still wrong today and you and i must understand that there's their pages in this book it's not something new even solomon said there's nothing new done under the sun but my my question is if you don't know that the bible is sure if you don't know amen that there's no reason to doubt it because we've had many come this way and they stood on the word and they got victory it may look like they weren't getting victory i mean even when it comes to christ he died but to the world he was a failure i even heard the mother church say that was the worst thing jesus could do was to die not my mother's church but the best thing that he could have ever done was to die for your your sins and mine huh she is sure the bible even said listen jesus understood he who he was by the reading of the word not by feelings if he had gone by feelings he would have never gone to calvary he knew what it was going to take but he had a promise i will not leave your soul in hell neither will your flesh see corruption he had a promise of a resurrection and guess what god kept the promise is that right it sounds crazy what about in the days of noah noah had a day of showdown and i want you to understand that what they they went through is now our time the time is now and you got to understand here was noah building an ark amen for how many years 120 years he preached and no doubt he had a mega church at the beginning because everybody want to see what's going on new but after the message was over and over and over again like we do now same message but what the people did not understand even to this day that god is the same yesterday the day and forever and you can play the same tape over and over and over again and you're getting greater revelations over and over and over again that's the way god works the message don't get boring noah's message didn't get boring to those who really believed hey but i'm going to read something in just a moment because you and i must understand that the time is now and it is a sure thing that this world is about to come to an end see people say oh i heard somebody joke and gesture about that you know they made fun oh the world is coming to an end see that's the way the devil has done it he has he has he has made a mockery but let me tell you how something you got to know this tonight if god's saying it's going to happen it's going to happen when god said that there was going to a virgin was going to conceive look how many years hundreds of years before mary ever came on the scene but the word is sure it had to happen now i'm not even on my notes but let me go back to noah because i want you to understand that no it wasn't an easy job and i think a lot of times people think it was easy it was not easy can you imagine building an ark that size a boat that size with just a few hands to help you and yet he knew it was the will of god you think he didn't get a battle he didn't have a battle he had a battle no doubt the devil says you're stupid you're foolish but noah had heard from god and he knew that even though he didn't understand what rain was that god was going to send it you understand me we don't have to understand everything but we must believe everything right brother madam says something like this he talks about it then what shall we do with this jesus called christ brother brahm says i say this with all godly respect for my brethren and my sisters and for the men and women of this day who i preach to with love in my heart for all people i wonder if we're not about ready to see the same thing as they seen then the government had become involved in this and the issue was on the question must be settled it was at a showdown so has it been today so is it in this hour the showdown is on something has got to be done you've got to say yes or no but remember it won't be when you're forced to do it you have to do it on your free moral will now now not when the that time takes place when it does it's over now this may be the last day you have time to make choice you can't do it then you already took it it's too far at that time you must do it now don't wait till the last minute because the boat will pull out and leave you the door will be closed he said many people would have come into the ark if they could have gotten in there when the rain started falling but the issue was made the gospel was preached the sign was showed and the time was over the rain was then falling and judgment was on y'all understand what he's saying many people would have come into the ark after the rain started falling but when the rain started falling the door was shut what is he saying now when the government and all began to force it and you oh lord save me now no no no no it's too late oh god give me the holy ghost now no it's too late the door is shut the time is now if you're going to get the holy ghost the time is now see not tomorrow we can't wait somehow desperation must strike us i read the same quote down in iowa city you know who came up to ask for one brother out of the whole church came up and says brother brooks pray that god would put desperation into my heart and i thought oh my god what is wrong with the people it seems like you know something is a spell or something over the people i know it's hard it's hard for me it's a battle every day and every day the battles seem to become more intense hallelujah but i do know one thing that the word of god is sure hallelujah if god said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that promise is sure but a lot of times people don't even understand that scripture says he gives you a gift of the holy ghost supposing this is my my tambourine right and i give you this tambourine that's a gift that came from me right but that ain't all to it there is me y'all understand me it's the gift of the holy ghost is just the beginning of the journey hallelujah you got to come to the statue of the full statue of christ it got it has to be a growth it has to be a maturing before god can fully seal you with the holy ghost oh i can give you tongues but that don't mean you've got the shoe understand me i can give you a gift i can give you prophecy i can give you preaching i can give you singing but that doesn't mean you get you get me with that y'all understand what i'm saying it's like when god took el easy go get my son isaac a bride but he gave eliezer all these gifts to give give rebecca right and when when eliezer gave those gifts to rebecca she still didn't have isaac she had gifts of isaac but she had to take a journey she had to take a journey amen and that journey was going to bring her to us huh and what was she riding on a camel's back and brother adam said that beast of the campbell was a type of the holy ghost she is the holy ghost that brings you to perfection you can't do it on your own but for certain god promise is sure if god calls you he said those whom i've called i've justified huh and those who have justified are glorified it's a promise well will i make it he promised it hallelujah think about it the bible said abraham staggered not at the promise and that's what we do sometimes you ever staggered oh yeah today you're saving tomorrow you're not or will i make a rapture you may not even speak it but in your mind in your battles you you know you you have to you have to shut the devil up if you don't you find your spirit dropping like this right but when you don't stagger you're standing there and no matter what he says you know that the word of god is sure he promised right it's like abraham when he god told him you're going to have a son his name is going to be isaac excuse me the bible said abraham staggered not at the promise of god no matter how old he got no matter how much he bent over no matter how much the people picked at him and laughed at him and you know they did just like they laughed at christians today what y'all talking about a rapture you ever seen a rapture before oh yeah i'm raptured you may not even see that but i'm raptured hallelujah i've been quick and i've been changed i'm just waiting on my translation hallelujah and so we must understand it meant that even the rapture itself is a process let's move on but he says and the whole nation had to reject him because that it was called as we could say today a christian nation like this is called a christian nation therefore it was called jehovah's nation his selected people and then the whole nation had to turn him down the church had already turned him down the church had kicked him out they wanted nothing to do with them but now the government is involved in it that sounds like today right yes the church then kicked him out revelations the third chapter he's outside the door knocking trying to get back in they kicked him out and when they rejected the prophet they rejected god why because he was god's representative he was god ambassador hallelujah trying to get the people to let christ the word back in but everybody want their own creeds their own dogmas they go with that kind of a thing and when it comes to truth they don't want to have nothing to do with it and now the government is involved why i heard a brother uh preached today and he was talking about how peter was preaching he says uh save yourself from this un toward generation this evil generation this perverted generation and you know what what was it he knew that because of their sin evil was knocking at the door y'all understand me do we really think that this a world or america or whoever do you really think we're going to get away god is going to allow us to just do as we do and get away with it it's not going to happen if god destroyed the whole world because of sin hallelujah he destroyed twin cities because of sin he destroyed capernaum because of sin hallelujah he destroyed pompeii because of sin hallelujah we can go all the way down and i'm going to tell you something if there was a certain a place like atlantis god destroyed atlantis because of sin you understand me and it's amazing how we have as men do not learn from our past and that's what we call a foolish person anyway let's move on by god's grace so what happened the government has now gotten into it so you say well what do you mean brother brooks uh maybe i should be afraid to say these things but i'm gonna tell you something that spirit of jezebel and ahab is running rampant it's all over the world now right and you must understand she's got one thing in her mind to kill the prophets of god huh she's blood thirsty and you must understand it's you who she wants everything that's considered amen moral and clean and concern you are in trouble hallelujah but thank god god never puts you in a fire and not join you y'all understand me hallelujah he's got that word laying right there hallelujah and he'll never ever put more on you than you can bear that's the truth hallelujah so he says so is it back again it's right back in the laps again with the scriptures laying here identified just exactly what jesus said would happen why do we stagger in this hour of darkness why do we let this come upon us when we've been thoroughly warned just as it was in the days of lot we see the very same thing jehovah has set the same the seed and told us and as it was in the days of lot you see the messengers out yonder and babylon trying to get lot out and you see the message of the elect abraham that was already out and everything exactly to name place and time has been thoroughly identified hallelujah it's not like we're walking in darkness we see it come on somebody he said well brothers while you're screaming because i i'm screaming for you and me because i realize it's a time of desperation and we need to be desperate satan is a smart character a smooth character did you not know have you ever seen a snake league trails no they so smooth and they can't even hear them right they're right up on you before you know it that's how the enemy is working even now he's moving so smoothly he's moving in such a way people can't even hear him see him but only the spiritual ones who can right tell you what you're saying god left record he told the jews he says listen god they've crucified my lord and they got a judgment coming he said i want you to tell i'm gonna tell you something when you see the armies encamped about this city he said don't you go down and get your cloak don't don't go back down on the roof you say he said run don't worry about it you just keep on running you understand me and if you can't see the armies and camped about us something's wrong they don't have to be in a military uniform there are groups there are armies there are things that satan is now pulling together in other words darkness is now condensing and they're coming together to try to block and stop the light but it doesn't matter darkness has never been able to defeat the light hallelujah even in the darkness of the night the son of god the sun pushes through it it's a battle going on light between darkness and the light always win hallelujah i don't care what they got on television like the evil wind evil never wins hallelujah didn't win in the beginning it won't win in the end let me move on to get where we are so we know as it was in that day we you had uh abraham you had uh a prophet there you had uh the the city of solomon tomorrow you had noah why didn't he say as it was an adult but he works with a lot more than anything else because of what we see in our day never in the history that we know of where it seemed to be acceptable y'all understand what i'm saying people you can't just be shy you can't say oh well i know it's happening but i ain't got nothing to say about it ain't got nothing to do with me yes it does it affects all of our families and if we don't teach and mean our children that men or men and women are women we're in trouble we're in trouble hmm now the son of man is revealed and christ has been rejected the blood has moved its position i'd like to preach on that just a little bit because a lot of people think they're under the blood because they're under organization if you're on the organization and denomination you're no longer under the blood you shouldn't say that brother but that's the truth you're under our system the blood sets you free amen is that right and you must understand amen that jesus christ was killed and crucified without the camp not in the city outside not in the church outside of the church and that's where the blood would be found so you got to understand this time that we're working with is now the world council of churches the catholicism and protestantism and all of them forming together amen to to form a great union and guess what you're the one where the pressure is going to come upon [Music] and these things need to be reiterated they need to be preached why because time is now and you got to understand so well you say oh it's coming but guess what you know what the devil has been trying to fight me with like a fear to tell people the truth they need to know the truth regardless to what it calls upon you they need to be told the truth because if you know the truth and you don't tell the truth you're holding the truth in unrighteousness and god will judge you for it has to be told but when we see the scripture the scripture says for you are dead and your life is heared with christ and god you understand what that means that means that satan can't even find where you're hidden because you are in christ you ain't god and this thing here jesus said don't fear the man who can destroy this fear the one that who can destroy the soul and the body that's where we are we're at a time amen that we must understand that these things are wicked we battle with it we fight with it listen you go to the store you can't even look at nothing it's true when i was a boy what they got on the shelves now was ungodly and would have never been there but they what they did they slowly like a serpent programmed us to accept all of these things and now that which was seen today is acceptable i mean excuse me that which was sin yesterday is acceptable for today hallelujah now i'm going to get to a place and i'm i'm i'm at a place where i want to really um let us see here what god has done i call him a mastermind he's the kind of a mind that it'll take eternity trying to learn him and know him his ways are past finding out and yet they are yet so simple and how god hides us in himself is a mystery to me but yet he does it and how that god can be in me and i can be in god at the same time it's a mystery to me but i believe it and i know it's sure when we talk about the throne of god and we always look at god like he's on this big throne and everything and i want you to know that a lot of things are symbolic i'm not saying it won't be one but i'm saying he's trying to show us something where the real throne of god is and the real throne of god is not in heaven the real throne of god is in mankind that's what the heart is all about that's why you got four chambers of four living creatures there and you and i must understand by god's grace amen that god amen is looking for people that he can control god excuse me he can completely have preeminence over i i marvel god took a man and put both male and female in him and their names were adam because they were one unit but in order to bring this his purpose to pass he allowed he separated them and the female what came the the weaker vessel she was tested she tried she was tried and she failed adam adam never failed in that instance he knew he was wrong he willfully walked out with his wife so that he could redeem her because he at that time became the redeemer can i say it like this eve husband became her redeemer in the book of isaiah he says know not that your redeemer is your husband he has to stay with the word so what are you saying the man who redeemed me is not just kinsmen but he's my husband that might sound strange but you and i understand we're the bride of christ and we cannot die hello you had eternal life before you even knew you had eternal life because the bible said that he put your name in the book of life lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and so what we do we look at this flesh and we think oh my god but let me say it like this have you heard me say this before if there is a pool in your life to serve god is worth more than gold i'm gonna say it again if there is a desire in your heart to serve god it is worth more than pure gold because everybody don't have that desire and when that desire is in your heart it means that god gave you that and if he's got you thirsting for righteousness that means you shall be filled there is a deep call to the deep and we cannot give up on god like you've hear me say because god won't give up on us in first thessalonians 5 23-24 says and every good ever and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole this is what paul doing spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the lord jesus christ he takes the man and he splits them in three to show you that that that three makes one right it's not three persons it's three parts and see that's what people don't understand there's only one god one father son in the holy ghost but three manifestations his word is sure that's why jesus said when you receive me you receive the father we're not we don't carry the body of jesus inside of us there's no fleshly part of him in us it's only the spiritual aspect of him that's in us and that spirit is god all that was in god into christ all that was in christ he poured it into his bride i wish this thing i says lord this is not something that we can manufacture but i really believe that god has an appointed time to bring everything to life think about it acts 2 38 was in the bible ever since since it was put together right and it took hundreds of years thousands to bring it to pass but it came to pass right and these last days look what it took a thousand two thousand years before we came to this last day when god says according to joel i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh it was the time of the end it was a time that god has already set for this thing to come to an end and i don't care what they're saying you know they can fly to mars and jupiter and everywhere else trying to escape the wrath of god but it won't work it ain't happening it's an illusion they think they're seeing something when they're not one thing i do know i was reading up on that collider the other day and y'all remember the collider the cern sir c-e-r-n that they had over there in switzerland and i didn't know this and i i listened and i thought wow they had a documentary on it and they said the people who was involved began to act strange and said they began to see demons and everything else listen and the devil got these people thinking that what they're seeing is intelligent beings other you understand me coming from and i'm like what is wrong with these people don't think it's something new that's what happened in the days of noah you know what you know what scientist says an asteroid came out of space and hit the earth and the dinosaurs died hey see they're way off but everybody believed that lie when the bible clearly tells us what happens and you know what happened man disbelieved god's word and the judgment of the lord found him you understand me so you say well what do you mean it's it was if it was it was science then and it's science now and it boggles my mind when people think these people in our day think that those people before us was monkeys or some kind of less intelligent and they got all the proof that these people were far more about way above us you understand the pyramids and all of these uh great monuments that was left behind and they didn't have they won't they want to put them in stone age see that's just a lie from the devil those people knew about time and space and dimensions and all these things we're just coming into it it's the same thing that got them in trouble is getting us into in trouble they just was too nosy yeah i know i look like i'm crazy tonight but it's all right i'm trying to tell us that all of the stuff and you're going to say well the people well i just don't know how they did it and we've got a prophet who told us how it was done it was done by laser we're just getting into the laser but they had they had they had already uh conquered this thing so much so that they could cut things and not leave a scratch like a not you know everything was smooth because the laser cut it smooth lifted it up they they had accomplished these things we don't know how to do it and we'll never know how to do it right i mean they got houses and i know i'm off the track for a moment but that's all right i'm trying to explain something how can we believe this science over god science has never been sure it's always guesswork and we we we think oh my god i was telling somebody the other day i said no matter how much you uh how can i say it like i said like the prophet of god said if i cut your arm if you dead and i cut your arm you know what it's going to stay cut it's not going to heal itself i can put all the kind of medication on it i want to and it won't do nothing but rot why because the god that's in you is gone the life of you is out it's life that heals so you say well brother brooks uh you know the the medication and every medication can aid you thank god for that but medication cannot heal there's only one who can heal and that's god and it doesn't matter what you go through the doctors are there to aid and do whatever they can do and many times it's guesswork but nevertheless when you get healed and ain't the doctor is god yeah you're gonna you can you can go around in a circle but at the end of the day it's god who is the healer and that's where the devil is distracting us because we don't know that the word of god is sure the bible says with his stripes we are healed it's true and we can bank on that let me ask you a question if the word of god is not sure how do you know christianity is right you've proven it or god has proved you in it he changed you when you couldn't change yourself hmm this is the record god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that had the son have life eternal and he that have not the son have not life eternal and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world so this is not this life we're living is not by chance it's by predestination it's by selection election god choosing you and where were you before you came here you were in god that's where you were and i if we can these things that we we're now facing when this pressure comes on us when the council of churches and and all of these things come at us what we're going to do you say the bride won't be here yes she will she will not experience the great tribulation but she's going to have a battle brother branham said they will hunt you down yes sir he said but we will escape right he said they're going to come he said the waves may be be tall or big he said but we will crest every one of them don't think you're getting out of here easy it's not it will be god against satan like it was in the beginning you love the lord i hope you're being blessed somehow i'm trying to put an urgency in you i need a greater urgency that that god is soon to come i know it is and the thing is you do not want to move when it's too late i've heard people say well when the squeeze come well the squeeze is just here to prove what you got in you and if you don't have nothing in you there ain't nothing no you squeeze the orange all you want to if there's if it's dry it's dry i noticed a simple message i didn't plan it to be so but this is the way god is bringing it amen and those who have life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world the great royal seed jesus christ was planted he died that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and it's reproducing itself that's what i'm oh man i just don't i want to scream because you got to understand we know these things but somehow we always excuse me want to put our hands to it but we can't reproduce ourselves we can't do it it has to be the life in you it's christ in you the hope of glory it is christ who's doing the work it's not you but my point is this if we're going to make it through this end we won't be able to make it alone religion won't be able to help you family dna can't help you nothing can help you outside of christ himself it has to be and this is where people are looking they figure well i you know i've been born in the message i've been raised in a mess there's no such thing as being born in the message not in a natural sense i don't care if your mama your daddy was a bishop but the point is amen you got to be born again you got to know god for yourself amen oh my daddy and mama was a christian so what that don't make you a christian every individual must meet god for themselves oh god help us nothing can separate us from the love of god and we forget that a love letter like that and we forget it nothing can separate us from the love of god nothing paul said who tribulations famine pestilence whatever don't you understand that sure god that's in you that's surely in you will always stand for you i think about it often times and then those uh hebrew boys if you want to put it that way you know we look at them a natural man and they were until god came on the scene you understand me the natural man ain't gonna challenge a lion uh-uh no sir and and you think about all of those patriots in the in the bible you know killing a thousand here and three thousand you gotta understand these men were anointed that was god you know and when you come to a place he says lord what i'm going through right now you don't understand it but i'm sure you're going to come to my rescue he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete he'll do it but you got to have confidence that he's going to do it he's going to do it and everything that we go through is the bible said the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the law give me one more scripture romans 8 30 says moreover whom he predestinated them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified do you know what justification justification mean that god has justified you you can't justify yourself he justified you and you know how he places by placing his blood in your life for putting his spirit in you that's how you're justified and in that justification he then brings you to a glorification none of us deserve it none of us but i'm trying to bring us to the place if this message is the only thing that's right now you understand me we have obligations we can't let it die and we must fight but not with a natural tool or anything like that spiritual everything must be so what you get kicked down you get knocked down but the bible says a just man rises seven times in a day we must get up we must press the battle we must go forward with this because this is truth the world hates it they hated jesus they put him out of the door and right now they crucified him afresh it's the truth and the thing is you and i he has chosen from the foundation of the world to be a witness that he lives oh lord i like this we may not be what we ought to be we may not be what we want to be but there's one thing we know we're not what we used to be once we found christ and come to the foundation we're not what we used to be there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains i just heard today a brother called me i can't think of the man's name well-known man harvey harvey javi what's harvey what's the newscaster uh harvey yeah maybe i shouldn't have said his name it's too late now but it is a known thing that he actually went to iraq or some one of those countries over there and literally had service with the muslims and said there's more than one way to get to heaven and don't you understand that's the movement babylon bringing everything together to say that there's more than one way well you just called jesus a liar because jesus said there's only one way and jesus said he was the spirit of truth and he said let every man be a liar but my word be true so you look you say everybody's falling let me tell you what the bible said unless let's let's close with this before y'all can stay awake the the bible says the bible says that all will be deceived all all your great hollywood fans and all all will be deceived politicians all will be deceived president popes and everything else all will be deceived whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life do you understand me you understand the ratio to that all to this the small little group that we have here there other places i do i i feel like you know um the way i thought things were going to move didn't go but nevertheless i believe god is speaking because we're at a time where i think we're losing something something is being lost in the process of these trials i told a brother today i said you know when egypt was locked down and y'all heard me say this i say the thing that they wanted to make sure that the blood was applied and i think that's what we should be doing all of us should be examining everything sweeping out all the trash uh you know cleaning up sanctifying ourselves and you know that's been my prayer today my prayer has been lord completely sanctify me if there be any darkness in me if there be anything that i cannot see if there'll be a hidden sin or anything that's hiding please show me so i can clean so this thing could be cleansed i want all of this world out of me even if it means that i lose friends you know what i'm saying there are people worldly friends people i connect with you know christians supposedly but if it means that they got to go then they have to go whatever whatever i i just said that to the lord today whatever it takes for you to be pleased with me in this day i i can't where you're going to turn who can you turn to you understand me this message is right we we don't understand what's coming our way it's what it is everybody think is going to be glorious but let me tell you something before you get that glorious stuff you got to battle you're going to fight you know what david had to fight all the time you know saul those women didn't say well saul a thousand and david ten thousand for nothing they had the battle before the glory came and that's the way it's going to have to be here people of god and think about it if we're losing battles now what's going to be when when it gets really rough see i really believe with the wisdom of this thing is now like i heard somebody say to make sure your prayers become intense like jesus prayer before his great trial he had intense prayer prayer that he he locked himself into a channel and wouldn't come out until god dispatched an angel to strengthen him and i think that's what we need we really need i need it and maybe i'm preaching on myself but i know what i need and that is to have more intense prayers not just for me but for all my brothers and sisters wherever they may be we've got people amen who are suffering physically right now and we supposed to be the almighty church the power of god in us the early church a man didn't even think about doctors you know and the only one doctor that they had which was converted was i think it was uh luke yeah luke i was gonna say timothy but i knew that wasn't right luke and you know but you gotta understand you gotta realize tonight that if we don't get this desperate desperate thing going in our lives we're going to be in trouble because we're moving at a slow pace and i don't think we're supposed to be moving i think that the world is under a spell and we're not careful we'll find ourselves under that same spell of witchcraft thinking everything is going all right and everything is not that's what the devil wants us to believe you know that all is well now if your faith is speaking that that's good but the bible also say examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith father god we come before you lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves forgive us of our sin cleanse us from all our unrighteousness and we pray father god that you'll bless this service bless the people of god bless the hearers and may they see and understand what was being said or what was trying to be said uh lord that we must understand who we are and understand the time and season we in we're in a time of showdown this is where we are and just as sure as the prophet has spoken it it will and shall come to pass help us lord that we'll find ourselves in that place of rest when the wrath of god began to strike us be merciful to us in jesus christ's name we pray amen to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love [Music] like it all through life [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long
