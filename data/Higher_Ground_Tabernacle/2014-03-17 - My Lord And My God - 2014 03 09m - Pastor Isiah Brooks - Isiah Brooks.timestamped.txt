[1:20] Lord but Thomas one of the 12 called
[1:25] dmus was not with them when Jesus came
[1:29] that the other the disciples therefore
[1:31] said unto him we have seen the
[1:33] Lord but he said unto them except I
[1:36] shall see in his hands the prince of the
[1:39] nails and put my finger into the print
[1:42] of the nails and thrust my hand into his
[1:45] side I will not
[1:48] believe and after eight days again his
[1:52] disciples were within and Thomas with
[1:56] them then came Jesus the doors being
[2:00] shut and stood in the midst and said
[2:05] Peace be unto
[2:08] you remember eight days later
[2:11] now then said he to
[2:13] Thomas reach hither thy finger and

[9:18] again sure we love the
[9:21] Lord we thank him for his Amazing
[9:28] Grace
[9:32] is is
[9:35] amazing we're
[9:37] living in the time
[9:40] of
[9:44] translation the Holy Spirit has been
[9:48] here for
[9:52] us but we need to be here for
[9:57] him we are living in a
[10:00] time things are moving so
[10:05] fast but nothing has
[10:08] occurred by
[10:11] chance everything has been
[10:15] predestinated well
[10:17] planned by
[10:21] God and just think about it you and I
[10:24] are hard we're part of this plan God
[10:28] just didn't
[10:29] throw in some things to see whether it
[10:32] would
[10:34] fit but he well planned this
[10:37] thing and even though it may
[10:40] seem like the enemy is perhaps getting
[10:43] the best of
[10:45] you there is no way that he can
[10:49] Triumph because that was also
[10:53] planned and the victory has already been
[10:58] won now we want to say that we have all
[11:03] declared Jesus Christ as our
[11:07] savior but I wonder as a brother said to
[11:10] me the other day God was showing him you
[11:14] you know this but how much do you know
[11:16] about me what is it that you know about
[11:20] me uh that can give you the
[11:24] assurance and the Bold stand that we
[11:27] could read in the old test men and see
[11:29] how these men who were like you and I
[11:33] were able to stand in times of
[11:38] adversities No
[11:40] Doubt but they were able to hold fast
[11:45] their faith and their
[11:48] integrity in a time when most men would
[11:51] have
[11:53] failed but what the difference was and
[11:56] is is that their Faith had become come
[12:01] sight in other words spiritually they
[12:04] knew who they were
[12:06] serving and they understood that the god
[12:10] that they served was God Amen but we
[12:14] find out amen that there are so many
[12:17] Christians who follow
[12:20] Christ with their mouth they believe he
[12:23] is but in their
[12:26] hearts they haven't come to know him as
[12:31] God now we find out that Phillip was uh
[12:36] Thomas was one of the the disciples that
[12:38] followed Jesus three and a half
[12:41] years no doubt he was in the mixture
[12:44] when Jesus told him about the
[12:47] crucifixion how he was to die how he was
[12:50] to rise again but for whatever reason
[12:53] Thomas had a spirit of of unbelief he
[12:56] had a hard time having
[13:00] faith in the words of Jesus
[13:03] Christ he was there no doubt when they
[13:06] called him to uh question and when they
[13:10] captured him in the Garden of Eden uh
[13:13] excuse me uh uh
[13:15] Gethsemane and we find out by the grace
[13:18] of God Amen Thomas was one of the ones
[13:21] that
[13:22] scattered but at the
[13:26] resurrection Jesus began to appear to
[13:29] some of his
[13:30] disciples they saw him prior to his
[13:33] death turn water into wine they saw him
[13:37] Open the Eyes of the blind there was one
[13:40] by the name of Peter who who walked upon
[13:44] water because he said God if this be you
[13:47] B me come and he said come so they had
[13:50] seen the
[13:51] miraculous they had never seen any man
[13:55] do such a thing like this man was doing
[13:59] so much so they were on the
[14:01] sea and the enemy amen was in the
[14:04] mixture of the waves and the clouds and
[14:06] the winds and the Bible tells us amen
[14:09] that that that this ship that these
[14:12] people were in they were about to sink
[14:15] at least that's what they thought but
[14:18] Jesus was in the midst of the
[14:20] boat and they cried out Master carth
[14:24] thou not that we perish see there was
[14:28] still element of God or Jesus Christ
[14:31] they didn't see they saw him as a
[14:34] miracle worker but could he do this this
[14:37] is the elements of the of of the
[14:39] atmosphere this is not just a a a man or
[14:43] or a child but this is something we
[14:45] can't see it's invisible something's
[14:47] moving this thing and can he Christ amen
[14:51] put an end to this
[14:53] situation and then when he got up he
[14:56] stood up like a man in in the boat but
[14:59] he stood up like a man and he rebuked
[15:02] the winds he rebuked the waves and said
[15:05] peace be still and his disciples still
[15:09] didn't get it they said what manner of
[15:14] man is
[15:16] this at that point in time they didn't
[15:19] see a man it wasn't a man that spoke to
[15:23] the wind it was God Almighty that spoke
[15:26] to the wind but in their mind they said
[15:30] what manner of man brother said he got
[15:32] it they got it wrong even
[15:36] then and now we find him
[15:40] resurrected in a place by the grace of
[15:43] God where you know the disciples most of
[15:46] them didn't believe at first but Jesus
[15:49] had to visibly show them because
[15:52] remember amen when Mary ran to the
[15:54] disciples and said he's alive he's
[15:57] alive they say surely something's wrong
[16:00] with
[16:01] you you must have seen something
[16:03] different you know I know you
[16:05] emotionally stirred but how could it be
[16:08] but remember he said yes sir after the
[16:12] third day
[16:13] Hallelujah I Rise
[16:16] Again see he wanted to show them that
[16:19] Not only was he the son of man Not only
[16:22] was he uh uh the Christ but he was
[16:26] godall the Bible tells me that he didn't
[16:30] knock at the door 8 days before he came
[16:33] through the wall or came through the
[16:35] door he heard what thas said Hallelujah
[16:38] come on somebody that's my Lord that's
[16:41] my God Amen the Bible said he even knows
[16:44] the secrets of the heart the very intent
[16:47] of your heart God already
[16:49] knows you see we're not serving a
[16:52] denominational God people we are we're
[16:55] serving the true and living God who is
[16:58] Jesus Christ himself somebody amen this
[17:00] morning got to know what I'm talking
[17:03] about amen so we find out amen he comes
[17:06] through the door and he didn't he didn't
[17:09] address nobody else he comes right to
[17:13] Thomas and he said Thomas in other words
[17:16] I heard what you said eight days ago
[17:20] Hallelujah but I want you to know amen
[17:24] who I am so I'm going to put you to the
[17:27] test Thomas and right now I don't need
[17:29] your unbelief you're not seeing a spirit
[17:33] you're seeing a God man and he said
[17:36] listen I want you to thrust your hands
[17:38] into my wounds into my side and I want
[17:41] you to leave amen after Thomas did that
[17:44] Thomas questions were answered he said
[17:47] my Lord and my God now listen amen it
[17:52] took all of that for Thomas to see that
[17:56] he was Lord and God Amen when all of the
[17:59] other disciples had already four random
[18:02] is that right they saw him as being Lord
[18:05] and God hallelujah come on somebody amen
[18:08] he said don't be afraid this is not a
[18:10] spirit give me some fish Hallelujah can
[18:13] a f can a spirit eat like this see y'all
[18:16] looking at me like I'm crazy but let me
[18:19] put it this way a lot of us don't know
[18:21] him like that some of us still got
[18:24] Thomas's amen the spirit of Thomas
[18:26] anointing us and we've got a find a way
[18:29] out of this
[18:33] thing but he said to Thomas blessed is
[18:35] the one who have not seen and yet
[18:39] believe so now the Bible said blessed
[18:42] are they those of those those who follow
[18:44] you Thomas who have not seen this but
[18:47] believe blessed is a man who's never
[18:50] believed or seen the PF fire but believe
[18:52] it blessed is a man who's never seen the
[18:55] cloud but believe it blessed is a man
[18:57] who's not seen in the son of man but
[18:59] believe it blessed is that
[19:04] man
[19:07] hallelujah what do you know about
[19:11] him you know he's my
[19:14] savior a lot of
[19:16] times we fail to see he's more than
[19:20] [Music]
[19:22] that surely he's our savior but I want
[19:26] to say this this morning he's God
[19:29] the Bible said listen I want you to
[19:30] listen carefully the word of God said
[19:33] there is no other God beside him so
[19:39] everything else is either wnab
[19:41] bees everything else is imposters or
[19:44] however you want to put it but there's
[19:45] only one
[19:47] God oh it's the truth the Bible tells us
[19:52] amen that there is no other name
[19:55] according to Acts 4:12 that a man could
[19:58] be saved but the name of Jesus Christ
[20:01] now we want to lift that name we want to
[20:04] raise that name this morning you see
[20:07] that's the problem we haven't been
[20:08] working the name we haven't been raising
[20:11] the name Hallelujah but there is no
[20:13] other
[20:15] name like I was talking with a brother
[20:17] and I say it all the time you can say
[20:19] God you can say Allah you can say buha
[20:21] but don't say
[20:24] Jesus Hallelujah and I want you to
[20:27] understand that demons are not even
[20:29] afraid to that name until you put it all
[20:31] together you got to say in the name of
[20:33] Jesus
[20:34] Christ because there's a lot of jesuses
[20:37] out there Hallelujah now I know what I'm
[20:40] talking about I didn't understand it
[20:42] when I was a younger fellow a younger
[20:43] Christian but I could remember for
[20:45] whatever reason I see things at times I
[20:48] could remember laying on my bed there in
[20:50] my house there in in Columbia South
[20:52] Carina and a demon I saw it coming
[20:53] before I could get up I wasn't asleep I
[20:55] was wide awake and that thing P pinned
[20:57] me down the most hideous thing I ever
[20:59] seen in my life and I kept praying God
[21:03] whatever that is don't let it into me
[21:06] you know and then what happened is I
[21:08] said amen I finally got y'all know how
[21:10] it closes your mouth anybody know what
[21:12] I'm talking about when you're attacked
[21:13] by a demon oh y'all act like y'all don't
[21:16] know I hope you don't ever have to find
[21:18] that one out cuz it ain't a it ain't a
[21:19] nice feeling amen and anyway I was
[21:22] trying to get the name of Jesus I got
[21:24] the name of Jesus out that demon didn't
[21:26] even move you see was I was still in
[21:29] denomination I was calling on that
[21:33] Jesus Hallelujah come on come on if it
[21:37] doesn't make a difference why did the
[21:40] Sons of ska say I want to call on the
[21:42] name of the god that Paul
[21:45] preach see because you got to understand
[21:47] there's a difference in Jesus and in the
[21:51] real
[21:53] Jesus and that's the thing that's wrong
[21:56] with people a lot of us are still
[21:58] calling on a denomination of Jesus when
[22:00] the revelation of the true Jesus Christ
[22:03] has
[22:05] come I L somebody I wouldn't I couldn't
[22:08] move but when I said in the name of
[22:11] Jesus Christ that things went away
[22:13] Hallelujah it burst it moves so fast it
[22:17] moved faster than it
[22:19] came Hallelujah there's power in the
[22:21] name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah come on
[22:25] somebody but nevertheless there's no
[22:27] other name given among men where we must
[22:30] be saved by the name of Jesus what does
[22:33] he mean to you who is he to you even
[22:37] Christ himself in the book of Isaiah
[22:39] 433rd verse chapter 11th verse he say I
[22:43] even I am the Lord and beside me there
[22:47] is no savior Hallelujah mama can't save
[22:51] you Daddy can't save you no religion can
[22:54] save you the only person that can truly
[22:57] save you is the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:59] himself this might sound a little
[23:01] Elementary to you but I'm working with
[23:04] the seals right now I'm working with
[23:06] that that that Revelation that was open
[23:08] to us that we didn't know we had to have
[23:11] a prophet to come out and say come out
[23:13] of her my people and be not partaker of
[23:15] her sin because she's not
[23:18] worshiping Hallelujah she's not
[23:21] worshiping the true Lord Jesus Christ
[23:23] Hallelujah she's been led into an
[23:26] illusion she don't even know what she's
[23:30] worshiping Hallelujah come on somebody
[23:34] now I want you to understand we in this
[23:36] last day needed an entrance and you and
[23:39] I would have never known he we we saw
[23:41] him in the Book of Revelation the thir
[23:43] chapter knocking at the door trying to
[23:45] get into your heart Hallelujah you know
[23:48] in the church age had done put him out
[23:50] but he said whosoever will whosoever
[23:53] would open up this door he said I come
[23:55] into you and I serer Hallelujah what was
[23:58] it it was the door of your heart
[24:00] Hallelujah is that right we didn't
[24:02] realize but brother Bram amen he comes
[24:04] along and he actually interprets the
[24:06] interprets the
[24:08] painting of the hofman head knocking at
[24:11] the door come on he said the he said the
[24:13] latch wasn't on the outside Jesus ain't
[24:16] going to just open your door you've got
[24:18] the latch you've got the the ability to
[24:20] open the door to Jesus So when you say
[24:23] Lord Jesus come in you must make sure
[24:25] that the door is open amen
[24:30] glory to God is that all right then we
[24:33] come and find out amen that without this
[24:36] message you don't know the way in right
[24:40] huh we didn't understand that Peter was
[24:42] was telling us amen that God had made an
[24:45] entrance that there was a Ministry
[24:48] coming that God would open up the door
[24:51] and wake a way for us to enter into him
[24:53] Hallelujah he to enter into how however
[24:56] you want to look look at it because here
[24:58] Peter second Peter said amen 1114 so an
[25:00] ENT shall be ministered unto you
[25:04] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[25:08] and without Malachi 4 you and I would
[25:11] have never known the
[25:15] entrance we would have been out listen
[25:18] we do that they came to the door even
[25:20] the foolish virgins but they had no way
[25:23] of going
[25:24] in because they rejected oh come on
[25:27] somebody
[25:28] the key to the
[25:30] door is that all right amen we find out
[25:34] by the grace of God Amen this interest
[25:36] was made unto us that after we believe
[25:40] after we receive that we will be sealed
[25:43] Hallelujah a process of God Amen must
[25:47] take place amen oh in your
[25:51] hearts Hallelujah ain't God good to us
[25:56] hallelujah I've got a quotee here I want
[25:58] to read in just a moment but I don't
[26:00] want to get ahead of myself because I

[27:28] Souls that are in prison Souls who are
[27:31] demon-possessed come on somebody wait a
[27:33] minute wait a minute let me show you
[27:35] something I I stumbled at this scripture
[27:37] the other day I I didn't when I say
[27:38] stumbled stumbled on it if Psalms 58 3-5
[27:43] says even from birth the wicked go
[27:47] astray from the womb they are wward and
[27:51] speak
[27:52] lies see from
[27:56] birth you Wicked from birth you just
[27:59] don't oh that little cute little angel
[28:02] he might or she might look like an angel
[28:04] but whatever the seeds in her will
[28:07] determine what she'll
[28:09] be y'all hear what I'm saying if she got
[28:12] a bad seed in the beginning that's what
[28:14] you have in the
[28:18] end oh come on
[28:20] somebody oh it's the truth said their
[28:23] venom is like the Venom of a snake in
[28:26] one place it said like a
[28:29] Cobra that has stopped his
[28:32] ears you know how people amen they can
[28:34] come and they can pretend like they're
[28:36] hearing and you know they're not hearing
[28:39] because their ears are
[28:41] stopped and no matter how the charmer
[28:44] tried to charm them amen no matter how
[28:46] skillful the preacher is they will not
[28:51] obey that's just the way it
[28:56] is that's the way it
[28:59] is because you know they like I say
[29:02] snakes most of them they don't hear
[29:04] anyway that's why you better be glad you
[29:06] got ears to
[29:08] hear oh Lord what do you know of him
[29:12] it's something that have knowledge of
[29:14] we've got knowledge of the
[29:17] president and the things what we've
[29:19] heard maybe some we don't like some of
[29:21] us but knowledge is one thing but to
[29:25] know him is a different thing
[29:28] and there are so many Christians that
[29:30] have knowledge of him but they don't
[29:33] know him do you know him do you know
[29:38] him I heard a song say he's the son of
[29:41] David the Seed of Abraham Stone him out
[29:44] the mountain he's a Meek and humble lamb
[29:46] do you know him he'll wash your tears
[29:49] away he'll turn your night into Day do
[29:53] you know him see and that's the thing
[29:56] and then the question is has always been
[29:58] do you know him but now I'm bringing it
[30:01] to a deeper point do he know
[30:07] you
[30:08] Hallelujah see God like I said didn't
[30:11] just do this thing he did it in such a
[30:13] powerful way now I want you to
[30:16] understand every one of us are going
[30:17] through some TR type of
[30:19] transition it might like you see may
[30:21] seem like your life is at its worst
[30:23] right now but so it was with
[30:26] Samson
[30:27] and he looked at this thing with the
[30:29] possibility said I I I got to go for it
[30:32] Hallelujah it might be the only chance I
[30:34] have and this is where God is putting
[30:36] you right there with a possibility you
[30:39] at your worst point but there's a
[30:41] possibility you can do
[30:44] better Hallelujah he took that
[30:47] possibility and said listen it's going
[30:50] to cause my death and like I said in my
[30:53] Sunday school people well if you commit
[30:55] suicide you're going to hell that's not
[30:57] true Samson committed
[31:02] suicide and he said purposely I'll die
[31:05] with the
[31:08] Enemy Hallelujah he knew what he was
[31:11] doing he knew the battle was going to
[31:13] cause his death Hallelujah and he died
[31:17] with the
[31:20] Enemy and that's what God is saying to
[31:22] you this morning amen you must die with
[31:25] your enemy even if look like it's
[31:28] suicide to yourself die with your
[31:31] enemy cuz every one of us got one or two
[31:34] or three or four or
[31:38] five huh you know what's troubling you
[31:42] you know what's holding you back come on
[31:44] somebody well I don't know you do know
[31:47] why because it's God's purpose to let
[31:49] you know he purposed you like he did
[31:53] Samson destroy the Philistine and
[31:55] whatever demons are
[31:57] disturbing you tormenting you you have
[32:00] been ordained to destroy
[32:03] it amen and if you don't destroy it it

[53:10] him but now they know him Hallelujah
[53:13] they understood that this God we're
[53:15] serving is not something of a the
[53:17] figment of our imagination he's real how
[53:21] I saw him there he was in the fire with
[53:23] me Hallelujah
[53:29] oo oo oo Hallelujah that's why Daniel
[53:32] paid three times a day Daniel knew what
[53:34] he was talking about Daniel knew what he
[53:36] was working with hallelujah amen he
[53:38] wasn't just working like all those other
[53:40] children of Israel who who said oh we
[53:42] believe in the Jehovah God Daniel knew
[53:44] it and the Jehovah God knew Daniel
[53:46] Hallelujah that's what I'm saying I
[53:48] don't want to just know him but I want
[53:50] him to know me
[53:52] hallelujah amen cuz there's a lot of
[53:54] people he going to say I do not know
[53:57] you Hallelujah ain't God good to us oh
[54:01] my anybody know what it means to be
[54:03] delivered see all that all that in that
[54:06] word savior I I'm going to be preaching
[54:08] on this for a while so you might as well
[54:09] know where I'm working with because a
[54:11] lot of us we got to know him and we
[54:13] we're failing to see him through our
[54:15] trials we think our trials the devil is
[54:17] bringing amen these things on us to God
[54:20] is bringing the on us to punish us no no
[54:22] no he's allowing these things to come up
[54:25] us so you'll know him better you'll know
[54:28] him better as a deliverer as a savior as
[54:31] a friend as a
[54:34] comforter that's why you're going
[54:36] through it knowing him and most of us
[54:40] are missing
[54:43] it we're failing to see that the trials
[54:46] are to bring you closer to God not drive
[54:48] you
[54:50] away is that right Peter exemplified
[54:53] that situation in the midst of a storm
[54:57] saw Jesus walking on the water in the
[54:59] midst of the storm Lord if that be you
[55:02] draw me closer bring me to you Lord
[55:05] hallelujah let me come to
[55:08] you like that brother said when God
[55:11] saved Peter from drowning he didn't have
[55:13] to run out there and pull him out of the
[55:15] water he was right there when Peter lost
[55:17] face he was right in the reach of our
[55:18] arms
[55:19] Lane and many times we fail when God is
[55:22] right there to grab us we fail God
[55:26] thank God he don't give up on us like we
[55:28] so easily give up on
[55:30] him is that all right Psalms 1247 says
[55:35] out of our soul is escaped as a bird out
[55:38] of the snare of the
[55:40] foul we were all in
[55:43] prison all trapped by the devil come on
[55:46] somebody and God came and broke this
[55:48] broke the snare hey Lord I love that I
[55:51] love that I love that I love that amen
[55:53] because if you know anything about you
[55:55] know over there when we would go see
[55:56] Brian Jones and he would find those
[55:58] animals all trapped by these pores and
[56:01] stuff like that you know yeah they'll be
[56:03] wounded they sometime the foot be done
[56:05] you know because of the Trap wounded and
[56:07] broken you know all kind of situations
[56:09] but he'd take them home and nurse them
[56:11] back to
[56:12] hell that's a real Savior and he got you
[56:15] out of the Trap before Satan returned to
[56:17] kill you hallelujah amen ain't God
[56:21] good he's Lord he's God Hal huah and he
[56:25] wants you to know we must come to know
[56:28] that not in our hands in our
[56:33] hearts and believe that scripture that
[56:35] the footsteps of a righteous man is
[56:36] ordered by the lord well brother BRS I
[56:38] don't think I'm righteous you better be
[56:41] you better be he became my sin that I
[56:43] might become the righteousness of God if
[56:45] he took my sin that means I'm his
[56:47] righteousness therefore he looked upon
[56:49] me as I'm a righteous man so therefore
[56:51] he orders my steps oh he couldn't have
[56:54] taken me this way he took you this way
[56:56] he's taking you the way he's taking you
[56:59] don't Grumble don't complain Lead Me Oh
[57:02] Lord lead
[57:06] me my Lord and my
[57:11] God man man my born blind Hallelujah
[57:16] think about it think about it you love
[57:19] the Lord let me read this amen let's go
[57:23] to Psalms 8:22
[57:26] now I I want you to really think about
[57:28] what was preached this morning because
[57:29] I'mma I'mma add more I'mma bring some
[57:31] more to it this evening but I want you
[57:33] to understand amen that you're not some
[57:37] mishap you know you're not like a Daren
[57:40] Theory you know you came to being by
[57:43] chance you know I I I don't even know
[57:45] how they happen to believe that because
[57:47] amen what what taphole or whatever that
[57:50] crawled up which one of them became male
[57:53] first and then how can it be by chance
[57:56] amen because if it was female who
[57:58] pregnated her to bring forth a male it
[58:00] doesn't make sense then God just happen
[58:03] to to to to make a male and female go
[58:06] through the same changes at the same
[58:08] [Music]
[58:09] time I wish that people understood what
[58:12] they were saying amen taking you all the
[58:15] way to a tap pole you are related to a
[58:17] tap
[58:19] pole that makes no sense but that's what
[58:23] people believe that the that's the
[58:25] insanity that Satan is striking the
[58:28] people with they believ in science over
[58:30] the
[58:33] word like I said yeah I believe in The
[58:35] Big Bang Theory but that was after he
[58:36] said let there
[58:40] be amen so you love the Lord Proverbs
[58:44] 8:22 says the Lord possessed me in the
[58:46] beginning of his way before his works of
[58:49] old I will set up from the Everlasting
[58:53] from the beginning of or even the Earth
[58:55] was when there was no depths I was
[58:58] brought forth when there were uh no
[59:01] fountains uh abounding with waters
[59:04] before the mountains were settled before
[59:07] the hills was I brought forth now you
[59:11] got to understand amen that had to be
[59:13] scripture somewhere about predestination
[59:16] that's not just talking about Jesus
[59:18] Christ that's talking about you too why
[59:20] because you were in
[59:23] him
[59:25] you were in him before the foundations
[59:28] of the
[59:32] world I'mma tell you just like this
[59:34] people the only reason why you could
[59:36] ever be holy and that if the Holy Ghost
[59:38] is on you or in you right there is no
[59:42] one of us amen that's holier than thou
[59:45] no
[59:47] sir everybody got to come by the way of
[59:50] the
[59:50] blood but do you know what I'm talking
[59:53] about y'all know what I'm talking about
[59:54] some you know we look at and everybody
[59:56] got this you know and that's the saddest
[59:58] thing this is where Satan is deceiving a
[1:00:00] lot of people in our day because he's
[1:00:01] making you think that knowledge is the
[1:00:03] Holy
[1:00:06] Ghost Paul said you can understand all
[1:00:09] the
[1:00:09] Mysteries and have not charity which is
[1:00:12] the Holy Ghost it will profit you
[1:00:15] nothing you don't even have a
[1:00:18] covenant see but a lot of people don't
[1:00:20] want to believe that oh I know I I know
[1:00:22] it I know it where in your
[1:00:25] or in your heart if it's in your heart
[1:00:27] it's working its way out of
[1:00:30] you it's going to work its way out of
[1:00:32] you but if you just got it in your head
[1:00:34] it's not going to last how many of us
[1:00:37] forget
[1:00:39] sometime and y'all know
[1:00:42] me if it wasn't for God I don't know
[1:00:45] where I'd be y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:00:48] amen so you got to realize I must depend
[1:00:51] upon him not
[1:00:53] me
[1:00:55] I'm not complaining I'm so glad he made
[1:00:57] me the way he's made me because I know
[1:00:59] when I get to heaven it was all
[1:01:02] God oh God nothing I did nothing I
[1:01:06] merited I I didn't run no win no contest
[1:01:09] it was the grace of God you love the
[1:01:13] Lord he possessed me he possessed me I
[1:01:17] was already
[1:01:19] there huh you said brother said anybody
[1:01:23] remember I asked a boy I asked a guy
[1:01:26] like this we had a conversation when was
[1:01:27] in the denomination and you know what I
[1:01:29] someone believe him now but he said he
[1:01:31] said 'oh I remember when I was in my
[1:01:33] mother's womb I could remember all the
[1:01:35] colors and things but I couldn't believe
[1:01:37] that because at the first I thought
[1:01:38] there's no light but then I found out
[1:01:41] there is
[1:01:44] light I don't understand it but I can
[1:01:46] tell you what I can remember when I was
[1:01:48] in diapers anybody
[1:01:53] else I could remember when I was in
[1:01:56] diapers now why I could remember things
[1:01:58] like that and then my short term is so
[1:02:05] short hallelujah oh yeah I remember
[1:02:09] laying on the floor on a pallet looking
[1:02:11] up when a man was coming through my my
[1:02:13] my my window breaking into our house I
[1:02:16] could remember my when my sisters were
[1:02:18] screaming I remember
[1:02:21] it I remember y'all think I I tell you
[1:02:24] the truth
[1:02:24] I was four years old playing
[1:02:27] hookie from
[1:02:32] kindergarten that's right didn't want to
[1:02:34] go there for personal
[1:02:38] reasons but I unlock my window at
[1:02:42] home stand at the like they had a
[1:02:45] screening porch I go in the screening
[1:02:46] porch and act like I was knocking on the
[1:02:48] door while my mom going to the bus stop
[1:02:50] to catch the
[1:02:53] bus and when she would leave or turn
[1:02:56] that corner I'm back out the door going
[1:02:58] into my house in the window four years
[1:03:02] old not even in in in elementary
[1:03:11] yet so I know you can go really way
[1:03:17] back y y y'all think I'm crazy but I'll
[1:03:21] put it this way let me tell you like
[1:03:22] this and I won't go in depth to but my
[1:03:25] grandson Christopher can remember when
[1:03:26] he was a baby in the nursery he told me
[1:03:30] I didn't believe him then Christopher
[1:03:32] came out with something that only God
[1:03:34] could have showed
[1:03:36] it made a Believer out of
[1:03:39] it made a Believer out of me so you got
[1:03:43] to realize amen there are things that we
[1:03:45] do remember now think about it we're in
[1:03:47] the image of likeness of
[1:03:51] God God remembers all things
[1:03:55] not really he don't remember your
[1:03:58] sins I shouldn't have done that but the
[1:04:01] point is amen you and I must recognize
[1:04:05] by the grace of God Amen that God
[1:04:08] remember he can never forget that's what
[1:04:10] he said right he said I'll never forget
[1:04:12] you how can I forget you you graving in
[1:04:15] the palms of my hand Hallelujah but I'm
[1:04:18] going tell you something the moment you
[1:04:20] switch over and you believe it's your
[1:04:23] works that save you you are
[1:04:27] lost y'all hear what I'm saying the
[1:04:30] moment you switch over and believe it's
[1:04:32] your works that save you you are lost we
[1:04:35] do the works of God because we are
[1:04:41] saved a cow give milk not to prove it's
[1:04:44] a
[1:04:44] cow it gives milk because it is a
[1:04:49] cow and you and I must recognize oh you
[1:04:52] said why am I saying this because the
[1:04:54] the devil takes your joy by stripping
[1:04:56] you making you faulty you going to
[1:04:58] always be faulty till Jesus come it is
[1:05:01] the soul man that God is looking at it
[1:05:04] is where the blood is laying on the
[1:05:06] altar in your heart that's what God's
[1:05:09] looking
[1:05:10] at your flesh is your flesh come on
[1:05:14] somebody can anybody stop
[1:05:16] aging I don't care how much cream you
[1:05:19] put on
[1:05:21] it it's going to happen
[1:05:26] right so my point is can you stop the fs
[1:05:29] in your in your flesh it's sticky it's
[1:05:32] going to always be but God said don't
[1:05:34] even look at that look at the inner man
[1:05:36] it's what I'm working on right now in
[1:05:38] you is the Inner
[1:05:42] Man and the only way you can stop that
[1:05:44] thing is to crucify him every
[1:05:48] day you love the Lord amen can I read
[1:05:52] just one more scripture we we we pick up
[1:05:55] this
[1:05:56] evening now this is what I love Isaiah
[1:05:58] 4011 I'm saying this because I really
[1:06:01] want you to uh come to the place and say
[1:06:04] God I got to know you I really have to
[1:06:07] know you it's not enough to know you in
[1:06:10] my head and be able to quote the
[1:06:12] scriptures and quote the prophet
[1:06:14] whatever the case may be but I got to
[1:06:17] know you and it's no different than what
[1:06:19] Paul requested he said I don't I don't
[1:06:22] just want to know you in the power of
[1:06:23] your resur Direction he said I want to
[1:06:24] know you in your
[1:06:26] suffering I want to know that Lord I
[1:06:28] want to I want to see you come on the
[1:06:29] scene I want to say Amen when I was here
[1:06:31] you was there you know I want to know I
[1:06:34] want to say Lord now when I was in this
[1:06:36] pit you brought me up come on somebody I
[1:06:38] want to I want to be able to testify
[1:06:40] amen of all the things you've done for
[1:06:42] me I can declare that you was with me
[1:06:44] you never Le me never left me you were
[1:06:46] always there for me see that that that's
[1:06:48] what God wants us to see he wants us to
[1:06:51] have
[1:06:53] confidence
[1:06:55] I just believe that I believe that
[1:06:59] Isaiah 4011 said he shall feed his flock
[1:07:02] Like a
[1:07:03] Shepherd he should gather the Lambs with
[1:07:06] his arm and carry them in his bosom and
[1:07:10] shall gently lead them that are with
[1:07:14] young so even mothers and fathers amen
[1:07:17] those of us we God is leading you God is
[1:07:20] directing us hallelujah come on he's God
[1:07:24] and let me tell you something the
[1:07:25] problem is we're not always aware he's
[1:07:28] around and he's always
[1:07:33] around think about it you feel bad
[1:07:36] because You' done
[1:07:39] wrong he proved to us that he don't go
[1:07:42] nowhere he said Peter before they before
[1:07:45] the C cck Clow three times you deny
[1:07:49] me he was looking right at Peter when
[1:07:52] Peter was making all of those Den
[1:07:54] denal he look right at you when you make
[1:07:57] all those denials but one thing for
[1:08:00] certain he can't deny
[1:08:02] you he didn't say oh Peter you did this
[1:08:04] and because of that I'm taking the keys
[1:08:06] no sir he knew that Peter was going to
[1:08:08] do it before he gave him the
[1:08:10] keys y'all hear what I'm saying I'm
[1:08:12] talking about election now I'm talking
[1:08:14] about election we got to we got to work
[1:08:16] with that because a lot of time a mean
[1:08:18] the devil take our joy because we forget
[1:08:21] election we forget amen that we're just
[1:08:23] Justified as though we never sin in the
[1:08:26] first place we forget that he did that
[1:08:29] the god you
[1:08:30] serve and he want us to be full of
[1:08:35] joy he'll lead us he knows how he's
[1:08:39] leading you well I made a mistake well
[1:08:42] sure you did you think God didn't know
[1:08:45] it you think God wasn't there when it
