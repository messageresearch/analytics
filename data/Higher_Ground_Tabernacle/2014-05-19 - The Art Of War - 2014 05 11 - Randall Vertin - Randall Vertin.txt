TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what you're going through no matter how hurting you may be no matter what condition you may be in he deserves all the free if job can praise god and ash heap scraping boils with a broken piece of a pot then surely i don't see any of us in a condition like that this morning amen we ought to be able to praise god no matter what situation we're in there's no excuses amen we ought to we're gonna have we got more reason to praise him than the angels the angels don't have a choice they made their choice the ones that are damned or damned the ones that will be there will be there but you have a choice this morning to praise god they were created just to praise god that's what they do but this morning god receives your praise as an even greater sacrifice this morning because you do it not because you were just created to do that which you were but god so much loved you gave you the choice i mean how would you like it if you were married or to a husband or wife that would just pro if you were married to a robot who had no choice but to love you do you love me yes i love you but that's how people think it is christians so many times are like that because they think that god is going to just program them the holy ghost now the holy ghost will program you to praise god but it'll come from a pure and perfect heart amen we are we got to give god more praise whether whether it's how it doesn't matter how loud you shout how how great you sing or how loud you sing it's not about that but the praises that you give to god is a consecrated holy life before him every day ought to be a praise to the name of jesus christ not just words can say so many things we've heard people say a lot of things but how many people does their life back it up how many people when when when they claim they believe jesus christ really want to serve jesus christ see many people want to escape hell but how many people really want to serve god that's the question everybody's looking for an escape but how many people once they get to that escape actually want to serve god not many because we find out that as soon as they i'm kind of going on a totally different subject for just a second here but we'll get into the word in a moment but how many people we see go find that escape and then they just run around doing whatever they want to do why because they've cleared their conscience at least their carnal mind conscience and now they just went around doing whatever they want to do but we want to have a pure and holy heart before god that every day we wake up our desire is to give him everything we have for that day it's not enough to come to church every day in your life ought to be a church service because your life is preaching every single day you walk out that door even when you don't walk out the door your life's preaching inside your household to your children to your husband to your wife and even if nobody's there even if you're not married and you live alone your life's preaching back to god himself so you've always got an audience there's always a sermon being preached when you wake up but the question is what is that sermon preaching not even the subject we're going on who knows the lord might take us that way it's the anointing of god takes you wherever he wants to go let's open our bibles please to joshua chapter 18. we want to speak this morning on possession preach this message by the grace of god over for the cam smith's church just a i believe it was last week man time flies by it doesn't it it feels in one instance it feels like it was a year ago and another instance feels like it was yesterday but that's the truth of the matter is time and eternity are starting to blend together so we're going to go to joshua 18 and we're going to read just a couple verses here 18 verse 1 and we're going to read verse 1 through 3 if that's all right by the grace of god amen how many happy to be in the house of god this morning i didn't forget it's mother's day so god bless all the mothers out there all the mothers future tense present tense past tense everything in between you know the lord that's a special blessing you know bro we we've heard our prophet say he said he said the women the sisters think they don't have a special place but i believe we've heard a priest before you know brother branham actually said that the woman in many ways has a greater blessing to be had on the other side because of the the place that she holds it's such a powerful place if it's held by the holy ghost amen so let's just read joshua 18 verses one through three he says and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them i like that the land was subdued before them amen and there yet and they remained among the children of israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye slack to go possess the land which the lord god of your fathers hath given you amen that's the question kind of we want to ask this morning how long are you slack to go possess the land amen and let's also turn over to second corinthians second corinthians chapter 10 please we're going to speak on possession but we kind of want to have a subtitle for this morning if we could we want to speak on the art of war amen because we're in a war some some people haven't really joined it yet some people don't know what's going on but we're at war brothers and sisters there's no doubt about that every day you wake up you know i was telling the congregation over there in ohio you know i've been reading that fox's book of martyrs and they had a war they were fighting now there's there's it seemed it showed itself much more in the natural sense you know those people had hooks put through their flesh lord forgive me i'm not trying to be graphic but we need to understand what we're fighting and we have to understand those same devils are here but they're just in a spiritual form those people were roasted on irons like a egg they were the children cut out of women's bellies while they were still alive and the baby killed right before the mother we're in a battle those spirits are still here don't don't you don't you believe we're not in a battle brothers and sisters second corinthians chapter 10 we're gonna verses three through four it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds amen amen how we believe we serve almighty god amen his weapons are mighty amen his soldiers are mighty amen let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer gracious heavenly father lord jesus we've read your word this morning lord we place this service lord that you've given us here this morning lord to preach and for the the here to hear lord we want to give it all back to you this morning father lord we have we don't have anything lord that we haven't received from you and lord we want to give it back to you as a love offering we give our lives as a love offering lord we give our words and our thoughts and our emotions lord is a love offering to you bring them all into subjection to your word this morning father may you go forth in a power and demonstration lord as it was in the days of old in the book of acts father for you are the same yesterday today and forever father and we're not going to settle for anything less than the pure holy ghost oh god that fell on the day of pentecost to live once again in your people of this hour lord we're looking for that time and lord we believe it is even now lord we love you and we appreciate you father we just pray you bless everyone in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated we just want to speak this morning on on possession we read there in in joshua chapter 18 he's talking about if we could paraphrase that scripture in our modern day english he says how long are you slack and if we want to if we want to just translate that for he says how long are you too lazy how long are you dilatory how long are you gonna sit on the sidelines and not take the possession that god has given you and your fathers before you and that's the question that when we had a prophet come on the scene is the very question he was asking the people of god because we see if we go through a timeline of history we see that we had justification through luther we had sanctification through wesley and we had a restoration of the gifts at pentecost which was all great and none of those things regardless of what people in the message may say none of those things are done away with the gifts of god are still here in the church they may not be manifest the way they ought to but that's on us that's not on god because god's still the same and the man the sanctification still the same justification is just as powerful as it was then but the question is how long are we slack to go into the full inheritance that god has given to us see because it didn't stop see pentecost 1906 thought they had it they thought 1909 1906 i don't get the dates mixed up but we all know what we're talking about azusa street they had a restoration of the gifts of god and it looked as if that might have been the only thing they needed it seemed so powerful yet there was still a word to come behind that it threw a prophet to put them in their place how do we know because if we look at the scripture you can see the type that when the children of israel came up to cadence barney i'm kind of skipping now but when the children of israel came up to canes barnea and they sent spies to spy out the land i believe we could type that right with azusa street because see they brought forth a first fruits out of that land of promise they brought forth a power of the holy ghost they brought forth healings and to tongues interpretations and prophecies and miracles but there was something wrong they didn't want to go into the land they weren't willing to take the full word of god what the what the prophets before had said and go fully into that land because they said the people are too great so what happened they had to wander around if we could stay in a spiritual wilderness for another 40 years because it was until another 40 years after azusa street that a prophet came on the scene and was trying to tell the people it's time to possess the land that was given to you on that day of pentecost 40 years 1906 azusa street 40 years later 1946-47 all of a sudden faith of the substance starts getting recorded a prophet to come on the scene to tell the people that this isn't all there is how long are you slack to possess the land of your inheritance that's the question we had this morning where we have so many blessings and the power of god right here it's not just in the preacher it's not just in a prophet and lord forgive me i'm not trying to point people out but we know how people look at different ones in this message great ones and little ones and this and that but it's not just in brother donnie reagan it's not just it's not just in a brother any biscuit but it's in every single son and daughter of god for this hour because if it was if it was limited to just one person then the rapture would have already happened because we had a prophet come on the scene there'd be no need for you but the point is is that in each and every one of you there is a portion of god for this hour that has to be expressed it has to happen god won't leave one hoof behind and never has to be every single seed that was planted before the foundation of the world has to come to fruition some people bloom you ever notice that see everybody wants to be this great thing now and this great thing over here and this great thing then but if you know anything about gardening you understand we're in springtime right now all the flowers don't bloom at the same time what a mystery but the problem is our impatience we want so badly to to just blossom right off the bat but if we could go back in the scriptures and read when he brought them to the promised land he told them god didn't give them any illusions he said i'm not going to give you the land in one year he said you're going to have to fight you're gonna have to fight some battles that's why we're talking about the art of war this morning because this is a war nothing's gonna be easy for you i hate to break your bubble right now but you're a son and daughter of god in the most naked age that has ever been and will ever be if the odds were ten to one in jesus day they're a million to one in this day i think they said around the time of jesus when jesus came on the scene there might have been about a billion people on the earth i think that's what the statistics they kind of say that's right around where it was and then in just these last couple thousand years the populations you know exploded you know up to about seven and a half billion well we know according to scripture that there are more children of the bonds woman than children of the free so if we're expecting everybody to hear this message you got another thing coming because it can't happen do you realize how much of a miracle it is that you're here right now i stand in awe of god and the way he's kept me all the trials i've gone through all the trials you've gone through all the battles you faced all the family members that attacked you all the people at your job who hated you and yet by some miracle you're still right here just you sitting in that seat hearing the word of god having a hunger for this message proves it proves that there's something in you right now hallelujah don't let the devil steal that from you how many mistakes have you made yet there's still a little peace even though it may seem like it's just one of those you know you got that campfire that's just it looks like it's dead but you just let a little wind of the holy ghost you go up you ever camped before anybody ever camped you got one of those campfires you leave it all night all during the darkness it dies down the fires get cold the smoke starts to come out it's all smoky and dirty it smells bad it looks dead but you wake up and there's something you know that's still there because it's still smoking where there's smoke there's fire all you got to do is blow on it a little bit and all of a sudden you see those coals start to burn a little brighter so what do you do you don't just let it die you throw a little wood on the fire you throw a little kindling on the fire and when you blow on it some more and all of a sudden it comes back to life what is that that's your life you just let the wind of the holy ghost blow on you a little bit and you don't see if those clothes that you thought were dead will come back to life the problem is the holy ghost will come in this service right now it'll blow over your life it's blowing right now that holy ghost is here i don't care what you think i don't care what the devil's trying to tell you the holy ghost is here right now he's trying to speak by the blowing of the word that's why it's the foolishness of preaching it's all type god does these things just to prove he's god he could have chosen he could have chosen by reading just to get everything you need but he chose preaching why because with a preaching there's a there's a breath there's a power that comes out of that there's a force that comes out of that and you may think oh the holy ghost ain't working yeah it is right now because maybe you go out of this service just want maybe all of a sudden where you didn't have hope before now you just got a little bit of ember going all you got to do is keep blowing on it all you got to do is let the holy ghost blow upon those dead coals but what the problem is people of god is we don't feed that fire anymore that those clothes are burnt orange hot all day long you'll go out of the service saying i want to serve god more i feel like he spoke to me this morning i feel like i can do this now how many of you felt like that before you've been in a bad space in your life and all of a sudden the word comes forth and all of a sudden you had a hope that you didn't see we preach against hope a lot and i preached against it too but there's nothing wrong with it it's just we can't settle for that you see because hope will get you there hope will let you come out of the service going i believe i gotta hope i can do this i gotta hope that god's still faithful in my life but faith is the thing that will cause you to feed that fire see he said he said show me your faith without works i'll show you my faith by my works so you say oh i got faith but you're settling for hope you say you got faith but you're settling for that good fuzzy feeling you get in service there's nothing wrong with that that's god god's so simple he'll go right over top of you oh god is it feelings yeah but sometimes he'll because you may be so spiritually inept which we all are at times i'm pointing at myself sometimes he has to touch your emotions just to let you know he's there glory to god i hope you're getting it this morning we're talking about a warfare because as soon as you leave this place yeah you gotta hope hope is wonderful hope starts your journey hope gives you a thought that maybe just maybe there's still a chance for me but you show me your faith that that works i'll show you my faith by my works so then we got to move up brothers and sisters it's not just enough to hope you get that fuzzy feeling that's god i don't care oh i don't want to go just by emotions yeah like i said sometimes god because we're so blinded to the spirit and we have so little faith oh ye of little faith that sometimes you know when peter was sinking on the sea god could have just spoke the word and brought him up but he didn't have the faith to believe that so what did he have to do he had to physically reach down and pull him up and that's what god has to do to you sometimes sometimes you come into service feeling so downtrodden and so so upset and you just you feel like you threw away your last chance but then you leave out of the surface and it's completely unexplainable obviously you say god baby there's still hope for me what is that oh you say see the devil's right there to say oh but you can't go on feelings you know what the prophet said holy ghost without sensation blah blah all these different things which yes he said those things but he wasn't saying that to get rid of those things see we have preached just before but emotions are fine as long as they agree with the word we want to cast all those things out but god uses those things i don't know about you but there are many times i've witnessed the people and i just get happy while i'm witnessing and what does that do that makes me want to witness more sometimes god has to feed you those things to encourage you that doesn't mean they're evil now if your emotions disagree with the word you better watch out because the devil's gonna be right there oh those are just emotions you're just feeling good in your flesh but don't worry it'll go away if you were just feeling good in your flesh then you wouldn't have a desire to go repent for the things after the service you would have a desire to get closer to god because the flesh doesn't want that you that's a miracle you realize it's all a miracle if we could realize how much of a miracle all these things that our lives are your flesh hates god it just does sin is buried in the flesh it despises the very words of god and yet somehow when you're in the song service or when you're in the church service something so powerful on the inside of you overpowers all of that ungodly hatred and cause you to stand up and say amen that's not you that's not your flesh that's god almighty agreeing with his own word we heard the prophet saying it's just a miracle just you break all the laws of gravity just to raise your hand well that's a lot of work you just broke a lot of laws right there why'd you do it not because your flesh wanted to because something inside you pulled the strings brothers and sisters something inside you something keeps holding me hey man we got to understand that there's more to this inheritance than what we've been looking at see the pentecostals thought they had in azusa street but see they they proved that although they had the gifts the gifts were of god they were absolutely 100 of god well at least all the gifts that lined up with this the blood coming out of the hands and stuff obviously that's not in the word we can't trace that back we talk speaking in tongues the miracles the prophecies the healings all these powerful things visions and dreams and things coming forth those were all of god but because they could not just as the children of israel paul says because in hebrews because they couldn't mix the word with faith because they couldn't just believe that that inheritance over there was theirs they could never receive it it seems like such a simple thing but it's so hard for us because every day we're looking at a mirror and we see this old god forsaken flesh we see this old man that wants to drag you down to hell and you associate with him because you grew up with him all your life he tells you he is he's your best friend but then every time you turn your back he condemns you doesn't sound like much of a friend to me every time you turn your back he's lying cheating stealing watching pornography thinking lustful thoughts getting angry at his brother or sister doing this or that oh yeah he seems like a real good friend to me and then instead of instead of taking the blame on himself which is what the word tries to tell you is that all that blame goes back to that flesh he tries to blame you oh i'm not talking about your flesh i'm talking about that soul that lies inside of you that wants to do the will of god that desires all the good things of god and that flesh is right there oh why'd you do that he you didn't do it he did it you may have been with a weakness to let him overpower you but that's what we're talking about the art of warfare we got to learn how of our see we got so many weapons at our disposal there's an armory of weapons for the people of god if you only open the door and use them all you got to do is pick them up and you just got to believe that they work see see because that's right see god's always going to test you see god may come in your weakness you're having that bad time and he comes and he touches you he'll touch you and your soul and your emotions just to let you know he's there and that he still loves you but then you see what happens see god's got to test you too he's got to see if that hope can turn to faith so all of a sudden the next thing you know oh the fuzzy feeling's gone all of a sudden now the devil's trying to put anger in here in your life he's trying to put envy and strife and malice and all these other things maybe maybe all of a sudden right after you leave the service you got that fuzzy thing and say lord i could do this all of a sudden a a naked woman half naked women walks across there and all of a sudden your eyes wander for a little bit too long and now the devil's like see you didn't have nothing see the devil's gonna the devil's gonna try you and god with permission of god that god's gonna let the devil try you and he may take away all those good fuzzy emotions that you had but see that's where the faith of god comes in because when you can pass by those things and you can start taking the word of god for what it really is you realize those emotions if they agree with the word they're wonderful they help me to know that god's here but even if i don't feel him i know his words true i know this is simple but this is what we gotta have because if you can't believe who you are you can't receive your inheritance i tell you what i i have personal experience with this a little bit you know my mom passed away about two years ago come to mother's day and you think about a little bit you know but my mom left just a little bit of inheritance nothing much you know she never had much but we had a little something so when it came time to go to the bank or wherever it was to sign up for this inheritance i didn't walk in there and all of a sudden i had to go sign my name to prove who i was and to receive what was mine by law by right i didn't wonder do i is this mine no why because i believed what was written on the inherit on the will on the testament on the documents they proved that i was a receiver of that inheritance and if we can see that this right here is our new testament through the blood of jesus christ who wrote down your name on this book and told you you are a receiver and it's your inheritance to have all you got to do you don't sign your name anymore you sign his name because oh the family of heaven and earth is named after him if you try to sign your own name you're gonna be disappointed every time because there's only one name that can unlock that inheritance and that is the lord jesus christ amen i hope we understand this this morning see this inheritance is so much greater than the devil's allowed you to believe this inheritance oh my goodness you see because in the natural it looks like you have no right to it it looks you have no right to it but there is something in the seed of god that won't stop until their name jesus christ is on that line and sign on the dotted line it can't stop look at jacob look at jacob jacob had no right naturally to esau's inheritance no right to it he had though he stole it and it was his he still had no technical legal right to it he gave it to him it was his he allowed it to pass but when that angel came what gave jacob the right to wrestle with god oh well well now you know he was the seed of god well we know that now but look at his situation he had to look at his life and he saw he was a shyster he saw he was a liar he betrayed his brother he betrayed his wives he put his wives out there in front of him and tried to let them take the bread of the blow what gave him the right but there was something in him that's in every child of god that the world the people of the church might look at you like you got no right to this inheritance but there's still something in you that holds to the heel of god and says i won't let you go till you bless me hallelujah and look what happened what did that angel say he said it's almost daybreak where are we at it's almost the breaking of the day it's almost the breaking of the day all you gotta do is hold on to that angel you that devil's like you have no right you stole you cheated you lie you say i don't care i gotta have it i can't go on without it i gotta cross the river i gotta meet my denominational brother up there someday there's gotta be a shout out someday but i gotta have something to prove who i am amen glory to god it's almost the breaking of the day three minutes to midnight what is it now that was years ago what is it now it's almost the breaking of the day now it's not the time to stop wrestling with that angel you want your inheritance you better fight for it you better you know i'm gonna say it anyway you better lie cheat steal to get it oh that's harsh brother that's what jacob did i'm not talking about running out lying to people cheating and stealing it's a figure of speech you do every thing in your power you know what if the lord puts it on your heart you gotta quit your job and get before this altar for three weeks straight to get that holy ghost you do whatever it takes you'd look at that angel dead in the face you say i'm not letting you go till you bless me he says it's going to cost you everything you have i don't care you're going to look like an idiot i don't care you're going to look like a fool people are going to hate you i don't care the only thing i know is that there's one man that i don't want to hate me and that's jesus christ i don't want him to hate me i want him i want to come to him in peace with that token before me let's just make that our first stop on this on this art of warfare we want to talk about the weapons we have at our disposal your birthright your first weapon that's the very first thing you got to have why everything hinges upon it everything i was telling this story and it's so powerful you read that you actually read that whole book on the the pilgrims progress and you see when he received his journey he received a sacred scroll that he kept his bosom and one time he fell asleep and he loses this scroll in a place and he realized that without this scroll i'm lost oh it's so powerful when you see the people of god all through the ages whether they realized it or not they were preaching that token because he said surely if i'm to enter in at the gates of that celestial city i've got to have that scroll that proves i was set on this course by god almighty you got to have it you got to have that token it's the only thing that's going to get you through it's the only thing that proves your right to that inheritance it's on that very thing if we could say it's on that scroll that token where god by the blood of jesus christ wipe your sins off he wiped your name off the ledger and he signed his own name in your place and by doing that what did he do he signed over his inheritance to you how many of you would be willing to do that got someone you don't even like let alone could barely love done all manner of evil towards you hurts you and yet you're willing at the end of the road to sign over everything you had to them oh my that's what god did for you i'm talking about inheritance i'm talking about the art of war see there's there's a warfare going on right now you're either believing god or you're believing the devil there there's no in between here brothers and sisters you're either believing god or you're believing the devil and you've got to have that token to make it that's your war orders from headquarters if we could say those are your written instructions without that matthew 28 19 cannot be of real effect to you mark 16 cannot be real effect to you because upon that token upon that scroll the orders from god maintains those orders go ye into all the world and preach the gospel cast out demons heal the sick lay your hands on the sick they shall recover all of those orders are laying in that token why you say brother how do we know that because we can see the sons of skeva they wanted to be in that army but they didn't receive their orders yet they didn't receive their token yet so they go out there presuming in the name of jesus christ who paul preached oh yeah they were trying to fly the banners of the of the army of jesus christ but they see the enemy knows better the enemy's got his spies all over the place too he knew exactly who they were he said wait a second now you know you know what gave the devil the right to beat up his own people because they were deserters from his army they were deserters from his army but they hadn't officially come over to christ's army yet you know what they do to deserters they usually they get rid of them putting it putting it nicely hey man i always feel good this morning i feel pretty good i'm just grateful to god this morning those sons of skiva they act in all boldness they say we've seen the way these people have fought we've seen the weapons of their warfare let's try using it ourselves so let's say in the name of jesus christ whom paul preached paul i know jesus christ i know but who are you he's like you're in our ranks what are you doing you're part of my army what do you think it's like beats him up and sends it back to his master he says like they say in the army you got to go to the brig time to go to a little a little a little punishment for you but what was it they didn't possess that token that they had to have they didn't possess the orders from god that gave them the authority to do what they were trying to do and that's what so many people try to do they want to do this and they want to do that but you got to get the orders from god first to run around and you're shooting blindly you're going to hurt yourself you're going to hurt if you send a man into the military there's a reason they got basic training because if they go in there they're going to go they're going to get their rifle against the m16 start shooting up everybody else they won't know how to distinguish the tactics you know we find if you find the natural military all the time they have what they call friendly fire there's a famous they talk about all the time i've heard there's a famous nfl player named pat tillman who they said was killed by friendly fire because they were all new guys in the military and this guy didn't realize that the people that were right across from a couple hundred yards were his own people and all of a sudden they could start getting shot at what happens confusion now the sudden you're just shooting everywhere you can you're just trying to save your own skin not knowing that you're blasting your own people at the same time what is it they got to have a token you got to have a training the only the only thing that can do that for you is the holy ghost because when the spiritual bullets start to fly you better know who your headmaster is who your general is where the goal is at there's no retreat in god this army you can't tuck tail and run you may get wounded god will bind you up and heal the brokenhearted he'll close all those wounds that you've had you may get hurt you make it you may get ashamed of yourself but god's got encouragement there for you if you can believe it amen let's just talk about another one we talk about praise praise is a powerful weapon in the armory of the believer oh my let's just talk about it for a little bit see praise is one of the first things satan tries to take that weapon from you right away because praise brings god on the scene you see our general in this war he likes praises he likes praises that's why those godly men back in the days of the the revolutionary war that's why they had the little drummers in the band going before him because they knew that there was something in that craze there was something in that music that could get the people to believe they could get to people to push forward towards the enemy you know they said if they get the they get that they get that little drummer guy if he got shot it could it could put the whole army in a disarray because that drummer that that music we're talking natural but think spiritually people that drummer that music kept the people in a beat it kept them all one they heard and what it would do it would get their mind off of all the worldly things that were besetting them at the time maybe just the other day they had a friend get killed in the battle but that music would get them in a state of mind they'll think about the cause they were fighting for no doubt when those when those revolutionary war soldiers heard that first song that star-spangled banner he said oh proudly the they waved over there over the battlefield even though the battle looked lost those people could look up and take courage and that's what praise does for the believer it raises your head up out of the mucking mire praise get you out of your mental faculties and bring you into the presence of god god loves praises look at look at the battle of jericho let's just give you a couple examples the battle of jericho they marched around that city all those days complete dead silence everybody looked at them like they were insane you'd look insane too they didn't care what they had the first thing that we just talked about they had their orders they had that token they had orders say go around that city and do what i told you to do so what did they do they followed those orders it was a simple thing in our eyes but how many of you could keep your mouth shut for six six seven or eight days you know i've heard of people they take what they call a vow of silence i don't think i've ever lasted a second if i would have been able to try to do that but that's what they did why because they had the orders but then when the order came you see this is what this is what the people don't understand see jericho was a powerful stronghold you know we've heard all the stories you know they said they had chariot races on the wall so thick it looks so bad for the children of israel these people didn't have anything they were wandering around with their little sacks and their sandals and their manna and carrying around this work of the covenant this golden box to the people that look so stupid only rahab believed the report when she heard about what god had done for them throughout the other cities but there was something in them that knew all they had to do was follow those orders they received that's all you got to do this morning you know it's so simple if you could believe it believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if you could just go there all of a sudden what happens god tells them when i let you know you blew the trumpets you shout with the top of your life and the walls would come crashing down what was that that's just the praise of the people of god getting out of shot it wasn't the voices that brought down the wall i'm sure sometimes it may and now maybe the lord could have used it i'm you know scientists are always trying to do those things trying to figure it out they say all the way oh they shouted from these four directions might have caused a resonant cascade in the air and frequencies bouncing upon frequencies would have caused the vibration who knows i don't care how that happened all i know is it did happen and it was all due to the praises of god going up from the people of god look at paul and silas people paul and silas beaten and thrown in prison satan does that to you all the time you try to witness in the name of jesus christ he put you in a prison in your mind just when you were on a high you were witnessing you're trying to win souls for god see i'm trying to bring this down to rubber meets the road stuff if you try to live so high above and try to live in this like spiritual plane where you know you don't have no idea what's going on we're talking about real life i'm trying to talk about real experiences here i'm gonna i'm gonna give you experiences of my own not just specific but i'll just tell you what i've been through how many of you ever struggled with something let's just raise our hand how you ever had a battle that you had to fight you struggled with a besetting sin or something else the devil's put in your path all of a sudden you say lord i'm done with this thing so what do you do you're by the grace of god you focus you say lord i'm gonna pray i'm just gonna trust you and he gives you deliverance from it and what happens a lot of times you don't even realize it because it goes away so quietly that devil doesn't want you to know that you just got delivered so he just slinks away really quietly a lot of times see we all want these big like hallelujah things but a lot of times god just says go like brother troy priest she said all he has to do is say go and they go all he has to do is say come and you come sometimes it's just that simple it's not you know every time now this happens sometimes do you get deliverance and you might get slain in the spirit might dance in the spirit who knows but sometimes it could just be simple as that way it's gone you didn't even know what happened but what happens is sometimes because we're not spiritually minded enough oh and i'm speaking from my experience because i've been here right i'm going to tell you exactly what's happened to me i've been going through something fighting something all my life or who knows what it was it's been multiple different things all of a sudden it comes to your mind i haven't fought that in a long time see you're so you're so busy with other things all of a sudden you don't even realize that it strikes you that enemy amen man i haven't fought with that lion spirit in a long time you know what happens right there the lion spirit says my turn to come right back because i'm telling you brothers and sisters if you don't realize that right away and you don't real and you don't give god praise you don't fortify yourself against the enemy that devil's going to come right back because i can i could it'd be countless to tell you how many times that the lord's given me deliverance for something all of a sudden i look back and say wow i haven't fought that spirit in a long time a day later lord why am i struggling with this spirit again am i the only one see what is it because you got to fortify yourselves with that praise you got to give praise you got to build up those spiritual walls those godly walls of praise and glory giving to god so that and let the holy ghost come and fill that spot so the devil can't come in there and take it over again see and that's what the devil does he tries to blind you to all the successes that you've had or should i say god's head through you we know what we're talking about and what does he do oh he comes right back he's going to go see satan satan doesn't have any new tricks he knows what you're weak on he knows what you struggle with and he's going to constantly hit you there until you guard that spot because he's got nothing else yeah he might hit you over here for a second but the lord will give you deliverance and that may not be a particular weak spot for you so you just you go on not even worried about it you know i had a i used to wear shorts you know i mean most people did when they were worldly or whatever did whatever i used to wear shorts you know go to church you know after school played soccer practice going to my soccer shorts and whatever go to church you know when i had to give that up i didn't struggle some people might that's that's the battles that we all fight amen i'm not trying to make anyone feel bad for that or whatever because it could be it could be a big thing it could be a little thing but for you it might be even though it might be so i'm just i'm just saying this i'm not trying to preach it nobody i don't know nothing but if it's speaking to you you better know this is god because i'm just talking about the short thing for a random thing but maybe you struggle with that and to you that's a really big thing because every time you put those things on the devil's right there to condemn you but for some reason you just can't get over yourself to get away from it so to you that's a big thing but you got to realize that the weapons of our warfare aren't carnal you know until god gets that out of you you got to keep praying you got to keep pushing you better keep praising like we said paul and silas paul and silas one we're preaching the word of god when it sold to christ and the devil didn't like it so they come and beat them throw them in prison let's turn there to act 16. let's turn there we sing we sing that song you know paul in silence praying that night amen realize these are we're talking about the weapons for warfare for you these are things that you gotta have these are weapons at your disposal these are things that you can use you don't have if you have the holy ghost in you you don't have to ask permission to pick up these weapons and go to fight the devil and every weapon has a different situation amen we go to acts 16. sorry i'm trying to get there but it's kind of hard sometimes you get sweaty and pages start sticking together praise god anyhow acts chapter 16 verse 25 it says at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them see that's the thing too many times we don't want anybody to hear us praise god praise god at work praise god in your home when things go bad praise god when things go right praise god when things are just indifferent praise god but as the scripture says praise ye the lord everything that have pressed praise the lord yay dead praise god amen you say oh everything that had breath praise the lord that's why the trees got to praise god the trees breathe too so they praise god all the animals praise god you've got to praise god and look what happens the prisoners heard them it wasn't just a little praise god no they were putting it right in the face of the devil they were just gonna pick up that weapon and just oh praise god i can do this or i can no they went to battling with that weapon you want to know that's one of the greatest weapons you got is praise when when job was on that ass sheep that was one of his greatest weapons he said though he slayed me yet i trust him that was a praise from the bottom of his heart and so paul and silas had the same spirit in them though he slay me i'll trust him and the prisoners heard that it says and suddenly see this is what awesome about these weapons brothers and sisters this weapon of praise especially it brings our commander down on the scene because he dwells in the praises of his people and when the lord of hosts comes on the battlefield there's nothing that can stand before him but so many times we weren't willing to tell people see i we we're not willing to tell people our problems we're prideful we're worried why because because we're worried people ain't got enough love and a lot of people don't have enough love we're not willing to go to a brother or sister say brother pray for me i'm using some of these things because these are the things most people are really ashamed of brother pray for me i i really struggle with lust brother pray for me i you know i lie all the time you know maybe not even big lies but every time i get into a situation a really pinched situation i i just gotta get out of it i can't take the heat i'm not willing to take the blame or take the responsibility so i just i you know it's not big lies but i just i weasel my way out of it come on we've all been there everybody wants to act holier than now but we're human we got problems and if you could know who you are in the flesh you realize that that shouldn't be a hard thing oh brother that can't be right he says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another not judge one another not poke at one another and every time you see that person oh say brother you've been telling lies lately no dear brother i'm praying for you brother see and if you could get to that point like we spoke earlier about that we're in shorts thing that little example maybe it's not short for maybe it's that lion thing it's a little bit of lust see and what we do is instead of completely conquering that demon we let them squat on our land what do we do we make deals with them we make pacts with them just like joshua did he made a pact with them he said okay we won't attack you we'll just leave you alone that wasn't right that's what we do though isn't it oh oh you you're struggling with that lust i'm hitting that last spirit for a reason i don't know why i'm just going there because that's that's our age today that was the original sin and it's right back in the end too so hey if you're a red-blooded male that's something that the devil is going to try to hit you with you got all the hormones in your food messing your chemistries up you got you got every airwave of television even though you may not have a tv all those airwaves are trying to about like hit your mind all those things going through i'm just hitting that thing so you say oh well man i struggle with lust so bad i can't every time i see a woman you got the rubber neck brother brother branham struggled with it too he said he had to put that cross in his windshield so he could remind himself of jesus christ when he see those half-naked women but my wife and i were just in the in the mall yesterday and we went to the store to see if they could maybe find a skirt or something you know every once if it seems like it's coming back in style now amazingly enough amazing how the devil will try to copycat i ain't seen so many skirts in all my life now praise god for that i'd rather have it that than many skirts at least most of them are long but we going to the store and i made a comment to my wife i said i said i'm not a betting man but i said you know they got these bets they call over under you know like they have a game or something they say you get a bet it's going to be over 100 points scorer under 100 points scored i said over under 50 she's like what are you talking about i said over under 50 how much skin is showing in this place over 50 or under 50 percent because they're all running around half naked and if you're not careful you're going to get hit but what happens is here's what the devil does he's so sneaky i'm trying to tell you some tactics to the devil you know i i got that idea of to preach this message the art of war off of a man named sun tzu a really famous asian uh eastern kind of a philosopher his name was sun tzu he was a he was like asian and asian military genius and he wrote the book it was called the art of war and he said something you know he said he said the enemy of my enemy is my friend and so what happens is the devil may not even have people that are his friends but because they don't like you he'll grab them right into the fold so what do they do so here's what the devil does these are his tactics because we got to understand the tactics of the devil see we our prophet said that if you could wreck it one of the true deliverances is when you can recognize the devil and all of his tricks because this is what he's doing to a lot of people in this church i believe everywhere that's not just trying to poke at people this is i'm preaching to myself here too but here's what he does i'm just giving you a lust spirit example because it's so prevalent but say just say it's so it's so easy to access so maybe you used to have a problem with pornography and you used to you just couldn't get away from me used to do it this and that whatever now all of a sudden the lord seems to get you delivered from that you're not really struggling with that but every time you go out you just seem to rubber neck and all those women walking around and and what what does the devil do he says well he said well he gets you to reason well i'm not watching pornography and i'm really trying not to look at these women but you know it's better than looking at pornography right that seems reasonable and and so you convince yourself you're right you know you oh you know well at least i'm not looking at pornography you don't realize that that is pornography but but we're getting you know we're talking apples and apples here but that's what the devil does now what is that that's that's making a pact with that enemy in your land you without even realizing it you did just what joshua did when they came to him all sneakily and beggars closed instead come from a far off land he found out they're their next door neighbors and that's what we do it could be that lion spirit you say well i don't lie these big lies i just tell the little ones to get out of trouble every once in a while and you just make the pact with that enemy not realizing they're just cousins they're they're two sides of the same coin it's the same spirit what we got to stop doing is making pacts with the enemy and the only reason you make a pact with the enemy like that is because we haven't received faith to believe that you can have a total deliverance from every act of the devil but it's there for you to have if you use these weapons use that praise you know what you say praise god though these people are walking around half naked everywhere god's given me eyes to see that that's wrong you know what even if you may struggle with it praise god for the little bit you got you say oh i i got away from the pornography but i can't help but stare at those i just i don't know why i'm hitting it maybe he's hitting someone here this morning i trust it is maybe you can't get away from looking at those women but you know what don't give the devil glory don't don't every time that happened oh is me i did this and that say praise god at least i got a little something here you got you gave me deliverance from that pornography you gave me deliverance from that cheating spirit you gave me deliverance from that hatred or that anger you could give me deliverance from all those little things too hallelujah he can do it he's here to do it it's not a question of if he can do it it's when will you accept it you got to be patient brothers and sisters you got to be patient you got to press towards the mark of the calling he said let's turn let's turn after turn to first second timothy second timothy chapter two we're not gonna keep you much longer i hope this is a blessing to you see we gotta understand you got weapons at your disposal you got that token that's your main weapon right there that without that token that we spoke of the very first thing you well you don't have access to these other ones but if you can grab that token you have full access that's your that's your that's your universal key to unlock all these other weapons that you have against the enemy second timothy chapter two amen i'm just praising god this morning because i know where he's brought me from i can't deny where he's brought me from i may not be happy about the things that i went through or suffered or whatever but you know what i'm still here he tried to chase me off that devil tried to chase me off but i'm still standing i may not be i'm not standing by my own merits but god let me stand here if you could come to that place there's nothing you can stop do you need to stop you though a righteous man falls seven times he gets back up i don't care i don't care what it looks like i'm gonna have a quote here i'll read in a minute but let's let's get to second timothy two chapter verse one through four there thou therefore my son be strong who was this strong in the grace that is in christ jesus oh my god be strong in his grace though you fall though you struggled maybe there were times where you refused that holy ghost because you didn't understand it you were scared but there's still something pulling you be strong in the grace of god because his grace is strong oh my god he says and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that loreth entanglet himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be a soldier amen that's where we go back to what we talked about in the beginning what's your goal here is your goal to be some big thing is your goal just to be liked because i tell you what if your goal is to be liked you're in the wrong message because 90 of the people you meet are probably more 99.9 well we'll just say 90. because i've met a lot of people who may not want anything to do with god but won't really come against me because they're just ignorant which is praise god for that because you know what at least they're neutral about it then you meet the ones that just want to rip your head off i've been there i'm a witness brothers and sisters when i came into this message we had every church in the area after us we had a council of churches meeting come after us we had like five or six churches i was there i'm a witness those people stood up and denied the word of god right before their face tried to tell them about a baptism just something simple you don't even need a revelation to see it if you got if you have any comprehension of plain english you can understand that and yet they stood right there and literally told us and on the quoting verbatim they said thus say there's a woman stood up said thus saith the lord this is a cult their church is almost dead people literally people literally dying from their church over the last few years their church grew really large and then all of a sudden her the husband the pastor got parkinson's disease i'm not saying these things to condemn anybody i believe there's still hope for anybody i really believe that trusting they didn't blaspheme the holy ghost but you know i'm believing i i believe that because i don't i don't hate anybody i don't want to see anybody fail the grace of god i don't want to see anybody not make it but you better be careful you better watch it but i'm a witness brothers and sisters that you got to endure hardness because your family members will come against you it's going to happen you know but if you have patience brother isaac if you have patience your wife will come it's just a matter of time i'm a witness brothers and sisters i'm a witness of it i'm watching people my sister came and heard me preach for the first well technically the second time my mother's funeral but for a real church service got to hear how i got to hear it by the grace not me but god preached came and heard the word of god for the first time last week been waiting for years but there's something on her now god said to put her in a bad situation but god's pulling her god's drawing her i've watched friends of mine brother cam and brother jesse they're brothers coming into this message why patience brothers gonna happen it's got you you're a son of god you spoke the word it can't come back void you're not gonna leave one hoof behind brother marshall brother connolly it's not gonna it can't be stopped because the weapons of your wire fire are not carnal but they're mighty to the pulling down of strongholds sometimes you gotta dig a long time sometimes you gotta fight a long time but you keep pushing through it's got to happen 400 years they waited in egypt but it had to happen the word came forth and it had to happen it didn't have a choice pharaoh didn't have a choice moses didn't have a choice israel didn't have a choice they were getting delivered whether most of them wanted it or not and most of them didn't because they died that's the way it is right now god's going to deliver people why do you think in in the prophet's time there came so many people to him that got delivered but never really served the god serve god because god said i don't care my words powerful i'm going to show that i'm alive i'm going to prove to the world who i am so there will be no excuses and there will be no excuses glory to god praise praise is just another one of them we could go we could literally go forever on this topic but let's just go another one let's talk about godly wisdom that's another weapon that we have i'm talking about natural wisdom i'm talking godly wisdom well the kind that god could only give as he spoke in the word in that hour where it comes from a place you don't know where it came from all you know is you spoke the words and it happened all you know is you spoke the words and it touched somebody's heart that's godly wisdom we're not going to go there but if you read in the book of acts when paul preached to the greeks there you'll notice you can find it in a lot of commentaries because it's a powerful point but you find that when stephen preached to the jews that were there jerusalem when he was stoned he used scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture why because they were scriptural people so he knew where he could hit him at that's what god wanted he used scripture after scripture but when paul preached to the gentiles the first time he preached his large message to the idol worshipers and he said you have the tomb of the unknown god he says him i'm going to declare to you right now but what did he do he didn't use any scriptures why that was a godly wisdom coming forth it was a way like you say brother how does that work well let's think about in in brother branham's time when he spoke to that infidel about that apple tree that was a godly wisdom sometimes you may speak about something you don't even know what you're talking about brother branham just starts talking about he just said he sat there eating his little apple that man didn't have any idea he said he was an infidel all of a sudden they start talking about apple trees and god gives him a gives him a word he says where does that life go he says it goes down in the roots he said what causes that he said there's got to be some intelligence he said i don't know he says i know who that intelligence is see what is that that's a godly wisdom that's that's a powerful weapon of god that he can use you for he can do it he can use you for all these things all these weapons are available to you let's go on to another one real quickly and then we'll close we want to talk about prayer prayer a powerful weapon amen we all know these things these are simple things but so many times the devil blinds us in the heat of the battle we don't know what we got what we're packing we don't know the weapons in the armory of god right there for you to take prayer let's let's just talk about it we got let's go to psalms 18. psalms 18 we're going to do a few scriptures we're not going to hold you much longer we want to talk about we want to encourage you this morning this is about making a rapture people this is about possessing an inheritance this is about coming to a place of perfection in jesus christ this is about believing god and stop trusting in your own abilities stop thinking that you can somehow do this yourself but you can't but you got to realize that when god gives you something you can take it you have every right to it if you could just believe enough to take it you may not see results brother isaac have you seen all the results yet but you still believe brother connolly you got children that are out there but you still believe you may not see the results and look what it's already produced it comes to pass people i'm a witness you're witnesses that it's still true all you got to do is hold on to those promises these are simple things we're talking about but brother we're at the finish line right now for you to give up right now would be one of the great most grievous things you could possibly do because all he that endureth to the end you may be hanging on by the skin of your teeth you may be hanging on by your pinky finger now but you're hanging on and you'll find at the end of the road that the whole time he's hanging on to you and he's not gonna let you go amen psalms 18. praise god i know i get excited but you know what god's good to me i don't know about you you know what i look at my life i know what i've been through i know the times i've backslid every day of my life i know the things i've struggled with i know the times i felt anger in my heart and didn't want to i know the times where i got angry at brothers and sisters or friends or loved ones and didn't want to i know the times i lied cheated stealed stole done whatever else you could do but you know what somehow i'm still here i don't say somehow we know why how it's because god's grace and i can say the same for you right now the weapons of your warfare have kept you there's something an anchor in your soul you can't explain sister angie you've gone through so many battles but you're still standing brother marshall you struggled maybe with different things but you're still here there's something in all of you still holding onto a promise and no matter what the devil says i don't care what the devil's trying to tell you right now when i see that i see a seat of abraham because only the seed of abraham can hold to the promise no matter what the circumstances judas had he could have gone to pentecost i tell you what look at the grace god's head on you god offers this inheritance to the children of the devil first and they always turn it down every single time cain could have ruled over abel do as your brother you'll be accepted you can i'm paraphrasing but you know all these things do as your brother do his sacrifice you'll be accepted and you'll rule what did he do he couldn't do it saul not that he was a seat of the devil but to just just to prove that man's choice is wrong god gives it all to saul he throws it all away because he just wouldn't listen to god he wouldn't follow god now then we see judas could have gone up to pentecost there was nothing stopping him physically but spiritually there was nothing to hold him and yet peter who looked 10 times worse goes right up and gets what he needs something still holding you amen psalms 18 he says i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress my deliverer my god my strength and whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies oh my said the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of hell compass me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord i cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears isn't that what you feel like you go to work you're surrounded you're compassed about by the snares of ungodly men everywhere you look it's evil he said i cried out to the lord and my cry came into his ears he said then the earth shook and trembled whoo now the lord of hosts is coming on the scene you want to call down the commander of this army he says the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was rough he wasn't mad with you he wasn't mad with david he was mad at the enemies that's what the devil does god comes on the scene angry may come in a service just like this hitting things pretty hard you were crying out for deliverance god's come right now and the devil will make you think always come with a roaring he's come with an earthquake he's come with a trembling but he didn't come to attack you he came for your enemies and if you could separate yourself from your enemy right now which is your flesh you'd see that that thundering and lightning that power out of his nostrils he's coming forth with that earthquake came not to destroy you but to destroy your enemy amen he was rough he was angry verse 8 there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it oh watch this he bowed the heavens also and he came down oh my and darkness was under his feet he rode upon a cherub and did fly yeah he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret places pavilion round about him where dark waters and thick clouds of the skies at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hailstones and coals of fire oh my god the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice that's what he's doing right now there's the almighty god giving his voice right now not to not to condemn you but he's coming for your enemy you better know who you are if you're not if you're not if you don't know you'll think he's coming to attack you but it's your enemy he's coming after you prayed for deliverance he's here to get it he said at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed his hailstones it calls of fire oh my the highest and the highest gave his voice hailstones and coals of fire yet he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomforted them then the channels of water were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breast of thy nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of the waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me and that's the other that's the last one we're going to talk about today the last part the last weapon we have it seems so weird to the people that don't know god but our last weapon we have is weakness oh you say brother how can weakness be a weapon oh it's a weapon all right oh my because when you're weak he's strong when you're sorrowful he's there to give you joy when you're in trouble he's there to get you out if you could just see your own weakness trying to claw out of it by your own strength oh my he said they were two said my enemies were too strong for me he said they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay oh my he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered oh my god he delivered me because he delighted in me he delivers you because he delights in his people he loves you he wants to deliver you he wants to brood over you right now he's right here to do that amen oh my god he said he delivered me because he delighted in me the lord recorded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands as he recompensed me for i has kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his statutes from me i was also a right before him and i kept myself from mine iniquity therefore had the lord recompense me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight with the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful with an upright man that will show thyself upright with the pure that will show thyself pure and with the fur word that will show thyself forward for thou will save the afflicted people but will bring down high looks oh my listen to how much power is in that weakness the afflicted you may be down but realize that god many times bring those things just to show you that without him you can do nothing that's why he when those when the when the disciples were on the sea and the winds and the waves were going to overflow them and they say master care is not that we perish see they recognize their weakness and then all he asked was oh ye of little faith why did you doubt why did you not realize that my perfect weakness in you allows me to show my perfect strength and he rebukes the wind and the waves it's that simple this morning he could do that right now for you hey man i'm going to read this one quote and then we'll have you dismiss i want to give you all an encouragement i heard this quote and i tell you what brother i about shouted i about shout i tell you i i did in my spirit i did my cards my my wife was sitting next to me but didn't want to blow your eardrums out but i want you to listen to this if there's any of you who don't think god loves you or that think you can't receive the holy ghost because you've gone too far i want you to listen to this this is from conferences 1960. he says there might be some who say well look here brother branham i'm an old man i'm an old woman i'm insignificant i was born in a home that didn't even believe in god listen to this he says i don't care how insignificant it may be how little you may be how old you may be how simple you may be listen to this how many times you've tried to receive the holy spirit how many triads you've tried how many times you tried to repent how many times you've tried to do right and failed he said there's still hope for you as long as god's knocking at your door i don't care how many churches you joined how many mistakes and how much fanaticism or how much this to you or that you've done there's still hope as long as god knocks at your door and i want to tell everybody that this morning i don't care how many times you thought god's passed you over or you thought you failed the grace of god if there's still something in your heart pulling for god there's still hope for you god's still here for you amen let's stand there's still hope for you it's a warfare but the weapons of our warfare aren't carnal we're not worried about these carnal things that we see every day sure we don't like many of the things that happen but i tell you what if jacob based all his life off of the carnal things he would have never gotten his birthright if he would have based everything off his carnal he wouldn't even try to wrestle that angel because he said well i'm just a i have no right to anything anyhow if they believed in just their carnal ruth would have never gotten what she had she had no right in the natural nothing she was she was a born illegitimate of incest a moabite she had no right to the things of god but when god gives you that inheritance see let's go let's go let's just do a little real skit forward real quick real quick as we close we go to revelation and all of a sudden there came an angel down with his feet on the land and on the sea and the scripture says there was a little book open in his hand that was your inheritance right there but i want you to see something it's not see everybody wants to cry and cry and oh lord please give it to me oh lord please give it to me it's yours see see he didn't tell john go ask for the book he said go take it and when he came up to the angel he didn't say oh please can i please have the book he said give me the little book that's a powerful statement just a second ago he was crying who's worthy to take the book nobody's worthy to take the book and now all of a sudden a little bit later he goes up to the angel himself and says give me the book hallelujah that's you right now you need something from god it's yours ruth didn't ask boaz for anything she said she didn't say oh boaz please spread your scooter for me please redeem me she said redeem me she said spread therefore thy skirt over thee over me because you're a near kinsman she knew who she was she knew what her rights were and if you know that you're a son and daughter of god you could go to god and say lord this is my right you died to give me this inheritance you signed my name on the line jesus christ with yours it's mine that's the problem too many times we make ourselves unworthy you are unworthy but it's still you're right anyhow jacob wasn't worthy it was his ruth wasn't worthy it was still his judah and tamar timar didn't have a right to do what she did but when she did what she did and and lay with him as a prostitute and receive that child he promised what did he say he didn't he didn't say you're a wicked woman he said you're more righteous than i am because you did everything it took to get that promise that i gave you that's what god's looking right now amen you can do it because it's not you doing it the promise has already been made the works you do are nothing right now it's between you and god the works come after you want to work for god get the holy ghost then you'll work for god because he'll work through you amen but so many times we put the cart before the horse we're hoping lord if i if i preach this much if i witness this much if i pray this much if i read this much if i listen to this many messages lord i'll get enough in me enough word in me to get the holy ghost if there's not enough word in you to get the holy ghost when you ask you believe and repent that there never will be you see that i'm not trying to condemn anybody see the devil trying to say well maybe i don't have it then that's not the point the point is that seed that god put in you from the beginning is enough it's not until after the holy ghost comes and quickens it that it can mature and bring forth fruit anyway we're all trying to bring forth fruits without even having the life yet and i believe a lot of people here have the holy ghost but just haven't you like we spoke at the beginning there's just those embers that are that are just seeming to die but all you got to do is let the holy ghost blow out once more let the holy ghost just come and blow over those coals of your dead life let the holy ghost start to start to burn a little hotter in you all of a sudden you feel the love of god a little bit brighter in your soul but don't let it stop there don't just settle for that now you feed that fire you feed it what do you feed it with you feed it with the worm you feed feet if you throw you throw the logs on the fire every day every day you wake up you throw a little flog on the fire and then what do you do you go back you let the wind blow up some more it doesn't stop there you just keep feeding it and feeding it and feeding it pretty soon that thing will become a wildfire in your soul it'll burn out every devil you know i was telling this will be my last little thing and we'll say prayer if you have need of prayer we pray for you god's here i don't care what anybody thinks remember we're not talking about emotions emotions are good but emotions aren't everything it's got to be both emotions we want emotions anything without emotions is dead but see many times in that moment of trial that devil will let your emotions try to trick you because god wants to see if you've got the faith to push through that many times you might get into prayer and it may seem deader than the doornail but see god wants to see are you going to press through that and all of a sudden you find yourself weeping before the face of god why well it's not it's not about just those things it's about it's about it's about a love of christ in your hearts but this one thing that got me thinking one time was about you know we heard about those sun worshipers they have that are out there in different parts of the world that worship the sun and i almost envy those people you know because they're so dedicated to their god this is a little thing that lord jobs in my heart i hope it a blessing to you just as we close all right i say many of those people they worship the sun they stare at the sun with eyes wide open so much so to their eyes just gloss over and they're blinded i wonder so many times i wonder if that's got what god really wants from us if we could just stare into the son of god just long enough just stare to his word staring to his face look at him all of a sudden you'll be blinded to all the things of the world all of a sudden your eyes will gloss over with the glory of god and you're not going to see the things of the world anymore we're not talking about a natural son brothers and sisters we're talking about staring into the sun the s-o-n of god looking to him who is the author and finisher of our faith let his glory shine upon you look at him and all of a sudden you'll find that all the other things will just fade away from view you won't see those those women anymore you won't see the strife at your work all of a sudden things will just be glory you're not that you're going to not fight battles but god can give you such grace you could just fly right over all the top of those things because all of a sudden you're in heavy places amen even though paul and silas they were in that prison they were in heavenly places they were in a place those jailers they didn't know anything of but the one jailer wanted to know when it was all said and done he said he said don't kill yourself he said you can receive this just as much as we have oh my god that's so powerful we're talking about warfare know what you have at your disposal amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer lord jesus we're just so grateful to you this morning father we love you lord we love your word we love your ways father we love your people we love the way you move in our lives oh god lord we're trusting you lord god every single day that we wake up we trust you and i pray that these words that have been spoken here this little jumbled up message that we tried to put forth lord god by your grace that you spoken lord would go to the hearts of the people oh god that you just magnify your name through this bride of jesus christ in this hour may you give us the strength to see oh god that it's not our strength that prevails lord god but it's it's our weakness lord our our weakness in ourselves in our accepting oh god that you're strong enough to deliver lord we not we don't want to be as israel did and limit the holy one of israel but we want to give you lord all the preeminence in our lives to do whatever you would have us to do help us to know oh god that there's still hope for us lord no matter how bleak things may look in our lives lord maybe in our families lord in our in our work situations in our home situations oh god lord if there's still a knock at our door we know that you're still there oh god on the other side wanting to come in and fellowship we pray that lord that that door will be open to you right now lord jesus and that you come and fellowship with your people lord god we love you we appreciate you father bless all the mothers here this morning lord where lord as we celebrate this mother's day we're reminded of the one lord god that we've sing the song about you our mother our father our sister our brother oh god lord every day lord god is is is your day o jesus christ you're the one that we can nurse from the el shaddai lord god and we thank you for that as much as we thank lord even more than we even thank you for our natural mothers lord but as we set this day aside may you give each mother a special blessing may you help them to know how much they're loved lord not only by their natural families lord but by their spiritual ones lord and also by you lord jesus let them know lord god it's a tough trial lord that they go through raising children lord little trials they go through lord wanting to worry about the little ones here and there oh god even when they're out of the nest father that that love doesn't go away but i pray that you just be with them and comfort them give them a special blessing lord for their part and may you just be with each and every one as we depart this place be with our pastor lord as they're traveling with the family be with the new little baby of brother brooks's daughter's sister clara lord and also be with brother maxwell give him strength as he's traveling from place to place preaching oh god how it wears the body lord but you can strengthen the soul and the body we love you lord may you be with each and every one this morning bless all the ones that have come out lord to hear the word of god bless all the visitors lord all the different ones that have come lord and we just love you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we give you glory and honor and praise right now in the name of jesus christ amen amen also just came to my mind remember brother keith lindsay's sister lindsey was just telling me he's been kind of traveling here is he in ohio you say he's in ohio so just keep him in prayer i wasn't aware but i just heard that so well you know keep keep in mind you don't want to always keep in mind all the saints of god no matter where they're at if you know they're traveling you know uh i don't really get into facebook but my wife she kind of we'll keep in contact with some of the sisters on there and saw brother jesse's wife sister kristen just talking about traveling mercies on facebook the other night and how even though some people kind of make fun of it because it may not necessarily be in the scriptures as that traveling mercies but it's a real thing she said they'd just gone to the zoo with her little children in the van and they got out of the van after they came out to go home and the tire was totally flat and then when they looked at the tire they said it could have blown up at any time on the road and they were thinking about traveling she was going to travel with her husband with the whole family in that van and they ended up not doing it but god blessed them that it was able to go flat right there in the parking lot they got it fixed and have any problems so traveling mercies are a real thing amen we want to keep all that we love all the people of god we're not here to you know we miss when when any part of the body's gone we miss it i miss hearing brother brother keith's deep voice up in the front you know nobody can go i don't think anybody here can go as deep as brother keith and there's something to it that resonates it like makes my chest shake i enjoy it you know but you know we love each and every one if anybody desires prayer we're more than happy to pray with you we have brother isaac come and sing a few songs before dismissed
