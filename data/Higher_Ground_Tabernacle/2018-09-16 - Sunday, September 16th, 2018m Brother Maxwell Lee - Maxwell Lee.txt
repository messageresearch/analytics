Lord o God of zion Lord O God where there'll be peace forevermore Lord O God you said it's joy unspeakable and it's full of glory and a half has never yet been told Lord we want to thank you Lord and as we journey this way even in your word Lord Paul says how unsearchable riches Lord but Lord you want to thank thee for such a privilege that you have given unto us Lord that we could come Lord and you can make known Lord a mystery of your will there are people today Lord we pray that you may help us Lord as we come before your throne of grace Lord to sit at your feet to receive from you Lord we give you all the praise and the glory in Jesus name Amen praise God you may be seated we're so happy and thankful this morning to be in the house of God yet are not a privilege that we can come to recognize that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he never changes his mind about his word and you know it's such a privilege to pass this way once again with believers of like precious fate and you know we believe that we are on the final stretch this is going home time and the world has become you know in our reach because of technology what you may say a small you know global village and we tongue God the Word of God is being fulfilled it is all that we are living in and we are subjects to his kingdom and we truly believe the end is near and the world not is falling apart has already fallen apart but a Bride of Christ Jesus hallelujah is coming to that position to know her place and you know when we can know our place in Christ Jesus there is nothing that is happening around us we'll have a hole upon us because we are not mindful of what is happening around us because scripture has to be fulfilled but what is happening inside of us that is what really counts because the Word of God says that let not your heart be troubled believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you that he's gone to prepare a place for us that's where [Music] praise God so you know these these devices everything that man made how you know are always little problems and things but we tell God for grace this morning praise God so I was telling you you know we really had a wonderful time of fellowship many years ago in Trinidad where we have met in a convention and you know I really you know get a like him because of the boldness that he has and you know because when God speak we have to speak you know because that is what is lacking because we got a real recognize that you must know your position you must know your calling it doesn't matter where you go God is God Alleluia and the life that you're living I I never believed in what you may say in creating a first impression the world we see whenever you go wherever you go you must create a good first impression but that's the way of the world you know because when you do that what do you have leave behind if you try to impress or impersonate Gordon call us to be impersonators when God call us to be humble to believe his word hallelujah God call us to be honest and that is what we tongue God for and the best life or the best way that we could live is to live a honest Christian life by the grace of God and you know we truly believe in our that you are living in that God is moving amongst his people for his God so I bring you greetings from the church back in Georgetown Guyana it's in the capital and my from a wife and my family the the Christian Fellowship Tabernacle and we have other outreach churches but God has blessed us with other ministers who can Minister the Word of God and today you know there is not without anyone there so we town guard and also for your prayers and your support you know in prayer because we come to realize that it's the best thing that we can do you may not be there in your physical presence but in your prayers and we thank God for grace and I truly enjoy this time of fellowship in a way passing true tomorrow I'll be leaving for Arkansas with but a David Marsh near and then in Tennessee Johnson City and from there I'll be in Indiana Louisville and after that in New York and then back home by the grace of God so we covet your prayer hallelujah before he preach the Word of God I like try to sing this song if you if you believe the promise of tomorrow will banish all your sorrow no need to grieve if you believe [Music] it will be a brighter future and we're prepared to meet your every need if you believe if you believe so will it be [Music] it's true for me it's true for you somewhere down the narrow road he relieved your heavy load life supreme reward receive when you believe if your life is called inspiring and your days are long and tiring just receive when you believe [Music] nodding here in urk in measure up to heaven lasting treasure be not deceived only believe if you believe so will it be it's true for me it's two for you somewhere down the narrow road you relieve my heavy load life supreme award receive when you believe race the Lord praise God we're all believers we were chosen of God before the foundation of the world to believe and there is not enough devil in hell that can stop you from believing because the word says all things are possible to them that believe it and we found God the city let us all stand together as we turn into her Bibles in the Book of Isaiah chapter 14 reading from verses 26 just two verses of Scripture and for the thought this morning is conserved to his own purpose and served to his own purpose and we what is to conserve it's to keep something especially an important environmental or cultural resource from harm loss change or decay the importance of conserving or national heritage the saints of God we'd have beyond our national heritage it's a heavenly heritage that God has provided for us so God is conserved to serve his own purpose hallelujah Isaiah 14 26 this is the purpose that is purpose upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched upon all the nations for the Lord of Hosts had purpose and who child is knowledge and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back let's such shall be pretty gracious God and Heavenly Father Lord we do thank thee this morning for your word that we can come Lord and we could read the text Lord but it takes the Holy Ghost this morning to give us the context of your word we pray that you may help us Lord as we fellowship around your word that every human vessel will be hidden behind a veil that you could be seen this morning Lord we pray that you bless us Lord in Jesus name Amen praise God you may be seated we do realize that God has a purpose and God is purposeful in everything that he does God is not like us sometimes we do things and you don't have a real purpose in doing it we just doing it because we feel like doing it so and there is no purpose behind it and when we do that you know there's not much that we can get out of it but when you have a purpose in what you're doing at the end of the day hallelujah then you could see what God would have and we believe that before the foundation of the world before there was anything that was being created God had a purpose in his mind hallelujah and God's purpose hallelujah it's an eternal purpose and whatever God has chosen that he wants everything that he does to serve his purpose and we come to realize even us today here we were being created in the image and in the likeness of God the service purpose hallelujah and what we come to realize is not my will or your will but it's the will of him hallelujah but before anything could serve his purpose it had to come in a fullness of time because in the beginning we were in a mind of God hallelujah and we were just eternal thoughts and we were fellowshiping with him hallelujah but we come to realize that God was not satisfied just the fellowship with his thoughts he wanted to be tangible hallelujah because he had a blueprint he had in his mind from the beginning to the end what it would be hallelujah and he knows everything that will be taking place so that is why the part of God says that nothing that happens happened accidentally God is in it from the beginning to the end but the problem is we are the ones don't recognize what is happening and when things happen to our life in material it's an accident and some people might say well it's different kind of condition that is happening but God knows and when we are going through conditions of our lives sometimes we don't understand what we are going through and you know we may want to know what is happening but when we come true and we pass through things in our life then we can look back and see well this is what God was really doing in my life and now I can understand but you know what we come to believe and realize that God I really wanna stood try to understand his word God want us to believe hallelujah because when we try to understand it means that we use the human intellect and we try to figure out things and because we cannot see true in in figuration by our own thoughts then we begin to doubt and the devil will use our thoughts and in our mind because the proud of God says the greatest battle ever fought is in our mind and that is very Satan is battling us all the time but when we take God at His Word and believe his word then things will happen differently because we come to realize that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so when we look into the purpose of God's Word or his will hallelujah God don't read just on just have a purpose but he have a time and he have a season and also he has our people for his purpose to be fulfill and when we look down in the ages of time and we look at his seven ages hallelujah we come to realize that God was purposeful in everything that he's doing and even in the beginning when he created a heaven on the earth hallelujah in Genesis tells us in the beginning God created heaven and earth hallelujah it was formed it was real for man it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and God could not have done anything hallelujah in darkness and confusion but then God says let there be light and when God says let there be light then he began hallelujah the creation of his work hallelujah and when he finished those creation he says well it is good and when he created man he says it is very good so God know what purpose he was having hallelujah and the purpose in God's mind hallelujah was not just half but just have the spirit man but God took the dust of the earth and he form it into the image of man and then he breathed into man a bed of life and then man became a living soul so what all these things were happening what God had in his mind how lujah unless it was spoken it cannot be manifested aloha so it took the spoken word event God speaks hallelujah it has to come to pass because God and his word you can't separate him from his word and we got to come to realize if we are spoken word churn of God we cannot separate us from the Word of God so that is why we need to know what we are saying and what we are speaking because God has conserved to serve his own purpose hallelujah so don't you time and a season that we living in we see what God had in his mind hallelujah it is being fulfilled in each generation and in this generation we are a privileged people to be in this time and in this season because all the prophets and the seers they would have lied to live or to seed this day that we are living in because this is the blending in of time of eternity and with the ending of time which we call the millennium and since of God we thank God for His grace that we can come to recognize what God is doing in this hour hallelujah is giving us the victories in our lives that we need to be overcomers when we get trials and testings and things in our life is not for us to complain but we must come to realize that because God loved us he wants us to be overcomers and if we don't get things happening in our life then what are we going to overcome hallelujah and he says only the over can make it hallelujah because God wants us to be conquer he's the great and mighty Conqueror hallelujah because he overcame how lujah we also shall overcome and that is what God has given unto us so our purpose is to live a life above sin our purpose is to live a life above anything that the world has because we are sons and daughters of God they were being created lujah in his image and his likeness so in every time in every season God allotted seeds for every age Alleluia and we come to realize even in the dark ages there was a bride coming forth out of that age hallelujah so men saying today well it's only in this stage but in every age God had a word for a season he had the people for a season because every seed are lujah that comes forth as a dramatized seed it had to be laying there in the earth Alleluia and when it bring laid in the earth it has to die and it has to rot and God have us in this day hallelujah that we have to die at ourselves we have to die out to everything that is contrary to the Word of God that we can live Eluga so God has a purpose for every one of us and it doesn't matter how it seems that the prophet of God tells us that when God made you hallelujah and he made I that you cannot take my place and I cannot take your place and when we come to recognize that and we can see our purpose there is no competition in the things of God hallelujah because we are its one spirit we ought to come and in the spirit of the unity of the faith and if we realize our position every position in a body complements the other hallelujah that's the very same thing in the fivefold ministry no ministry is greater than the order the great one that we have is the Holy Ghost and when we can believe that he's the great one then we can be in harmony with the Word of God in a message I know my Redeemer liveth 5804 65 paragraph in 14 the prophet of God says then we find that in the day that all of the world was going destroyed by a flood that God made a preparation a preparation for what cause to preserve his purpose before they can be the flood before they can be anything God know exactly in his mind what will take place hallelujah and God had already every preparation God don't wait until something happened to find a solution God knows before something happened he already had a provided way hallelujah before you and I could even come into the world God knew who we would have been I lujah who would have been a father who would have been a mother or which country will be born into we could have never known that God as human excuse me we don't even have a choice to choose hallelujah if you want to be a man okay this excuse me it's a very strange thing for me to drink water but you know something like I think it's immature anyway you know we never had a choice what we want to be but that was God's will hallelujah and he conserve hallelujah that's his purpose that when we born what we what we will be so he was saying here what is happening God made a preparation a preparation for what cause to preserve his purpose he did it in the days of Noah hallelujah and he's doing it today he has made a preparation to conserve to his own purpose hallelujah that everything he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will conserve subjects for his great domain that death cannot destroy and we realized that it's my faith that we believe this but the resurrection produces a solid foundation of which of faith rests and he says nothing can destroy it so he says nothing can destroy it so by just reading this with the revelation there is nothing for us to be afraid of because he says nothing can destroy it and he says Kabir Khan's God has made a preparation to conserve his own purpose and we are the purpose of God because of you and I we are the purpose of God's creation because God whatever God has made he placed man to have dominion over everything that he has created alleluia God created our heavens and earth because of you because he wants you to be sons and daughters of God to come into your position and how long we cannot come into that position the Word of God says that the whole earth and the whole creation is groaning to witness the manifestation of the sons of God and how long we cannot fulfill God's purpose the creation will continue to grow until the bride come into fulness hallelujah and this is what the Word of God is to us when we look in the Old Testament when Adam and a and Eve fail hallelujah God came on the scene and he slayed a lamb hallelujah what God was doing God was preserving his own purpose he knew what would have taken place hallelujah and people saying well if God is so powerful and God knows everything why did Adam and Eve enter into that that was the purpose of God hallelujah he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a father hallelujah he wants to you see what we come to realize everything that God did hallelujah it's the service on purpose and as we go along the scripture will come to recognize that what God is doing haluya it was his own mind it was in his own thoughts because if God have a people at least conserving our people onto himself and we know that the way what God is doing the canoe is conserving us in this hour by the reveal restore word because we see that a whole world as being fallen apart and in every age is not at the beginning of the age is the ending of the age God always sends his word warning before judgment because if it's the beginning of the age by the time the eight is over everything will be corrupted hallelujah and there is nothing for the people to come back to but God is so gracious and merciful hallelujah you know the part of God made a statement he says God will allow things to be said things to be done that for the unbelievers hallelujah to blaspheme the word of God that they can did that judgment it must be right because God is not unjust God will not judge you without warning so God has conserved his own purpose and what we come to realize the bride in this hour must come under that headship Alleluia and the only way she could come by is by the Word of God so we can look down and we in through the Scriptures and we can see so many thing happening when we look back at Elijah when he had this showdown with the false prophets of Bel there was four hundred prophets and he was there and they said Oh God and answer by fire that would mean of God hallelujah so they were saying he told them that whatever you do make sure you don't light your own fire you don't do your own thing we are trusting we are calling on God and they they had their beliefs and they in their condition they were so sincere in what they are doing that they felt they were right and they call and there was not showdown but things of God is not your sincerity in what you feel that is right it must be a revelation by the Word of God because our emotion cannot save us our emotion cannot help us it takes the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us so and we do believe also emotion comes and goes but when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life scenes of God it's there to stay God never give his sons and daughters the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their life long in their soul and take it away God is not like the Indian giver to give and to take back and that is what you need the tongue God for today hallelujah your times in our life we can lose the joy of our salvation but since of God is always a way that could come back to the Word of God hallelujah that is why we need a filling and a refilling every time you feel the need in our lives we come before God and he can replenish us back again hallelujah so does show done started and got the God allow his prophet to tell the bill who are you well you take the first jump you do what you have to do God is never in a hurry hallelujah and God is not in competition to show off what he can do but God does what he has to do and that's every believer we also must do the very same thing so as they started to pray and they cry out and they jump and they shout and everything was going for them and time was going and you could see their emotion and they were getting tired after a while and he lied to say Oh probably a god is sleeping you got to cry a little harder shout a little harder and they cried and they shouted and so he said probably he's gone on a fire journey you know you got to speak a little call him back and it did already an and the emotions started rising and they started working their emotion I what happened he started jump on the altar and he started all BHEL BHEL and it was crying out before him and they started cutting themselves and blood come out of his skin and all these things are nothing can happen hallelujah but it's not in works that we can boast but it's in the grace of God so they were doing all of that and when the evening sacrifice came he light us as well this is my turn now you had all day to do what you had to do and there is no excuses now so you and the problem God says Elisha he was not just a believer but he was an inspired believer and that is what God wants us to be this hour everybody say well I'm a message believer and I believe the prophets message is beyond being a message believer hallelujah it's beyond coming to a message Church this message is not a concept but it's message is the reality of God hallelujah so what we find a concept you could understand it by intellectual conception but this message is a revelation from God that God conserves his own purpose hallelujah so that is why when you have the revelation of this message you cannot leave this message because you're part of God today you find mayor if you go many people say you know well I once believed the message and I leave the message because I believe the message is not true since of God if you really believe the message you can never leave it because the Word of God says nothing can separate us from the love of God so if the love of God is in your heart which is God Himself saints of God it doesn't matter what we have to go through our trials or testings and everything you will stay a ground with the Word of God so as an inspired believer Elida told him well you know I just don't want to pray to my god like that but first of all you did along the the altar a trench and I want you to fill it with water when God does something hallelujah it's different than what the world can do because when God does something hallelujah it will catch the attention you cannot say well it is a fake when God does something you know it's the supernatural you know it is God hallelujah God always vindicates his word so he writes ah he got him to do that and he set the evening sacrifice and he came before God and about before Elisha could have finished praying a lure of fire came down hallelujah and dried up the water and lit up the sacrifice hallelujah and the name of God was being praised on what happened all day they started saying that God is the God and Elijah took a sword and he slayed all 400 of those men those false prophets with the edge of the sword and then when the Jezebel heard what had taken place he said well he had killed my prophets I'm gonna get in and when he lied you heard that hallelujah the man stepped in and he said well I done all of this I'm the sacrifices I've trod on all the altars and destroy everything and now my life isn't returning so he says Lord he was hiding and he was running from that woman Jezebel he's suing you're under anointing you can feel so powerful but when you come back to the human element that is why we always need to have value you that anointing go into the depths of our soul when you have the Holy Ghost in your life there is nothing that can hinder you things of God God give you the victory so what happened he was running for his life from that woman jessabelle but after a while he came say Lord I'm not fit to live I've done this and I have done that and now I'm the only one remaining and what's the use that I'm here and my life is being threatened the Lord we say Elijah you're not the only one there are seven thousand who have never even borrowed their knees on to be here seeing some God so we can't what God has Conservatives on purpose and in this hour that we are living in sometimes we might feel you know that we are the only message believers around but they are the unheard off there are places you go right in your own country right in your own City there might be too and trees gathering together how we are under the banner of the message of the hour and we may not even know them but God knows hallelujah you might go into the jungles of the Amazon or into the savannahs of Africa and all these places but they are God's people everywhere God has conserved hallelujah to serve is to care for his own purpose God preserves his own purpose since of God you and I cannot preserve this message is this message that is preserving us you and I cannot defend this message is this message that is defending us because everything that we do is to serve God's purpose hallelujah and everything we believe in this hour it is just the grace of God towards us and what we come to realize nothing can destroy the true purpose of God because the true purpose of God stands in election hallelujah and that is what we believe in this hour so this message that God has given to us we come to realize that it's a message of faith because Abraham he we have an Abrahamic promise Allu that is not just given to you but those that even that is afar off hallelujah Abraham did not see everything in his day hallelujah but we in this hour we are the most privileged people what Abraham wanted to see way back then we are now seeing it now because God has placed us in this time and season but because we are children of a faith because of Abraham faith the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and Abraham we know her of his story of his life that he was seeking a city whose builder and maker is God Abraham was a rich man he was having 318 servants and he had everything that he could think of but yet he was not satisfied because the things of the world cannot satisfy the spiritual that was within the inside because we came from God we have to go back to him because the life Zoe is in sorry you it takes a spiritual life sins of God even in this world that we living in all the social amenities no matter what we have still that cannot bring that kind of comfort to us because how many beds you can sleep in at the same time how many vehicles you could drive at the same time how many different dishes are our meals you can eat at the same time and even if there is your favorite after a while you'd go so much it's about I don't feel like eating this anymore I am you know I'm just dissatisfied and you will want something new because there's a thirst within the inside and the only thing that can fulfill that thirst is when you come into the understanding of whom to know means life eternal hallelujah so we can thank God for the message of the hour we are being brought up in denominations and in different places or we were in the barnyard but when we heard a voice came to us hallelujah then something inside because God had a purpose God's purpose was not for us to be in denomination and in cults and in different things but God's purpose for us hallelujah is to be in him hallelujah so when we are being placed upon the face of the earth as we say before there's a time and there's a season and this season God has pleased hallelujah that we can come forth as his sons and his daughters to be the bride in this generation so it's just the grace of God in this power that we are living in and the part of God as we continue in the same message I know my Redeemer liveth Barbara 15 all powers of Hell might wager against it but but it will prevail louia we have God's eternal promise there may be teachers there might be ISM Rises there might be great program Rises there might be things that look like that it would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of God to see that it will prevail Alleluia didn't Peter and all the the disciples and the order the scribes and the Pharisees and everybody was there and they're saying whom do some say that I am some City Elias John the Baptist some say you know every different things but he turned to Peter whom do you say that I am Peter says thou art a Christ the Son of the Living God and he said Simon Peter flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father which is in heaven upon upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it it was not built upon Peter but it was built upon a revelation of a Lord Jesus Christ the saints of God we have God's eternal purpose there might be teachers they might be isms rise there might be great program rise and we see what is happening in this day Alleluia all kind of things is coming up and is rising and a part of God says don't bother with those things that come and fly around these things you must believe the word for the hour because things will come and things will go but a Word of God stands for all eternity hallelujah so what we come to believe with all the isms and every program there might be things that look like that it would be destroy but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of God to see that it will prevail so he says then it's not up to me it's not up to you where it will be destroy or not it's up to God and and we can rest assure on it that God will never let our heritage be destroyed for it is his purpose to give it to us all we are God's heritage can never be destroyed it doesn't matter how low it seems to be and for elect seed of God Alleluia once your being elect of God the prod of God's is a true elect seed of God can never commit the unpardonable sin it doesn't matter how slow you stoop in sin and what you have done in your life hallelujah God will never allow you to cross that line because you are a heritage of God and you're conserved to serve God's purpose he conserves the things of God he conserves a people he conserves his church that we can come and you can worship Him so what is happening today many temple go around say oh my I don't know what is happening around the message you know the churches seemed to be so frail and so many things are happening I don't know what is happening we got to stop murmuring and complaining the prophet of God says that a bride is right in our position that nothing is out a cater with the bride so if nothing is out a cater with a bride it means that we are not looking in the right direction we are looking into things and places that we should not even be looking we should not be looking for perfection and a brother and a sister you should look for perfection in your very own life by the Word of God but it called us to look at look at each other for example christ jesus is our example hallelujah and paul says follow after me as i follow after him i'll follow me as I follow Christ so we know that what we are doing today that we have the leadership of the Holy Spirit that we can come and saints of God we are we can rest assured it that God will never let her heritage be destroyed for it is his purpose to give it to us you know why because he is the chief Cornerstone hallelujah and the whole foundation is builded upon him and that Brides position today is in him and if you are in him there is nothing for us to be afraid of because God is in charge of every situation hallelujah and that is what you got to come to realize is not what the world is doing or what is happening outside but is what is happening inside of you that is what you got a comforter remember we are Gentiles what God is dealing with us as individuals and when you're dealing one-on-one hallelujah it's a better relationship that we can have such a fellowship in this hour with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so we got to come to realize since of God that God has a kingdom hallelujah he's the king of kings because though he says that he will conserve subjects for his great domain so how can God have a domain and he's a king and he don't have subjects hallelujah and how can we say that we are Chernov the king and we don't know who our king is he's our king of kings and he's the Lord of lords hallelujah so that is why we come to realize that we have come under headship and headship is not what you may say bondage headship is a privilege when we come under his headship there's nothing for us to worry about hallelujah because we come to realize people are worrying in their life or what is going to happen to this world what is going to happen to our country what is going to happen to our children since of God that should not be our worry hallelujah so you know why worry when we have the faith in God Alleluia what we need to do is to believe God the devil always want to obscure your mind with all different kind of things hallelujah but we know that according to the Word of God our life stands in election before the foundation of the world we were chosen in him hallelujah you can turn with me to our Bibles and a book of Ephesians chapter one reading from verses 9 he says he fission's chapter 1 verses having made known unto us the mystery of whose will of his will according to WHO his good pleasure with who he had purposed in himself so it doesn't have nothing to do with your eye we don't have a choice but if God has elected you to be his son and daughter there's nothing can stop you from that that in the dispensation of the fullness of time that who but he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance so he see we are part of it in whom also we have obtained in heritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work at all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom also he ought trusted after that he heard the word of truth we thank God that faith called by hearing and hearing by the word and the word for did a reveal word for this day hallelujah which we have heard and the know the word says that all things are possible to them that believe it so in whom that we all trusted after that he heard a word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed he were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise Alleluia which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so since of God we can count God for that hallelujah because while we were yet sinners he shed his blood he gave his life for us hallelujah we were not conscious of what was happening Alleluia but when we heard a message like that little Eagle in the barnyard then our consciousness hallelujah came in that we are not chickens but we are Eagles then we realize that we're sons and daughters of God then we realized that we are the Bride of Christ Jesus hallelujah coming into the place that God would have of us so God promised to give us his life that we can be sealed with the holy spirit of promise Alleluia are not just for a moment but until the very end hallelujah through all eternity because once seal always see Alleluia nothing nothing can break that seal even God Himself hallelujah cannot do because God is perfect and whatever God does hallelujah he know exactly what he's doing we as human we do things and when we find that you know well I don't think I had it right at the beginning by the moment you thought it was right and then you have to do an addition to make it become perfect in your sight but God will have to do that God is perfect in all his ways from the beginning to the end and time does not change God Alleluia because he's the same yesterday today and forever and there was nothing in time that could change God in time we do things in our life and we have to change our plans but since God never changes man of his word because He is God and he knows everything and we need to come into the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost by the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in Ephesians 3:9 tells us Ephesians chapter 3 verses 9 he says and to make all men see that what is the Fellowship of the mystery with from the beginning of the world had being hidden God who created all things in the big it was hidden in God at the beginning he who created all things but in a fullness of time we come to realize that God wants us hallelujah to know everything that he has because the proud of God all what God had he pour into Christ on everything Christ Jesus that he put into us the bride in this day so everything that was hidden before the the foundation of the world from the beginning in time God hallelujah through the revelation of his word to us through his will that we could come into recognition to know the mind of God hallelujah so according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus Lord in whom we have boldness and access but confidence my fate of him saints of God so we have a boldness we have a confidence by the faith of him Alleluia who have called us out from darkness into his marvelous light hallelujah that we in this hour that we shall show forth his praises and we thank God today that we all be living epistles read and seen of all men because everything that God is doing God has conserved everything to serve his purpose and this is what he is doing Alleluia in the in the sardian church age paragraph 2 79 - 3 it's a church issue chapter 7 it tells us here the part of God was saying he says the purpose of God it stands in election so he see what is the purpose of God stands in election Alleluia it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself Alleluia the woo that would be a word bride that's imagine that listen now she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him so the bride is not now the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world in him the prophet of God says she was foreknown and not only for known but beloved before she was ever brought forth she was beloved before she was ever brought forth hallelujah during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed onto her saints of God what a privilege people that we are conserved this on purpose that should make us happy that's a make us live in victory and not to be defeated by the enemy when the enemy comes in like a flood is a standard and sins of God the standard is the very word of God for us because the purpose of God stands in election and we had nothing to do with the election of God it was all in the mind of God or what we have to come a lujah because God placed his life in us we cannot do anything more than to accept the plan of God for our life we should never fight against the Word of God because God have chosen us in himself that we should serve Him didn't John John says who serve is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God so what should we be afraid of a true Christian hallelujah cannot sin a true Christian you only make mistakes and a cinnamon the man who is a sinner out there he can do because he's born in sin and everything you think about is sin where you have the mind of Christ since of God when you make a mistake you don't willfully want to make a mistake that is why he says we don't sin we make mistakes and we thank God for grace because of the seed of God in you you have no desire to sin if we have a desire to sin something is wrong in the inside it mean that as a corrupt seed because when you have the mind of Christ or what you want to do is to please him hallelujah and in pleasing God sometimes we try to go about in the wrong way and we end up like Jacob Jacob Moses a planter he was a deceiver but he is motive and his objective was to receive the birthright and sometime you want a blessing in our life but we go about it in the wrong way that is why God looks at your motive on your objective that is what God looks at hallelujah God look at us on the outside God looks at us in the inside because that is what really speaks is the really the inside man that God is looking at Alleluia so you come to realize in first Peter 2:9 tells us what he are a chosen generation Alleluia you're a royal priesthood you're a holy nation you're a peculiar people that he should show forth the praises of him who had called you out from darkness into his marvelous light gaurav we are to show peace of God the bride is guards show peace Alleluia to the world that a world want to know Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he has been revealed to his bride his people but today the bride has become a mystery to the world they don't know what is really taking place but you know who you are in Christ Jesus hallelujah praise God so but he are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood you're a holy nation you are peculiar people that he should so for the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people remember you were Gentiles we never were looking for nothing we were just there just doing what we want to do we had no hope but are now the people of God which he says which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy the Jews were seeking and what the orders they were signed seekers and they were looking in the Stars and all different things but what you and I were doing we had no thought we had no mind towards anything hallelujah so but now I read now but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy says dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war it against the soul having a conversation honest among Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation so by the way that you live man can glorify God they might say or Mara evil against you but you know where you're standing when you're standing upon the Word of God sayings of God you don't care what people have to say because remember you are peculiar people I what is peculiar that which is one's own belonging to one's possessions are people selected by God from the other nations for his own possession you may not be anything to anybody else but you are a chosen generation but you are a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people talk so for the praises of him I loo you who have called your from darkness into his marvelous light so we come to recognize that the hour that we are living in is just the grace of a Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that we can recognize that every seed must bring forth of his kind so that is what God is doing from the time the world begun in in the book of Genesis in time God is conserved to serve support the service for his own purpose Alleluia and we come to realize that what God is doing hallelujah nothing can stop God's program it doesn't matter if we don't believe or not God will do what he has to do i Lu you you know the proud of God says it at Pergamon Church 8 paragraph 171 he says here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is is that each species bring forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 111 where God says let the earth bring forth grass and a herb yielding seed and a fruit tree yielding or fruit after his kind whose season himself upon the earth and it was so so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and dense into the fruit the very same law applies to the Church to D so the prod of God says whatever seat started in the church will comfort and be like the original seed because it is the same seed God didn't change the seed God and change his word what started out in Genesis will continue right down to the very end because it is perfect and a Word of God can never be contaminated it can never be crossbred by any other seed because it is being kept by himself hallelujah so it's the same seed and in these last days the true bride church Christ seed will come to the headstone the true bride church why did he say true bride church because you have lots of church everybody say well be our bride be a message believers but saints of God not all Israel are Israel but God has his chosen he knows and you know who you are hallelujah so Christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super Church a super ace as she nears him hallelujah they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is an order to be united with him hallelujah what a privilege people we are this morning hallelujah that we could come and we can be united with him hallelujah praise is one of her name day in a bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denomination cannot produce this you know why because it's the wrong seed on a wrong seed hallelujah can never produce something that is good hallelujah so denominations cannot produce this the wrong seed they will produce their Creed's and their dogmas mix the word this mongrel icing bring 40 a hybrid product what is manga realizing mix up this is where you find a lot of mixing up today car don't want to us to be mixed up with the world and the things of the world Alleluia even that is why a proud of God he was saying that even us as believers under no circumstance a believer should ever married to an unbeliever and this is the very word of God is the many cause was believer there is no mixing up there is the Word of God Alleluia because in Romans 11 16 tells us for if the first-fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches so he is the vine and we are the branches so what expect me ought to be and he says if the branches don't bring forth fruit what he's gonna do he's gonna chop them off and saints of God when John came in his day preaching what he says he generation of vipers who had warned you of the coming of the Lord he said the axe is already laid to the root saints of God since the message came we come to realize the actors already laid at a root so we already bringing forth fruit in this day that we are living in hallelujah because we come to realize that same power that God has given to those in the book of Acts when he went up into the Upper Room is that same power we shall be having today we should have that very same faith when we look at us and may look at what was happening in the book of Acts sometime if we seem so far away from what they were doing because the matter says don't they when they came out from the upper room you know what drove them into the upper room they had a commission to go but God allowed conditions to happen all who that fear came upon them and many of them they were being driven by fear and when they went into the upper room they locked the windows and a lock and they closed the doors hallelujah and they were there there crying out to God because they were afraid you know that a conquer will come and get them and there we put the debt but God allow it to happen because he give a commission going to the upper room to be endued with power from on high and then you're going to be commit mice's louia many of them probably wanted to just be you know just go true and become witnesses but God has a provided way before any man or woman holu departed even before you can even take communion you must have the Holy Ghost Alleluia so more much less more to be a servant of God the standing behind a pulpit you must have a relationship with God I loo as we cannot be true witnesses for him Alleluia so we come to realize what took place when the Holy Ghost came upon them they lost they forget about all the affairs they are being delivered and those same men that were running from the life they flung the doors on a windows open and they ran upon the streets and I be here to preach the gospel Alleluia and look how many more being baptized after the day of Pentecost when Peter preached hallelujah is this a man and well what shall we do he says repent and be baptized in the name the Lord Jesus Christ and when the Apostles Alleluia God began to move the Bible says that fear came into their hearts of the people are we seeing that is happening today we got to come into the power a demonstration of the Holy Spirit our life has to be worthy of this gospel Alleluia we cannot live double lives and then expect that people they will look and see God in manifestation we don't have a church life and a home life and a going-out life it has to be one life hallelujah and the best the prouder of God spoke a lot on home life I'll charity begins at home is not when you come into the church to travel and you live like a devil and you're during the weekend when you come to church on a Sunday you want to be a saint there's no double standard with the Word of God hallelujah the right atmosphere have to be created on a home if you have strong homes Alleluia strong families then they'll have a strong church because they say that we gotta come to realize as parents we are to train up our children and the fear of the Lord in a way they oughta grow that when they of a do not depart from the word of truth Alleluia so we come to realize the day that we're living in we are not fighting against flesh and blood but it's our prince of parties and a power that is why God have conserved the service on purpose hallelujah he's serving his own conserved so we have to serve his purpose hallelujah in the day that we are living in that we could go by the grace of a Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we can thank God for everything because there is a provided way for every son and daughter of God that we could love him that we could serve him with all our heart and all our soul it all I was straight I Louie what a wonderful hour that we are living in hallelujah the product the Bible tells us in in 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verses 9 who had save us and who and and called us with a holy calling not according to our works Alleluia but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began Alleluia we were were we were in his mind Alleluia we were there but it's now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ what abolished debt and had brought life and immortality to the light through the gospel so true this gospel we receive life Alleluia what happened he became us that we can become him Alleluia today in a world we find that you have many great men in a world today and they want to become God they want to take God's position but I want to tell you something it's only one God became man hallelujah Hakan descend that he can save us from our sins and that was the fulfil it was to conserve his purpose hallelujah because we come to realize the blood of bulls and of boot cannot fulfill that position it was just for a time it was just for a season and there was still a heavy conscience but when Christ Jesus came hallelujah it was once and for all by the grace of a Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so saints of God we don't have nothing to about we just have to believe the Word of God we just have to trust in him with all of her heart and all her soul with all her strength because there is grace in a word of God for his people hallelujah we need to stay with a word of God because his his life that is being placed in us and if God's life is in us then saints of God no matter how the devil tried to take your life he can't because when job was in a condition the devil was walking to and fro up and down the earth and God said you consider my servant job look at the EAC yeah because you put a hedge around him because you give him a good wife and churn and you give him wealth and everything that is why he's serving you so there was a challenge it was not job was doing anything wrong in his life but sometimes God is a showdown between God and the devil and God uses you as the part I loo in knowing that what he does how lujah that you're his sons and his daughters do you know the prod of God says one time he says we thank God and they're men and women that can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do that I want to be that kind of person that we can live so close to God you know why because God preserve his own purpose he conserved to his own purpose things of God and nothing can destroy God's purpose hallelujah so we come to recognize that what happened the devil tried everything with Joel hallelujah took away all his wealth and everything that he had and even his children and everything and job said the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh blessed be the name of the Lord ever say what all this I'd done in this man still serving God Saints Oh God the way of a believer ought to confuse the enemy that he don't know what to do saints of God when we can feed upon the Word of God hallelujah then we know our position in him what our that we're living in we need to thank God for grace in a message watchman what of the night 58 11:30 paragraph 20 he says now where are we in the day that we live can turn into the pages of this blessed word and find a very thing that he said would take place approaching on the earth today the signs and the wonders are taking place men's hearts are failing for fear we see that is happening we see there's so many many earthquakes all across the nation around the world we in Guyana we are not far away from the earthquakes and we never really had no kind of tremors are not quake but just about a month ago we had one just the tail end coming from Venezuela about a 7.3 and I was sitting in a chair I want to know how the place is shaking and I see how everything was going like that I said well God you know is everything but a proud of God tells us that when we see these things are happening it is only a buzzer to let us know that a coming of the Lord is near we should not be afraid when we hear about these what we call it the Hurricanes and it tournedos on all these different thing is so not for us to be afraid but for us to look up because a Redemption draweth nigh so what we seeing here he said the signs and our wonders are taking place and men's hearts are failing for fear if you don't have the Holy Ghost in you then all kind of fear going to take you over Alleluia so there is a perplexity of time and distress between nations fearful sights in the sky like flying saucers the Pentagon all stirred up and the sea are roaring and earthquake in divert places sometimes we'd in a day they say they're over 50 tremors are out quickly Kennedy could you imagine that I long ago you can know you hear art quit now and many years after then you hear one but a rapidity of things it's coming on because you know why the whole earth the creation is groaning the witness the manifestation of the sons of God since ago we got to come into our position the word is bringing us into that place we by ourselves can't do that that is why we need to feed upon this word of God that he has given unto us hallelujah so the Pentagon stores see roaring earthquake divert place remains hearts of fearing of falling in fear great atomic weapons setting waiting and more than this which is worst of all a gloom hanging on the earth that the world has never witnessed before it is so difficult for people to serve God for Pele to prey on all these things they're just in a casual position and a buckless so raging saints of God that is why as we see that they approaching we ought to be in fellowship we ought to be more and more in the house of God because Satan is raging what a Word of God says when the enemy comes in like a flood there's a standard that is being raised up against it and that is the very this is the ravine word a message every hour that God has given unto us it has everything to take us true we don't have to look for nothing more to come this is already a vindicated message hallelujah I don't have to do things to see the the pillar of cloud or the light before me to know that this message is real it has already been vindicated or what we after this to believe the Word of God and He will take care of the rest of everything hallelujah so a groom is hanging on the earth that a world has never witnessed before this should not make us be afraid but we should believe the Word of God because the promise is being given on to us on and to our children and even to those that are far off saints of God that God will preserve his heritage God will take care of all everything that he has upon the face of the earth there is nothing for us to worry about a lawyer all what we need to do is to stay with a word for the hour that God has provided for us hallelujah how many you willing to stay with a message of the other it cannot fail God cannot fail his word can't fail so if God can't feel his word can't feel a new part of God you're gonna feel there is no failure and sons and daughters of God I look God never say much to lose us I look God is not enough profit and lost business we do business and we have a profit and loss Alleluia but God all things are possible to them that believe it hallelujah you know in a message hear his voice the proud of God was telling us of the mother Eagle that's how you know powerful she is and there is no worry for those little Eagles because when the coyote comes and tried to take one of those little one what a mother Eagle does she will fly down and swoop them and take him up and probably take him a thousand feet up in the air and loose him on the cliffs and when he hit there are lujah is gonna be smash to Smith or be disintegrated I'll do it so there's not interfere so he was saying here that nothing going to bother them little ones are we not little ones hallelujah so he says she's going to see to it the product God says nothing is going to bother them little ones nothing gonna bother you don't be scared to take God at His Word he said we should not be a scared to take out of this word are you scared to take God at His Word many times we may have things in our lives but a part of God says we have to separate from our feelings between our feelings and our faith so if you take God at this word you don't think about how you feel you think about what the Word of God says because I say feelings and emotion comes and goes but when you take God at His Word and you believe God's Word everything that is contrary that a Word of God has to depart from our lives hallelujah so the part of God says just relax can you relax in the presence of God in your situation that you're going through he says just relax have faith and believe that he is watching over you it's not man watching over us hallelujah is not the federal or the police or the government or the FBI or the CIA or the KGB is the Holy Ghost as God himself so nothing can destroy you he said he's watching over you and the proud of God many say well he just had a seventh grade education but some words that he used you got to go in a dictionary to find it hallelujah is not true he says it's he is watching over you he will disintegrate anything that tries to you Alleluia what is the D centigrade to break into components or fragments Alleluia or breaking something into small pieces or constituent part to destroy the cohesion or unity are the wholeness of something or undergoes such destruction and we commonly use a term blow to smithereens Alleluia so he says he is watching over you he was disintegrate anything that tries to bother you he says well it might attack you but it can't harm you the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom may devour he might attack you but he can't harm you and since of God are you thankful today it doesn't matter what the devil tried to do to you that you're the apple of God's eye and you're conservative on purpose so we should not be afraid to worship God we should not be afraid to serve Him in the fullness of life that he is given hallelujah oh it might attack you but it can't harm you for all things he permits it it could be nothing else for it's working together for good to them that love the Lord no harm can come to you so since of God no harm can come to you it's conserved his own purpose Isaiah 59 19 tells us so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and His glory from his rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise the Spirit of God or the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him what a hope or a confidence that God has given unto us that we have hope in this hour that we are living in Psalms 23:4 it's a very familiar little portion of Scripture yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff and they comfort me so what a mighty God we are serving today saints of God Alleluia we should give him all the praise and the times of what he had done for us in this hour Alleluia he will disintegrate anything that tries to bother us this morning Alleluia we have a we have a glorious hope as his people this gospel is only for a trillant saints of God when the seals were open there was still a supernatural elementary name Alleluia and only the true Bride of Christ can catch that because it is not open to the intellectuals it is open to those that are faith in the Word of God and in 2nd Corinthians chapter four verses three the seven tells us but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost are too thankful to know that your recipient of God's love and in this day you can receive the message of the hour Alleluia praise God in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not who's the god of this world kahlan god of this evil age lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who's an image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves as servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness that shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellence of power may be of God and not of us we thank God that the purpose of God truly saints of God it stands in election that is where the purpose of God stands and we were elected chosen of God before the foundation of the world and because of that you know because of predestination many times people have the wrong understanding of predestination is the OM predestinated of God and you know God loved me so much I could do anything oh wait if God loved you would not God you can't do anything you could only do what God will have you to do if you're truly predestinated of God you will not want to do anything that is contrary from the will of God because that seed of God in you cannot sin it will not allow you to go contrary when you see things are contrary something is contrary with their lives and you need to come back the Calvary you need to come back to the altar to recognize that something is not really right that is why we need to stay with a fullness of the word that God has given unto us saints of God without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins and we come to recognize the grace of God because the first coat that I read before in the saddest in church age it was telling us first of all we know Moses shortly that a purpose of God stand in election hallelujah and it was the purpose in himself it was God's purpose to bring further people unto himself that would be a word bride not a world bride not a worldly bride but a word bride since of God there might be many brides but there's only one bride that is coming for and that's the word bride Alleluia she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and she was beloved before she was ever brought forth saints of God we should be a happy thankful people to know that before years brought forth we were loved so what could really change that if you know before your daily is delight you know we could turn I think it's proverbs chapter it in proverbs chapter 8 we can read from verses 22 it says probably 22 the Lord possess me in the beginning of his ways before the works of old I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the art was when there were no depths I was brought forth when there were no fun things abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought food while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he said he come pass upon the face of the earth when
