lord areas in our life Lord that no one else sees but you keep us under your atoning blood and all gotta let your word go forth today empowering and demonstration in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ we pray that church say Amen amen you have your Bibles let's turn to Genesis the fifteenth chapter Genesis 15 Genesis 15 I want to start reading at verse 1 and then we're gonna go to Hebrews the sixth chapter Genesis 15 and 1 if you have a say man the Bible says after these themes the word of the Lord the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said Behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is my hair and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine hair but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir amen let's go to Hebrews 6 chapter Hebrews six and I want to start at verse 13 Hebrews 6 and 13 the Bible says fooling God may promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for me and verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible that God impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us and maybe the Lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen and as you see it I want to turn over to Matthew the 13th chapter and I want to read a couple verses out of there Matthew 13 if I can start at verse 10 saying the disciples came and said unto Him why speakest thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath have to a barbarous program for whosoever hath to him shall be given into him shall not shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he has therefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing in their eyes they have closed lest at any time they shall see with their eyes and hear with their ears and she'll understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them amen you know Church I want to preach today by the grace of God on a subject the heritage of faith you know the heritage of faith when you think of a heritage you think of something that's passed down from generation to generation and normally that's how God works God has been passing down his word from generation to generation you know it a marvel act you know the Bible that the disciples they were listening to Jesus and while Jesus was talking to you know the Sadducees and Pharisees and different ones they could understand what God was saying but the people he was speaking to he was speaking to them in parables and they asked the question they said why do you speak to them in parables and Jesus was simply saying you know it is given to you to understand he's inherited an ear to hear that God is saying he was saying that these people can hear me preach and they don't understand nothing they can look at the Word of God and they have no understanding he said but as for you it's been passed down as for you you were born with the gift to understand God Hey and sometimes church you know we run their words God doing sometimes we just need to step back and let God work oh yeah because the Bible says hiya that I cannot hold it he cannot change his ways he cannot fall back whatever God said it had to come to pass you know it looks in the scriptures like sometimes God is wavering you know God told Adam and Eve the day you tempted them for being food you don't die and it look like it didn't happen but they didn't hire you our bodies are suffering from what Adam and Eve did in the beginning honey we are experiencing a natural death because of what they did showing that God word will come to pass but you know when I look at the word heritage I look at something being passed down you know I'm from the south and then and you know if this real touchy in the south there's something we have and I hope I don't mean to put you on the edge of your seats but in the south we have something called racism honey by the grace of God those were the holy days that don't bother you but you know our South Carolina is known for its heritage is known for something retired a conservative side but I said like this before they acknowledge or they may know that the Confederate flag was homeless big house we in our heritage we remember back reason there was up there so we may begin to bring it out this time to talk about your a meeting over there where to come from it didn't mean a thing to me because from our heritage our parents did not pass down on the hurt and all the things that took place during the time of a silverware or or what the flag meant so when they begin to fight over this floor then you got one group writer where our parents were in the world and you got a little room saying well our parents were slaves so you got one sled with two different meanings of hair Oh matters and you got you got one God we're all use different meanings of heritage holy whatever God said in his word is true hello the wages of sin is death oh yeah he said you don't reap what you sow hey man and if you so give me good the Bible says hungry then a good team came brave for evil fruit and a bad tree came rain from good food amen that's God's Word it's in your seed that's most pass down hey and you know as I look and I begin to think you know just in our own state you know racism is like you know what I don't believe nobody's racism here I'm just making a point racism is something that's passed down it has to be talked you know it has to be given to a child or to a person from somebody else's understanding but really I love about God whenever we learn about God God wants us to personally know ourself he wants us to personally understand him now even ever mama a daddy passed down their knowledge of Christ but you have to get to a place where you know Christ for yourself oh yeah we're not I'm not gonna make it a heaven on the merits of my parents God is gonna ask me what have I go with this Christ heritage and when I looked at whenever you look at our state and they begin to boycott because they looked at the flagon what the Frog meant all the hatred and all these things and I thank God for the way I was raised I wasn't raised with my parents passing down the knowledge of slavery or the knowledge of all the things that happen in all the generations before me what they taught me was you can be anything you wanna be hallelujah shishi they think they tap into a heritage that was fruitful amen they tap into a hare there can be all things in Christ you didn't tell me you know what the one thing I don't identify with as a black man I don't identify what people say we're still in the struggle hey I gotta go God is on my side I wanna deal with the struggle at all with the struggle of the 19 bills in the nineteen that I'm in the year the TV and you know oh yeah when you think like that you're not you're not looked upon good holier because the man said is in a different place oh yeah it's the old boy it's hard out here for the black man if you don't know God that's why I love going to the ranch a holy you can see a black man down a bit Lee huh huh hey everybody stay with me now I'm talking natural saga make a spiritual point what I'm saying is holy what's being passed down to you with a secular present-day life it affect the way you live you know affect your children honey you know young man can watch how his daddy treats his mom and he'll treat his wife the same way that will become a part of his heritage and his dad is filled with the Holy Ghost that young boy learned holiness how to love his wife he learned how to take care of family he learned how to provide that becomes his heritage that becomes something that's passed down but if his father is a deadbeat he got to meet God personally and that God teach him honey they can be done he can be raised in a fatherless home but God you still get care gotta still contact you see we're in a day now where there are no more excuses heylia oh yeah people say well I'm like just because of that I'm like just because of you what you said to me what you did to me everybody makin excuses when I really want to take higher responsibility for the decisions we make cuz we can we can truly say ujin every one of us right now nobody else put a gun to our head and said I want you to come to church tonight we've made that decision so Church when we look at God I know how the Bible says that there is no greater than God no one else could do what needed to be done so God said I'm gonna swear by myself I'm gonna make sure Abraham you have this child I'm gonna make sure to see the life that you're deciding what you want to pass down I will make sure it happens by my oh yeah and that's the greatest thing about being a Christian your life does not belong to you your life belongs to come do you think me your man young man born in the South raised in the Sun we want to be up in our when it's minus degrees up it snow everywhere can you walk to the car like you want to you got to be no church I'm here because of the calling of God I'm here because there was something passed down to me that I have no control of touch when I was born God put a gift of evangelism in my life Baga were a gift of faith in my life holy God put a praise inside of my seat doctor worshiping me holy God put a fight in me put something holy they said you were born a cop I didn't make myself that way holy that's in the genes in church holy we inherit death and all he says God is He that is in me then he led us in the world I didn't put God in me God regarding me choosing the life of Christ we have to take her for something Prosser oh yeah it's too many times we don't take God serious but just we're in a time when we should be expecting to see more of God in our lives you know and you know from the rails point of view people think they're getting away they think everything is alright because they everybody's looking at this person they said well and then happen to them yet and then happened to this person they were God cannot lie whenever he said he's too happy he's gonna be a tribulation it's gonna be a binding of the son he's gonna be a role is known is gonna be a nuclear bomb he's God happens hurts just like the Bible says just as show as we have a pump we don't have it come the Bible I already said hurry that she was priceless she was shipped on the heel and members of 666 is written in the Bible and just the show is I can see that I can see her your judgement is on the way home just a show God said in the last days honey it's gonna be whales and weasels are where they will be getting mad and giving man it's gonna be homosexuality times we can see it it's been passed down from generation to generation and now we had the part of the pinnacle with the part of the fool is sometimes the manifestation of God is here and we can see the devil in his fullness we ought to be able to see God in its full but speaking on the heritage I'm gonna be loan don't get nervous but y'all know I'm like a 747 I need a little room while I'm up there I can't just bring Julian I'm the helicopter I go up and down no I just can't go up and down I like the girl didn't stay up there a while Haley but you know church when I think about the heritage what we inherit like I was saying about racism you know you took her you took a young man or young woman that grew up in a Christian home the example is set before them you young ladies you want to know what kind of life you should live look at your Christian mother you don't mean you want to know what kind of life you want to live look at your Christian father that's the hatches that's being passed down to you but he got to accept it by faith faith is the heritage that we are receiving anything and we are the children of Abraham we receive holy life by faith hallelujah Jason when I look at this you're Abraham he told God he said Lord he said I don't have any children he said all I got is this Eliezer of Damascus in my house all I got is a servant to give what I got oh I got a remain that's not even connected to my bloodline to pass down all these riches and all his greatness he says god I want my own seat and then God comes back and sometimes you got to stir you problem is we have our own desires so we don't go to the size the size it's a lot I'm gonna wait do you speak to me and don't let nobody put you under pressure to move when you don't want a new honey you stand still and wait on God sometimes we too busy following one another wait oh god that's what I level by the heritage of david dave' you take David you take Solomon there for them serve the same God but but but the Solomon was a little bit different than David even though he was the same bloodline Solomon handle things different from the way David held Solomon he would reason Solomon had a thousand lives some of those can make one happen how you go made a thousand happen you got this one said I will agree temple the air temple some of you got the money I want to go on temple Maddie you got all them lies in you here and you got to make somebody happy and then God huh who so rich in mercy he told Solomon stay away from him strange women they go turn no heart from me huh God nobody talking about you tell you something he's talking about he wasn't trying to keep songs from prison when he returned news not song Samuel Solomon from prison he was trying to keep Solomon from his heart being touched from him but Solomon caught up because he watched a you know everything I got a gift for wisdom I got a gift like no other man I can see what other people can't see but he couldn't see very simple thing God told him stay away from them women God talking to somebody today honey God might be telling somebody stand away from that thing that you want so bad you think is all right though we want it so bad we like bingo one is open go to God go to God and prayer so no what should i do these cheaper easier God said man you can't curse was blessed what kind of company you in stay away from a man who people blessed Balaam said oh yeah okay deep let's go back he says hey you know what buddy like God told me these people are blessed and then they like say hey well I got bleeding money I got plenty of money I can buy you things you know they got a new Maybach coming out spin around in it yeah I could hook you read wound up so bingo he started to think about rubbers Devon think about Godhead already spoke to Gino and he think about reason about God is already spoke the problem is the Bible says honey a person can think that they write in a way and be just as long as two left shoes but they looking for their own self justification and Baylin was looking for his own self justification he said you know what I'm gonna go back to God again God came out and he said the people were blessed they were blessed I want you to understand this church Balaam is now going back to God like God started like God didn't like gossip we were bailiffs I ain't quite sure can you imagine speaking to God and God Himself is not sure do that sound like a God do you regard speak that's what he mean we repeated his word that's what he means and he wants to stand on if God I love how to public God said he said is the Lord told him go to the gravesite I think it was Abraham Lincoln or George Washington everyone he said go to the gravesite cuz I'm gonna wake him up hug he said go to the gravesite cuz I'm gonna wake him up he said the pastor said I call it leaves I'll call the television people I call everybody tell them yeah cuz God told me the resurrection touch that's how confident we should be in the Word of God we God speak to you just as deal hey oh ma that's where I want to be checked I want to beat your place rockin hear what the Spirit is saying and when God speak to me it don't matter what you see in my life I believe to God tell me to move you no matter what you think about me I'm gonna do what God's they do and let me say this if God telling you to do something he ain't gonna be off the word oh the books the Lord lead me to start my own church okay alright you stay with that and see how far I go old brother Lord lead me take a job well I can only come to church once a week once a month and did not at all that's my star you say God blessed me with this job that's a lot do because you making good money I don't mean God did its God give you anything it's going better your life they ain't gonna take away from your life see God's not an Indian giver holy God don't give you things and then take it away honey and if you allows you to leave something that means he's gonna give you something great holiday coz I remember I had an old you I like classic cars honey before before I got her Lita I mature stage I love old cars and my first car brother Brooks was a 73 cutlets whoa 73 cutlass supreme house truths on it haruya thick white walls he made some real rock rock on the back just know that role that I felt like I was an elevator just bad the next car hurry was a 69 Impala hardtop this is why you little man like me go cause I said because I'm driving the car that I'm driving me you know the nothing that I had a 79 Pontiac Bonneville a man follow hey man electric all the way to what a man just there's the steering wheel how you drop down and drop up oh yeah if you get the right one when I was worried those kind of people that little classic cars but you know God knew that was my joy so one day God let my joy get stolen one morning I woke up and my 79 was gone huh my sending now with the pretty wheels hurt nice tent windows the whole trip the hump roof with the gold buttons my jaw was gone now what I'm gonna do honey don't know I wanted to fight somebody I said who can scare for me I want to fight somebody but what God was trying to show me don't put your joy in material things I gotta join it nobody can steal I got a joy that came be replaced honey and allowed me to get I got over that I never dressed up a car again huh cuz I was hurt too bad I wasn't here you know sometimes things happen and you say I ain't gonna never let this happen again and a lot of times that's the wrong attitude because you ain't in control God is in control and what God was teaching me he was teaching me humility because it was all about me being seen I loved the heritage of glory and everybody checking me out when I ride down away but it came my name and I just do like this it can go ride self-glorification God say you know what this my son just my child but I'm gonna humble his behind I'm gonna humble his behind honey he liked to be seen so you know what happened my car got stolen and you know my dog I stole it I ain't got no car and the only car around that could be driven was a car that my brother was gonna get me a s10 Chevy pickup truck they had been hit by deer one thing you don't want you don't want God to have to Humble you he will do it but why God is giving you warning take the warning hurry stop to operate this different because God can bring you down so low make you feel like nothing but all he's doing this building you back up he building you back up right but that's what you had to do to me truck Church the trip got hit by deer the deer ran right into the driver side door so the whole day was smashed in some of the bed was smashed in the winner was bust out and this guy my my brother job was a tool and die maker so what he did he made a fiber glass window and drew a man's face on so for me to look out the door I had to open that face and look out the window like that he told me about being mean but I was God are you passing down his heritage of grace to me amen he was building me back up honey and one day I pull up to the light the stop sign and some of the guys on the job saw me and I heard them laughing from the Nick from it from I heard them laughing from the stop sign they were laughing so loud you know that made me do that made me fast and pray that made me go to God in prayer holy and sometimes we go through things in life because God is trying to get you to have a closer connection he's passing down Holly his heritage of faith things happen because God is trying to expose himself in a greater life Holly but sometimes because we wrote what we won't we misinterpret God's grace hallelujah you know church when I look right here I heard God told Abraham you're gonna have a son you have a child and then Sarah gets in the way says okay you and hey Tom get together cuz I'm too old we def just defecate him for me see she hadn't tapped into the heritage of face she hadn't tapped into it she was looking at our own human ability and God was not gonna get us by their ability it was gonna be by his Spirit says the whole holy wheel so he was trying to get them to move out of the way but if we look at this church holy if we look at the heaviest look at heritage look at this word amen heritage it means something that comes something that comes or belongs to one about reason a birth somebody say Amen test the God in you you were born with hallelujah you're born with like I said this morning when you were in the car you were born with the grace of God amen we are in it watch the stuff you impo to watch you were born with the grace of God that's give you his child now he'll hear amen the attributes of God they're already in us at birth sometimes I look at the pictures in your office and I look at your boss and I say boredom boss just like they did just like they did you couldn't deny that y'all was the last people worse you can you could you couldn't do like Abraham did he walk up there eliminate looking at his wife he's on I'm his brother I'm her brother you ain't ready to do that there wasn't no you a daddy I see you are Lyndon boys what happened that was the heritage of know Jesus honey hey yo geez inside them boys and whether they like it or not hey do but hey there's a pot o see inside of junior/senior just comes out of there like your daddy we move back your daddy you even talk like your daddy and then you can do better you inherit that huh that's my momma say sometimes we do stuff she say boy you act just like me you know we'd be in denial stage but it's passed down to you from birth that's why it's important to get the Holy Ghost because there are things in your family genes that will be passed down to you that you don't need that you don't want honey spiritual holy spiritual imperfections passed down from your God oh he told Abraham he said you're gonna have a seed but it's gonna come from your very own bowels hug so it's what I'm really saying when we think of our heritage who think of our lives we come from God this ain't just saying about the denomination and just poking the Bible and we say oh wait there's no I come from God it should have been more than saying amen you go you go and claim your natural brain stuckness I stated by Darwin now we're gonna come to the end I want something that's gonna make me live forever this faith I inherited it's gonna make me live for help you told Abraham is coming out of your own very own bowels and chance this God that we live for we come out of the very bowels of God the love of God come out of the bowels of God the faith of God come out of the bowels of God amen and if you don't believe that oh yeah apples produce apples anyway all just oranges grapes grapes Eagles Eagles Lions Lions and if all that is still producing like God created so should we go predict this more God let's look at the Heritage let's look at a little bit closer he says - I want you to catch the thais before I close he says to God he said hey the only one I got the pass down is just a leader of Damascus you know really reason when you do it when you dealing with a heritage it's like the reading of a will you know is being once what's left behind from that person who's no longer there but he's already put things in place for different people to get his prized possessions amen and at the rear of the wheel there's one person honey dividing everything and they call that person the power of attorney he has the power to give out everything that that person left behind but he's been instructed who to give it to hardly do you might walk the car but he didn't owe somebody else to get the car to that person you might want the house we didn't tell her to get a house - and the only one that has the power in starting to do is the power of attorney and Abraham said to God I don't want any either to be the power of attorney Hey he said he's I want him to be my heir he's the power of attorney and you know what brother Brennan with the power of attorney he was a power of attorney but what he was passing out he was passing out to us he's passing out the guards children honey he passed it out and now we're the recipients of it that's what I love about a wheel you know like I said I'm I'm from Carolina South Carolina you know just imagine the wheel was being reared up here one day brother H and this whole southern boy come up to come up to the willing of the wheel the reading of the wheel and you might look at me and all the other kids are sitting at the table and then there's a little illegitimate club daddy got a secret daddy got something I didn't nobody else don't know Bob but father and son has established a relationship so much of a relationship they meant that daddy said I don't know system brothers don't know you we don't get the same reward huh your name is gonna be written down on the document a man and some of us may have felt like we were illegitimate but we go steal something though and nobody can take that away then you look at you outside and all you want but your name is on the document oh yeah oh yeah my father made sure he left me an inheritance we might not have the same mama but we got the same daddy oh yeah and I'm gonna get what God has for me amen and you know your system Rose can dislike you they can look at y'all side I think he don't belong in this family ain't worried about that my name on the book talked about me as much as you please from the name on the book huh I come out of the same bowels of God holy and this heritage this appearances of faith has been passed down you know like I said brother he was the power of attorney he was there how are you giving us and you know that the deduction of this and adoption of that he was laying it all down because we were the only ones who could receive what the father was saying hallelujah but gee they got to a place to where God did what he said he was gonna do he told Abraham you're gonna have a son they took 25 years but he inherited what God said he was going in happy and that's what I want to get you today don't fall back on the promises of God whatever God has said in his word it shall come to pass you know I think I think of the prodigal son as I'm closing the prodigal he knew he had an inheritance a man church he knew he had an inheritance but he got a little too fast he got a little too fast he saw an accumulating maybe one day he walked in the room he saw his name his part of inheritance he said all that man why I gotta wait I won't mind right now so he went to his dad hey Dad I want everything I want my stuff not so dad I said okay you want it i'ma go ahead and give it to anger hold it back from you so daddy gave him his inheritance Church he went out there he wasted he wasted everything he had plenty of friends he was living it all up but why he was doing all that he couldn't enjoy how many people today hungry have left God they living in the world and their life is miserable cuz you can't enjoy you know why you can't enjoy because of where you come from huh y'all heritage real follow you who you are tell the god damn they gonna let you go easy then I imagine one day this boy was dying in a pigpen bodies from shock and then the real meaning of his heritage came to light all his money go he was thinking that was his inheritance but didn't click he said man my dad got service that lives better than us he said you know what I'm greater than a servant I'm a son so he's time to realize what his heritage was a church our had Jesus not the material things of this world our hands he says that we sons and daughters that's our heritage our heritage is that we're children of the king we were just holier not cause we can cast out the devil that we were taught cuz our name is written in heaven casting out demons just abolish hello and you can imagine earlier that father knew one day that son would really catch what it's inheritance is about all this money go and then one day what's the coincidence of that father standing out there that particular day and I saw that father knew one day was gonna click and a real father he's waiting on that child come to them sense come to their senses you may think he's hard you may think that he don't know what he talking about but all you want to do is see you catch it that's all you want to see he want to see you catch you inheritance honey catch it amen and once you catch it you realize your value that's what happened to that prodigal son he realized his value her his value what is natural money his value was his inheritance his name his family hug where he came from he realizes value and he went back home his father gave him a rock and put a ring on his feet he thought all his possessions was gone but God begins his father beginning to show him I got something greater for you then some money huh hey man I'm gonna put you in position just that's what it's about God is positionally placing us by faith hurry just faith that we're having hey man is that God may positionally place us so he could show the world that he's still living sutures the denominational world they couldn't tap into the heritage of faith they couldn't tap into it you know they said I'm about close don't get nervous they said you know we don't crucify you because of the good things you do we don't crucify for you we crucify you because you being a man say you God make yourself to be God Church they couldn't understand the heritage they couldn't understand he wasn't a man he was God for God I'm not a human being trying to be a child of God I'm at our God first living as a human being because my destiny is heaven and in heaven it ain't gonna be no human beings it will be God and his children God his children so he wouldn't I want you to catch this go see he was God first teenee became human remember he was born in a manger has the baby Jesus the god of glory had to learn how to walk a man he became a human being he was already gone God had to be real of breast milk God had his diaper change any man but he did that to show us holy that we can live abroad this flesh cuz we are God's first so tap into your heritage tap into the heritage of faith then what God has passed down to Abraham how many of us believed they were Abraham see if we believe with Abraham see that means we're royalty hallelujah because I ain't no Jew Hurley I'm a son of God honey I'm not tired I'm not tied down by skin color and I was created in the mind of God I was hurt my hair - Talia its abdomen inhale but Jesus honey was born in here let me he died and woke up in hell and everything around him we've - the Devils house tones of devil damu dad the kitchen ain't nobody eating the day bob lazar heroes he had all oh and what I love about God God I bless you and you don't even know your heritage look Peter was Peter was a cussing angry preacher cousin anger preaching and you know what before he manifested all that God gave him the keys to the kingdom - oh I got it for you i'ma give you the keys you will try to cut somebody hater my name it for no hilltop please ain't nobody that good I'm just gonna cut your ear off come on what no jujitsu and all that stuff back in them days tears I believe he was trying to cut a head off the God because hurry up Peter was a part of that heritage honey girl head to keep your slate cool huh cuz ain't nobody gonna be walking with Jesus with a track record cuz ain't gonna be no evidence there'll be no sign that you done it huh we don't be mad guilty you water with Jesus everything about you don't say not guilty not so heritage you got to repeat first of others hallelujah Amen because we inherit everything that God is by faith and you can receive of God today if you would just allow yourself to let God have this way let's stop trying to reason it out do it the way you want to do Church I mean I followed in that category too you know sometimes they're things that I want to do I didn't try to do bad and try to find me a job and do all kind of stuff I was just telling brother Bruce I started working with somebody and when I started working with them everything stopped breaking down trip stop bringing down people stop calling all the money stopped everything stop messing up and I realized I was Jonah to them people I realized is a good friend of mine I tell him I said go huh mean no harm but I say I understand I know what's going on I ain't supposed to be working with you so what I'm gonna do you go ahead friend that other part you ever trying to help me out you know I said you go ahead and sell it don't feel guilty because I knew God was telling me I don't want you off the field keep going this it's tough right now but keep going I got it under control you know sometimes things get tough and we try to fix it remember the song Jesus we're working baby need a parachute work it out like meals do some wave it up telephone disconnect write it up look for your next paycheck work it up turn it ain't up to you is up to him she touched when it comes to us when I want you to understand how many of us profess Jesus Christ as our Savior anybody you confess Jesus Christ as your Savior well I want you to know when you confess that that's in the atmosphere and you know when it comes to you his reputation is on the line honey so he gonna make sure you don't fail if he got the jack your life up worst thing about going the wrong way if God got to jack you up you in trouble it's like one of them old cowboy pictures you got a sign say wanted and bounding on the cone bounty hunting is the Holy Ghost darling gonna come say look here got to pistol out got all the bullies on the Bell say look at you wanted I got your picture there is a reward Eva you can come quietly or my pistol whip you or drag you behind this horse and that's what God will do you can either come cry me or you can get spiritually pissed it up and get dragged on your way but you go you gonna come if you gotta let your car get stolen you get humiliated hos you'll get sick in your body there was all kind of ways down we're gonna get me I had cancer my brain cuz God wanted to get my attention at the age of 15 yeah 15 years old and you know what he's still getting my attention Church the greatest thing I ever did in my life was when I repented when I said god I need you I can't do it on my own I still do that I still do I get I get along with God and I said lord I don't know what to do I need your help those are some of the best prayers honey when you can stop trying to do you know sometimes we we we would we take advice that we want to hear we go to people we know gonna favor us you know it's like it's like a husband garden told him I just put myself in God and told him to give me $1,000 God didn't told him man two birdies $1,000 and he quite don't want to do it so what'd he do he put it all on his wife no one she got things in the house she won't done and you showed us you know we got there we got that we need to do that we need you so yeah that's kind of what I thought I thought I wasn't supposed to do but God didn't tell him what to do now and he blaming it all on his wife we do that all the time God didn't told us what to do and we put it on someone we go back somebody garden told you already step into the heritage huh you can never go wrong trusting God huh but remember what I say amen whatever God is doing in your life it won't produce chaos if God is doing it it won't produce chaos because the Bible says God is not the author of confusion hilarya and if this producing confusion is not of God honey that's why sometimes I take a step back and I said lord I need you to direct me that don't mean for me to do nothing I mean for me to wait and let God open doors that God direct let God show me listen show me that that's what we need church that's the heritage of faith wind in Abraham get the Sun when he completely yielded and let himself lean on God that's when the Sun came when he didn't know no way out but he had to trust God that's when he got son Hurley so church let's trust God let's tap into this heritage of faith honey everything about God is in his supernatural seed and all we got to do is believe and walk into it still church is here let's pray musicians come let's pray I will turn the service over to brother Brooks Oh Lord we love you today and Lord we know that your word is true so we know that you cannot make mistakes Lord you don't fall short one of your ever-present help in the time of trouble you know prevention somebody's here tonight needing direction needing to hear from you their teachers how to wait to wait on you know that our stiffs may be renewed though we pray you bless this church Lord you blessed to hear us that hear the word of God and give understanding for we know that the enemy he waits on us to hear the word and don't seek out

confusion and and God is actually moving in it we thank God because it really blessed me today we're not gonna prolong the time but if there's anybody that needs prayer desire prayer you're more than welcome God is always in the healing and deliverance business we thank God for God being good to us had a good service down there this morning we ministered the service what we preached last Wednesday on escape to the City of Refuge there's only one hiding place for what's coming and no matter what the world may say they may try to scientific by it and say that make men think that they are in control but there's only one who's in control and that's God I like that illustration brother you know God has already told us hundreds of years ago what would be in this day and we have arrived we see it we are witness that this Bible is right thank God for His amazing grace well we have communion we're not gonna prolong the time seeing that there's no one that needs prayer I'm gonna ask brother [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's one there's no one is more like Jesus there's no one there's more ones that he I searched all around I found the one I turned all wrong

when he came to me there [Music] did my feet gave me glory call me when you reach down his head for me [Music] [Music] [Music] when you reach [Music] oh I'm so glad about it when you reach down easy for me I was reached Lord surely God is good to us as we stand let us take our scripture reading from first Corinthians the 11th chapter we'll begin reading by God's grace at the 23rd verse I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for us often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let us pray do you have any father God we so thank your father for your mercy and your grace such a wonderful Savior as we break this bread Lord we break it in your name and we pray father God that in so doing we will see the real meaning and real purpose behind it bless those who are sick and afflicted bless those who are cast down in spirit we pray father God that your word will excel above all problems in situations that we are faced with Lord we thank you for the work that has been done we give you honor we give you glory and we give you praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
