[32:52] thank him for allowing us to be here
[32:54] tonight
[32:56] this truly is the grace of god
[33:01] the more i think about uh what he
[33:04] has done for me in particular
[33:07] and i say us it does something on the
[33:11] inside
[33:13] words cannot express actually the
[33:15] gratitude that i have toward my savior
[33:19] and i am so thankful
[33:23] i'll say it again remember also my wife
[33:26] uh well she's just down there for
[33:30] a time that we're not sure when she's
[33:33] gonna return
[33:34] she's taking care of her mom and uh
[33:39] mom's blood pressure's getting better
[33:41] she's gaining weight

[33:47] doing
[33:49] she's counting the victory she's
[33:50] counting uh
[33:52] and claiming her healing and as long as

[33:55] she's claiming it we're going to claim
[33:57] it too no matter what it takes god knows
[34:00] what he's doing
[34:01] anyway let us turn to john 17.
[34:10] there's a lot of thoughts that that are
[34:12] uh this is cut off for something
[34:16] okay there's a lot of thoughts it's fine
[34:19] there's a lot of thoughts
[34:21] things i would like to say tonight we
[34:24] trust that god's perfect will be done
[34:27] give me the utterance to say what i need
[34:30] to say
[34:32] and like i said i love john 17 it's one
[34:35] of my
[34:36] favorite chapters in the bible because
[34:39] it
[34:39] basically shows me the relationship
[34:42] between my savior
[34:44] my god and uh revelation 17
[34:47] 23 i and them
[34:50] endow in me that they may be made
[34:54] perfect
[34:54] in one and that the world may know
[34:58] that thou has sent me and has loved
[35:01] them as thou has loved me father
[35:05] i will that they also whom thou has
[35:08] given me
[35:09] be with me where i am that they may
[35:12] behold my glory
[35:14] which thou has given me for thou loveth
[35:18] me
[35:18] before the foundation of the world
[35:23] that's scriptures of identification
[35:26] amen one more scripture uh passage
[35:30] matthew 10.
[35:32] uh try not to get a whole year too long
[35:35] here
[35:36] but uh we want to read this because
[35:39] i want to show something uh to you on at
[35:42] the end of the
[35:43] message the lord's willing if the lord
[35:46] leads me that way
[35:48] matthew 10 beginning at the 16th verse
[35:52] behold i send you forth as sheep in the
[35:55] midst of wolves
[35:57] be therefore wise as serpents
[36:00] and harmless as doves but beware of
[36:04] men for they will deliver you up to the
[36:07] council and they will scourge you
[36:10] in their synagogues ye shall be brought
[36:14] before governors and kings for my sake
[36:17] for testimony against them and the
[36:20] gentiles
[36:21] but when they deliver you up take no
[36:23] thoughts how or what ye should speak
[36:26] for it shall be given you in the same
[36:29] hour
[36:30] what ye shall speak for it is not ye
[36:33] that speak but the spirit of your father
[36:35] which speaketh in you
[36:37] i like that speaketh in you and
[36:40] the brothers shall deliver up brothers
[36:43] to death
[36:44] and the father the children and the
[36:46] children shall
[36:47] rise up against their parents and cause
[36:49] them to be put to death
[36:51] ye shall be hated of all men for my
[36:54] name's sake
[36:55] but he that endureth for the to the end
[36:57] shall be saved
[36:59] but when they persecute you in the city
[37:01] flee into another
[37:02] for verily i say unto you ye shall not
[37:05] have gone
[37:06] over the cities of israel till the son
[37:08] of man
[37:09] become ain't god good
[37:13] one more scripture please romans 9 22
[37:17] through 24
[37:21] 9 29
[37:24] excuse me 9 22-24
[37:30] if god willing to show his wrath
[37:34] and to make his power known endure with
[37:37] much long
[37:38] suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
[37:41] destruction
[37:43] and that he might make known the riches
[37:45] of his glory on the vessels of mercy
[37:48] which he have before prepared unto glory
[37:51] even us whom he have called
[37:55] not of the jews only but also of
[37:58] the gentiles let us pray
[38:02] father god we come before you lord jesus

[38:29] to us tonight and we'll be careful to
[38:31] give you the praise
[38:32] glory and honor in jesus christ's name
[38:35] we pray
[38:36] amen you may be seated
[38:47] we like to uh give a title to this
[38:50] message
[38:51] a higher order
[38:55] and we like a sub-topic
[38:59] our destiny the throne room
[39:04] we have been dealing with uh
[39:07] the end time message according to
[39:11] god's up the seals
[39:15] and uttering the seven thunders
[39:19] and i just want to make it clear tonight
[39:21] because
[39:22] it was that at that time when the
[39:26] church age changed up to that point
[39:30] brother branham was actually the seventh
[39:32] angel messenger to
[39:35] the seven church ages he
[39:39] uh was an eos malachi 4.
[39:44] uh revelation 10 7.
[39:47] we know that uh he also
[39:51] what is what we call uh a covenant angel
[39:55] in other words he dealt with two ages
[39:58] overlapping each other
[40:02] seventh church age as well as
[40:05] the bride age we call that
[40:08] the eternal age
[40:11] we have been taught by the prophet of
[40:15] god that
[40:17] what worked for luther
[40:21] will not work for wesley
[40:24] what worked with wesley
[40:29] would not work for the pentecostals
[40:33] and what worked for the pentecostals
[40:36] will not work for the broad age
[40:39] god always made turns
[40:43] he turned corners he's not building
[40:47] a wall he's building a building
[40:51] now for those of us who want to just
[40:53] remain in the seventh church age
[40:56] please feel free to do so
[40:59] but the bride of jesus christ
[41:02] she has one goal in her mind
[41:05] and understand she's the only one
[41:09] that can see the change and hear the
[41:12] change
[41:13] she's the only one that can receive the
[41:15] change
[41:16] everybody in luther's age could not
[41:19] receive what wesley preached everybody
[41:22] in wesley's age could not receive the
[41:25] pentecostal age
[41:27] so therefore everybody in the
[41:28] pentecostal age will not be able to
[41:30] receive the bride age uh we
[41:34] are at a place in time
[41:37] that god is doing such a mighty thing
[41:40] and we look at the chaotic the chaotic
[41:44] system that we're working with we
[41:47] understand
[41:48] by god's grace that we're at a time
[41:51] where
[41:51] the vassals of wrath seem to be
[41:55] controlling
[41:56] all things but understand these vessels
[42:00] is what the prophet god called cannon
[42:03] father
[42:04] they have been if i could say at the
[42:06] backdrop of the background
[42:09] of your glory because sometimes it takes
[42:12] the
[42:12] black tasper street of the night to show
[42:16] the glory of the stars
[42:18] and so god has allowed this chaotic time
[42:21] to
[42:22] to show that there is order
[42:25] even in satan's eden there is a light
[42:29] and lights that shine in the midst of
[42:33] all of this darkness and every light
[42:36] that shine has been predestinated to
[42:40] shine
[42:41] has been created by god
[42:44] to shine now the prophet god tells us
[42:48] that we are now living
[42:49] at the evening time the earthly body is
[42:53] now ready to be dissolved
[42:56] and we're preparing to enter into the
[42:59] heavenly
[43:00] and we now feel the strange call
[43:04] of god to go to this
[43:07] great eden now i don't know whether you
[43:09] feel it
[43:10] but i do there is a pull
[43:14] something moving on the inside that will
[43:17] not
[43:18] allow me to be satisfied
[43:21] in a condition of lukewarmness remember
[43:24] it was a lay of the sea and age that had
[43:27] fallen
[43:28] into lukewarmness i said this is the
[43:31] last time i minister
[43:32] the layers of sea and age or the spirit
[43:34] of laodicea
[43:36] is not a place or a thing it is
[43:37] condition
[43:39] and it's a condition where the people
[43:41] have left their first love
[43:43] and now they are in a lukewarm condition
[43:47] by way of the world and by way of the
[43:50] world
[43:51] and they're trying to hibery something
[43:53] amen to make it work but it cannot be
[43:56] worked
[43:56] but it cannot work god is calling
[44:00] for his bride uh to uh
[44:03] come to a total separation from all
[44:06] unbelief now we realize amen he says now
[44:11] and before we can be born here
[44:14] our little bodies cry out something
[44:17] that had to be provided or we be an
[44:20] afflicted child
[44:22] here if we wasn't god has no afflictions
[44:26] up there
[44:27] there everyone perfectly line up
[44:31] and the bride the bride just exactly
[44:33] like the groom was
[44:35] the word manifested in his season
[44:38] god granted tonight hallelujah
[44:41] children each and every one of you there
[44:44] is a heaven to go to
[44:46] and also there is a hell to stay
[44:50] away from you and i must understand that
[44:53] the work
[44:54] of that we're talking about is not human
[44:56] effort
[44:58] everything that we are experiencing is
[45:01] is because god quickens us
[45:04] that's what makes him so great uh you
[45:07] could be
[45:07] setting somewhere and and and maybe your
[45:10] mind is
[45:11] in a distance but when the holy ghost
[45:14] come he'll quicken you
[45:17] all right in other words he brings to
[45:18] life the seed
[45:20] that's in you by way of his presence
[45:23] and by way of his knowledge now notice
[45:27] when the great moving power of god comes
[45:29] into a son of god it quickens him
[45:34] hallelujah the spirit of life enters
[45:37] into him
[45:39] then what does he do it seats
[45:42] them in heavenly places right
[45:46] now so first of all we must understand
[45:50] if you have been quickened you are
[45:53] you are now sitting in heavenly places
[45:58] in christ jesus every man can't hear
[46:01] this message
[46:03] every christian can't see it
[46:06] that's why the book of revelation says
[46:08] blessed is a man that heareth and seeth
[46:11] you're blessed just being able to see
[46:14] that god has a message for this day and
[46:17] that this message
[46:18] is to prepare you for a translation
[46:22] hallelujah what we were getting in
[46:25] denominationalism and
[46:26] and in just in the seven church ages was
[46:29] not
[46:29] enough to translate us we needed
[46:33] him we needed the very person of the
[46:37] resurrection
[46:38] y'all understand what i'm saying because
[46:41] coming out of the system
[46:45] it's a it's a it's a in type
[46:48] a resurrection because you have been
[46:50] raised from the dead
[46:52] right and now you're living in another
[46:55] age we call eternal
[46:57] the bible tells us that when god
[46:59] quickens us
[47:01] immediately we are now setting
[47:05] in heavenly places right not tomorrow
[47:08] right now that's why the bible said ye
[47:11] are
[47:11] the sons of god now ye are the sons of
[47:15] god not tomorrow
[47:17] right but today whenever the birth takes
[47:20] place
[47:21] you are immediately a son of god
[47:25] or daughter of god but what happens
[47:28] we let the enemy take that away from us
[47:32] and we forget like james say
[47:35] we look into the mirror of the word and
[47:38] we forget what kind of
[47:39] man we ought to be hallelujah
[47:44] and it takes the word of god to do what
[47:46] the spirit of god
[47:47] to quicken you back to yourself
[47:50] is that right come on somebody that's
[47:52] why we repent every day
[47:55] that's why we ask god to forgive us
[47:56] every day because it is the quickening
[47:59] power
[48:00] that brings us back to our senses every
[48:02] time we fall
[48:03] every time we come short it is the
[48:05] quickening power
[48:06] that makes us confess and makes us make
[48:09] it right
[48:10] hallelujah it's not your ability
[48:13] it's god's grace hallelujah
[48:17] that's right it quickens him that spirit
[48:19] of life enters into him
[48:21] and it and it brings you into a heavenly
[48:23] place right
[48:25] we are now not we're already resurrected
[48:29] the dynamics and the mechanics is gone
[48:31] to the work
[48:32] quickening us and we're quickened up
[48:36] into the presence of god where his
[48:38] spirit is
[48:42] did you all hear what i said it says now
[48:44] we are already
[48:46] resurrected oh you say what do you mean
[48:50] i'm already there
[48:52] not that i'm trying to get there i'm
[48:54] already there
[48:56] there's a part of me that's there and
[48:58] there's a part of me that's here
[49:00] and one of these old days this part will
[49:03] meet that part
[49:04] and we'll be won hallelujah amen
[49:08] that's what jesus said he said the son
[49:10] of man how could he be in heaven
[49:13] and on earth at the same time you've
[49:15] heard me talk about
[49:16] relative relativity amen you've heard me
[49:20] how einstein was able to see that
[49:23] as a scientist being able to see that
[49:26] you can be in one place more than one
[49:28] place at
[49:29] at the same time hallelujah
[49:33] it is what it is now you you and i must
[49:36] understand that
[49:37] the word of god comes by faith
[49:42] hallelujah y'all heard about the little
[49:44] girl who
[49:45] was confronted by uh this old old man
[49:48] who thought he
[49:50] he had all uh the answer to her
[49:53] so-called problem uh when he questioned
[49:56] her and he asked her
[49:58] um you believe this bible and she says
[50:01] all of it
[50:03] and he says well you really believe that
[50:05] jonah was swallowed by a whale
[50:08] she says and he says how can you believe
[50:11] that
[50:12] other than by faith
[50:15] hallelujah she says i ask
[50:18] jonah when i get there
[50:23] and he says but what if jonah is not
[50:25] there she said then you ask him
[50:30] hallelujah and she basically shut him up
[50:33] with his reasoning
[50:35] because god said he he literally he
[50:38] created
[50:39] a special fish because he was trying to
[50:41] say
[50:42] you know the the well esophagus a throat
[50:45] is about that big
[50:46] how can god uh fit jonah through there
[50:49] god can do it if he wants to if he means
[50:51] he gotta shrink him and bring him back
[50:54] he can do whatever he wants to he's god
[50:57] like prophet god said if if the bible
[50:59] said jonah swallowed the well i believe
[51:01] it
[51:05] but i'm saying these things because i
[51:06] want you to understand that everything
[51:08] we preach tonight
[51:09] must be received by the faith of god
[51:13] that's in you that's in you now we are
[51:16] seated together in heavenly places in
[51:18] christ jesus in christ jesus setting in
[51:21] there
[51:22] see that great seat that's already
[51:25] fired up been raised from the dead
[51:29] we are part of it and if you are a part
[51:32] of the bride
[51:33] you are because the bride is not of the
[51:36] groom
[51:37] you know so we'll find out that it's the
[51:41] same thing
[51:42] and she'll do just exactly what's
[51:46] predicted for her to do in this day
[51:50] so we don't need to worry if you predict
[51:52] it if god has predestinated you
[51:54] as the bride of jesus christ you will do
[51:58] exactly what he says you say well what
[52:00] do you mean
[52:01] well just you don't want to do it
[52:05] or maybe you're like a jonah running
[52:08] from the presence of god
[52:10] see god has a way of of allowing you
[52:17] to fit into his plan
[52:21] hallelujah and it's not something that
[52:23] god has to scratch his head about
[52:25] because the fish was already prepared
[52:28] before jonah got into the water
[52:32] god knew what he was going to do god
[52:34] knows exactly what
[52:36] you know what we're all going to do what
[52:38] we're going to do
[52:39] and this is a beautiful thing about it
[52:42] god will give you the holy ghost
[52:43] knowing you're going to fall
[52:47] knowing there are times you'll do
[52:48] iniquity
[52:50] i said it knowing you'll do iniquity
[52:54] and yet he still gives us a holy ghost
[52:58] what is iniquity when you know to do
[53:00] good and do it that's not
[53:02] hallelujah you love the lord now we're
[53:05] talking about the throne room how in the
[53:07] world are you going to
[53:08] be part of that but jesus said you would
[53:13] he said if you overcome i'll grant you
[53:16] to sit in my throne even as
[53:18] i have sat in my father's throne
[53:21] now understand the throne in itself is
[53:23] figurative
[53:27] yeah how many of you you know you think
[53:29] you're going to have this big chair
[53:32] up there with a number that can't be
[53:34] number it's going to be sitting in this
[53:35] big chair
[53:37] no you sat in his throne room jesus said
[53:42] i've sat in my
[53:43] father's throne you've never seen jesus
[53:47] carrying a chair
[53:49] no he was talking about their position
[53:52] of authority
[53:54] you will have the authority as i even
[53:57] had the authority
[53:59] hallelujah is that right that's why he
[54:01] said in saint john
[54:03] father i would there be one even as we
[54:05] are one
[54:07] hallelujah is that right and the day
[54:10] jesus was
[54:11] on the time that jesus resurrected from
[54:13] the dead he said
[54:15] all power in heaven and earth is given
[54:17] unto me
[54:22] think about it is that right brother
[54:24] branham see people when you start saying
[54:25] figuratively
[54:27] people think well what are you saying
[54:28] well brother random preached a message
[54:30] revelation is the book of symbols
[54:33] a lot of things are symbolic right like
[54:36] i said you're not going to see jesus up
[54:38] there
[54:38] flipping pages because of the book of
[54:41] life
[54:44] hello he is the book
[54:47] he is the bread he is the book
[54:53] is that right in the beginning was the
[54:55] word the word was with god and the word
[54:57] was god
[54:59] hallelujah and in order to be in the
[55:01] book
[55:02] you have had to be a part of his
[55:04] attributes
[55:05] from the foundation of the world
[55:07] hallelujah
[55:08] before time began you had to be there
[55:12] before god even said let there be light
[55:15] you had to have been there
[55:17] because god is a spirit and god god
[55:20] god was breaking forth and unfolding
[55:22] himself by way of his attributes
[55:25] you know he didn't become god until he
[55:27] created angels
[55:28] because god the word god means to
[55:32] to worship and if there was no angels or
[55:35] anything to worship him he was not yet
[55:37] god
[55:37] but he was also elohim god the existing
[55:41] one
[55:42] hallelujah and don't you know even
[55:44] though he created
[55:45] angels he still was not yet a father
[55:48] he had to have children in order to be a
[55:52] father
[55:53] so god comes down and he unfolds himself
[55:56] like i said the other day
[55:57] and then elohim then from elohim came
[56:00] the word
[56:01] right the word began but you see the
[56:04] word in itself became flesh
[56:06] that was another unfolding of god
[56:09] hallelujah why you say that because
[56:12] jesus said when you see me
[56:14] you have seen the father hallelujah that
[56:17] means
[56:17] god amen the unv invisible god who could
[56:21] not be seen
[56:21] all of a sudden he formed himself into
[56:23] the logo he spoke
[56:25] and the logos came we call that
[56:29] a birth hallelujah that's what we call
[56:33] the sun
[56:34] you understand me not the s-u-n the
[56:37] s-o-n
[56:38] and from that son amen was the beginning
[56:42] of god's creation
[56:45] hallelujah what was it god amen in his
[56:48] infinite wisdom amen sought amen to
[56:52] create himself
[56:53] a human fleshly body
[56:56] to live in so he could fellowship
[57:00] with his creation that's what made
[57:03] the mystery of god so beautiful in the
[57:05] book of genesis
[57:07] because here was adam and the bible said
[57:09] god made him male and female
[57:12] hallelujah now we've seen the male part
[57:16] hallelujah but now it's time to see the
[57:18] female part
[57:20] hallelujah and just like god cut open
[57:23] amen the first adam sighed and brought
[57:26] out bone
[57:27] and that was eve we call her e because
[57:31] she fell but
[57:32] her actual name was adam she bought the
[57:35] very name
[57:36] of her husband hallelujah and so
[57:40] god comes along and he cuts jesus's
[57:43] side by a roman spear
[57:47] he allow it to happen and out come who
[57:50] miss jesus christ
[57:54] but it has taken seven days
[57:59] six days however you want to but my
[58:02] point is
[58:02] in the process of the church ages he had
[58:05] been forming
[58:07] the bride of jesus christ
[58:10] hallelujah and that's why this is
[58:13] important
[58:14] you need to know what part of the body
[58:19] you are
[58:22] somebody help me here
[58:26] see we're living and i'll come back to
[58:28] that in a moment we're in
[58:29] in in the last days there is not another
[58:32] church age that will come after us
[58:36] and when the prophet god was here
[58:38] actually the lay of the syrian age was
[58:40] the very last call
[58:42] he said this is the last warning there
[58:45] will
[58:46] not be another the throne room has been
[58:49] set up the 12 foundations has been laid
[58:53] the streets of gold have been paved the
[58:56] gates of gigantic pearls are raised and
[58:59] hanged
[59:00] like a pyramid she stands so fair and
[59:03] glorious
[59:04] the heavenly being who have prepared her
[59:07] watched
[59:08] breathlessly god was having fun
[59:13] breathlessly yes
[59:16] amen uh uh uh and he's working is out
[59:20] for she glistens and shines
[59:24] with the story of amazing grace in jesus
[59:27] love see that's why i say every stone in
[59:30] the city
[59:32] has a testimony somebody help me here
[59:35] every stone when john says behold the
[59:39] lamb's wife
[59:41] and that new jerusalem comes down
[59:43] glistening
[59:45] with the glory of god and every one of
[59:48] those stones represents somebody's
[59:50] testimony
[59:52] hallelujah for she glistens and shines
[59:56] with the glory
[59:57] that is unearthly every facet of her
[1:00:00] beauty
[1:00:01] tells a story of amazing grace and jesus
[1:00:05] is love
[1:00:06] she is a city prepared for a pair of
[1:00:09] prepared people
[1:00:10] she awaits only for her inhabitants
[1:00:14] and soon they were thrown her streets
[1:00:18] with joy the city
[1:00:21] you know the city awaits me
[1:00:25] hallelujah i wish you the inhabitants
[1:00:27] it's it's waiting on us he says it's
[1:00:29] done it's finished
[1:00:30] and it's waiting on us
[1:00:34] see god didn't like us you know finishes
[1:00:36] up everything at the last minute
[1:00:40] he's he's got it already prepared y'all
[1:00:42] hear what i'm saying
[1:00:43] and now the city is waiting on who
[1:00:46] the redeemed the bride of jesus christ
[1:00:50] but we've got just a little bit more
[1:00:52] work to do
[1:00:54] hallelujah we must put the devil under
[1:00:57] our feet
[1:00:59] hallelujah we do not leave out of here
[1:01:01] as fair yes
[1:01:02] we leave out of here as conquerors even
[1:01:06] so paul said
[1:01:07] we're more than conquerors hallelujah
[1:01:12] yes it's the last call the spirit will
[1:01:16] not speak
[1:01:17] in another age the ages
[1:01:20] are over hallelujah
[1:01:24] that's the leadership church age is that
[1:01:26] all right
[1:01:28] let's read revelation the third chapter
[1:01:30] i've quoted it a little bit already
[1:01:32] 21st through the 22nd uh verses
[1:01:36] and it reads to him that overcometh
[1:01:39] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:01:44] even i i also overcame
[1:01:47] and am set down with my father in his
[1:01:50] throne
[1:01:51] now god didn't let jesus christ bypass
[1:01:54] nothing he had to overcome
[1:01:58] i think about it sometimes when they
[1:02:01] slapped him in the face when they sped
[1:02:02] on him
[1:02:03] and the bible said he he didn't open his
[1:02:06] mouth
[1:02:07] he could not because the scripture said
[1:02:09] he would not
[1:02:11] he was a lamb led to the slaughter
[1:02:15] can god lead you as a lamb to the
[1:02:17] slaughter
[1:02:19] hallelujah yeah he said what's been done
[1:02:21] in the green shall also be done in the
[1:02:23] drive
[1:02:24] hallelujah there's a persecution coming
[1:02:27] there's a pressure coming
[1:02:28] and god is is expecting us
[1:02:31] to overcome hallelujah how
[1:02:35] with me sweetness and meekness
[1:02:39] oh we don't pick up a sword like like
[1:02:41] like uh
[1:02:42] our brother did peter hallelujah
[1:02:45] we're not here to fight with the natural
[1:02:47] things our weapon
[1:02:50] and our warfare is spiritual
[1:02:54] not carnal spiritual
[1:02:57] guess where the sword is in your mouth
[1:03:02] he that have an ear let him hear what
[1:03:05] the spirits say to the church
[1:03:07] now the prophet god now understand that
[1:03:09] this message is given to a
[1:03:11] special class of people
[1:03:14] everybody can't get it and when the
[1:03:16] devil tells you you ain't nothing tell
[1:03:18] him i'm sorry
[1:03:19] god has already called me special hey
[1:03:23] god called me special y'all understand
[1:03:26] me
[1:03:27] i didn't get those words are not mine
[1:03:29] those words are years
[1:03:31] i receive that i'm a special
[1:03:34] i'm a special class of people hallelujah
[1:03:38] let me tell you something god will work
[1:03:40] with you individually every day if you
[1:03:42] allow him to
[1:03:43] i've seen god do things that i guess i
[1:03:45] don't feel like i don't i don't need to
[1:03:47] tell you but
[1:03:47] i can tell you something a lot of times
[1:03:49] people think well we're waiting on the
[1:03:50] third pool hello
[1:03:52] the third pool is here
[1:03:56] you're a part of it
[1:04:02] oh my god you're a part of it what are
[1:04:04] we waiting on
[1:04:08] what was the sign to lao to see a church
[1:04:10] agent
[1:04:11] you know what the sign was a prophet
[1:04:15] did y'all know that that was a
[1:04:18] the sign to the laodicean age was a
[1:04:22] prophet
[1:04:24] whenever you see a prophet first of all
[1:04:26] he comes to straighten you out
[1:04:29] he comes amen with judgment
[1:04:32] right every time
[1:04:36] israel had a prophet it came god brought
[1:04:39] him to bring them out of something
[1:04:41] and take him into something for example
[1:04:45] moses brought him out of egypt and the
[1:04:48] intent was to take him into
[1:04:50] the promised land is that right no it
[1:04:53] took him out of the anteluvian
[1:04:55] world and brought him into a new world
[1:04:58] but before he could bring him into
[1:05:00] judgment had to strike hallelujah
[1:05:04] 1962 judgment struck the west coast
[1:05:10] and now we're seeing it rumbling and
[1:05:12] thundering
[1:05:13] our way and basically it's hitting the
[1:05:16] world at large
[1:05:18] right because when it left the west
[1:05:20] coast it headed back to the east
[1:05:23] hallelujah and now you see earthquakes
[1:05:26] famines pestilence floods
[1:05:30] hurricanes you name it every natural
[1:05:33] disaster
[1:05:34] that can possibly hit the earth is now
[1:05:37] hitting the earth
[1:05:38] and even china right now is suffering
[1:05:43] see you say well what do you mean god
[1:05:46] will raise up a man
[1:05:48] as judgment to the church put pressure
[1:05:52] on them
[1:05:52] put some persecution on them and then
[1:05:54] after god uses that man
[1:05:56] he's a vessel of dishonor never believed
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:00] never received god and god does what he
[1:06:02] wants to do with him afterwards
[1:06:04] he said you can recall that i mentioned
[1:06:06] at the beginning of this message that
[1:06:08] this book
[1:06:09] we are studying is the actual revelation
[1:06:11] of jesus himself
[1:06:13] in the church and his work in the future
[1:06:16] ages
[1:06:18] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:06:20] spirit to give us revelation or we will
[1:06:23] fail to get it
[1:06:25] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:06:27] will see that it won't take just
[1:06:29] ordinary study and thinking to make the
[1:06:32] this
[1:06:33] book real it is going to take the
[1:06:36] operation of the holy ghost
[1:06:38] that means this book can't be revealed
[1:06:41] to anyone
[1:06:42] but a special class of people it will
[1:06:44] take
[1:06:45] one with a prophetic insight and it
[1:06:48] requires the ability
[1:06:49] to hear from god it will require
[1:06:53] supernatural instructions not just a
[1:06:56] student
[1:06:56] comparing verse with verse though that
[1:06:59] is good
[1:07:00] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[1:07:03] the spirit
[1:07:04] or it never becomes clear this is what
[1:07:06] i'm saying
[1:07:08] and yet the churches want to get rid of
[1:07:09] the holy ghost
[1:07:11] we need it because no matter how much i
[1:07:14] preach from here
[1:07:15] if the holy ghost do not anoint your
[1:07:17] heart and ears
[1:07:18] you won't be able to see what i'm trying
[1:07:20] to say that's why so many people walk
[1:07:23] out
[1:07:23] and don't come back to the next week
[1:07:27] because the bible has this word come
[1:07:30] together
[1:07:31] when you see that day approaching come
[1:07:33] together the more
[1:07:34] i'm still looking for the more yet
[1:07:38] more people in the church i'm still
[1:07:40] looking
[1:07:42] amen because they're not getting it
[1:07:45] and the reason why is because they don't
[1:07:47] see the season they're living in
[1:07:51] hello let me tell you something there's
[1:07:53] been an exodus already out of
[1:07:55] denominationalism organizationalism
[1:07:58] hallelujah and we're part of that huh
[1:08:01] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:08:03] and why did we come out of that because
[1:08:05] we heard his voice
[1:08:07] come out of her my people be not
[1:08:09] partakers of her sin
[1:08:11] hallelujah is that right
[1:08:14] oh yes i had a very supernatural
[1:08:18] experience with that when i was in the
[1:08:19] organization amen i was up on the choir
[1:08:22] singing i forgot what song we were
[1:08:24] singing
[1:08:24] i mean the power of god was in the place
[1:08:27] i heard
[1:08:29] come out of her my people and be not
[1:08:32] partakers of her sin
[1:08:34] people i didn't even know that was in
[1:08:35] the book of revelation
[1:08:37] we worked hard not to read the book of
[1:08:39] revelation
[1:08:42] and to my discovery we find out that
[1:08:44] it's in the book of revelation
[1:08:46] god spoke to me now you don't have to
[1:08:48] believe that but he did
[1:08:49] and guess what i came out
[1:08:54] god who in sunday at times and in davis
[1:08:57] man of spake and time pass unto the
[1:09:00] fathers by the prophets
[1:09:01] and it may look like i'm trying i'm
[1:09:03] trying to get
[1:09:04] take her somewhere just bear with me and
[1:09:07] have in these last days spoken
[1:09:09] unto us by his son whom he have
[1:09:11] appointed heir of all things
[1:09:13] by whom also he made the world and i
[1:09:16] apologize as hebrew the first chapter
[1:09:18] one through three who being the
[1:09:21] brightness of his glory
[1:09:25] hallelujah and the expressed image
[1:09:29] of his person
[1:09:33] and up holding all things by the word of
[1:09:35] his power
[1:09:36] when he had by himself purged our sins
[1:09:40] set down on the right hand of the
[1:09:42] majesty
[1:09:43] on eye hallelujah do you mind if i
[1:09:47] read the uh amplified just for a little
[1:09:50] bit
[1:09:51] in many separations in many separate
[1:09:54] revelations
[1:09:56] each of which set forth a portion of the
[1:09:59] truth
[1:10:00] and in different ways god spoke of oh
[1:10:04] to our forefathers and in and by the
[1:10:07] prophets
[1:10:08] i like that different ways he unfolded
[1:10:11] himself
[1:10:13] jehovah jireh jehovah nisi
[1:10:16] jehovah shalom different ways he
[1:10:19] he broke it open by way of the prophets
[1:10:22] revealing himself now remember
[1:10:25] it was israel's business to know the
[1:10:28] father it was the gentiles business
[1:10:31] to know the son in the holy spirit the
[1:10:34] bride's business
[1:10:35] to know the holy spirit y'all hear what
[1:10:37] i'm saying this is why
[1:10:39] uh a layer of seer spirit was able to do
[1:10:44] the church by saying that the
[1:10:47] evidence of the holy ghost is speaking
[1:10:51] in tongues
[1:10:52] it doesn't mean that the holy ghost
[1:10:53] doesn't speak in tongues but it's not
[1:10:55] the evidence
[1:10:57] that means every time i see somebody
[1:10:59] speaking in tongues
[1:11:00] that's the that's the holy ghost not so
[1:11:03] not so amen the tongues is a
[1:11:07] is a gift of god matter of fact
[1:11:09] according to paul it is the least
[1:11:11] of the gifts but the bride knows that
[1:11:15] hallelujah she understand the difference
[1:11:19] between
[1:11:20] the the the counterfeit and the real one
[1:11:23] because the real holy ghost brings about
[1:11:26] a change
[1:11:28] hallelujah you can say i got the holy
[1:11:30] ghost all you want to and they haven't
[1:11:32] been a change in your life
[1:11:34] something's wrong hallelujah and i'm not
[1:11:37] saying you ain't got it maybe you just
[1:11:39] got it on your spirit on your flesh
[1:11:41] and you haven't allowed to break a birth
[1:11:42] in your soul
[1:11:44] now get me right being that we are bride
[1:11:48] doesn't mean
[1:11:49] that we become sin free or sin less
[1:11:53] hallelujah the bible said if you say you
[1:11:55] have not sinned then you make him a liar
[1:11:58] but we understand that our sin freedness
[1:12:01] if you want to say it
[1:12:02] comes by his justification he justifies
[1:12:06] us
[1:12:06] hallelujah that's what makes the
[1:12:08] difference y'all understand me
[1:12:10] he sanctify us that's what makes the
[1:12:13] difference
[1:12:14] your flesh will never be sanctified
[1:12:17] until god
[1:12:17] changes it and that is at the coming of
[1:12:20] the lord
[1:12:21] hallelujah but in the last days
[1:12:24] he has spoken to us in the person of a
[1:12:28] son
[1:12:29] whom he appointed heir and lawful owner
[1:12:32] of all things also by and through whom
[1:12:36] he created the worlds and re and the
[1:12:39] in the and the reaches of space and the
[1:12:41] age of time
[1:12:43] he made produced built operated
[1:12:46] arranged them in order in other words he
[1:12:49] did it all
[1:12:51] the same god is that right in the
[1:12:54] beginning was a word
[1:12:54] the word was with god the word was god
[1:12:56] the bible tells us that everything that
[1:12:59] was made
[1:13:00] was made by him
[1:13:03] hallelujah amen
[1:13:07] hallelujah
[1:13:11] one thing about signs
[1:13:14] jesus christ even gave john a sign
[1:13:20] to identify him because always a sign
[1:13:22] come before the voice
[1:13:25] and john had already been told that this
[1:13:28] would be jesus christ
[1:13:30] the one you see the dove descending
[1:13:34] now mind you though there were other
[1:13:35] people around john
[1:13:38] they did not see the dove descending
[1:13:40] they didn't see the light is that right
[1:13:43] remember the voice of god is given to
[1:13:46] the elected
[1:13:48] even when paul fell from his horse
[1:13:51] called saul
[1:13:52] amen paul heard the voice of god
[1:13:55] and those around him only heard thunder
[1:13:59] hallelujah and that's how it is in the
[1:14:01] message there are those who have heard
[1:14:03] thunder but they have not heard the
[1:14:05] voice
[1:14:07] in other words the book becomes sealed
[1:14:09] still yet
[1:14:10] until we can hear the voice y'all hear
[1:14:13] what i'm saying
[1:14:14] the voice must speak can i say it like
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:18] the vision must speak and when the
[1:14:21] vision speaks
[1:14:22] it becomes plain to the man who can hear
[1:14:26] hallelujah you know god wise god is a
[1:14:30] god of wisdom
[1:14:31] he said he have hidden it hidden these
[1:14:33] revelations from the wise and the
[1:14:35] prudent
[1:14:36] hallelujah if you feel like you're
[1:14:38] nobody you're the one god wants to use
[1:14:41] you're the one god wants to reveal this
[1:14:42] word to you because see you don't see
[1:14:44] feel like you're too mighty
[1:14:46] you're not so great you understand that
[1:14:49] everything that i
[1:14:50] have come by the grace of god
[1:14:54] and i'm explaining to you what i mean by
[1:14:56] hearing
[1:14:59] because you know you and i we we
[1:15:01] understand the
[1:15:02] the seven seals and the seven thunders
[1:15:05] how it
[1:15:05] brother battle began to break the word
[1:15:07] open to us
[1:15:10] but the saddest part about this is that
[1:15:12] when that
[1:15:13] cloud appeared in 1963 and i meant to
[1:15:16] bring my book but that's okay
[1:15:18] we failed to see that something changed
[1:15:23] remember i said that also that brother
[1:15:25] branham before
[1:15:26] 63 he was an angel would come to him
[1:15:31] he see visions not meaning that these
[1:15:34] things stopped
[1:15:36] but something changed
[1:15:39] when that sword hit his hand something
[1:15:42] changed
[1:15:43] that was when god recognized him
[1:15:46] as a matured son of god
[1:15:50] literally giving him the king's sword
[1:15:54] and then brother branham likens the
[1:15:55] king's sword to the seven thunders
[1:15:58] the opening of the word the third pull
[1:16:03] go go read that's what he said
[1:16:07] and if that king's sword listen it goes
[1:16:10] right back to the word
[1:16:11] because that's what the king sword was
[1:16:14] the reveal word
[1:16:16] for the hour hallelujah and
[1:16:19] each and every one of us has to eat the
[1:16:21] book
[1:16:23] because the prophet god said we were a
[1:16:24] type of john
[1:16:27] y'all understood me john was a type of
[1:16:30] the bride
[1:16:31] so you got to eat the book
[1:16:34] what book the very words that
[1:16:39] he has spoken since then
[1:16:43] not just you say what do you mean i mean
[1:16:44] for your day
[1:16:46] i'm losing somebody because you're not
[1:16:48] you're not following me don't worry
[1:16:49] about your theology right now just
[1:16:51] listen to
[1:16:52] if god got me here as a minister listen
[1:16:54] to what i'm trying to tell you
[1:16:55] stop blocking what i'm trying to say
[1:17:00] because you and i must understand the
[1:17:02] life of christ
[1:17:04] must feel you and how on earth are you
[1:17:08] going to know
[1:17:09] what is required for you if you don't
[1:17:12] know your position
[1:17:14] i got quotes to back me up on that
[1:17:17] you got to understand there's a position
[1:17:19] the bride must take and maintain
[1:17:24] hallelujah we must come to a place
[1:17:29] where jesus himself will say
[1:17:33] that he's pleased to dwell in us
[1:17:38] is that right father would there be one
[1:17:40] even as we are one
[1:17:42] what was it as i said the last minute
[1:17:45] time
[1:17:46] the flesh in itself still
[1:17:49] has to be redeemed
[1:17:52] but that's the part god came to redeem
[1:17:55] it was the soul as well
[1:17:57] but the soul in the spirit has already
[1:17:58] been redeemed
[1:18:00] it is your flesh that god wants that was
[1:18:03] that third
[1:18:04] that was that part of god that that that
[1:18:07] fell
[1:18:08] right come on y'all
[1:18:13] where's the high breeding it ain't in
[1:18:16] your soul
[1:18:17] it's in your flesh why don't you have
[1:18:21] control
[1:18:23] what made it so that you felt you you
[1:18:25] liked the control of your flesh
[1:18:27] because when satan gained control of the
[1:18:30] earth
[1:18:31] he gained control of your flesh because
[1:18:34] your flesh came from his earth the dust
[1:18:36] of the earth
[1:18:38] and therefore he has been ruling this
[1:18:40] flesh for
[1:18:41] 2 000 or 6 000
[1:18:44] and it took jesus christ to come redeem
[1:18:47] back the body
[1:18:49] hallelujah to wit god was in christ
[1:18:52] hallelujah with the redemption of your
[1:18:54] body
[1:18:55] to witness the redemption of your body
[1:19:01] this is what god comes to do
[1:19:06] to redeem your body that's why you fight
[1:19:08] with it every day
[1:19:10] and paul says kill it
[1:19:13] don't dwell with the inhabitants come on
[1:19:17] somebody is that right
[1:19:18] that was part of the promised land y'all
[1:19:21] know that right
[1:19:22] joshua was a part of the holy the
[1:19:25] promised land he went into the prophecy
[1:19:27] they they over the uh uh jordan
[1:19:31] which means death comes over there and
[1:19:34] and now
[1:19:34] you've got to die in this land and while
[1:19:37] you're dying
[1:19:38] you got to conquer so what do you mean
[1:19:40] die you got to die to your will
[1:19:43] those 10 spies came back with their own
[1:19:45] will
[1:19:46] instead of submitting to the will of god
[1:19:49] they came back with a false report
[1:19:53] and until you relinquish your will and
[1:19:55] give it to god
[1:19:56] you're going to always come back with a
[1:19:58] false report god i can't do it
[1:20:01] when god says you can greater is he that
[1:20:04] is in you
[1:20:05] than he that is in the world hallelujah
[1:20:08] paul said we're more than conquerors
[1:20:10] through christ jesus
[1:20:11] we're able to take the land is that
[1:20:13] right that's what brother brahma said he
[1:20:15] said joshua
[1:20:16] you know parallels ephesians and
[1:20:19] ephesians is there
[1:20:20] amen telling us to take the land know
[1:20:23] who you
[1:20:24] are know what you are this is what this
[1:20:27] message came
[1:20:28] to do right remember
[1:20:31] it was god who called you out of
[1:20:33] laodicea
[1:20:34] hallelujah that means he's chosen you to
[1:20:37] be bride
[1:20:39] somebody help me here he's chosen you
[1:20:42] to be bride you've heard his voice you
[1:20:45] came
[1:20:46] out and let god do the work now
[1:20:50] hallelujah right and i'm saying all of
[1:20:53] this because
[1:20:54] so many people down the cloud if you
[1:20:55] down the cloud get rid of the cloud
[1:20:57] you've gotten rid of the message of the
[1:20:59] eighth day
[1:21:00] you've gotten rid of amen the age the
[1:21:03] self the eternal age you
[1:21:05] you've gotten rid of the word that gonna
[1:21:07] bring you to a perfection
[1:21:08] you have gotten rid of the word that's
[1:21:10] gonna bring the invisible union
[1:21:19] you say brother books that ain't no
[1:21:22] brother ben was doing something great
[1:21:23] he said you cannot teach supernatural
[1:21:25] things to pentecostal babies
[1:21:28] what was he talking about he was talking
[1:21:30] about the age of pentecost
[1:21:32] pentecostal babies they didn't grow no
[1:21:34] no better no bigger
[1:21:36] no larger no they never matured ever
[1:21:40] remain babies because they fail
[1:21:43] to eat the word that was given to them
[1:21:48] and because of that hello is that right
[1:21:51] revelation the third chapter
[1:21:53] jesus christ is outside of the church
[1:21:56] age
[1:21:57] knocking trying to get back in
[1:22:01] because what the lay of the sins put
[1:22:03] them out
[1:22:04] this age that we're dealing with look at
[1:22:06] look at look at the apostasy
[1:22:09] they don't even know right from wrong
[1:22:10] anymore
[1:22:12] hallelujah things that they would not
[1:22:14] allow they allow now
[1:22:16] what god knows it's amazing grace and
[1:22:19] god is love where the bible tells me not
[1:22:21] only is he love but he's a consuming
[1:22:22] fire
[1:22:24] he's a god of judgment they don't want
[1:22:27] to preach judgment
[1:22:28] you preach judgment they're going to put
[1:22:29] you out oh that's too hard
[1:22:32] not for a true son and daughter of god
[1:22:34] bring it on
[1:22:36] correct me now hallelujah let me get
[1:22:39] sanctified now let me get filled with
[1:22:41] the holy ghost now
[1:22:42] let me move on up i need his correction
[1:22:48] so so you can understand
[1:22:52] what did god do he tells us that in the
[1:22:55] scriptures
[1:22:56] we'll see him face to face
[1:23:02] and the only thing i know of is that
[1:23:04] when i look in the mirror i look in the
[1:23:06] mirror and i see
[1:23:07] face to face
[1:23:10] coming into the very image and likeness
[1:23:13] of god
[1:23:14] by looking into the mirror of the word
[1:23:17] hallelujah that you are so covered with
[1:23:20] the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:21] that only the only face god can see is
[1:23:25] the face of jesus christ
[1:23:28] hallelujah you understand me why was the
[1:23:31] prophet caught up into the head
[1:23:34] what was it that he was getting from the
[1:23:36] head he wasn't caught up into the
[1:23:38] eyes he was caught up into the mind of
[1:23:41] god
[1:23:42] that's where it was hidden because no no
[1:23:45] man
[1:23:45] nor no angel knew
[1:23:48] what was there
[1:23:54] and at that point in time god began to
[1:23:56] unfold to the prophet god
[1:23:58] even when he came from that experience
[1:24:01] what was what was god doing that was a
[1:24:02] sign
[1:24:04] that was the beginning of his coming
[1:24:06] back
[1:24:09] is that right because he told them he
[1:24:11] says in like manna
[1:24:12] when jesus began to resurrect when he
[1:24:14] rose from
[1:24:16] after talking with the disciples the
[1:24:17] bible said that he was received up into
[1:24:20] the clouds
[1:24:21] he said what you gazing at what you
[1:24:24] looking at
[1:24:24] i'm going to come again in like manner
[1:24:28] and he did but that's the beginning
[1:24:31] not the ending but
[1:24:35] that was a sign to you that he didn't
[1:24:37] forget about you
[1:24:39] that was a sign to you it's time to move
[1:24:43] the mighty ages on the move hallelujah
[1:24:46] he's now got you out and he's seeking
[1:24:50] his bride among the ones that did come
[1:24:53] out
[1:24:54] hallelujah no egg cans are in this
[1:25:00] no he can't he says now science
[1:25:04] took the picture of it you've seen it
[1:25:06] went on
[1:25:07] associated press they didn't know what
[1:25:09] it was
[1:25:10] there's a cloud hanging 26 miles high
[1:25:13] that 15 miles or 20 above even where
[1:25:17] vapor is at they don't know
[1:25:20] what it is what it's all going about
[1:25:23] and they are trying to investigate it
[1:25:25] and there right under it
[1:25:27] i was standing and those seven angels
[1:25:31] roaring out their voices hello
[1:25:34] roaring out their voices
[1:25:37] of those seven seals standing there and
[1:25:40] to witness
[1:25:41] three of us as a witness of the things
[1:25:44] that were
[1:25:45] prophesied on this tape sir what is the
[1:25:48] time
[1:25:49] and there now there you're listen look
[1:25:51] how down the road we are over 50 years
[1:25:53] since this been happening
[1:25:54] and we're now waking up why he said that
[1:25:57] the message was ahead of everything
[1:26:01] history has to catch up somebody it's
[1:26:04] the truth
[1:26:05] we have to that's why god holding it is
[1:26:08] that right
[1:26:08] they were on their road to emmaus
[1:26:12] and jesus was preaching to him and he
[1:26:14] held their eyes
[1:26:17] to they could not see who he was until
[1:26:20] he broke the bread
[1:26:23] hello and god is holding our eyes
[1:26:26] on a lot of things but now something
[1:26:28] moved i'm trying to tell you
[1:26:30] something is moving and the bride of
[1:26:33] jesus christ is going to get it
[1:26:36] you've been ordained to get it
[1:26:38] hallelujah
[1:26:39] i ain't trying to put no fear in you i'm
[1:26:41] not even trying to think you think
[1:26:42] you're going to
[1:26:42] you got to do this and do that the bible
[1:26:45] says not by power not by might but by my
[1:26:47] holy spirit
[1:26:48] it is god it's not him who will it
[1:26:51] though he that run it but it's god who
[1:26:52] shows mercy
[1:26:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:58] scientists knows it's everything that's
[1:27:00] why i try to tell people i said these
[1:27:02] these people who stood around this
[1:27:03] message all years 30 years
[1:27:05] 40 years amen and now they they get
[1:27:08] they've gone
[1:27:09] why because they only had an
[1:27:12] intellectual conception
[1:27:15] they never had a real birth what you're
[1:27:17] talking about i know a brother
[1:27:19] who was a close friend of mine travel
[1:27:20] overseas when it came to preaching and
[1:27:22] breaking into the word
[1:27:24] amen you know at least what we call it
[1:27:26] amen and
[1:27:27] i don't think nobody could preach
[1:27:28] serpent seed like that man could
[1:27:31] where is he now denouncing this message
[1:27:35] the man who taught me one of the main
[1:27:38] men
[1:27:39] taught me through the scriptures this
[1:27:40] message is now
[1:27:42] no longer believing it am i to die
[1:27:47] i'm supposed to faint like i try to tell
[1:27:50] people i knew jesus before i knew them
[1:27:53] and god has never failed me yet
[1:27:57] and he never will he never will my point
[1:28:00] is this
[1:28:01] pressure is coming squeeze is coming
[1:28:04] hallelujah you're going to turn your
[1:28:05] back on god
[1:28:06] when you don't have rent a car payment
[1:28:12] huh what you going to do he's still god
[1:28:16] don't limit god even if you get hungry
[1:28:19] he's still a bread maker
[1:28:25] god can bring money from nowhere
[1:28:29] we're serving the real god you've got to
[1:28:31] know where you are
[1:28:33] and guess what the greatest battle ever
[1:28:35] fought is in your mind
[1:28:36] because that's where you come from out
[1:28:40] of the mind of god
[1:28:42] that's why the word of god says let this
[1:28:44] mind be in you that was also in christ
[1:28:45] jesus
[1:28:49] what who thought it not robbery to be
[1:28:51] equal with god
[1:28:53] i went through this the other day most
[1:28:55] of us feel you're so scared
[1:28:57] you're so scared to even claim that
[1:29:00] because you feel like maybe maybe maybe
[1:29:02] i'm moving into idolatry or
[1:29:04] maybe i'm moving into something that's
[1:29:06] bigger than me
[1:29:08] it's been ordained
[1:29:11] this is who you are this is what you
[1:29:14] are and it's unbelief if you can't claim
[1:29:19] it
[1:29:20] uh is something wrong with you
[1:29:23] if you don't go after it
[1:29:27] hallelujah is that right the prophet god
[1:29:30] said listen this message is full of
[1:29:31] blessings
[1:29:32] he said if i wasn't tall enough to go
[1:29:34] get it he said i climb up a ladder
[1:29:37] i find a way to get my blessings
[1:29:41] i find a way to get those things that
[1:29:44] are
[1:29:44] my inheritance hallelujah
[1:29:50] maybe y'all don't remember these and
[1:29:51] maybe you never did it but mama used to
[1:29:53] put the candy on a high shelf
[1:29:56] and that high chef amen amen was always
[1:29:59] a struggle
[1:30:00] hi i'm gonna get that candy when mama
[1:30:03] ain't looking
[1:30:06] but you know that old smart little boy
[1:30:09] gonna find something to get on top of
[1:30:13] y'all understand me he gonna get that
[1:30:16] candy
[1:30:17] and mom said how in the world did you
[1:30:19] get up there
[1:30:22] because you know what you do you hide
[1:30:24] you put away the thing that you helped
[1:30:25] that helped you
[1:30:26] like a stool or chair or whatever oh
[1:30:29] y'all don't know what i'm talking about
[1:30:30] right
[1:30:30] y'all been christian little babies
[1:30:33] hallelujah
[1:30:34] but you know it's the truth amen
[1:30:36] sometime when they put things in places
[1:30:38] that was not for you to go you went
[1:30:40] anywhere you found a way of getting into
[1:30:43] it
[1:30:43] but this has been put there for you to
[1:30:45] get into it
[1:30:48] let me ask you a question
[1:30:51] there is only one god
[1:30:54] now how you going to sit in his throne
[1:30:58] except you be a part of him oh my god
[1:31:03] hallelujah you've got to accept your
[1:31:05] portion of the godhead if i can say it
[1:31:07] like that
[1:31:07] i'm not trying to stumble nobody but i'm
[1:31:10] trying to tell you
[1:31:11] that that man was an unfolding of god
[1:31:14] we'll see the pill of fire
[1:31:16] we see that but we fail to see the man
[1:31:19] part and what did god make adam he made
[1:31:23] him a god
[1:31:24] and what did god call the prophets gods
[1:31:28] whom the word of god comes to hallelujah
[1:31:31] and guess what we're priests and kings
[1:31:35] hallelujah not of america but of that
[1:31:38] new jerusalem
[1:31:40] hallelujah and now god is trying to get
[1:31:42] our minds
[1:31:44] cleared up this thing is about grace
[1:31:47] hallelujah you know paul paul never
[1:31:49] became that
[1:31:50] that first messenger of that angel amen
[1:31:52] because of his studies he studied under
[1:31:54] gamalia
[1:31:56] he was a straight a student but paul
[1:31:58] said i've got to die to that
[1:32:01] i gotta count all of my teachings as
[1:32:03] dung
[1:32:04] in order for me to learn jesus christ
[1:32:06] for me to know him
[1:32:08] and paul did it for me to die his gain
[1:32:11] he says
[1:32:12] i must die to my will my ways and
[1:32:15] everything i
[1:32:15] must die that i might gain christ
[1:32:19] recognizing the part of the body you fit
[1:32:22] in
[1:32:23] and if you the bride the bride is a part
[1:32:26] of the husband
[1:32:27] the only place that you ever recognize
[1:32:29] it
[1:32:30] is recognize what part of the husband
[1:32:32] the word you are
[1:32:34] or you can't recognize being the bride
[1:32:38] hello are you a part of laodicea
[1:32:42] or you're a part of the capstone
[1:32:44] somebody help y'all so
[1:32:46] you're scared to even say it you're part
[1:32:48] of the capstone
[1:32:51] you say well what that's why when jesus
[1:32:54] christ do come again
[1:32:55] after the resurrection he brings his
[1:32:57] bride with him
[1:33:00] she's part of him
[1:33:03] but in just different bodies somebody
[1:33:07] help me here
[1:33:08] hallelujah the only place that you'll
[1:33:10] ever recognize it is recognize
[1:33:13] what part of that husband the word you
[1:33:16] are or you can't recognize being the
[1:33:18] bride
[1:33:18] how many sees that you know what that
[1:33:20] comes from the future home
[1:33:22] you've got to recognize what part right
[1:33:25] we're in the intelligence of god brother
[1:33:28] branham represented the eyes
[1:33:30] but the eyes took us away here
[1:33:34] the intelligence let this mind be
[1:33:38] in you why you think paul said that that
[1:33:40] was also in christ jesus
[1:33:43] he was the intelligence of god he was a
[1:33:45] mind of god
[1:33:47] why because god was in him
[1:33:50] you're the only people that god will
[1:33:52] ever share his mind with
[1:33:57] it's a covenant
[1:34:02] it's a unity do you know when you marry
[1:34:05] somebody
[1:34:06] it's a bond to death do us part
[1:34:10] it's a bonding y'all hear what i'm
[1:34:12] saying
[1:34:13] it's a union hallelujah
[1:34:18] he said in that day you'll know i'm in
[1:34:20] the father of the fathers in me and i am
[1:34:21] in you
[1:34:22] a union now i'm going to tell you
[1:34:24] something when i
[1:34:25] in the father father and me he and me
[1:34:27] and everything and when you look at me
[1:34:28] you just see
[1:34:30] one
[1:34:32] i don't grow three heads
[1:34:36] hallelujah just one man
[1:34:41] that's why jesus said if you know me you
[1:34:43] know the father
[1:34:46] somebody help me here what is it what
[1:34:49] you here for
[1:34:50] it's a manifest calvary to show the
[1:34:53] devil that
[1:34:54] god won he still wins
[1:34:57] he is the victor he conquered death hell
[1:35:00] in the grave
[1:35:01] for who his bride hallelujah roman
[1:35:05] romeo and juliet can't touch this
[1:35:08] hallelujah snow white and the seven
[1:35:10] dwarf can't touch this
[1:35:12] there ain't no story men can make up
[1:35:14] that can touch the
[1:35:15] love affair of god even solomon when he
[1:35:19] wrote the songs of solomon he did the
[1:35:21] best he could but let me tell you
[1:35:22] something
[1:35:23] you can't even understand that without
[1:35:26] revelation
[1:35:28] that was god inspired but that same
[1:35:31] songs of solomon
[1:35:32] need meditation and revelation
[1:35:36] because if you read songs of solomon you
[1:35:38] cannot you in trouble
[1:35:42] now that's the truth
[1:35:45] you can't recognize somebody else's day
[1:35:48] what if moses would have come
[1:35:50] with noah's message and noah was part of
[1:35:52] it
[1:35:54] but it wouldn't have worked what if
[1:35:57] jesus would have come with moses message
[1:35:59] it wouldn't have worked see it was
[1:36:01] different age
[1:36:02] it was a different prophecy a different
[1:36:04] part of the word had to be fulfilled
[1:36:06] there was there was in another day of
[1:36:09] the week they were in another day of the
[1:36:11] week
[1:36:12] y'all understand me that's why pentecost
[1:36:14] won't work here
[1:36:15] we're in the age of perfection
[1:36:18] am i am something wrong
[1:36:23] you and i must understand this is what a
[1:36:25] lot of the message believers have caught
[1:36:27] they got us standing there at pentecost
[1:36:29] let me tell you like this
[1:36:30] there's nothing wrong with the gifts i
[1:36:33] believe that the gifts should be in the
[1:36:35] church
[1:36:36] some people may not believe that but i
[1:36:38] believe but most of all
[1:36:40] right the statue of a perfect man
[1:36:44] must be the very very can i say it like
[1:36:46] this the very
[1:36:48] motive and move of god in you
[1:36:52] right because without the statue of a
[1:36:54] peru man the headstone cannot connect
[1:36:59] this is why so many people god is still
[1:37:02] unconnected
[1:37:03] see there has not been a union only by
[1:37:05] mouth but the union
[1:37:07] of god brings you into jesus in you
[1:37:10] hallelujah it is in that time amen you
[1:37:13] and
[1:37:13] christ become really one and the very
[1:37:16] work she did on earth is what you and i
[1:37:18] supposed to do now
[1:37:20] hey there is no laziness in god there is
[1:37:23] no
[1:37:24] slaughterness in god there is no
[1:37:25] lukewarmness in god
[1:37:27] it's fired up those early saints of god
[1:37:30] when the holy ghost filled them they
[1:37:32] were on fire
[1:37:35] you said what do you mean let me tell
[1:37:36] you something god sanctified them
[1:37:39] that's why they were able to get the
[1:37:40] holy ghost on the day of pentecost
[1:37:42] he said i breathed on you and they were
[1:37:44] sanctified
[1:37:46] we need some breathing we need some wind
[1:37:49] blowing
[1:37:50] hallelujah amen john said 14 5-7 thomas
[1:37:55] said unto him
[1:37:55] lord we know whether thou got and how
[1:37:59] can we
[1:37:59] know the way jesus says i am the way the
[1:38:02] truth and the life
[1:38:03] no man cometh unto me unto the father
[1:38:06] but by me
[1:38:07] huh you'll never know the father until
[1:38:09] you come by jesus
[1:38:12] because at some point in time jesus says
[1:38:14] listen i'm gonna go
[1:38:16] i'm leaving you but i'm going to be what
[1:38:18] i was before i came
[1:38:21] what was he before he came to the earth
[1:38:23] he was a pill of fire
[1:38:25] because when paul saw him on the on the
[1:38:28] road to
[1:38:28] damascus who art thou lord
[1:38:32] l o capital l i am jesus
[1:38:36] hallelujah when he stood there as a man
[1:38:39] he said i came in my father's name
[1:38:41] and ye will not receive me but to them
[1:38:44] that will receive me
[1:38:45] i gave them power to become the sons of
[1:38:47] god
[1:38:48] i gave them the authority listen there
[1:38:50] is always going to be a majority of
[1:38:52] people that's going to reject him
[1:38:54] there's going to be a majority of people
[1:38:56] that's going to come back with a false
[1:38:57] report but
[1:38:58] understand god didn't do all of this for
[1:39:01] nothing
[1:39:03] he's going to get those who he came for
[1:39:06] hallelujah i believe joshua and caleb
[1:39:08] was just a shadow and type
[1:39:10] to know that there's going to be a few
[1:39:14] hallelujah is that right because the
[1:39:17] headstone
[1:39:18] goes up is that what brother bam said he
[1:39:21] said and as the age goes
[1:39:23] he said fewer and fewer and fewer people
[1:39:26] will be saved
[1:39:26] now they can't be there to lay of the
[1:39:28] seal because that's a big platform
[1:39:30] but as it goes up it gets narrower and
[1:39:34] narrower
[1:39:36] hallelujah anyhow
[1:39:39] what what's the problem with us we need
[1:39:42] to really believe and accept the message
[1:39:45] whatever brother says and whatever god
[1:39:47] said through him we ought to say amen
[1:39:50] we need to learn how to meditate on it
[1:39:52] we need to stop looking at ourselves
[1:39:54] as just sinners are saved by grace we
[1:39:56] are but we have a position in christ now
[1:40:00] hallelujah is that right i cannot
[1:40:03] imagine
[1:40:04] amen rahab always talking about what
[1:40:06] happened to her in jericho
[1:40:09] her life changed
[1:40:12] somebody helped me i'ma say it again her
[1:40:15] life changed
[1:40:19] her family changed everything changed
[1:40:24] jesus said in 14 20 of john he said at
[1:40:26] that day you'll know that i am
[1:40:28] in my father ye and me and i in you
[1:40:31] but the comforter john 14 26
[1:40:34] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[1:40:36] will sin in my name
[1:40:38] he shall teach you all things now isn't
[1:40:40] that amazing
[1:40:41] the holy ghost got the same name jesus
[1:40:43] god and the father got the same name
[1:40:45] jesus god
[1:40:46] hallelujah that means they all named
[1:40:48] jesus
[1:40:50] why because it's just three
[1:40:52] manifestations
[1:40:53] of the same god i'm a husband
[1:40:57] i'm a preacher i'm a grandfather
[1:41:01] but my name is isaiah brooks because of
[1:41:03] my positions
[1:41:05] my name doesn't change
[1:41:09] and that's the way it is it's so simple
[1:41:11] but the intellectuals have made it
[1:41:13] difficult because
[1:41:14] they brought in the babylonian doctrine
[1:41:16] of trinity
[1:41:17] into the christianity
[1:41:22] is this okay i'm trying to get us if i
[1:41:25] can get you to see what i'm
[1:41:26] all i know is you know i've been doing a
[1:41:29] lot of crying
[1:41:30] just because i can see things i had
[1:41:32] never seen before
[1:41:34] and i'm not saying nobody else ain't
[1:41:36] preaching this i'm just saying
[1:41:38] i'm seeing something about me i'm seeing
[1:41:40] something that god has done
[1:41:42] for me that i didn't know i hadn't
[1:41:44] recognized it
[1:41:46] now i'm beginning to recognize and then
[1:41:48] really the
[1:41:49] fully the the message from me it's more
[1:41:52] than speaking in tongues it's more than
[1:41:54] shouting and dancing
[1:41:55] it's more than that it's maturing
[1:41:58] it's it's literally allowing the the the
[1:42:01] divine nature
[1:42:02] to take control
[1:42:05] so much so and i i love this quote what
[1:42:07] brother brahm said the early church
[1:42:11] was so in tune with god all he had to do
[1:42:14] was
[1:42:14] nod his head and they knew what to do
[1:42:17] that's what i'm saying maybe i'm
[1:42:21] dumb but i put it this way i want to
[1:42:23] know god so much
[1:42:25] and so well that all he has to do is nod
[1:42:28] i can just feel it and interpret and
[1:42:31] interpret his body movement
[1:42:33] and know what he wants me to do he
[1:42:36] see see that's what the church is doing
[1:42:38] today for jesus is the word and he is
[1:42:41] the bridegroom
[1:42:42] and the bride is a part of the groom
[1:42:45] therefore the word
[1:42:46] that is to be fulfilled now are we being
[1:42:49] called out to a marriage
[1:42:53] is that right it's matthew 25 and is
[1:42:56] what's happening
[1:42:57] we've been called out to go into a
[1:43:00] marriage
[1:43:01] is that right so listen and if you are
[1:43:04] if he is the brah if he's a groom that
[1:43:07] means you're the bride right
[1:43:10] remember the word is always male
[1:43:14] i don't care what people say today they
[1:43:16] want to make god a woman that's nonsense
[1:43:18] only the word the word always represents
[1:43:22] the male
[1:43:22] part of god the flesh
[1:43:26] represents the bride part of god
[1:43:31] i got a quote for that but anyway that's
[1:43:33] why i was bold enough to say it
[1:43:37] hallelujah why because the word could
[1:43:39] never fall
[1:43:41] but the flesh fell
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:48] huh that's why brother woman said that
[1:43:50] adam didn't fall in that sense
[1:43:52] he walked out willfully
[1:43:56] that's why you can't be deceived because
[1:43:58] you're the word
[1:44:00] if it was possible which is not
[1:44:04] you can't not be deceived i ain't
[1:44:06] talking about your flesh i'm talking
[1:44:07] about your soul
[1:44:09] hallelujah is that right because jesus
[1:44:11] said to the woman at the well
[1:44:13] i'm gonna give you living waters i'm
[1:44:15] gonna give you water
[1:44:16] amen and you'll never thirst again
[1:44:21] that's why we're not looking for some
[1:44:23] other man of god
[1:44:26] we've met jesus christ there's no
[1:44:29] releasing us from this message
[1:44:31] we're not going to walk from it we're
[1:44:32] not no sir we're anchored
[1:44:35] and our souls are anchored behind the
[1:44:37] veil
[1:44:38] it is people he's got your soul anchored
[1:44:42] your flesh might want to quit
[1:44:44] but god won't let you quit i give up
[1:44:48] god says like give up what you ain't
[1:44:51] going nowhere
[1:44:53] right he'll let you wander a little bit
[1:44:57] he'll snatch you right on back huh
[1:45:00] he can quicken you amen which is a real
[1:45:03] loving thing to do
[1:45:04] or he can spank you and run you back
[1:45:06] home
[1:45:08] he's got ways to do it hallelujah
[1:45:11] therefore the word that is to be
[1:45:12] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[1:45:15] the word
[1:45:16] that was fulfilled in his day i'm going
[1:45:18] to say it again
[1:45:23] why do you think the message has been
[1:45:25] crucified afresh
[1:45:29] because of you and we know what moses
[1:45:31] did he broke the continuity of the word
[1:45:34] but at the same time we understand that
[1:45:36] the bride must go through some of the
[1:45:38] same things
[1:45:40] that jesus went through and she'll still
[1:45:44] have the same power
[1:45:46] i understand what i'm trying to say now
[1:45:48] you're at a mature you're
[1:45:50] you're in a mature place a mature age
[1:45:52] right
[1:45:53] you mean to tell me you're going to let
[1:45:55] the earlier church
[1:45:57] before you out do you
[1:46:01] no and it's not a competition but what
[1:46:04] i'm trying to say
[1:46:05] amen a strong tree can hold more apples
[1:46:07] than a young one
[1:46:11] the strength is in the tree and the
[1:46:13] strength of god's supposed to be
[1:46:15] in you y'all understand me
[1:46:18] you are the tree of life
[1:46:21] because he is
[1:46:28] i learned something and uh i haven't
[1:46:30] searched it out yet
[1:46:31] but i had a brother call me the other
[1:46:33] day and you know he said brother books
[1:46:34] have you ever noticed
[1:46:36] that a fig tree doesn't have a female
[1:46:38] tree
[1:46:39] i'm like what yeah
[1:46:42] they're male and female one tree
[1:46:48] that's what i was told they don't
[1:46:50] pollinate
[1:46:52] that one tree the fig tree produces
[1:46:54] whatever it needs to produce
[1:46:56] male and female to bring forth figs
[1:47:00] quite interesting because that's jesus
[1:47:02] himself
[1:47:03] hallelujah and he calls israel what the
[1:47:07] fig tree
[1:47:11] well jesus christ didn't say come on
[1:47:13] bride
[1:47:14] ah y'all see we're two but we're one
[1:47:17] it was one in him he was male and female
[1:47:21] and that male and female produce what is
[1:47:24] that right
[1:47:25] the new jerusalem the mother of us
[1:47:28] all that's your bible
[1:47:33] hallelujah when god separated adam
[1:47:37] i just a little bit long i know i'm
[1:47:39] almost done i let you go at
[1:47:40] 9. he was bought he was both
[1:47:43] we found out adam was spirit to begin
[1:47:45] with he made man in his own image
[1:47:48] created male and female and then genesis
[1:47:50] 2
[1:47:51] on he created man out of the dust of the
[1:47:54] earth
[1:47:55] man was created in god's image god is a
[1:47:58] spirit
[1:47:58] so he's a spirit man then when he become
[1:48:02] flesh
[1:48:03] out of the flesh on the earth he is he
[1:48:05] is showing
[1:48:06] portraying here the bride
[1:48:12] the fleshy part he never taken
[1:48:15] and made another being but he took part
[1:48:17] of adam
[1:48:19] the original creation took him from him
[1:48:21] a real from the side
[1:48:23] and took the feminist spirit out of the
[1:48:25] atom and left the masculine spirit in
[1:48:28] there
[1:48:28] and placed it into the feminist part
[1:48:30] y'all understand what he did
[1:48:32] he took the natural part and the
[1:48:34] spiritual part
[1:48:36] to make the woman hallelujah
[1:48:40] therefore part of the spirit part of his
[1:48:43] body
[1:48:43] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word
[1:48:46] of his word
[1:48:47] life of his life and that's the way the
[1:48:50] bride is to christ
[1:48:51] you know why i'm kind of like going down
[1:48:53] sleep teaching a little bit kind of
[1:48:55] slowly
[1:48:56] because one day i i'm looking i'm
[1:48:57] expecting to preach it
[1:49:01] but i want to make sure you know where
[1:49:03] i'm getting this from because amen
[1:49:05] this is exciting to me to know that god
[1:49:08] has done a thing with us
[1:49:09] and now my eyes are opening my spiritual
[1:49:12] eyes are beginning to see
[1:49:14] amen exactly who i am and what i am
[1:49:17] right
[1:49:17] remember i said this the other day god
[1:49:20] didn't brother brahma didn't say
[1:49:21] when when the bride recognized who jesus
[1:49:24] is
[1:49:25] he did not say when the bride recognized
[1:49:27] who the father is
[1:49:29] the he said when the bride recognized
[1:49:31] who she is
[1:49:32] the rapture will then take place we're
[1:49:35] the last part
[1:49:37] of redemption when the bride is fully
[1:49:39] redeemed
[1:49:40] it's over it's over time really will be
[1:49:44] no more
[1:49:45] right i heard the prophet god said that
[1:49:48] when jesus christ come
[1:49:50] he said time will be no more just today
[1:49:53] in his corporal so this this this what
[1:49:56] we
[1:49:57] see in the visual in the in the clouds
[1:49:59] amen it's the beginning of
[1:50:01] this huh what happens
[1:50:05] eliezer introduces us to isaac
[1:50:09] and we're caught up to meet him in the
[1:50:11] air
[1:50:12] is that right she leaped off of her holy
[1:50:15] ghost
[1:50:15] holy ghost camel right and she met him
[1:50:20] brother said when she leaped off that
[1:50:21] was a type of her going into the air
[1:50:26] that's what this message is doing he
[1:50:28] said hey when everybody's denying the
[1:50:30] cloud
[1:50:30] he said but that's my lord the same
[1:50:33] thing john did
[1:50:34] that's my lord
[1:50:38] i get goosebumps up here i don't know
[1:50:39] what y'all feeling out there but this
[1:50:41] thing is really moving me
[1:50:42] amen he said he said listen he said
[1:50:46] that's why the rapture of the royal seed
[1:50:48] has to come
[1:50:48] first and the rest of the dead lived not
[1:50:52] for a thousand years
[1:50:53] then they were brought up at the white
[1:50:55] throne judgment see
[1:50:57] there is no judgment to the royal seed
[1:51:00] or predestinated seed of abraham if
[1:51:03] you'll take saint john 5 24 listen to
[1:51:05] this he that heareth my word
[1:51:07] and abideth on him believeth on him that
[1:51:10] sent me
[1:51:10] has everlasting life
[1:51:19] in closing for tonight
[1:51:24] lord willing i'll be here sunday
[1:51:28] he's at a wicked and adulterous
[1:51:29] generation that's matthew 16
[1:51:32] 4. seeketh after a sign
[1:51:36] and there shall no sign be given unto it
[1:51:39] but the sign of the prophet jonas and he
[1:51:42] left them
[1:51:43] and departed brethren said that was a
[1:51:46] sign
[1:51:48] of the resurrection
[1:51:51] first of all when the prophet of god
[1:51:54] came
[1:51:56] one of the greater things that he needed
[1:51:58] to do he showed the church world
[1:52:01] that jesus christ is risen
[1:52:04] his whole ministry he kept trying to
[1:52:07] tell the people
[1:52:08] don't look at me i'm not here to
[1:52:11] proclaim myself
[1:52:13] i came to proclaim the one who's
[1:52:16] who died for me he said that's jesus
[1:52:19] christ he said if i could
[1:52:20] heal all of you he said i would but i
[1:52:22] can't heal
[1:52:23] i don't have no power to heal you if i
[1:52:25] had power to heal you therefore i would
[1:52:27] have power to save you
[1:52:29] he said but i came to declare that jesus
[1:52:32] christ is the same
[1:52:33] yesterday today and forever not william
[1:52:35] branham
[1:52:37] y'all i tell you the two and i want you
[1:52:39] to understand
[1:52:41] when i say things like that god knows my
[1:52:43] heart i'm not saying anything against
[1:52:45] the prophet
[1:52:46] i'm just trying to tell you what the
[1:52:48] prophet has tried to do
[1:52:50] and we have allowed men to take the
[1:52:53] glory of god
[1:52:54] and put it on the prophet when he
[1:52:56] thought all of his life practically
[1:52:59] trying the people trying to get the
[1:53:00] people not to do that
[1:53:02] then we come around and do the very
[1:53:04] thing once he leave
[1:53:06] he left right now it's now now now
[1:53:09] the bible says according to hebrew when
[1:53:11] the veil is lifted
[1:53:13] is when they turn to the lord
[1:53:17] once you turn back to the lord jesus
[1:53:19] christ
[1:53:20] knowing that everything that did happen
[1:53:22] it was jesus christ
[1:53:25] knowing that the prophet of god had his
[1:53:26] place but jesus christ is your headship
[1:53:30] it is he who you fall in love with
[1:53:33] hallelujah
[1:53:34] it is he who you marry it is he you
[1:53:36] enjoying to is
[1:53:38] he a man who who save you or is he who's
[1:53:41] coming back for you
[1:53:43] hallelujah and this message is more than
[1:53:46] books and tapes
[1:53:47] it's a life and you and i
[1:53:51] must come somewhere we must come into a
[1:53:53] place where that life must enter into us
[1:53:56] if it does not we make no rapture
[1:53:59] amen you love the lord i've got to stop
[1:54:02] there
[1:54:03] but you and i must understand there's a
[1:54:06] there's a
[1:54:07] when israel traveled when they left the
[1:54:10] uh
[1:54:12] promised land they didn't just stop
[1:54:15] there in canaan only there was a
[1:54:18] mountain they had
[1:54:20] to possess y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:54:24] that's the type of the thunders and
[1:54:25] everything else amen and so cain
[1:54:27] uh uh uh joshua and caleb
[1:54:30] at the end of the day oh man joshua will
[1:54:32] say i still got my strength
[1:54:34] how long you been in the ho in god you
[1:54:36] still got your strength
[1:54:38] he said i got as much strength as i had
[1:54:40] when i was young
[1:54:41] what i need and what i want is my
[1:54:43] mountain
[1:54:45] give me my mountain and that's what we
[1:54:48] should understand we have a mountain
[1:54:52] you call it mount zion where the bride
[1:54:55] of jesus christ was set on the top of it
[1:54:57] with her husband
[1:54:59] oh my god i can't even father in my mind
[1:55:02] it's beyond me
[1:55:04] but i tell you what as long as we sit
[1:55:06] still
[1:55:07] and think god is just oh i'm just
[1:55:09] sitting still
[1:55:11] i'm going to be just ease in zion
[1:55:14] right god hates that he basically calls
[1:55:18] it
[1:55:18] lukewarm
[1:55:21] not the bride he said i would that you'd
[1:55:24] be hotter cold and if we're not hot you
[1:55:26] need to ask god to give you some hot
[1:55:28] give you some heat i pray all the time
[1:55:33] i want him i don't care i'm crazy
[1:55:36] looking
[1:55:38] right i don't care what i look like to
[1:55:39] other people i don't care if i lose
[1:55:42] all my friends or relatives and whatever
[1:55:45] more i don't
[1:55:46] care there's only one thing that i want
[1:55:50] and i'll let nothing stop me from
[1:55:52] getting it
[1:55:55] that ought to be your attitude
[1:55:57] hallelujah
[1:55:58] amen esther said if i perish let me
[1:56:02] perish i'm going to see the king and i'm
[1:56:05] telling you
[1:56:06] if you don't have that attitude about
[1:56:08] you you need to ask god to give it
[1:56:11] because i'm going to tell you what the
[1:56:12] pressure is going to come and if you're
[1:56:14] not rooted and grounded in your belief
[1:56:17] i ain't saying you got to be the
[1:56:18] strongest person because he said amen in
[1:56:21] our weakness he is our strength
[1:56:23] hallelujah god ain't going to let you go
[1:56:25] down if your bride he ain't gonna let
[1:56:27] can i say it again
[1:56:28] he's not going to let you go down
[1:56:31] we have not been ordained to go down
[1:56:33] we've been ordained to go up
[1:56:35] but you've got to have confidence that
[1:56:37] he that begun the good work in you is
[1:56:39] faithful to complete it
[1:56:41] i don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:56:44] he promised
[1:56:46] he promised me he promised you let's
[1:56:49] stand
[1:56:49] he promised standing on the promises of
[1:56:52] christ my king can you
[1:56:54] can we sing that and then i wanted to
[1:56:56] show you this little
[1:56:57] thing it's about 11 minutes and i just
[1:56:59] forgot about it but it's something i
[1:57:01] showed
[1:57:01] uh today and i'm not going to say that
[1:57:03] this is uh uh
[1:57:05] accurate or whatever uh you may be
[1:57:07] seated just a moment i forgot about it
[1:57:09] if troy would play that for me just
[1:57:11] something that somebody showed me i want
[1:57:12] you to understand
[1:57:15] if it doesn't happen this way it's
[1:57:17] happening
[1:57:19] and we must understand that we are in
[1:57:21] this thing where the one world order is
[1:57:23] going
[1:57:24] to take over now how far into this thing
[1:57:29] we will go i don't know we understand
[1:57:32] that
[1:57:33] this chip and everything that they're
[1:57:34] doing that's not the mark of the beast

[1:58:52] something's moving

[1:58:57] and it's not just our government it's
[1:58:58] the whole world y'all understand what

[1:59:21] and they calling it the new normal
[1:59:24] been seeing it all over the news and
[1:59:27] some of y'all still out here voting
[1:59:30] can y'all
[1:59:46] we're going to a different place which
[1:59:48] is a new normal
[1:59:49] a new normal a new normal new normal a
[1:59:52] new normal
[1:59:53] new normal embrace the new normal the
[1:59:55] new normal the new normal
[1:59:56] the new normal new normal this new
[1:59:59] normal is going to look
[2:00:00] very very different not normal but a new
[2:00:03] normal
[2:00:03] the new normal new normal there will be
[2:00:05] a new normal a new normal
[2:00:07] new normal a new normal than you know a
[2:00:09] neo-normal
[2:00:10] this is the new normal this is our new
[2:00:12] normal our new normal
[2:00:14] a new normal our new normal new normal
[2:00:16] of the new normal our new normal
[2:00:18] we will transition into the new normal
[2:00:21] this will be the new normal
[2:00:23] until a vaccine is developed
[2:00:29] i'm teresa greenfield and in iowa we
[2:00:31] take care of our own
[2:00:32] but really teresa greenfield takes care
[2:00:35] of herself
[2:00:36] as an executive greenfield helped run a
[2:00:38] home building company into bankruptcy
[2:00:43] it's very hard to do something the first
[2:00:46] time
[2:00:47] it is very easy to do something the
[2:00:49] second time
[2:00:50] what does a magician want you to do when
[2:00:52] he's doing a trick
[2:00:54] he wants you to look at the hand that's
[2:00:56] not doing the trick so you don't see the
[2:00:58] hand that's doing it
[2:00:59] they just want human consciousness to go
[2:01:02] in a certain way
[2:01:03] problem reaction solution problem
[2:01:05] reaction solution
[2:01:06] ladies and gentlemen that's how they do
[2:01:08] it you create the problem
[2:01:10] you get the reaction from the public on
[2:01:12] the basis of the way you've explained
[2:01:14] the problem which is not actually what
[2:01:15] happened
[2:01:16] and then you offer the solutions to the
[2:01:17] problems you have
[2:01:19] created something else that i said
[2:01:21] problem reaction solution was that the
[2:01:23] protests they needed the protest in
[2:01:26] order to justify the
[2:01:28] second wave bang what's matter
[2:01:32] protest pulling down statues the whole
[2:01:34] focus of attention has gone somewhere
[2:01:36] else there are other reasons for that
[2:01:37] but
[2:01:37] it's taken the focus away when the real
[2:01:39] focus should be
[2:01:41] look at the economic devastation of
[2:01:42] these lockdowns on every community
[2:01:46] any that should be the focus this
[2:01:48] happened just at the right
[2:01:50] time that they wanted it to get exactly
[2:01:51] the reaction that they wanted
[2:01:53] so maybe there's more to know about this
[2:01:55] and it's not just only what you see
[2:01:57] and i think there is more to come out
[2:01:58] about all that i really do it's kind of
[2:02:00] freaky folks you know when you see that
[2:02:02] sort of stuff
[2:02:03] you can see how long they've had this
[2:02:05] plan in the making you know
[2:02:07] worldwide economic forum rolling out
[2:02:09] their whole
[2:02:10] plan to restructure the world the great
[2:02:13] reset
[2:02:13] that we need to combat this terrible
[2:02:16] crisis
[2:02:17] and the terrible state of police
[2:02:19] brutality that we find ourselves in
[2:02:21] everything that these people who run the
[2:02:23] world economic forum have done
[2:02:25] and now they're offering us their
[2:02:26] solution which is to
[2:02:29] basically lock everybody into a smart
[2:02:32] prison the thing that will get us back
[2:02:34] is the vaccine
[2:02:36] until we have a vaccine zero tolerance
[2:02:38] so every time we see a case we basically
[2:02:41] pounce on it the vaccine
[2:02:42] vaccine the vaccine the vaccine to all
[2:02:45] seven billion
[2:02:46] people almost every expert agrees a
[2:02:48] vaccine is the fastest way to get our
[2:02:50] world back
[2:02:51] you know it's so important to get not
[2:02:54] just hundreds of millions but literally
[2:02:56] billions of those vaccines
[2:02:58] legislative amendments that would make
[2:03:00] vaccinations mandatory for public school
[2:03:02] students unless they have a medical
[2:03:03] exemption the vaccine is the thing that
[2:03:06] will change things the vaccine the
[2:03:08] vaccine
[2:03:09] on the issue of the vaccine which you've
[2:03:11] said in the past could take a year to 18
[2:03:13] months will
[2:03:14] we have to wait for a vaccine to hug our
[2:03:17] family and friends who are outside
[2:03:19] of our bubble
[2:03:23] you know we'll have to prepare for the
[2:03:25] next one that
[2:03:26] will get attention this time they're
[2:03:29] really pushing the second wave
[2:03:31] but this is just the beginning folks
[2:03:32] it's not going to go away
[2:03:34] i said that months ago this is not going
[2:03:36] to go away they're going to release the
[2:03:37] lock down a little bit and then they're
[2:03:39] going to ramp it up even more
[2:03:41] what they want to do you know the kovi
[2:03:43] past pass that everybody needs to have
[2:03:46] to show
[2:03:46] their infection free all the stuff they
[2:03:50] want to do
[2:03:50] they're trialling it in africa now
[2:03:52] they're calling it a trust
[2:03:54] pass to make sure you're vaccinated a
[2:03:57] vaccination
[2:03:58] record payment system is what they're
[2:04:01] talking about
[2:04:02] this is the payment system they want you
[2:04:05] to be
[2:04:05] scanned retinal scan facial scan
[2:04:08] biometric scans
[2:04:10] and that's how you're going to be paying
[2:04:13] you won't need
[2:04:14] cash anymore you won't even need your
[2:04:16] smartphone anymore you will be paying
[2:04:18] with your face
[2:04:20] and of course you'll need a record of
[2:04:22] vaccination in order to enter the store
[2:04:25] to begin with a cashless economy where
[2:04:27] people make purchases with their faces
[2:04:30] a giant network of surveillance cameras
[2:04:32] with facial recognition
[2:04:33] helps police monitor citizens ready for
[2:04:36] the new era of big brother
[2:04:38] this time is super surveillance maybe
[2:04:40] for your own good
[2:04:42] temperature
[2:04:50] a couple of years ago i did a show
[2:04:52] called giving life to lucifer when i
[2:04:54] talked about
[2:04:55] the whole role out of this smart grid
[2:04:58] the ais system
[2:04:59] and i said that in 2025 we are
[2:05:02] set to be in a very very different
[2:05:04] reality to where we are now
[2:05:06] by 2025 the whole system will be
[2:05:09] controlled by ai that's the way it's
[2:05:11] going
[2:05:11] if you can understand ai you can
[2:05:13] understand that
[2:05:14] ai is working to gain control for itself
[2:05:17] and you understand how these computer
[2:05:19] models work and why they're so
[2:05:21] now over the top and so the figures were
[2:05:23] so wrong
[2:05:24] but if you can think of a way of
[2:05:27] controlling and corralling human beings
[2:05:30] then it all begins to make sense it
[2:05:31] doesn't matter if the figures are wrong
[2:05:33] they just want
[2:05:34] human consciousness to go in a certain
[2:05:36] way and they want to merge us
[2:05:38] with the machine and you know the
[2:05:40] question is who is they
[2:05:41] and when you look at it folks it's
[2:05:44] like they is now ai the ai is
[2:05:48] already there you know we're waiting for
[2:05:50] artificial intelligence to
[2:05:52] emerge but really it's already emerged
[2:05:55] folks it's already there online
[2:05:57] we're just not looking at things the
[2:05:58] right way and what it's doing is it's
[2:06:01] basically creating a system whereby we
[2:06:03] are going to be completely dependent
[2:06:04] upon artificial intelligence in order to
[2:06:06] survive
[2:06:07] in order to perform everyday activities
[2:06:09] even going outside and purchasing a meal
[2:06:12] you're going to need the whole thing
[2:06:14] controlled by artificial intelligence to
[2:06:16] be able to move through that reality
[2:06:18] through the new world they're creating
[2:06:19] when you look at things such as the
[2:06:21] industrial revolution and you look at
[2:06:23] the
[2:06:23] periodic changes that society goes
[2:06:26] through every
[2:06:27] 50 to 100 years even more so every 200
[2:06:30] years
[2:06:31] there's always the birth of a new
[2:06:33] reality comes from the one before
[2:06:36] a new beginning if you will but what is
[2:06:38] the new beginning
[2:06:39] we're moving into it's really going to
[2:06:42] be
[2:06:42] a reality that is totally controlled by
[2:06:45] ai
[2:06:46] if we're not careful yeah the
[2:06:47] politicians i don't even think the
[2:06:49] politicians know
[2:06:50] exactly what they're doing i think too
[2:06:52] many people who've been involved in
[2:06:53] setting this up
[2:06:54] really bargained for what they were
[2:06:56] going to be getting it's like all the
[2:06:57] rock stars and the pop stars and all the
[2:06:59] superstars and all the sports stars and
[2:07:02] all these people that kept
[2:07:03] society distracted for so many years i
[2:07:05] said yeah a few weeks ago
[2:07:07] the miley cyruses and the madonnas and
[2:07:10] all these people have been used to keep
[2:07:11] us distracted
[2:07:13] they're all finding themselves on equal
[2:07:15] par now you know that video that madonna
[2:07:17] did in the bath
[2:07:18] when she was saying well we're all equal
[2:07:19] now if one goes down we all go down
[2:07:21] you know synonymous with the whole of
[2:07:23] society i mean because all the people
[2:07:25] all the rock stars and all the people
[2:07:27] that they paid all these exorbitant
[2:07:28] amount of money to keep us distracted
[2:07:30] they don't care about them they're all
[2:07:32] going down too
[2:07:33] i said that a few weeks ago you know
[2:07:35] it'd be a bit of a shock for these
[2:07:36] people to find themselves
[2:07:38] all locked in their own houses
[2:07:41] all having to deal with social
[2:07:43] distancing forget all that rock star
[2:07:45] world all the pop star world
[2:07:46] concerts and sports games and all that
[2:07:48] sort of stuff it's not going to happen
[2:07:49] folks it's not going back to normal
[2:07:52] people think that you know this is just
[2:07:54] a temporary thing no it's not
[2:07:56] there's also a new action called protect
[2:07:59] our neighbors folks you know they're
[2:08:01] wonderful aren't they
[2:08:03] they want you to spy on your neighbors
[2:08:04] basically folks like i said
[2:08:06] all the sleeping masses are the ones who
[2:08:08] are going to drag us into this
[2:08:09] if we're not careful so there's now a
[2:08:11] new program whereby
[2:08:12] you can protect your neighbors by
[2:08:14] keeping an eye on them making sure
[2:08:16] they're social distancing
[2:08:18] basically spying on them and dubbing
[2:08:20] them menu if they're doing the wrong
[2:08:22] thing
[2:08:22] under the guise of protecting them you
[2:08:25] know
[2:08:26] now is the time for everybody to realize
[2:08:28] that you know there's a war being waged
[2:08:30] against us
[2:08:31] and we have a lot of tools that we can
[2:08:32] use to fight this war and we can fight
[2:08:34] on the digital
[2:08:35] battlefield hit twitter hit facebook
[2:08:39] hit everywhere you can do everything you
[2:08:41] can to get the word out to people folks
[2:08:43] because there's nothing more important
[2:08:44] than this issue
[2:08:45] our whole world is changing it's not
[2:08:48] going to go back
[2:08:49] we're at a time in history where we find
[2:08:51] ourselves
[2:08:52] on the front line all of us we're on the
[2:08:54] front line here folks
[2:08:56] that's the thing older people just don't
[2:08:58] realize
[2:08:59] world war iii has already started it's a
[2:09:01] war that's being waged against the
[2:09:03] people of the world by the politicians
[2:09:05] of the world the problem is that people
[2:09:07] don't realize it's happening this
[2:09:10] response to this this
[2:09:14] social isolation this removal of
[2:09:18] even our oxygen we're not wearing masks
[2:09:21] this is
[2:09:21] such but like i said it's complete
[2:09:24] everything they're doing to us is to
[2:09:26] make us sick folks
[2:09:28] and that will be your second wave and
[2:09:31] the second wave will be fear and
[2:09:32] paranoia driven more than anything else
[2:09:34] i mean the first wave
[2:09:36] is fear and paranoia driven i mean how
[2:09:38] can i even have a second wave there
[2:09:39] wasn't a first wave
[2:09:41] there hasn't ever been a it's all been
[2:09:44] about this legislation it's all been
[2:09:45] about
[2:09:46] this police state the whole thing ladies
[2:09:48] and gentlemen these parasitic
[2:09:50] morons that we have masquerading as
[2:09:52] government what matters is that we
[2:09:54] realize what's happening
[2:09:56] and we realize the steps we need to take
[2:09:57] to get ourselves out of what's happening
[2:10:00] those steps we need to take to find
[2:10:02] freedom again
[2:10:15] i'm teresa greenfield and in iowa we
[2:10:18] take care
[2:10:20] hey man we appreciate your patience you
[2:10:22] might probably think it wasn't necessary
[2:10:24] but i just basically wanted to uh
[2:10:27] update you on some things and like i
[2:10:30] said if all is true that's fine we
[2:10:32] at least know where the world is headed
[2:10:35] nothing that we should fear but i think
[2:10:38] that we should
[2:10:39] understand that the time we're living in
[2:10:41] and i'll just give you a scripture
[2:10:43] because malachi 4 says that when that
[2:10:45] elijah would come
[2:10:46] what comes after it elijah
[2:10:50] has been going over 50 years now
[2:10:53] judgment
[2:10:54] firefall that's what made you know the
[2:10:57] elijah
[2:10:58] of malachi 3 john the baptist
[2:11:01] because the malachi 4 brings judgment
[2:11:05] and it was this this prophet of god that
[2:11:08] stood there and said i
[2:11:09] indict this generation god brought
[2:11:12] judgment
[2:11:12] west coast 1962 and then alaska almost
[2:11:16] sunk
[2:11:17] now we're at a time where everybody's
[2:11:19] you know busy busy busy it's a trick of
[2:11:21] the enemy
[2:11:22] and and you better understand we better
[2:11:24] refocus our lives
[2:11:25] amen and to make sure that you're right
[2:11:27] with god in your heart
[2:11:29] one of the worst things we could ever
[2:11:31] experience as individuals
[2:11:32] is to be left behind because we know no
[2:11:35] more truth
[2:11:36] than anybody else and so i i
[2:11:39] like i said i'm not i'm just trying to
[2:11:40] bring in more concern
[2:11:42] in the hearts of the people that they
[2:11:44] may understand that this thing is
[2:11:45] nothing to play with
[2:11:46] when a government can something can shut
[2:11:48] down the whole world
[2:11:50] put a fear on the entire world and
[2:11:53] understand
[2:11:54] if they didn't have the internet and
[2:11:56] have had the the circuits of
[2:11:58] of news and things like that they could
[2:12:00] have never done it
[2:12:01] but because they uh have the ability
[2:12:05] to do this we know that it's time
[2:12:07] because brother branham
[2:12:08] and the word of god says that even when
[2:12:11] those two prophets are killed in
[2:12:12] jerusalem
[2:12:13] that the whole world will be able to see
[2:12:15] so we know it is a is in an
[2:12:17] era where electronics and it's made
[2:12:20] possible
[2:12:21] by way of vision and television and all
[2:12:23] of that stuff
[2:12:24] we're in the last days and i read that
[2:12:27] scripture there
[2:12:28] in uh matthew amen to to under
[2:12:31] so you can understand that it's gonna
[2:12:33] get so bad
[2:12:35] and that was for the jews but it's you
[2:12:37] know a lot of scripture have dual
[2:12:38] meanings
[2:12:39] and that scripture is for us too uh i i
[2:12:43] had
[2:12:44] you know people get frustrated when
[2:12:45] you're trying to help them because you
[2:12:46] know we've had so much
[2:12:48] stuff propaganda and everything and
[2:12:50] sometimes you don't know what to listen
[2:12:51] to
[2:12:52] listen to the heart if god is dealing
[2:12:56] with you
[2:12:57] understand that it's later than you
[2:12:59] think
[2:13:00] it really is later than you think i'm
[2:13:02] not saying quit school
[2:13:04] quit jobs plant your potatoes
[2:13:08] have faith in god but understand listen
[2:13:11] if it comes shorter than what you
[2:13:13] expected that's okay
[2:13:15] because heaven will make up for it you
[2:13:17] understand me
[2:13:18] i don't want you to get slack in nothing
[2:13:20] whatever you giving your heart to as far
[2:13:22] as
[2:13:23] uh uh work and school and all of these
[2:13:26] other things if you've got something in
[2:13:28] your mind
[2:13:28] you want to achieve i'm not saying give
[2:13:30] those things up but at the same time
