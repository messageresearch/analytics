[0:00] Amen. Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[0:04] What a wonderful,
[0:06] wonderful time.
[0:09] Amen. You will always have if you allow
[0:11] it to quicken you.
[0:13] Ain't God good?
[0:15] We appreciate the Lord Jesus.
[0:19] Everything that has been said and done.
[0:20] You may be seated for just a moment.
[0:23] Now, I don't know how
[0:26] true this report is.
[0:28] Um, I should have brought my phone in
[0:30] like I intended to, but I just quickly
[0:33] forgot. Um,
[0:42] oh,
[0:43] okay.
[0:46] By the grace of God, amen. Uh we got a
[0:49] report uh from uh one of the pastors
[0:53] there in in Congo and uh his church was
[0:57] shut down
[0:59] because he didn't have theological
[1:02] uh degree and he wrote and said500
[1:06] churches have been shut down. Now um I
[1:11] got his name back there. I just can't
[1:13] think of it right now.
[1:15] But I want you to know that it's going
[1:16] to happen anyway.
[1:19] Whether it be true or not, we realize
[1:22] what God said is coming our way.
[1:26] Uh so I want you to understand that's
[1:28] why I'm going to be preaching this
[1:29] message. I was uh last week we preached
[1:32] on uh the gathering of the people.
[1:35] We showed you how the message came to
[1:37] gather us not to uh some denomination or
[1:42] organization but it came to gather us to
[1:46] Jesus Christ himself. And uh there must
[1:49] be a union. Amen. Uh that you and I must
[1:53] have otherwise we're going to miss this
[1:55] whole thing. Uh churchity is good. To be
[1:59] nice is good. To be uh a good person is
[2:02] a good thing. But uh the principle of
[2:05] the New Testament gospel be is based
[2:08] upon being born again. And you and I
[2:11] must be born again. And you and I must
[2:15] reach a a a place of maturity in Christ.
[2:18] It's not an option. It is what we must
[2:22] allow God to do for us. So, I want you
[2:25] to know that this that the enemy is on
[2:27] the move and uh you all who have been,
[2:31] you know, borderlining, we we better get
[2:34] it right. Amen.
[2:36] Now, I say this to encourage you. Uh we
[2:39] know that it's going to happen. How many
[2:41] how many of us have been really having
[2:42] mind battles? Oh my god. There is
[2:45] nothing like it. Uh you know, I can
[2:48] remember Amen. as a child or or a young
[2:52] Christian, you know, we have mind
[2:53] battles every now and again.
[2:57] Uh and now it's a constant mind battle.
[3:01] And I inquired of the Lord and and and I
[3:04] believe this morning uh God answered my
[3:07] prayer and he said to me that Satan is
[3:10] trying to instill fear in the people.
[3:16] Fear of being left behind. Fear of not
[3:19] being the bride. Fear. And the Bible
[3:23] tells us that fear is a tormenting
[3:25] spirit. It is of the devil. Come on,
[3:28] somebody. Now, I want you to understand,
[3:31] you don't have to be afraid. Amen. The
[3:33] word of God was brought to us through
[3:35] the prophet of God in the message
[3:37] shalom.
[3:38] Fear not. Peace be to the bride of Jesus
[3:42] Christ. And and if you believe that your
[3:44] bride Amen. And you you believe that
[3:47] with all of your heart, then God gave
[3:49] that to you. Amen. And no man can take
[3:51] that away from you. So I want you to
[3:54] realize, Amen. the pressure, the
[3:56] squeeze, Amen. All of these things that
[3:59] uh uh and I believe the uh message is
[4:02] authentic because it came from my
[4:04] precious brother uh Alistister there in
[4:06] South Africa. the brother wrote him and
[4:10] uh of course it circulated a lot of
[4:12] places and and I'm trusting and
[4:15] believing that uh you understand that it
[4:18] always start from the east and sweeps to
[4:20] the west. So you better understand that
[4:23] we're now living in a tight time. What
[4:26] we're getting ready to embrace in this
[4:28] coming year. Amen. Only God knows. But I
[4:32] just trust that by the grace of God, God
[4:34] will give us the right words to to
[4:36] utter. the right words to say that will
[4:40] prepare a little bride
[4:43] uh uh um for the coming of the Lord. Now
[4:47] remember we said last week a house
[4:49] divided cannot stand and you and I amen
[4:53] are
[4:55] keepers of one another. Is that right?
[4:58] You and I are keepers. We are
[5:00] responsible
[5:02] Amen. for each other. And uh if we if we
[5:06] can't be responsible for each other,
[5:08] then we're not even we won't even be in
[5:10] the bride because remember I shared and
[5:13] I haven't even got to the message yet,
[5:15] but I'm coming. Remember I shared last
[5:18] uh not long ago uh that that spirit I
[5:21] don't care. And I showed you where that
[5:24] originated from and it came from Cain.
[5:28] Am I my brother's keeper? See, you
[5:31] cannot allow yourself to adopt that kind
[5:34] of of of of now I I don't care what
[5:39] people think about me being a Christian.
[5:41] That that's properly used.
[5:45] But when you say, "I don't care when
[5:47] your brother's in trouble. I don't care
[5:50] about somebody's soul." You see what I'm
[5:53] saying? Then you then you're in pro you
[5:55] you got problems even with God,
[5:58] right? You can't even love your brother,
[6:02] right? You can't love God without loving
[6:04] your brother. Amen. Let's stand.
[6:10] Maybe we get some more on that in this
[6:12] evening. I don't know. I I just feel
[6:14] like encouraging you this morning
[6:15] because I realize, Amen, that we're
[6:17] living in the last days and and and and
[6:20] things are sweeping now. This brother in
[6:23] in the Congo was building a new church
[6:25] and they stopped him for even finishing
[6:27] his church. So, um, we realize, Amen.
[6:31] We're we're at a time that Satan is, um,
[6:34] really, uh, uh,
[6:39] uh, getting to the people. And we hope
[6:43] by the grace of God, you have a refuge.
[6:46] You have a refuge. 1 Samuel, please.
[6:55] You know it's coming, right?
[6:59] I really believe that I have would have
[7:01] had a call by now or some type of letter
[7:04] because I've had this for a few days
[7:06] now.
[7:08] Uh on top of this, my computer went out
[7:11] on me. Then my son and I was trying to
[7:14] fix some things yesterday and then I
[7:16] discovered last night that almost all my
[7:19] documents that I've
[7:21] made vanished.
[7:23] Uh was left with just a few things. And
[7:27] so last night I'm thinking, Lord, what
[7:31] on earth is going on with all the
[7:34] battles and things and because my
[7:36] computer was where I listen to brother
[7:38] Brandham's message and things like that
[7:40] and anyway, by the grace of God, uh I
[7:44] think he was trying to make me sad. uh
[7:47] you know but he got another thought
[7:49] coming
[7:51] you know because God you know it's like
[7:53] when that man in the airport asked me oh
[7:55] you that kind of a Christian that
[7:56] carries his Bible I said no I said my
[7:58] Bible is written on the tables of my
[8:00] heart and all I've got to do is think
[8:02] about him and I got joy amen
[8:07] sick the other day I don't want to miss
[8:08] saying that we were supposed to go up to
[8:11] uh uh Ames there as a Bible study I mean
[8:14] I I really felt like that flu was
[8:16] getting ready to go for juggler.
[8:19] My ear was hurting. My eyes were
[8:21] hurting. Oh my. I'm like, "Oh, Lord
[8:23] Jesus." I was just really feeling bad.
[8:25] Brother Keith called me. I couldn't even
[8:27] answer the phone. I said, "I can't talk
[8:29] to nobody right now." But by the grace
[8:32] of God, that next morning when I woke
[8:34] up, God had touched this old man's body.
[8:36] It's been a This is a miracle. If you
[8:39] ever if you've ever been hit with the
[8:41] flu, there's no way, no one day.
[8:45] Whatever it was, it started a little bit
[8:47] Wednesday and I was battling then, but
[8:49] then God comes along and he just fully
[8:51] touched me.
[8:53] It is a miracle. Now, you you don't you
[8:56] don't you said, "Brother Brooks, you
[8:57] don't look like you had the flu. I don't
[8:58] care what I look like. I just know what
[9:00] God did to me." Amen. Amen. Somebody
[9:04] prayed. Amen. And I'm glad. Amen. Praise
[9:06] the Lord. Amen. Let us go. Amen. To 1
[9:09] Samuel, please. We're going to start
[9:12] with the second chapter. Beginning
[9:16] at the first verse.
[9:19] And Hannah prayed and said, "My heart
[9:22] rejoices in the Lord. My horn is exalted
[9:26] in the Lord. My mouth is enlarged over
[9:29] my enemies. Because I rejoice in thy
[9:33] salvation." Listen. Because I rejoice
[9:39] in thy salvation. There is the victory.
[9:42] There is none holy as the Lord, for
[9:45] there is none beside thee, neither is
[9:47] there any rock like our God.
[9:51] Talk no more so exceeding proudly.
[9:56] Let not arrogancy come out of your
[9:58] mouth, for the Lord is a God of
[10:02] knowledge, and by him actions are
[10:06] weighed. And that's my subject. By him
[10:10] actions are weighed.
[10:13] The bows of the end of the mighty men
[10:15] are broken. And they that stumbled are
[10:19] girdled with strength. They that were
[10:22] full have hired out themselves for
[10:24] bread. And they that are were hungry
[10:28] ceased. So that the barren have borne
[10:32] seven.
[10:34] Hello somebody. So we can't miss it.
[10:38] Hannah's prophecy says she bore seven
[10:42] seven church ages. Hallelujah.
[10:45] Amen.
[10:47] And she have many ch her a and she that
[10:50] have many children is wax feeble. Come
[10:54] on. We know what it is out there. Yes
[10:57] sir. The Lord killth and maketh alive.
[11:00] He bringeth down to the grave and
[11:02] bringeth up. Hallelujah. The Lord maketh
[11:04] poor and maketh rich. He bringeth the
[11:07] law and lifted up. He raised up the poor
[11:10] out of the dust and lifted up the beggar
[11:14] uh uh from the dungill to set them among
[11:17] princes and to make them inherit the
[11:20] throne of God. For the pillars of the
[11:22] earth are the lords and he have set the
[11:25] world upon them. Hello. He that
[11:29] overcomemeth I will make him a pillar.
[11:32] Hallelujah. Amen. and he will keep the
[11:34] feet of his saints, and the wicked shall
[11:38] be silenced in darkness. For by strength
[11:41] shall no man prevail. The adversaries of
[11:44] the Lord shall be broken to pieces. Out
[11:47] of heaven shall he thunder upon them,
[11:50] and the Lord shall judge the end of the
[11:52] earth, and he shall give strength unto
[11:56] his kings, and exalt the horn of his
[12:01] anointed.
[12:02] Huh?
[12:05] Oh my
[12:08] Lord, we come before you as humbly as we
[12:12] know how. And we thank you for your
[12:15] grace. We thank you for your mercy. We
[12:19] thank you for your love, divine, and
[12:21] everything that you have done for us.
[12:23] Lord, you've been better to us than
[12:26] we've been to ourselves. Father, forgive
[12:28] us of all of our sins, all of our
[12:31] shortcomings,
[12:33] all of our fears, all of our unbeliefs
[12:36] and doubts, Lord. Oh God, those things
[12:39] that Satan have tried, oh God, to uh
[12:42] penetrate us with, but Lord, you got a
[12:44] wall of fire, hallelujah, about us,
[12:47] Father. And we thank you for your grace.
[12:50] We thank you for your mercy. We thank
[12:53] you for your love. Lord, have thine own
[12:55] way here this morning. We ask it in
[12:57] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You
[13:01] may be seated.
[13:04] Amen. We'd like to say this morning, we
[13:07] are truly a blessed people. Amen. There
[13:10] are no others like we like those of us
[13:13] who are been born have been born again
[13:15] of the spirit of the living God. Amen.
[13:18] And think about it, people. We have
[13:21] come, amen, to a time, amen, that this
[13:24] race is almost over. Amen. Is that all
[13:27] right? Amen. You say, "Well, brother
[13:29] Brooks, I'm not sure whether I rather
[13:31] whether I want it to be over." Praise
[13:32] God. I'm glad. Amen. That this time
[13:35] period is not based upon our feelings.
[13:38] Amen. Hallelujah. But it's based upon
[13:41] what God has already established. And by
[13:45] the grace of God, he'll not go one
[13:47] second beyond the time he said he would
[13:51] return.
[13:52] Amen. I uh come to church. We were
[13:55] listening and hear a song I hadn't heard
[13:58] in a long time. He said he's coming back
[14:01] because he said he would and that he was
[14:04] coming soon. And I thought, Lord, Amen.
[14:06] What a wonderful s song. Amen. Even
[14:09] though I didn't like the song, but I
[14:11] like the words.
[14:13] Amen. So, by the grace of God, I I just
[14:16] want to encourage you because I want you
[14:19] to understand that the thing that
[14:21] brother Brandon was trying to bring to
[14:23] us was a supernatural world.
[14:27] Hallelujah. And he basically showed us
[14:30] that the only way that you can get there
[14:32] is that you must be born supernaturally.
[14:35] Amen. Now, you and I were born natural.
[14:39] We were born natural. And that was the
[14:41] only way. You've heard me say that again
[14:43] before. We were born in this world. We
[14:46] weren't plant transplanted. Neither were
[14:48] we brought here by some alien.
[14:51] But there took a mating, amen, of a
[14:53] mother and a father that conceived you
[14:56] in the heart of the earth or the womb of
[14:59] the earth. Is that right? Amen. And they
[15:02] brought you forth. You had to come
[15:04] through trials. You had to come through
[15:06] pressure. You had to come through what
[15:08] we call a squeeze to get here. No doubt.
[15:11] Amen. As I said last week, Amen. If if
[15:14] if I was a child or a child that was
[15:17] just born and could speak or talk, Amen.
[15:19] We no doubt would say, "It was a rough
[15:21] time coming, but I made it." Amen. So,
[15:25] you and I must realize there's no other
[15:28] way to be born into heaven other than
[15:32] the rough way. Hello. The prophet of God
[15:35] said, "It's a mess." It is truly a mess.
[15:39] And you say, "Well, oh, brothers, I'm
[15:41] born again. I know I've been born
[15:42] again." But you must realize, Amen.
[15:45] There is a time of maturing. Amen. Come
[15:48] on. Now, probably God preached a message
[15:51] statue of a perfect man. And he said
[15:53] that every one of those virtues are
[15:55] victories. God just don't give it to
[15:58] you. God just don't drop it in your lap.
[16:01] Amen. But it is a time testing. It is a
[16:03] thing that you and I must go through. We
[16:06] must live it. We must fight. Amen. until
[16:08] we die. We didn't come here for a
[16:10] picnic, but we came to declare, amen,
[16:14] who Jesus Christ is and that he is the
[16:17] same yesterday, today, and forever. Is
[16:20] that all right? Amen. Romans, Amen.
[16:23] Romans 8:11 said, "But if the spirit of
[16:25] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[16:28] dwells in you, he that raised up Christ
[16:32] from the dead shall also quicken your
[16:35] mortal body." Amen. Is that all right?
[16:38] Amen. Because I want you to realize
[16:40] Amen. A lot of times we think we've got
[16:43] so much to do. The only thing we must
[16:46] do, and you've heard me say it again,
[16:48] someday or somehow it must penetrate
[16:51] your heart. The only laboring, amen, a
[16:55] true child of God does or must do, and
[16:58] that is to labor into his rest.
[17:03] Right? You must labor until you come
[17:07] into his rest. Let me say it again. You
[17:11] must labor. Amen. Until you come into
[17:15] his rest. And that's why it's so
[17:18] difficult for us in this age because we
[17:21] are in the most laziest age ever,
[17:25] right? We don't like to work. We don't
[17:27] like hard stuff. Come on, somebody. But
[17:30] it is to labor. And let me say it like
[17:33] this. You're not going to find too many
[17:35] message churches preaching what I'm
[17:36] talking about. They're going to tell
[17:38] you, "Amen, you got it once you believe
[17:40] it." Hallelujah. But it's deeper than
[17:43] that. That's not just not He's not
[17:45] talking about a head belief. He's
[17:47] talking about a heart belief. And
[17:50] wherever there's a true belief, there is
[17:53] a action. Amen. After the reaction,
[17:58] y'all hear what I'm saying? It is a
[18:00] labor. That's why so many people, amen,
[18:02] got it intellectually. They know how to
[18:05] quote the word, to quote the prophet.
[18:06] They know how to do all those things.
[18:08] But it ain't about that. It's about the
[18:10] life. Amen. That must follow you after
[18:15] the belief. Amen. You hear what I'm
[18:16] saying? It's not that we receive God.
[18:19] It's that God receives us. He is the one
[18:23] that stamps the the approval into our
[18:25] soul. Amen. that we have met the
[18:28] qualifications of a true believer.
[18:32] Now, I'm going to show you, we said last
[18:34] week, we were more than conquerors. So,
[18:36] I I'm going to read this quote again so
[18:38] you can understand, amen, that you
[18:40] you're not the conqueror, he is. Now,
[18:43] but if you get him on the inside, you
[18:46] become the conqueror. Hallelujah. Come
[18:49] on, somebody. If you pouring a cup
[18:51] pouring a glass of Pepsi into my glass
[18:54] out of a Pepsi bottle, it's not going to
[18:56] change the Pepsi.
[18:58] The Pepsi going to still be Pepsi in my
[19:00] glass.
[19:02] Hallelujah. No matter though I might be
[19:05] shaped different than the bottle.
[19:08] Hallelujah. But it's the substance that
[19:10] I'm looking for, not the bottle. Amen.
[19:12] Hallelujah. That's why Paul said, "We
[19:14] don't know Jesus Christ no more after
[19:16] the flesh. We know him after the spirit.
[19:19] It's the substance. Amen. That we're
[19:22] looking for. The mighty conqueror. He
[19:25] died as a witness to the earth, to a
[19:28] witness to the prophet, a 33y old. He
[19:31] conquered the cross. He conquered the
[19:34] shame. He conquered every devil. What?
[19:37] He conquered your devil. He conquered
[19:39] your devil. He conquered your devil. I
[19:42] don't care what your devil is. He
[19:44] conquered your devil.
[19:46] every devil. And when he was dying,
[19:49] Jehovah God turned his face on him and
[19:52] he died alone, forsaken by God and man.
[19:55] And in the midst of all, he was more
[19:57] than a conqueror. Amen. Oh, I feel
[20:00] pretty religious right now. He was more
[20:02] than a conqueror in the face of every
[20:05] difficult death itself and forsaken of
[20:08] God.
[20:11] Hallelujah. Even when you feel like
[20:13] you're forsaken, you're still a
[20:15] conqueror. Hallelujah. He conquered that
[20:18] feeling. He conquered that emotion. He
[20:21] conquered all of that for you and I.
[20:23] Hallelujah.
[20:25] Oh my. He walked to the front line like
[20:27] a conqueror. Died in such a way to even
[20:30] the people who stood by had to witness
[20:33] that he was. The earth shook and took a
[20:36] nervous prostration. A chill run open
[20:39] over its back for shame. And its own
[20:42] creator had dropped had to drop his
[20:46] blood on the earth to redeem it. The
[20:48] moon and the stars refused to shine. The
[20:51] Roman centurion said, "Truly, that was
[20:53] the son of God." Pilate said, "I washed
[20:56] my hands from him." Judas the Scar said,
[20:58] "I betrayed innocent blood." What was
[21:00] it? Everything that he had recognized
[21:03] him. He everything had to recognize him.
[21:06] He'd been prophesied. This is the Garden
[21:08] of Eden, the woman's seed, all prophets,
[21:11] everything gave. Notice it spoke forward
[21:14] to that time when the greatest conqueror
[21:17] when he would come and conquer
[21:19] everything that Adam lost in the fall.
[21:22] Conquered. If he didn't conquer it,
[21:24] there will not be a resurrection. But
[21:27] because he conquered, that is a
[21:29] resurrection. There is a translation.
[21:32] There is a change of the body. There are
[21:34] Christians on the earth because he
[21:36] conquered it. Amen.
[21:40] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Is that all
[21:42] right? Amen. He says, "Listen, and we
[21:46] don't have to worry about it. We're safe
[21:48] in his arms." Hallelujah. Those of us
[21:51] who've been born again, chosen of God,
[21:54] we're safe in his arms. Hallelujah.
[21:56] We're hiding under the shelter of his
[21:58] wings. Oh my God. Hallelujah. You mean
[22:01] the almighty God uh can shelter me under
[22:04] eagle's wings? That's where I am this
[22:06] morning. That's where you are this
[22:08] morning. Put your trust in God and God
[22:11] alone.
[22:13] Is it a notice? Before the flood, not
[22:16] one drop of water had ever fallen until
[22:19] Noah and all that would be saved from
[22:21] the flood was inside the ark and the
[22:23] doors closed.
[22:25] Woo! Come on, somebody. And we see that
[22:28] before one lump of fire could fall from
[22:30] the heavens of Sodom and Gomorrah, that
[22:33] Lot had to leave the city and be
[22:35] altogether out of the way of judgment.
[22:38] Oh, come on, somebody. Oh, can't you
[22:41] hear what he's saying? Hallelujah. For
[22:43] the righteous judge could not judge that
[22:46] just uh uh with the unjust because the
[22:49] believer has already been judged when
[22:53] Christ was judged in his place. Amen. Oh
[22:57] my God. Oh my God. How can you sit still
[22:59] like that? Hallelujah. That know that
[23:01] you've already been judged by Jesus
[23:04] Christ.
[23:07] Hallelujah. Yes, brother. No more
[23:09] judging.
[23:11] Oh, right. Now, hallelujah. You're
[23:13] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[23:16] Jesus. Hallelujah. You can't sit there
[23:19] and be a sinner. You must be saved,
[23:23] holy, and sanctified. That's the only
[23:25] way you could ever be in heavenly places
[23:27] in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. It ain't
[23:30] got nothing to do with this old nasty
[23:31] flesh that's that's covering you right
[23:33] now. Hallelujah. Derek, you can't put no
[23:35] trust in the flesh. The Bible said, "Put
[23:38] no trust in your flesh." That's not
[23:40] where my trust is. My hope and trust in
[23:43] Jesus Christ alone.
[23:46] man has said once since the ages began.
[23:49] Listen, he says all after he's already
[23:52] accepted our judgment in Christ. Is that
[23:55] right? Let me say this folk. Therefore,
[23:57] it would be unjust for the holy God to
[24:00] judge them again
[24:02] after he's already accepted our judgment
[24:05] in Christ. That's how come you missed
[24:08] the judgment. Amen. Because he was he
[24:11] judged Jesus Christ. And when Jud Jesus
[24:14] Christ was being judged, guess where you
[24:16] were? You were in him. Hallelujah. You
[24:20] were in him. Hallelujah. So as he
[24:22] conquered, you conquered, too. And the
[24:25] devil say you can't make it. He's a
[24:26] liar. The devil say you're not an
[24:28] overcomer. He's a liar. Hallelujah. The
[24:31] devil says, "Amen, you can't get rid of
[24:33] certain things." He's a liar.
[24:36] Hallelujah. It's already been conquered.
[24:40] Already been conquered. Why you want to
[24:42] believe the devil? Hallelujah. Let's
[24:44] hold fast to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[24:46] Is that all right? Already judge. That's
[24:49] right. See, a man like to be a
[24:51] conqueror.
[24:53] And it's a great thing to be a
[24:54] conqueror. A conqueror is one who has
[24:56] overcome overcome his enemy. That's the
[24:59] reason I believe the scripture says that
[25:01] we're more than a conqueror. See, you
[25:03] wouldn't even be here if you hadn't
[25:05] conquered something. Hallelujah. Come
[25:08] on, somebody. You done conquered some
[25:09] things.
[25:11] That's why you're here. Hallelujah. I
[25:13] don't care if the devil got a hold of
[25:15] you somewhere, but you understand the
[25:17] anointing is the thing that breaks the
[25:19] yolks. If you can get into the anointing
[25:21] here this morning, God will break the
[25:23] yolks. I don't care what it is. Fear,
[25:26] doubt, unbelief, God will break and
[25:30] destroy the yoke. He's already done it.
[25:37] Hallelujah. Is that all right? That's
[25:39] the reason I believe that that that the
[25:42] uh scripture says that we're more than
[25:44] conquerors for he has conquered for us.
[25:49] Hallelujah. Y'all done heard the story.
[25:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That old man go
[25:54] to work every day. Amen. Where this the
[25:56] way it used to be. Go to work every day.
[26:00] Amen. Work hard. Hallelujah. And that
[26:03] old that's that little sister, she's at
[26:05] home waiting for the big payday. My my
[26:08] my sister used to say, you know, we're
[26:11] waiting for the eagle to fly
[26:13] because, you know, back in the day, all
[26:15] those checks had eagles on it, you know.
[26:17] Amen. And so, so, you know, that woman,
[26:21] Amen, she she he waiting for that big
[26:23] great day. And she never had to work
[26:25] like he did. She got he went out there
[26:28] and he worked sweaty and, you know, come
[26:30] home tired and everything, but oh,
[26:32] Friday is the big day. Hallelujah. She
[26:35] He comes home and slaps that check into
[26:38] her hand.
[26:40] He's the conqueror.
[26:42] Hallelujah. He's the conqueror. But
[26:46] she's more than a conqueror
[26:48] cuz she get the paycheck. She didn't
[26:51] have to work for it. Hallelujah. She
[26:54] just received the benefits of his
[26:56] working. So is it with Jesus Christ. You
[26:59] don't have to work for the salvation.
[27:01] The salvation has already been paid for.
[27:04] Allighty.
[27:06] Hallelujah. I'm going to tear up the
[27:08] roof. Huh?
[27:10] Hallelujah. So, I want you to realize,
[27:12] Amen, what we're working with here.
[27:14] Amen. You say you believe, but God is
[27:16] weighing your actions.
[27:19] Huh? I'm going to get to Hannah in just
[27:20] a minute. Amen. Now, he goes on to say,
[27:23] listen, when hours pass by, he talks
[27:26] about him and everybody like to be a
[27:28] conqueror. Is that all right? And men in
[27:30] these great times when they were u
[27:32] moving forward when they conquer they
[27:34] usually have a great celebration
[27:36] afterwards. We all told that when the
[27:38] late uh head of Hitler had conquered
[27:41] France that he took his seat at the ark
[27:44] of triumph. Now you know how I wish I
[27:46] you know honestly I tell you what when
[27:48] you see those Germans amen kicking them
[27:50] legs. Amen. In those goost steps that is
[27:53] so intimidating.
[27:56] That is so intimidating, you know, with
[27:58] their legs up like that and then they
[28:00] you know any I don't know how they do
[28:02] it, but it's it's so uniform. It's so
[28:04] powerful and you know, you you see that
[28:06] and you you think about how they
[28:08] celebrated. Amen. Uh Hitler's uh triumph
[28:11] over over France and and you look at
[28:14] this thing and you say, "Well, well, you
[28:16] know, there there's a great celebration
[28:20] awaiting us.
[28:22] We didn't do nothing. He did it all."
[28:25] Amen. But he will lead us into this
[28:29] great celebration
[28:31] of overcoming everything in the world.
[28:35] See, the devil think he got some stuff
[28:36] that's better than what heaven has. And
[28:39] the only way that he can deceive us
[28:41] because we hadn't been there yet. Y'all
[28:44] hear what I'm saying? But Paul left us a
[28:46] word and said, "The suffering of this
[28:48] world cannot be compared to the things
[28:50] or the glory that God has in store for
[28:54] us. Amen. Oh, don't get confused. You're
[28:58] going to die. If the Lord Terry and the
[29:00] rapture don't take place soon, you and I
[29:03] going to die. We're going to die.
[29:07] Mom, daddy could be holding your hand.
[29:10] It doesn't matter. Your time coming,
[29:12] you're going to die. Like I was telling
[29:14] the young brothers, Amen. in Sunday
[29:16] school lesson,
[29:18] if you're going to die, die in the name
[29:21] of Jesus. Die in the name. you're going
[29:24] to die. But if you got to lay down your
[29:26] life, lay it down for Jesus.
[29:30] Cuz if you lay it down for him, you're
[29:32] going to pick it up again. Hallelujah.
[29:35] Think about it now. In order to win this
[29:37] race, in order to win this war, your
[29:39] motives and objective must be right.
[29:43] Right? That's what happened to Hitler
[29:44] and the rest of them. Their motives and
[29:46] objective wasn't right.
[29:49] They wanted all the glory. They wanted
[29:51] to be the sin of attraction. They're the
[29:53] big guys. They're the big things. Amen.
[29:56] But listen to what David's motive was.
[29:59] When he conquered Goliath, his motive
[30:02] was, he said, "Is there not a cause? Is
[30:05] there not a cause where these
[30:08] Philistines are boasting themselves
[30:10] against our Lord, our God? Is there not
[30:13] a cause?" Amen. that I should whoop this
[30:17] giant to show and to prove to them that
[30:21] God is still God. Hallelujah. See,
[30:23] that's what we're here for. We're here
[30:25] as Christians, not to not to be popular,
[30:28] not to have a big name, not to have a
[30:31] thing uh uh um uh uh what they call it.
[30:34] Amen. But we're here to declare that
[30:37] Jesus Christ is Lord. He's still God.
[30:42] You don't have to believe it, but God
[30:44] healed me. I know what the flu is like.
[30:46] Amen. And God knows I hate the flu. And
[30:49] I saw this thing coming. It's getting
[30:50] ready to go for the juggler. Yeah. Put
[30:52] me down. I know it was. Amen. You know
[30:55] how you feel it. It's all over you. And
[30:57] I'm thinking, how many days this thing
[30:59] going to hold me? You know, you know how
[31:00] the devil come. But the next day, the
[31:02] following day, God had done strengthened
[31:05] me. I couldn't believe it. I'm looking
[31:08] like, where is it?
[31:11] Oh, y'all see I got a people. Y'all know
[31:14] what the flu is?
[31:16] Amen. It's the truth. It's the truth.
[31:19] It's something that you just do not
[31:21] want.
[31:24] Hallelujah.
[31:28] I think about brother Randy. We were
[31:30] some where we went in Canada. Amen. And
[31:32] we saw a little a little commercial and
[31:36] this man had the flu and he was in bad
[31:38] shape. bad bad shape. He couldn't hardly
[31:41] move. And he was laying there like,
[31:43] "Help,
[31:44] somebody help me."
[31:49] And his wife comes along and throw him
[31:51] some kind of Tylenol or something.
[31:54] But he was in such bad shape he couldn't
[31:56] move. Anybody been there before?
[31:58] Hallelujah. So that's why I'm rejoicing
[32:00] here. That's why I'm rejoicing. Amen.
[32:02] Cuz I thought, Lord, would I be able to
[32:04] preach on Sunday with him? Hallelujah.
[32:07] All I'm saying is that he's more than a
[32:09] conqueror.
[32:13] Hallelujah.
[32:15] Amen. Amen. Ain't God good to us? Now,
[32:19] the point is, Amen. If you going to win
[32:21] this battle, Amen. Brother Brandham
[32:23] couldn't couldn't heal some nobody
[32:24] because he felt like he wanted to. He
[32:27] sought the will of God. Hallelujah. And
[32:30] his whole purpose, Amen, is that God
[32:32] would be seen, not brother Adam. He
[32:35] wanted Jesus Christ to be seen. And if
[32:39] you're going to win a battle, your your
[32:41] purpose and your reason for winning the
[32:44] battle must be that God will get
[32:47] glorified out of it. Glorification out
[32:49] of it. Is that all right? Amen. Let me
[32:52] move on by the grace of God.
[32:55] Now, here I am. I'm talking about
[32:56] Hannah. Now, let me just move there just
[32:59] a minute and then we'll come back to
[33:00] something else. There is no fear.
[33:03] Mhm. See, we must know this, especially
[33:06] right now. You must know that God is in
[33:09] your heart. Amen. He said, "In that day,
[33:11] you'll know that I am in the Father, the
[33:12] Father's in me, I am in you." Amen.
[33:14] Right? You must know that he's in your
[33:18] heart. If he's in your heart, let him be
[33:20] used. Use what's in your heart.
[33:26] I think about Hannah. And Hannah's a
[33:28] type of the church. her husband Elana,
[33:32] amen, loved her dearly. Loved her better
[33:35] than the other one. And we find out,
[33:37] amen, the other one was having children
[33:39] and she had none. But Hannah was
[33:41] desperate. Come on. We look at it. The
[33:44] the denomination of children. Uh uh they
[33:47] fill it up. They fill it up. She didn't
[33:50] ask for a whole lot. She just wanted a
[33:51] son. You see what I'm saying? She wanted
[33:53] the seed and mean to be made manifest.
[33:58] Now, one thing Hannah, she didn't sit
[34:00] back like some of us do, we sit back and
[34:02] think, well, God is going to do it. No
[34:05] sir, desperation struck her. She went
[34:08] into prayer. She went into fasting. She
[34:10] cried out unto the Lord till she came
[34:13] out speaking in tongues.
[34:17] She was jabbering yet, but that was what
[34:19] God had. Listen, if you are bride, there
[34:23] must be a inspiration on you right now.
[34:26] Amen.
[34:29] A inspiration that's moving you, that's
[34:32] driving you and making you know I cannot
[34:35] be satisfied in the condition that I'm
[34:38] in. There's something more for me and I
[34:41] got to have it. Hallelujah. Oh, how can
[34:44] you be satisfied? Amen. Hannah said,
[34:47] "No, sir." Said, "I know God have to
[34:50] have something for me." She cried out to
[34:52] the Lord. She cried out to the Lord.
[34:55] Amen. And then she had to pass Eli away.
[34:57] And Eli looked at her and said, "Oh my,
[35:00] you know what? What's what's been going
[35:01] on with you? You drunk and staggering
[35:03] like that. You you surely what's wrong?"
[35:06] She said, "No, Lord. I'm not like the
[35:08] daughters of Baal. I'm not like the
[35:10] daughters of Blayia. I want you to
[35:11] understand I have a petition."
[35:15] You say, "Well, brothers, are you out of
[35:17] your mind?" Maybe I am. If I got to jump
[35:19] and shout, Amen to pray to get his
[35:22] attention. Hello. Yeah, people say,
[35:24] "Well, uh, that's what I tried to tell
[35:26] you. Not only is this church is being
[35:29] attacked by the enemy of God, every
[35:32] church I've gone to, I can remember by
[35:34] the grace of God when the these churches
[35:37] that believe this word was on fire."
[35:39] Come on, somebody. Amen. Gifts and
[35:41] everything else being made manifest.
[35:43] Then that brother, Amen, brought out
[35:45] that uh uh quote uh uh uh uh Holy Ghost
[35:48] without sensation. That's all they read.
[35:50] They didn't read the rest of it, but
[35:52] they just read that and they killed the
[35:54] church. Okay, that's too much stuff.
[35:56] Okay, that's too much emotion. That's
[35:58] too much this. Look at them now. Now
[36:01] look at them. They're in a place they
[36:03] don't even want to believe is true
[36:04] anymore. Come on, somebody. Hallelujah.
[36:07] But brother call this message the Holy
[36:09] Ghost message. Hallelujah. This is the
[36:12] message that brings you into the context
[36:14] of God. Hallelujah. Come on, somebody.
[36:17] And look at them. They've been there.
[36:19] Amen. not knowing their mate. And what
[36:21] has happened now? They're now rotten
[36:23] eggs right there in church dying and
[36:26] rotten and welding up, smelling and
[36:29] think stinking in the nostril of God
[36:31] because all they giving him is religion.
[36:34] Come on, somebody. All they giving him
[36:36] rel God don't want religion. He's got
[36:38] that everywhere. God want to see his
[36:40] image. God want to see his likeness. God
[36:43] want to say that's good all over again.
[36:48] Hallelujah. People are afraid right now.
[36:51] So many people can't even get the Holy
[36:53] Ghost because they're afraid they going
[36:54] to speak in tongues. So what?
[36:58] Amen. You ought to get out of yourself.
[37:01] Hallelujah. You ought to get out of
[37:03] yourself. You ought to come to a place
[37:05] Hallelujah. You don't you lose yourself
[37:07] and you don't know what's going on.
[37:10] Amen.
[37:12] Hallelujah. What would have happened?
[37:13] Amen. To my brother Titus who's gone on
[37:15] to glory. Amen. And I saw the Holy Ghost
[37:17] fall on him in church. I was preaching
[37:19] the the quickening of the seed and how
[37:22] that God can give you the Holy Ghost
[37:23] right now in your seat. He believed it.
[37:26] The Holy Ghost stuck him right. Come
[37:28] down on him in service. He began to
[37:30] speak in tongues. What if I have went
[37:32] over there? Amen. Said, "Hold up,
[37:33] brother. You need an interpreter."
[37:37] What if I have done that? Was it a month
[37:39] later, Sister Ruby? Shorter than that,
[37:42] perhaps he was gone on the glory. Nobody
[37:45] knew he was going to die. Hallelujah.
[37:48] But God is faithful.
[37:52] God is faithful.
[37:54] Hallelujah. You don't know who the the
[37:56] next moment for the person. You got to
[37:58] let go and let God. Hallelujah. Some
[38:01] people don't even know the difference
[38:02] between Amen. A baby's babbling and a
[38:05] child speaking.
[38:09] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. And when
[38:11] you are truly exercising the gift of
[38:14] God, Amen. Cuz I possess both. I don't
[38:16] say that to brag.
[38:20] But God has used me in both.
[38:22] So I know the difference between a
[38:24] babbling and a speaking.
[38:29] But you got preachers, they so scared of
[38:30] it, they don't know what's what.
[38:32] Hallelujah. And I guess we're beyond
[38:34] that.
[38:36] Yes, we are. That's why we're in the
[38:38] condition we are in right now. We done
[38:41] shut the Holy Ghost out again.
[38:44] People in this message,
[38:48] we don't want all that fanaticism.
[38:51] Like our brother Keith said, that's not
[38:53] fanaticism. That's election. Hallelujah.
[38:56] Hallelujah. It ain't fanaticism. I'm
[38:58] elected. I can't help but do what I do.
[39:06] People look at me crazy cuz I'm
[39:08] emotional. I I shout and I dance and I
[39:10] praise God. Just like I said the other
[39:12] night, I'm not trying to get nobody in
[39:14] here to worship like a black man. I
[39:16] ain't even trying to get the black man
[39:17] to worship like a black man. Cuz what
[39:18] kind of stuff is that?
[39:22] I just want the Holy Ghost to move.
[39:26] Yeah. I don't care if you can keep beat
[39:28] or you can't keep beat. Let God work it.
[39:33] Let God work it. Amen.
[39:37] People say they all ain't all in
[39:39] worship. But I tell you what, the Bible
[39:40] said he inhabits the praise of his
[39:42] people. So if he going to be there, I
[39:43] want to do it. Amen. Well, I don't feel
[39:46] like it. You There's a sacrifice in
[39:48] there, too. How many times you come to
[39:50] church feeling down and tired and all of
[39:51] a sudden you raise your hand, something
[39:53] strike you? Hallelujah. Now, you in the
[39:55] presence of the almighty God. He weigh
[39:58] you by your actions.
[40:00] You don't have to prove nothing to me.
[40:02] God is trying you right now. He's
[40:04] weighing you by your actions.
[40:09] No, it's true. You go places even the
[40:12] sisters can't even hallelujah no more.
[40:14] You listen to those tapes of William
[40:15] Brown, you find out there's more
[40:16] hallelujah and screams on the tape by
[40:18] women than men.
[40:20] Hallelujah. Now it's just the opposite.
[40:23] Come on, somebody. Oh my. If I could get
[40:26] a couple of Miriams in here, a couple of
[40:28] Annas in here. Come on, somebody. Amen.
[40:31] We could have some church.
[40:35] How you going to tell me how to praise
[40:37] my God? I'm I'm feeling it this morning,
[40:39] folks. Honestly, I'm feeling it this
[40:41] morning. Amen. Because I know he's here.
[40:43] You know what Hannah did? She couldn't
[40:46] She couldn't care. Oh, her husband said,
[40:47] "But don't you know I love you? I love
[40:49] you, Hannah. Even though you haven't had
[40:50] any ch, I love you more." She wasn't
[40:52] satisfied. She wasn't s I can't be a
[40:55] fruitless tree. Amen. I got to be a tree
[40:58] that's going to bring forth fruit.
[41:00] Hallelujah. And that's the way she
[41:02] looked at it. I got to bring forth
[41:04] fruit. I got to let them let them know
[41:07] I'm blessed.
[41:09] Right? Because in that day, if a woman
[41:10] didn't have a child, Amen. she was
[41:12] considered cursed.
[41:14] She said, "I got to let them know."
[41:16] Amen. Not just your words, Lord is good.
[41:19] Yes, I I I am predestinated. I I I'm
[41:23] elected, but I I got to bring forth some
[41:25] fruit. I got to be pregnantated with
[41:27] this thing. I got to let people know
[41:30] that Jesus Christ lived.
[41:33] It ain't enough. It ain't enough to be
[41:36] the chosen wife. Hallelujah. I got to
[41:39] bring forth another generation.
[41:41] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[41:44] Hallelujah. And what Hannah, that's what
[41:47] I love about it. And then when Hannah
[41:49] had this child, she just didn't hand it
[41:52] over to God. Oh my. She wait till the
[41:55] child was weaned off the milk.
[42:00] She wasn't going to give him just a
[42:01] baby. Come on, somebody. Oh Lord, put me
[42:05] in the service, but not too soon. Put me
[42:07] in after I've been weaned from the milk.
[42:09] Hallelujah. Amen. When I can hear the
[42:12] voice of a prophet. Come on, somebody. I
[42:14] can receive instructions from a prophet.
[42:16] Hallelujah. That's what he did. She put
[42:19] Samuel, Amen, under the ministry of Eli.
[42:22] Hallelujah. and he wasn't all right.
[42:25] Come on, somebody. Amen. But God knew
[42:27] what he was doing. He was raising up a
[42:30] greater people, a greater nation.
[42:33] Hallelujah. A people, amen, that was
[42:35] under the true inspiration. And this one
[42:37] thing I love about Samuel, he was able
[42:40] to hear the voice of God. Hallelujah. A
[42:43] people that predestinated,
[42:45] Amen. to hear the voice of God.
[42:48] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying
[42:50] this morning? Amen. She didn't get an
[42:52] ordinary child, but she got a chosen
[42:55] one, an elected one, a prophet.
[43:02] Probably God didn't labor
[43:05] in this day for another church. He
[43:08] labored for the bride.
[43:11] And what is a bride? Is the bride a
[43:13] prophet? She is a prophetist. Thou must
[43:16] prophesy again. Oh, come on, somebody.
[43:19] Amen. She knows what he wants done with
[43:23] the word. Now that's the truth. You know
[43:26] the thing about it is brother sisters, I
[43:29] will not be stand before God being
[43:32] guilty of not trying to get you to the
[43:34] Holy Ghost.
[43:36] Prophet that's what was wrong with a lot
[43:39] of the churches. They're not getting
[43:40] them to Christ. Why are people
[43:42] backsliding right now? Why are they
[43:44] giving up? Come on, somebody. They ain't
[43:46] got enough. Hallelujah. You said, "Well,
[43:49] brother, I still come to church. That
[43:50] don't mean nothing. You could be
[43:52] backsliding right in your seat."
[43:54] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. That's
[43:56] what the Lord showed me. Yeah. Last
[43:58] year, there'll be many people
[44:00] backsliding right in their seats, yet
[44:02] attending church out of ritualistic
[44:04] reasons.
[44:07] You You don't You don't impress me. It's
[44:09] about God. He's weighing your actions.
[44:12] Is that all right? He's weighing your
[44:15] actions. Now, the same spirit was in
[44:18] Abraham is in the seed of Abraham and
[44:20] you believe God. That makes it hard on
[44:23] the preacher that don't believe in
[44:25] divine healing. But that's what the
[44:27] Bible said. And when you become a son of
[44:29] God, I take the nature of my father
[44:32] because I am his son. Hallelujah.
[44:38] Y'all know what I'm saying? Amen. I
[44:40] never wanted to be like my natural
[44:42] daddy. But guess what? It wasn't my
[44:45] choice.
[44:48] There were things he did I did.
[44:51] Did I want to do them? No. But it was in
[44:54] there. I took the nature of my natural
[44:57] father. Now you see I I'm looking at
[45:00] some of y'all and y'all, oh, I done
[45:01] heard this before. Okay, you have. But
[45:03] how you living it? That's the point.
[45:05] Hearing one thing with your head and
[45:07] your heart is two different things.
[45:09] Living it
[45:11] is what I'm speaking about. Amen. Like I
[45:13] said, you say we love God and we can't
[45:15] even love one another. Like I said, when
[45:18] we close the door, shut down the
[45:19] service, everybody races off to their
[45:21] own little destiny. Clicks here and
[45:23] click there is such a small assembly.
[45:25] Nonsense. A house divided cannot stand.
[45:29] There is no way for us to move on until
[45:32] there's unity here.
[45:36] Forget about your your the agendas and
[45:39] all of the things you think that are so
[45:40] important to you. Like I said, the most
[45:42] important to you uh people of God should
[45:45] be the body of Jesus Christ. Is that
[45:48] right? They came to Jesus said, "Lord,
[45:51] your mothers, your brothers, your
[45:52] sisters are here out here waiting to
[45:53] hear." He said, "Who is my mother? My
[45:55] brother, my sister, but those that do
[45:57] the will of God." Hallelujah. He exalted
[46:00] the family of God. Amen. Above his own
[46:03] natural family. And you're not there
[46:05] until you get there. Amen.
[46:09] We've got to care for one another. It's
[46:12] not a, you know, the Bible said if you
[46:13] can't love the brother who you see, how
[46:15] can you say you love the one who God who
[46:17] you never seen? Come on. The Bible said
[46:19] if you say that you're a liar, you and I
[46:22] must love one another. And I'm not
[46:24] talking about with some kind of some
[46:25] kind of hilio love. I'm talking about
[46:28] agape love. Amen.
[46:33] Is that all right? Amen.
[46:36] And when you become a son, you take the
[46:37] nature of your father. I am his son. And
[46:39] Abraham believed God and received the
[46:41] circumcision as a seal of the promise
[46:43] that that was to come. And now we have
[46:47] received the promise itself, the baptism
[46:49] of the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Spirit
[46:51] dwelling in the man makes him a son of
[46:53] God. But when we going to believe it,
[46:57] when are we going to take this to heart
[46:59] and say, "I am a son of God."
[47:03] Can I get you to say that? Those those
[47:05] who are daughters, you say daughters
[47:07] now. I am a son of God.
[47:11] Oh, y'all surely convinced me. Ah, I am
[47:15] so convinced.
[47:18] You didn't even convince yourself.
[47:21] Let's do that again. I am I am a son of
[47:24] God.
[47:26] That's right. And when the devil try to
[47:28] tell you not to remember that or or say
[47:30] those things when he comes to you, I
[47:33] don't care if you just slip and fell,
[47:35] you stand up and say, "But I am a son of
[47:38] God." Hallelujah. Why? Because he's
[47:41] declared me and you to be sons and
[47:43] daughters of God. Amen. Oh yes. It's
[47:46] already won. The victory is already won.
[47:49] The price is already paid. But God still
[47:52] is weigh in your actions. You say you
[47:54] bride that something's got to be
[47:55] turnurning on the inside of you right
[47:57] now. Something that want more of him.
[48:01] Hallelujah.
[48:03] Abraham took God word as pro as as as as
[48:05] the impossible till it was made
[48:08] possible. Huh? God going to bring
[48:10] impossible things to you. Things that
[48:12] look impossible.
[48:14] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Habits
[48:17] and things that been with you almost all
[48:19] your life, but God says it's possible.
[48:22] Amen.
[48:24] Amen.
[48:28] Come on, somebody. God says it's
[48:30] possible not by human effort, by the
[48:33] power of the Holy Ghost. But that that's
[48:36] what I love about John. Oh my. John said
[48:40] he he that's coming out for me. Amen.
[48:44] Hallelujah. I baptize you with water,
[48:46] but he that comes out for me shall
[48:48] baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[48:51] Not only but Holy Ghost and fire.
[48:56] People don't want the fire. Send down
[48:59] the fire, Lord. Send down the fire. Burn
[49:03] all these demons away from your people.
[49:06] Hallelujah.
[49:08] Hallelujah.
[49:09] Holy Ghost and fire.
[49:14] You say, "I got the fire."
[49:17] The only person that don't move. And I'm
[49:19] going to tell you something. If you if
[49:20] the fire is hot enough, you dead. Amen.
[49:23] It'll make you snap, crackle, and pop.
[49:28] Come on. You going to make some noise
[49:30] one way or the other.
[49:33] And they look at people like me and say,
[49:34] "Oh, you just too Pentecostal." Think,
[49:36] "God, I ain't giving it up. Don't even
[49:38] think you going to take this from me. I
[49:40] ain't giving it up." But I'm too
[49:43] Pentecostal. Praise God. I ain't giving
[49:45] it up.
[49:47] I rather that accusation than anything
[49:49] else.
[49:55] He believe his word and every ground
[49:58] that you set setting over tonight is
[50:00] nothing else but the word of God made
[50:02] manifest. It isn't. It's where did he
[50:05] see he get the material to make it with.
[50:08] Where did he come from? God spoke his
[50:10] word and believed his word. Abraham took
[50:13] God's word as as the impossible till it
[50:16] was made possible. Mary the virgin took
[50:19] God at the word at his word and the
[50:21] impossible was made possible. The whole
[50:23] course of life was changed and she
[50:26] brought forth a baby knowing no man
[50:28] because she took God at his word. And if
[50:31] anybody will take God at his word, his
[50:34] word shall ma be made manifest. Amen. If
[50:37] the seed falls on the right kind of a
[50:40] ground, it will produce exactly what is
[50:44] said to do.
[50:49] It'll do it. We don't have to worry
[50:52] about it. Oh my. Hallelujah. You get
[50:56] some corn seeds and you plant them. You
[50:58] don't have to worry about if it's gonna
[50:59] bring forth corn. It's a corn seed.
[51:02] Amen.
[51:03] Ah, if God is in you, you don't have to
[51:05] worry about it. He's going to bring
[51:07] forth of his own kind.
[51:11] Hallelujah. Second Peter 1:4 says,
[51:13] "Whereby we are given unto us
[51:16] exceedingly exceeding great and precious
[51:19] promises." Anybody know God ever
[51:21] breaking a promise, not one time?
[51:24] Hallelujah. That by these ye might be
[51:27] partakers of his divine nature.
[51:30] Hallelujah. He made the promise.
[51:32] Abraham's covenant. Come on, somebody.
[51:34] It ain't what you do, Abraham. It's what
[51:37] I've already done for you. I'm going to
[51:39] make this thing happen. I'm going to
[51:41] cause you to triumph. I'm going to make
[51:44] you more than a conqueror.
[51:49] So many people, so many Christians go
[51:51] down to the grave because they get sick,
[51:52] maybe with cancer or something like
[51:54] that, and the devil say, "Aha, I got
[51:56] you. Oh my, you're going to have to die
[51:59] from something." This body going to go
[52:01] down to the grave with something. Even
[52:03] if you call it natural death, I'll say
[52:04] it like this. It was so natural your
[52:06] heart stopped beating,
[52:08] right? You going to go down with
[52:10] something. But when you go down,
[52:12] Hallelujah. And you got the fire of God
[52:14] on the inside. Hallelujah. Just like
[52:17] that fire rested on Elijah's bones, it
[52:19] rests on yours. That's why the Bible
[52:22] said, "If that same spirit that was in
[52:24] Christ Jesus, if it be in you as he
[52:26] quickened his body, it'll also quicken
[52:29] yours.
[52:30] Hallelujah. Who you going to trust this
[52:32] morning? Amen. The world council of
[52:34] church has come after you. Who you going
[52:35] to trust?
[52:37] Hallelujah. He said, "Denounce this
[52:39] Jesus Christ or else." You going to have
[52:42] to say, "You take the or else cuz I
[52:43] ain't taking
[52:46] Jesus." Hallelujah. Praise God. I'm
[52:49] standing with him. Divine healing. Amen.
[52:52] You think about it. Amen. Come on. You
[52:55] You either believe it or you don't. The
[52:57] point is, Amen. A lot of time we want
[52:58] God to work like a microwave.
[53:00] Hallelujah. And you know what? In our
[53:02] day and age, you've heard me say this so
[53:04] many times. We don't even have patience
[53:05] with the microwave. It's the fastest
[53:07] cooking oven there is.
[53:10] And we'll put it on 60 seconds and we're
[53:13] there unpatiently, not even patient to
[53:16] wait on a minute.
[53:18] We're looking in the glass.
[53:20] Anybody know what I'm talking about?
[53:22] I've been there. You're looking into the
[53:24] microwave to see whether it's done yet.
[53:26] It's not even 60 seconds, but it ain't.
[53:29] Is it? Is it? Is it? Then you open it
[53:30] up. Ding. It ain't done
[53:34] cuz you open it up, put it back in
[53:36] there, click it again. Normally, it
[53:39] takes you more time cuz it took you a
[53:41] few seconds to open it and close it.
[53:44] But that's the training of the devil.
[53:48] Forgive me, but I'm going to say science
[53:50] is against us. It teaches us impatience.
[53:55] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Oh, we're in
[53:57] a generation we don't have to do nothing
[53:59] anymore.
[54:02] We've got even a washing machine that'll
[54:04] wash our clothes. Anybody know what I'm
[54:06] talking about? In my day, you had to use
[54:08] the tub.
[54:11] Huh? And now we almost don't even have
[54:13] patience with the washing machine.
[54:17] Want to shorten the cycles. Y'all hear
[54:20] what I'm saying? But that's the enemy
[54:23] building impatience in you. You don't
[54:26] even know it's working on you. You think
[54:28] it's okay when it's not.
[54:30] It's not okay. Amen. When you want to
[54:32] rush the red light, it's not okay.
[54:38] Because that's the enemy working
[54:40] impatience in you. The Bible said, "Do
[54:42] no nothing in haste."
[54:45] Come on, somebody. Just give me a more a
[54:48] little bit more now because I want you
[54:49] to know I cannot I cannot I cannot I
[54:54] cannot disbelieve God's word.
[54:59] I cannot see why because he's in me. If
[55:03] that seed be in you, it cannot sin. I
[55:07] cannot disbelieve because he and I have
[55:10] become one. Though my flesh trips me at
[55:13] times, it's faulty. It is a condemned
[55:17] house but my soul say yes to the word
[55:20] because otherwise that's what make me
[55:23] repent. That's what ask why I say
[55:25] forgive me Lord. Amen. Because my soul
[55:29] know what's right.
[55:32] Is that okay? Now we're looking at this
[55:35] thing because I want you to understand.
[55:37] Amen. That if you if you truly born
[55:39] again you overcometh the world. And the
[55:43] Bible said, "This is the victory that
[55:45] overcometh the world, even our faith."
[55:48] You got to have faith. You got to have
[55:50] faith. You got to have his faith inside
[55:53] of you.
[55:58] Like I said, how many of y'all us would
[56:01] have stood like Mary? How many of y'all
[56:03] would we would have stood like Mary? We
[56:05] look at Mary and she's so holy and this
[56:07] and that, but Mary was a woman, a young
[56:09] girl. Amen. She's called, Amen. to go to
[56:12] Bethlehem. Amen. In her last trimester,
[56:16] her last moments just prior, amen, to
[56:19] her giving birth on a donkey.
[56:25] Healy, rocky, stinky. Come on. All of
[56:30] the other people, y'all know what I'm
[56:31] talking about. The dust field air. How
[56:34] can God be in this?
[56:39] How can God be in this? How can God be
[56:42] in your trials? Some of y'all have
[56:44] trials you can't even understand it. Why
[56:47] me, Lord? Why not you? Hallelujah. You
[56:51] want to be perfected. He's the
[56:53] perfector. Amen. He knows what to take
[56:56] you through. Hallelujah. He knows the
[56:58] trials that you can withstand.
[57:02] God always do unusual things. You can't
[57:06] ever figure him out. Don't even try it.
[57:08] You can just only believe him and take
[57:10] him at his word. He put you through
[57:12] these trials. God knows. I've looked
[57:14] back and I thought to myself, "Oh my
[57:16] God, what have I ever done to deserve
[57:18] some of these things?" But let me tell
[57:19] you something, people of God. There's
[57:21] always somebody worse than you. Amen.
[57:25] And don't let the devil make you feel
[57:27] like you've done evil.
[57:30] Think it not strange when drivers
[57:32] temptation come upon you, knowing that
[57:34] the trying of your faith is more
[57:35] precious than gold. You have prayed.
[57:38] You've desired God to make you whole, to
[57:41] make you just like him. But there's no
[57:43] way you can ever get there without your
[57:45] own Calvary. Amen. You got to suffer.
[57:50] Ain't nothing wrong with you.
[57:53] That's the devil's lie. It really is the
[57:56] devil's lie.
[57:59] The devil done told you all those
[58:01] things. If we can believe God like you
[58:03] believe in the devil, you'll be a
[58:04] superman, a superwoman. Right?
[58:08] With the super god on the inside, lift
[58:11] up your head. Why? He said that in this
[58:13] day. Lift up your head. When you see the
[58:16] coming of the Lord, lift up your head.
[58:17] Don't you be sad. Don't be looking down.
[58:20] It's a finished work. Lift up your head.
[58:28] Hallelujah.
[58:30] Like I said, you don't know who all
[58:32] going to be saved. And for those loved
[58:34] ones that don't be saved, God going to
[58:35] wipe the tears from your eyes. You won't
[58:37] even remember they ever existed.
[58:40] Heaven is going to be heaven. Yes, it
[58:43] will. Amen. Now, lot watch this. I'm
[58:45] going to read this and I'mma listen. But
[58:47] what I'm saying is if you're born
[58:49] supernatural, it makes you supernatural.
[58:53] Huh? But it takes a skilled hands. You
[58:56] know, like the prophet of God said, you
[58:57] know, it takes strong faith to hold this
[58:59] message. You see what I'm saying? It
[59:01] can't be something weak now. It's got to
[59:03] be strong. It's got to be strong faith
[59:05] to hold a sword. Y'all hear what I'm
[59:07] saying? Amen. It's not enough to have
[59:09] the the sword at the at the enemy's
[59:11] throat. But if if it's not strong, the
[59:13] enemy can knock that out the way. So,
[59:15] you got to have a strong hand at the
[59:17] enemy's throat in order to win this
[59:19] battle,
[59:21] right? He's going to try you in every
[59:24] way. He'll try you. But you got to be
[59:26] strong in faith. We have a strong
[59:28] victory. This bride ain't going want go
[59:30] out here whimpy. This bride is not going
[59:32] to barely make it. She's more than a
[59:35] conqueror. She'll laugh at death and and
[59:38] and and in the grave on her way up.
[59:43] H that's right. If Paul can laugh at
[59:45] him, which was the first church age,
[59:47] we'll laugh at him on the last one. Come
[59:49] on, somebody. Now watch this strain of
[59:51] man. The first thing is make man himself
[59:54] a religion. See, we don't want just a
[59:56] religion. a man, he he's got to have
[59:58] some kind of religion. Oh, I was talking
[1:00:00] to a famous man here in the city the
[1:00:02] other day and said, "You know my
[1:00:04] religion, uh, Brother Random is keeping
[1:00:06] the golden rules." That's good. But,
[1:00:08] brother, unless a man is born again, he
[1:00:11] will perish.
[1:00:12] Yes, sir. He's got to He's got to be
[1:00:15] born again. Not the golden rule is all
[1:00:19] right. That's a moral man can do that.
[1:00:22] But it's it's got to be all in the
[1:00:24] supernatural line.
[1:00:28] And you'll see what God had to do in
[1:00:30] order what he we in order that we could
[1:00:34] be supernaturally born. Now you mean to
[1:00:37] tell me that Jesus Christ is going to
[1:00:38] come to Calvary die and all of that
[1:00:41] raised from the dead. Amen. For us to be
[1:00:43] supernaturally born and then we come and
[1:00:45] let some teacher think make us think we
[1:00:47] don't have to be.
[1:00:50] Think about it. I want to ask you a
[1:00:52] question. Where would you be if you had
[1:00:54] to remember all the quotes?
[1:00:58] Now, I don't know about you, but I'm
[1:01:00] lost. If if that's what it's going to
[1:01:02] take, I'm lost.
[1:01:04] You You know, I know a brother right now
[1:01:06] who brought this message to me, who can
[1:01:08] quote books after books, who is now
[1:01:11] denying this prophet and the message.
[1:01:14] See, so it ain't that. Oh, I feel like
[1:01:17] running right now. Amen. Hey, if this
[1:01:19] pool pit wasn't in front of me, I would
[1:01:20] have been down the middle. I saw it. I
[1:01:22] It happened. You didn't see it, but he
[1:01:24] did it. Now, you look at this thing and
[1:01:26] I want you to understand. Amen. That
[1:01:28] ain't it. That's why God can take such
[1:01:32] dumb people like myself, put him spirit,
[1:01:34] his spirit in me, and cause me to appear
[1:01:37] like I'm something.
[1:01:39] Cuz it ain't me, it's him.
[1:01:42] You see what I'm saying? Now you look at
[1:01:44] this thing because listen, I find out
[1:01:46] that the more these people know all of
[1:01:49] these things, the more they go into some
[1:01:52] strange stuff.
[1:01:56] And you know what end up being? Some
[1:01:58] male dominating you.
[1:02:02] Hello. Some male dominating you because
[1:02:06] he can put it together better than you.
[1:02:10] Hello, somebody. But there ain't nothing
[1:02:12] but one male that's in my dominating me
[1:02:15] and that's the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. I
[1:02:17] thank God. I thank God. Hallelujah. For
[1:02:21] this message.
[1:02:24] I've got a lot of loved ones, different
[1:02:26] ones gone backwards. I said, "Lord, me
[1:02:28] and my wife was talking the other day
[1:02:30] said, you know, if I got a backslide,
[1:02:33] let me backslide, but don't never let me
[1:02:35] deny
[1:02:36] that this is true.
[1:02:39] Don't ever let me get there. Don't ever
[1:02:41] let me go there.
[1:02:45] Woo Jesus. No sir. Don't ever let me go
[1:02:49] there. Nobody have to prove nothing to
[1:02:52] me. I seen it with my own eyes. You see,
[1:02:54] because before I came to this message, I
[1:02:56] didn't know what the pillar of fire was.
[1:02:57] I didn't know what the pillar of cloud
[1:02:59] was. I didn't know what eyes are blind
[1:03:01] or be. I'd never seen that. I'd never
[1:03:02] seen the dead raised. I seen what this
[1:03:04] brings. The believing of the word and
[1:03:07] the faith in the word can do. Look what
[1:03:09] it did for me the other day. Look, look,
[1:03:10] look. Maybe you don't understand it, but
[1:03:12] it's true. Amen. When God does
[1:03:14] something, he didn't have to do it. He
[1:03:17] did it anyhow.
[1:03:20] One of these old days, the same word
[1:03:22] will change me and you into a place
[1:03:24] we're translating.
[1:03:28] Come on. There's got to be a
[1:03:29] magnetizing,
[1:03:31] a magnetizing to this word, a
[1:03:33] magnetizing to Jesus Christ. Y'all hear
[1:03:35] what I'm saying? If something is not
[1:03:37] like if you're not like a magnet yet,
[1:03:39] there's something that needs to make you
[1:03:40] a magnet. I think is electricity or
[1:03:43] something that makes magnets. I don't
[1:03:44] know how it is. Yes, you put electricity
[1:03:46] in it becomes a magnet. We need some
[1:03:48] electricity. Hallelujah. That's going to
[1:03:51] magnetize us. Do it till we read it,
[1:03:53] study it, pray it. Hallelujah. Live it
[1:03:55] most of all. Hallelujah. And how you
[1:03:57] going to know? You see, you'll know
[1:04:02] when true Christians comes in your
[1:04:04] presence, you know.
[1:04:07] Hallelujah. You don't look at all of the
[1:04:09] failures and the faults. Amen. You know,
[1:04:11] but when when a Christian comes in to
[1:04:13] your presence, if you truly a Christian,
[1:04:15] you know, don't you know there's
[1:04:17] somehow, even if a person is not even
[1:04:19] born again yet, you know where they
[1:04:21] elected. Something attracts you to them.
[1:04:23] Something that magnetize you to them
[1:04:25] like you know them already. Those are
[1:04:27] the kind of people you never give up on.
[1:04:29] You shouldn't never give up on anybody.
[1:04:31] But something about those people that
[1:04:33] you somehow are magnetized to. And I'm
[1:04:35] not talking about fleshly lust.
[1:04:40] See,
[1:04:43] there is there is a way that seemth
[1:04:44] right unto men, but the end thereof is
[1:04:47] the way of death. And every man that uh
[1:04:49] uh ungenerated of God will go that way
[1:04:52] of destruction. You can't help it. Your
[1:04:54] own soul guides you. If you're born
[1:04:57] again, you're bound to go up. If you're
[1:04:59] not born again, you got to go down.
[1:05:03] Is that anything to play with?
[1:05:08] I hope you're being blessed this
[1:05:09] morning. Amen. I hope you're being
[1:05:12] blessed this morning.
[1:05:14] You know, when it comes down to God,
[1:05:17] he's the only one that can germmitize
[1:05:19] the seed.
[1:05:24] And that's what a lot of people don't
[1:05:25] see. When a man is under the inspiration
[1:05:28] and he's preaching, that's God. That
[1:05:32] ain't man. That's God. That's the life
[1:05:34] coming out of his mouth that can
[1:05:36] germatize you. And a lot of time we miss
[1:05:39] it. We come right here not recognizing
[1:05:41] the presence of God. It ain't about
[1:05:44] shouting and screaming. Even though I
[1:05:45] love the amens. Come on somebody. Amen.
[1:05:48] It's not all about that. But are you
[1:05:50] receiving it? Cuz see, once that life
[1:05:52] comes in there, amen, it's more than
[1:05:55] head knowledge, it it transforms you.
[1:05:59] You can't help but to be who you are.
[1:06:01] You're not ashamed to be a Christian.
[1:06:04] Hallelujah. You're not ashamed of the
[1:06:05] word for the hour. Come on. How you Oh,
[1:06:08] come on, somebody. It's the truth. Just
[1:06:11] give me one more minute. I'm going to
[1:06:12] let you go.
[1:06:15] How many of y'all really believe that
[1:06:16] God is a miracle worker? You know,
[1:06:19] because I'm going to tell you something.
[1:06:20] The greatest miracle is this guy. You
[1:06:23] know, I I honestly I wish I could just
[1:06:25] sit back and I told my daughter, she
[1:06:27] likes to write. I said, you know, I
[1:06:28] would love to write a book. I'd love to
[1:06:30] write something. Amen. To let people
[1:06:32] know where I come from. I might give it
[1:06:35] another name.
[1:06:37] But, you know, I want people don't think
[1:06:39] people can People couldn't handle it,
[1:06:41] brothers. They couldn't handle where I
[1:06:43] came from.
[1:06:45] You know, cuz so many people y'all think
[1:06:47] y'all was wicked.
[1:06:49] Huh?
[1:06:50] And you're right.
[1:06:54] You were all of us. Huh? But I'm going
[1:06:58] to tell you something. God's still a
[1:06:59] healer. He's still a deliverer. You know
[1:07:02] what? And I look at this thing and now
[1:07:04] the Bible tells us this in Matthew 20.
[1:07:06] And I'm going to close on this. He's
[1:07:08] weighing you. Now, you say, "I, oh, I'm
[1:07:11] I'm I'm action. I'm I'm a believer."
[1:07:16] Where's your joy? Amen. I'm a believer.
[1:07:21] You got to pray. If you are, talk to
[1:07:23] him. I'm a believer.
[1:07:26] Then all things are possible. I'm a
[1:07:29] believer. I'm going to rejoice in the
[1:07:31] midst of sorrows. I'm a believer.
[1:07:35] I'm going to press. Amen.
[1:07:39] I'm more than a conqueror. He did it for
[1:07:42] me. Now, let me show you something which
[1:07:44] a lot of us miss.
[1:07:46] The Bible said with every temptation,
[1:07:49] God has already made the way of escape.
[1:07:54] Every temptation. So therefore, when
[1:07:57] you're missing something, when you are
[1:07:59] in a place, Amen. and you need to get
[1:08:02] out of this situation, guess what? It's
[1:08:06] already there.
[1:08:08] The doors are it's already open. He made
[1:08:11] the way of escape. You got to say, Lord,
[1:08:14] direct me. Show me the way of escape.
[1:08:17] Because what happens is Satan will make
[1:08:19] you feel like you in a maze. Right? In a
[1:08:23] maze. But when God don't care about what
[1:08:26] kind of maze you in, he know how to
[1:08:27] direct you out of it. Is that right? Oh,
[1:08:31] come on, somebody. There's nothing too
[1:08:32] hard for God.
[1:08:36] When no, when Moses them was backed up
[1:08:37] against the Red Sea, nobody looked like
[1:08:39] nobody knew which way God was going to
[1:08:41] have them go. God had already made the
[1:08:43] way. It wasn't that God thought, "Oh my
[1:08:45] God, I got to find a way of getting them
[1:08:47] people out of there." He had already
[1:08:48] made their way. And once that faith
[1:08:51] struck them, God then revealed the way
[1:08:54] to them. Already there. See that is when
[1:08:58] that faith is there, God will reveal to
[1:09:00] you how to get out of it. How to push
[1:09:03] through it, how to go to the next level.
[1:09:06] Come on, somebody. How to mature, how
[1:09:08] how to let him take you through
[1:09:11] suffering without you complaining. Amen.
[1:09:18] Ain't nothing wrong with none of us. You
[1:09:19] know what's happening? We just being
[1:09:21] tried and tested.
[1:09:23] Y'all understand what I mean by that?
[1:09:25] You're not cursed.
[1:09:27] Hallelujah. You're not of the devil.
[1:09:30] Hallelujah. That's a devil's lie.
[1:09:35] Huh? That's the devil's lie to make you
[1:09:37] think something's wrong. No, no, no, no.
[1:09:40] Everybody must go the way God determined
[1:09:43] them to go. And who going to say to the
[1:09:45] the man who made the clay, why did you
[1:09:47] make me? Who going to say to the man who
[1:09:49] makes the potter? Who? Why did you form
[1:09:51] me this way? Why did you fashion me this
[1:09:53] way? Are you going to grumble like that?
[1:09:56] You need to do I'm going to tell you
[1:09:57] something. If you had only one eye and
[1:09:58] one leg and one arm, you know, need to
[1:10:00] use the ones you got and praise him with
[1:10:02] it. Amen.
[1:10:05] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:10:08] Use what you got.
[1:10:10] that little lady there that was in
[1:10:11] Phantom Tabernacle who had been in that
[1:10:13] in that uh wheelchair all her life. God
[1:10:17] healed people all around her and yet and
[1:10:21] still God got glory out of her life. She
[1:10:24] wasn't complaining. Why didn't God give
[1:10:27] me face to walk? No. God set her there
[1:10:34] and she was probably made whole far more
[1:10:37] than those who walked out
[1:10:39] with arms and legs.
[1:10:43] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Being whole
[1:10:45] is being whole spiritually, not so much
[1:10:47] the natural. Being whole. Let's stand.
[1:10:51] I'm under this anointing. I can go for a
[1:10:53] while.
[1:10:55] Listen,
[1:11:00] don't you know that you even your heart
[1:11:03] can't be hardened
[1:11:05] unless God hardens it?
[1:11:09] God will harden your heart. Now,
[1:11:12] don't mean that he'll make it stay
[1:11:13] there, but he'll get you. He'll teach
[1:11:15] you a good lesson.
[1:11:21] You hear what I'm saying?
[1:11:24] The Bible tells us that Pharaoh tried to
[1:11:26] repent,
[1:11:28] God would harden his heart.
[1:11:32] Try to
[1:11:34] you and I don't want you don't want to
[1:11:35] go there. You want Amen. The moment you
[1:11:38] hear the word, you want to break before
[1:11:40] God and says, "Lord, forgive me."
[1:11:43] There's a supernatural thing that you
[1:11:45] and I must know that we've got to have,
[1:11:48] and that is Christ. That is God. Amen.
[1:11:50] you becoming him. People, it ain't about
[1:11:53] your job. It ain't about your future.
[1:11:56] Amen. How you going to become this in
[1:11:58] this world and this that and the other.
[1:12:00] You better focus.
[1:12:02] You better get yourself. Lord, help me
[1:12:04] focus. Let everything else become
[1:12:05] secondary.
[1:12:07] But my priorities got to be you. My
[1:12:11] priorities must be you. If you're not
[1:12:14] first, you're not at all. That's how God
[1:12:17] is. It's got to be God first in
[1:12:21] everything.
[1:12:23] Sure, you're going to make mistakes.
[1:12:26] Sure, you're going to falter at times,
[1:12:28] but that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:12:29] Christ is all about. You love God. Well,
[1:12:33] I hope by the grace of God, you feel a
[1:12:35] little encouraged. But I want to say
[1:12:37] this. If you don't remember nothing else
[1:12:39] that has been preached this morning, I
[1:12:40] want you to remember God weighs your
[1:12:44] action.
[1:12:48] That's what shows God whether you'll
[1:12:50] believe or not on how you act after
[1:12:54] hearing your word.
[1:12:57] Love the Lord. Let's pray. Father God,
[1:13:00] we come before you, Lord, as humbly as
[1:13:02] we know how. We thank you for your grace
[1:13:04] and your mercy. Lord, you've been better
[1:13:07] to us than we've been to ourselves.
[1:13:10] Father, we pray that you would just give
[1:13:11] us what we stand in need of.
[1:13:14] Lord, we know that there are some here
[1:13:16] who are not feeling well. Uh but I pray
[1:13:19] Lord that today, Lord, that you would
[1:13:22] touch their bodies. Lord, those who are
[1:13:24] battling with the flu and the cold,
[1:13:27] touch their bodies right now. God, those
[1:13:30] saints of God that have come all the
[1:13:32] way, Lord, from Iowa City down in that
[1:13:36] area. We pray that you touch them, Lord.
[1:13:38] We pray that you give them strength,
[1:13:40] Lord God, and give them a special
[1:13:42] blessing, Father, for pressing their way
[1:13:44] out, oh God, down here, Lord, in in in
[1:13:48] Iowa, Lord. I pray that you minister to
[1:13:51] them coming and going, Father. Lord God,
[1:13:54] we know how you love those who press and
[1:13:58] sacrifice uh themselves unto you, Lord.
[1:14:01] I pray that you bless them in a special
[1:14:03] way. Remember those my wife, Lord, who
[1:14:06] Satan is battling
[1:14:08] uh with uh sinuses and things of that
[1:14:11] nature. We you're still the healer.
[1:14:13] You're still God. And Lord, we speak
[1:14:15] healing and deliverance to her right
[1:14:17] now, Father. Oh God, we bind every evil
[1:14:20] spirit here in this morning. We bind
[1:14:23] every spirit of affliction. We speak
[1:14:25] healing and deliverance to each and
[1:14:27] every one of them, Lord, in your name,
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ. For thy name's sake, Lord.
[1:14:32] Not because of me, but because of your
[1:14:34] word. Do it for thy name's sake, Lord.
[1:14:37] And we'll be careful to give you the
[1:14:39] praise, glory, and honor in Jesus
[1:14:42] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:14:45] Maybe you never
[1:14:48] walk a day in sin.
[1:14:53] And
[1:14:55] you never
[1:14:57] lived a life so black that light
[1:15:03] couldn't enter in.
[1:15:09] And maybe he's never came at night to
[1:15:14] dry your eyes so swollen by the tears
[1:15:22] because of pain and sorrow.
[1:15:26] No hope of
[1:15:28] tomorrow
[1:15:30] down through the years.
[1:15:34] But he did it for me.
[1:15:38] Jesus did it for me.
[1:15:43] I can't help but praise him when I think
[1:15:48] of
[1:15:50] what I used to be.
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:57] He redeemed by his blood.
[1:16:02] I've been washed
[1:16:04] in his blood.
[1:16:07] He took my shame upon his back.
[1:16:13] Oh, the crimson flood.
[1:16:17] Now every time I hear God's word,
[1:16:22] something in my heart is stirred. I can
[1:16:26] feel God's praises rumbling in my soul.
[1:16:34] Yes, he did it for me.
[1:16:38] Jesus did it for me.
[1:16:42] I can't help but praise him when I think
[1:16:47] of what I think about it used to be.
[1:16:55] I've been redeemed by his grace.
[1:17:00] I've been washed
[1:17:02] in his blood.
[1:17:04] He took my shame upon his back.
[1:17:09] Oh, that crimson flood.
[1:17:13] Now every time I hear God's word,
[1:17:18] something in my heart is stirred. I can
[1:17:22] feel God's praises rumbling in my soul.
[1:17:28] My soul.
[1:17:31] My soul.
[1:17:33] Church, my soul. I can feel God's
[1:17:37] praises rumbling in my soul.
[1:17:44] That's the way it ought to be here
[1:17:45] tonight or this morning.
[1:17:47] Every time you hear God's word,
[1:17:50] something in your heart ought to be
[1:17:52] stirred.
[1:17:53] Amen. There's something about the name
[1:17:56] of Jesus
[1:17:57] is still precious to me.
[1:18:00] There is no other name given among men
[1:18:03] where we must be saved. I don't know if
[1:18:06] there's somebody even though we prayed.
[1:18:07] If you really want us to lay hands and
[1:18:09] pray for you, we'll do that. There's
[1:18:12] somebody, amen, who desire salvation,
[1:18:14] you know, we welcome you to come.
