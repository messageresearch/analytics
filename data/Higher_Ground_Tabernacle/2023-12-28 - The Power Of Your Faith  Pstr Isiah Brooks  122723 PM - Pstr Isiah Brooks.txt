before the New Years and uh with this in mind I trust that the message tonight will be a blessing to you okay Isaiah 96 and 7 we like to invite uh excuse me i' like to welcome all of the visitors home and if you are a Christian you are at home Isaiah 9 6-7 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and of the increase peace of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of host will perform this amen amen Isaiah 22 [Music] 2222 you there amen and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he he shall open and None Shall shut amen and he shall shut and None Shall open God let us pray dear heavenly father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for the mercies uh that you have given unto us we thank you for this time of worship praise and hearing of your word father give us Grace oh God to receive your word that it bring forth 100f life you be all the glory in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I entitled this message the power of your faith but I feel like it should have been entitled the mercies of of of of David uh we we we want to deal with that this evening but we we also want to to understand that no matter how much the Bible promis you if you don't believe it if you don't receive it it's not applicable to you you must apply it and this could only be the word can be applied only by faith now we are at the end of the journey and we know and realize that this is the last Church age there's not coming another the only the other the the age that uh comes after this is that Eternal age is the age of the Millennium but faith is the only thing that will get us out of here and we must understand that faith is the only thing that pleases God faith is not something that you can go buy from a store something that your preaching can give you the bible say that faith comes by the hearing hearing of the word of God it is a gift given to you by God the revelation of God in you is the unconditional Covenant of Abraham the unconditional Covenant of David and his seed it's is is is what we call an extending extended blessing the blessing remains with us the blessings holds us the blessings keep us like the Bible says it's not by power it's not by might but it's by my spirit say the Lord the thing that was happening with us now is that we are pretty much resting between revivals or at the end of Revival the the Pentecostal Church have had their great Revival and we know that when when the prophet of God was here was a great Revival but that Revival what we from we talk about what it used to be like and how God used to move but right now we must understand that the bride in herself must have a Revival now some people say that we are already in the bride's Revival and in some some expect that is true but the is of that that Revival brings you to a place this revival brings you to a place where you and I are in the very image of God every Revival before us could only give them a partiality of of an image the fullness of the image wasn't there even though the potential was there it was not yet time for it the seals had to be open is that right the son of man had to be on the earth the Thunders of God had to be unfolded and there had to be a bride that would receive seed that was planted Now understand this when the prophet of God was here he was sowing the seed but what the people were looking at they were looking at the seed as though it was a harvest Hallelujah it was not yet Harvest even though he preached the Harvest the Harvest was somewhat prophetic because there was a CR that was to come Hallelujah bilig sold his seed so his seed now we see those seeds manifested Hallelujah William Bram saw his seed Mal sold his seed was not his seed he only sold the seed of God it wasn't a hybrid seed it wasn't a mixed seed it was a pure seed of God we must understand Hallelujah when that seed was swn it was on good ground hallah in this generation The Pride will bring forth 100f this will bring for 100 because she had a pure word a whole seed not a half seed not a seed tampered by man hallu SE that God sld and what did he do he came to extend the blessings of David Hallelujah am and I tried to tell you this in just a moment remember he preached a message testimony on the sea during that time everybody was talking about the Revival what they just had with Jesus you see what I'm saying the walk the dumb talk the Blind and why why Christ slept in the boat came hallelu amen and the disciples that was in the boat forgot that Jesus was on the inside somehow they forgot who he was Hallelujah so when the storm increased y'all better hear what I'm saying when the storm increased seemed like they were blinded to their commission y'all hear what I'm saying because they were commissioned Hallelujah to pray for the sick dead to preach the gospel and and and he told them that every demon would be subject to them even so if you should drink any deadly things it shall not harm you Hallelujah we as Believers know that the Devil comes to steal and destroy Hallelujah so anything that comes your way to kill you to steal from you or to destroy you it's nothing but the devil and if you that you can have the I sight to see the enemy a far off you can then stand your position position Hallelujah and speak to the storm the stor must obey Hallelujah because when that storm increased the sails broke the ORS broke water start coming into the ship Jesus went and I mean Peter went and shook Jesus and woke him up but that's the truth if he's asleep your boat you need to wake him up Hallelujah shook him and said car thou not that we perish Hallelujah let me tell you about my God he never sleep no he Slumber Hallelujah they were looking at a man he was more than a man Hallelujah and when they awakened him the Bible said he stood on the H of the boat spoke to the and he said just a few words he said peace be still Hallelujah you see those things were actions and they were receiving the blessings of David y'all better hear what I'm saying he was called the son of David Hallelujah And that son of David carried the blessings of David Hallelujah but this was not just the son of David Hallelujah this was the son of God it wasn't just the Son of God he was God hallelujah and when the storm ceased they said to themselves what kind of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey brother said they got it wrong he said they had it wrong no man can stop the sea no man can stop the win was God in the man Hallelujah he was more than a man because God was in him and the Bible said in him the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell move on you got to have faith and what's moving our way now will require perfect Faith what we're going to embrace in 2024 we have no idea we don't know what that kind of a darkness is hallelujah when the whole world it has become lawlessness and they work by the imagination of their mind Hallelujah the only light left in this world is the bride of Christ the only in the only sness in this world are those chosen to be lights of the world Hallelujah but the good part about this we don't have to worry we don't have to frat Hallelujah because the Bible said the Zeal of the Lord of host will perform this hallelujah oh yes when we talk about the government and y'all know how it is when women when y'all get married y'all take that ve and you put that Veil on that man's shoulder that means he's your your government and you are relinquishing your headship and you're transferring your headship over to him and he is saying in receiving it I will take care of you I'm going to protect you Hallelujah I will see that you have no need for anything is that the truth the Bible said he will supply your needs now you he can't Supply your needs if you don't believe he can Faith is the only thing that moves God if you believe his word he would fulfill his word amen I may have testified of this before but I grew up pretty poor my mother was illiterate couldn't read nor right but she was a Christian and there were times we would come short when it comes to food Hallelujah but I could remember one day because my mama knew I love to eat and she said Junior don't worry about it God show me he's going to supply our needs God will bring some kind of somehow God will bring some food I know this might sound crazy to some of you but it was I was getting ready to go outside play and when I went outside there on the back porch was about three to four bags of groceries Hallelujah it was one of the first Miracles I seen my mom spoke it and and to this very day we I never knew who brought the grocery hallelujah amen you know a little story that this one man was was uh making fun of this Christian almost in the same like man she needed some some groceries of some sort and the man heard the Christian praying and he said I'm going to fix her I'm going to go and buy some groceries and I'm going to knock on her door and give her the grocery and so when he knocked on the door to give her the groceries she said praise the Lord praise God for bringing me Fe this grocery he said God didn't do that he said I did it she said the devil might have brought it but God sent it Hallelujah that's right see it God will provide is that right come on it's the truth God uses the devil sometimes Hallelujah yes when that woman was caught in adultery that woman to Jes [Music] Hallelujah that's all I'm saying case dismiss oh when you think about it God's Mercy is upon the House of David it ought to make you want to dance because David amen he he he he he defeated his enemy in so many you know I mean he may have lost a few battles but he won Hallelujah and the thing about this it's free we don't have to pay for it hallelujah amen amen we're not like all the others bring all your money bring all your money you can't pay for salvation Hallelujah amen it's free Hallelujah Isaiah 55 1-3 Hallelujah yes sir that's what people think you know even some sometimes relatives help you out they don't want to but they answering the prayers ex that's right hallelujah it's nothing but the truth Isaiah 55 1-3 so all everyone that thirth Come Ye to the waters and he that have no money Come Ye buy and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfy not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness incline your ears and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David I love David like David was a man after God's Own Heart he was able to make mistakes but he always made things right Hallelujah and even when he didn't want to make it right God forced the issue Hallelujah somebody better hear what I'm saying if you are the bride of Christ you are under the mercies of David you can't hide from God God will force the issue Hallelujah why because God said I have have not lost one Hallelujah word is that right yall know the story B Shea but that's the grace of God he tried to hide and God sent a Prophet by his house even in David's judgment he was wise enough to know that he did not want to fall into the hands of man I got to have judgment the Judgment of God because in the Judgment of God I can receive Mercy I can receive Grace Hallelujah but when man wants to judge you he'll send you to hell when he himself need to be there it's the truth amen it's so amazing how that people don't know how to give Mercy mercies and Grace to their loved ones even to their enemies when God gave us mercy and Grace when we were his enemies before you became saved before you became a Christian you was the enemy of God and God even when you was a sinner gave you grace and mercy that's the only reason why we're here yes sir Hallelujah the mercies of the Lord is extended to the House of David whether be jew Gentile or Greek all mankind Hallelujah it used to be just to the Jews but since Calvary it's to the whole world than you Lord whosoever believeth in me though he would there yet shall he live Hallelujah I'm feeling good tonight Hallelujah Luke please Luke 126 28 I've got to tie this verses of David into Jesus Christ yes it's amazing luke6 Luke 28 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth now let me tell you something about Nazareth the name Nazareth means to be separated crowned and Sanctified but when Jesus came it was wicked Hallelujah so much so when the disciples heard that Jesus came out of Nazareth he said can any good thing come out of Nazareth Hallelujah but there was a good thing Hallelujah you were in Nazareth Hallelujah come on somebody but the point is I can't express you know I mean the thing is there was a virgin espoused to be a man to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the Virgin name was Mary got to hear what I'm saying because this the mercies and Grace travel hundreds of years Through Time a B on a man named Joseph and a woman named Mary we've celebrated this Christmas thing you got to realize what was taking place God was positionally placing his seed hallel to make change in the world y hear what I'm saying blood of Jesus Christ is not here just to be another church she came here to bring change Hallelujah every time God did a major move it was to bring a change whether it be good or evil God always bring change Hallelujah now we in the Bible says and the angel came unto her and said Hail Mary thou that are highly favored is that right and the prophet of God said we're liken unto Mary Hallelujah so you must understand you are highly favor he said the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women Hallelujah and as I preached on Sunday brought forth a child which means that the of God's bread she comes out of Nazareth with a bad reputation she had there even no matter how Wicked the world is somebody help me here but in this light it is a church God is producing and the same Christ Jesus that was born in a Manger as a baby must be born in the manger of your heart but once he's born he doesn't stay a baby he grows he mates Hallelujah he gets to the place where he's able to rightly divide the scriptures is that right because even at the age of 12 Jesus was preaching to the sadu could understand his widom because his wisdom wasn't given to him by man a theology school a do of divinity the thing he had that they didn't have was that God was his father with the bride of Christ have a teacher Holy Ghost he is the one that gives us Revelation the one that gives us understanding when we speak blesss Hallelujah Luke Luke 1 67- 73 I try not to scream but I can't help it I know my English is very hard for you to understand when I get in that mode but I try I'm a junkie when it comes to the anointing oh my goodness praise the Lord for his goodness St Luke 13 and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he have visited and redeemed his [Music] people and have raised up an Horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which he have since the world began Hallelujah now now here it is I think it's in in Genesis 3:18 it talks about the seed your seed shall bruise the head and his seed shall BR and what was it prophesying of we we didn't know that that seed would be called the son of David we had no idea here the scriptures is taking us back he said this thing has been spoken by the holy prophets since the world Isaiah spoke of him Enoch preached about it y'all hear what I'm saying it just never ends it's from Genesis ration you can find Jesus Christ in the word want to look at it he's in there Hallelujah is that right Noah he was in Noah was in Moses Hallelujah that same life Hallelujah though it be imparted Hallelujah that's what the scripture said that what was done in part is done away with why because we've got the full love Hallelujah we got the whole thing we're not boasting it's reality hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord they hated Jesus because when he said I and the father one they thought he was blasphemed Hallelujah and they wanted to Stone him and he said why why do you why do you seek to Stone me he said because you being a man making yourself God but if they had turned it around they would have had the true Revelation goding a man come on somebody you got to realize in this Dimension when God created man he created the highest order of himself Hallelujah if you're going to take it higher God himself has to be there understand Hallelujah that's why the Bible said the first Adam was Earthly was a quicking spirit Now The Same quickening Spirit come to restore the Covenant the heart of man hallelujah amen amen it was the natural David was spiritual David hallel the David that was to come Hallelujah the David that will sit on the throne the Bible said he will set on the throne of David Hall his name be his name is the Lord Jesus Christ there b said he gets a new name and whatever that name is you and I will be a part of it Hallelujah glory to God praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord that we should save seventh first verse I believe okay that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hates us you mean to tell me I'm going to be saved from my enemy I'm already saved from my enemy Hallelujah like they had a saying in the world can't touch this Hallelujah but the truth of the man is you can't stop this Hallelujah the names were written in the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world and nobody can pluck you out of his like that brother preached the other day he beun the good work started started and he that begun the good work fa to complete it and I'm resting on that Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord hey to perform the mercy oh yeah our father and to remember His Holy Covenant I'm laughing but that's Joy coming forth Hallelujah the oath which he swear to Our Father Abraham Hallelujah so the the the the the blessing of Abraham mov all the way up to David blessings of David all the way up to this day Hallelujah it never sto Hallelujah but what was one of the blessings Abraham he had an unconditional Covenant come on some I'm just so enjoying myself what is the unconditional Covenant once the Covenant has been made between you and God is no longer what you do for him is what he does for you you can never send away your day of Grace the devil say you don't got too bad you can never get why because the blood of Jesus Christ covers you Hallelujah and when God sees you he doesn't see you he hears your voice mixed with Jesus Hallelujah but the blood is what he looks at so my sin be a SCH Hallelujah he promised snow red brings white understand glory to God Lord hallelujah let me move on let's read the prayer of David answer from the Lord second Samuel 78- 29 you love the Lord I see what David said 2 Samuel 718 then went King David in and sat before the Lord and he said who am I oh is that right who am I oh Lord God and what is my house that thou has brought me hither to and this was yet a small thing in thy sight oh Lord God but thou has spoken also of thy servant house for a great while to come and is this the man of man oh Lord God and what can David say more unto thee for thou oh Lord God knowest thy servant ET for thy word's sake and according to thy own heart has thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them wherefore Thou Art great oh Lord God for there is none like the neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we have heard with our [Music] ears and what one nation in the earth is like Thy people even like Israel whom God went to redeem for people to himself and to make him a name and to do for your great things and Terribles for thy for thy land before the people which thou redeem to thee from Egypt from the Nations and their gods list because he's confirming this is what he's going down in his prayer he's going through events you know he doesn't name them all but he's generalizing and basically saying God it's you who am I you have done all of this Hallelujah listen what he says in the 24th verse but thou has confirmed to thyself thy People Israel to be a people unto thee forever and thou Lord art become their God oh now Lord God the word that thou has spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it forever and do as thou said what is David doing he's taking the word and he's bringing back it back to God it and now as you said it let it be see that's how we have to approach God if you saw how God if you can see how David began to pray he started in humility he humbled himself before God yes and then he exalted God and then he he said God you have kept every promise Bally but now there's another promise that's laying here that we need you to bring to pass hallelujah oh my God 26 and let thaty name be magnified forever saying the Lord of host is the god over Israel and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee amen now I'm going to say this because of the world you know how the world is Israel and all of the stuff but throughout all ages tried to anoun them they can't do it cuz the blessings of the Lord is with them let me bring it down to the to the church now spiritual Israel and they've tried to destroy the church throughout all the ages the real Church hallu you'll know persecution is coming again amen hallelujah and even as the world turn against the the Jews Christians amen because the world don't want any morals anymore hallelujah amen and we are the salt of the earth because of your living God can't destroy the Earth but once the salt is taken away God will then have the the the space to move but let me say this to so you can see how blind the world will be after bride is gone they will kill Moses and Elijah y amen and the Bible said they threw a party world through a party is that right because they thought they were thinking they had defeated God true that's the word amen but you got to understand they're looking at Moses and Elijah as though they're the evil ones because they and they're believing that they're right that's what they did with Jesus they were so blind they thought crucifying Jesus like crucifying a devil that's right my I could hear that old lady say at that cross what has he done all he's ever done done was good you understand me sir Hallelujah people don't understand what's happening but everything that's happening now is to push the world into Union so that they could all come against Israel it is prophecy y'all got to understand me amen let me move on let me move on but the victories of David I'm going to come to that in quickly I got to hurry up but the victory of David his greatest victory was not Goliath but let me glory to God oh my where am I where am I I lost my track okay 28 yeah oh now oh Lord God thou art that God and thy words be true and thou has promised this goodness unto thy servant therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue forever before thee for thou oh Lord God has spoken it and with thy blessings let the house of thy servant be blessed forever Hallelujah am you said what was David's greatest Victory Jalem which he made Israel political and religious Center is the same today he defeated the Philistines so thoroughly that they never seriously threaten the Israel Israel security again but we find out that the Philistines are on the move again phis Chang it to Palestine but the giant has already been defeated they can call out whatever they want to the World Council of churches that you whatever they going to kill them yes the Bible said they're going to kill them Hallelujah but they won't be dead Hallelujah why the Bible said in one day he going to give them a Revival in one [Music] day will be filled with the Holy Ghost in one day K the flesh they didn't kill the flesh be one that's waiting on me you might think that's crazy just like I told my family I said where were you before you got here hallelujah I said there's another world whether you want to believe it or not Hallelujah your first world was in your mother's womb is that right God gave you eyes God Gave You mouth God gave you y know you didn't even need it there so you will Beed in your's womb come Hallelujah that's why you must be born again when you're born again formed inion Hallelujah to God Amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah that's right Hallelujah that's why we got to work these Supernaturals we're Bor Supernatural see what I'm saying let's move on so David wins addition no victories over the Philistines thees over the over the malachit over the orites and the King had I can't even pronounce it right am zah after which they become tributaries in other words David conquered so much till the the the the the little countries around him began to bring Tri to himid most important but that he made Jerusalem the capital of Israel understand Hallelujah and whether they like it or not it's still here you say wait a minute brother how can it be because this is just a reflection of what over Y what you cannot see is that the real Jerusalem is above it it's in another dimension Hallelujah is that right the Bible said when John saw the bride saw the New Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven is that right where he set it's going to set there where the old one is and who's going to take it away then hallelujah oh glory to God you think you love the Lord First Chronicles give me some more scripture just a little bit more timeon Hallelujah am the blessings of David my God God now I'm talking about Jesus Christ now not the David of the Old Testament but the son of David of the New Testament son of davidy on Hallelujah now therefore thus shall thou say unto my servant David thus said the Lord of host I Thee from the Sheep coat even from following the sheep that thou should be ruler Over My People Israel now you got to remember that the angel of the Lord brought this scripture because the same David David had to deal with same David had to deal with Hallelujah the same God is talking to him Malachi and have been with thether soever I have been with thee whether soever thou has walked and have cut off all thine enemies from thee and have made thee a name like the name of great in the Earth Hallelujah also I will ordain a place for My People Israel plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall their children of the wicked waste them anymore as at their beginning and since the time that I command the judges to be over My People Israel moreover I will SED all thine enemies am furthermore I'll tell thee that the Lord will build thee an house and it shall come to pass the days be expired that thou must go to be with thy father that I will raise up thy seed after thee th sons and I will establish his kingdom he shall build me in house establish his throne [Music] forever but then after Solomon Jesus even said what man what what house can you build me I don't I don't dwell in buildings that are made by man's hands is that right when it came to Jesus God said give me a body that's my and know ye not ye are the temple of God glory to God yes Jesus he shall build me a house and I will establish this house forever amen talk about God Jesus I will be his father he shall be my son amen amen and I will not take away my Mercy away from him amen as I took it from him that was before thee but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever and his throne shall be established forever now I'm going to read this last part I'm going let you go that's what people don't understand the Key of David was not on his pocket hand but it was on his shoulder Hallelujah and that key that shoulder represented his strength and his power should be called wonderful what I'm saying glory to God but it is his shoulder he carries me he that had the Key of David this of course this is in your the church ages this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true Christ perfect realization contrast with partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus liken unto Moses David a man after God's Own Heart was king of Israel Jesus is the great David of every God now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of no priest came yet he ate of the shoad enemy establishing the as king he sat on the throne he was a wonderful type of Christ now it says in Isaiah 2222 key of the House of David lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shall shut open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the Church of David signify at that time is mere Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus Christ standing in the midst of the the lamp stand to our Lord after he resurrected pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck is not placed in the hands of another man the verse could not be saying that he he alone was the use of the that key for he alone opens and shuts no man has the right but Jesus himself is that right but where is the key it is on the shoulder what does shoulder have to do with it 96 says and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does that mean answer is this the Pras government upon his shoulder wony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil over the groom shoulder [Music] signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also he bear the responsibility and the care and that he and and he alone no one else no other man other power right responsibility and that belov is the Key of David God being Sovereign Knew by Divine decree his chose her did not choose him called her she did not come to her own for her in his own blood for herly committed to him ACBL Christ is the head of the church call Abraham Lord is happy she obeys for that is her Delight Hallelujah but have been but have been heeded this truth have they esteemed his person who alone has the full sov authority over his church I say no for every age church has been governed by hierarchy Apostolic succession closing the door of Mercy and Grace To whom it will and instead assuming love and responsibility of the church it it has had with mercenary lust prayed upon her and destroyed her in luxury poor Church fed on husk of abuse not one age did any different each bound itself to organizations put the government Church to that government let the people rise up and they were brutally suppressed every denomination has has the same every denomination that it has the key to the government of the church every denomination claims that it's open is the open door not true it is Jesus and Jesus alone he sets the members in the church them with their Ministries he put she is she is his solely property and he has no other one but heru I'm coming to the end what a far cry from the reality of the church age we live one day soon these men that even now purpose to speak for the church will be rising up in the a community move to place a living Antichrist in the head of their organization which disposes the Lord and we will find him we and we will find him Christ outside the church and that's Revelation three process behold I stand at the door and knock Voice open the door I will come into him and will St with him but let me say this our Lord is not defeated claim open the door to God Liars all that the father has given him will come to him him and no wise will be cast out he will lose none of them John 6 37-39 and when the last and when the last elected members to the body of Christ comes in Lord here the Key of David not David the king Israel and is not Jesus Son of David according to the fact that he was set upon the throne of David in the Millennium Hallelujah and Reign and rule over his inheritance surely so the Key of David signifies that it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium he who has the keys death and hell will raise up his own amen that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the Earth sorry how wonderful our Lord has all the answers in him are the promises of God fulfill truly by being in him we are HS to what he has purchased for us let stand thank you for your patience thank you for your patience the road to em us three men walk that way as they reach their destination the two men be take the third
