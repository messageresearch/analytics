Lord take the men out of the way Lord and speak O Lord Jesus Lester here that's the ears of father God that will hear the word of God and let our so father God say at the end of the service that truly the Lord works with us closely he spoke to us Lord Jesus Christ bless the entire church of God and bless us O Lord Jesus in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen let's open our Bible to the book of Romans chapter 8 we read from verse 35 to 39 the Bible says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for as it is written for thy sake we are we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord amen let's go again to 2nd Kings second Kings verse of chapter 19 verse 9 to verse 13 second king or chapter 19 verse 9 to verse 13 the Bible says and now we'll make the house of Ahab like the house of Jerome that's not the right one chapter 9 I wasn't chapter 7 chapter 9 verse I wrote the wrong future we can have a we can't we can't sit down thank you I wrote the wrong the wrong scripture so duh we think first of brother boots for the trusting you think brother Troy in the church for having us today and tonight but this morning we'll be speaking on we've been made more than conquerors because as we know as Christians sometimes we have to go to trials sometimes we have to go through tribulations but we have as we read in Romans chapter 8 God we have been made more than conquerors through Christ the scripture that we wanted to read and second Kings was talking about this King his name was was talking about the story of Ezra kaya and the king that the name of the King were was attacking them was his name was a Sennacherib and then their ducky came and then he started to he first sent his messengers to our izakaya telling him that you know what I know that you trust your God but I want to tell you one thing that your God will not be able to to deliver you from my hands because I would kill you and I would destroy all Israel and then when the messenger came to Hezekiah and he gave doubt the message as a guy about received a message and Hezekiah now when you read this you went to the Lord that's why sometimes when we have hard times that's why we sometimes when we have troubles when we have trials our first things that we have to go is to go to the Lord because the Lord is a Solutions caused by ourselves we're not able to overcome it ourselves we now able to fight against all things that that the devil is attacking us now the king being there in these situations you know having nothing to do you know he found himself powerless before that king and he found himself that you know I have no strength to go fight that King and then you know you say about well I know one thing I have a God you know that King began to challenge that God that King you know it began to tell if you know what I've destroyed all the nations surrounding me he began to tell them you know what I've destroyed you know all the nations I love this road that the more abiding all those kings they had also their gods but I destroyed them and I want to tell you something that your God will not be able to say you know to get you away of out of my hands because I would kill you all and that came when you receive that message he went to the Lord he went to the Lord he said Lord you know what it is true that he destroyed everything it is true that he destroyed all the gods it is true that he destroyed all the nations that were surrounding him but there's one thing those gods were made by man those God were not the true God but I served the true God you know who created everything we created you know that the heavens and earth the Seas there the animals the birds and everything and I served the true God and he said lord I want you to come and fight for me Lord I want you to come in and fight my battles and there and stand there and and then the Lord if you read the other day the entire chapter you find out the Lord began not to tell him to remind him what it did he first started to tell them you know what you what you did wrong and you know how the version of Israel should behave and how they didn't behave but by the end of the chapter the Lord said the Lord told me said you know what I will come and I will fight your battles you know I despite everything that you did I would come and I would fight you about why because you are knowledge to God you all know less God and then God came there and if our ain't God fought for him God killed every guy killed all the all DSE and then arriving there that key escaped that came ran away but Lord as he defied it as he challenged God God wanted God had to show him that you know I am the true God those God that you worship that you killed and those nations that you destroy you know where Nasser said I said serving the true God now there is a difference between me between those gods made by man and the true God that was served and then God you know and then when you he ran away and he found himself not worshiping the idols and then two of his children came to him and and they killed him you know it's to show that we're surfing a true God I don't know what you're going through this morning I don't know what how you know how hard the time is for you I don't know how you know what what difficulties you have or what problems you have but I want to tell you that we're serving the true God you know though the devil can come to you and challenge you with sickness though the devil can come to you and challenge you with the problems you know in your family and everywhere is schoolwork you know you feel like everything nothing is going on but I want to tell you one thing that we serve a true God that we serve a God that if we run to him and if we had another gym he will come and then he will fight for us and then we find then we were seen the Bible we see the story of Gideon Gideon was a man and the Bible as the Bible tells the story we found out that Gideon was not even able to fight he never fought before and then he found themselves in the situation where they had war in the country that everything was what was wrong in the country and then God came now Gideon I tell you you know you are a mighty man of Valor you know stand up and I will use you to fight stand up and I will use you you know to fight this battle you know that's why the yeah you know you get here was a young people that's why ourselves even young people I know we cannot say you know that you know I'm young and I cannot serve the Lord there are me young and God cannot use me Gideon was a young people here was a young man and then God used him you know why because the name of God was challenged and every time by the name of God is childish God has to use someone who would be willing you know to take up the challenge and to fight the devil you know these schemes and this man you know we're challenging God you know they didn't know the power of God they didn't know that God was able you know to destroy them by they came anyway they came anyhow to challenge them but God shows them and God told them you know what I have people you know I have people in this age I have people you know though the trials are you going to know that they're hard times you're going to God is able to say that you know what I have one man who can still trust me you know job was there in the city you know everything's going wrong you know his body you know his body was sick you know his children everybody was killed and these brings friends amongst him you know we began to tell him you know why don't you just curse the Lord why don't you just you know denied the Lord and go away and then die easily but then he said when I got old sitting before he said you know what he in this entire city I have one person though you know though you take everything from him don't you take you know now he's my knee do you take is healthy the does he do you take his children from him don't you check everything you know around him surrounding him by the one thing he would never curse me and God was there watching you know that job you know going through destroyers God was there watching job you know how joy was was going to take the challenge because God ever came to God to challenge him he said you know what it's because of this you gave him this and that's why he still serving you you know it's because he gave him a good job that's why he's still serving you it's because you gave him a good wife that's why he's still serving you is because you gave him a good good children that's why he steals area serving you so let me take these people out of his hand let me take these people away and still and see if we still have you know this testimony that I always still serve God you know sometimes when we speak and sometimes when we say things you know we usually say it just by the sake of saying you know we say that you know what you know even though I I'm sick today you know I was staring serve God by the true moment to say this day is one the sickness coming to you you know where the true moment to say you know to say to trust in the Lord is when you have hard times when you have problems in your family when you have you know everything is going wrong that's when we see that you know this man was not joking when he said this and then you know job was there you know going through all these times you know going through a hard times but he never cursed the name of the Lord you know God was there watching him my job knew that at the end of the day you know he's Redeemer was living is redeemer leave and then God came and then God restored everything God gave him the double of everything he had and then we have to know that one thing that that when we read the Bible but we found ourselves you know know we see that when when we have our trials and persecutions when we have you know everything going wrong that in order for us to overcome it we have to have cross inside of us you know if we go to our first John chapter 4 verse 4th 1st John chapter 4 verse 4 the Bible says that year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world you know you have overcome this world you have overcome that are everything that is coming to you why because greater is He that isn't there the greater is He that is in you than he that is worth you know we're serving the greater God we're serving you know a God who can stand and there is no sickness there is no heart and there's no trial that can stand against us why because we're serving the greater one and then and then we're we we have to know that you know that there is no testimony without test you know that's why we have to go through tests - for sure that we can have testimony I want to read what what the Prophet says he says that why does he stand by the reason is in Romans chapter 8 verse 13 17 to 18 he said that and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs were and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for our reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can train because power apart from carrier is satanic but power with character is speak to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame that he overcame and sat down with his father story I mean his father turn then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now he's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when we when he comes Oh what treasure are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation you know there the prophet of God is explaining why we do have trials what we do have tests he says that he's experienced they are showing that test first comes to form our character because if we want to be very kind of a test come to to form our character and with if we go back to the Bible in Romans chapter 5 verse 3 to verse 5 we read Roman chapter 5 verse 3 to verse 5 the Bible says and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us now here we're seeing the you know that the Bible is going with the prophets saying that you know when we have tests he works our character you know when we have tips God is showing us to be / - be patient you know well sometimes ago I was going myself through hard times and you know I found myself in this situation where I had to pay bills you know it was I remember it was it was on Tuesday and I had to pay those bills on on side the Saturday of the same week and I found there that you know I had money by the money that I had was not enough to pay and I was mad about that and I had a and I had to to have another reminding you know to competing to pay those bills by the end of the day the week and then I found myself and I started you know thinking as always when we do have trials and yeah when we do have things coming to hospital we first think to find solutions but you know I found it I began to think you know if I asked my dad to give me but some money and and then they took him to me I just asked my dad yesterday and told me that he didn't have money I said no myself that where can I go where would I go and then I and then a voice came to me and say that you know and that the devil without but I believe that was the devil coming to me and say that you know what go to or go to God is sending me to go to God in prayer by go complain to God and it happened that I just preached this message about by do not complain when you try and now hear the devil is telling me you know go to God and go pray and then complain to that complaint and then I and then I didn't understand why I wear that voice scamming and I just opened my mouth and I said thank you Jesus and then I forgot about the situation and then I began to leave and you know to go out I went to work and and I believe it was on Thursday and I see my manager coming and giving me the envelope and saying that you know what this is very decent for my wedding and then by the time and when I received the envelope I didn't open it and I began to think you know what I have to put the good suit that I have on you know cuz it's my managers wedding and I have to you know to show them that I also have certain you know and I can't dress up for sir and then as I began to think about how to how to get there and you know when that that wedding will be and when everything were being and then I um by the end of my shift you know I got in my car and I drove back home and arriving at home and before getting off the car I said well let me first open this envelope and see what what is the schedule and when is the wedding and you know at what time so that I can get there and when I opened but when I opened the envelope brother I saw the exact amount of money that I was missing you know to show you that you know God is there you know to fight our battles to show you that God is there God listened to us God knows what you're going through and he knows how to supply to it you know only if you trust in him there is only one thing if you trust in him God will fight your battles you know it happened that in the Bible but one time you know the other that the children of airlines you know got the to turn over like the Bible compare them try to evil children you know that they came there that Israel was in a battle and fighting and Israel find himself be being defeated and then the distrito availa you know think I thought that you know what we have the ark in the temple that if we can go and check the Ark of God God will come and fight for us you know at that time you know they they thought that God would still fight for them but God didn't fight for them why because their lives were not good you know and they went there and they took the arm they took the ark and then cuz we know that if we read the Bible we see them every time that Israel was going through a bottle when they healthy when they had the ark in their camp you know they were they were always winning and then they throw that that time was still was going to be the same thing but they forgot one that their lives you know didn't permit or didn't Allah God to walk because I choose to work through them because we found out that in the Bible those children were coming to church and you know taking a tree they are taking the lambs that was given for sacrificing but bring them back to home and cook them and and eat with their fathers and everything and I thought that I didn't repent first that's why you know there is it's really important that when we come to church that we may have respect you know that's why it is really important that when we come to church we have we have to respect the presence of God you know we preached on their land last Friday about respect fear in God and we wish driven by by God's grace we we found out that when we come to church and everybody when he comes to church he said his prayers Lord come among us Lord come and dwell among us and when God always answer to his invitations now when we called us to be among us he always there you know when we were seeing the Bible the story of that man who called Jesus cross and say Lord that he sent His Messenger to to go and call Jesus crossing and then Jesus went there and jesus knew that they are arriving to dr. their very arriving to Simon's last house that he will be mistreated but he went anyhow what to show that why that when you call me I will be there but there is a lot of time here many times that we found ourselves when we call God and God is here amongst our by sometimes we put God in the corner and then you say well brother I said what what you mean by putting on the corners you know the way we act in church you know it's putting God in the corner you know sometimes among God's especially if we've gone at least that when we come in we usually come late to church you know if that is not showing respect if we were if we had for example like a meeting with with the great man and now with the president we will find ourselves in church earlier you know to take up spend you know to take the first Freddy to take the first view but what about God who is most powerful than they were the president what about God who is most powerful than any man but we use we neglect God and then we think that God will fight for us but first before God fighting for us we effort to show respect that's why you find in the Bible Joshua when he came in when were when he was everywhere when he he found himself before before the walls and you know every the city was was built up with their walls and he didn't even have any in any way to go through and he found themselves with but with young people who didn't have experience of fire fighting because all the the other ones dead passed away in the desert and then he had to meet the angel and notice the angel told him one thing that take your shoes off because you are in the holy ground to show respect you know when you are in front of God you have to have respect you know when you are in God's presence you know in church you have to have respect in your way of acting in a way of doing things you know you have to show God you know God you are welcome here and when you show God that when you show that God is welcome God is always you know pleasing to Black's and to you know to bless us and then we saw that character had to purpose have to purpose first thing is to form I mean potentially has to purpose first thing is to form a character you know cause we have to recall to went with him when we read in revelation 2 3 verse 21 the Bible says that he that overcometh will be in God's throne you know for the Church of the audition and then we found that before us to be in God's throne for for us to you know to feast with God we have to have a certain character you know because God can never let anyone who doesn't have character you know who doesn't know how to trust God you know him is wrong you know because God doesn't want to see people or God and God doesn't want to see his bride you know being tossed about with you know everything that the words can be the words can can bring to us and that's why you know people he has to to send us a test that's why I had to send us you know our tribulations and trials to form us because God want us to be solid God want us to you know I testimony to know that we're serving it through God you know as a as one day uh I believe was brother Sam preaching and then he saw and he began he went to the Bible and began to say that you know Moses winner when Moses went to the burning bush before Moses carefully experienced with God Moses you know had in his mind was it's only knew they got of his father Moses only knew that the God of Abraham Moses only knew they got of Isaac Moses only knew they got of Jacob but Moses said to a great you came to come here to come and the point where the same God of his father was his God and how that God who had to be his God is to go SDA was to have an experience with that God you know he had to know that you know when I'm going to age it to said that that God's people free I have this experience to show them that you know what I'm serving the I am the God who is with me and he told me you know what go and I would be with you you know and then and then when he came there you know you had that assurance that God was with him that's why when he had trials that's why when things you know cookin didn't work as he as he as he was thinking you know he could still keep the faith why because he knew that he made God and God was with him that's what we find in the Bible that joint was emphasizing that we have to have God inside of us so that we may find our bodies because we're because when we have battle it's not us fighting it's God fighting for us you know when we have battle is not us fighting it's the Holy Spirit cross the word that is fighting for us that why that's why it is so important for us to have the Holy Spirit that's why it is very important for us for us to know God personally that's why it is so important to her for us to have you know that experience when we have those things coming you know we can say that you know what we're serving the true God we're serving the God who reigns we're serving the God who before we had you know we had December I had this but the devil came to me in this way but he set me free and no matter how come the devil can come again you know no matter what suit that ever can put on you know the same God who first fought for me you know he will come and he will come and fight me of my my battles and then the Prophet said that sometimes the cloudy skies are not signs of God disapproval you know sometimes when we go through hard times we think that God is not with us you know sometimes when we go when you have sickness you have cancer you have you know we're about hard time in your family sometimes you know as human we think that God is not with us that sometimes you know God has rejected us sometimes you know you know but we cannot even go to God's praises sometimes you know that we we now worth anything that you know I rather died and then leave by some time God just want us to be closer to him you know because they just want us to be closer to him remember that the story that a prophet said about the shepherd who had a who had a lamb and who had a little sheep you know that lamb what was going away from him that lamb was not being next to the Shepherd by the shepherd wanted that lamb to be closer to him and what the Shepherd had to do was to break that land leg you know to show him that you know what about breaking your leg I would take care of you you know somebody that I take myself you know I put myself in the shoes of that lamb you know what I would say I would say that truly this shepherd doesn't love me because if he loved me he couldn't break my lamb I had my leg if you loved me you couldn't want me to suffer because breaking somebody's leg you know it's a pain you know you're going to you know you can't walk it and you can do the activities as you can you know you can't play playing in sports and you know you can't walk you can't go to school and you can do nothing you know you will be there and they're laying and waiting for people to take care of you you know if I put myself enough in that then they left shoes and I would say that you know that the shepherd doesn't love me but that wasn't what I was in the heart of the Shepherd the Shepherd wanted only to express his love to the lamb showing him that you know what when you will be closer to me you know I will show you I would take you in my hands you know that's why we have to sometimes cloudy skies that's why we have sometimes you know thieves working that's why we have sometimes at work in school and you know everywhere our homes when we find ourselves you know that things are not working and then we sometimes think that God is not with us sometimes we think that you know what you know I you know I rather die and instead of say I'm suffering like this but God just wanted to be closer to him you know God just wonder because when we have trials that bring us to pray that will bring you to pray that will bring you you know to have this closer relationship with God that will bring you you know to go ask for help and I want to read what the Prophet said the prophecy that the cloudy skies and storms of life are not signs of God disapproval neither are the bright skies and steel water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is the earth is only in the beloved his log is elective which he had for us his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world there are many prophet asked does he love us and then he said yes so he said yes he does but how shall we know he said that we shall know because he said so we shall know that God loves us why because he said so and then and then beber beber that sometimes you know the devil can ask you because sometimes we go through you know by my baby troubles and you know your mind and you you ask yourself questions you know that's really God love me or do I really have the Holy Spirit or you know why am I going through this trials and when they the prophets say that you know what you know God love you because he said so you know he gave his son for you you know he let his son died on the cross suffer the pain that nobody can do that nobody can bear you know why for your sake so that you may believe in him and by believing in him is giving you eternal life and I bet and I keep on the prophecy that he because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit facing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him he said that by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy a means of by connecting myself with joy amidst the trial that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass you know how can I show to God that I love him he said that you know by believing what God says there is many promise in the world that that is for us that are for us you know when you believe those promises you know you're showing God that you love him and then he said what by the second thing is by conducting myself through trials that he allows himself you know to come to us because if you buy we go back to the story of job we found out that before the devil went to job he had first to come by God you know before the devil come to your life before the devil do anything to you he has first to go by God he had first to to get his permission by God you know God had first you know God had first to tell him that you know what I give you now go go ahead but there's one thing that God always tell him do not touch his life why because God wants you to stand as a testimony you know because there's Trier than the message trials the prophet he's saying that you know better destroyers the devil he's attacking God the devil he's accusing God you know saying that God cannot heal saying that God we will forsake his children saying that God you know it doesn't love us by the prophets say that God is looking for the man for the person for the believers who can stand against the trial who can stand and show God to the devil that you know what God loved us that God healed me that I had decent and I am a weakness that here is God he said that there is the devil and I was attacking that ever now is bringing people is bringing his weakness to show to prove that God is that the promise of God our wrongs but God now also is looking for you know God forgot in the Bible took job and God took Abraham and the you know God to we've got to Peter and God took everybody but that's not enough God is still looking in this age you know who can stand and who can stand and give the testimony that you know God's promises are true who can stand and give their testimony that you know though the two daughters that the cloud disguise the door every trials and everything I can still keep the faith who can stand and say that to the devil you know what you know I serve it through God now he delivered me that one day I was bound and seen by he came to me he set me free that one day I was bound and seen he came to me and he gave me the Holy Spirit when the devil is coming a decision instead of trying to say that God cannot feel the people with the Holy Spirit when the devil is coming in this edge and trying to say that God cannot save people my god is turning that you know God God is looking for people you know for bride for Christian who can stand up and say you know what God filled me with the Holy Spirit I remember who I was I remember what I was doing before I remember you know where I was but now I can say I'm not the same person now I can say that I've been set free now I can say that you know I've been delivered and now I can say that I'm filled and now I can say that God is with me and when you feel that's when God come and fight for you and you say about well brother I see but but we see in the world you know that those people also have trials about how did they overcome when they don't have trial whether I don't have gotten inside of him you know that was the same question that I bear the children of Israel was asking themselves they say about those people that more abided that they are Syrian and those people don't have God but how when they have battles they overcome and then God is only required us to have him for her for him to overcome you know why because you differ from these people you know the way God is trading with you you know it's different from the way God is treating but you know to our but we've got his training with the pagan and with the world you know you have to have God so that you may overcome because you are his children you'll remember the Bible said that dial gently only got your skies only those he loved you know is that to show you that God loves you that's what God had to make sure that you have him you know because he said that if you have him you know you are more than conquerors because that's why the Bible said that we have been more than conquerors because we have God inside of us you know the Bible you know that's why and I love when by when brother Branham you know preached about how can I overcome you know he preached about this word how can I overcome but he didn't preach about what can I overcome you know because he knew that a godly that the devil can change for he knew that you know the same trials and endure the same tribulation that he had you know the children I that the trials Audia that we know the things that was in his time when he was living will not be the same you know with us today we know as young people or as a young man I know that you know you know that now it's harder you know to leave you you know we're in this world but but there is one thing that you show that sound to overcome you know because they knew that the devil will change form by showing us how to overcome and say that you know for us to overcome we have to have cross inside of us that's the key having Christ inside of us you know that's the key you know having having the Holy Spirit inside of us that's where we were we were offer comes and the prophet talking about sickness the prophet says and I don't want you to get the impression that me or Oral Roberts or somebody else is the only person that's all dead that is ordained to do this he said that every minister is or them to do it every believer he said about whether he's a minister or not is all dead to do it every person that believes as right as a right to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I don't say your posture or any will be taking the gift of discernment that they don't have to do that that's not their calling that's not their calling to do that that's their that does to be one in an age but we found out that you are called as believer you know these signs shall follow them I don't point out any person them that believe you know you believe it with all your heart you know and then when you believe these things and these signs will follow you and I remember one day I owe me money my home where I'll even you know about might one day buzzer I believe it was during the summer even become even before I start preaching and then I and then one day I woke up early in the morning and my mother was not feeling good and then he called me and he said I said would you do this recipe for me and so that made drinking so that I feel well you know I gave her and I do everything that I taught her and she told me and I gave her and that recipe that that you that she asked me to do you know made things worse and then brother least for I know but many of you know him and and some but you know you just woke up her in the morning and went up with ya in her bedroom and you know and she found that he found our mother you know you know laying there and feeling she was not feeling good you know she was everywhere you know churning and being here and there and then he called me and say I said come here look I look out I look out my mom is feeling and then he said you know why let's lay our hands on him let's say hey let's pray for her and we said we were we were there when we prayed and we asked God to heal her and after somehow were to go be like that she was right she was made right she was healed and she was able to go to work why because we show that you know you know we have power sometimes we just don't recognize our position as Christ best bride sometimes we just don't recognize our position as Christian the order that the Bible says that the old one when they the Holy Spirit will come with power you know where the Holy Spirit will come with power and that power is not just something or that part we cannot just put that power in a box saying that you know what I am NOT able to do this or I'm not able to this thing or this thing is now on my level you know everything if you believe if you just know your position you don't want you will fight that battle and you will really overcome the only because if you know your position you know what I love about the children of Israel they knew what that was they know who there was and they knew that God that were serving they lose that a God who said them free you know Papa when there was we fair will the greatest Armond world in that in their time but there could go said freeze you know that was set free you know but they they knew who their was why because they had experience that they experienced God that's why it is so important to have the experience with God because sometimes the devil will come to you not sometime by the devil will come to you try to show you that God is not able to do it but you know what one thing it also it is important to what to have experience to experience God you know even the Prophet himself you know yeah he said that that sometimes when you pray for the sick people you know he was praying for that morning that that that boy was was blinded and he said that usually when he pray for the sick people and if they don't they're not healed at the pleasure i sympathy always tells them you know what go and believe you will be here but at that time it was different you know that boy needed to see and then with the Prophet prayed for his first diamond that did that but was not healed he pray for the second time the boy was not still here and they bet the devil now came to him starting you know to show him that you know what that this boy will not be here just let him going if he has faith you know and you will be healed and then the portrait not now began now to think about his experience that he had with God now the Prophet I began to think about you know to show that therefore how the same God it was praying you know works before and then when he began to think about those things when he began to think about those things that build up his faith and then they prayed again for the last time for that boy and I bought a head and that one was able to see you know why because he knew who he was why he knew why who God was to him why he knew you know what God did with them before you know that's why it is very important to know God to have a personal relationship with God that's why it is very important to know who you are that you know that when I speak that God will always be there when I speak when I say something God will always be there behind me and then to approve everything why because he said that these signs will follow them that believe if you just believe then we follow you they prophets say that God didn't the God didn't name people by saying this it didn't say that these signs we only follow ministers or pastors all the prophets all great men no he said that this time we follow every believers it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter you know how you are he said that this time we follow you if you only believe and then we saw that the brigade a prophecy that God gave us the most powerful weapon in the world you know which is prayer he said that when we pray even he said the weakest Christian when it is on his knees pray the entire hell is trembling you know the devil had to know that you know something wrong is about to happen why because you know that when we pray and a prophet of God said that when we come to God in the name of Jesus cross Jesus Christ takes our place you know he gets into action and then it takes our place now it's God himself pray and when God Himself Jesus Christ himself is pray you know he that that thing has to happen you know we we have to come and pray that's why it is also important you know to have our personal time of Prayer you know as Christians you know we have battles we have trials but we have also to have our present time of praise you know to quieten ourselves and let God speak to us you know to quiet our self or sometimes we do too much talking but we but there's a time where we have to go there you know in that room you know where we close every doors and we will cross every doors and everything every windows and everything we just said there Lord speak to me and he will speak to you Lord speak to me it was speak to you if he doesn't speak to you begin to worship him if he doesn't speak to you you know begin to say to to speak to him some sweet words you know don't first start by asking him just begin to worship him show him how good he is to you you know show him how good he has been to you show you how to show him how he set you free when I began began not to remind him what is done for you and then all of a sudden you will find yourself you know questions that you have you know questions that you had you find solution you know things at your hand you know you will find yourself you know God is speaking to me I remember one time I I think couple of months ago I was there I had in my mind you know a question about a Bible verse and I and I was myself why these things that to happen I wanted to know that the details of everything that had to happen but I didn't know Who am I going to go to you know I being then I came in I was so lazy to go and study their words and you know I said well let me ask you let me ask brother Brooks and I texted brother Brooks and I asked him and brother Bruce Garrett said but you know brother I have to study and I said bye well I need this answer right now and I said well they let me test again brother Jesse Smith and he was said yes he said the same thing and I said well so now what why do why do I have to do and I said there is not any place to go to I have to go to God and I went to my room and I start praying and then I heard the voice of God telling me you know what you have to go look at the sixth seal when I find myself and I said why am I going to go look at the sixth year you know something that is not even related to him and when I was there listening to the Prophet and by the end of the service you know I found the answer of my prayer I found the answer of the question that I had you know to show you what that when we go to God and pray you know God is there to listen to us God is there God God has his ears open you know that's the difference between idols and God you know idols and ears but they cannot listen you know idols have mouths but they cannot speak others have hands but I cannot touch I don't have F feet but I cannot walk but we're serving a god but we he has here's who can hear you know he has mouths he can he can speak you know you can answer to your questions you know no matter what you have you know no matter what you know what the question is no matter what the destroyer is if you go to God in prayer you know God will stand for you you know God God we give you the answer what what you need you know that God would give you the answer what what you need and it will show you everything and then I I want to read the Bible the Bible says that you know God's strength he's made perfect when we are weak then let's go to second Corinthians chapter or chapter 12 verse 4 verse 9 second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 the Bible says that he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most godly therefore without rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me you know sometimes we feel ourselves like we are about to give up you know sometimes we feel ourselves in the solution where we are about to give up you know you feel weak and you feel that you know what you know I'm giving up and but I want just to remind you that that's when God strength gum you know his strength is made perfect when we weak when you find when we found ourselves not able to do it when we found ourselves not able to overcome that's when God came well that's when God comes you know cause God doesn't want you you know to think that you made it by yourself God doesn't want you to think that you know because of you that's why you passed these days that's why God with Gideon God had to you know God had to wait to tell Gideon you know what bring all those soldiers you know into tests you know but there are too many you know you have too many of them but you know God wanted to show Gideon that with feel where I lie with a few soldiers with only 300 soldiers you know he will overcome you know we wanted to show Gideon not to trust on your abilities now to trust on your strength now to trust them you know on every anything else by trusting me you know when you weak you know when you were when you're about to give up when you think that you know everything is turning against me and and I'm and I'm looking for solutions and I cannot find you know that's when God's true that God's strength comes you know remember Jacob when he was there you know he first flee from her from his brother and they and his way back and you know he saw someone coming to him and say you know what your brother is coming with my demons you know against you trying to attack you and Jack o find himself you know with his children and his family and he found himself weak and as every man you know he tried to you know to find solutions and he said you know I will divide my groups into three go to groups and those go first and if it kills you maybe when I would come it will have mercy on me but Jacob find himself that everything that was trying to do we're not we're not work but you had to buy you remember you thought about one thing I have a god that I can run to you know now I'm weak I'm about to give up now my brother is coming against me to to attempt to you know my now my brother's kami against me to fight against me and I have no right and I cannot fight again I cannot fight back you know I I don't have soldiers and I don't have the army as he do as he does now where am I going to go you know you thought about God and when he went to God God gave him victory that was able to change the heart of his brother you know his brother was coming with a you know where we fade you know where his brother was guy who was I was coming you know well you know with the idea to kill him but when his brother well when when God's changed his heart of the heart of his brother you know God put love and his brother and when he came there instead of killing him you know he kissed him you know when Jacob finally you know found himself in the situation I'm giving up you know he found himself that he didn't have strength you know and then he thought about God and yourself sometime maybe you going through a trial where maybe you're going through something something that is so hard and you find yourself you don't have strength you know you want to give up you're about to give up but you know still have that faith you know still have the faith God will God will be there because he said that his strength is made perfect in our weakness it's when we weak that's when it comes when we weak that that's one God comes and in closing I want to read the above this book of the prophet but about pizza SDE go stairs to her nest the pay page five the Prophet says that if we go only take the wings of the Bible God's written word and have as much confidence in the Word of God by the Holy Spirit if if we could only have as much confidence as the eagle did in his wings you know he knew that he could make one jump and above and be above that timber and I could not and I could never have to shot him I watched him you know and after a while he got he got tired and he made just one big jump and flapped his wings about twice and and you know what you know what you know what he did he did not flop again he just knew how to set his wings and he held his wings out and when the wind came in and when the wind came in he and then he lifted air and then the wind are lifted in far away and he lifted them up he lifted his wings up and I stood and watched him until he began just until he began he became just a little speck and under the page six that the Prophet said god help us to take the wings out of the ego take every divine promise God has given God has given us in the Bible that is in the reason alright that is the reason friends you are not living in bondage it is because the he said that that isn't the reason because you're not living a bondage it is because you set your wings in the promise of God and by faith the whole and by faith the Holy Ghost lifted you up he said that the ego history Harper nest and if there is anyone who would dare set his wing in God's promise in his world God would take you from the it from this miserable unrighteous ungodly selfish life that you are living and make you free and happy to live above sin and live in best for atmospherics that the world knows nothing about and then he say Amen he said that if we can only set your wings in the winds of faith if you can only set your wings in God's promises you know God gave a lot of promises he said he will be your healer he said that you know don't take third of tomorrow you know if we can feed that the little bird what about you you know God gave promises in the Bible you know about everything and he also gave promises to overcomers if you read the two Reata to that a church chapter 2 and chapter 3 of the Bible you will see that at the end of every age God gave the promises of overcoming for over comers you know he died overcoming I would do this he that overcometh I would do this you know why don't you just go into the fight it's not you fighting it's God fighting for you so stop running away from it you know stop running away from the devil because when you run away from the devil he gets bigger when you run away from him he's getting bigger and bigger you know you have to stand against him you know and showing him you know what as David even though I'm a little at this dance there even though I'm young I can still fight Goliath you know Goliath cannot stand against my god because I know who I'm serving if brother you can come and play or set your wings in the butt stretch over your your wings in the the winds of faith did you know that song all right let's stand it's all right you know if we can only set our wings in the winds of faith the song says that there are two roads that you may take one bus I give Justin any songs he said that there are two roles that you can take one by side one by faith by telling you to take the Word of God or we already say that you take the Word of God or what you see what you believe is what will be and then we said that set your wings to the winds of faith you can fly in the higher place do not struggle it's by grace set your wings to the winds of faith you say that what your need what is your cry what is your need what is your mountain that is much too high just speak the Word of God and let me just speak the word of God and by and by the damn mountain and depth things that that you think is too high it will move or you will fly he said that was the ego in the sky he does not struggle and it does not strive for because the power that makes him rise he's already in the sky you know if you can only set your wings you know today tonight this Sunday morning you know if you can only set your wings to the winds of faith you will see that you will fly in the highest more you will fly and those mountain that you see that you know being there in the tub you know and the bottom you see that the desired mountain that if you set your wings in God's in God's faith if you sent your wing your wings in the winds of faith you know you will see these mounted from a heaven point of view that's something that is not you know that like a little thing that like a little thing you know you will be able to overcome it you know then it's pretty dear Lord Lord we thank you Jesus cross we
