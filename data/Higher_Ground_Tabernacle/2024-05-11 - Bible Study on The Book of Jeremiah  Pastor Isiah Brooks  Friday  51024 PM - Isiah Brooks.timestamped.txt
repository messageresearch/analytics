[2:16] tonight and we appreciate those who are
[2:19] still
[2:20] coming I uh know the announcement
[2:24] perhaps got out late to some but yeah if
[2:26] we had service on Wednesday they should
[2:28] have known we were going to have
[2:30] service on
[2:33] Friday but as we
[2:36] stand
[2:38] um we ask that you turn with
[2:43] us we're still working with
[2:47] Ezekiel and uh we'll be uh coming out of
[2:52] excuse me I said Ezekiel I meant
[2:54] Jeremiah but we're going to jump a
[2:56] little bit and go to the 18th chapter of
[2:59] Jeremiah
[3:00] but before we get there we want to just
[3:03] uh give a scripture here uh according to
[3:08] habca and it reads habca
[3:12] 2123 I will stand upon my watch and set
[3:16] me upon the
[3:18] towel and I and will watch to see what
[3:22] he will say unto me and what I shall
[3:25] answer when I am am approved reproved
[3:28] excuse me
[3:30] and the Lord answered me and said write
[3:32] the vision and make it plain upon
[3:36] tables that he may run that readeth it
[3:40] for the vision is for is yet for an
[3:43] appointed time but at the end it shall
[3:47] speak and not lie though it t wait for
[3:52] it because it will surely come it will
[3:57] not
[3:58] t uh let's have a word of
[4:02] prayer our gracious father God we thank
[4:05] you for the reading of your word we
[4:07] thank you for being so good to us we
[4:10] thank you Father for just being all and
[4:12] all to us and we realize the more we
[4:16] journey the more we see you and father I
[4:19] thank you for the Amazing Grace that you
[4:22] have given unto us we pray that you
[4:24] bless Lord this uh service tonight bless
[4:28] it in a special way
[4:30] and father we'll be careful to give you
[4:32] the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus
[4:34] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[4:38] seated if you would turn with me to
[4:41] Jeremiah the 18th
[4:43] chapter uh we're going to read the 17th
[4:47] and the 18th verse
[4:49] there I know we I know we stopped around
[4:52] the uh 13th chapter uh and uh but we
[4:57] haven't forgotten about that but we just
[4:59] kind of want to just uh kind of give a a
[5:04] jump ahead and and perhaps we'll go back
[5:07] but I I wanted to to give you an idea of
[5:11] of the day that we're living in um why I
[5:14] believe that this this uh Jeremiah
[5:17] there's so many things that were
[5:19] happening in the in time of Jeremiah
[5:21] that that coincide with what we are
[5:24] going through uh we went through it
[5:28] earlier some of this where the people
[5:30] were so backsliding they just didn't
[5:33] couldn't hear the word of God and you
[5:35] got to realize we're not dealing with
[5:37] worldly people we're talking about
[5:39] Israel the church the church people were
[5:42] so backwards they were so fallen from
[5:45] God to not even the preachers were
[5:47] serving or the priests were serving God
[5:50] uh and and the thing about it is they
[5:52] thought that they could just live any
[5:54] kind of way and then come to church and
[5:56] God is going to sacrifice mean accept
[5:58] their sacrifice
[6:00] but um like I was saying just the other
[6:03] night worship and praise is two
[6:06] different thing in and everything can
[6:08] praise the Lord the tree can praise the
[6:10] Lord the but everything that have breath
[6:13] praise the Lord you know every animal
[6:15] Birds sings and all of these things but
[6:18] only only those who are called and
[6:21] selected or elected by God comes to a
[6:24] true worship and when when you come to a
[6:27] true worship that means that you have
[6:29] have surrendered unto the almighty God
[6:31] and now he's living in you you and him
[6:34] have become one and uh so but but you
[6:38] know you got to understand that God is a
[6:40] god of love God is a god of compassion
[6:43] but in all of that he still is a god of
[6:46] judgment and fire and I think a lot of
[6:48] times people take his kindness for
[6:51] granted you know I I used to have a
[6:54] sister I mean you know really she said
[6:57] well me and God got an understanding but
[7:00] God doesn't have an understanding other
[7:01] than his word and you got to understand
[7:04] the Bible wasn't put here to put us in
[7:07] bondage or to uh to Shackle us down or
[7:10] the the the word of God is here to
[7:13] protect us it is here to warn us it's
[7:16] here to direct us uh had not we Fallen
[7:20] uh we wouldn't have this written word as
[7:22] it is but because we have fallen God
[7:26] brought this written word so that we can
[7:28] read it understand understand it and
[7:30] know his thoughts about what his his I
[7:33] uh uh uh will is for us uh and and and
[7:37] to know that God controls everything uh
[7:40] but it seemed like Israel used to know
[7:43] that uh they come through uh great
[7:45] trials and temptations and uh you know
[7:48] God delivered them out of Egypt they saw
[7:50] the pill of fire they saw you know just
[7:53] the Angelic beings of God just
[7:56] performing miraculous things for them
[7:58] they saw how God fed them when they
[8:00] didn't have food you know they they saw
[8:03] how God clothed them kept their shoes
[8:05] and everything uh you know but down the
[8:09] road you had other religions other
[8:12] things that's why God say don't don't
[8:14] Worship in the way of the heathens you
[8:15] had Moab you had all of these other
[8:18] tribal people that worship their God and
[8:21] a lot of those those their worship uh
[8:24] you know I'm glad we're adults pretty
[8:25] much but a lot of their worship was
[8:27] sexual sins they offered up themselves
[8:30] they you know they offered up their
[8:32] children their babies and you name it it
[8:34] was just a a a worship of pleasure and
[8:37] that's what Satan is he is a God of
[8:40] Pleasure and anyway I'm saying all of
[8:43] these things to so just to give you a
[8:45] synopsis of what what God was trying to
[8:47] tell is Israel come back to
[8:51] me it's not like we went together and we
[8:54] were engaged but you you're my wife and
[8:57] he says come back to me I will accept
[9:00] you even as as bad as you've been I will
[9:04] accept you but the problem is is real
[9:07] didn't want to be accepted they actually
[9:10] wanted to just continue to do what they
[9:12] wanted to do because serving other gods
[9:14] were far more pleasurable it was a lot
[9:17] more fun it gave them temporary Joy you
[9:21] know and they failed to see that this
[9:23] life is temporal and it comes to an end
[9:27] and God is the only one that can give
[9:29] you everlasting life or eternal life so
[9:32] here in Jeremiah 181
[9:35] 17-18 says I will scatter them as with
[9:39] an East Wind before the enemy I will
[9:44] show them them the back and not the face
[9:48] in the day of their Calamity in other
[9:50] words God saying listen I I tried to
[9:52] call you I tried to woo you I did
[9:55] everything I could but you turn your
[9:57] back on me but basically he said now
[9:59] you're going to call on me one day and
[10:01] that's when I'm going to turn my back
[10:03] you won't see my face but you will see
[10:06] my back then said they come and let us
[10:11] devise
[10:12] devices against Jeremiah now I want you
[10:16] to consider what the message people have
[10:19] done in this last day we have had a
[10:21] prophet and we know the prophet is
[10:24] brother William brandham uh but we have
[10:27] we come to find out that in reality they
[10:30] hated what he taught they tried to cope
[10:34] with it they couldn't cope with it and
[10:37] and in turn they began to speak evil of
[10:40] it right now this is what they did to
[10:42] Jeremiah here they say come and let us
[10:45] devise devices against Jeremiah for the
[10:48] law shall not perish from the priest nor
[10:52] counsel from the wise nor the word from
[10:55] the Prophet come and let us Smite him
[10:58] with the tongue and let us not give heed
[11:00] to any of his words and that's what
[11:03] we've seen it was such a great Fallen
[11:05] away till they had all other priest they
[11:07] had other prophets they had they had all
[11:09] kinds of stuff uh going on almost like a
[11:12] Corinthian Church but
[11:15] nevertheless Jeremiah was the word for
[11:17] that day and instead of taking hold of
[11:20] the word of Jeremiah they believed that
[11:23] they were
[11:24] Invincible right so what are you saying
[11:26] that's the way message Believers believe
[11:29] we believe that we are invincible and
[11:31] don't don't get me wrong we are those
[11:33] are who are born again and got God in
[11:35] them they are but there are a lot of
[11:37] people believe that because we follow
[11:39] the message see just like Israel said
[11:41] you know I'm a Jew you know this Temple
[11:45] will never be destroyed Solomon said it
[11:47] will always be with us God told Solomon
[11:50] that right but at the same time God can
[11:54] do what he wants to do amen and
[11:56] everything has a time and everything has
[11:59] a season right but at the end of all
[12:02] season God comes out as the winner right
[12:06] somebody was saying something to me the
[12:08] other day and uh you know it says it
[12:11] just seemed like we we always come at at
[12:13] look like a loser I said well Jesus did
[12:16] too I said think about what he had to
[12:19] suffer they call him bebob he died a
[12:23] horrible death he did not die a a death
[12:27] of a a vict a Victor uh he died in sin
[12:30] and shame he was naked he was mocked
[12:35] di uh only on his cross you know it
[12:38] talks about how that he you know said he
[12:41] was the king of the Jews you know what
[12:43] I'm trying to say if you look at him he
[12:45] looked like he was a failure but what
[12:48] they did not understand is that there
[12:51] was another season
[12:54] coming I'm getting a little excited they
[12:57] didn't understand that there was another
[12:59] season coming right he had to die right
[13:03] but there was an appointed time he would
[13:05] be
[13:06] resurrected and though Jesus had died he
[13:09] could not come up from the
[13:11] grave at a at his own timing because the
[13:15] scripture said he had to lay in the
[13:17] ground for three days even as Jonah was
[13:21] in the well right so he couldn't just
[13:24] get up when he wanted to his spirit amen
[13:27] had gone back to God his soul went to
[13:30] hell and preached there and and you said
[13:33] but yet his body was
[13:36] dead and if you can see this it looked
[13:39] like the body of Jesus Christ is dead
[13:43] it's not dead there's a season for the
[13:47] resurrection and it will never happen
[13:50] until that that appointed time that God
[13:54] has appointed and he didn't give us a
[13:57] time but he said no man will know the
[13:59] day nor the hour that time has come he
[14:03] said the season as as the prophet God
[14:06] said we may not know the day nor the
[14:08] hour but we will know the season that's
[14:11] the scripture the Bible said I there's
[14:14] no need for me to teach you of the
[14:17] Season you'll know the season and all
[14:20] I'm trying to say is if if we can look
[14:23] at Jeremiah and see what they missed
[14:28] they missed the season of their
[14:31] judgment they missed the season of
[14:34] escaping they missed the season of God's
[14:37] mercy they missed the season of God's
[14:40] grace and it seems like Jeremiah died a
[14:45] loser but everything Jeremiah prophesied
[14:49] came to
[14:51] pass you see what I'm saying and that's
[14:53] the way they look at brother Brandman
[14:55] look how could he be a prophet he died
[14:57] in a car accident it may look like he
[15:00] died as a loser y'all hear what I'm
[15:02] saying but he died as a winner how do
[15:05] you know that we is on tape the message
[15:08] reach reached home that's that was an
[15:11] important thing that everybody that's
[15:15] ordained to hear this message will hear
[15:17] it because it's on books and tapes and
[15:19] is in the word so I said all of this to
[15:23] say watch the attitude of the people
[15:26] even in this church people don't want
[15:29] believe what brother bam said is true
[15:31] some think it's a fairy tale some think
[15:33] it's his his uh that's his
[15:36] opinion and they fail to see they fall
[15:39] right into the Trap of the
[15:41] enemy and when you resist the word of
[15:44] God in such a way God can't help you cuz
[15:47] he sent you the greatest gift that he
[15:49] could give outside of himself and that's
[15:52] a prophet with the
[15:54] word people don't understand God calling
[15:58] to to the Jewish people calling to him
[16:00] now remember God said because you won't
[16:04] answer I'm going to scatter you did God
[16:07] scatter him absolutely just like he said
[16:11] at an appointed time God scattered him
[16:14] Jesus before he was crucified he warned
[16:18] his disciples the judgment is coming on
[16:20] Israel the judgment is coming on
[16:23] Jerusalem for what they did for
[16:26] crucifying the son of God he told them
[16:30] judgment is coming he said when you see
[16:33] the armies encamped about circling
[16:37] Jerusalem he said
[16:39] flee when you see them coming flee to
[16:43] the mountain hide
[16:45] yourself and those who heard the
[16:47] scripture heard the preaching was able
[16:50] to escape but all of the ones who did
[16:53] not when Titus
[16:56] came he destroyed them he killed them it
[17:01] it's the same thing that Babylon did
[17:03] Babylon tore the walls down burnt the
[17:05] city and
[17:07] everybody that would not humble himself
[17:10] to the king of Babylon
[17:12] died now I'm just telling you we are now
[17:16] living in almost the same kind of
[17:19] situation here and the thing about it is
[17:22] you can preach warning you can preach
[17:24] judgment and and the people can't hear
[17:26] you cuz their minds on something
[17:28] something else there's another voice in
[17:30] the land that's telling the people you
[17:32] all
[17:33] right you going to be
[17:36] okay you don't have to worry about
[17:38] nothing in a way that's
[17:41] true but the Bible also says watch and
[17:47] pray that your father will count you
[17:49] what worthy Amen to escape the wrath
[17:52] that is to come is the Wrath coming is
[17:55] coming
[17:57] amen and now that the Gentiles are
[18:00] uniting
[18:01] together around Israel where's that
[18:04] going to put
[18:08] us we don't know how soon but we know it
[18:13] soon and it behooves us like I was
[18:16] saying the other day Matthew 25 had us
[18:20] inspired to do one thing answer the
[18:24] voice of the
[18:25] call there was a Midnight Cry and 10
[18:30] virgins woke up they all slumbered and
[18:33] slept five of them were wise and five
[18:36] was foolish the wise amen they made sure
[18:40] they had allil and extra oil what is
[18:42] that they made sure they had the Holy
[18:44] Ghost and the word extra in their
[18:47] vessels amen and the old foolish amen
[18:51] thought church was good enough let me
[18:54] tell you something church is not good
[18:56] enough this church can't save you
[18:59] there's only one Savior and that's the
[19:01] Lord Jesus
[19:02] Christ no church can save you just like
[19:05] they thought in in in Israel they
[19:08] thought oh if we could just hide in the
[19:10] city of Jerusalem amen we'll be safe
[19:14] they were not
[19:16] safe it was a
[19:18] trap because the one who they should
[19:21] have put trust in which was Jesus Christ
[19:24] they missed
[19:25] him and what happened when the enemy
[19:28] came came in like a flood there was no
[19:30] standard they all
[19:33] died babies and all it got so play so
[19:37] bad in Israel to you know especially
[19:39] Jerusalem till they were eating their
[19:41] own children eating their men servants
[19:44] everything God cursed them with it
[19:47] happened let me tell y'all something
[19:50] people are now in our day now don't you
[19:53] ever think they
[19:54] won't they turned calistic overnight I
[19:58] know I I know somebody might even be
[19:59] laughing about this right now but it's
[20:01] no funny matter it's not a laughing
[20:04] matter cuz most of this generation is
[20:06] insane
[20:08] anyhow he said go ahead and and Jeremiah
[20:11] 33 and three turn with there quickly
[20:14] we'll come back Jeremiah 33
[20:20] and3 you see in all in all of God's
[20:24] judgment he still offers that mercy and
[20:28] Grace but don't you know there's a
[20:30] line once you cross the
[20:33] line there's no
[20:36] more he can only continue he could you
[20:39] know he he Woos you he C he calls you he
[20:42] call but when you constantly turn your
[20:44] back on him that's where're in it
[20:47] everybody just thank God Amen his grace
[20:49] and mercy is with us
[20:52] amen yeah many of us sometime want to
[20:54] quit or walk away or do something that's
[20:57] not quite s
[20:59] but at the same time there's something
[21:01] in our heart makes us know where else
[21:03] we're going to
[21:05] go and who going to Love Me Like Jesus
[21:10] Hallelujah Jeremiah said listen it says
[21:13] call unto me and I will answer thee and
[21:16] show thee Great and Mighty things which
[21:20] thou knowest not think about
[21:24] that you rather love this world and the
[21:27] things of the world like like like
[21:29] Israel did there therefore I
[21:32] example and you're going to let this tie
[21:35] you
[21:36] down people said well brother random
[21:39] said if I knew the Rapture was coming
[21:41] I'll plant my corn anyway plant your
[21:43] corn plant your potatoes but make sure
[21:46] that your heart is in the kingdom and
[21:48] the kingdom is in your heart amen you
[21:50] can do whatever you want to take
[21:52] whatever trip you want to do whatever
[21:54] you want to as long as you know you have
[21:57] met the requir ments that the token has
[22:01] been
[22:03] applied but I feel that a lot of people
[22:06] the token has not yet been
[22:09] applied and the thing about it is we
[22:13] fail to see that everything has a time
[22:14] and a season some of us just don't have
[22:17] the patience to wait on God you have to
[22:20] wait on God and wait for God and that
[22:22] was Israel problem it wasn't that God
[22:24] wasn't blessing them it's that that they
[22:27] their their how could I say said church
[22:30] had became a boore CH church had become
[22:34] common they didn't love God the way they
[22:36] used to the the sacrifices that they
[22:39] they would bring to God a lot of them
[22:41] were were were were mimed and lame it it
[22:44] became a business you know what I'm
[22:46] saying like a lot of the churches have
[22:48] become business and a lot of things have
[22:51] become like a system of worship and God
[22:54] hates all of that you're not the first
[22:57] and where never be we may be the last of
[23:00] this Gentile age to do that but that's
[23:04] what Israel did Israel was such a system
[23:07] when Jesus Christ came they missed him
[23:11] you know why because the system blind
[23:14] them to the truth am and that's what has
[23:17] happened in this message and I have to
[23:19] say it like this it has blinded a lot of
[23:21] people with the truth they believe
[23:23] because I believe the message I'm going
[23:25] to heaven no sir no ma'am the devil
[23:28] believes the
[23:30] message Hallelujah it got to go beyond
[23:33] belief have you received the Holy Ghost
[23:36] since you believe Hallelujah That's
[23:39] Where It's At Hallelujah now you say
[23:42] well what do you mean let me tell you
[23:43] something is we have to learn how to
[23:45] wait the Bible says
[23:48] it how it goes um in our patience
[23:53] possess ye our souls and right now it's
[23:56] calling for a lot of patience
[23:58] cuz we want the move of God Amen we want
[24:01] we want that anointing God promised it
[24:03] to us he going to give it to us we don't
[24:05] have to worry about it he's going to
[24:07] give it to us we can't force his hand we
[24:10] can't make him do it is that right
[24:13] because remember though Moses was chosen
[24:16] to deliver the children of Israel Moses
[24:20] thought because of his teaching his mama
[24:22] taught him that but because of his
[24:24] teaching he thought he can deliver the
[24:26] children of Israel when he wanted to
[24:29] and what happened he ended up killing a
[24:32] man he became a murderer because he was
[24:35] out of season yall understand me that's
[24:39] why it's so important to preach the word
[24:40] in season you know it's
[24:44] like I like like for instance I take the
[24:47] world they preach that Prosperity
[24:51] Gospel find it in the
[24:57] message this ain't about that this is
[25:00] about making Heaven my home
[25:04] amen if God listen Abraham didn't have
[25:07] to do nothing God because of his grace
[25:10] blessed
[25:12] Abraham what did job do nothing but
[25:16] believe God and offered up the
[25:20] sacrifice that's all stay under the
[25:23] blood you stay under the blood God will
[25:26] bless you that's the way it works seek
[25:30] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[25:32] righteousness and God will add all of
[25:34] these things to you this ain't a time to
[25:36] be
[25:37] distracted remember Moses born for the
[25:41] work coming from the
[25:44] message spoken word is Original Seed
[25:48] 62 paragraph 373 remember Moses born of
[25:53] the work for the work had to wait on God
[25:56] for an extra gift for the job he had to
[25:59] go back and wait and for the time
[26:04] appointed by God a certain Pharaoh had
[26:08] to be on the throne and the people had
[26:11] to be wanting the bread of life before
[26:14] God would send him
[26:16] back did he say a certain Pharaoh had to
[26:19] be on the throne right and before this
[26:23] thing can fully W wind up am everything
[26:26] must be in position
[26:29] Ahab must be there Jezebel must be there
[26:34] right everything has to be in order
[26:36] can't happen before or soon you know
[26:39] sooner or whatever it's like God has an
[26:41] appointed
[26:43] time now with thousand signs and workers
[26:46] in the last days has created a
[26:48] generation of sign Seekers that knows no
[26:51] more nothing about the true move of God
[26:54] now you say well brother what that got
[26:55] to do with with us with Jeremiah
[26:57] Jeremiah had false prophets among him
[26:59] too amen and they could do signs and
[27:02] wonders they prophesied and they had
[27:04] they captivated all of all of Israel and
[27:06] all of the Elders of that day Jeremiah
[27:09] was trying to tell them you're going to
[27:11] die Israel going to be uh uh uh
[27:14] imprison and Jerusalem and this Temple
[27:17] is going to be
[27:19] destroyed sound familiar Jesus said if
[27:22] you destroy this temple in 3 days I'll
[27:24] raise it up and they thought he was just
[27:27] talking about his body
[27:28] but he knew he knew that Titus was
[27:31] coming down the road and that's what
[27:34] people don't understand God always hid
[27:36] himself implicity but he's still the
[27:38] same Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[27:40] today and forever if we get off track
[27:43] like they did in Jeremiah's day God's
[27:46] judgment will be the same that's the way
[27:49] it works and I'm reading this because I
[27:51] want you to focus right now and that
[27:54] maybe I'm out of my mind but I believe
[27:56] with all of my heart that our
[27:58] translation our Rapture is not far from
[28:00] here and I don't know why you don't feel
[28:03] it I can't understand why people not
[28:05] feeling the way I feel it but I feel it
[28:08] and one of the things that God has
[28:09] elated me with is that God is Not
[28:13] examining me he's examined My Sacrifice
[28:16] and My Sacrifice is perfect and I'm
[28:19] accepted in the Beloved my airing ways
[28:23] he knew before he saved me Hallelujah
[28:26] there's only one perfect man in and
[28:28] that's Jesus Christ himself but as long
[28:31] as I trust in that sacrifice
[28:35] Hallelujah I know I'll make
[28:38] it that's my that's where I laid my hand
[28:42] I lay my hand on the sacrifice of Jesus
[28:45] Christ but people say well brother
[28:47] Brooks you go ahead
[28:48] on I want to say I want to tell y'all so
[28:51] much so many things but I cannot but
[28:54] I'll tell you I'll tell you like this
[28:57] I'm not against anybody but I have a
[29:00] work to do and my work is to try to get
[29:03] to this church to Jesus Christ to get
[29:06] them to the Holy Ghost yall understand
[29:08] me my that's what I come here to do I
[29:11] don't come here to try to tell you how
[29:13] to do how to do nothing how to be this
[29:15] or how to be that I'm trying to get the
[29:17] people to know how to be the Christian
[29:19] that's what I've been called to do and I
[29:22] will have to give an account for that
[29:26] right I'm just saying
[29:29] because I you know where there's two
[29:31] spirits in the church two of them right
[29:35] and as it said in Matthew 24 two Spirits
[29:37] were close alike to see the very elected
[29:40] if
[29:42] possible and I'm going tell you
[29:44] something let me tell you something if
[29:45] you think that this church is absence of
[29:48] the two Spirits you got it all
[29:53] wrong I don't know what people came here
[29:55] to America for and I don't know why
[29:58] people in America what they thinking
[30:00] about but I'm going tell you something
[30:03] God orchestrates
[30:05] everything and everything is moving by
[30:07] the power of God Amen and I'm going tell
[30:10] you like this you may not believe it but
[30:13] I know who I am I know what I've been
[30:15] called to do and I'm going tell you
[30:17] something there's a lot of people who
[30:19] don't have the voice or ear to hear
[30:21] what's being preach from this pull
[30:24] pit it's like a Jeremiah All Over Again
[30:28] and instead of liking me they hate me
[30:31] just like they hated Jeremiah but I'm
[30:33] going tell you something I'm going to
[30:34] preach the truth as much as
[30:38] possible as much as possible I'm not
[30:40] going to bend I'm not going to Bow and
[30:42] neither will I break because I know I
[30:45] gotta meet him and y'all can y'all can
[30:49] all congregate together and want to jump
[30:51] me and I tell you what I will fear Him
[30:53] still the
[30:55] most how could I tell them give them the
[30:58] word test
[31:00] see now I look at people I says
[31:04] okay did we are the
[31:08] bride we know what the Bible said the
[31:11] love of many shall wax
[31:13] worse the cares of this life Matthew 13
[31:16] I believe it is the cares of this life
[31:18] would
[31:19] choke why would he put that in there but
[31:22] there were those who fell on good
[31:25] ground and they brought forth aund f F
[31:28] why because they were not distracted by
[31:31] the world
[31:34] Amen what what good would a profit a man
[31:37] to gain the whole world and lose his
[31:41] soul you know what you know I'mma know
[31:43] when I don't know a a Revival is going
[31:45] on when I see people bringing new people
[31:48] in the
[31:51] door don't tell me oh I'm in Revival and
[31:54] you ain't
[31:56] witnessing when you when Revival is
[31:59] going in on you you got to tell
[32:02] somebody or try to tell somebody whether
[32:05] they come or not you going to tell
[32:09] somebody right and that's that's that's
[32:12] what I'm talking about so let's move on
[32:14] by the grace of God I won't finish that
[32:16] but uh let's let's go back to Jeremiah
[32:18] please let's just touch on a little bit
[32:21] on the 13th chapter I believe it is you
[32:23] love the Lord
[32:32] what what can we say there's so much to
[32:35] be
[32:36] said and you know somebody brought it to
[32:39] my attention you know wanting to evening
[32:42] service on Sunday I'm like I would love
[32:45] that but I don't know whether anybody
[32:47] would
[32:49] come people have gotten so lazy and and
[32:52] and all they think about is you know
[32:56] doing their pleasure but to
[33:00] me I could say it like this the word of
[33:04] God says I was glad when they said unto
[33:08] me let us go into the house of the
[33:12] Lord I enjoy church I enjoy hearing the
[33:17] word I enjoy being in that presence
[33:21] where God Amen be mer where he is
[33:23] merciful to us right now look look what
[33:27] the 13 chapter Jeremiah says thus said
[33:29] the Lord unto me go and get the a linen
[33:31] girl and put it upon the loin and put
[33:34] not in water so I got a a girdle in
[33:37] according to the word of the Lord and I
[33:39] put it on the loins and the word of the
[33:41] Lord came unto me the second time saying
[33:43] take the girdle that thou has got which
[33:45] is upon the loin and arise go to
[33:48] Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of
[33:51] the of the rock so I went and hid it by
[33:54] Euphrates and as the Lord commanded me
[33:57] and came to pass after many days that
[34:00] the Lord said unto me arise go to
[34:03] Euphrates and take the girdle from Vin
[34:05] which I commanded thee to hide there I
[34:08] went to the fres and digged and took the
[34:10] girdle from the place where I hid it and
[34:13] behold the girdle was marred it was
[34:15] profitable for nothing then the word of
[34:18] the Lord came unto me saying thus said
[34:20] the Lord after this manner will I Mar
[34:24] the pride of Judah and the great pride
[34:28] of Jerusalem so what is he
[34:31] saying it was their
[34:33] pride that caused the condition that
[34:35] they were in and I've been to Jerusalem
[34:39] and I'm going tell you most of the Jews
[34:41] that I ran into or or I put it this way
[34:44] there were some Jews I won't say most
[34:45] that was you could tell the spirit of
[34:47] Pride on them don't do know they that's
[34:50] been one of their issues with all the
[34:52] others you know we're the chosen ones
[34:55] and you're nothing but that's not the
[34:57] way way God intended it to be we're the
[35:00] chosen one but we're here to help you
[35:03] not to step on you you see and I'm all
[35:07] for Israel but take a take the message
[35:11] or what we call the bride of Christ
[35:13] we've done the same thing and that's
[35:16] exactly what the Pharisees and the
[35:17] Sadducees did the same
[35:20] thing it was a low class people we
[35:23] weren't concerned
[35:25] about that's not what the gospel is here
[35:27] here
[35:28] for if we can't show love and concern
[35:32] toward those that are without God don't
[35:35] like that you're full of Pride and God
[35:39] don't like
[35:40] Pride he said this evil people which
[35:43] refuse to hear my words which walk in
[35:46] the imagination of their heart and walk
[35:49] after other gods to serve them and to
[35:52] worship them shall even be as this
[35:55] girdle which is good for for nothing now
[35:58] let me tell you something when God calls
[36:00] you good for nothing you're good for
[36:02] nothing but I'm the I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[36:05] a Jew I'm Israel you know I'm I'm Judah
[36:10] you know what I mean I'm from jerus you
[36:12] know they who you going to boast to even
[36:15] when Paul was go boasting in Corinthians
[36:18] he said excuse me of my Folly but I'm
[36:21] going to boast a little bit I'm an
[36:25] Israelite I'm from The Tribe of Benjamin
[36:27] and you know how he went through all of
[36:30] that but he can't come to conclude that
[36:33] I but I'm
[36:35] nothing and that's what we must
[36:37] understand until we see ourselves as
[36:39] nothing it's easy to fall into this
[36:42] trap easy to fall and God is like now
[36:47] right now God is still trying to woo us
[36:50] to the
[36:52] Cross he's still trying to get us to see
[36:56] how much he love us and you know what
[36:58] we're so captivated by
[37:01] Pleasure we're caught in a snare and
[37:04] only God can break the
[37:05] snare I heard brother brandom say today
[37:08] in I think it's choosing of a bride or
[37:10] whatever I was reading he said
[37:13] listen he said I might have that on my
[37:16] notes he said the problem is we always
[37:20] trying to do something we always trying
[37:23] to help him you know God don't need your
[37:26] help
[37:28] we always trying to fix it but God don't
[37:31] need you to fix
[37:33] it he don't need you to fix it it's
[37:36] already fixed but the problem is we
[37:38] don't know how to yield we need to learn
[37:41] how to
[37:43] surrender and I mean just get on your
[37:45] knees at some point in time says Lord
[37:47] help me to surrender and you don't stop
[37:50] until God
[37:52] comes you think about the prophet of God
[37:54] how many times he sat in a bush praying
[37:57] for you young lady with mosquitoes all
[37:59] about him for
[38:01] hours waiting on
[38:04] God and how God told him listen you're
[38:07] going to have so many squirrels and how
[38:09] many hours he had to wait out there and
[38:12] when he got tired and thought well this
[38:14] will be enough but God said you
[38:17] said right so you can't even back off of
[38:20] your word when you speak something you
[38:22] got to believe it how you expect God to
[38:25] receive it if you don't even believe it
[38:26] you saying something just right off your
[38:28] lip no it must come from your heart and
[38:31] you must believe
[38:33] it listen he says he says I trust that
[38:38] the church will understand this that we
[38:40] have no right to use our own thinking
[38:43] about things when we become Christians
[38:46] we totally surrender every bit of your
[38:48] mental power to God and follow after his
[38:51] leading as long as we try to go after
[38:55] our own feelings then we are using the
[38:59] Fallen state of the being because God
[39:02] LED Adam before the fall and after the
[39:05] fall Adam wanted to lead God now God is
[39:10] that right we always trying to tell God
[39:12] what he should do and what he shouldn't
[39:13] do and I think that's the same trap
[39:15] Israel fell into because maybe God
[39:18] wasn't answering their prayers or doing
[39:20] what they God wanted God to do they
[39:22] sought in their own way to do what they
[39:25] want to do and even the scripture say
[39:28] it became so bad to every man was right
[39:30] in his own eyes and that's the way it
[39:33] goes now God provided Adam away but he
[39:37] didn't want that way he wanted to make
[39:39] himself a religion as we say that he
[39:42] wanted to do it himself he wasn't
[39:45] willing to wait on God and say Lord you
[39:48] led me before this see waiting on God
[39:51] with the confidence that God LED you
[39:53] before and now I'm Fallen I'm lost and
[39:57] now help me and show me how to get back
[40:00] to you Lord we have never had all this
[40:04] trouble we got today and if a man would
[40:08] just come that close to God that when
[40:11] you're lost don't try to find your way
[40:13] back just surrender to him and he will
[40:17] lead you back don't try to figure it out
[40:20] that's that's the mental p uh Powers I
[40:23] said some time ago in a meeting I said
[40:26] in the garden of Eden God and the devil
[40:29] chose the their parts of the man the
[40:31] devil took his head and God took his
[40:34] heart the devil tries to show him with
[40:38] his mental power some great something he
[40:40] can do and and he only wants to see with
[40:44] his eyes what he can see Ain that right
[40:47] that's how we base our faith I got to
[40:49] see it no faith is when you don't see it
[40:53] yet you believe amen it's it's the
[40:55] ability to take God at his word you
[40:58] can't see it happening you don't see it
[41:00] materializing but you believe God and
[41:04] the just shall live by faith not by
[41:06] feelings amen I don't feel like God
[41:08] loved me what is that what is that I
[41:12] mean you got job who felt that way job
[41:15] said I cursed the day I was
[41:18] born Nehemiah said I mean Jeremiah said
[41:21] Lord why didn't that man the man who
[41:23] delivered me or or whoever deliver why
[41:25] didn't you just kill me while in my
[41:26] birth
[41:28] that's how hard times were but it
[41:30] doesn't take away your election amen God
[41:34] knew you he knows you that's right it
[41:37] doesn't take away your Christianity
[41:39] because you fail in
[41:41] God but God is saying
[41:44] repent
[41:46] surrender that's what he wants we do not
[41:49] want to be like listen if you don't
[41:51] believe that that bomb is coming
[41:54] something's wrong with
[41:56] you and what other person who ever told
[41:58] us that was the prophet of
[42:00] Elijah he told us our end he told us
[42:04] what was going to happen to this place
[42:06] and whether they will agree with it or
[42:08] not it's going to happen Amen in its
[42:13] season at its appointed time is going to
[42:16] happen my question is how are you going
[42:19] to
[42:21] escape cuz with every Temptation the
[42:23] Bible said God makes a way of Escape
[42:27] and our way of Escape has been given to
[42:31] us through Malachi 4 showing us the way
[42:34] back to the true Jesus Christ who is the
[42:41] word and and the only way you can you
[42:43] can you can follow this correctly you
[42:46] got to die to your own thinking
[42:50] amen see he said listen for faith is the
[42:53] substance of things hoped for the
[42:55] evidence of things not seen he just
[42:58] believed it
[43:01] who because God said it he don't have to
[43:05] see nothing or no sense of his body has
[43:09] to declare it he just believe it in his
[43:12] soul where God God lives but the devil
[43:16] took his head make him smart figure out
[43:19] himself out of religion a way of Escape
[43:23] God wants wants to lead him to the path
[43:26] of worship
[43:28] see so I said all of this and I'm I'mma
[43:32] close in just a
[43:33] bit but I want to say this until you
[43:37] truly believe you're saved and TR and
[43:40] truly believe God is in you and I don't
[43:42] mean feeling
[43:44] it because you don't have to feel God
[43:46] all the time but you got to believe he's
[43:49] there and if you believe that he's there
[43:52] he can take you out of every ditch that
[43:54] you're in amen whatever you may be
[43:57] fallen to God can pick you up but you
[44:01] got to trust to God in
[44:04] you he leads and guides you and that's
[44:07] the thing is you know we we we we see
[44:10] Jeremiah and we see what happened to him
[44:12] and to them and I I can almost see God
[44:15] pleading and that's what Jesus did on
[44:18] the cross that's why his arms are wide
[44:20] open he's forever
[44:23] saying come unto me all those who are
[44:28] Laden and heavy lader labor labor and
[44:31] heavy laden come unto me and I will give
[44:33] you rest for your soul right but look
[44:36] what they're doing they're trying to
[44:39] destroy the word they're trying to
[44:41] destroy the Christian they're trying to
[44:43] destroy Israel don't y'all understand
[44:47] and
[44:48] all of this has been ordained by God
[44:53] because they fail to keep the word amen
[44:58] America my country that I love is now
[45:03] suffering licks because I think in 1956
[45:07] 19557 she turned her back on the Living
[45:11] God and judgment is now striking us from
[45:15] every corner and the World At Large
[45:19] hates
[45:22] us why there was a time we didn't have
[45:25] to worry about nobody
[45:28] cuz we had enough God that would protect
[45:31] us but when we decided to kick him out
[45:34] in Revelations 3 put him out of the
[45:36] church he ain't in most of those
[45:38] churches put him out they got the bands
[45:42] they got the choir they got all of the
[45:44] music they got all of the beautiful
[45:46] stuff amen and you better believe it
[45:48] Israel knew how to worship they had all
[45:51] of
[45:52] that all of
[45:54] that but they had everything but but
[45:58] God and that's what you don't want to
[46:00] have everything but God you want to have
[46:03] God and be nothing have nothing if you
[46:06] don't if that what it takes people said
[46:08] wait a minute let me tell y'all
[46:10] something and I'm closing I I just kind
[46:12] of just put everything together because
[46:14] I want you I want to say that's the way
[46:17] it
[46:18] is and every time you engage yourself to
[46:21] a system that system has a way of
[46:24] blinding you to the word
[46:30] you see you gota you got you you know
[46:32] even when I preach I don't tell you not
[46:33] to examine what I preach examine what I
[46:37] preach see if your Holy Ghost Say Amen
[46:39] or it doesn't if I'm preaching something
[46:42] and your Holy Ghost is not saying amen
[46:43] you obligated to talk to me but brother
[46:46] books I don't see it that way why do you
[46:47] see we need to sit down and have a
[46:49] conference or discuss it cuz you need my
[46:52] point is this we need to see what day
[46:55] and time it is amen it's Way Beyond time
[46:59] I think God is just waiting on that last
[47:01] one
[47:03] amen how many more going to
[47:06] come and because you f your church up
[47:09] now am I wrong brother brandham
[47:12] said after the Rapture there'll be a lot
[47:15] of people left behind calling on the
[47:18] name of Jesus thinking that they're
[47:20] being
[47:21] saved he said it they won't even know
[47:24] the Rapture is taking place until the
[47:26] tribulation hits and they're going to
[47:29] say well we thought the tribulation was
[47:31] supposed to the routch supposed to come
[47:32] he said yes and it already
[47:35] passed so we know it ain't the way the
[47:38] denominations is describing this thing
[47:41] that everybody going to see him no
[47:43] that's that's that's the that that's the
[47:45] second Resurrection when he comes
[47:47] everybody going to see him when I say
[47:49] the second Resurrection when he comes on
[47:51] the cloud with the with the saints of
[47:53] God every eye shall see him yeah but but
[47:57] this time is a
[47:59] thief he's a thief and there are many
[48:03] people that are missing right to this
[48:04] day and nobody know where they went
[48:06] nobody knows where they're going
[48:08] thousands of people a day nobody knows
[48:11] in the Rapture be just like that they
[48:14] won't know until the tribulation hits
[48:18] now in closing CU I I'm jumping to the
[48:21] end because there's more to Jeremiah
[48:23] than than the the end of of Jerusalem
[48:26] when they burned him and you know
[48:28] zedekiah you know you'll remember the
[48:30] false prophets and what he did there and
[48:34] he calls a whole
[48:36] nation to be impr prisoned because of
[48:40] his false
[48:43] prophecies Jeremiah was trying to make
[48:46] them aware of what was coming I think a
[48:50] zedekiah I think I've been saying his
[48:52] name wrong he's the one says don't
[48:54] listen to Jeremiah
[48:58] you see it ain't going to
[49:00] happen and he took that yoke of wood off
[49:03] his neck and broke
[49:06] it and then God said tell zedi that they
[49:10] I put a a yoke of iron on his neck
[49:13] now you understand me because of what he
[49:16] did it's going to be
[49:17] worse and
[49:19] and what was
[49:21] happening the people were so rich and
[49:24] busy they wouldn't pay their tithing
[49:27] they wouldn't let the land rest they
[49:29] didn't honor the Sabbath like a lot of
[49:31] people and when you don't honor the
[49:32] Sabbath spiritually that means you don't
[49:34] honor the Holy Ghost you don't have
[49:39] it they didn't honor the Sabbath they
[49:42] didn't let the land rest and other
[49:45] things and because they didn't God said
[49:47] for 70
[49:49] years you going to be in
[49:52] bondage that was their penalty but God
[49:55] also says I'm going to bring you
[49:58] out you hear what I'm saying
[50:02] now we know by the grace of
[50:05] God that right now we're
[50:08] facing what we know the Captivity of
[50:12] Israel all over the world they in
[50:15] bondage they are in
[50:17] Babylon being ruled by a devil brother
[50:21] vom said one of these old days you're
[50:23] going to find out that it wasn't Jesus
[50:25] Christ who you were worshiping
[50:29] and a lot of these churches they don't
[50:31] understand who they worshiping because
[50:33] the Bible said you got to worship me in
[50:34] spirit and in truth and if you can see
[50:37] the spiritual application of what
[50:38] happened what is happening now the king
[50:41] of Babylon is already got them in such a
[50:44] fix they have no idea what they
[50:49] doing but we the bride of Jesus Christ
[50:52] we
[50:53] know you and I need to go home somebody
[50:56] need to go go listen to the message
[50:58] desperation cuz ain't nobody seem I
[51:00] won't say ain't nobody but there are
[51:02] many people they're not thinking about
[51:03] being desperate or even trying to get
[51:06] there there's some things I wanted to
[51:08] say I didn't say but I'll say it like
[51:11] this God has an appointed
[51:14] time keep crying out before the Lord
[51:18] keep surrendering to the Lord and God
[51:21] will surely answer your
[51:23] prayer yes brother
[51:35] amen
[51:38] amen yes
[51:41] sir it has an anointing on it and at
[51:45] some point in time that same anointing
[51:48] that's on that tape will will come upon
[51:51] you that's why God preached it and the
[51:54] bride of Christ shall come to understand
[51:57] what that's for like somebody says you
[51:59] want to be healed well take this
[52:02] medicine right it's already prepared for
[52:04] you and that's what these messages are
[52:08] medicine gospels amen and they're there
[52:11] to give us health and strength and to
[52:14] revive us and I believe that tape is
[52:17] there to revive us to to put us in that
[52:20] channel because we can't do it on our
[52:23] own you understand me so let's
[52:28] stand remember God
[52:32] said if you call upon me I'll give you
[52:36] things that you can't even imagine I'll
[52:39] give it it'll come by the grace of God
[52:43] but he said he'll give it do you believe
[52:44] that I believe it I believe it right now
[52:48] everybody in here going through some
[52:50] crazy
[52:51] stuff you don't have to tell me I know
[52:54] it
[52:56] financially and everything else it it it
[52:59] is it's hitting in
[53:00] everybody you don't feel like you're
[53:03] left out but one thing for certain we
[53:06] come together to do what to be
[53:07] strengthened by the word the Bible said
[53:10] in the day that day you see the day
[53:14] approaching come together the more amen
[53:17] don't let the devil get you all well I
[53:20] I've been there
[53:23] Wednesday yeah that's the way people
[53:26] thing you know what I mean oh he going
[53:29] to preach the same thing you know so
[53:31] many things people say but just what did
[53:34] Brother brandom say he did that man kept
[53:37] preaching repentance and the one person
[53:40] said why you keep preaching repentance
[53:42] he said I keep pre preaching repentance
[53:44] until they repent he said then when they
[53:46] repent I'll preach something else that's
[53:48] the way the art of God why should I tell
[53:51] you to something new something deep when
[53:53] God can't get us to do what he's telling
[53:55] us to do right off
[53:57] why can't people see that they are the
[54:00] reasons for the
[54:02] seeson you understand me God going to
[54:05] give you what you need not what you want
[54:08] and God has been giving us certain
[54:10] messages I know you say well what are
[54:12] you saying brother I that's why you
[54:14] can't tell me there's not a lot of
[54:15] people in this church that don't need
[54:17] need the we need him
[54:19] amen people that need in this church
[54:21] need to be
[54:23] saved they're not Christians
[54:26] but you you they'll never own up to
[54:29] it and I'm going tell you something you
[54:32] know until we
[54:34] Witnesses I'm a
[54:37] witness if if they should come short I'm
[54:40] a witness I'll be a witness against them
[54:43] Lord I preached
[54:44] it and they oh he didn't God press press
[54:50] press
[54:54] play you know what I'm saying is the
[54:57] truth it's being
[54:59] recorded and that's what people don't
[55:01] understand God in Simplicity trying to
[55:04] get the people es I believe with all my
[55:07] heart and I'm trying to close but I
[55:08] believe with all my heart this church is
[55:11] a gold mind but the goal is no good as
[55:15] long as it has draw in it and God is
[55:18] going to send that fire he going to give
[55:20] that fire and I'm telling you for those
[55:22] who can be saved they're going to go
[55:24] through something they may have I don't
[55:25] know what it is but they going to break
[55:28] cuz I don't believe God gathered these
[55:30] people here for nothing I do not and I
[55:33] believe that there will be a Revival in
[55:36] this assembly if nowhere
[55:38] else I believe that that's what I'm
[55:40] praying for and that's what I'm
[55:42] believing we we and I'm going to finish
[55:45] uh try to try to work Jeremiah just a
[55:48] couple of more more Fridays if you just
[55:50] have the patience with me and and and
[55:52] and we got to see exact I want to get
[55:54] everything out of this that God wants us
[55:57] to hear it is a long book but I want to
[55:59] get everything out of here that God
[56:01] wants us to hear because I don't believe
[56:04] I'm anointed to do this book for nothing
[56:07] and I really appreciate uh uh brother
[56:10] Liz Paul when he preached on Ezra
[56:12] because it it tied right in see these
[56:14] people they didn't change and and don't
[56:17] even think because we're Gentiles we're
[56:18] better matter of fact we were
[56:21] dogs God has changed that and so one
[56:24] more thing you are not a sinner saved by
[56:30] grace you cannot be a sinner and a saint
[56:34] amen and what makes us a saint is not
[56:37] our works but what his words say we are
[56:42] amen you understand me so don't don't as
[56:45] long as you think you are a sinner
[56:47] that's the way you going to behave but
[56:49] you got to elevate your mind to believe
[56:52] I'm a true son and daughter of God and
[56:55] the life life that's in me is changing
[56:58] me from glory to
[57:00] glory you see oh don't give excuses for
[57:04] your
[57:06] flesh because God has made you a new
[57:09] creature and you got to recognize that
[57:11] you are but because of this sometime
[57:14] it's difficult to see but we don't go by
[57:17] sight we don't go by smell taste and Fe
[57:20] we go by the word and all the life in
[57:23] you right now that little pin head of
[57:25] God in you is trying to get you to
[57:28] completely surrender to him that's the
[57:30] victory that is the victory that
[57:33] overcomes that we surrender totally to
[57:35] God and not allow ourselves to become
[57:38] like the people in Jeremiah and Ezra and
[57:42] all of those uh places where they were
[57:44] Malachi just
[57:46] rebellious I do not want to come before
[57:49] God as a
[57:51] rebel you love the Lord let's pray
[57:54] father God we come before you Lord Jesus
[57:56] as humbly as we know how we thank you
[57:59] for your grace and your mercy we thank
[58:00] you for this time lord just little bits
[58:03] and pieces out of Jeremiah Lord that we
[58:05] may see all day and see what you are
[58:08] instructing us to do and Lord we're not
[58:10] here to uh bring conflict of interest
[58:14] but we want to be able to keep the
[58:15] people focused on the coming of the Lord
[58:18] that's what we've been called for that's
[58:20] what we we we we're preparing for and
[58:24] and and that's where we want to remain
[58:26] because the hour is so late help us now
[58:29] give us a greater revelation of yourself
[58:32] in us that we may be faithful to you
[58:34] Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[58:39] amen thank you for coming
[59:09] everything
