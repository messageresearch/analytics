[56:52] to abraham contributing
[56:56] he made to
[56:57] a covenant of grace
[57:03] you know in other words that covenant
[57:04] that god made with abraham had no
[57:06] conditions
[57:09] unconditionally because remember if you
[57:11] go back to the garden of eden
[57:14] you know when god was giving you know
[57:16] conditions where god was giving you know
[57:18] promises to adam and eve
[57:22] especially
[57:24] those promises had conditions see
[57:26] promise
[57:27] you know you remember god told him that
[57:29] you will not eat you know from this tree
[57:31] if i pray
[57:32] i don't have the power to sit down and
[57:34] the day you will eat from this straight
[57:36] that's the day that you will die
[57:53] that this covenant with me and abraham
[57:57] you know it doesn't depends on your
[57:59] failures
[58:01] you know it doesn't depends on your
[58:03] strength send the pope to the false or
[58:05] it doesn't depend on your work santi
[58:08] you know
[58:08] it's a grace that i swear by myself
[58:11] citrine glass because
[58:12] you know that i have already done it
[58:16] amen and and adam and eve yeah i don't
[58:19] want to add you know we'll see that from
[58:20] the bible that they didn't keep the
[58:21] promise
[58:24] god you know god gave his grace for them
[58:27] that you know
[58:28] in other words that the grace of god was
[58:30] projected
[58:34] god told them that the very same day
[58:35] that you will eat from this tree that's
[58:37] the day that you will die
[58:41] you know it happened that one day that
[58:43] day came and eve you know ate from the
[58:45] tree
[58:46] i have happy mother's day
[58:48] and she
[58:59] instead of keeping his promise
[59:17] even though the blessings of god were
[59:19] not fully given to them
[59:26] because they sin
[59:28] you know but nevertheless god didn't
[59:30] care of them made you in your life you
[59:32] know god gave them grace
[59:34] you know god showed them their his mercy
[59:37] and then you know after abraham
[59:40] you know years went by
[59:43] some pastors you know you have the the
[59:44] birth of isaac you know jacob and all
[59:46] the the 12 tribes
[59:52] and then around one time you know moses
[59:54] came emojis
[59:56] you know and then when moses came if you
[59:58] read in exodus chapter 19.
[1:00:01] you will see that that was the day where
[1:00:03] the chin of israel rejected the grace of
[1:00:05] god
[1:00:09] amen they rejected god's grace
[1:00:12] you know they
[1:00:19] because it was by god's grace that those
[1:00:21] people came out of he came out of egypt
[1:00:25] israel

[1:00:28] provided to them
[1:00:32] amen it was by god's grace that they
[1:00:33] were fair
[1:00:36] he was by the grace of god that they had
[1:00:38] you know the head healing of their
[1:00:39] bodies
[1:00:42] you know it was by the grace of god that
[1:00:43] they could walk and not wash their
[1:00:44] clothes
[1:00:45] like like glass to jerk you prove him

[1:00:48] grace that they could walk and not fear
[1:00:50] and not be tired
[1:00:54] but arriving at exodus 19.
[1:00:58] those people say you know they wanted to
[1:01:01] be as other as other people
[1:01:05] you know they wanted to be as the
[1:01:06] philistines and other other other other
[1:01:08] people if you really
[1:01:10] calmly you know
[1:01:11] they wanted to have the law instead of
[1:01:13] grace
[1:01:17] the request of the law
[1:01:20] and you remember that moses went to the
[1:01:22] mountain for 40 years
[1:01:27] if you read from exodus 19 to exodus 30
[1:01:30] i'm pretty sure 32 you will see it
[1:01:32] civilization
[1:01:36] it meant moses you know but went to the
[1:01:38] mountains and four for 40 years
[1:01:42] and if you see the number 40.
[1:01:46] number 40 means judgment you know
[1:01:47] because
[1:01:49] or temptation oh savage
[1:02:05] you know he told them that 40 in 40 days
[1:02:07] and 40 days that god will overthrow the
[1:02:10] the the the see
[1:02:16] uh you know in numbers 14 33 34
[1:02:23] amen god cursed the children of israel
[1:02:25] telling them that you will wander in the
[1:02:27] desert for 40 years
[1:02:47] 40 days
[1:02:51] and then after that no i had to wait for
[1:02:53] 40 days in the inside before before
[1:02:55] going out hey you know what i know i
[1:02:58] don't count you i want to shorten you
[1:03:00] know that
[1:03:08] amen because god the the number of god
[1:03:11] or the mathematics of god doesn't lie
[1:03:13] pastorally mathematic
[1:03:16] amen those people requested those people
[1:03:18] requested law said
[1:03:22] what and when moses went up in the
[1:03:24] mountains
[1:03:26] those people when they stayed they
[1:03:28] created to themselves an image of god
[1:03:35] and they started to worship that image
[1:03:39] and when moses came
[1:03:41] and the bible said that 3 thousand
[1:03:43] people were dead
[1:03:45] in person
[1:03:46] amen that was lo
[1:03:48] but if you come back to the new
[1:03:50] testament
[1:03:52] you will see that in chapter two why
[1:03:55] don't act
[1:03:57] amen jesus spent with the disciple for
[1:03:59] 40 days with the disciples
[1:04:03] and then he promised them to wait until
[1:04:06] you know until that spirit from that
[1:04:07] power from one heart will come back
[1:04:13] amen and the bible says that they waited
[1:04:14] for another 10 10 more days
[1:04:20] which makes it 50
[1:04:22] keep faith the totality 50
[1:04:31] amen and because that god couldn't judge
[1:04:34] them
[1:04:36] or in other words god couldn't do that
[1:04:37] 40 days alone
[1:04:41] because it will be against it will be
[1:04:43] against the world
[1:04:46] you know that's why he had to wait for
[1:04:47] that why they had to wait for another 10
[1:04:49] days
[1:04:52] to
[1:05:08] the bible said that after the first
[1:05:09] sermon of peter 3 000 people were saved
[1:05:16] but back in exodus
[1:05:19] after god gave the table of laws to
[1:05:21] moses
[1:05:24] three thousand people were dead twenty
[1:05:26] percent
[1:05:27] but in igbo in acts but made all these
[1:05:30] believers you know when god wrote those
[1:05:32] table of
[1:05:33] of of those into the heart of congress
[1:05:39] amen that's saved for uh 3 000 people
[1:05:43] you know not included the 120 that
[1:05:45] wasn't who were in the upper room so
[1:05:48] someone said uh
[1:06:07] in other words that without law we would
[1:06:10] know that stealing was bad
[1:06:15] without the law we will not know that
[1:06:17] lying is bad
[1:06:22] you know without the law we would not
[1:06:23] know that killing your brother is bad
[1:06:29] so low became to magnify those scenes
[1:06:33] amplification
[1:06:35] came to to put in our conscience that
[1:06:37] doing that the stealing is wrong
[1:06:43] but allah could not get us from those
[1:06:45] law couldn't bring us
[1:06:47] pardons
[1:06:50] couldn't bring us forgiveness
[1:06:53] you know that's why jesus had to die
[1:06:57] you know to bring that grace to man
[1:07:00] you know to offer the grace to man
[1:07:04] the prophet says in uh in the the book
[1:07:07] of law or grace the message little grace
[1:07:55] but then when law came in mcconnell
[1:07:58] he made the man realize he can't steer
[1:08:01] he can't lie honduran
[1:08:04] realized
[1:08:06] and he can't commit adultery
[1:08:11] and all of the commandments that are
[1:08:13] just magnified a truly common monster
[1:08:16] so
[1:08:17] an amplitude but yet that law didn't
[1:08:20] take away sin
[1:08:22] luanna
[1:08:36] you know to tell
[1:08:51] that
[1:08:52] the law required a blood for for the
[1:08:54] cleansing of sin
[1:09:00] you know that's why you will see that
[1:09:01] from the garden of eden
[1:09:04] you know to the death of jesus
[1:09:06] jesus
[1:09:07] jesus you know for forgiveness of sin
[1:09:09] the word giving the blood the blood has
[1:09:11] to be shed
[1:09:16] you know they had to kill a lamb for it
[1:09:25] you know in the old testament people
[1:09:26] were giving uh sacrifices and offerings
[1:09:31] sacrifice but you would notice that
[1:09:32] those blood
[1:10:15] would do again the same scene and then
[1:10:16] go
[1:10:18] home
[1:10:19] you know the the blood of animals
[1:10:21] couldn't get that person couldn't get
[1:10:23] the desire of seeing out of the place
[1:10:42] prophet explained it second prophetic it
[1:10:45] says that the soul of a man before being
[1:10:47] saved
[1:10:51] there's a snake inside of him
[1:10:54] and the more he's reading the the more
[1:10:56] he's reading the word and praying god
[1:11:01] you know the more is being justified the
[1:11:03] priesthood person is justified you know
[1:11:06] that snake is being killed
[1:11:11] and when the snake is dead it comes to
[1:11:13] sea
[1:11:14] you know that means that you know
[1:11:15] something else can replace him
[1:11:19] you know it can be another snake
[1:11:22] or another animal
[1:11:26] that person will have to go to to
[1:11:28] receive the holy spirit
[1:11:32] you know to make sure that that snake is
[1:11:34] completely completely dead and the dove
[1:11:36] is now the dove took place
[1:12:02] but the desire of the sins will not be
[1:12:05] will not be taken away

[1:38:12] god did it you know
[1:38:14] you know he's not compared to the
[1:38:16] blessing that they received

[1:38:22] commandments
[1:38:24] you know i'm gonna give you an example
[1:38:26] an example you know it's like in the
[1:38:27] family say call me don't you know you
[1:38:29] have a family you have parents and and
[1:38:31] children
[1:38:33] the dad tells he tells his wife
[1:38:38] you know as long as you're being a good
[1:38:39] wife to me
[1:38:42] you know
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:53] as long as you're being respectful
[1:38:56] you know as long as you
[1:38:59] you know i would wake up every morning
[1:39:01] and go to work
[1:39:02] today
[1:39:03] you know to give you something to eat
[1:39:06] and then if the wife is
[1:39:09] all the children two days on phone you
[1:39:11] know they don't obey or they don't do
[1:39:14] they don't do uh uh uh as the promise to
[1:39:16] the to the dead see this
[1:39:19] the fourth part of power
[1:39:21] you know you will see that the grace of
[1:39:23] god will be required so that they are
[1:39:25] there and keep his communications
[1:39:35] so that he can stand up wake up every
[1:39:37] morning
[1:39:46] you know even though even though they're
[1:39:47] not keeping his commandments they're not
[1:39:49] keeping their promises
[1:39:52] that's exactly the same thing that
[1:39:53] happened with them
[1:39:55] amen god gave his word
[1:39:58] god gave his commandments
[1:40:01] that we're supposed to follow can you
[1:40:03] pose history but we didn't do it
[1:40:06] but nevertheless he provided his grace
[1:40:08] to us
[1:40:10] you know he went he laid party he died
[1:40:13] on the cross
[1:40:14] like what did to give us afford the

[1:40:23] man like what you know so that we can be
[1:40:25] forgiven poconos

[1:40:29] not supposed to you know to step out
[1:40:31] we're not supposed to uh throw those
[1:40:33] sacrifices away in
[1:40:37] because the bible says in john chapter
[1:40:40] chapter 3 verse 16. that's crazy like
[1:40:42] bieber d don't don't
[1:40:44] john chapter 3 verse 16 is it for me

[1:40:48] says
[1:40:52] john chapter 3 verse 16 the bible says
[1:40:54] so jean-claude says
[1:40:59] that
[1:41:00] okay
[1:41:00] for god so loved the word and the gospel
[1:41:03] of the world and
[1:41:05] that he gave his only begotten son

[1:42:04] that for god sent now his son into the
[1:42:06] world to condemn the world
[1:42:12] but the world through him might be saved
[1:42:18] he that believeth on him
[1:42:21] is not condemned
[1:42:24] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:42:27] is condemned already
[1:42:30] because he has not believed in the name
[1:42:33] of the only begotten son
[1:42:37] and this is the condemnation
[1:43:09] and his son died on the cross
[1:43:12] a man his son died on the cross
[1:43:13] sufficient
[1:43:15] and the death on the cross
[1:43:18] you know this is now the opium

[1:46:54] husband
[1:46:58] an impure wife coming from imperial you
[1:47:01] might be the violet sinner of sinners
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:16] or in other words if you pass that stage
[1:47:18] of redemption
[1:47:19] is
[1:47:36] if you just accept it she will accept it
[1:47:38] adam had to be willing to accept it i
[1:47:40] don't the way the way uh
[1:47:43] i accept this
[1:47:44] so do you
[1:47:45] ever fail you know if you accept it she
[1:47:48] will accept it you know whatever your

[1:48:00] you just have to accept it with a visual
[1:48:03] acceptance you know the grace of god is
[1:48:04] so powerful like has to do a type we saw
[1:48:06] you know if you read the story of
[1:48:08] redemption
[1:48:11] you will see that the grace of god is
[1:48:12] any that has to do cause the family
[1:48:15] to backslide affection for
[1:48:21] you know who was serving a peg who was
[1:48:23] serving you know out of god
[1:48:26] understood the the the cell there's the
[1:48:28] salvia man he calls naomi and his family
[1:48:31] to backslash
[1:48:35] amen to go get the lost soul

[1:49:49] accept the judgment of god
