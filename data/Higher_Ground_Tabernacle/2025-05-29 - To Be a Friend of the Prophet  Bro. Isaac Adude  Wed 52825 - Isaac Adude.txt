[Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. We're so happy to be here this evening. Amen. We praise the Lord for his grace and his mercy. Amen. To keep us alive till today. It's a grace of God. Amen. So we thank him for it. Amen. Without taking too much time, let's turn our Bibles to Luke chapter 10. We'll read the verse 16. Luke 10 verse 16. Amen. The Bible says that he that heareth you heareth me, and he that he that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. Amen. Let's turn again to Luke chapter 19. Luke, we read the verse 5 to verse 9. Amen. Luke chapter 19 verse 5 to verse 9. Amen. The Bible says here, "And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said unto him, Zakius, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at thy house." And And he made haste and he came down and received him joyfully. [Music] Amen. Uh if we can jump verse 9 the Bible says here and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Amen. Uh let's bow our head. Father God, we thank you Lord for your grace. Lord, we thank you for your mercy. Lord, we thank you, Father, for everything that you have done for us, Lord. Lord, we pray, Father God, that you come, oh Lord, and you explain this word to Amen. And he that despiseth you despiseth me. And he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. Amen. So that's why brother Brandham is saying that if you receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, you receive the righteous man's reward. Is that right? And if they want to know what a prophet's reward is, amen, is to be a friend of the prophets. That's a reward. He is your friend. like the Shomite woman. Amen. He might come in handy sometimes. Amen. He might come in handy sometimes. Amen. To be a friend of the prophet. Amen. So this doesn't mean that you have to worship. Amen. Or start comparing that prophet with Jesus. Or you have to worship that righteous man. Amen. or to try to compare him with Jesus Christ. Amen. But he said that you have to receive him in equality. Amen. Of what God has sent him to be. Amen. So here in the spoken word, the prophet says that this is the law of God. Amen. He says that I don't know. He said that I don't know whether to say this or not. This is the law of God. God's law is to receive a vindicated servant. Amen. That is the law of God. Amen. And his law is to receive a vindicated servant. Amen. A vindicated servant. Amen. If you read if you read uh I believe the message the token. Amen. When when brother Brandham was explaining why Moses was a vindicated servant. Amen. He says that a vindicated servant. Amen. Has a message from God. Amen. And has the signs from God. Amen. And he is proven by the pillar of fire. Amen. That is a vindicated servant. Amen. So here I continue. He says that let's just prove that a minute. I want to take one of the scriptures here. John 13:20. Amen. And John 13:20 says that verily verily I say unto you that he that receives whosoever I send receives me. And he and he that receives whosoever I send receives me. And he that receives me receives him that sent me. Amen. But when you receive the person that God sent, Amen. You're not just you're not receiving the person that's the human flesh. So the the person that is let's say for example brother Brandham. Amen. By by you receiving God himself. Amen. Because he is sent by God. Amen. And if you receive God's servant Amen. That might be your friend, your brother. Amen. You don't receive just your brother. Amen. But you receive God who has sent that person. Amen. And when you receive that person, the prophet says that you receive the reward of that person. Amen. So now let's see what is the reward of the person that is sent by God. Amen. So let's turn to Matthew 10 11 to 14. Amen. Matthew chapter 10 11-14 or we can we can start with verse uh yeah verse 11. The Bible says that and into uh uh and into whatsoever city and town you shall enter. Inquire who in it uh uh who in it is worthy and there abide till you go then. And when you come into an house, salute it. And if the house be worthy, in other words, if that house receives you, let your peace come upon it. But if he be not worthy, let your peace return to you. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words when you depart out of thy house or city. Shake off the dust of your feet. Cuz verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah. Amen. In the day of in the day of judgment than for that city. Amen. Here is Jesus sending his disciples. Amen. To go to knock at every doors. Amen. And when they come to a door to a house, amen, they have to greet. They have to say to say their greetings. Amen. And if they are received, Amen. Jesus ordained them to let their peace with them. Amen. In other words, to bless their house. Amen. But if they did not receive them, they shut the door. Jesus told them to go with their blessings. Amen. That's why it is very important to receive the sons and daughters of God to your house. Amen. That's why fellowship is very important. Amen. When you open your doors to God's children, Amen. In other words, you are inviting blessings to come to your house. Amen. Because when you receive the person that God has sent, Amen, you receive the reward. Amen. Which is to become a friend of that person. Amen. And when you are a friend of of someone, amen, you wouldn't want to see your friend suffer. Amen. You will do everything that you can do to help that friend. Amen. James chapter 2 verse 25. Amen. You here it talks about Rahab. Amen. Rahab opened her doors to the the two spies. Amen. And because she opened her doors, Amen. her family were saved. Amen. Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way. Amen. She opened her doors. Amen. And if you read if you read I believe uh the book of Joshua, Amen, you will see that those servants those those servants or messengers they told Rahab that because you have helped us. Amen. Because you have saved our lives. Amen. Now we give you a sign. Amen. That you have to portray. Amen. And then invite all your family members. Amen. Invite everyone. Amen. And as long as there will be in that house, Amen. they will be saved. Amen. As long as they will be in that house. Amen. Because that house has received the messengers. Amen. Because that house has received the servants of God. Amen. The same thing happened to Lot. Amen. When Lot received the two angels, Amen. The two angels told Lot, Amen, to go call the his entire family. Amen. Those who will be willing to follow him. Amen. They will be saved. Amen. Those who will be willing to follow him and to get to the house. Amen. Will be saved. Amen. There is always a reward when you receive. Amen. The word of God when you receive the the servant of God. Amen. Revelation 3:20, the Bible says that behold I stand at the door and knock. Amen. And if you hear my voice and open the door, Amen. The reward is I will come into you. Amen. and I will s with you and you will s with me. Why? If you open your doors, Amen. If you open the doors and and and welcome Christ. Amen. He will come into you with you have a family. Amen. And we all know that everywhere that the presence of the Lord is great things happen. Amen. So if you invite Jesus, Amen, great things will happen to you. Amen. John 15:14-15. Amen. Here the Bible says here, "Greater love has no man than this, that a man laid down his life for his friends. Amen. Ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. Amen. Henceforth I call you not servant. For the servant knoweth not what his lord does. But I have called you friends. For all things that I have heard of my father have made known unto you. Amen. That is the benefits of becoming a friend of Jesus. Amen. Is to receive the revelation of the word. Amen. He's to know him in his entirety. Amen. He's to become his friend. Amen. I no longer call you servant. Amen. because you do what I have commanded you to do. Amen. And a servant doesn't know what his master does. But I have called you friend. Amen. Because I have made known to you everything. Amen. Like Abraham when he receives the three uh when he receive uh uh uh uh uh the the son of God and the and then the two angels. Amen. Amen. They left the blessings. Amen. They blessed him. Amen. At the end of the of the day when when they were about to leave. Amen. God said, "Shall I hide to Abraham what I'm about to do?" Amen. Because Abraham was a friend of God. Amen. Because Abraham received God. Amen. He became a friend of God. Amen. And God made him know what he was about to do in Sodom and Gomorrah. And because God made him know about that, he was able to plead for his brother Lot. Amen. Why? Because he opened his door to the servants of God. Amen. He opened his door to God. Amen. To to the word. Amen. When you say that, well, brother Isaac, Amen. How uh how are we how are we going to do this? Because brother Brennham was was dead I don't know how many years. Amen. So what do you mean by being a friend of the prophet? How am I going to invite him to my house? Amen. So here's a a quote for you here. Amen. The prophet says in the midst of the spiritual food in due season, Amen. Amen. Paragraph 66 to 68. Paragraph. He says that we find out that when a man comes sent from God or then of God with the dasa the Lord the message and the messenger are one and the same. Amen. In other words to receive the prophet. Amen. Is to receive his message. Amen. Because him, the messenger and the message are one. Amen. Because he is sent to rep to rep to represent Das the Lord. Amen. Word by word. So he and his message is the same. Amen. A denominational man under denominational opaces. [Music] He and the church is is the one. He's one. A theologian under theology made by made by some denomination. He and his message are one. Amen. Church of theology. A theology and its correctness. Amen. Then when a man comes with ths Lord, he and the message is one. And when Elijah come with Dasth the Lord, he and his message became one just as Jesus when he come he was the word St. John chapter one. So the word of God and the messenger of the age was the selfsame thing all the time. Amen. Amen. The word of God and the messenger of the age was the self same thing. Amen. So when you receive this message, you receive the reward of this message. Amen. And you received Christ. Amen. Because it's Christ who's sending the messenger. Amen. It's the message of Christ. Amen. The reason is today. Amen. The reason why you have so many confusions. Amen. You see many people they believe in the prophet. Amen. And they don't believe in the message. Amen. That's why there are so many confusions. Amen. But if you believe the message, Amen. You will see that the message points you to Christ. Amen. You will not see any. You won't have to compare comparing. Amen. compar comparing you know Christ to brother. Amen. So what is the reward of this message? What is the reward of receiving the prophet? Amen. The prophet says here is in the message leadership leadership paragraph 123 it says that that's why this the church age The church age that we live in, there is no church, no Methodist, Methodist, Baptist, Baptist, Pentecostal, or anything else can ever put this church into the bride. Amen. Amen. It will have to be the answering of Malachi 4. Amen. for God to send a prophet to be revealed to because that's the only way. Amen. The only way to be a bride. Amen. You have to receive. Amen. The answering of Malachi chapter 4. Amen. The prophet said that because that is the only way. Amen. It's not. There is no church, no Methodist, no Baptist, no Pentecostals or anything else that can put this church into the bride. Amen. For this church to be a bride or to become a bride, Amen. It will have to be the answering of Malachi 4. Amen. In other words, they will have to receive. Amen. Malachi 4 God to for God to send a prophet to be revealed to you because that is the only way. Our churches denominates and throw the thing into a mess and a huddle just like they've always been and God always sends the prophet. Amen. So the Bible tells us here that the spirit of Elijah, the spirit of Elijah will come five times. Amen. The first time was with Elijah himself. The second time was with Elisha. The third time with with uh was with John the Baptist. John the Baptist. Amen. The fifth time is uh Malachi 4, which is brother. Amen. And then uh u um uh the the and and then what did I say? The first time was with Elijah. The second time was with Elijah. The third time with John the Baptist Baptist. The fourth time was with brother Brandham. And the fifth time will be with the Elijah coming with Moses. Amen. And if you read the Bible, Amen. You will see that everyone that received those people under that spirit, Amen. received some type of recomp some type of reward. Amen. Every time that people have welcomed, Amen. those people into their houses, Amen. those houses were blessed. Amen. Because the Bible never lies. Amen. God said that if you receive my servant, Amen, you have received me. Amen. So if we read First Kings 17:8-6, Amen. I'm reading this. Amen. So that you know that it's not coming from me but it's from the Bible. Amen. So first Kings chapter uh uh chapter 17 verse 8-6. Amen. Here this is uh uh the first time that happened. Amen. The Bible says, "And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, "Arise, get to Zarapath, which belongth to Ziden, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a wider woman there to sustain thee." Amen. I I love the word. I love the way God does. Amen. He said that I have commanded a weed or woman to sustain thee. Amen. It's Amen. He has Amen. It's in other words. Amen. That woman, Amen. was already under the inspiration of God. Amen. When when Elijah was coming, Amen. That woman was already God knew that that was supposed to happen because it's him. Amen. Because it's him who have commanded that woman to take care of his prophets. Amen. And God decided to choose just the most poor like the the woman who didn't have anything to take care of his prophets. Amen. So verse 10, the Bible says, "So he arose and went to Zarapath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks. And he called to her, said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink. And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her and said, "Bring me, I pray, thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand." And she said, "As the Lord thy God leaveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in the barrel, and a little oil in a cruise. And behold, I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die. And now and Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and do as I as thou has said, but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee, and for thy son." Amen. How was it going to happen? Amen. This woman just told Elijah that I have the last meal that I'm about to make for my son and I. We eat it and then we die. So now Elijah here is telling the same woman that go do what you said. But before you do it, make one for me first. Then you'll go make for you and your son. Amen. For thus sayith the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of mid shall not waste. crews of oil fail until verse 14 until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she and he and her house did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Elijah. Amen. Because she received a servant of God. Amen. Because she received the word of God. Amen. Elijah said that thou sayest the Lord. Amen. When the prophet said that when a prophet says thou sayest the Lord, Amen. It's like Jesus Christ himself talking. Amen. Because that word will never fail. Amen. He says that that's the reason why you didn't see Jesus saying thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Because he was himself talking. Amen. And when a prophet says thus sayeth the Lord, Amen. The prophet says that he sees a vision. Amen. of how God has done that thing. Amen. So that's why he can come with all confidence. Amen. And says the Lord. Amen. And when a daith the Lord has been spoken that word will never come void but will fulfill the reason why it was. Amen. And she received a prophet. Amen. And she became a friend of a prophet. Amen. And the reward of becoming a friend of a prophet. Amen. Was her blessing, her salvation. Amen. She was about to die. Amen. But because she received a prophet and his message, she received the salvation of her life. Amen. The barrel of meal were wasted not neither the cru of of of of oil fail. Amen. It became like the experience of Jesus with the five bread and the the three fishes. Amen. A small basket. Amen. But because of the blessing of the Lord, it must keep on refilling itself. She did not have a big oil, a big jar of oil. But just that little bit of that small bottle that she had, every time she was pouring it down, that bottle was auto refilling itself. Amen. The same thing with Jesus after blessing the breads and the fish. Amen. Every time that people were taking it, that basket was auto refilling itself. Amen. Because she had received a prophet. Amen. She became a friend of a prophet. Amen. And she received the reward. Amen. Of being a friend of the prophet. Amen. And we if we if you continue in verse uh 17 to 24, we're not going to read it. Amen. You will see that when her son passed away. Amen. Because she received the prophet. Amen. Because she welcomed a prophet. Amen. That same prophet. Amen. Was able to bring resurrection to her house. Amen. Giving salvation to the son. Amen. Because she received a prophet. in his quality of a prophet. Amen. If you turn to uh uh uh uh second Kings. Amen. Chapter 4 verse 22 to uh to 7. Amen. So now we're with Elijah. Amen. Elisha received a double portion of Elijah. Amen. Which means that everything that Elijah accomplished. Amen. Elisha had to do it twice. Amen. So Elijah, amen, it was this woman. Amen. This widow, amen, she received him. Amen. And her house was blessed. Her son was resurrected. Amen. So if you turn to second Kings 47. Amen. If we start from the beginning verse one. Amen. The Bible says that now there cried a certain woman and of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, "Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Lord, and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. Amen. His her husband was a servant of the prophet. Amen. Her husband was fearing the Lord. Amen. So in other words that in their house they welcomed the message. Amen. So and Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me, why has thou in the house? And she said, "Then handmade has not anything in the house, save a pot of oil, just a little bit of oil." Then he said, "Go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors." Amen. Even empty vessels, and borrow not a few. Amen. And when thou art coming, thou shalt shut the door upon thee, upon thy sons, and shall pour into all those vessels. And thou shalt set aside that which is full. Amen. Because they receive the message. Amen. Because their family, their family, Amen. received the servants of God. Amen. They received the fear of the Lord. Amen. They received the servant of God and his message. Amen. When they were in trouble. Amen. Her her two sons were lost. Amen. Her two sons were about to be taken as prisoners to pay her debt. Amen. Salvation came to her house. Notice Elijah Elisha asked her, "But what do you have in your house?" Amen. Because God to bless you, God will use what you have. Amen. That God will use what you have. Amen. That's why he asked Moses, "Moses, what do you have in your hands?" Amen. And God will use that. So don't be afraid even if it's a little thing. Because little is much as long as God is in it. Amen. So the widow woman only had a little bit of oil. Amen. By that little bit of oil was able to last until the rain until the rain came. Amen. And this woman also had just a pot of oil. Amen. But because they were friends of the prophet Amen. They also receive the reward of the prophet. Amen. And when the prophet told her to go borrow all the empty vessels. Amen. And he specifically told her not to borrow a few. Amen. That's the reward. Amen. That's the reward. That's why the prophet said that it will come in handy sometimes. Amen. In your time of need. Amen. Because you have received the message. Amen. It will come in handy sometime. Amen. Those two women they were in troubles. Amen. Their lives were ended. Amen. But because they were friends of the prophets. Amen. That friendship came in handy. Amen. And that saved their house. Amen. So she bought she she went and she borrowed all the empty vessels that she could find. Amen. And she went and she sold. She got money and she paid up she paid out her debt. Amen. And the remaining of money became her source of business. Amen. To take care of her sons because she received a prophet. She received the message. Amen. And she received the reward of that prophet. Amen. If you continue verse 8 to verse 16. Amen. Here is another woman. Amen. The Bible says that and he fell on that on the day that Elijah passed to to Shanim where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread. Amen. In other words, she didn't give Elisha or the prophet no other options. Amen. The same way God told Elijah that I have orained a woman to sustain this. Amen. Which means that that woman did not have any other options but to do what God already planned. Amen. The same way that Jesus told Zakius that I must be to your house today. At your house today. Amen. So this woman constrained him to eat bread. So it was so it was that as often he passed by. Amen. He turned in he turned into hether to to eat bread. Amen. It was the house that Elisha now was going every day that she will pass by that he will pass by. Amen. It was a house that he will go always to eat bread. Amen. And if you read the remaining of the verse of the of the chapter. Amen. Because Elisha was going there every day. Amen. That woman decided to build a little chamber. Amen. For the prophets. Amen. And there he put a lamp. She placed the lamp. Amen. To allow the prophet to meditate the word. Amen. And because she did all of that. Amen. The prophet asked her asked her, "What do you want that I do for you?" Amen. The prophet go went and ask her servant go and and and ask her what what does she want? Amen. She said that I don't want anything. I'm good. I'm with my husband and all that. Amen. But because she received a prophet in his quality of a prophet. Amen. God was able to answer her unspoken need. Amen. The servants Gazi told uh told uh Elijah. Amen. If you read verse 14, Amen. He says that and and and very verily she has no child and her husband is old. Amen. Even though she said that she is in need of nothing. Amen. But because of her actions, Amen. God was able to give her what she didn't ask for. Amen. A son. Amen.
