[39:25] brother i'm sorry
[39:27] god is so good to us saint john 14
[39:31] 20. thank you sir
[39:35] we're going to just work with that one
[39:38] scripture for the moment
[39:49] everybody everybody's there trust
[39:53] matthew mark luke and john
[39:58] john 14
[40:01] and 20. i
[40:04] love the book of john
[40:08] all of the gospels are great but the
[40:10] book of john to me
[40:12] is it's just amazing
[40:16] because john starts at a place where
[40:19] none of the others
[40:20] do start john starts
[40:24] from the beginning or in the beginning
[40:28] or before the beginning
[40:31] however you want to place it but i just
[40:33] love john
[40:35] and john revelation of god was
[40:40] as far as i'm concerned perfect
[40:44] and understanding and he understood
[40:50] what god was going to do in this day
[40:54] i believe god gave him a great
[40:56] understanding
[40:57] saint john 14 20.
[41:04] amen can you imagine
[41:08] how he must have felt
[41:13] when he was able to
[41:16] be in a position nobody else could be in
[41:22] i got it correctly he laid in the bosom
[41:28] of jesus christ
[41:31] and tonight that's where i want to lay
[41:36] in his bosom saint john
[41:40] 14 20 at that day
[41:45] ye shall know that i am in the father
[41:48] and ye and me and i
[41:51] in you before i began to pray there was
[41:56] a sister
[41:56] is a sister by the name of kiki she's

[42:08] consider herself as a christian anyway
[42:11] she's suffering from cancer
[42:13] and they've tried the um
[42:17] different methods and they all failed
[42:20] and now they
[42:21] are trying the chemo
[42:24] she's quite weak i suggested that
[42:28] they play the tape victory day for her
[42:32] uh faith is a victory i'm sorry and um
[42:37] desperation so they're going to allow
[42:40] her or try to get her to listen to those
[42:42] tape and pray
[42:43] that god will quicken her with the faith
[42:46] that she needs to
[42:48] overcome with so let's pray that god
[42:51] will bless the message tonight
[42:54] father god we come before you
[42:57] and we thank you for your amazing grace
[43:01] we thank you for being so good to us
[43:05] words cannot express our gratitude
[43:08] father we just pray right now that you
[43:10] bless the word open our understanding
[43:14] we know father god is not in the
[43:17] loudness or the
[43:20] pronunciations of words or the
[43:23] drama that could be added to it
[43:27] that's nothing to do with you your word
[43:30] is simple plain and true
[43:32] and we pray that this word would quicken
[43:35] our souls
[43:36] we're depending on you lord to give us
[43:40] understanding and enlightenment and the
[43:42] things that we need to know
[43:44] and the things that we need to know to
[43:46] walk in
[43:48] bless us tonight as we glorify your name
[43:51] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[43:55] you may be seated i love god
[43:59] because he's such a god of variety
[44:04] you know he he's the kind of god that
[44:09] could love you in spite of all of your
[44:12] faults
[44:14] that's the kind of love i want to
[44:16] express
[44:19] tonight message would be
[44:23] working with the thought hungering to
[44:26] see more of him
[44:29] of course in my little attachment i said
[44:32] in the inner man
[44:36] because we are predestinated to
[44:41] come to a completion
[44:44] and i believe that i believe that we're
[44:46] the generation that is going to see
[44:49] the perfect man make us
[44:52] become the perfect man
[44:56] we are those who are of abraham's seed
[45:01] and the bible tells us that abraham
[45:03] staggered
[45:04] not and oftentimes we read that we
[45:07] really don't see
[45:08] what really being said but
[45:12] i don't know whether you've ever walked
[45:15] and something just caused you to trip
[45:17] and you're staggered
[45:18] momentarily but the bible says that
[45:22] there was nothing that tripped
[45:25] abraham or caused him to stagger
[45:29] no matter what came his way abraham
[45:32] believed god
[45:33] remember i said in the messages before
[45:36] and prior
[45:37] this message mean you no good if you
[45:40] really don't believe it
[45:42] and this belief is a action word
[45:46] hearing acting believing
[45:50] you know it's something that goes into
[45:52] effect
[45:53] once it's quickened to you according to
[45:57] romans 4
[45:58] 20-25 the bible says he staggered not at
[46:02] the promise of god
[46:04] through unbelief but was strong in
[46:08] faith giving glory to god
[46:12] that means when you don't even see
[46:13] evidence of your blessing
[46:16] you're able to glorify god
[46:19] this is the part that i really love
[46:21] because it used the word
[46:24] fully and being fully persuaded
[46:29] that means there was no room for nothing
[46:31] else
[46:33] his faith had captured the entire
[46:36] environment
[46:40] what he had promised he was able to
[46:43] perform remember
[46:45] the bible says to those who come to god
[46:47] must first believe that he
[46:49] is god you know what i mean now and we
[46:52] say is god is more than just
[46:54] something to worship but we're talking
[46:57] about god who created all things
[47:00] these little these little finite minds
[47:02] can't comprehend it but
[47:04] the only thing we can do is have faith
[47:06] and believe it
[47:09] that means he's omnipotent all power
[47:12] omniscient
[47:13] knows all things is that right
[47:15] omnipresent because he's everywhere
[47:18] by his full knowledge and therefore
[47:21] he well it was imputed to him
[47:25] for righteousness you understand that
[47:29] the scripture uh jesus was asked
[47:32] you know what must we do
[47:36] basically to inherit eternal life
[47:39] and he said believe on him whom i have
[47:42] sent
[47:44] that's powerful because if you think
[47:47] about it you're thinking about
[47:49] that jesus is basically saying believe
[47:51] on me but
[47:52] it wasn't just that it mean to believe
[47:56] on whom the man whom i've sent that he's
[47:59] carrying the word of god
[48:01] and you've got to believe on him and and
[48:04] he he
[48:04] can i say it like this he duped the
[48:07] devil in this last day
[48:09] when he brought william branham on the
[48:11] scene
[48:12] and a lot of us don't even realize how
[48:15] important
[48:16] uh knowing who he is and who he was
[48:20] what it's going to mean for you down the
[48:23] road and perhaps the days are short and
[48:25] more shorter
[48:26] shorter than you think they are
[48:29] now in other words god would not impute
[48:32] sin to abraham
[48:34] instead of imputing sin
[48:39] i'm happy he imputed
[48:42] righteousness can you understand that
[48:46] can you understand he imputed
[48:48] righteousness
[48:50] and if you if you watch abraham's life
[48:53] he made
[48:54] a lot of mistakes but god
[48:57] imputed righteousness he deceived the
[49:01] king of egypt
[49:03] would have caused his death
[49:07] and in all of that he was so blessed
[49:11] when he left egypt he had more substance
[49:15] leaving egypt than he had going into
[49:19] think about it in this day
[49:22] amen that we're hungering for god is
[49:25] such a blessing
[49:27] i don't know about you but i want
[49:29] everything that the message is promised
[49:32] everything of god everything of god i
[49:34] don't have to be a great man
[49:35] i don't have to be some well-known
[49:37] person
[49:38] i just want to have him right
[49:42] in that way that the bible says i'm
[49:45] supposed to have
[49:48] now it was not written for his sake all
[49:51] alone
[49:52] that he it was it was imputed to him in
[49:55] other words this was not
[49:56] given just for abraham but remember
[49:59] brother talks about
[50:00] abraham's seed but for us also to whom
[50:03] it shall be imputed
[50:05] if we believe on him that raised up
[50:07] jesus our lord from the dead
[50:10] who has delivered who who was delivered
[50:14] for our offenses y'all understand me
[50:18] in the scripture the bible says he was
[50:20] delivered
[50:21] for our offenses
[50:24] in other words he paid your debt
[50:28] he paid your debt now
[50:31] there shouldn't be a sad christian
[50:35] anywhere in the world if they understand
[50:39] this
[50:43] listen i'm kind of glad you're quiet
[50:45] tonight
[50:47] because i'm actually in a shout mood
[50:50] so you're stabilizing me right now amen
[50:54] who was delivered for our offenses and
[50:58] was raised again
[51:00] for what our justification okay you know
[51:03] it's like okay i'm guilty i'm guilty on
[51:06] every charge every
[51:08] charge and here is a man who takes my
[51:10] place
[51:11] that's the scripture says he became our
[51:14] righteousness
[51:15] we became his righteousness he became
[51:17] our sin
[51:18] yonders oh my you see but like i said
[51:22] you got to believe this
[51:25] every man in this world if you're not
[51:28] believing the truth you're believing a
[51:30] lie
[51:33] right because remember the whole bible
[51:35] starts off with the truth
[51:37] and then satan brings in a lie and his
[51:40] whole civilization
[51:42] has been based on lies
[51:47] but for the man who believes the truth
[51:49] he comes to understand
[51:51] this is not the creature that god
[51:54] intended me to be
[51:57] something's on the inside of him that
[52:00] cries out for
[52:01] more you know you you see all of the
[52:04] crazy things they put out there and
[52:06] and everybody want to be a superstar and
[52:08] everybody want to have these uh
[52:10] super powers but nobody wants the super
[52:13] god
[52:14] who can produce the super power who
[52:16] could make you a superman
[52:19] you see they don't want that
[52:22] they want the lies of the enemy
[52:26] and therefore they have been given over
[52:27] to a strong delusion
[52:30] in the book of psalms 61 38 let me hurry
[52:32] up for that has been my shelter for me
[52:36] and a strong tower from the end of me
[52:39] i will abide in that tabernacle forever
[52:43] i will trust the comfort of that covet
[52:45] of thy wings
[52:47] oh i didn't even know what that was
[52:50] until the
[52:50] the seals were open and the angels with
[52:53] the swept back wings
[52:55] now what am i doing i'm trusting in that
[52:58] revelation
[53:00] i can rest in that amen because the lamb
[53:03] has
[53:03] opened the book he's loosed the seals
[53:06] and he's claimed
[53:08] his subjects and i'm so glad to be one
[53:11] of them
[53:12] ah for thou god has
[53:15] heard my vows thou has given me the
[53:18] heritage of those that fear thy name
[53:20] thou will prolong the king's life and
[53:23] his gears
[53:24] as many generations he shall abide
[53:26] before god forever
[53:28] oh prepare mercy and truth which may
[53:32] preserve
[53:32] me huh mercy and truth
[53:37] will preserve me because as long as i
[53:40] know mercy and i know truth
[53:42] i know there's grace hallelujah
[53:47] so will i sing praise unto thy name
[53:49] forever
[53:52] that i may daily
[53:55] perform my vows
[53:59] you understand me you say well what vows
[54:01] what vows
[54:02] we're talking about a marriage here
[54:05] we're not talking about just any kind of
[54:06] violence we're talking about the bride
[54:08] and the bride bridegroom
[54:12] i'll be faithful
[54:16] as faithful as i possibly can be
[54:20] right now let me move on
[54:23] i've been enjoying myself blessed is the
[54:26] man who
[54:28] thou chooses and causes to approach
[54:32] that's psalm 65 and 4 unto thee
[54:35] that he may dwell in thy courts
[54:38] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[54:42] of thy house
[54:44] even of thy holy temple
[54:48] you say oh i came to the lord yes if you
[54:51] did it's because god
[54:52] caused it
[54:55] god was moving in your life even when
[54:58] you didn't even realize he was moving
[55:01] at the end of the day it's going to
[55:03] always be god the lord jesus he says i
[55:06] am the alpha
[55:07] the omega the beginning and the end
[55:11] paul says he's the author of salvation
[55:16] that means he wrote the book you
[55:18] understand me so therefore
[55:20] you are in his book you are his
[55:23] uh hockey i said he wrote you in there
[55:29] he caused you he calls you we saw
[55:33] i thirst for god he causes you to thirst
[55:36] oh i'm desperate for god he causes you
[55:39] to be desperate
[55:40] how many of us wish we were desperate at
[55:43] times
[55:44] you can't do it you can get on your
[55:46] knees and and everything else and
[55:48] try your best but when god puts a
[55:51] desperation on you
[55:53] it's the saddest thing about that
[55:55] brother brethren said god really has
[55:57] he's got to do that because men are so
[55:59] slawful
[56:01] in their ways god has to put
[56:03] circumstances and conditions
[56:05] in our play in our in our pathway to
[56:08] bring us to a desperation
[56:10] i don't care how he does it i'm just so
[56:13] glad he's doing it
[56:15] cause me to be desperate right
[56:19] because you got to understand there is a
[56:21] quench there's a thirst quencher
[56:23] and that's who jesus is when you thirst
[56:26] for righteousness
[56:27] the bible said you shall be filled he's
[56:30] a thirst quencher
[56:31] if you want a deeper revelation he's a
[56:34] thirst quencher
[56:35] if you want to understand the seven
[56:37] seals he's a thirst quencher
[56:39] hallelujah whatever you desire of god he
[56:42] he knows how
[56:43] can i say it break the bread
[56:46] right because remember jesus christ was
[56:49] spiritually breaking the bread to the
[56:51] disciples
[56:51] on the way to to emmaus they didn't even
[56:54] know it
[56:55] he was breaking the bread and he started
[56:58] from the prophets
[56:59] and he brought it all the way up
[57:03] and then when he finally broke the
[57:04] natural bread the eyes were open
[57:08] can't nobody do me like jesus can't
[57:11] nobody give me that revelation
[57:13] nobody can quicken me it's just you know
[57:16] how can you say it
[57:17] there's something about this message as
[57:19] that song says
[57:20] that keeps holding me
[57:24] oh we've got to become more sensitive to
[57:29] the holy spirit that's our problem we're
[57:32] not
[57:33] as sensitive as we should be we're too
[57:35] calm minded
[57:36] right amen and uh we we need to ask god
[57:40] lord make me more
[57:41] sensitive to you that if i'm walking
[57:44] down the street and you pass by me
[57:46] make me know that's you if somebody is
[57:49] talking to me and then
[57:50] they don't even appear to be a a
[57:53] christian but you speak
[57:54] through them lips let me know it's you
[57:58] y'all do you believe god can do that
[58:01] absolutely if god can
[58:03] speak to balaam through a donkey he can
[58:06] you
[58:06] is that right it was one of the romans
[58:10] was it caesar a herot herod
[58:13] that literally said that one man was
[58:15] going to die
[58:18] to save them all uh
[58:21] and and and i think it was one of those
[58:23] backslidden priests but anyway
[58:26] it was sad and god used him to prophesy
[58:30] when he wasn't even a prophet
[58:35] what we understand you say well what is
[58:37] pressing what is pressing what is
[58:39] what is being sensitive sensitive to the
[58:41] very fact that
[58:42] you need more god
[58:46] so many people don't even know that
[58:49] um they think they're okay
[58:56] the pharisees and sadducees thought they
[58:58] were all right did y'all know that
[59:00] until john came
[59:04] the denominational system thought they
[59:06] were all right
[59:07] until the spirit of john came
[59:11] and he shook their world they hated him
[59:16] because he he literally exposed their
[59:19] nakedness and even though they thought
[59:22] they were clothed
[59:24] they were naked because the word of god
[59:27] said they would be in this day
[59:30] so they had to come to the knowledge
[59:32] that they were naked because the bible
[59:33] said they didn't know they were naked
[59:35] but when the word began to shine on them
[59:38] instead of clothing themselves
[59:41] they had preferred and had rather be
[59:43] naked
[59:44] than clothed but this message is a
[59:47] clothing
[59:49] it is the righteousness of god it is god
[59:52] amen clothing you with his his character
[59:57] hallelujah you see we didn't know and
[59:59] i'm still i'm still i'm
[1:00:01] reaching a higher plane now i'm still
[1:00:03] working with that that's in this
[1:00:05] what i'm working with now is in the
[1:00:06] theme of that because i want you to
[1:00:07] understand
[1:00:08] what i'm talking about is not going to
[1:00:10] just drop in your lap
[1:00:12] you've got to press your way into it and
[1:00:14] as brother branham said
[1:00:15] you got to climb up into god
[1:00:19] i like that it doesn't come easy
[1:00:24] you got to somehow separate you got to
[1:00:26] put yourself in a position where
[1:00:28] you and god and god alone and be honest
[1:00:31] you know
[1:00:31] this is how i've overcome so many things
[1:00:34] have
[1:00:34] in my life because what can you hide
[1:00:38] from god
[1:00:41] you can't hide anything from me and i'm
[1:00:43] telling you
[1:00:44] i've had to come first confess unto god
[1:00:46] some wicked stuff
[1:00:47] hello whoo don't you say that brother
[1:00:50] brooks
[1:00:52] i've had to you know things that i
[1:00:55] thought
[1:00:55] felt and at times desired
[1:01:01] and it was hard for me to say that to
[1:01:04] god
[1:01:05] even though i knew he knew you
[1:01:08] understand me
[1:01:08] but i understood the only way that i
[1:01:10] could ever be free
[1:01:12] was to make god know that these things
[1:01:15] that abide or
[1:01:16] or or attract me is those things i do
[1:01:20] not desire to have
[1:01:22] lord this is a fleshly man's desire this
[1:01:25] is the fleshly man's wants
[1:01:27] this is the fleshly man amen lusting
[1:01:30] this is the fleshly man amen desiring
[1:01:32] those things
[1:01:32] but i need more spirit i need more god
[1:01:36] i need more of you that's the only way i
[1:01:38] can overcome
[1:01:40] i can't overcome on myself no man can do
[1:01:43] it i'm gonna tell you
[1:01:44] you can you can you can be on a
[1:01:45] mountaintop you know in a cave
[1:01:48] acting like a monk
[1:01:51] and your sins will still be there
[1:01:55] why because you have an imagination
[1:01:59] and as long as your imagination is alive
[1:02:03] sin is alive what are you saying
[1:02:06] the bible says that man followed after
[1:02:09] the imagination of his heart and he
[1:02:12] became more wicked
[1:02:15] because your imagination will event
[1:02:19] invent excuse me we'll invent
[1:02:22] stuff a pleasure
[1:02:26] am i talking right may i have perhaps
[1:02:29] things you've never even dreamed about
[1:02:31] doing
[1:02:31] your imagination can bring it to a place
[1:02:35] of appeal
[1:02:37] appealing something that will appeal to
[1:02:39] you
[1:02:40] if it wasn't for the holy ghost the holy
[1:02:43] ghost is our bomber
[1:02:45] the holy ghost is the god that really
[1:02:47] stops it
[1:02:48] yes sir the holy ghost and says ah
[1:02:51] that's wrong
[1:02:52] [Laughter]
[1:02:55] i love it when we talk about pressing
[1:02:57] into and i'm going to tell you something
[1:03:00] right now you know just here's what god
[1:03:02] has done for me
[1:03:03] and in all the prayers that i did while
[1:03:05] i was in in uh
[1:03:07] uh arizona all of that was good but you
[1:03:09] know i learned one thing
[1:03:11] you can't quit
[1:03:14] not for a moment satan is always there
[1:03:18] right to fight you to bring everything
[1:03:22] down that you've
[1:03:23] established to take away all that you
[1:03:26] have
[1:03:26] you understand me and so it's always
[1:03:29] oppressing
[1:03:30] you understand me this kingdom is a
[1:03:32] kingdom of pressing
[1:03:33] it's not easy the bible said few be that
[1:03:36] find it
[1:03:38] only a few because so many are not
[1:03:41] willing to fight for it you got to fight
[1:03:45] and the thing about it i told a brother
[1:03:47] yesterday i must say i told him i said
[1:03:49] brother let me tell you something
[1:03:53] once a man surrender his will to god
[1:03:57] he has become totally victorious
[1:04:02] our greatest battle with surrender
[1:04:07] is our will we don't want to die
[1:04:13] we want to be in control y'all didn't
[1:04:16] know that
[1:04:17] man likes to be in control it's what
[1:04:20] satan placed in him he don't want god to
[1:04:23] control him
[1:04:24] but let me let me tell you something
[1:04:27] until you
[1:04:28] let god control you
[1:04:31] he can't transform this goat
[1:04:36] right he is trying to change you from a
[1:04:39] goat to a sheep
[1:04:41] because a sheep is one of the only
[1:04:43] animals i know
[1:04:44] that surrenders its will i mean even
[1:04:47] unto death
[1:04:48] i saw with my own eyes a sheep being
[1:04:51] slaughtered
[1:04:52] and he never fought back
[1:04:56] with my own eyes i was just amazed
[1:04:59] now the other sheep that was with him
[1:05:02] was afraid
[1:05:04] but they didn't scatter they huddled and
[1:05:07] they watched
[1:05:10] most of us when trials come like you're
[1:05:13] on your own man
[1:05:15] huh but when it comes to that it just it
[1:05:18] blew my mind i'm like oh my goodness
[1:05:20] and it just looked like the sheep was
[1:05:22] just when it came to the master
[1:05:24] cutting his throat and everything he was
[1:05:26] just faithful he wouldn't he wasn't
[1:05:28] acting like a goat kicking and carrying
[1:05:30] on
[1:05:31] anyway i thought about the lord i
[1:05:33] thought about the holy spirit
[1:05:34] when the holy spirit is one you know the
[1:05:36] bible says make your make your body a
[1:05:38] living sacrifice
[1:05:40] right don't kick against the holy spirit
[1:05:42] when god said don't do it don't do it
[1:05:44] don't fight back you know and that's
[1:05:47] what we do
[1:05:48] we fight back because we like i said
[1:05:50] we've got to move
[1:05:52] grace is good for us grace will always
[1:05:54] be with us
[1:05:56] grace is for us but we must move up
[1:05:58] higher
[1:06:00] to the fact that we are elected
[1:06:04] to be the bride of christ
[1:06:08] election will take you farther once you
[1:06:11] understand who you
[1:06:12] are you won't worry about grace because
[1:06:16] your your mindset is to do the king's
[1:06:20] will
[1:06:21] your mindset is to do what he wants you
[1:06:23] to do because you
[1:06:25] understand i am the bride of christ he's
[1:06:27] my head
[1:06:28] like i was trying to tell somebody the
[1:06:30] other day i said the headstone has come
[1:06:32] down
[1:06:33] right it's here to cap the bride
[1:06:37] it's here to bring uh her under his
[1:06:40] headship remember
[1:06:41] the body is the body but jesus christ is
[1:06:44] the head
[1:06:46] and so he's now let's say if you can
[1:06:49] see god in you in the way that you want
[1:06:51] to rule and reign
[1:06:52] let god rule and reign in your life
[1:06:56] right this is what i see this is the
[1:06:59] hour of intimacy
[1:07:01] we must come to this intimacy bro
[1:07:03] sisters
[1:07:05] we must i can't i can't tell you
[1:07:08] how important that is brother brown i
[1:07:11] mean the message
[1:07:12] um i was listening to it today listening
[1:07:15] to you know desperation
[1:07:17] he said that's what happened to the
[1:07:18] pentecostals they were
[1:07:20] they had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:24] but they didn't want to move on to
[1:07:25] adoption
[1:07:27] understand they had the baptism that was
[1:07:30] a real holy ghost
[1:07:32] but they didn't want to cross over he
[1:07:34] said that was the way it was esau
[1:07:36] esau had the birthright hello
[1:07:40] and he gave it up
[1:07:43] to jacob because jacob wanted it jacob
[1:07:46] was born a son
[1:07:48] jacob was born with a promise but jacob
[1:07:51] wanted to see the promised live
[1:07:53] that's the bride of jesus christ you've
[1:07:56] been born with a promise
[1:07:58] and you want to see the promise live
[1:08:01] let me tell you about this it's not
[1:08:04] going to be
[1:08:04] a whole lot of folks
[1:08:10] i'm sorry this is not a group effort
[1:08:14] it's not about us no it's about you
[1:08:18] you're the man you're the woman that has
[1:08:21] to defy
[1:08:23] satan's lies you've got to look at this
[1:08:26] thing and
[1:08:27] keep your eyes focused on the promise
[1:08:30] like abraham who staggered not
[1:08:33] no matter what satan put in his way
[1:08:35] y'all know what i'm trying to say
[1:08:37] how many times you faltered and satan
[1:08:40] say see
[1:08:41] you're just a hypocrite
[1:08:46] you don't have to raise your hand i
[1:08:47] raise mine
[1:08:49] it's true
[1:08:52] people i'm not here to look like a pope
[1:08:55] or some grand bishop
[1:08:57] i'm a man and both all of us are looking
[1:09:00] for the same thing
[1:09:02] more of him i'm not afraid to say
[1:09:07] who am i am and my faults what it is
[1:09:11] why you know if the bible says
[1:09:15] if you hide your sins you can't prosper
[1:09:18] huh there's no prospect satan will lie
[1:09:21] to you and make you feel like you're
[1:09:22] prospering
[1:09:23] they give you some blessings as oh
[1:09:24] you're getting along pretty good
[1:09:26] well esau prospered
[1:09:30] matter of fact he was rich by the time
[1:09:32] jacob got back
[1:09:34] but where is esau who was esau
[1:09:38] your prosperity does not determine who
[1:09:41] you are
[1:09:43] what about the rich young ruler who had
[1:09:45] all of this money and all these goods
[1:09:47] and here was paul lazarus who was the
[1:09:50] rich man
[1:09:52] you understand me so let's not let satan
[1:09:55] deceive us
[1:09:56] in this age of increase with good
[1:09:59] and have need of nothing
[1:10:02] and bible said those people were naked
[1:10:04] and didn't even know it
[1:10:07] hungering you understand what i'm saying
[1:10:10] if you're not hungry
[1:10:12] you need to ask god to give you the
[1:10:14] hunger coming from the message
[1:10:17] amen hearing recognizing and acting
[1:10:20] he said there's something in you
[1:10:23] hungering and moving like it was jacob
[1:10:26] see
[1:10:26] you're wrestling with the lord you walk
[1:10:29] different after that
[1:10:31] something is different than you you've
[1:10:33] changed
[1:10:34] see that's what i'm saying oh oh i spoke
[1:10:36] in tongues but have you changed
[1:10:38] i've shouted and i danced but have you
[1:10:40] changed i believe the message but have
[1:10:43] you changed
[1:10:44] it must bring a change
[1:10:47] the change must be there and it's not
[1:10:50] something that you
[1:10:51] can do on your own he brings to change
[1:10:54] but you
[1:10:54] wrestle with this message you said
[1:10:56] that's me
[1:10:57] i'm not going to give up on it until you
[1:11:00] bless me
[1:11:01] till i become the word of this hour
[1:11:05] i told you i feel like shouting i'm
[1:11:07] trying to hold on
[1:11:11] i don't know how y'all feeling but this
[1:11:12] is really good to me
[1:11:14] i don't care i could stand here and
[1:11:17] preach till
[1:11:18] what hairs i've got left fell out till
[1:11:21] my shoulders stooped down
[1:11:22] and i was 90 years old and you listen
[1:11:26] every day until god quickens that to you
[1:11:30] you're still in the same shape
[1:11:33] he's the quickener you know what he
[1:11:34] means bring it to life
[1:11:37] two days i've been studying and praying
[1:11:40] on this
[1:11:41] and i said lord should i say that to the
[1:11:43] to the church
[1:11:44] he said something says say it the hour's
[1:11:47] at hand
[1:11:48] say it i feel he's pulling me away
[1:11:51] pretty soon see
[1:11:52] no man can come to me said jesus except
[1:11:55] my father draws him first
[1:11:57] and oh i know you say you have god
[1:12:00] and abraham and to your father amen but
[1:12:03] i'll tell you this
[1:12:04] let me say it i know you say you got
[1:12:07] william branham
[1:12:08] as your father but i'll say to you that
[1:12:10] this
[1:12:11] you're right to your father but i tell
[1:12:13] you this
[1:12:14] he goes home and says your father is of
[1:12:16] the devil said jesus
[1:12:18] religious men priests and great men you
[1:12:21] are of the devil your father see notice
[1:12:24] the fruits of the spirit and that that's
[1:12:28] what people
[1:12:28] around this message think well because
[1:12:30] i'm nice
[1:12:31] and i'm nice to people that vindicates
[1:12:35] me
[1:12:37] but scientology can produce that
[1:12:40] mind over matter can produce that
[1:12:44] that's not what you want you want a life
[1:12:46] that's so given you don't even know
[1:12:47] you're doing things
[1:12:49] right oh jesus when when did we visit
[1:12:52] you in prison and when
[1:12:53] did we feed you and when did we clothe
[1:12:55] you
[1:12:56] see they were so in love with christ
[1:12:59] they were so
[1:13:00] enveloped in his love i mean they never
[1:13:02] paid attention to what they were doing
[1:13:05] they just did what he said they weren't
[1:13:08] mocking it down well there's another
[1:13:09] nugget for my treasures in heaven
[1:13:11] there's one for another piece of
[1:13:14] something
[1:13:15] no they didn't do that
[1:13:18] uh-uh so you say what do you mean
[1:13:22] listen let me go on now because what we
[1:13:25] must understand is what the devil is
[1:13:26] trying to keep you from
[1:13:28] and that is the resurrection this is the
[1:13:31] rapture age
[1:13:33] he's trying to keep you from being
[1:13:35] raptured
[1:13:36] y'all understand that this is what he's
[1:13:38] all about
[1:13:39] right because he knows even if you
[1:13:41] foolish virgin
[1:13:42] he can torment you for a little more
[1:13:45] another season
[1:13:46] but the raptured bride is a slap in his
[1:13:49] face
[1:13:51] wouldn't you like to just slap him
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:59] y'all act like y'all so religious i'm
[1:14:01] sorry
[1:14:03] you know my thing is i don't i don't i
[1:14:06] don't uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:14:09] i i can't say that about anybody else
[1:14:11] but the devil
[1:14:13] yes if god gave me uh a place to slap
[1:14:17] him
[1:14:17] i would
[1:14:21] there's an angel that's going to throw
[1:14:22] him in the lake of fire do you really
[1:14:24] think the angel's going to say oh lord i
[1:14:26] really don't want to do this
[1:14:29] there are going to be people on the
[1:14:30] shore somewhere
[1:14:32] and i'm one of them somewhere that's
[1:14:34] going to be dancing and shouting
[1:14:38] trouble's over this thing we will never
[1:14:42] can you imagine never having to deal
[1:14:45] with him again
[1:14:47] now let me tell you something
[1:14:48] something's wrong with a man if he
[1:14:49] doesn't want to go help go to heaven
[1:14:51] or at least escape this world right
[1:14:55] something's wrong you see it falling
[1:14:57] apart
[1:14:58] people are killing each other for no
[1:15:00] apparent reason
[1:15:01] it ain't just strangers families fathers
[1:15:04] mothers sisters brothers
[1:15:06] killing one another under the
[1:15:08] inspiration of the devil
[1:15:12] a friend of mine just was witnessing to
[1:15:14] a person there in
[1:15:15] in ohio and this young man i think in
[1:15:18] his 20s he's been
[1:15:19] witnessing to him and so he fell away
[1:15:22] and he came back
[1:15:23] and then that time he wanted to talk to
[1:15:25] him but the lord kept showing
[1:15:27] him vindicating to him that he shouldn't
[1:15:28] go to his brother's house
[1:15:31] and um you know as a natural
[1:15:35] thing started happening seeing spiders
[1:15:37] and things that were just
[1:15:39] not normal so he he gathered the
[1:15:41] information no i better not
[1:15:43] he told a man young man i'm not coming
[1:15:46] and the young man committed suicide
[1:15:48] and i told his brother i said he was
[1:15:50] waiting on you
[1:15:53] had you gone out when god told you not
[1:15:56] to
[1:15:57] you would have been a victim of his
[1:15:59] scene
[1:16:00] see god protects us like that
[1:16:04] he protects us and i told her brother i
[1:16:06] said don't feel bad brother
[1:16:08] you did everything you could do for that
[1:16:10] young man
[1:16:12] but look what his intent was he said
[1:16:15] well brother brooks what are you telling
[1:16:16] listen i've had the experience when this
[1:16:19] i was supposed to
[1:16:20] uh rendezvous and meet with this one
[1:16:22] person
[1:16:23] and the holy spirit said don't do it
[1:16:27] i was going to do it and i had no idea
[1:16:31] that this this man was waiting to jump
[1:16:34] me
[1:16:34] to beat me here in iowa
[1:16:39] and i found out later through a person
[1:16:42] who knew him
[1:16:43] and they told me what his intent was
[1:16:46] you say god don't protect it god will
[1:16:49] protect you
[1:16:53] concerning about true worship in the
[1:16:55] spirit and truth
[1:16:56] listen we must understand that this
[1:16:57] message is giving us a mindset
[1:17:00] this is why you need to listen to
[1:17:01] brother branham you need to listen to
[1:17:03] what
[1:17:03] god speaks through him in these various
[1:17:06] messages
[1:17:07] because it literally elevates you from
[1:17:10] being just a sinner
[1:17:11] but to a person who has been totally
[1:17:13] justified
[1:17:14] where there is no sin against you
[1:17:18] and so when you understand that you've
[1:17:19] been totally justified
[1:17:21] it puts you in a mindset you don't have
[1:17:23] to worry about your sins
[1:17:25] you don't have to worry about your
[1:17:27] failures because the blood of jesus
[1:17:29] christ has
[1:17:30] cleansed you from all unrighteousness
[1:17:32] hallelujah
[1:17:33] god has already taken care of that you
[1:17:35] don't worry about that
[1:17:36] you need to learn how to press into the
[1:17:39] message of the hour
[1:17:41] press into the mindset of god
[1:17:44] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:17:46] christ jesus
[1:17:49] stop thinking like men and failures and
[1:17:51] sinners and
[1:17:52] all of that god didn't answer the same
[1:17:54] question
[1:17:57] oh jesus help me you see because what
[1:18:00] the devil does he pulls us back into the
[1:18:02] legalistic mind
[1:18:04] that if i do this he'll be merciful to
[1:18:08] me
[1:18:09] god has already been merciful to you in
[1:18:11] that while you were yes a similar christ
[1:18:13] died for you
[1:18:14] not when you was good who can be good
[1:18:16] enough
[1:18:17] who can be good enough the bible says
[1:18:20] there was not
[1:18:21] one worthy to open the book can i just
[1:18:24] jump a little bit let me just do it
[1:18:27] not worthy to open the book all the
[1:18:30] loose the seals there are
[1:18:33] none none of us in here
[1:18:36] so what is it we needed his grace
[1:18:40] we needed his love don't you understand
[1:18:42] this
[1:18:43] is the age of love his love
[1:18:46] we love him because he first loved us
[1:18:51] hallelujah the true love of god amen
[1:18:54] like paul said
[1:18:55] being said abroad in our hearts it gets
[1:18:58] better all the time
[1:19:01] yeah it's moving
[1:19:05] you just feel those good feelings you
[1:19:06] know
[1:19:08] folks are caught up i'm feeling pretty
[1:19:10] good
[1:19:11] you just feel those good feelings amen
[1:19:13] that you ever heard
[1:19:14] somebody massaging your heart you ever
[1:19:16] had that you leave church and you feel
[1:19:18] like somebody just massaged your heart
[1:19:20] and
[1:19:21] oh you just feel so good
[1:19:25] there's no other way i can explain it
[1:19:29] hallelujah amen coming from the message
[1:19:32] amen it is the rising of the sun he goes
[1:19:35] on to
[1:19:36] say now you are already
[1:19:39] resurrected see that's what the devil
[1:19:41] don't want us to know
[1:19:42] he wants us to stay earthbound
[1:19:46] he just this in this third dimension
[1:19:49] when we're not supposed to be here
[1:19:53] we're supposed to be living in heavenly
[1:19:55] places thinking like they think
[1:20:00] we're the only beings that literally can
[1:20:03] see the future
[1:20:05] because we've been told the future
[1:20:10] the sun is just now on you listen
[1:20:14] he raised you the son s o n is now
[1:20:17] on you and now you're growing into a
[1:20:20] blossom
[1:20:21] like he was growing into it
[1:20:26] you understand me it just don't say no
[1:20:29] you grow
[1:20:29] you know how many y'all ever seen a
[1:20:31] blossom open
[1:20:34] not with your natural nature uh maybe
[1:20:36] somebody has filmed it
[1:20:38] and you see how delicate it just opens
[1:20:41] up like a
[1:20:42] a dancer you know and
[1:20:45] and but but listen it happens it's
[1:20:48] happening
[1:20:49] not tomorrow it's now happening you say
[1:20:52] what do you mean
[1:20:53] that's why you're here something is
[1:20:55] happening
[1:20:56] in you something drew you something's
[1:21:00] moving in you
[1:21:01] it doesn't matter how many times you
[1:21:04] failed
[1:21:04] amen it's what's moving in you right now
[1:21:08] this flesh is sin hallelujah
[1:21:11] but the guy inside the man inside the
[1:21:14] god that's inside
[1:21:15] he's perfect and because he's perfect
[1:21:20] he makes this thing perfect
[1:21:25] hallelujah he was raised to be
[1:21:27] resurrected completely
[1:21:28] in the last days huh
[1:21:32] you hear what he said he was raised
[1:21:35] to be made perfectly right
[1:21:39] to be resurrected completely in that
[1:21:42] last day
[1:21:45] now his whole body which is you and me
[1:21:48] and all others who truly believe
[1:21:52] it's got to happen what's going to stop
[1:21:54] it you think the stone of a roman stone
[1:21:57] can stop it
[1:21:57] you think roman soldiers can stop it you
[1:22:00] think political lies can stop it
[1:22:02] nothing can stop this resurrection the
[1:22:05] devil is upset
[1:22:06] this is why he's doing everything he can
[1:22:09] to distract you
[1:22:12] but what he doesn't understand if you're
[1:22:14] dead you're just dead
[1:22:16] you can't distract a dead man
[1:22:20] your potentials right you have now
[1:22:24] why do you know your soul changed
[1:22:28] didn't it your body come in obedience to
[1:22:31] it
[1:22:32] didn't it in obedience to what the
[1:22:34] church know the word
[1:22:36] which is the life then you are now
[1:22:38] resurrected from the dead
[1:22:40] it is an easter with jesus and i it's
[1:22:43] easter with you and jesus
[1:22:44] and it's easter with you and i and jesus
[1:22:47] we are all
[1:22:48] or jesus you and i we are all
[1:22:52] resurrected together i believe that
[1:22:56] do i understand it no i don't have to
[1:22:58] understand it
[1:22:59] i don't understand why the sun shines
[1:23:02] but i can guarantee you it shines
[1:23:04] and every day it's going to shine it's
[1:23:07] going to shine while you live
[1:23:08] and it's going to shine when you die
[1:23:15] and it goes on and say and we will rise
[1:23:17] at that last day
[1:23:19] even see this is what i'm talking about
[1:23:21] somehow
[1:23:22] this joy that i'm looking to see in the
[1:23:24] people is just not there
[1:23:26] god it's just something lacking in the
[1:23:28] belief you got it here
[1:23:30] but he wants it here
[1:23:33] right and you got to understand this joy
[1:23:36] can
[1:23:36] only come if you press into it you got
[1:23:39] to press into it
[1:23:41] yes it's the devil's desire to shift you
[1:23:44] as we
[1:23:44] yes it is the desire to the devil's
[1:23:46] desire to take your joy
[1:23:48] hallelujah but listen if you're under
[1:23:51] the blood
[1:23:52] how can the devil take your jaw you must
[1:23:54] meet him somewhere
[1:23:55] there must be a rendezvous point
[1:24:00] oh but if you stay under the blood
[1:24:04] the devil can't do you no harm we will
[1:24:07] rise at that last day even
[1:24:08] though this our spirit leaves our body
[1:24:11] even though our body rust
[1:24:13] may they go to dust may they be burnt
[1:24:16] up may they be in the bottom of the sea
[1:24:18] the bible says
[1:24:19] that angel poured out his upon the sea
[1:24:22] and everything that died come up
[1:24:24] there is nothing can hide us or separate
[1:24:27] us
[1:24:27] from that god that we love so well that
[1:24:30] raised us
[1:24:31] up together you know what i'm saying
[1:24:34] that's why paul said nothing what what
[1:24:37] who shall separate me from the love of
[1:24:39] god
[1:24:40] right it ain't you it ain't about you
[1:24:43] loving him it's about him loving you he
[1:24:46] has determined that
[1:24:47] right therefore my heart is glad and
[1:24:50] my glory amen rejoices my flesh also
[1:24:54] shall rest in hope
[1:24:55] for thou will not leave my soul in hell
[1:24:57] neither will thou suffer thy holy one to
[1:25:00] see corruption
[1:25:01] see can't go until he can't go not and
[1:25:03] this rapture can't go until the last one
[1:25:05] comes in
[1:25:06] i'm almost done with the segment of it
[1:25:13] i'm coming to something
[1:25:18] because we got to ask god to deliver us
[1:25:19] from this laziness
[1:25:22] this lazy spirit that hinders us in our
[1:25:24] prayer this lazy spirit that hinders us
[1:25:27] in our study
[1:25:29] this lazy spirit amen that hinders us
[1:25:31] from witnessing
[1:25:33] you know them it's the devil now the
[1:25:36] devil cannot take away
[1:25:38] from you who you are you are who you
[1:25:41] are but he surely can hinder you
[1:25:45] he can hinder you see brother adam said
[1:25:48] that's what got the church into trouble
[1:25:50] today
[1:25:50] is too many educated preachers without
[1:25:53] being born of the spirit
[1:25:55] you know what i mean don't you see this
[1:25:57] kind of preaching
[1:25:59] a lot of people don't like it because
[1:26:00] i'm not dramatizing this stuff
[1:26:02] you know i'm leaving hollywood out of it
[1:26:06] huh oh i can get you going now
[1:26:10] but that ain't it i've learned we have
[1:26:13] left out of this place where josh
[1:26:14] oh was that a powerful message
[1:26:18] but with no change
[1:26:22] need change we need the quickening of
[1:26:25] the holy spirit we need something that
[1:26:26] will be
[1:26:27] said that's going to come and change the
[1:26:29] inside out
[1:26:32] too many educated preachers without
[1:26:34] being born of the spirit
[1:26:36] men and women like to listen to the
[1:26:38] intellectual speeches
[1:26:40] instead of preaching the power and the
[1:26:42] resurrection
[1:26:43] of jesus christ now watch this now no
[1:26:46] matter how
[1:26:46] deep brother branham was he
[1:26:50] never left out the resurrection he never
[1:26:53] left out the fact
[1:26:54] you and i need the holy ghost
[1:26:57] he always brought you back to calvary in
[1:27:00] some way
[1:27:00] or another his message is always
[1:27:04] brought you to a place where you wanted
[1:27:06] more of god
[1:27:07] hallelujah have you ever gotten jealous
[1:27:11] of some of the things that's happening
[1:27:12] on the tapes
[1:27:15] i'm gonna be honest me i am lord what
[1:27:18] about me
[1:27:21] what about me i wasn't there
[1:27:25] and you said blessed is the man who have
[1:27:26] not seen yet believe
[1:27:28] i'm more blessed but i want that kind
[1:27:32] of a change change wasn't difficult
[1:27:36] and listen no man was doing it he
[1:27:38] couldn't do it brother man couldn't do
[1:27:39] any of that
[1:27:40] he told us that's not me it's him and
[1:27:43] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:27:45] and forever then if he did it then
[1:27:47] he can do it now but what were those
[1:27:50] people
[1:27:51] doing that we then that we're not doing
[1:27:53] now
[1:27:54] and that is believing
[1:27:57] honestly believing because the angel of
[1:28:00] the lord had already told brother
[1:28:01] branham
[1:28:01] you get the people to believe that all
[1:28:04] things are possible
[1:28:06] somehow they're believing better than
[1:28:08] what we're believing
[1:28:10] you see because the truth of the matter
[1:28:13] is all you need to do is really have the
[1:28:15] faith of god
[1:28:16] and believe they understood that was god
[1:28:20] one occasion this woman had heard
[1:28:24] that this man this blind man received
[1:28:26] his sight
[1:28:27] her baby died and she said if god
[1:28:30] could give a man who was blind and sight
[1:28:33] back
[1:28:35] god can raise my baby from the dead
[1:28:38] you see what i'm saying that's what
[1:28:39] those tapes are for
[1:28:41] to build your faith of things that has
[1:28:44] already happened
[1:28:45] and i say it like this if god amen open
[1:28:48] the blinded eyes then
[1:28:50] he can do it now if god raised the dead
[1:28:53] then
[1:28:53] he can do it now it wasn't the man it
[1:28:56] was the spirit in the man
[1:28:58] now they had shipped the capstone has
[1:29:00] come
[1:29:02] the god who was doing it all has now
[1:29:05] become
[1:29:05] visible to to those who truly believe
[1:29:11] even nicodemus was able to recognize
[1:29:13] something lord
[1:29:14] we know no man can do these things that
[1:29:17] you do
[1:29:18] except he except god be with him
[1:29:23] instead of preaching the power and the
[1:29:25] resurrection of jesus christ see that's
[1:29:26] what got us into trouble today
[1:29:28] we don't need any more high school
[1:29:31] and education from preachers
[1:29:34] and y'all know this is true the message
[1:29:37] went through a very intellectual stage
[1:29:40] and everybody thought they were in a
[1:29:42] revival
[1:29:44] but when they came out of revival there
[1:29:46] was no power behind what they learned
[1:29:50] you don't have to acknowledge it i was
[1:29:52] there i've seen it
[1:29:54] and everybody flocked around the
[1:29:56] preachers who could bring it deeper
[1:29:59] but where is the change
[1:30:03] somewhere amen in all of that depth we
[1:30:06] miss the quickening
[1:30:08] you know why because in that age or in
[1:30:11] that little
[1:30:11] period of time men were being glorified
[1:30:16] and not god and that's why brother
[1:30:19] branham said see he said even in that
[1:30:21] message he said it's not good to say
[1:30:23] brother so-and-so did this and brother
[1:30:24] so-and-so did that he said because
[1:30:26] people have a tendency to look toward
[1:30:28] the man
[1:30:29] than god that's
[1:30:32] almost a direct quote
[1:30:36] so bringing it down to you
[1:30:40] where is your god
[1:30:44] where is your god where is your god
[1:30:51] if you got him in heaven still he's in
[1:30:52] the wrong place
[1:30:57] in that day
[1:31:02] you know i'm in the father the father's
[1:31:04] in me
[1:31:05] and i am in you and if you still got him
[1:31:09] in heaven
[1:31:11] you got him in the wrong place
[1:31:14] he needs to be here on the throne of
[1:31:17] your heart
[1:31:18] the bible says know ye not that i you
[1:31:21] are the temple of god
[1:31:26] my kingdom was of this but if my kingdom
[1:31:28] was of this world then my
[1:31:30] subject would fight my kingdom is above
[1:31:34] but he said when you pray pray thy
[1:31:36] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[1:31:39] like it is on heaven i'm gonna leave
[1:31:41] that there
[1:31:42] by god's grace
[1:31:46] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:31:51] in earth as it is in heaven
[1:31:54] however i'm living there i must come to
[1:31:58] live here
[1:32:00] that's the prayer he prayed back then
[1:32:03] the kingdom had not yet come
[1:32:05] but the kingdom has come the kingdom is
[1:32:08] the holy
[1:32:09] ghost is that the word it is the kingdom
[1:32:12] righteousness peace
[1:32:16] and joy where in the holy ghost
[1:32:20] so you got to understand this thing got
[1:32:22] a shift
[1:32:26] the pill of fire if you still got it
[1:32:29] above brother branham's head
[1:32:30] you got it in the wrong place
[1:32:35] the pillow fire has moved
[1:32:39] and it's behind the veil
[1:32:44] it's on the mercy seat oh
[1:32:49] you understand me he said well we hadn't
[1:32:52] seen the pillow fire
[1:32:55] well i've seen him in my day but you
[1:32:56] know what seeing the pillow fire didn't
[1:32:58] save me
[1:33:02] i've seen a lot of miraculous uh uh
[1:33:05] signs and everything on pictures
[1:33:06] but it does it didn't save me
[1:33:10] i remember when brother craig and i went
[1:33:12] down to jeffersonville we took a picture
[1:33:15] together above his head uh uh
[1:33:18] uh was the form of a dove and above my
[1:33:21] head was the form of a lamb
[1:33:23] but it didn't save me
[1:33:27] i've seen ministers with the pill of
[1:33:29] fire in their background and people goes
[1:33:31] to worship with them like there's some
[1:33:33] kind of god sent
[1:33:34] angel well no dayton and carl
[1:33:37] cora saw the pillar of fire
[1:33:41] if they had photography they could have
[1:33:43] showed them in the picture
[1:33:47] that doesn't save you nor does it make
[1:33:49] you elected
[1:33:52] is when the god of heaven comes down
[1:33:56] and abode with you just like he abode
[1:33:59] with his dear son
[1:34:01] and was able to say in whom
[1:34:06] i am well pleased to dwell in
[1:34:10] this is what this message is all about
[1:34:13] is to produce
[1:34:15] more messiahs little jesus
[1:34:18] is amateur gods
[1:34:22] and that's the only way it could ever
