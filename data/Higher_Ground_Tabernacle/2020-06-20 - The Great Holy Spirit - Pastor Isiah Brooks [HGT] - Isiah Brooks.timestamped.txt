[28:40] and we've got no things are going we
[29:05] know that the earth is at a position
[29:11] where it is just preparing itself for
[29:16] fire baptism there is no hiding place
[29:35] how you want to say it but we are
[29:39] looking for a translation and the only
[29:43] way that we're going to see that is that
[29:45] we God's Way of provision I have a
[29:52] friend
[30:17] father God we come before your Lord and
[30:19] thank you for your amazing grace he
[30:22] thank you for being so good to us
[30:24] you have been better to us we have been
[30:27] to ourselves we thank you for being so
[30:31] good to us we come in contact with this
[30:43] virus that what ever they must go
[30:48] through I pray that we're praying right
[30:52] now for total deliverance and healing
[30:57] people that you have purchased with your
[31:01] blood we pray that you would give them
[31:03] complete victory Lord in your name we
[31:06] pray that you would bless the family the
[31:11] church family their Lord that you would
[31:13] rid them of this devil you sent Lord in
[31:16] your word no evil shall come nigh our
[31:19] dwelling place and father we believe
[31:21] that Satan tempt us but it can't
[31:24] overcome you are the overcome a Lord and
[31:27] we pray father God that you would touch
[31:29] everybody each and every one of them
[31:32] that have come in contact with this
[31:33] spirit and that you will appreciate the
[31:44] Lord Jesus Christ as we stand I
[31:47] appreciate that
[31:48] song amen Oh Lord I remember when I
[31:53] first came into the message the stomping
[32:00] of the feet and the clapping of their
[32:02] hands we would have such a great Jubilee
[32:05] I'll try my best not to be long I've got
[32:09] my grandson Nehemiah with me surprise he
[32:17] came to play the guitar but I told him
[32:20] that was gonna
[32:25] but anyway I said that just so I won't
[32:27] forget
[32:29] god is good to us and as we stand let us
[32:33] turn to acts 1 in 8 we're going to be
[32:41] ministering tonight on the Great Holy
[32:43] Spirit sometimes I think people think
[32:48] that the Holy Spirit showed up at the
[32:52] time but we want everybody to know that
[32:57] the Holy Spirit has been here when no
[33:00] one else was the Holy Spirit is not a
[33:03] second person or third person he is the
[33:07] person he is Elohim itself existing one
[33:12] and so I'm bringing these things out
[33:15] tonight so that we can see the battle
[33:18] that we have in front of us that we must
[33:21] face I can recall in a point in time
[33:27] when Paulo said that he would be in
[33:29] bondage to no man and you and I must
[33:32] know that we must have that Constitution
[33:36] as well that we were in bondage acts 1
[33:43] in 8 reads but ye shall receive power
[33:46] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[33:50] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[33:53] both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in
[33:57] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[34:00] the earth
[34:02] can we go also to acts 2:17 beginning
[34:09] aired at the 17th verse at the 2nd
[34:11] chapter in the book of Acts and Akane
[34:15] and it shall come to pass in the last
[34:18] days I like that ya see God I will pour
[34:25] out my spirit upon all flesh and your
[34:28] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[34:31] and your young men shall see visions and
[34:33] your old men shall dream dreams
[34:37] and on my servants and on my handmaidens
[34:39] I will pour out in those days of my
[34:42] spirit and they shall prophesy and I
[34:46] will show wonders in heaven above and
[34:49] signs in the earth beneath blood and
[34:52] fire vapor of smoke the Sun shall be
[34:56] turned into darkness and the moon into
[34:59] blood before that great and notable day
[35:03] of the Lord come and it shall come to
[35:06] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[35:09] name of the Lord shall say let us pray
[35:15] father God we come before your Lord as
[35:18] humble as we know how we thank you for
[35:21] being good to us you say this all the
[35:26] time because father Lord tonight
[35:41] they made a sacrifice and I pray father
[35:44] that you know in your book like Oh God
[35:50] we pray tonight we come to lift you up
[35:53] big where ever the name Jesus has spoken
[35:56] we we get happy and glad Lord because we
[36:02] realize tonight there is no other name
[36:04] given under heaven whereby we must be
[36:06] saved there is no substitute or any type
[36:12] of generic brand that of you that we
[36:14] could fall to there is only one true and
[36:18] living God and his name and your name is
[36:21] the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Father
[36:24] for allowing us to be here we pray that
[36:28] you would bless the word and North the
[36:29] word and launch a service service but
[36:33] give us for any and everything that we
[36:34] have done that have not been according
[36:36] to your word Lord we are the dust of the
[36:39] earth we are word that the Scriptures
[36:42] saying we are we are creatures
[36:54] you may be seated there are so many
[37:00] people today and I'm just going to kind
[37:01] of go in this kind of capacity but we
[37:05] believe that you receive the Holy Ghost
[37:10] by an experience now a lot of people say
[37:13] you don't have to experience anything
[37:16] but according to the message of the
[37:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost nineteen fifty
[37:21] eight nine and twenty eight the prophet
[37:24] of God said we believe that includes
[37:26] himself that we must have an experience
[37:29] not by their mystical intellectual
[37:33] conception of the scripture but by an
[37:36] experience that you you alone know now
[37:39] if you want to know whether it was the
[37:43] Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns
[37:46] after that it'll tell what kind of a
[37:49] spirit come into you I think that's the
[37:52] greatest way of looking at it if you are
[37:55] Christian and you say you got the Holy
[37:57] Ghost
[37:57] what is the reflection of your life
[38:00] after the experience that is the thing
[38:03] that tells you what's on the inside now
[38:06] a lot of time when people get the Holy
[38:08] Ghost they they make excuses and we all
[38:15] have done it many times we say well you
[38:18] know we're saved by grace that's
[38:21] absolutely the truth but we also know
[38:25] that Jesus says if you love me you'll
[38:28] keep my Commandments there's a law
[38:31] that's greater than all laws and that is
[38:34] the law of love and we know that when it
[38:38] comes to God and God's people in this
[38:42] last day the people lack love and love
[38:46] for God I must say that again the people
[38:51] are lacking the love of and the love for
[38:54] God and we know that the love of the
[38:59] truth about that you must love truth
[39:01] and we understand that God is true he is
[39:05] the only truth everything else is a lie
[39:08] all right and because they asked Pilate
[39:12] I believe I asked him what is true when
[39:15] he already knew the answer because he
[39:18] went out to the audience that was about
[39:21] to crucify him and he said Pilate said I
[39:24] find no fault in him and that that is
[39:28] how truth is expressed you can't find
[39:32] any Fault in the truth now we realize
[39:35] that we are preparing for a world to
[39:38] come this is what it's all about
[39:42] according to st. John 14 I believe Jesus
[39:45] said let not your heart be troubled if
[39:49] you believe in God believe also in me
[39:51] and he goes on to say that he in his
[39:56] father's house there are many mentioned
[39:57] and if it wasn't so he would not have
[39:59] told you he goes on to say I'm going to
[40:02] prepare a place for you that where I am
[40:05] there ye may be also so we realized that
[40:09] the Holy Goals did not come to the world
[40:12] just to make you feel good and it's not
[40:15] a feel-good thing it's all about the
[40:18] character of Christ and this is where we
[40:21] we seem to fall short churches all over
[40:25] the world they figure if you could shout
[40:27] if you could dance if you can speak in
[40:29] tongues if you can run up and down the
[40:30] aisle you know pay your tithes whatever
[40:33] feel away with the wind fear the fire
[40:35] see the fire you know all of those
[40:38] things are great and all of those things
[40:39] are good but you can do all those things
[40:42] and have the experience of all those
[40:45] things and still yet not have the Holy
[40:47] Ghost
[40:48] the Bible says make your calling and
[40:50] election sure and I know one thing one
[40:54] real real true way of receiving the real
[40:57] Holy Ghost it is according to acts 2 and
[41:00] 38 where the Bible says repent to be
[41:03] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[41:05] the remission of your sins and you shall
[41:07] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[41:10] Holy Ghost is a transformer it comes to
[41:14] change
[41:15] you not only that it comes can I say it
[41:18] like this it literally comes to kill you
[41:22] it is here to burn all of the old world
[41:26] out of you said also that all of the new
[41:30] world can come into you the Bible calls
[41:34] us a chosen generation according to
[41:38] first Peter 2 and 9 through 10 it says
[41:42] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[41:44] priesthood and I want to bring that back
[41:48] down to a chosen generation because you
[41:52] must understand that when this was
[41:54] written I wasn't there but in that
[41:58] phrase generation or in that word phrase
[42:04] chosen generation it means that God's
[42:07] generation is not according to time but
[42:13] it's according to eternity and when God
[42:16] chooses you he told you not in the time
[42:22] that you was born or in the time that
[42:25] you decided to be a Christian but the
[42:28] Bible tells us that he chose us before
[42:31] the foundation of the world he chose us
[42:35] amen and put our names in the Lamb's
[42:38] Book of Life before the foundation of
[42:41] the world in the beginning so you say
[42:45] well brother what are you saying
[42:47] we come to recognize our salvation but
[42:52] we who are chosen of God must understand
[42:55] that we have a covenant which is
[42:58] unconditional which is something that
[43:01] God did himself it's not what you do for
[43:05] him is what he does for you and we must
[43:09] understand that the Holy Ghost is a seal
[43:12] of promise you understand me
[43:15] that means before the foundation of the
[43:17] world God promised you and me you and I
[43:21] he promised us that he would give us
[43:24] only ghost with the seal it would be
[43:27] your seal
[43:29] hallelujah and if God promised it
[43:32] nothing can stop him from doing so I
[43:37] believe this is why Paul said who can
[43:42] separate me from the love of God nothing
[43:46] no trials no tribulations no failures
[43:50] hello because the probably God
[43:53] displaying to us he says you and I were
[43:55] failures to begin with but God makes us
[44:01] victorious by giving us his holy spirit
[44:06] hallelujah I love it I love it
[44:09] a royal priest you're not just a chosen
[44:12] generation but we are a royalty we are a
[44:16] holy nation a peculiar people that we
[44:20] should show forth the praises of him who
[44:22] have called you out of darkness and I
[44:25] trust you've been called out of darkness
[44:27] you can't stand in darkness and light at
[44:29] the same time you either got to be in
[44:31] darkness or in light is that right the
[44:34] Bible said make your eye single because
[44:38] of your eye or double the Bible says
[44:40] you're still in darkness in other words
[44:43] you're still double minded Alleluia that
[44:48] means a lot to me when I think about
[44:50] making my eyes single is that right
[44:54] because Jesus told that woman at the
[44:57] well I'm gonna give you water where
[45:00] you're never third again and a true
[45:04] Christian with the true experience never
[45:06] thirst for the things of the world
[45:09] doesn't mean it doesn't temptation
[45:12] doesn't come but you don't thirst for oh
[45:16] no no hallelujah
[45:19] Satan will come here tempt you here try
[45:22] you because of this flesh but it is the
[45:25] inner meaning that locks the outer man
[45:28] down is that right
[45:30] it's the inner man it's that Holy Ghost
[45:32] feel in a man a man that pushed his
[45:36] flesh in his place
[45:39] hallelujah oh my
[45:42] the piper tells us there was a time when
[45:44] we weren't people but we we became
[45:48] people because of God's election because
[45:51] of God's foreknowledge and and we know
[45:55] that by God's grace he called us we
[45:57] didn't choose him he chose us and
[46:00] because of this you we could you quit I
[46:03] don't know how else to say it
[46:05] but we can roll our shoulders back in
[46:08] confidence that he that begun the good
[46:11] work in you is completely its faithful
[46:14] nothing he's not slack about it he's
[46:17] faithful to complete it hallelujah I
[46:22] just wanna read something here because
[46:28] you and I have heard of the story of
[46:32] Samuel and Saul and this comes the
[46:40] portion I'm going to read will be coming
[46:42] from First Samuel 11th chapter 2 through
[46:45] 4 y'all remember when the people of God
[46:49] Israel wanted a king and they had Samuel
[46:55] the Prophet but they wanted a king and
[46:58] that's just the way it is people are
[47:00] like that all over the world they like
[47:03] that in churches they're like that like
[47:05] the probably God said if the preacher's
[47:07] wife wear a certain kind of hat next
[47:10] Sunday you're going to find other people
[47:11] with the same kind of hat because people
[47:14] will not they want to imitate they love
[47:16] to look like somebody else or they like
[47:18] to be in the uppity up but a real
[47:21] Christian could care less and you and I
[47:26] must understand by God's grace this is
[47:28] where you come in
[47:30] we're not followers of the crowd every
[47:35] man must stand for himself most of the
[47:40] time the majority is wrong but the Bible
[47:47] tells us that God has never left himself
[47:50] without a witness now you know the story
[47:55] it really broke samia's hard because
[47:58] samuel was a faithful prophet he he
[48:02] literally loved the people of Israel he
[48:06] never took their money he never abused
[48:08] him he never had a bad report he was a
[48:12] real reflection of God and matter of
[48:14] fact where the Benham said that Sam you
[48:17] in this story is likened unto the Holy
[48:19] Spirit and we find out that what had
[48:22] happened is that the people wanted a
[48:26] king they looked around they saw the
[48:27] Baptist the Methodist Presbyterian the
[48:30] Pentecostals and message people and they
[48:35] wanted a king when they already had one
[48:40] the King wasn't samuel but the king was
[48:43] living in samuel it was God
[48:47] a man manifested in flesh right before
[48:49] them but they weren't satisfied they
[48:53] wanted a salt and if you read first
[48:57] samuel 11 you'll find out that right at
[49:00] the time that they were choosing saw
[49:03] there was a king by the name of me hash
[49:07] he was an Emma Knight and the Bible said
[49:11] he came up and encamped about just the
[49:14] Gilead and all the being of judgment
[49:17] said unto me hash make a covenant with
[49:19] us and we will serve you now somehow
[49:23] they had lost a vision already had they
[49:26] understood that Shammi was a dead that
[49:29] mean God wasn't dead either
[49:31] now be all fainting in some way they
[49:36] want a king but now they're confronted
[49:39] they've got something that that that not
[49:42] that now is going to confront them and
[49:44] look how look how weak they are they
[49:46] they're ready to submit until they Emma
[49:50] nice now let me read on and they hatch
[49:54] they emanate answered them on this
[49:57] condition will I make a covenant with
[49:59] you that I made thrust out all your
[50:03] right eyes and lay it for a reproach
[50:06] upon all Israel see
[50:09] is that they were moving away from the
[50:12] inspiration of the holy spirit being led
[50:15] by God and wanted to become a system
[50:19] Saul is a type of the system Saul is a
[50:23] type of the denomination in organization
[50:26] hallelujah they big they seem to be
[50:29] above everybody else great Baptist
[50:33] Methodist Catholic Presbyterian you name
[50:36] it but there's always a small little
[50:39] group that will always stay with the
[50:43] leadership of the Holy Spirit but what
[50:47] was it
[50:48] can you imagine you're in a war or
[50:51] somebody coming to take over your
[50:54] country or your city or your church how
[50:56] it may be and they said but I make a
[50:59] covenant in other words I'll let you
[51:00] live but I want to take out your right
[51:02] eye now you must understand that the
[51:06] right eye is the spiritual eye you know
[51:11] when they chose Saul
[51:14] God was showing them right at the moment
[51:16] you haven't lost your right eye and I'm
[51:21] gonna read something for you in just a
[51:22] moment and the elders of jabish said
[51:25] unto him give us seven days respite that
[51:28] we may send messengers and to all of the
[51:32] coast of Israel and then if there be no
[51:34] man to save us we will come out to be
[51:38] chief they forgotten about God they have
[51:41] forgotten about the Holy Spirit right
[51:43] and they forgot that samuel was there
[51:47] hallelujah now you say what brother was
[51:49] what he just just bear with me for a
[51:51] moment
[51:52] then came the messages to Gilead of Saul
[51:55] and told the tidings in the ears of the
[51:58] people and all the people lifted their
[52:01] voices and wept
[52:04] hey there was afraid and that's the way
[52:08] it usually is when you leave God when
[52:11] you leave the leadership of the Holy
[52:12] Spirit fear accompany come be you is
[52:15] that right I heard the prophet of God
[52:17] said he said Samuel represented the holy
[52:22] spirit
[52:24] it's all represented the system and the
[52:28] people chose saw over the holy spirit
[52:34] and remember when Saul did what he did
[52:39] God gave him an evil spirit and when you
[52:44] reject the Holy Ghost God will give you
[52:47] an evil spirit that's why you see people
[52:51] fussing and fighting and nagging
[52:54] nationally each other and supposed to be
[52:56] Christians because somewhere they have
[52:59] missed the Holy Ghost and God has given
[53:02] them an evil spirit and they don't even
[53:05] know it coming from the message reject
[53:11] the king I told you I was gonna take my
[53:13] time after all the warnings had been
[53:17] given then finally they wanted the king
[53:20] anyhow so Saul was anointed king
[53:23] the first thing taking place the enemy
[53:28] slipped in on one side and put the right
[53:31] eye out of a lot of the people of God
[53:33] you know the story is found here in
[53:36] Samuel he goes on to say 8 9 10 but it
[53:39] was found in 11 but there but there
[53:42] right I put that right out can you
[53:45] imagine that that's just what the enemy
[53:48] wants to do that's what the enemy is
[53:51] trying to do tonight is put the right
[53:54] eye of God people out come on that's
[53:58] happening right now
[54:00] everywhere you go the enemy is trying to
[54:04] put the right out out people the system
[54:08] is the spirit like Laodicea is
[54:11] experienced hallelujah but the Bible
[54:14] says they that are led by the sons of
[54:16] led by the Spirit they are the sons of
[54:19] God hallelujah right that's what the
[54:25] enemy is trying to do tonight put the
[54:27] right eye of God's people out you notice
[54:31] that it was the right eye the one that
[54:35] spiritual if he can put
[54:37] spiritual sight out of your eye where
[54:40] you see the natural things and not the
[54:42] spiritual things he's got you whipped
[54:45] right there right and that's what
[54:48] happens to Israel happen many times it
[54:50] happened when Pharaoh came upon them
[54:52] they lost it right I think they became
[54:55] carnal Lord did you call us out here to
[54:58] die
[54:59] hallelujah it took God to give them
[55:03] sight again hallelujah David is the only
[55:06] one that I know at at the time of war
[55:09] you know he did not lose his eyesight
[55:11] when it came to Goliath he knew what God
[55:15] had done with the lion the bear and he
[55:16] knew that his his eyesight was clear I'm
[55:20] not the one that's doing the work he's
[55:21] doing the work and I'm gonna follow him
[55:24] no matter how foolishly it may appear to
[55:27] all the others I'm gonna be led by the
[55:29] Holy Ghost you say well what about the
[55:33] whole church all of Israel backed up in
[55:36] a corner Wow because they will come they
[55:39] lost the right eye the lie is Bluffs
[55:41] Goliath threats made them forget who
[55:45] their God was hallelujah but when a with
[55:48] a real true son and daughter of God when
[55:51] they are spiritual nothing can put their
[55:54] outside out they don't have to see God
[55:57] they don't have to feel him because they
[55:59] know he's dead
[56:00] I'll never leave you nor will I forsake
[56:02] you that's what's happening to a lot of
[56:06] Christians right now first of all when
[56:09] the devil put your right eye out the
[56:11] first thing you must know is that you
[56:13] don't love God the way you used to love
[56:16] huh
[56:17] that's what happened it's real they lost
[56:19] it first love why would you wanna King
[56:23] when God has given you everything his
[56:26] protection was already there hallelujah
[56:29] and you and I must understand why would
[56:31] I need you know I'm your pastor but I'm
[56:34] not your head I can make pulses follow
[56:37] me as I follow Christ
[56:39] but the moment I stopped following
[56:40] Christ you don't have to follow me cuz
[56:44] you're not following me anyhow
[56:45] you're following Christ hallelujah
[56:49] brother branham said it like this he
[56:51] said like
[56:51] it's so confused uh he said that's what
[56:54] happens sometimes he said I got
[56:57] something in my mind in my heart to do
[56:59] and I'm just I could tell you where to
[57:01] find it but he said didn't I have
[57:03] somebody say well brother Bentham the
[57:05] Lord told me that tell you that you
[57:07] should go here and then another person
[57:09] says the Lord told me to tell you that
[57:11] you should go he said that's what makes
[57:14] me so nervous because people want me to
[57:17] do what they want me to do he said from
[57:19] now I'm gonna do what God tells me to do
[57:22] see and you have to learn to be able to
[57:26] hear the voice of God the leadership of
[57:30] God is an individual thing you must be
[57:34] able to have another only goes to know
[57:36] when God is talking to you
[57:38] hallelujah I hope you're being blessed
[57:40] tonight I'm just taking my time anyway
[57:44] let's move on he goes on to say you
[57:46] noticed it was the right eye the one
[57:49] that spiritual if he could put that the
[57:52] spiritual right future sight out of your
[57:54] eyes where you were you see the natural
[57:57] things and not the spiritual things he's
[57:59] got you whipped right there and that's
[58:01] here it is that the Lord is soon to come
[58:03] we bout ready typical translation and
[58:06] everybody is trying to save their life
[58:09] I'm not talking about in the spiritual I
[58:11] mean in a natural I need a big I need a
[58:15] bigger car I need a bigger house I need
[58:17] this I need that I need this and the
[58:19] Bible said the cares of the world is
[58:22] going to choke the love of God out of
[58:24] their heart and that's what's happening
[58:27] people are more concerned about the way
[58:30] that's okay the Titanic is going down
[58:33] and I've got my jewels on the basement
[58:35] floor I got to run down to the basement
[58:38] floor to get my jewels and you treasure
[58:42] your jewels or possessions more than you
[58:44] do your life your life is the greatest
[58:47] thing you can possess it's the gift of
[58:51] God if I had been there I would have
[58:55] been looking for the first lifeboat a
[58:59] way of escape you understand me
[59:02] forget all of that if I live long
[59:05] I can get that and more but right now my
[59:08] life is a state and that's what's wrong
[59:11] and that's what's happening now our
[59:13] focus is being on everything but loving
[59:16] God but loving God oh I love God but I'm
[59:22] not willing to sacrifice don't you know
[59:24] that love is sacrificial you can't love
[59:27] somebody in those sacrifice Christ Jesus
[59:31] was the greatest sacrifice that God
[59:34] could ever give his whole life was
[59:39] toward others not himself
[59:41] fastest foxes have holes and birds have
[59:44] nests but the Son of man has no place to
[59:46] lay his oh my think about it he said
[59:55] brother listen what we mean today is an
[59:57] old time backward sing killing revival
[1:00:01] the Bible wholly goes back into the
[1:00:04] church a gain in the power God over the
[1:00:07] audience and the people filled with the
[1:00:10] Holy Ghost that's what we need today and
[1:00:13] if that would take place every wall of
[1:00:16] denomination differences would be broke
[1:00:18] down the oneness to Tunis to three mr.
[1:00:21] Church of God the pilgrim hole of this
[1:00:23] necromancy reason all of them together
[1:00:25] would be shouting and eating off the
[1:00:28] same Apple now I think about our group
[1:00:32] because we systemized it and you know we
[1:00:36] have come to a place where here ain't
[1:00:38] nobody else is going but us and none of
[1:00:41] us know that because a lot of us ain't
[1:00:45] going but message people don't want to
[1:00:48] hear that cause we're in the message
[1:00:51] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:00:53] look at the millions of Jews that was in
[1:00:56] the message
[1:00:59] billions and only two out of that
[1:01:02] generation cave and crossed over and you
[1:01:08] think God has just something with you
[1:01:10] know history repeats itself
[1:01:13] the only people that's going to cross
[1:01:16] over are those who are chosen
[1:01:18] elected of God to cross over whoever
[1:01:21] they may be because your religion is not
[1:01:25] what God is looking for God never looked
[1:01:28] for religion if he was looking for
[1:01:30] religion he wouldn't talk Adam and Eve
[1:01:32] that's okay
[1:01:33] what you did is okay no-ho-ho God is
[1:01:36] looking for life that comes from the
[1:01:39] blood that's what God is looking for
[1:01:43] when I see the Blood I pass over you
[1:01:47] that's the Holy Ghost in a mature way in
[1:01:50] our day hallelujah
[1:01:52] what emphasis or what of some of the
[1:01:54] other church agents were able to get get
[1:01:56] away with by God's grace you and I won't
[1:01:58] be right because remember even in the
[1:02:02] church age book when God began to bring
[1:02:06] Luther and Wesley and all of them out he
[1:02:09] told him you got a name you don't have
[1:02:12] my name but we won't his name this is
[1:02:16] what the message came to do give us his
[1:02:18] name and the only way we can have his
[1:02:21] name is through a marriage ceremony
[1:02:23] right that's gotta be an experience
[1:02:26] don't tell me oh I'm married but I never
[1:02:28] had an experience of it no that's a
[1:02:33] great celebration even in the natural
[1:02:35] when someone comes together to be
[1:02:37] married right and those God just don't
[1:02:41] you know we got those who said we're
[1:02:43] just gonna go to a judge and so I mean a
[1:02:44] real marriage with a real preacher
[1:02:46] you always have witnesses somebody to
[1:02:50] witness that you got married in the
[1:02:53] spiritual you have always somebody to
[1:02:56] witness what you've got listen he says
[1:03:08] listen why they would would would be so
[1:03:10] brotherly and sisterly there wouldn't be
[1:03:13] not even one thought of it but you see
[1:03:16] we will do pattern after something of
[1:03:18] the world and that's the thing everybody
[1:03:22] is this one gets me I don't care what
[1:03:25] they doing over in these different
[1:03:26] states in the different churches and
[1:03:28] what they do that's what they do we
[1:03:32] to be concerned about what we do what
[1:03:35] God is leading us to do
[1:03:37] we're not here to pattern after somebody
[1:03:39] else's church to become big and great
[1:03:41] like somebody else let us be us let us
[1:03:45] do what God has planted us to do here we
[1:03:47] are otherwise we become mimics of
[1:03:50] something else right like somebody else
[1:03:53] got a little preacher then we go get a
[1:03:55] little preacher looking for God is
[1:03:58] looking for originality he's looking for
[1:04:01] people who had contacted him and they
[1:04:04] are able to perform the Word of God
[1:04:05] wherever they may be wherever they live
[1:04:08] hallelujah and because other churches is
[1:04:11] doing certain things certain way does
[1:04:13] that make it message no what makes this
[1:04:18] message is the word all these other
[1:04:21] stuff is extra right you don't even have
[1:04:26] to sing to be in the message you don't
[1:04:30] have to be a preacher or nobody being
[1:04:33] what you do have to be is a child of God
[1:04:36] that's been born again of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:43] and what both know what people don't see
[1:04:47] is that sickness off in all this beauty
[1:04:49] and all this pomp he's there right but
[1:04:55] let's remember in choosing of the bride
[1:04:56] when that little girl who was a
[1:04:58] dishwasher wasn't popping about her
[1:05:03] wasn't nothing beautiful that we know of
[1:05:06] it was the character that man fell in
[1:05:09] love with this is what God falls in love
[1:05:11] with when it comes us character it must
[1:05:15] be his character let me hurry up
[1:05:17] a man she the same things got into our
[1:05:20] nation our nation used to be governed by
[1:05:23] real true politics Christians who go
[1:05:25] together and pray and come out or
[1:05:27] norwich and try to govern our nation's
[1:05:29] now it's just a honeycomb as it can be
[1:05:32] with everything cricket they tell me
[1:05:34] that the common is all over the country
[1:05:37] free thinkers and all them kinds of
[1:05:39] stuff of organization rising up and it's
[1:05:42] just in such a state there's there's not
[1:05:46] no stop to it and in it's only shows one
[1:05:49] thing that the true king the son of God
[1:05:52] is coming to take over and reign just as
[1:05:56] certain as we're in this convention
[1:05:58] tonight so you and I you said well what
[1:06:00] is this all of this is the coronaviruses
[1:06:02] for the bride
[1:06:04] trying to wake her up trying to shake
[1:06:07] her stir her up so that we can see the
[1:06:10] power of God that in just one Lumis time
[1:06:12] God shut the whole world out right not
[1:06:16] one nation could resist what God had
[1:06:18] allowed to be released and here we are
[1:06:22] looking right at it
[1:06:23] trade of it and unite in this time
[1:06:25] should be rejoicing because the Bible
[1:06:28] said look up when you see all of these
[1:06:31] things knowing that your Redemption
[1:06:33] draws nigh this is not a time to fear
[1:06:36] this is a time to - if I could say cheer
[1:06:39] and herald the coming of the Lord and
[1:06:45] see that's what happened to Samuel I saw
[1:06:47] excuse me Saul followed the Lord Jesus
[1:06:49] or could I say like this saw followed
[1:06:53] the Holy Spirit and whatever Samuel
[1:06:57] would tell him to do he did it but you
[1:06:59] remember the time that Sammy told him
[1:07:02] not to wait here till I get back I'll
[1:07:06] make up the offering the sacrifice unto
[1:07:10] the Lord and install God in himself
[1:07:13] because God had blessed and see that's
[1:07:15] what a lot of time happens to the people
[1:07:17] in the message they get really blessed
[1:07:18] and all of a sudden they figure they can
[1:07:20] say no no no no no because god bless you
[1:07:24] does it give thank you thank you so
[1:07:26] special that you can cross the line into
[1:07:29] sinning no we must always keep the Word
[1:07:33] of God first all the time and when God
[1:07:38] told Saul I saw
[1:07:40] sambito saw way here he had allowed the
[1:07:43] people to rush it
[1:07:45] Sammy is too late he's not he's not
[1:07:48] coming back you know and but we can't do
[1:07:50] what we need to do until the offering is
[1:07:52] made so what I'm saying to you that's
[1:07:58] that's a lot of
[1:07:59] a lot of preachers fall into that but
[1:08:03] pastor I just think we need to do this
[1:08:05] and pastor I think we need to do that
[1:08:06] and they don't never say well you know
[1:08:08] the Lord show room it's always I think I
[1:08:14] think anything about I think I can't
[1:08:17] even do what I think right we need to we
[1:08:21] need to really seek God at this power I
[1:08:23] believe with all my heart and maybe I'm
[1:08:25] crazy if I'm crazy I'm crazy but my
[1:08:28] point is I really believe that God want
[1:08:30] us to do a gonna have a revival in this
[1:08:32] city I believe that with all of my heart
[1:08:34] I just can't get through it I can't get
[1:08:36] over it it's just something that has
[1:08:38] been stamped in my heart even though I
[1:08:40] know people don't believe it's gonna
[1:08:41] happen but I believe that even with this
[1:08:45] little group if we get a lot of card and
[1:08:47] seek the Lord for his will it has to
[1:08:51] happen I believe that because all of you
[1:08:55] are expecting something you're looking
[1:08:58] for something something on the inside
[1:08:59] got you with an expectation that you
[1:09:02] can't even explain that's the Holy
[1:09:04] Spirit he puts the expansion expectation
[1:09:08] there so when it comes you'll recognize
[1:09:10] it and jump on there you know that
[1:09:15] little fellow down in and I own a Zulu
[1:09:17] Street see more he never experienced the
[1:09:23] power but he knew it was something there
[1:09:27] it's almost like Christopher Columbus I
[1:09:29] I know there's land there I've never
[1:09:31] seen it but I know it's there you know
[1:09:33] and you and I this is the way I feel I
[1:09:34] know this is revival usually the revival
[1:09:37] is over well maybe for the whole world
[1:09:40] I'm talking about this little group
[1:09:42] right here we need a revival I need one
[1:09:47] you know I need God to remove every bit
[1:09:51] of trash out of my life Oh
[1:09:55] tell me y'all must not have any but all
[1:09:58] I know is I need I need the extra power
[1:10:00] I need the extra strength to press
[1:10:02] through this darkness that we're living
[1:10:04] in oh my god but Samuel whenever you get
[1:10:09] to the place II just saw he says
[1:10:14] and that's how they do it they always
[1:10:17] use the profit to to make them look good
[1:10:21] now everybody in this message every
[1:10:24] preaching this message would have never
[1:10:26] been anything without the messenger
[1:10:29] it was his gospel it was God's gospel
[1:10:32] through him that gave us understanding
[1:10:35] of this word but we must always lean
[1:10:39] more to the spirit than we do to the arm
[1:10:42] of the flesh he even says it how he
[1:10:49] waited on God many times and there were
[1:10:52] times he did not wait on God because of
[1:10:54] the pressure of the people I think that
[1:10:57] was Africa when he had caught that niba
[1:11:00] because they wanted the preachers wanted
[1:11:02] him to go one way in the angel the Lord
[1:11:04] told him to go the other see it's so
[1:11:06] easy to do people it's so easy to be
[1:11:10] confused by people and people always
[1:11:12] mess you up nothing wrong with opinions
[1:11:16] but when you pressure a person to do
[1:11:18] something then that's not quite right
[1:11:21] but anyway let's move on you see because
[1:11:25] that's what Samuel Samuel if he had only
[1:11:27] waited for me excuse me I keep saying
[1:11:30] Sammy but I mean Saul if Saul could have
[1:11:32] only waited for the return of Samuel he
[1:11:35] would have been ok but it was the people
[1:11:38] all come on we didn't made this great
[1:11:40] conquer and you know uh uh in order to
[1:11:44] please God we got to give him the best
[1:11:46] the best of the chief or the best of the
[1:11:49] goat invest of this no but the Word of
[1:11:52] God say slay it all kill every animal
[1:11:55] kill the King of Thieves children killed
[1:11:57] everything but because of the pressure
[1:12:01] the people they didn't so let me say it
[1:12:04] like it
[1:12:05] brother I'm saying if you don't destroy
[1:12:09] the demon the demon will destroy
[1:12:14] and so Sam you knew that you got to kill
[1:12:18] the king
[1:12:19] where did the King demon is he's got to
[1:12:21] die right and when he came back Samuel
[1:12:25] came back to Saul says oh you said
[1:12:27] you've done all you supposed to do but
[1:12:29] what is the bleeding what is all the
[1:12:31] sound I hear in the back right so I want
[1:12:34] you to understand it doesn't matter how
[1:12:37] much you say I'm sanctified I'm clean I
[1:12:39] filled with the Holy Ghost if there's
[1:12:40] demons in your life it will produce a
[1:12:43] noise
[1:12:45] people don't recognize that there's
[1:12:48] something that's going on and I'm
[1:12:51] hearing it or I'm seeing it it's not
[1:12:53] dead yet that's the message the message
[1:12:58] is a it's the sword of God to kill
[1:13:01] everything to conquer all of the land
[1:13:05] the chemical every demon this is what
[1:13:08] the message is for that's why God gave
[1:13:10] the Prophet the King's sword and where
[1:13:13] did the Kings sword go is now in the
[1:13:15] hands or in the mouths of the bride we
[1:13:18] have it there's no reason why we cannot
[1:13:21] conquer this flesh and all of the things
[1:13:24] that the flesh produced we are here to
[1:13:26] conquer it and God is expecting us to
[1:13:28] conquer it hallelujah every preacher
[1:13:33] many preachers have made themselves
[1:13:35] filthy rich over this message but
[1:13:38] they're allowing the enemy to come into
[1:13:41] camp sisters are not dressing the way
[1:13:46] they should you say dress don't make it
[1:13:49] a different yes it does
[1:13:50] the Holy Ghost will make you dress right
[1:13:53] right brothers doing what they doing
[1:13:57] worldly things
[1:13:59] I wonder right now what people are doing
[1:14:02] now there's more importance in church
[1:14:05] somehow it seems like the right eyes
[1:14:08] don't people don't feel God they don't
[1:14:12] love him we preach this gospel so sweet
[1:14:17] and we left out the bitter and remember
[1:14:21] when John ate the scroll it was bitter
[1:14:23] antsy
[1:14:25] and that bitter pot is you got to do
[1:14:27] right you got to live right you got to
[1:14:30] stop dressing like the world acting like
[1:14:32] the world hanging with the world a true
[1:14:35] Christian want to be around Christian
[1:14:38] people they want to be around Christians
[1:14:40] amen who's got a life and not alive we
[1:14:47] build this you find preachers who want
[1:14:54] to make her name and you know that's
[1:14:58] what Lucy was there in the time of Babel
[1:15:18] it wasn't in the beginning because
[1:15:21] that's what I wanted to make and it's
[1:15:25] amazing how God can change it around and
[1:15:30] he said to Abraham see it's God who
[1:15:36] makes you great not you who makes
[1:15:38] yourself great amen is God who lifts you
[1:15:42] up or God who brings you down but when
[1:15:45] God does it and he'll do it he says seek
[1:15:48] ye first the kingdom of God and His
[1:15:50] righteousness and all of these other
[1:15:52] things will be added but we're not here
[1:15:56] to be Canaan we're not here to make our
[1:15:58] said that's not the holy state I'm
[1:16:00] telling you there brother in New
[1:16:06] Testament you reach something I can't
[1:16:08] pronounce this day right now but what
[1:16:10] the Bible said that he loved when you
[1:16:19] come in and all of a sudden you gotta
[1:16:20] you gotta know want people know any
[1:16:24] focus on is us
[1:16:25] I love that that's why I love about
[1:16:28] Jesus it's us having preeminence or what
[1:16:35] hallelujah you understand me they
[1:16:38] no right to disbelief Sam you because
[1:16:40] Samuel was always prophesied the truth
[1:16:42] to them he told them what was truth but
[1:16:46] he said now if you just just lets all
[1:16:49] and all of you follow the leading of
[1:16:51] this spirit it's that the truth why do
[1:16:54] you tell them Sam you say listen not
[1:16:57] only will they make you yo yo yo yo yo
[1:16:59] your sons are warriors and everything
[1:17:02] but he couldn't make yo yo your
[1:17:04] daughter's hair meetings in and what
[1:17:07] they call it and and they gonna make
[1:17:09] your your your soldiers armor bearer I
[1:17:13] love the head because of that not what
[1:17:16] you see in the message you see the
[1:17:19] preacher walking and he got his
[1:17:20] armor-bearer
[1:17:21] carrying his Bibles and everything
[1:17:23] that's the modern-day armor bearer so if
[1:17:29] there's an armor bearer that must be a
[1:17:30] king somebody help me that's the Bible
[1:17:35] what is it's a system that people are
[1:17:38] falling into the bomb said he whom the
[1:17:41] Sun is set free is free indeed and where
[1:17:44] the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:17:45] Liberty when man began to lead the
[1:17:50] church it becomes religion versus
[1:17:55] salvation God has many religions many
[1:18:00] religions but God God is looking for
[1:18:03] those who have salvation listen he said
[1:18:06] and when you die it is and that's what
[1:18:09] Pedro is that oh I'm in the message
[1:18:10] because I look like I'm all right but
[1:18:12] the Pharisees dress right they did you
[1:18:16] couldn't put a thing on their lives
[1:18:18] nothing about them was sexy everything
[1:18:21] look holy but the Bible tells me that
[1:18:24] the Pharisees were dead inside and
[1:18:27] that's what happens you see that all
[1:18:30] over Christians but they're dead inside
[1:18:33] no joy no peace but full of lust his
[1:18:40] only change is listen and a lot of time
[1:18:43] people will have I died the message when
[1:18:44] you die in the message meaning that
[1:18:46] you've got and you've been sealed with
[1:18:47] the Holy Ghost that's how you die in the
[1:18:49] message you don't die in the message
[1:18:52] she went to a message Church hallelujah
[1:18:55] you're not even to believe it because
[1:18:56] you go to a message Church hallelujah
[1:19:01] because a pig stop eating slop doesn't
[1:19:04] stop him from being a pig the only thing
[1:19:07] that changes a pig has changed in nature
[1:19:10] be and when you die remember it doesn't
[1:19:16] change your spirit it only changes your
[1:19:19] dwelling place and whatever type of
[1:19:22] spirit you got in you that's the place
[1:19:25] it will in other words it's the place
[1:19:29] where you will go sin could never into
[1:19:32] heaven
[1:19:33] so you said oh brother looks it just
[1:19:35] says knowing the message remembering the
[1:19:38] message knowing who the messenger is you
[1:19:40] know and all of those things will that
[1:19:41] put me in heaven know the people
[1:19:44] followed Moses they know Moses law and
[1:19:46] everything else they talked with Moses
[1:19:48] can I say like this they even listen to
[1:19:50] a snake but it did not give them the
[1:19:53] holy go and you find out that when it
[1:19:58] comes to people they have a system I see
[1:20:00] it everywhere I hate it it just gets
[1:20:04] next to me when I see people when we so
[1:20:07] program with certain songs and but you
[1:20:10] know there's no jubilance in it there's
[1:20:13] no joy there's no satisfaction I say
[1:20:19] well the choir even when I was in school
[1:20:23] and enjoyed it but that's not what we we
[1:20:27] gotta connect with heaven somehow and I
[1:20:31] mean everybody from the pulpit to the
[1:20:33] back of the door we must and it is
[1:20:36] needful that we find a way to connect
[1:20:40] with heaven so that we can hear him
[1:20:42] speak to us clearly that's what we need
[1:20:46] that's what the best is provided I just
[1:20:49] believe that brother Branham was telling
[1:20:51] us all these stories about talking to
[1:20:52] God so that we can see that we can talk
[1:20:54] to win is it that right if we have been
[1:20:58] the seals have been opened right and
[1:21:02] breslin's that it places us back into
[1:21:05] the place of Eid
[1:21:06] before the phone did not Adam and Eve
[1:21:07] talked to God they talked to him they
[1:21:12] knew him he wasn't some mystical thing
[1:21:16] he was a person he spoke back with them
[1:21:19] and that's the relationship we must have
[1:21:22] I don't know what people want to give it
[1:21:24] all to the Prophet when he was just the
[1:21:26] first wave of what was supposed to come
[1:21:29] I don't know what you're thirsting for
[1:21:32] but I thirst for that kind of
[1:21:35] relationship with God not every now and
[1:21:37] again every day I'm a come on stop in
[1:21:44] just a minute
[1:21:46] the Holy Ghost is the leader in the
[1:21:50] rejected King but never said but then
[1:21:53] when Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no
[1:21:55] more Sam you turn right away from him
[1:21:58] remember is that right when you know
[1:22:00] wait on God's Holy Spirit turn you said
[1:22:03] not in our day again see time
[1:22:05] remember when brother Branham got a head
[1:22:07] of the Holy Spirit and it came to that
[1:22:09] young boy baby boy are being healed and
[1:22:13] they had had to be in the way the
[1:22:16] mother-in-law had to come in and just
[1:22:18] one had to come in and everything but he
[1:22:19] got ahead of them and said I pronounce
[1:22:21] healing and when he did the boy got
[1:22:23] sicker huh and then he said oh so bad I
[1:22:29] realized things were it was in the
[1:22:32] vision and I had to say Oh God forgive
[1:22:34] me don't let this child die
[1:22:35] I didn't mean to do it Lord I didn't
[1:22:37] mean to do it then God allowed him to
[1:22:40] learn is the teaching him right wait I
[1:22:46] don't care for take an hour for that hat
[1:22:49] to move wait everything must be
[1:22:52] according to the vision way hallelujah
[1:22:56] and then when everything got according
[1:22:58] to the vision he went to the husband and
[1:23:00] wife oh oh I'm so sorry this is what
[1:23:03] happened this is what happened but now
[1:23:04] everything's in place and he talks about
[1:23:08] dust at the Lord three days you know
[1:23:10] y'all know what I'm trying to say I
[1:23:12] don't have any my notice inspired but I
[1:23:14] want you to understand that you and I
[1:23:16] were the same way God must teach us
[1:23:19] how so here is voice to listen and to
[1:23:22] win that's really not to your own
[1:23:26] understanding and knowledge him in all
[1:23:28] your ways and he shall direct your path
[1:23:29] that's it
[1:23:31] Amen I'm almost done folks with this
[1:23:34] portion but the first time this all took
[1:23:38] upon himself to take over the service of
[1:23:40] the Lord Sam your turn is back on him
[1:23:43] and walked away from him and the first
[1:23:46] time that the church let their leaders
[1:23:49] take over to lead the people the Holy
[1:23:52] Spirit gets a right away from them and
[1:23:55] the very first time that you go being
[1:23:58] led by man instead of God the Holy
[1:24:01] Spirit would get away from you to let
[1:24:04] the Holy Spirit lead that's what we need
[1:24:07] is leadership and God gave us a leader
[1:24:10] and we don't hear
[1:24:21] is that Alright in there same as that
[1:24:24] you gotta go listen to it they just I
[1:24:26] just can't believe some of the things I
[1:24:28] was listening to I went looking for
[1:24:30] nothing
[1:24:30] I just Lord led me to it and when he led
[1:24:33] me to it oh my god
[1:24:35] I think I told some of the brothers how
[1:24:37] this it's just you know because I've
[1:24:41] seen a system a long time now
[1:24:44] it's the thing that I I always hated and
[1:24:48] I'm saying yeah we're in the message but
[1:24:50] you know I've gone places and you know
[1:24:53] you have to sit some time like Methodist
[1:24:56] you came out when you're gonna shout you
[1:24:59] know I've gone to places you know it you
[1:25:02] know they hate I had a brother
[1:25:03] approached me about my tambourine I'm
[1:25:04] like no I don't care what you say about
[1:25:07] but every the vision I saw I said I was
[1:25:11] even in heaven playing the tambourine so
[1:25:12] you're not taking about you don't like
[1:25:16] my beats I play under the inspiration of
[1:25:19] God that's what I do
[1:25:21] so you love the Lord see let me go and
[1:25:27] close on this I say that let me give me
[1:25:31] give me at least two more minutes
[1:25:32] there is many fine churches in the world
[1:25:34] today but there is one miss Jesus that's
[1:25:38] bringing forth the real truth born again
[1:25:40] create creators creatures of God you
[1:25:44] know what I mean you don't don't you her
[1:25:47] name is not Methodist her name is not
[1:25:50] Baptist her name is Jesus miss Jesus
[1:25:53] sure she is she is bringing forth people
[1:25:57] not members of the Methodist Church
[1:25:58] she's not bringing forth a Baptist
[1:26:01] Church a Presbyterian or Catholic she is
[1:26:03] bringing forth then born and rooted and
[1:26:07] grounded in Christ Jesus there she is
[1:26:11] that's her I'm so glad that I'm with her
[1:26:15] she's a mystical Church she don't have
[1:26:18] any denomination she carries none of
[1:26:20] these great big fancy names and big
[1:26:23] buildings she meets whosoever the
[1:26:29] members of the body gathered together
[1:26:31] they worship in spirit and in truth they
[1:26:34] were
[1:26:35] predestinated before the foundation the
[1:26:37] law in other words I'm trying to say
[1:26:39] this if you are Miss Jesus you can't
[1:26:41] help but to act like your predestinated
[1:26:44] you can't stop the joy that God that
[1:26:48] comes with your predestination you can't
[1:26:50] stop the peace you can't stop the love
[1:26:52] you can't stop all these great things
[1:26:54] that come with you being elected and
[1:26:57] chosen of God you can and don't let
[1:27:00] nobody else stop you no don't let them
[1:27:04] stop you people God is expecting us to
[1:27:07] hold the standard right you will one out
[1:27:10] of a million right and I just believe
[1:27:13] that there is something that God wants
[1:27:15] us to do here and I keep praying god
[1:27:17] help me no matter what if there's
[1:27:19] something I'm doing wrong whatever it
[1:27:21] may be
[1:27:21] deliver me give me strength place me in
[1:27:24] that place I'm not trying to be nothing
[1:27:27] but other than what I'm called to be and
[1:27:29] that's a part of the bride that's all
[1:27:32] I can't help I'm different I feel like
[1:27:35] it all the time I feel you know like I'm
[1:27:37] just I'm just different from everybody
[1:27:42] you know I I'm so glad this tone of ours
[1:27:48] I hate that people are dining it sick
[1:27:50] but it's giving me space to see his face
[1:27:53] to thinking
[1:27:54] faces you know reminisce and go through
[1:27:56] all that I've gone through it I've been
[1:27:58] saved and how many gears are Christian
[1:28:00] how many years and I've seen the
[1:28:02] supernatural seen all of that people but
[1:28:04] there's something that's not quite I'm
[1:28:08] not I know the best is happy I'm not
[1:28:11] looking for another message I know what
[1:28:14] I have is perfection but I want to see
[1:28:16] the perfection also changing living in
[1:28:20] that's what I want I know it's there
[1:28:22] Ryan you gotta search you gotta look
[1:28:25] together it's got to be quick and gooey
[1:28:27] because now it doesn't this is that
[1:28:28] internet it's God's doing it and I think
[1:28:32] if God it's like it's like a you know
[1:28:34] the three wise men they they knew
[1:28:36] something was behind that stop and they
[1:28:40] had to travel can you imagine how long
[1:28:42] and how far they traveled to get there
[1:28:45] from the time of that appearing of the
[1:28:47] star I think it took
[1:28:48] two and a half three years almost to get
[1:28:50] there how many of us was in constant
[1:28:52] like that in prayer just in prayer I'm
[1:28:57] going to stay there till I get to see
[1:28:58] the Messiah of this stop okay it's so
[1:29:07] much I want to say but anyway there
[1:29:12] brother madam goes on to say you know
[1:29:14] people who refuses the Holy Ghost they
[1:29:18] don't want to be judged and I don't know
[1:29:21] whether you noticed it but you can
[1:29:24] preach all these great mysteries and the
[1:29:27] people of shower when we start getting
[1:29:29] into their life and all the filth and
[1:29:32] things that they're doing they don't
[1:29:33] like and they don't they don't they'll
[1:29:36] call you second pool they call you you
[1:29:38] know not deep enough and they don't even
[1:29:40] know us the whole ego trying to dig and
[1:29:43] then cut into him amen to call some
[1:29:46] attention so you know conviction and
[1:29:48] instead they go out with that critical
[1:29:50] spirit and they don't even realize that
[1:29:52] that that critical spirit has been given
[1:29:55] to him because they have rejected the
[1:29:58] Holy Spirit when Saul rejected the Word
[1:30:05] of God the evil spirit if you reject the
[1:30:09] Samuel when he whipped Samuel Hahnemann
[1:30:11] and you said the kingdom that he wasn't
[1:30:16] lost but God gave him the bad spirit and
[1:30:20] then you look all over the messages you
[1:30:22] can go with bad you know may God help we
[1:30:29] need the full manifestation
[1:30:39] I'm not gonna stop until I see visibly
[1:30:43] see the work of God in me like that
[1:30:48] Pilate said I know because I believe
[1:30:52] that the bride is supposed to be a woman
[1:30:55] he is so tied up and tangling up into
[1:30:57] the Word of God
[1:30:58] there'll be no spot amen you love Lord
[1:31:05] that's tan
[1:31:13] pictures and photographs
