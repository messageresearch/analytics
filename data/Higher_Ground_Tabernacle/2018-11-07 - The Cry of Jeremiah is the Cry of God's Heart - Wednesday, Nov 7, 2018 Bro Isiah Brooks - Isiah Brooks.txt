gonna get right into the Word of God God is so good to us hallelujah he's worthy to be praised how great is our God if we could just only remember that all the time amen it's a wonderful song to hold on your heart because God is great and greatly to be praised amen Psalm 17 please thank you brother hallelujah Psalm 17 we read the 8th verse then we go to Psalms 19 and 7 Psalms 17 and 8 and in Psalms 19 and 7 and we don't declare his name who will I am so grateful that God has appointed and anointed me by God's grace to proclaim the truth in this day and hour somebody's got to do it 17 and 8 oh he says keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings Psalms 19 we need to prayed these kinds of prayers because people of God if God don't have mercy on people like the scripture says if he doesn't shorten a time no flesh will be saying Psalms 19 and 7 the law of the Lord is perfect concerning our converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statue the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgment of the Lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold yay then much fine gold sweeter also than the honey and the co honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant worn and it's in keeping of them there is great reward appreciate the Lord and His grace amen what what will we do without him thinking about how he has given us so much grace you know we we can only say even to this day is still amazing on what God has done for us and he is doing for us let us pray father we come before your Lord Jesus as humble as we know how and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves cleanse us from all unrighteousness help us now Lord Jesus that will be what you would have us to be in these last and evil days in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated by God's grace I have been just reading a lot in Jeremiah has just been so amazed at that particular book and Jeremiah just enlightened us on how Israel was and it's amazed because history always repeats itself we as Christians sometimes fail to see that what God is doing in our days and songs of Solomon Solomon said there is no new thing under the Sun Ecclesiastes and all tells us that the greatest wisdom that a man can have is to fear God and keep his Commandments we thank God for his knowledge and understanding we often time talk about the intellectual way of looking at things and we don't need just knowledge as a man would teach but we need the knowledge that only God can reveal see because a man could teach you about being born again even God taught Jesus and Nicodemus I mean Jesus taught Nicodemus and told him you must be born again and he told him you must be born of the water and of the spirit but that was knowledge I was understanding to the man who could understand it and even Jesus said Nicodemus no it's not like you go back into your mother's womb but that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit I like to entitle my message tonight the cry of Jeremiah is the cry of God's heart often time we don't understand preaching we hear people preach but we don't understand what that is God is a spirit and they that worship God and must worship Him in spirit and in truth the Bible tells us that no man have seen God at any time except the Sun and to whom he reveals you and I must understand that God chose preaching as foolishness it's foolishness of preaching is where God unveils himself often time people don't understand that preaching is just not a man with an occupation but it is a calling it is a divine calling of God where he stands in representative of the invisible God the God that cannot be seen and sometimes people take those things lightly because they see a man and they don't see God but those who are spiritual they can see God when other people see a man take for example the woman who Sarah decent woman when she saw Elijah she watched his mannerism she watched his character and to someone else he was just a man but to her she was more than a man because the knowledge of God was revealed to her that this man is special he is a god man and she even asked her husband to build a room because this man has God walking in and with him and because a man she was the revelation came to her she was rewarded a with that revelation she was rewarded so you got to understand God can do so many great things in such a simple way that if the people are not careful in a path right through them and they won't even know it when we come to God we must understand that God has feelings he's a man yet he's God he's God and yet he's a man because God made himself a man he once was a spirit only but now he is a man he men and the Bible tells us that the fullness of the Godhead bodily drew out in him now I understand that when God began to talk with his people see God had already talked with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden told him the things they should do and what they shouldn't do but at that time we realize a man that our God had the only voice but then here comes the serpent and he had a voice and his voice is the thing that caused discrepancy his voice is the thing that caused confusion his voice is the thing that caused death as long as they listen to the voice of God they lived as long as you listen to the voice of God you will live but it seems like man has a way or a tendency of trying to establish their own salvation we have a tendency to do that because even after Adam and Eve failed they tried to you know produce their own religion what we call the fig leaf religion and it didn't work with God that was their intelligence I'll put it this way it was the Serpent's intelligence because it was a serpent who told them that they were naked amen so being naked they tried to clothe themselves with their own knowledge but that knowledge was fallen now there was a time that I had a new got what God would required but because of the fall and the breach he didn't know so he didn't look guessing and got a fig leaf and covered himself and God told him that won't work so we find out by God's grace that God continues and God supplied them with lamb skin and covered their bodies and everything else and you know how the story is men began to multiply and a small man began to multiply so did unbelief and unbelief is sin right so they move out of the presence of God now watch this now because God gives Cain the knowledge he gives them instructions to do but it wasn't quickened to him see knowledge or let's put it this way God has to quicken his word to you in order for you to understand what he's saying because he said my word is spirit it is truth it is life and so when God can say one thing and and people can get all kinds of revelations from it but when God gives a revelation of what he's saying to the believer because the believer will hear it the believer will see it they will understand it and then they will follow through with it amen because remember God gave to Ava the revelation of the sacrifice he had no book to read that was nothing he could read but God even if his parents told him the truth don't you understand if you got Christians Christian parents that don't mean you understand what they're talking about it takes a personal revelation from God for you to understand what it is to be born again when it comes to crying out I looked it up and a lot of you know we looked at the scriptures because Isaiah 58 and one says cry aloud and spare not lift up that voice like a trumpet and show that people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sins now when we talk about crying out loud you and I must understand that Isaiah was a prophet and the word of the Lord comes by way of the Prophet in other words God takes a man who has been designed to hear his voice and echo out what he's saying right so crying loud it wasn't just shouting it was feelings in there there was emotions in there it means they meant that when God cries out there's a lamentation of some sort going on there's grief in that voice there's suffering in that voice right and sometimes those prophets would even cry because they could feel the pain of God when it came to his people you see a lot of times people think that they could just do whatever they want to and it's not affecting God that's for an example if you had children and your children would do something to go wayward him and you feel the pain so is it with God when every one of his children go away with he feared the pain because he knows that that way is the wrong way and he knows that destruction is at the end of that day so when you see a preacher when he gets so emotional sometimes he screams sometimes he he looked like he's angry he's not expressing his feelings he's expressing God's feelings he's crying out trying to get the people to hear the voice of God so when God told Isaiah cry aloud and spare not in other words I don't want you to implement or put your own feelings into it I want you to just cry out like I feel what I feel unite with me now because I want these people to see how much I care and how much I love them that's why I cry oh God keep me as the apple of your eye lord please by your grace of God preserve me I want to be a real Christian a true Christian I want to be order and obedience son how long with God continue to cry understand there is a period in which God will cry God will beg you almost God will plead with you is that right the Bible says even the New Testament compel them to come do whatever you can do to come to make them come to this gospel why because God knows that there's only one life and that's his life right amen so we realize by God's grace amen there's coming a time when the preaching stops when God no longer cry out when God comes to the place he's finished dealing with you we call that crossing the line and that day at the North had preached 120 years to people all those people and you know God deals with you one by one if there were two to millions of million people in that day God went to each each individual pleading begging a hundred and twenty years of suffering God God did not want to sin the Bible said it repented him because he saw what man had become without the wild the preaching stops and when the preaching stopped if you haven't repented you shut out there's a time jeremiah cried out to the people God told him says listen they're in bad shape you're not going to get one convert out of this I want you to preach it like everybody can hear it everybody can come but know this truth Jeremiah they are so hard in their heart against me even so God says what have I done what is it that I've done have I not kept my word with you have I not taken care of you have a not been a friend have I not been a deliverer have I not been your Savior I've been everything you want me to do now why do you find fault in me that was the way God was crying out out the wild the voice of the Prophet ceases and God moves on because God said I'll never leave myself without a witness in the message divine healing brother Branham tells us he that sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for saying Hebrews K and I believe he said is that right he said that sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a fearful looking for the fire to the judgment and firing England a ssin which shall devour the adversaries now he that he that what willfully is he that sins and what is sin unbelief he that will turn his back on the truth when it's presented to him there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin did you ever read it that see like that he that disbelieved wilfully out the truth has been presented to him because his church believes different that's when you cry the line he that sin willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth normal sacrifice a lot of people don't know that they hear the message and they said oh but brother Branham you know he ain't the only one they have all kinds of excuses Amen to do the sin they won't to do and they know that what's being said is right but they choose to do something else you know if people understood that in the light that it really is in it would bring a godly fear upon them jeremiah i'ma show him I read a script when Jeremiah how it really was you see because Jeremiah the people out the wild start crying out to God and God wouldn't hear them oh my god you don't want to be in a condition that you decide to repent too late the days of Noah they repented too late you don't want to be there because God will not hear you Jeremiah mridu 14 17 for 12 Oh Lord though our iniquities testify against us do the whole it for thy name's sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee o the hope of Israel the savior thereof in time of trouble why shouldn't I be as a stranger in the land and as a welfare man that turned it aside to tarry for a night why should it not be as a man as strong as a mighty man that cannot say yet now O Lord are in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not see they crying out to God thus said the Lord until his people and that's the way it is we treat God like a stranger coming in for a night anytime you want a blessing from God you'll cry out to God for that time but then once God give you the blessed you go on to do what you want to do you treat him like he's some kind of senticles gift and then we fail to see that God has feelings thus said the Lord unto his people that's how they love to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the Lord does not accept them he will now remember their iniquities and visit their sins then said the Lord are to be prey not for this people for their good when they fast I will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and an ablation I will not accept them but I will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence that's jeremiah 14 14 seven through 12 he says listen I'm not I'm not going to just listen to them anymore I pleaded with him I called to them I preachers behind I said the fivefold by you know that's what I'm telling you I'm telling you God is speaking to message people because they have taken on the same attitude that the people did in Jeremiah's day brother BAM said this message did not come to shake the world it came to shake the church this message did not come to shake the world it came to shake the church God has feelings the Bible tells us John I'm coming as a man even goes on and said Jesus wept and that's all look how he must have loved but they fail to see there was more to it one thing about God he knows unbelief and the atmosphere was full of unbelief when a preachers preaching and he's connected with God he can seal unbelief no matter how much he's preaching how much truth he's preaching he still knows the spirit of unbelief when there is no up when there's unbelief even the Word of God bounces off the people but when there's faith they become like a sponge then said the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself coming to the grave it was a cave and a stone laid upon it and jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto Him Lord by this time he's stinking but he has been dead for days and jesus said unto her said I not unto thee you understand me here God in flesh they had seen all kinds of miracles and even at that moment she doubted Lord this man has been dead you instructing God as if he didn't know sometimes we do that we go back at God and still God don't know your situation God knows when it began God's gonna know he knows when it's ending he knows the in-betweens and we talk to God like he don't even know what's going on that's exactly what Mary and then we'll do it take away the stole Martha the sister him that was dead said unto Him Lord die this time he's thinking for he had been dead for four days as if he didn't know Martha did Jesus said in her said I not unto thee in other word did not I tell you don't question my authority just do it don't question my word just do it said I not unto thee that if thou would have believed thou should have see the glory of God then they took away the stone from the place two women that huge stone how did they do it God had to take the same faith that he raised Lazarus with and he gave it to them because two women could not have moved that stone it was a huge stone it was a heavy stone take the stone away then they took away the stone from the place where he did the Dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou here with me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they might believe that thou has sitting me and we had thus has spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with the napkin jesus said unto them loose him and let him go you hear what I'm saying he's dealing with the atmosphere charged with unbelief even Mary and Martha full of unbelief Lord this situation I've been here for a long time God don't care about your situation like that God wants you to know that he can change it God wants you to know he can fix it I always tell people that say understand it breaks God heart I could say like this when he find his own disbelieving him he even went Peterman was on the boat and they crying out Lord karat doubt not that we perish don't you understand he's your father he's your friend he's your daddy and when you we question God or whether he cares or not oh Jesus the cry of Jeremiah was to cry of God's heart I don't know exactly how many he is Jeremiah preached but all that he could tell them was this if you don't repent the Babylonians coming God is already raised up of people because you wouldn't repent the next thing you got is my judgment and it doesn't matter the people in this message even though they said when we got Amen like they did in Jesus day Abraham is our Father he said but if you had known Abraham you would have known me my thought you would have done the things that Abraham told you to do and then we say we believe this message Amen there was preached by the Prophet William Branham we will do what he said see because it's not the voice a William Branham it's the voice of God flowing through William Branham Jeremiah God had to really give him confidence he had to really put something in Jeremiah because Jeremiah didn't want to do the job a true servant never wants to really do the job but he told Jeremiah he said listen before I formed thee in thy belly I knew thee and before that came forth out of your mother's womb I sanctified thee and how I be a prophet unto it unto the nation don't you understand if God has made us priests and kings before we were formed in our mother's womb that's what we were thank God sanctified us even dear Oh Lord I cannot speak I don't care about you in that sense we all give excuses Oh Lord I can't do this I can't do that God said but I called you yes but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child but thou shalt go to all that I have Cindy and whatsoever I commanded thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the LORD even then people would not have their faces when the preacher preached when they know like the word they did not it up but God said don't be afraid of that faces like I said many people don't even know that God behind bad to skin when he's preaching they think Jeremiah is annoyed all the reason why he is because God has told him all hey man he then Jeremiah judging the people is God through Jeremiah that's judging the people hmm we break his heart we break God's heart if I could say like this we cause God to agree you say that's not Scripture it is the Bible said it repented God in the days of Noah that he even made man now that's that's bad that's real bad you think God was smiling when he said that no sir if a spirit could cry he cried I hope this is all right Jeremiah the very name of Jeremiah means exaltation of the Lord God to a praise of men nobody exalted God everybody'd exhausted all of it fees everything God gave them they will exalt it all kinds of gods look at this and look at that miss that they did all of that but they nobody wanted to exalt God you don't hear God people in the street saying praise the Lord God bless you all those things will be used you don't hear it even among the message you came highly find the joy in the camp fire because you failed to praise Him the Bible says Amen that that God inhabits the praise of the people but we've got my shame just like Israel we look at the world like they're the ones prospering yes they're prospering but they're on their way to hell which one you rather have going to heaven are going to hell and somehow people don't they think God don't you understand this is the last go-round there's a lot coming another chance and the Gentile days are numbered one of these old days that door would be shot and the prophet of God said the preachers will be preaching still like people can be saved it won't be possible today when you hear his voice harden not your heart according to the Jewish tradition Jeremiah that he was the author of the Book of Jeremiah and the Book of Kings in the Book of Lamentations amen so you understand that Eve Eve was that book of limitation God weeping crying warning telling the people about all the judgment and we can tell them don't you know California's gonna drop oh yeah we know but nobody's preparing to escape all we can tell them hey man don't you know there's a bomb coming our way don't y'all know that brother Branham said there is a bomb that's gonna drop but the bride will be going but we say oh well we bride bride is not just a figure of speech it is a life it is a life the life of Christ in you is what make you bride not because you say I'm immensities or Baptist or Presbyterian or Catholic that means nothing with God when I see the blood I'll pass over you you gotta believe you gotta believe God that God can change you if God can't change you it's because you won't allow him to God works by faith without faith it's impossible to please him before you can ever become a perfect man you must believe that God could make you a perfect man and you keep looking at this flesh and everything and think God's gonna perfect this flesh he ain't workin on the flesh he's workin on the soul of a man it is that inward man that God is working on [Music] that the work that he's begun in me he shall complete it I cannot do it he's the one hallelujah but I will never give up on God because God will never give up on me Jeremiah 32 27 then said then came the word of the Lord and the jeremiah said behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh is there anything too hard for me he was pleading with the people trying to get that dead state Israel was terrible but so all the people in this day we can easily say Israel was bad but what are we doing well what are we doing we prostituting God's time we were doing everything but worshiping God and when I say we I'm talking about as a whole maybe some of us are not doing it some of us are probably diligent but my party is what will happen to us and God doesn't become your real lover if God doesn't become the center of your life what is gonna happen to you hallelujah the way we were now remember how you were when God first Savior how it was so sweet and so lovely and so kind so good Jeremiah says go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus said the Lord I remember thee the - of the youth the love of dying espousal when thou witnessed after me in the wilderness and in the land that was not song Israel was holiness unto the Lord and the first fruit of his increase oh that devoured him shall offend evil shall come upon them saith the Lord y'all remember that you remember the time he was so close to God that when somebody did you wrong you didn't have to do nothing God took care of it you didn't even have to say anything mean to them God will always come to your rescue I remember the days and my thing is amid those same days can be redeemed there was such a love affair it's like when sounds of shadow let me kiss let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth don't you know if God don't kiss you you're none of his the Bible said kiss the son lest she be angry and that kiss is a covenant hallelujah cuz God only kisses his bride let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for that love is better than wine because of the Saviour of my good augment that name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the Virgin's love thee draw me we will run after thee the King had brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember that love more than wine the upright love V y'all know what I'm saying we felt that in prayer y'all know that when he would come near we would run after him no don't leave me hallelujah then all of a sudden his present would come amen we can just pray pray pray pray pray we just enjoyed it better than wine hallelujah when God would come into our own private prayer how good it was hallelujah that's the way we were and that's the way we should be nice but many become prostitutes claiming to be virgins prostitute as the prophet of God said don't mean sexually every time you can prostitute your time you can prostitute your faith go out and join some cult or some oh so cold former church your prostitute you are you're just as guilty as she was but the same Lord that forgave her has the same pleading mercy for you tonight see God can forgive you when you put all these other things in front of him that's prostitution you're not a virgin in your spirit you're giving all your time to everything else for God God don't like it is that all right Matthew 28 25 32 or 36 woe unto the scribes and the Pharisees hypocrites for you make the clean micki make clean the outside of the cup of the planner but within they are full of extortion sin excess now blind Pharisees clears first that which is written within the cup and plate and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto the white Sepulchre which indeed appear beautiful outward but we are but are within full of dead men's bones you know of all uncleanness where where you talk about that ain't about that's among what we call the bride nothing change Jesus came to a church that look look perfect pure everybody it meant who was a Pharisee said they dressed properly they looked probably they came to church properly and Jesus said but you nasty you're unclean you look good outside he said but had I not come you would have had a cloak volunteers you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you build the tomb of the prophets and garnish the supplicants of the righteous and that's not what they did everybody head down to Jeffersonville they Wallis garnishing this and that and making holy days and holy places and all these things and there's only one holy place and that's you if you got the Holy Ghost though I said we've been in the days of our fathers we will not have been taken with them in the blood of the prophets huh wherefore ye witnesses unto yourself that ye are the children of them which kill the prophets fill ye up the measures of your fathers ye serpents you generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell wherefore behold I send it to you the prophets and wise men describes and some of them you have killed and crucified and some of them you shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city hello that's way we do preachers we treat them just like that and we fail to see the god behind that bad just kid don't you know how you treat your pastor is how you treat God you cannot get away from it jesus said you came him lovely without even learn your brother he said you see him all the time you don't see well for behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you should kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in those synagogues and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous near all the righteous blood shed upon the earth you say well no I want you to understand the Bible said all the blood that the Catholic Church was guilty of all huh and guess what when you crucify or youuuu handle Amen a man of God in the wrong way you're guilty or I could say something cuz some of y'all might not understand it but I say it anyway cuz he told me saying Amen brother BAM said our past is like a God to you I'm not God but the word that comes from me o Jerusalem Jerusalem see we can always go back and say this is what Israel do how good is gonna do it how could they do that how can go in the wilderness how could they have Moses how can I see the pillar fire how can they see the pillar of cloud and see God divide to see open like that there's still time to sin we're doing it now getting no better and we're doing it now let's put it this way how can you and I do it Oh Jerusalem Jerusalem bout that killed the prophets stone at them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together even as then gather her chickens and under her wings and he would not you know what he said I've tried to gather you I've tried to be a good guard I tried to be and every time I thought I had you move on out the way isn't that the way we do it oh god I want to be closer to you and as soon as God tried to bring himself closer we move out of the way why because we won't soft moving we won't easy living God draws you closer to him by way of trials hmm you go get trials and tribulation you gonna fight that right he said if any man follow me to let him take up his cross that's how you follow Christ by taking up your cross whatever he brings so be it lord I take it and I gotta suffer to know you is that right Paul said it I want to know the Lord hallelujah amen not only in the powerless reverential but I want to know him in his suffering o daru-salam Jerusalem now they killed the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often I would have gathered that children together even as he is gathered her chickens under the wings he would not behold your house is left unto you desolate but I say unto you you shall not see me henceforth till you say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord did it happen 2,000 years ago Israel was on the top of the lap of I could say like that before Jesus came Israel was great but look what happened see see it all even even when when they were let loose from Babylon you think they would have left all that stuff 70 years in slavery with Babylon because God cursed them spanked them let's put it away put it put the rod to them because of their disobedience one of the things that they were disobedient in because God told them to let the land rest seven years all right every Sabbath every seventh year let the land rest and they would not do it because they were into their businesses and God said okay I'm a multiply your sorrow 7 times 10 is 7 and you're gonna stay in Babylon seventy years let the land rest when the land is healed I bring you back and all of them didn't want to go either and when they did come guess what they brought with them denominationalism and that's exactly what the message people have done instead of coming out of organization and out denominationalism and being free led by the Holy Spirit we denominated ourselves oh oh we're not an organization well you got the spirit of it hallelujah is this okay what is it people people gotta understand amen you and I must understand that God when you know God God God called Jeremiah you know the blushing prop he was one that literally cried a lot you know and he said brother BAM go says listen he says seeing the Prophet but the blood excuse me the blushing prophet of the Bible we blushed tonight I blush before you because of the sins of the people the people my nation my people have been the same of them out of being a shame of the Lord to see our young ladies walking in the street and act in the way they are to see the prostitution the young men living in all kinds of life see them staying home from church and reading old magazines they ought not to read looking at us as a program listening to the Hollywood City dirty jokes listen to our old wicked whoopies music another devil that hatches out from men that I hear faman got vile conscience the devil's influence to inspire the work of the devil on huh and we do all of this and say well you know I'm bright I'm justified that's what Israel say I'm gonna do all of this cuz he don't see us he's not aware of what all I'm doing God is aware hallelujah you say Oh God understands yeah the only thing God understand is his word God understands one thing and that's the blood that's all he understands he knows the blood he knows no color lines he knows no race line whether the man is black blue white brown or whatever color he is God knows nothing about that their sons and daughters he make them as his flower garden he likes to look at them the way they are and he says leave them be that way hallelujah but a lot of times people are Almighty you know how the world is even in the message you know people want to argue about whether Jesus was white or black or blue or whatever who cares oh I don't have people tell me yeah you know you know I'm gonna say it anyway you know we look at these people in people people look down because they are you black and skinned y'all they know that in this message what didn't you know that all the church age messengers were white that's a big argument but the point of the matter is so what if they were all white is that some credential there's the many white people in hell as it is black brown and whatever color more all that went down in those day in hell when who color they were y'all understand me your color don't give you some kind of edge on heaven jewel being a Jew doesn't make you believe me go put you to heaven cuz all Israel is not Israel and we look at things and we look at people people let me tell you something somebody said something to me the other day I want you to understand this I have always enjoyed who I was and I am I've never wanted our desire to be white and I hope and trust that a white man never desire to be black you ought to be happy about what God has made you I love the RAI your teeth myself you know we look at this thing it's Oh Lord have I'm a closing just a minute but I had to cry out because let me tell you something no prejudice period I don't care if it comes from the greatest man known in this message if your projects you will not make a rapture you got color skin color problems you were not gonna make it you're not gonna make it you follow this world up in this nonsense all you want to you know I was thinking about the other day if I get if I die because I'm black that ain't that's not gonna make me go to heaven Lord no they're not gonna make me go to hell what's gonna make me go to hell if I don't know Jesus if the blood of Jesus have not been replied God don't care about what color I am there is a provided way Isaiah 63 and says I will mention the loving kindness of the Lord and the praises of the Lord according to all that the Lord has restored upon us and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he had bestowed on them according to his mercy and according to the multitude of his loving-kindness hello I will make mention how ain't gonna keep quiet cuz you don't believe in God I am so sorry for you but I'm gonna steal testify I was at the bank today amen and I had a chance to witness to her arm nah he wasn't rushing what's one of the Bosnian yes Bosnian Muslim at that guess what he even said he might come to church he knows exactly where we are the man was a to me you understand me God open up a door I gave him my num and he said he's gonna call me I said brother we get together his brother has become a Christian and when he found out I was a passenger's just like something just God good to us folks I'm almost done but I'm crying out before the Lord for you for me so that we can understand by God's grace that we are now being judged is that right some people say well well that's what we that's what this house here for the Bible said judgment first first began at the house of God that all right so if I am here the judge is here and the judge is the one who's judging you not me he's the one that's making me say what I say he told Jeremiah don't be afraid of their faces say it anyway because I feel like with all my heart amen just like the brother the other day he want to know what he's got this ain't a time to wonder it's a time to make sure my your calling and election sure he said what brother ha I said I'm gonna tell you something there's a provided way brother Branham preached it over and over again God's provided way you want the Holy Ghost go listen to the tapes because on there he gives you instructions he said a baby don't know nothing but how to cry for what they want say you can give him a bell to ring and it won't work right cuz he's not been instructed he said that's God's provided way and I said I don't care what these intellectuals has made you do that's why we're not living it because we need a quickening in our soul we need God and then to go down into our soul not just on our flesh in our spirit we need a soul revival I can't do it for you just like nobody just like it is a will have come to a baby chick coming out of a chicken right a chicken a chicken a chicken what's called Chiklis woopi-hey coming up a right you can't help him if you happen he's gonna die he needs to pick his way out of that sale he need that energy he needs that strength his heart needs that strength and you need it I cannot let you do it but you got to get in there yourself and back your way out of this world keep all until you crack that she'll so something happens in you and then you can crawl out of this world into a new world I can't do it for you you need to do it for yourself but I'm gonna tell you something don't be stupid usually for using that word don't be deceived don't assume because this is the most evil age there is Satan is deceiving a lot of people there are many won't make a rafter because they thought they had the Holy Ghost that's the word of your prophet in time you need to change and all of us know we need a greater walk with God I'm not saying you don't have it but my point is that for those of you who are not having you you know you got it but you're not where you should be then you should press this is your chill cry bill me Lord shake me Lord Mobe law I don't care what I got to go through just like I said this the other day down in Iowa City I said I don't care what cause what cause I don't care what he's gonna do to bring me to that place of where he's satisfied with me so be it they look at me like you sure you want to say that I'm sure this is time this is for a woman James said is a vapor hallelujah but that's eternal life I trade this for that don't be deceived you know I must thank God is crying right now he's uh he's he's he's looking you said I don't believe that brother brother Bradley said he'd be if he said it may even be what ten that make me meet the rapture he said it might be just like on one hand where's that gonna put us up put us it's more than that in here and you sure I don't yes because the foolish modulus people who around this message I know people today I don't know where the other ones gonna appear I don't where were the good the ungodly in the same I don't know where they're gonna appear but these foolish virgins were cut from the same material that means same message one just didn't have the Holy Ghost and one did and they were virgins best damn may God help us may God hear our prayer know that we desire more of him know that our desires to be what he wants us to be no matter what helped us escape this wicked world or help will help us escape ourselves Jesus Christ you are my lord in God and I know one thing what if God turns its back on you doing nothing can be done Israel probably thought because oh we're chosen race you know Abraham is our Father they thought oh oh we got it we got it me and Jesus said you don't and because you think you got it made he said you're gonna die in your sins and they knew the word better than we know it from the intellectual standpoint and nothing wrong with that I'm saying we need the word we need this knowledge we need a men God's understanding we need that but at the end of the day we need to live it when all said and done we need to live it and you and I'm understanding man that only God can quicken it to you oh you said Oh God help me to love you my brother he's the only one that can help you love is not something you can put all and it's got to be real and only God can make it real that's the criteria of this message for this day and that is divine love let's not fake it folks let's not pretend like it's there when it's not it is just a time this is the time really really is this is the time to really cry out to God and he'll say God have mercy staying much prayer as you possibly can you don't have to always be on your knees but you need to be in prayer I'm talking about me too I pray all day all day I do I may not be on my knees but I'm constantly praying some time it's out loud sometimes it's not but I'm a constant prayer but I know by God's grace if I did not pray the way I pray no telling what would be come of me with all the temptations with all of the thoughts and everything that comes to my mind o people y'all pray for me and I'll pray for you because we need more God Lord we need you Jesus whatever you do lord have mercy on us let us be the apple of your eye let us constantly mention you Lord let us praise you whenever we can get a chance Lord let us not be ashamed of you Jesus most of all let us live this life this is what I cry out for the lost Lord let me live it nobody else want to if I got to be rejected and despised whatever the case may be Lord you know my I love you Lord we love you Lord this little group of people or they don't come out on a Wednesday night for fashion and for Moore's to show they come because they want to hear from you I believe Lord that you've given us a special group of people that's why Lord God I have to cry out the way I cry out Lord I do not but lord I do not oh god will come guilty of holding back the truth Lord regardless to the way is preached everywhere we know Lord we need more of you Lord we don't want to come short we don't want to prostitute your time we want to be virgins long you the only one could help us keep this covenant because no man can keep it but we need to keep her we need you help us
