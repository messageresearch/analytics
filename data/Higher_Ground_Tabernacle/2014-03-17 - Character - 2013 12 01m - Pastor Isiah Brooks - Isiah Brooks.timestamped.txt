[0:26] let's turn by the grace of God to St
[0:29] John 1

[0:33] scripture here by the grace of
[0:37] God and uh we trust that you're blessed
[0:40] here this
[0:42] morning uh I I didn't come uh uh to be
[0:48] seen of myself amen but if we could uh
[0:51] move back the flesh amen and and see the
[0:54] Lord Jesus here hallu this
[0:57] morning I Believe by the grace of God
[1:00] that we are in what we would call a
[1:03] transition amen God is uh is changing us
[1:08] from glory to
[1:10] glory and uh it is the Lord's doing amen
[1:15] because no man can add one cubic to his
[1:19] statue amen so we're going to ask that
[1:21] you read with us St John
[1:26] 114 St John 114
[1:33] and the Word was made
[1:36] flesh and dwelt among
[1:40] us and we beheld his
[1:43] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:48] of the
[1:49] father full of
[1:52] grace and
[1:54] truth is that all
[1:56] right we're going to ask with that you
[1:59] turn with us also to 2
[2:10] Corinthians I am so glad that these
[2:14] things that we trust to uh
[2:19] become has already been
[2:22] settled hallelu by
[2:25] God before the foundation of the world
[2:30] yeah we're not here to impress
[2:34] him we're just here to obey him
[2:38] amen 2 Corinthians 3 beginning at
[2:45] the 16th
[2:48] verse
[2:50] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[2:53] Lord the veil shall be taken
[2:57] away now the Lord is that
[3:00] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[3:04] is there is
[3:07] Liberty but we all with open face
[3:11] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[3:17] Lord are
[3:19] changed into the same
[3:22] image from glory to
[3:26] glory even as by the spirit
[3:30] of the Lord amen in other words you are
[3:33] changed from glory to glory by the same
[3:38] spirit amen you love the Lord let us
[3:41] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[3:44] you Lord as humbly as we know how and we
[3:47] thank you Father for being so real to us
[3:50] amen we bind every Spirit every thought
[3:54] that would exalt itself against the word
[3:57] Lord we place these things under our
[3:59] feet and we pray here this morning Lord
[4:02] that you have
[4:03] preeminence here this morning in Jesus
[4:06] Christ's name we commit this service
[4:09] into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ
[4:11] name we pray amen you may be
[4:18] seated amen we thank God
[4:21] for
[4:23] God for being so
[4:26] real to us amen
[4:30] God has been more gracious to us than we
[4:33] can
[4:35] imagine we find out amen that he loved
[4:39] us so
[4:40] much that he came to Earth himself amen
[4:45] he didn't send his
[4:48] secretary or his his uh uh uh uh uh
[4:52] General he came
[4:56] himself and uh we realize by the grace
[4:59] of God that uh we have ministered many
[5:02] times on uh eternal
[5:05] security and and there is a sec eternal
[5:09] security and uh but it's hard for people
[5:13] Amen to really grasp that God never told
[5:17] you to grasp it he told you believe it
[5:19] amen because really you you find out
[5:23] amen that when God does a he's a
[5:26] perfectionist he doesn't do anything
[5:30] hazly in other words when he died on
[5:33] Calvary he was not hoping that somebody
[5:37] would have pity a and believe his
[5:40] gospel God had already ordained that he
[5:44] he knew those who would believe the
[5:48] gospel he went on to say that my sheep
[5:52] heareth my voice and a stranger they
[5:55] will not follow now I I'm working with
[5:59] something here this morning because I I
[6:01] I saw some things that the prophet of
[6:03] God said that really uh spark a fire in
[6:07] me and I'm going to be working with
[6:10] character amen and I'm going to be
[6:13] working with the Bible characters amen
[6:17] so that you can
[6:20] identify this morning whose side you're
[6:23] on Amen thank you Lord because the Bible
[6:27] tells us who we are
[6:30] amen every seed should bring forth of
[6:32] his
[6:33] kind you either a a Jacob or you're an
[6:38] Esau hello amen you're either a
[6:43] Saul or
[6:46] David but you know the thing that I want
[6:48] you to understand is that we are um how
[6:53] could I say we're under
[6:56] surveillance we're literally being
[6:58] watched
[7:00] every moment of the
[7:03] day Lord by the allseeing eye who is God
[7:09] himself than you Lord and you know we we
[7:12] fail to see that we have
[7:20] photographers or let me put it this way
[7:22] a
[7:24] photographer that are literally filming
[7:27] and
[7:28] screaming our Our Lives
[7:31] amen there are flashes going on in the
[7:35] Unseen World that
[7:38] you can't
[7:40] see but God is
[7:43] always taking
[7:45] pictures and
[7:47] snapshots and filming did y'all know
[7:50] that amen the prophet of God said at the
[7:52] day of
[7:53] judgment you and I won't have to worry
[7:56] about anything because your life
[8:00] will
[8:01] Flash and be seen on the canopy of
[8:04] Heaven in other words everybody will be
[8:07] able to
[8:09] see if you're not covered by the blood
[8:12] amen your whole life amen there will not
[8:16] be uh uh uh anybody to stand uh put it
[8:21] this way and say Lord I didn't do it
[8:25] because right now you're being filmed
[8:28] amen your thoughts are being
[8:30] caught and and and all of these things
[8:33] will be
[8:35] sounded out at the day of
[8:38] judgment
[8:42] Hallelujah now I I want to read a
[8:44] scripture coming out of Isaiah
[8:47] 25 and I I'm saying these things because
[8:51] I can appear to be something to you uh
[8:55] in your thoughts uh I can be a good
[8:58] character but but but it's not about
[9:00] what you think about me amen it's about
[9:03] what God thinks about me and what God
[9:06] thinks about you amen now we're living
[9:09] in a time we're not dealing or should
[9:12] not be dealing amen with just
[9:15] children amen we are in an age where we
[9:18] must come to maturity amen so we are in
[9:22] a
[9:23] transition perhaps I could say it like
[9:25] this from adolescence to adulthood
[9:29] but nevertheless when he shall come we
[9:32] must stand in adulthood amen now you
[9:37] don't have to amen this but I'mma Bring
[9:39] It
[9:40] Anyway now we are looking at a time uh
[9:45] and and where you and I uh must be very
[9:49] very watchful unto
[9:51] prayer and supplication but but I want
[9:54] you to secure something here with those
[9:57] who can believe uh Isaiah 25 beginning
[10:01] at the 8th verse he will swallow up
[10:04] death in Victory and the Lord God will
[10:07] wipe away tears from all our faces and
[10:11] the rebuke of his people shall he take
[10:13] away from all of the Earth for the Lord
[10:18] ha spoken it amen and it shall be said
[10:22] in that day low This Is Our God we have
[10:27] waited for him
[10:30] amen and he will save us now you might
[10:34] not understand what I'm saying right now
[10:37] but the Bible tells us that in our
[10:40] patience possess ye our souls amen you
[10:43] know we would love amen many times I I
[10:46] could recall being a youngster wanting
[10:48] to be a
[10:49] man right even though the potential in
[10:52] me was there to grow up to be this man
[10:55] but you know as a little teenager we
[10:57] wanted to be a man right we wanted to be
[10:59] able to you know shap the grow the
[11:02] mustache and grow the beard and all of
[11:04] these things I can remember when I first
[11:06] got a little shadow of something H HH on
[11:09] my face and and this man
[11:12] uh basically said you think you grown
[11:15] and he shaved it off my face and I was
[11:18] upset I was upset because that was my
[11:21] first little sign of of my
[11:24] transition from just being a child to to
[11:28] growing into to adolescence and I was
[11:31] really proud of
[11:33] it but you see it wasn't the hair on my
[11:36] face that was bringing me into this new
[11:41] position it was literally the character
[11:44] it was what uh changing in other words I
[11:48] I I I I I no longer found joy in playing
[11:52] with little fire
[11:53] trucks I no longer found joy Amen in in
[11:58] playing jump rope or whatever I was
[12:00] doing Marbles and you know those kind of
[12:03] kitty games I was growing
[12:06] up and and the young the the the little
[12:09] girls that used to be my enemies has now
[12:12] changed amen something in my my mind
[12:17] began to make me look at them in such a
[12:19] different
[12:21] way am I the only
[12:24] ones amen so we realize amen that when
[12:27] this transition when God began to change
[12:30] you and and you you understand that you
[12:33] are really being watched amen by The
[12:38] tutorer Who is the holy spirit it will
[12:41] cause you to govern your life a little
[12:45] different amen amen but see you must
[12:48] realize amen that that that God just
[12:51] didn't give you something to just uh
[12:54] hope
[12:55] foru it goes beyond hope amen
[12:59] it's Faith amen and faith is greater
[13:02] than hope amen because faith is a
[13:05] revelation and and once you it is
[13:08] revealed to you your
[13:12] destiny amen hallelujah you press
[13:16] toward that Mark
[13:19] amen now he goes on to said and and he
[13:22] will save us this is the Lord we have
[13:27] waited for him and we will be glad and
[13:32] rejoice in his salvation amen now I
[13:37] think a lot of times people fail to see
[13:40] really what salvation is and this is why
[13:43] they struggle so much because people
[13:46] think that your salvation is
[13:51] conditional if you do good to God God
[13:54] will do good to you
[13:59] well I'm here to tell you that if that's
[14:01] your concept of salvation you still yet
[14:04] to be saved amen because it is not what
[14:08] you do for him it is what he has already
[14:11] done for you amen salvation if you got
[14:16] salvation it'll take away your little
[14:20] struggles of trying to impress God amen
[14:25] amen
[14:27] amen Eli
[14:29] taught those bear worshippers something
[14:33] because they were trying to impress
[14:35] their God go cut yourself go scream go
[14:39] holler go do whatever you do all these
[14:41] emotional things and
[14:43] perhaps your God will show
[14:47] up well but but but but but Elijah
[14:50] didn't do all of that while he was
[14:53] teaching them all of these things that
[14:55] they should do he says maybe your God is
[14:58] on vacation maybe he sleep you got to do
[15:01] something to get his
[15:04] attention but not with God Amen all
[15:08] Elijah had to do was build the altar
[15:11] amen He restored the Altar and that's
[15:14] what you got to do in your life restore
[15:16] the altar amen He restored the altar He
[15:20] restored the
[15:21] sacrifice and he said let the god that
[15:25] be God let him answer by fire amen and
[15:29] we find out by the grace of God why
[15:31] these bites and whatever they were doing
[15:34] worshiping and doing all of these
[15:36] cuttings and all of these emotional
[15:38] things trying to get their God's
[15:40] attention you know what he never showed
[15:45] up but when B when when Elijah set the
[15:49] altar restored amen the can I say it
[15:52] like this the the sacrifice of the seven
[15:55] Church ages and he pulled water all over
[16:00] amen he drenched the whole thing down
[16:02] with water and he called on the name of
[16:05] the Lord and the Bible tells me that God
[16:07] came down with fire and licked up the
[16:10] whole
[16:11] thing see it wasn't
[16:15] in what Elijah oh it wasn't in all the
[16:19] emotional things it was in the
[16:23] faith of
[16:25] restored altar sacrifice amen restore
[16:30] come on somebody that's what Elijah come
[16:32] to do he came to restore what the faith
[16:38] that you and I could have faith in
[16:41] it now we look at this thing because we
[16:45] find out that so many people amen have
[16:50] this let's move on but we we realize by
[16:53] the grace of God Amen that you and I
[16:56] must
[16:57] recognize what God is doing for us and
[17:03] as I said right now he's taking your
[17:05] picture you're being
[17:08] filmed coming from the message sing
[17:10] man's
[17:11] filter he says check out your
[17:15] desires what you want really in life
[17:19] check what you're fighting for check
[17:22] what you're here for check what you go
[17:25] to church for what makes you it's good
[17:29] to go to church but don't just don't
[17:32] just go to church only that won't save
[17:35] you see just check just a few
[17:39] minutes it say it's my objective what
[17:43] kind of a filter I'm drawing through
[17:45] anyhow if you won't cope with the word
[17:48] of God and your soul don't do it then
[17:52] there's something wrong amen for it
[17:55] shows up your taste that the life what
[17:59] kind of a life is in you if it's a holy
[18:03] discreet honorable it comes out that way
[18:07] if it isn't you've got another taste in
[18:10] you drawing
[18:13] from right so you and I must check
[18:17] everything what are we here
[18:20] for what is the purpose for us
[18:23] coming why do we come to make sure the
[18:27] preacher is saying it exactly right or
[18:31] are we there amen like like like the
[18:33] scripture said if we could just remove
[18:35] the veil amen we'll be able to see the
[18:38] glory of the Lord amen come on somebody
[18:42] hallelujah amen because men make
[18:44] mistakes but God never makes one
[18:47] amen Lord y'all hear what I'm saying so
[18:51] we look at this thing and you and I must
[18:54] understand that our character is now
[18:58] being
[19:00] looked
[19:01] at our character is being
[19:05] watched
[19:07] cameras are are flashing right now you
[19:11] can't even see it but it's
[19:13] happening y'all look at me crazy but
[19:15] I've got some quotes in and I've got
[19:17] some scripture but I want you to realize
[19:19] amen that I is important in this age
[19:24] right now to be obedient to the word of
[19:27] God because because that's what real
[19:30] character is amen the character of
[19:33] Christ is obeying his word amen amen
[19:37] turn with me to First Samuel
[19:46] please did you know
[19:51] this the prophet of God said
[19:54] that there's a time then I've got to
[19:57] quote but there's a Time
[19:59] that brother that that that God just
[20:02] stopped not that he completely stopped
[20:04] but he
[20:06] stopped doing Miracles am among his
[20:10] disciples and he began to teach
[20:13] them and he said except a man eat my
[20:17] flesh and drink my
[20:20] blood they have no part of me but you
[20:24] see we we want to see it all the time
[20:27] sometime God don't do things like that
[20:29] around you because he's trying to teach
[20:33] you something
[20:35] amen and you see if you are all you're
[20:38] doing is following Miracles first of all
[20:41] you shouldn't follow them they should
[20:43] follow
[20:44] you when God began to teach you he kind
[20:48] of settles you down and he telling you
[20:50] something that you need to know and he
[20:52] said except you drink my blood and eat
[20:56] my flesh
[20:58] and you say well the church is going
[21:00] dead
[21:01] now because I don't see nothing moving
[21:05] well the word
[21:06] is and the word is trying to teach
[21:11] you you know when you're a child all you
[21:13] want to do is have fun but now this is a
[21:16] serious time and he trying to teach you
[21:20] something except you eat my flesh and
[21:23] drink my blood you have no part in me
[21:29] and the Bible said
[21:30] 70
[21:33] turn hello and that's what people are
[21:35] doing I don't see all these great things
[21:38] happening so they turn for
[21:42] Sensations amen and God is trying to
[21:45] mature you
[21:47] amen hey somebody I'm going to say Amen
[21:51] anyway 1 Samuel
[21:55] 15:20 amen you love the Lord
[21:58] because God is trying to bring us to a
[22:01] place you and I don't have to worry
[22:04] about the uh miraculous per se because
[22:08] if God is in you it's going to follow
[22:11] anyway 1 Samuel
[22:16] 15:20 and Saul said unto Samuel y I have
[22:22] obeyed the voice of the Lord and have
[22:25] gone the way which the Lord sent me and
[22:27] have brought AGI gag the king of amalec
[22:31] and have utterly destroyed the
[22:34] amalekites but the people took of the
[22:37] spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the
[22:40] things which should have been utterly
[22:42] destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[22:46] God in
[22:47] gilar and Samuel said have the Lord as
[22:51] great Delight in burnt offering and
[22:54] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[22:57] the Lord
[22:59] see God don't care even how you amen
[23:01] worship hallelujah praise him see that
[23:04] means nothing to God what means more to
[23:08] God is your living the life
[23:12] amen oh come on now Leo theia can
[23:15] worship in that way better than all of
[23:18] us amen but they're dead and don't even
[23:23] know it amen behold to obey is better
[23:26] than sacrifice amen and to hearken than
[23:29] the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the
[23:33] sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[23:36] iniquity and idolatry because thou has
[23:40] rejected the word of the Lord he have
[23:43] also rejected thee from being King so
[23:47] here was Saul aen a was a king amen and
[23:51] all he had to do was obey destroy the
[23:55] king destroy all animals and every else
[23:59] but he thought he had he thought he had
[24:02] a better way of doing it see let me say
[24:05] it like this that's why I've been
[24:06] dealing with the thoughts your thoughts
[24:08] must line up to God's thoughts and God's
[24:12] thoughts is God's
[24:16] word hello
[24:18] somebody if we could realize what a
[24:21] prophet is a prophet is one who could
[24:22] take God's thoughts catch them thoughts
[24:25] and put them down for the people amen
[24:27] lay them out the pages you see that's
[24:30] how the Bible see the Bible the thoughts
[24:32] of God had already gone out before there
[24:35] was ever a written
[24:37] word hello amen and and and and those
[24:42] prophets couldn't add they couldn't just
[24:44] Implement what they thought God meant
[24:47] they had to write it down just like God
[24:49] said
[24:51] amen that's what makes the word
[24:53] infallible amen because it's not the
[24:56] thought of man but it's the thought of
[24:57] God
[24:59] and God as I said last week could not
[25:02] even reveal himself in this day until
[25:05] there was a prophet born amen that's the
[25:08] only way he can do it not by a priest
[25:10] not by a pope come on not by a bishop or
[25:13] some potentate it has to be a prophet
[25:17] and so therefore God sent us a prophet
[25:20] with this thoughts that we might
[25:22] understand salvation amen oh God have
[25:27] mercy on us
[25:29] now we look at this thing and and and
[25:32] here Saul thought that he could uh uh uh
[25:36] do you know he's King and and you got to
[25:38] be careful oh I'm bride no you've got to
[25:41] be careful Amen on how you handle this
[25:44] word because amen you can't allow uh uh
[25:48] popularity or whatever to to influence
[25:51] you because that's what happened to uh
[25:54] uh Saul uh he uh feared the people
[25:59] and so therefore he allowed himself to
[26:01] slip now watch this because he had truly
[26:05] forgotten and he comes along and says
[26:07] but I have done what God told me to do
[26:10] and and the Samuel say well if that be
[26:12] the truth then what is this bleeding out
[26:14] he in my ear what ises this sound come
[26:17] on if you have done what you God has
[26:20] told you to do then why is your life R
[26:23] why is your life still making sounds
[26:26] that it shouldn't be making amen
[26:29] it amen hallelujah
[26:32] hello
[26:35] amen Philippians please

[34:47] something wrapped around my character
[34:49] around me period it's about his
[34:52] character it's about
[34:53] him but sometime people get this that it
[34:58] it you know I don't know how you put it
[35:00] but they they they they got to it's got
[35:03] to be them and others but no it's him

[35:35] people that fear God they reverence him
[35:37] they fear Him they respect him and they
[35:40] talk about him and they hearken and
[35:43] heard it and a book of remembrance was
[35:45] written before him for them that fear
[35:48] the lord a book of
[35:51] remembrance you don't believe that's
[35:53] true it's true amen the word of God came

[38:01] condemned and is there to hinder your
[38:05] progress Hallelujah but my God it cannot
[38:09] hinder amen cuz if God has spoken it's
[38:12] already

[38:42] end of our Salvation we look at not in
[38:44] the middle not in between not at just
[38:47] the beginning it's the end of it it's
[38:49] what we are at the enden that's what God
[38:52] sees amen he took a photograph of you
[38:55] and your Perfection amen and he's
[38:58] looking at that photograph right now

[39:02] looking like now you all marred up and
[39:05] maybe hadn't come completely out of the
[39:07] dark room
[39:08] yet but God has a perfect picture of you
[39:11] amen and nothing can change it
[39:14] Hallelujah his mind about what he
[39:17] sees 2 Corinthians 3:17 this is not a
[39:20] hope salvation I hope I'm saved this is
[39:23] a no so salvation and only those whose
[39:26] name was written WR in the Lamb's Book
[39:28] of Life before the foundation of the
[39:29] world will be there as bride is that
[39:32] right 2 Corinthians
[39:36] 3:17 the Lord is that spirit and where
[39:38] the spirit of the Lord is I'm going read
[39:40] it again there is Liberty but we are
[39:44] with open faces or open face beholding
[39:49] as in a glass the glory of the Lord now
[39:52] come on somebody what are we looking at
[39:55] the glory of the Lord amen what was the
[39:58] glory of the Lord in the beginning was
[40:00] the word the word was with God and the
[40:03] Word was God and that word became flesh
[40:07] and dwelt Among Us come on somebody that
[40:10] is the glory of the Lord the glory of
[40:13] the Lord is Revelations 5 Hallelujah
[40:15] when John said who is worthy amen the
[40:18] angel said who is worthy to open the
[40:20] book and to loose the seals thereof the
[40:23] Bible said no man was worthy to loose
[40:25] come on somebody but the Bible tell John
[40:28] John Don't You Weep there's only one
[40:31] Hallelujah and it is the lion of the
[40:33] tribe of Judah and the Bible said that
[40:36] John turned to look and he saw a lamb as
[40:39] it had been slain before the foundation
[40:41] of the world that's the glory of the
[40:44] Lord hallelujah that God could take a
[40:46] child amen a man in his own image raise
[40:50] him up as a man slaughter him like a
[40:52] lamb and he become king of kings Lord of
[40:56] lords Hallelujah amen that's the glory
[40:59] the glory of the Lord is you amen that
[41:03] God could take such a sinner like you
[41:06] and me and transform
[41:09] it Glory Hallelujah change it from the
[41:12] inside
[41:14] out not patch it up and make it some
[41:17] look like some uh clown suit amen it's
[41:20] really a new garment Hallelujah a new
[41:23] person on the inside of you living
[41:26] Christ life through
[41:28] you you looking at it you say okay what
[41:31] is the glass brother bandom talks about
[41:32] it in the identification he said there
[41:35] was a young boy who had never seen a
[41:38] looking glass or a mirror so he goes to
[41:41] one of his relatives houses and up the
[41:44] stairs on the door there was a mirror
[41:47] and as the young boy climbs up the
[41:49] stairs see a lot of us we don't
[41:50] understand there was one time people
[41:51] didn't even own
[41:53] mirrors they were so poor and so
[41:56] backwards they had never seen seen one
[41:58] and this little boy was one of those
[41:59] fellas who had never seen a mirror and
[42:01] as he goes up the stairs he sees another
[42:03] little boy coming in
[42:05] view right as he goes up the stairs as
[42:09] he goes up the stairs
[42:12] amen as he's
[42:17] transitioning as he goes up the stairs
[42:19] he sees aen a a little fella
[42:22] amen all of a sudden he raised his hand
[42:25] and the fell in the mirror raised his
[42:26] hand and you know he he he he does other
[42:29] little things and all of a sudden he
[42:30] says mama that's
[42:32] me amen hallelujah he said and he
[42:36] stopped and looked at the little boy he
[42:38] was waved at him and he waved back at
[42:40] him he kept getting closer and closer
[42:43] watching the little fellow first thing
[42:44] he reached out his hand he looked around
[42:46] and his parents and watching him they
[42:49] were watching him because he'd never
[42:50] seen a mirror before that's so that's me
[42:53] so just wonder today if we could look in
[42:56] the Bible and
[42:58] say that's
[43:00] me now here I am looking into the Bible
[43:04] he didn't say no other book amen he said
[43:07] looking into the Bible and saying that's
[43:11] me I can remember when I first said that
[43:13] to somebody they thought I was crazy I
[43:16] say God woke me up and told me this is
[43:18] me amen hallelujah I know you might not
[43:23] understand it and neither do I but I
[43:25] believe what he says maybe your God
[43:27] don't talk to you but he talks to me
[43:31] amen he said this me yes
[43:36] amen when I need help and strength I go
[43:39] to the Rock
[43:43] am as we wonder which one is it which
[43:47] character in The Bible would look we
[43:51] would look like see there I'm coming now
[43:55] which character in the Bible
[43:57] you and I would look like see that's
[44:00] your
[44:02] identification there's only two kinds
[44:06] serpent seed and God's seed amen come on
[44:09] somebody and when you look into that
[44:11] word it shows you which character you
[44:15] are
[44:19] amen see our character molds us and
[44:23] that's coming from the same message
[44:24] identification 1964 our character molds
[44:27] us to the image of what we are
[44:32] amen our character of life that's in us
[44:37] that's why you can try you can practice
[44:41] you can do all you want to do amen but
[44:44] if God ain't in you it's going to reveal
[44:46] itself amen it's going to show its true
[44:50] colors because the only way that
[44:52] Christ's character can be seen through
[44:55] you and the only way it can mold you
[44:58] it's got to be in there first amen amen
[45:02] come on little somebody now you take a
[45:04] little germ of life and if that germ of
[45:07] corn it'll produce corn see the life
[45:10] that's in it molds the character of it
[45:14] then you it's the truth you can plant a
[45:16] corn tree and you can plant a different
[45:18] a stock of corn and wheat amen you never
[45:21] see that corn trying to be wheat and
[45:22] you'll never see that wheat trying to be
[45:24] corn what's ever in that seed is going
[45:26] to make it is no matter where it is it
[45:28] could be in
[45:29] India it could be
[45:31] Alaska South
[45:33] America if you can grow corn it's going
[45:36] to produce corn no matter where you're
[45:39] located it makes no
[45:41] difference because the power is in the
[45:47] seed
[45:48] hello what we are how we walk no matter
[45:52] what we say our Li speaks louder than
[45:55] our words does amen if we might say I am
[45:58] a believer in God well do you believe
[46:00] all the Bible Well I don't know then you
[46:03] see your lips your very lips is speaking
[46:06] louder than what you your words would be
[46:09] if you say I'm a Christian and do not
[46:11] believe in doing or believe I can that
[46:13] God said is true then the very the life
[46:16] any kind of life after that see your
[46:19] life speaks louder than what your
[46:21] testimony
[46:22] does and you know the one of the
[46:25] greatest hindrances of the Church of God
[46:27] amen has been the
[46:29] Bootleggers the
[46:31] gamblers them people are see we all know
[46:35] which way they're headed and they know
[46:38] themselves but the fellow that professes
[46:40] to be a Christian the woman that
[46:43] professes to be a Christian and them
[46:45] live some live something different it's
[46:48] the greatest stumbling block that's
[46:50] outside the world has got there is the
[46:54] outside world anywhere it's worse than
[46:57] anything the world can produce is a
[47:00] person that's supposed to be a Christian
[47:02] and they live something else different
[47:05] from that lying stealing cheating and
[47:09] doing things that he ought not to do is
[47:12] a discredit to his testimony and when
[47:15] you take people that do these those
[47:16] things there our character is molded in
[47:20] there by the light that is in US
[47:27] y'all better say Amen to
[47:34] god let's go back to Revelation 5 I
[47:37] quoted it but let's go back to
[47:38] Revelation
[47:39] 5 huh none of us want to do
[47:43] wrong but now is the time to make it
[47:47] right hello
[47:57] Revelation
[48:03] 5:2 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[48:06] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[48:08] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[48:10] you see that's why God gives you the
[48:11] Holy
[48:12] Ghost right the Holy Ghost will lead you
[48:15] and guide you into all truth and no man
[48:18] in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[48:20] Earth was able to open the book neither
[48:22] to look thereon and I wept much because
[48:27] no man was found worthy to open and to
[48:29] read the book neither to look their own
[48:31] now my thing is where do we where do we
[48:35] get this arrogance from this this this
[48:37] pride of thinking that you you got
[48:40] something somebody nobody listen if you
[48:42] got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy
[48:43] Ghost I got just as much God as you
[48:47] amenu y'all hear what I'm saying now the
[48:49] point is no man was worthy that means if
[48:52] without the lamb taking the book we all
[48:54] would have been lost amen I don't care
[48:56] how how righteously you think you're
[48:58] living how righteously you thought you
[49:00] lived without the lamb you're
[49:03] lost without the blood you're
[49:07] lost people say well we don't need the
[49:09] blood maybe you don't but I need it even
[49:11] if it's just to get the life out of it
[49:14] am amen now we look at this thing and
[49:18] let me say it like
[49:20] this you see religion is something that
[49:22] we've all had for a long time and that
[49:25] has been the problem of the mess message
[49:27] people are so religious but they don't
[49:29] know how to love one another they don't
[49:32] know how to fellowship with one another
[49:34] come on somebody you don't have to say
[49:36] Amen the word speaks for
[49:38] itself amen oh yeah this is not a
[49:41] Hallelujah message but I stayed in the
[49:43] presence of the Lord yesterday amen so I
[49:45] want you to understand by the grace of
[49:47] God when we look at this thing you and I
[49:48] must understand amen it doesn't matter
[49:50] whether you belong to this little
[49:52] assembly that's not important the most
[49:55] important part is that you belong to the
[49:57] body of Christ
[50:01] amen huh is that right
[50:04] hallu there ain't no difference between
[50:07] us if we're truly Born Again Believers I
[50:10] don't care if you're black yellow white
[50:12] porket out striped or purple there's no
[50:15] difference between you and
[50:17] me
[50:23] hello I look at some of y'all I tell you
[50:25] what I hope God is not Discerning your
[50:27] thoughts in the way I am now God loves
[50:30] to love to the world and God is love and
[50:34] when God projected himself to the world
[50:36] to save the world there could be nothing
[50:39] else but Sovereign Grace to produce a
[50:42] savior in other words you didn't even do
[50:44] anything to produce a
[50:47] savior
[50:50] Lord it was God's Sovereign Grace he
[50:53] decided to do
[50:55] it Hallelujah when God's love see when
[50:58] God loves something has to operate and
[51:02] God so loved the world that the divine
[51:04] Savior appeared let me put it this way
[51:06] don't you realize because you have
[51:08] accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ you
[51:10] are the very thought of God made
[51:13] manifest every everything he spoke must
[51:17] materialize it's not it cannot come back
[51:21] void it has to
[51:24] materialize whether today tomorrow but
[51:27] it must come into existence as he spoke
[51:31] it so if God spoke Bride on your behalf
[51:35] there is nothing in the elements of this
[51:37] life or this world that can stop it from
[51:46] materializing oh now in the day that
[51:49] we're living in all day we were born
[51:52] Sons and Daughters of God we are
[51:54] offspring of God and being offspring of
[51:57] God there's something about us that
[51:58] believe God there's something in you
[52:01] that calls for something and today to
[52:04] satisfy that longing in our heart many
[52:07] times we try to satisfy with education
[52:09] we try to satisfy with denomination we
[52:12] try to satisfy with f f f uh fantasies
[52:16] sorry fantastic excuse me we try to
[52:19] satisfy it with one thing and listen the
[52:22] point is you can't satisfy that other
[52:25] than with God
[52:27] amen amen Satan has caged in the human
[52:32] race and as I was studying and thought
[52:35] about
[52:37] it this world because you know I I have
[52:40] a close friend of mine who lives in West
[52:43] Virginia and she has always told me that
[52:46] you know that I'm in
[52:48] bondage because of the way we believe
[52:51] because the way we dress because of the
[52:54] way we act she's supposed to be a
[52:56] Christian too but she look at the women
[52:58] and they can't wear makeup and you know
[53:00] cut their hair and do all and she says
[53:03] that's just
[53:05] bondage you know and I I say this by the
[53:08] grace of God Amen then if if then what
[53:12] is
[53:13] freedom because in 1963 around that time
[53:17] you had the hippies the yippies and
[53:19] whatever more coming out saying that we
[53:21] want to be free we're tired of morals
[53:25] and laws we want to behave the way we
[53:28] want to behave and they did it just like
[53:30] that they thought they were literally
[53:32] coming out from bondage into
[53:35] freedom and all they were doing is
[53:38] moving in a transition from one slave to
[53:41] another at one time God was their Master
[53:44] but now they chose for Satan to be their
[53:47] Master they ended up being engaged into
[53:50] slavy and immorality and drugs became
[53:53] their gods come on somebody and they
[53:55] called that
[53:56] Liberty then Hollywood came in to wash
[54:00] to brainwash them and now they become uh
[54:03] uh uh television addicts and and movie
[54:06] star addicts and addicted amen come on
[54:10] somebody addicted to movies and stars
[54:14] and and yet they're free come on some
[54:17] they're not free amen and their masters
[54:20] are demons out of hell amen but they
[54:23] chose that over God Amen and so is it
[54:27] today come on somebody oh yeah they
[54:30] protested in the 60s they wanted to be
[54:32] free from morals in the church and and
[54:34] they were freed and they became slaves
[54:36] to sex and morality and drugs is that
[54:39] right now they're prisoners of Hollywood
[54:41] and demons that comes with
[54:44] it y'all don't believe that but it's
[54:46] true that television brainwashed more
[54:49] people than anything in the world and
[54:51] are you going to church to be rainwash
[54:53] yes I'm going to church to be
[54:57] brainwashed Washed by the

[55:29] iPhone 4 and I got a iPhone 4 and I need
[55:32] a iPhone 5

[55:57] God maturing in the Lord while the world
[56:01] is gone for their
[56:04] Fantastics
[56:06] maturing understanding that the fire
[56:09] that's getting ready to come is going to
[56:10] burn it all
[56:12] up
[56:14] maturing to the fact that this is not
[56:16] our world this is not our home and
[56:18] therefore I don't seek a home in this
[56:21] land
[56:22] amen
[56:24] maturing character of Christ Christ
[56:27] knowing the purpose for which we came
[56:30] they said Jesus are you a king he said

[56:35] purpose came I into the world to do what

[57:08] to say like this there's nothing like
[57:09] going around message people who thinkk
[57:10] they God at all and everywhere I go
[57:13] there's always somebody trying to tell
[57:16] you
[57:16] something something that's not even
[57:19] scriptural but they they feel like they
[57:21] obligated to tell you because they're
[57:23] right that has been the that has been
[57:25] the downfall of Christianity cuz every
[57:28] organization and denomination think
[57:30] they're
[57:33] right hello the Bible tells us like this
[57:36] there were seven women and none were
[57:38] found
[57:40] faithful and the woman types out the
[57:42] church hello amen it listen you must
[57:46] understand because we were born of a
[57:47] woman we have a body called
[57:50] death and the only way that you going to
[57:53] escape this body is that you be born by
[57:55] a
[57:57] man Hallelujah and that man is Jesus
[58:00] Christ himself Hallelujah that was the
[58:03] process that it was supposed to be in
[58:04] the beginning it was Adam who was
[58:06] supposed to speak amen amen and bring
[58:10] forth a birth come on somebody
[58:14] hallelujah amen to be born of the man
[58:16] Christ Jesus is the one who will you
[58:18] will escape this body of sin and
[58:22] death it must come a perfect nature
[58:26] I'm almost done because y this is what
[58:28] y'all pulling for listen we come to this
[58:31] place and you and I must understand it
[58:34] took a perfect nature you and I don't
[58:35] have a perfect nature we're flawed
[58:38] that's why Paul said it's a body of
[58:39] death remember I I read you that quote
[58:42] last week where brother Bram said he was
[58:44] the
[58:45] perversion right he's the perversion he
[58:47] was the one amen you and I were born of
[58:49] sin bodies Jesus Christ was not amen he
[58:52] said he had to die but Jesus never did
[58:55] amen see listen you and I must
[58:58] understand amen by the grace of God Amen
[59:00] that we are the perversion we were born
[59:01] of a woman we've got sin in this old
[59:04] flesh we got a we got something that's
[59:06] on the inside of us that don't want
[59:08] don't want to do right it is your arch
[59:10] enemy it ain't the devil is you amen you
[59:14] the enemy of yourself come on somebody
[59:17] the greatest enemy if you didn't have
[59:19] this man Satan couldn't move
[59:22] you right now the devil listen your body
[59:26] don't want you to reflect
[59:33] God your body don't want you to reflect
[59:36] God your body listen your body wants to
[59:41] do the things that are of the world but
[59:44] it is the inner man that God is looking
[59:47] at amen it is the nature that he's put
[59:49] into you come on somebody I remember
[59:52] when I was there in in in Africa and you
[59:54] know I had a a little uh Cub Pat her and
[59:57] everything her little Sarah you know she
[59:59] was a little cute little cub and her
[1:00:01] parents were she was found out in the in
[1:00:03] the in the wilderness and she was
[1:00:05] on the game W you know he he took her in
[1:00:09] and you know she was cute when she was a
[1:00:10] kitty but a few years later she was no
[1:00:13] longer a kitty she was a lioness I
[1:00:16] wasn't about to go Pat
[1:00:19] Sarah y'all understand what I mean we
[1:00:22] went walking Sarah with this little
[1:00:24] stick and the whole time I never thought
[1:00:27] about how when she was a
[1:00:29] kitty her nature had changed
[1:00:32] amen she's now a lion is she she might
[1:00:36] look similar but now she's bigger you
[1:00:38] know she's got a different uh
[1:00:40] perspective of life and she's now become
[1:00:43] a a
[1:00:46] hunter back in that day we had to feed
[1:00:49] her but now she's become a
[1:00:51] hunter and guess what she
[1:00:54] hunts so my point is listen listen
[1:00:57] people of God you y'all better be
[1:00:59] careful you better be careful you know
[1:01:02] we look at these things and you say you
[1:01:04] you might say well I know all of this
[1:01:05] you don't know all of this because if
[1:01:07] you knew all of this God wouldn't be
[1:01:08] speaking it amen that's right amen that
[1:01:11] attitude caught God now let me say it
[1:01:14] like this you and I must recognize amen
[1:01:17] that God Amen is in the midst of this
[1:01:20] place it might seem simple but I can
[1:01:23] tell you
[1:01:24] now only a small percentag is catching
[1:01:26] what I'm trying to say
[1:01:29] Amen we have allowed Satan to make us
[1:01:32] think we we've arrived and you haven't
[1:01:35] Lord there's a there's a maturing amen
[1:01:39] I'm going tell you like this if you
[1:01:41] think in your mind that if somebody came
[1:01:43] in here with a machine gun to kill you
[1:01:45] that you'll be able to stand and you've
[1:01:48] got to
[1:01:50] recognize you'll be put to the
[1:01:53] test remember the prophet of God spoke
[1:01:55] of
[1:01:56] message there's a man who could turn on
[1:01:58] the light Hallelujah and in that message
[1:02:01] he tells us how the World Council of
[1:02:03] churches are going to throw us into
[1:02:05] darkness he said just like that it'll
[1:02:07] come upon you he said that little girl
[1:02:10] who was screaming represented the
[1:02:13] bride should I read you the
[1:02:16] quote should I read you the quote that
[1:02:19] little girl that was screaming amen
[1:02:22] represented the bride cuz she was
[1:02:24] scared and that little boy said oh
[1:02:27] little sister amen Don't Be Afraid amen
[1:02:31] there's a man who could turn on the
[1:02:34] lights he said even at that point if you
[1:02:37] recognize the message to be right he
[1:02:39] said you're too late
[1:02:43] amen you're too
[1:02:47] late and we can sit up here let me say
[1:02:50] it like this these words that are being
[1:02:52] spoken to us this morning you're going
[1:02:55] to be a
[1:02:58] accountable for what you've heard this
[1:03:00] morning
[1:03:01] amen God ain't concerned about your
[1:03:04] tradition he ain't concerned about your
[1:03:07] habits and your ways and the oh come on
[1:03:09] somebody he's looking at character amen
[1:03:12] if the character of Christ is not in you
[1:03:15] when he return you will not go with
[1:03:19] him how you going to get it you got to
[1:03:22] go through some fire amen you got to go
[1:03:24] through some trial but most of all see I
[1:03:27] used to be a runner and you got to have
[1:03:29] a goal you got to have something fixed
[1:03:31] and when I I used to be a cross country
[1:03:33] one you got to have your timing set
[1:03:36] right you can't just run because you
[1:03:37] want to run you know you can't you don't
[1:03:39] start off with all that you got you got
[1:03:41] to pace yourself and know what you're
[1:03:43] working with come on somebody amen and
[1:03:45] so it is but you have a goal you know
[1:03:47] the the length of the run and you have a
[1:03:50] goal that you're pressing toward amen
[1:03:52] people of God you got to have a goalen
[1:03:55] in your heart and in your mind and you
[1:03:57] can't let God stop until it's completely
[1:04:01] finished in
[1:04:03] you Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:04:06] saying let me put it this way for most
[1:04:09] of the people and I'm not bragging but I
[1:04:11] say like this I probably don't seen the
[1:04:12] pillar of five more than most of
[1:04:15] you I don't seen the pill of cloud I
[1:04:17] don't seen the dead raised I've seen
[1:04:20] cancer healed I didn't ask for it I was
[1:04:23] just there in the right place at the
[1:04:24] right time
[1:04:26] but I'm not I'm not stupid Israel saw
[1:04:29] all the Miracles of
[1:04:31] Egypt huh and only two of them were
[1:04:33] saved amen why because they kept the
[1:04:36] right mental attitude toward the word am
[1:04:38] hello somebody amen listen I don't care
[1:04:41] it doesn't matter how much you've seen
[1:04:42] is whether you keep the right middle of
[1:04:46] attitude oh my the nature of God on the
[1:04:50] inside amen is not one who looks at
[1:04:53] others as if you listen and this is I
[1:04:55] know I'm I'm I'm feeling it right you
[1:04:57] know we look at this thing we say well
[1:04:59] you know uh I I this is what I love
[1:05:02] brother Brandon for one of the reason he
[1:05:06] he loved
[1:05:07] everybody even his
[1:05:09] enemies and it was more than lip
[1:05:12] service it was
[1:05:15] action you can't tell me you love me and
[1:05:18] there is no
[1:05:19] action there's no signs of you loving me
[1:05:23] yet you love me what Jesus Christ God
[1:05:26] loved me so much he sacrificed he didn't
[1:05:28] just leave it on the pages he came down
[1:05:30] and proved his love love proves itself
[1:05:33] oh come on somebody amen is that right
[1:05:36] listen the only way that you'll ever be
[1:05:38] able to express God's word that you
[1:05:40] believe it and watch it act behind you
[1:05:43] you have to have the sinless nature that
[1:05:45] comes from
[1:05:46] God
[1:05:50] Amen sinless nature am that comes from
[1:05:54] God that's out of in ident ification you
[1:05:56] the sinless
[1:05:59] nature not your nature amen you see
[1:06:03] that's the way I am yeah that's the
[1:06:05] problem the way you are the way you are
[1:06:08] got to die
[1:06:10] amen hallelujah his thoughts as I say is
[1:06:13] a Christian today is that right can I
[1:06:17] ask you a question when God thought
[1:06:19] about Moses what was his
[1:06:24] thoughts when amram and
[1:06:26] yoseth had Moses they knew he was a
[1:06:29] proper
[1:06:31] child somehow God revealed that cuz
[1:06:34] looking at a little baby in the crib you
[1:06:36] would never know
[1:06:37] it somehow God revealed that right
[1:06:40] probably with a pillar of fire or
[1:06:41] something like he normally
[1:06:46] does and here was Moses and Pharaoh's
[1:06:50] house being raised as an Egyptian
[1:06:55] it would have looked like it
[1:06:57] was not going to work whatever God
[1:07:01] thought about Moses it ain't
[1:07:04] happening hello God is here on the right
[1:07:07] side and Moses way on the left
[1:07:09] hand learn all the Egyptian ways brother
[1:07:13] B said he was a
[1:07:16] scholar probably M Magnum Kum he was up
[1:07:20] there he was teaching the teach us like
[1:07:24] Jesus on
[1:07:27] and it would have looked like it wasn't
[1:07:28] going to happen but God's thought about
[1:07:31] Moses amen was that he was to to deliver
[1:07:34] the children of
[1:07:35] Israel so Moses believed his mama his
[1:07:38] mama told him the story according to the
[1:07:40] prophet is that right and we find out
[1:07:42] that Moses thought that he could do it
[1:07:44] on his own human ability like some of us
[1:07:47] think you can change your character on
[1:07:50] your own human ability and the only
[1:07:52] thing that you're going to ever produce
[1:07:54] is a dead man
[1:07:57] amen this is not
[1:08:02] psychology and so what happens am he he
[1:08:05] produces a dead man but listen it was
[1:08:07] all set up Hallelujah God knew that he
[1:08:10] needed Moses out there in the wilderness
[1:08:13] Amen Let me put it this way so when
[1:08:15] tragical things happen to your in your
[1:08:16] life it's set up amen God set it up to
[1:08:22] get your attention Hallelujah it was the
[1:08:24] only way he Moses full attention amen he
[1:08:28] first had to strip him from his
[1:08:30] pride amen strip him of his knowledge go
[1:08:34] come on somebody he had to strip Moses
[1:08:37] he didn't leave nothing on Moses by the
[1:08:39] time Moses got up on the mountain he
[1:08:41] said take them shoes
[1:08:43] off even to his shoes take off your
[1:08:48] shoes the ground you standing on is Holy
[1:08:51] he had to strip him and let me tell you
[1:08:53] something if you be SE
[1:08:56] God will strip you from all of your
[1:09:00] ways no matter what it takes God's will
[1:09:03] be done
[1:09:04] amen his mind toward you come on
[1:09:08] somebody I'm coming here amen cuz I want
[1:09:11] you to understand you can all we can be
[1:09:13] uh like Samuel who who said now listen
[1:09:16] Saul you did not do all that God said
[1:09:18] because I can see and this is what I'm
[1:09:20] working with right now you saying you've
[1:09:22] done all that God say but I can see I
[1:09:25] hear I see and what is this that I hear
[1:09:28] and see you have not killed everything
[1:09:32] amen and God don't want those sacrifices
[1:09:35] that you offered he wants
[1:09:41] obedience Hallelujah come on somebody
[1:09:45] now you can be amen like those who were
[1:09:47] at Simon's house Simon invited Jesus and
[1:09:51] we all invite Jesus to church and
[1:09:53] sometimes I I tell you one thing y'all
[1:09:55] it's it's a shame that we do god like
[1:09:57] that if we were sitting up out at a ball
[1:09:59] game we'll be screaming and holler and
[1:10:00] singing and shouting and laughing and

[1:17:43] on Mount Karma where would you
[1:17:45] be let all of them that on the Lord's
[1:17:48] Side come on over here Moses said come
[1:17:49] on over here remember when they did that
[1:17:52] there in in in the wilderness Aon and
[1:17:54] the rest of them I'm jumping back now
[1:17:57] when they they they built this golden
[1:17:59] calf right and what they did made be
[1:18:02] deity out of a
[1:18:05] beast come on remember when that great
[1:18:07] Roman leader thought he was God and he
[1:18:09] felt dead right there cuz he lifted
[1:18:11] himself up remember Nebuchadnezzar I
[1:18:13] believe it down there in Babylon who
[1:18:14] thought he was so
[1:18:16] great right amen and what happened to
[1:18:19] him he ended up in the field acting like
[1:18:20] an animal a beast but here they come
[1:18:25] and B here they come along and they
[1:18:29] actually uh build a calf a golden calf a
[1:18:33] beast out of gold and said this and
[1:18:37] listen you will always know the effect
[1:18:41] of the golden calf because you began to
[1:18:44] strip
[1:18:47] yourself let me tell you something
[1:18:50] messes
[1:18:51] Church there in in in where I come from
[1:18:54] from began to let the women cut their
[1:18:58] hair oh you can wear makeup
[1:19:01] until God gives you a
[1:19:04] revelation men wearing
[1:19:06] shorts
[1:19:08] come don't tell me I know what a golden
[1:19:11] calf look like amen hello somebody and
[1:19:14] that same group of people ends up
[1:19:15] denying the
[1:19:18] cloud hello so listen people it's
[1:19:22] real when you began to let down to
[1:19:25] standard there's somewhere a golden calf
[1:19:28] and you know what they said they take
[1:19:29] the tradition of the prophet's life and
[1:19:31] they said well he did it so I can do it
[1:19:34] and brother B said that's where men fall
[1:19:36] when they take the prophet's life and
[1:19:38] make a tradition out of
[1:19:40] it it ain't his life is what this this
[1:19:43] Bible declare amen oh y'all don't like
[1:19:47] it but in his way so we look at this
[1:19:50] thing and what about Elijah you know
[1:19:53] Elijah was building
[1:19:55] The Altar and they they both building
[1:19:57] altars you know Moab and Moab was just a
[1:20:00] mixture anyway and they building the
[1:20:01] Altar and he's building the Altar and
[1:20:03] you know seven altars seven Rams seven
[1:20:06] you know they had all of the the
[1:20:07] fundamental things right in place but
[1:20:10] what they failed to see was the
[1:20:13] Covenant they failed to see who Elijah
[1:20:16] was come on somebody now let me put it
[1:20:18] this way and I'm going to close on
[1:20:20] this your character and I I didn't go
[1:20:23] get back to the Flash part cuz that's
[1:20:26] what brother B said he said flash he
[1:20:29] literally use the word flash he said
[1:20:31] your life is caught on the camera amen
[1:20:35] the photo has caught you amen you can't
[1:20:38] deny it you ever seen people do that
[1:20:41] amen especially in Hollywood the
[1:20:43] paparazzi find the people doing things
[1:20:45] they ain't got no business
[1:20:47] go you can't deny it you were there you
[1:20:51] did
[1:20:52] it and that's how God is and his holy
[1:20:55] spirit
[1:20:55] he when y'all think God ain't looking he
[1:20:58] watching every moment think about it
[1:21:00] think about it think about it what you
[1:21:02] fail to see the bible say that fear of
[1:21:03] the Lord the angel of the Lord encamp
[1:21:05] about those you're not by yourself you
[1:21:07] can't see it but they're there watching
[1:21:09] everything every move you make every
[1:21:13] thought you perceive and conceive that
[1:21:16] God is right there watching you
[1:21:21] amen and what you going to do about it
[1:21:25] the only thing that can conquer that is
[1:21:26] the nature of God
[1:21:29] Amen y'all hear what I said the Holy
[1:21:32] Ghost is the only thing your human
[1:21:33] ability can't conquer that nature it
[1:21:36] just make things worse yes amen hello

[1:21:42] was raised Muslim part Muslim and part
[1:21:45] Christian my daddy was a Muslim and my
[1:21:47] mama was a Christian and one thing I
[1:21:50] know
[1:21:52] about a lot of the
[1:21:55] Muslims mainly like
[1:21:58] Christians is that they can wear all the
[1:22:00] outer
[1:22:01] garments but the inside is
[1:22:07] filthy look so holy but the inside is
[1:22:12] filthy that's not what we
[1:22:15] want I could care less about the outside
[1:22:18] let the inside be holy hello and we find
[1:22:22] out by the grace of God this is where
[1:22:24] you and I must recognize that God is
[1:22:27] trying to clean you up and bring a
[1:22:30] transition amen but he said whosoever
[1:22:34] will whosoever will God is not going to
[1:22:37] go over your will he's not going to
[1:22:38] force you to do anything and if you're
[1:22:41] bride it's going to it's an anointing
[1:22:42] that comes with this age amen amen when
[1:22:46] God looked at Gideon are you a Gideon

[1:22:58] strength no he did not God said I'll go
[1:23:01] before you Gideon I'll fight this battle
[1:23:03] for you Gideon and Gideon had to say

[1:23:08] let this fleece be wet let this fleece
[1:23:10] be Dr are you sure I'm the right see he
[1:23:13] had a hard time with identification
[1:23:16] which is a lot of us amen we have a hard
[1:23:18] time with identifying ourselves as
[1:23:22] bride and because we have a heart time
[1:23:24] we always want this sign we always want
[1:23:26] that sign it ain't that it's taking God
[1:23:29] at his word
[1:23:32] amen when you take God at his word the
[1:23:35] signs will follow amen amen maturing
[1:23:40] amen coming into a place amen that this
[1:23:42] word is you and you are the
[1:23:45] word brother B said one thing about a
[1:23:47] True Believer said when he make a
[1:23:49] mistake he immediately say Lord forgive
[1:23:50] me amen right off the battle if he say
[1:23:53] something to somebody says well I I
[1:23:54] didn't mean to say it that way forgive
[1:23:56] me
[1:23:59] see but let me say it like this to you
[1:24:02] people we're in a day and I'm
[1:24:04] closing we're in a day in an hour that
[1:24:08] there's going to be so many people who
[1:24:09] are
[1:24:13] disappointed very
[1:24:18] disappointed because you know
[1:24:21] they put this way
[1:24:24] let me say it like this there was a
[1:24:26] young
[1:24:28] lady who had gone to the insane
[1:24:32] asylum because her
[1:24:35] boyfriend married another
[1:24:38] girl and she was so in
[1:24:42] love with this
[1:24:45] boy and she could not get over the fact
[1:24:48] that he went and married someone
[1:24:51] else and she told Brother Bram she
[1:24:53] actually believed that she know this boy
[1:24:56] love brother B said get over it
[1:24:59] basically he could not have loved you
[1:25:02] and married
[1:25:04] another but he said what you see what
[1:25:06] had happened she had created a world in
[1:25:10] her own
[1:25:11] mind she wanted to believe that this boy
[1:25:14] loved her and she created that world
[1:25:18] herself in her own
[1:25:20] mind and though the he never loved her
[1:25:24] in her mind he did and that was the
[1:25:28] thing that drove him crazy her crazy
[1:25:31] excuse me see that's what happened to a
[1:25:33] lot of us we create these things in our
[1:25:36] minds and it's going to take the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost to come and release us from it we
[1:25:41] make ourselves believe a
[1:25:43] lie and that same lie works on our mind
[1:25:46] to almost drive us
[1:25:48] crazy hello
[1:25:50] somebody when somebody love you they'll
[1:25:53] die for you
[1:25:55] come on y'all hear what I'm saying don't
[1:25:57] it's it's what you've created in your
[1:25:59] mind surely he must
[1:26:01] know his action will prove the love amen
[1:26:06] or her action however you want to put it
[1:26:08] but we create these things in our mind
[1:26:10] see that's how powerful your thoughts
[1:26:12] are your thoughts
[1:26:14] create come on somebody amen your
[1:26:18] thoughts will create an imagine and you
[1:26:21] can create a whole world
[1:26:24] around
[1:26:27] Illusions and you'll believe
[1:26:30] it that's why so many people right now
[1:26:33] in their s or silent right now because
[1:26:35] they've allowed themselves to create a
[1:26:38] world that doesn't even
[1:26:41] exist huh and that's what happens to a
[1:26:43] lot of Christians they in their minds
[1:26:47] create this world I'm saved and they
[1:26:49] have no evidence of it they got no life
[1:26:53] to back it up they got nothing there and
[1:26:55] Satan will allow you to cocoon yourself
[1:26:57] into that
[1:27:00] world when God said these signs shall
[1:27:02] follow them that believe amen amen God
[1:27:06] said if you're born of God you have the
[1:27:07] love of God Amen hey somebody come on
[1:27:11] somebody and then so you can't allow
[1:27:13] yourself I'm telling you you got to see
[1:27:15] a change and if there's not a change you
[1:27:17] need to be at the altar somewhere you
[1:27:20] need to be crying out to God make the
[1:27:22] change amen and if I ever built my world
[1:27:26] around lies Lord break these lies up
[1:27:29] destroy these lies hallelujah amen I
[1:27:32] need to know that God is in me because
[1:27:34] he said in that day you'll know the
[1:27:35] father's in me I am in you is that right
[1:27:39] I'm in him and he's in me and I'm in you
[1:27:41] is that right so God said listen we
[1:27:43] can't allow ourselves Amen to build the
[1:27:46] state if so let the Holy Ghost come and
[1:27:49] destroy that thing that you may be free
[1:27:53] amen when brother around and brought her
[1:27:54] to her attention what she had done the
[1:27:57] reason why he tricked her he made her
[1:27:59] think that he loved her and you know how
[1:28:01] they said if you love me then you sleep
[1:28:03] with
[1:28:05] me and so she thought because he loved
[1:28:08] her she did that that that was love and
[1:28:10] what and he used her huh and she did not
[1:28:14] want to believe she had been
[1:28:20] used hello
[1:28:24] let us not let the devil use us
[1:28:27] people if you love God you keep his
[1:28:31] commandment you'll do everything you can
[1:28:34] to do what God wants you to do if it
[1:28:37] means you're skinning your own
[1:28:39] self amen that's
[1:28:43] stand
[1:28:49] character how many of us would have done
[1:28:51] like
[1:28:52] Peter holy spirit said Peter you got to
[1:28:55] go
[1:28:56] back this is your time to
[1:29:02] die that's

[1:29:50] it
[1:29:51] home you see the message made it to the
[1:29:53] people people it's supposed to get to
[1:29:56] and I'm one of
[1:29:58] them you see that's what people don't
[1:30:00] understand like I was a lot of people
[1:30:03] you know we we we don't even understand
[1:30:05] what a prophet is that's why sometime
[1:30:07] you know people have a hard time with it
[1:30:09] but let me tell you something without a
[1:30:10] prophet we wouldn't have this messag
[1:30:11] amen according to Amos 3:7 God can't
[1:30:14] even reveal nothing to us except he
[1:30:16] reveal it to his Prophet first then his
[1:30:19] Prophet comes and he tell us like Noah
[1:30:21] nobody would have never known the world
[1:30:22] was coming to an end
[1:30:24] God dropped the thought in Noah's heart
[1:30:26] Noah became a preacher and God did what
[1:30:28] he said hallelujah amen Moses knew God
[1:30:33] came down to destroy Egypt right right
[1:30:36] that's what he was sent for nobody else
[1:30:38] knew they was living just like everybody
[1:30:40] else and they were so engrossed Amen in
[1:30:42] the Egyptian world that when Moses first
[1:30:45] came they weren't ready for him just
[1:30:47] like this message amen when the prophet
[1:30:50] first came they weren't ready they ready
[1:30:51] now people ready to get out of Ed is
[1:30:54] that right they're ready to lead this
[1:30:55] world now come on now God can do a Third
[1:30:58] Exodus Hallelujah he can bring a
[1:31:01] translation CU we're ready
[1:31:03] amen this time we're not carrying
[1:31:06] nothing of Egypt with us hallelujah
[1:31:08] we're leaving
[1:31:10] everything Hallelujah but I'm going tell
[1:31:12] you something people of God I want you
[1:31:14] to really meditate on what was preached
[1:31:16] this
[1:31:17] morning if you could grasp anything I
[1:31:19] pray that you grasp that there is a
[1:31:21] transition going on and and there's a
[1:31:24] stage of moving from whatever adolescent
[1:31:26] whatever stage you in you got to move on
[1:31:28] up to
[1:31:29] maturity right because I'm going telling
[1:31:32] you the dark room is
[1:31:34] coming it's prophecy it's the thought of
[1:31:37] God it's coming and I'll read prob have
[1:31:40] some things this evening but I want you
[1:31:41] to understand by the grace of God this
[1:31:43] is not a thing that we can play with
[1:31:46] it's real and and and I'm going tell you
[1:31:48] something America it's not just America
[1:31:51] it's the whole world everywhere I've
[1:31:52] gone is filthy and polluted
[1:31:54] it really is but America is being judged
[1:31:56] because of the mighty wonders and signs
[1:31:59] and wonders that was done in her and she
[1:32:01] rejected it anyway I mean we had more
[1:32:03] prophets and reform whatever we had we
[1:32:05] had more Ministries in America trying to
[1:32:08] wake her up than the history of the
[1:32:10] whole world or Roberts Billy Graham come
[1:32:15] on some Tommy Hicks all of these people
[1:32:17] William brandom all of these people on
[1:32:18] the field of America surely God must
[1:32:21] have loved
[1:32:22] her but because because she rejected it
[1:32:25] listen she will be destroyed
[1:32:28] amen we're past the age of Sodom and
[1:32:31] Gomorrah we into something
[1:32:33] else it's worse than that day it's worse
[1:32:36] than Pompei it's worse than com uh uh in
[1:32:39] the days of of of uh capernium it's
[1:32:43] worse and you expect God to Let It Go on
[1:32:46] like this it's not people and and one of
[1:32:50] the thoughts I I wanted to say in
[1:32:52] closing it is a wise Nation it is a wise
[1:32:56] country it is a wise people that
[1:32:59] prepares for war in a time of
[1:33:05] Peace this is a Warfare this ain't no
[1:33:08] joke it wasn't it was just yesterday we
[1:33:11] saw what those demons did to to the Jews
[1:33:14] staling and Hitler melini and all of
[1:33:16] them come on somebody that was just
[1:33:21] yesterday that's your day and you think
[1:33:24] people ain't going to do that
[1:33:27] now you think it's not no the Bible said
[1:33:30] evil seducers get worse and worse you
[1:33:32] and I cannot imagine the torture and and
[1:33:35] I'm not trying to put fear I'm trying to
[1:33:37] put re a reality in your
[1:33:41] heart you and I must recognize the day
[1:33:44] we're living in and let everything else
[1:33:47] listen the first priority is to make it
[1:33:50] into the ark amen
[1:33:54] come on somebody the first priority is
[1:33:57] to make it inside once you get inside
[1:34:00] you don't have to worry about nothing
[1:34:01] else you're taken care of the first
[1:34:04] priority is to make sure that you sealed
[1:34:06] with the Holy Ghost y'all hear what I'm
[1:34:08] saying this worldly Goods everything
[1:34:10] else means nothing amen people don't
[1:34:13] care whether you're rich or poor they
[1:34:15] don't care and you and I must come to a
[1:34:18] place listen it doesn't matter whether I
[1:34:19] got a billion a million what good if it
[1:34:22] my soul ain't right with God God
[1:34:25] Amen and knowing this message being able
[1:34:28] to quote it verbatim or or know what
[1:34:30] book and Page Don't Mean a Thing the
[1:34:33] devil knows that
[1:34:34] too but when that life is formed in you
[1:34:38] brother B say God Legion wasn't afraid
[1:34:40] of of no man Legion saw the
[1:34:43] character he saw what was coming at him
[1:34:46] he saw the character demons ain't afraid
[1:34:48] of nothing but character and that's
[1:34:50] God's character amen not human made
[1:34:53] character God 's
[1:34:54] character and when he saw Jesus come
[1:34:57] even the demons know the word is true
[1:34:59] when some of us struggle with it he said
[1:35:02] are you come to torment me before our
[1:35:05] time they knew know they going to be
[1:35:07] tormented
[1:35:09] amen hallelujah I I get zerious I get
[1:35:13] zerious I get jealous if you want to say
[1:35:15] it like this when I can see people like
[1:35:17] uh uh Beyonce who knows she's got a
[1:35:20] demon you you look at some of these
[1:35:22] Stars they know that demon in them and
[1:35:25] they let them demons listen they didn't
[1:35:26] just get those demons overnight they
[1:35:28] worked at it you got to work at opening
[1:35:30] your
[1:35:33] spirit but they know who they are even
[1:35:36] though they know they going to hell for
[1:35:40] it
[1:35:45] hello and you think the devil ain't the
[1:35:48] devil ain't Heaven told them they going
[1:35:50] to have eternal life
[1:35:53] you think the devil a hadn't offered
[1:35:55] them
[1:35:56] something you the devil ain't saying
[1:35:58] well listen you know but they know
[1:36:00] Listen People let me put it this way if
[1:36:04] if if a if if people can open themselves
[1:36:05] to demons and them demons can have
[1:36:07] control like that what about us if we
[1:36:09] could just open oursel to the Holy
[1:36:12] Ghost you see what I'm saying it's you
[1:36:16] you as an individual got to open up to
[1:36:19] God it don't have to be here it could be
[1:36:21] at your house wherever you want to be in
[1:36:23] the midst of a feel somewhere but you
[1:36:25] need to get
[1:36:26] somewhere to let God completely come
[1:36:29] into your life I used to be so
[1:36:36] concerned about
[1:36:40] anointings and the Holy Spirit spoke to
[1:36:42] me yesterday he's trying to teach you
[1:36:45] something you're trying to grow he's
[1:36:47] trying to bring you into a
[1:36:49] maturity you know because everything's
[1:36:51] going to cease
[1:36:54] everything's going to cease tongue's
[1:36:56] going to cease all these things going to
[1:36:59] cease everything but the
[1:37:02] word and guess what even in the most a
[1:37:05] lot of people Divine love is going to
[1:37:07] Cease the love of many will wax
[1:37:10] cold right you know what makes that
[1:37:13] happen when you become
[1:37:14] judgmental when you start looking at
[1:37:16] something and looking at that and
[1:37:17] judging it the wrong way like the told
[1:37:21] me that anyway that's the truth
[1:37:24] he T me so he said me and my my my
[1:37:27] son-in-law was talking other day he
[1:37:28] talked about the man who said you got
[1:37:30] three three fingers po that he said but
[1:37:32] hey so now he don't point this way he
[1:37:35] point this way but that's the truth and
[1:37:38] then you got to recognize amen that you
[1:37:41] know Jesus said if you put away the
[1:37:43] pointing of the finger I'll heal
[1:37:46] you and that's the thing we we
[1:37:49] constantly do we've got to stop it amen
[1:37:53] my heart is trying to pour out to
[1:37:56] you um and I in
[1:38:00] closing God loves
[1:38:03] you but do you love
[1:38:08] God do you love
[1:38:12] God I tell you what uh both of my
[1:38:16] grandbabies uh Judah and
[1:38:19] um Nehemiah love the the tamarine
[1:38:25] I wish I had it on film my wife bought
[1:38:28] both of them Tamarin the other day and
[1:38:31] the
[1:38:32] expression of those babies
[1:38:35] were
[1:38:38] Priceless it was
[1:38:40] like I can't explain it it was just like
[1:38:43] oh I've never seen anybody that would
[1:38:46] appreciate such toys but it's like I
[1:38:49] can't explain it but it it I'll never
[1:38:52] forget it
[1:38:54] and that was a
[1:38:56] tambourine now one thing I I I I I I
[1:38:59] know about Jude uh Nehemiah I can't say
[1:39:02] about Jud because I'm not there but
[1:39:04] sometime they I know he he likes to play
[1:39:09] it early morning and he likes to play it
[1:39:11] at
[1:39:14] night and he
[1:39:18] worships he really worship they both
[1:39:21] do and and and Judah uh Judah get his
[1:39:25] one leg and he work that thing and he
[1:39:28] work it
[1:39:30] right and in Nehemiah he jumps I ain't
[1:39:33] never seen a bo boy baby like that I
[1:39:35] they both you know you look at them and
[1:39:37] you think what's going
[1:39:39] on you think they just playing no no
[1:39:42] it's serious and they they're not
[1:39:43] playing it's real serious things going
[1:39:45] on in there and and until the natural
[1:39:47] eye you'll miss
[1:39:49] it when I went down to brother Craig's
[1:39:51] church and seen all those little
[1:39:53] children all the way up just in there
[1:39:55] telling me what was preached and how and
[1:39:58] this and the scriptures and this just
[1:40:01] and I'm thinking here's these old
[1:40:03] folks something's going
[1:40:06] on and I'm going tell you something
[1:40:08] people you you see God getting these
[1:40:10] children ready for
[1:40:14] something and here we are standing
[1:40:18] getting the fullness of the word because
[1:40:21] I'm G to tell you something you say well
[1:40:23] I I need it deeper let me tell you
[1:40:24] something the deeper the deepest thing
[1:40:26] you could ever have in you is the
[1:40:28] character of
[1:40:29] Christ there'll be things we'll never
[1:40:32] understand until we get over there but
[1:40:34] if you miss the Deep things it's not
[1:40:37] like you said becoming a parot I can
[1:40:39] quote brother brandom I can quote the
[1:40:40] scripture but that means nothing if that
[1:40:42] life is not living amen and that's all
[1:40:45] I'm saying people of God anybody can be
[1:40:47] religious anybody can wear long dresses
[1:40:49] anybody can wear long hair because a lot
[1:40:51] of Cults wear the same thing
[1:40:54] but that ain't it people are shaving
[1:40:57] come on somebody who can look as well as
[1:40:58] the
[1:41:00] Mormons they come out looking
[1:41:02] clean but but that ain't it it's Christ
[1:41:06] it's the Holy Ghost in
[1:41:08] you and that's what that's what matters
[1:41:11] how can you say you got the Holy Ghost
[1:41:13] and ain't no joy in your life somewhere
[1:41:15] you're not in his presence because the
[1:41:17] Bible said in the presence of the Lord
[1:41:19] there's fullness of joy there is no way
[1:41:22] you can say I'm in Christ and there is
[1:41:25] no joy amen if I'm in the claps of the
[1:41:28] rock the storm is not affecting me cuz
[1:41:31] I'm here in
[1:41:33] Christ and that's all I'm trying to say
[1:41:36] don't build this illusion around your
[1:41:38] world making a a world that doesn't
[1:41:40] exist reality is what we're looking for
[1:41:43] it is the only way you're going to grow
[1:41:45] out of this thing that Satan has locked
[1:41:47] you into some religious
[1:41:51] illusion you better have a reality in
[1:41:53] your life and it's got to be God in you
[1:41:55] and I don't care how so many people who
[1:41:58] can you know that's what all I say is
[1:41:59] this listen nothing wrong with quoting
[1:42:01] him and all that but listen what good is
[1:42:03] that going to do if the life of Jesus
[1:42:05] Christ is not in
[1:42:08] you brother brand said it like this and
[1:42:11] I'm closing for real he said if you
[1:42:14] don't get
[1:42:15] desperate it's going to pass right
[1:42:17] through
[1:42:20] you and if there be a time to be
[1:42:22] desperate it's this time cuz you can see
[1:42:24] the flood waters coming your way am I
[1:42:27] the only one you can see this thing
[1:42:29] coming your way can't you see it coming
[1:42:30] your way it's coming this whole flood
[1:42:33] thing is headed toward the bride because
[1:42:35] you're the only one that's going to
[1:42:36] fully be rebellious you're the rebels of
[1:42:39] the age you're the Martin Luther you're
[1:42:42] the
[1:42:43] westons come on somebody you're the
[1:42:45] William Brams you're the ones who who
[1:42:47] Who's who's standing against not only
[1:42:49] just the church system but the political
[1:42:52] system that's literally all wrong and
[1:42:54] corrupt you're the
[1:42:57] one and God has ordained you to do that
[1:43:00] now what you going to do with it are you
[1:43:02] prepared are you prepared one thing our
[1:43:06] president say this is a time of change
[1:43:08] he caught the
[1:43:10] inspiration he caught the inspiration
[1:43:12] but look what kind of change he bringing
[1:43:15] versus the kind that God trying to bring
[1:43:16] to
[1:43:17] you you love God let's pray our gracious
[1:43:21] Heavenly Father God I pray father that
[1:43:24] you would have mercy upon our souls I

[1:43:45] this morning but Lord God it is the hour
[1:43:48] that we're living in where nothing
[1:43:50] matters but your character father way

[1:44:11] circumstances is what we must learn and
[1:44:14] yield ourselves to do Lord I pray father
[1:44:17] God that you grant us death to ourselves
[1:44:20] that we might die out to ourselves
[1:44:23] father God I ask these things in Your
[1:44:25] Name Lord Jesus Christ be merciful to us
