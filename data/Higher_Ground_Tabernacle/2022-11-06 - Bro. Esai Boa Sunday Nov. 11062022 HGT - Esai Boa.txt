Epistle of Paul to the the Corinthians it's a second Corinthians chapter 10. verse 4 and verse 5. before we read this let's let's say a word of Prayer Lord our heavenly father now is your time we need your presence we don't need man speech but we just need your word only bless the word that we're going to read let the spirits that's in in this word let that Spirits have an effect in us let it give healing to those who need it bring the backslider home and let it save the lost ones we submitted submitted for your own glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our God amen amen Corinthians chapter 10. starting verse 4. yep for the weapons of our Warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds we destroy arguments in every lofty opinions raised against the knowledge of God and take every thought captive to obey Christ in your opinions may the Lord blesses the word that we just read you can regain your seat thank you I think every one of you for listening to the word of God sitting here and I also thank Brothers I was not supposed to speak this morning brother Isaac brother Isaac was supposed to speak this morning he was supposed to speak this morning now he just told me at midnight that he was not feeling well and that's why he's not with us this morning and I want you to remember him in your prayers so the Lord can strengthen him now I would like to share this little topic called let's um let's destroy all reasonings brother Brown says in the that in the Garden of Eden uh when Eve was in the Garden of Eden with Adam Now Eve started reasoning with the word it brought death that reasoning brought death is now when Eve started doubting of the word of God [Music] that's what brought death to the human race [Music] and everything and it brought everything we have is suffering today and that was only because one person doubted the word and that's why Brethren says in the message the testimony of Jesus Christ preached in in 1953 he says in paragraph 11. if a man is born of the spirit of God he doesn't listen to reasonings at all God cannot be reasoned you believe God God is believed you don't reason with God you don't reason on God but you believe God and brother says we don't know God by theology we don't know God by education we don't know God by reasons but we know God by by faith and it's beyond reasonings amen amen okay there's no education that makes you know Gods Seminary it's not a theology that makes you know God it's not all those things that make you know God but you know God by faith says faith is beyond reason you can't reason but you're sick that's what makes it so real to us believersible yes my brothers yes my brothers and sisters I want to tell you this morning that we don't know God by he says that Faith controls every circumstance no matter how great that circumstance no matter how great difficult Faith Masters all circumstances his vision is it is a vision from foreign foreign [Applause] binoculars [Applause] no my brothers he raised in this end time yes sir yes my brothers now I want you this morning I want you to see yourself did you see yourself as a man a Christian of a good reputation you don't have anything to do with that [Applause] he doesn't look at your circumstances miss my brothers and sisters brother Brown says and that the Lord has revealed that this thing is going to happen you just say it and go forward says don't ask questions see Elementary Masters all circumstances Faith believes that God will bring that thing through yeah I don't know the only question you can ask yourself is that I don't know how it's going to happen we know that God will bring it through he received them as a person coming from the dead because based on all circumstances based on all events Abraham could never ever hope to have ice that's why the Bible says as a person coming from the dead and just go forward that's what I want you to do this morning if you ask yourself questions if you start reasoning I'll bring you to a place where your reasoning will stop when Joshua found himself in front of the the walls of Jericho yes I want you to explain to me how how is it going to be with a scientific system how is it that just going turn going around that the wall will fall they're not kernels that's our weapon just because the people of Israel turned around seven times that wall there is now horses could have gone around that wall now just think how how uh how wide it was the wall was it was great but the power of God look at how wide was the Wall Street go around the world never never he only believes he did what God told him to do my brothers I can tell you to do something don't look at what somebody else look at what God told you he will fulfill his word amen amen now listen to this throw my number dude in the sermon don't lean do not lean unto your own understanding go home to it he says in paragraph 48 . in paragraph 148 . it says what would have happened if Moses leaned unto his own understanding when God told him that he would go down to Egypt or the children of Israel from the end of Affairs what would have happened if Moses leaned unto his own understanding when he was there on fire go and I'll be with you what would have happened if you were there in that time what would you have said Moses why all his noise God told Moses to tell other people of Israel stand still and see okay Deliverance that the Lord will give you this day brother Brandon says maybe Moses never even saw a vision before saying that he's gone that's when he gets into the scene [Applause] [Music] [Applause] intestine [Applause] that same power came down and it said foreign [Applause] [Applause] I give you life again tell me how that was possible [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] in the book of Exodus he explodes in the book of Exodus first part in the slides uh in 1955. but he says all of that is just a a thunder with no with no power but I'm I'm giving you an assurance that when Jesus Christ had known to you pray for free you're not made of materials that can go away in the slides that's why Moses could not run away from face because he was anointed the anointing that's why he could not run away well maybe you didn't understand when Jesus Christ anoints you material for free you're not made of materials that can run away I believe that this should raise you up because being anointed no matter what the devil can show you we can't run away we are made of materials that cannot run because everything the devil is the devil is just a thunder with no power is a liar everything he does is lying okay amen Hallelujah I'm happy this morning to find myself standing in front of the anointed Church of God brother Brown says again that the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to remove all everything that says when it comes to live in your hearts it brings your heart to believe that I can do it everything the devil makes you that makes you say but when the Holy Ghost comes to living and so that you can say I can I can I don't know how sit down in 2007 I was sleeping yes the Lord showed me that I would live in the in the United States in 2007. I only met my wife five years later the Lord showed me that I would live in in the United States when I woke up I told my father I told my father this is what I saw this night the Lord showed me that I will live in in the United States and that I would receive you in my house I will make I will make you visit all the churches that you'll go sit down it was in 2007. in 2012 I met my wife with no hope that we could even get married and before I married I asked God a sign I asked Lord I don't want to go into this thing is knowing where I stand but I just need to have an absolute in whatever I'm doing and I told God one day I feel like I love this girl without having her tell me that she loves me with nothing showing that I would marry her once I usually don't tell talk about my personal stories but I want the story to help somebody because we also have young people that want that are aspire to get married so it can always help somebody now one day I pray I said Lawrence it's been long that I've seen things in dreams and sometimes sometimes I don't need a dream I'm not looking for anything else I just won and forget about her now when she got in my heart started beating [Applause] I saw her come in and then she sat down I said to myself whether the devil whether the devil likes it or not I will marry this girl and that's how things happen and a year later I heard that she was traveling to go in America then I was like I was like is this the way God made predestinated things to happen then I waited for all those years that she left puts the shores mockeries uh critic critics but I had one thing on me I was fixing my eyes on the objective that God showed me and I'm right here standing it's just so you can see when God your neighbor says it doesn't matter to you [Applause] they'll always be there those people will always be there if the devil tempted the Lord Jesus Christ himself the devil the Bible says the devil raise Jesus Christ they put him on a mountain not that Jesus Christ I don't know if you understand this now that he just took him took him the mountain he brought him on the on on the top of the table and he told him you're a Son of God throw yourself down there now what can the devil not do to you he will come certainly the devil will be following us he will follow you he will chase you every day because you're not his children and he will not play with you the principle the goal of the devil is to destroy him God Jesus told people yeah Peter certainly see that's nice the devil claimed you know he wanted he wanted to uh to to to to to sift you but I prayed for you [Applause] [Applause] because it's only the devil that came to use him now I want to say this before closing brother Brennan says that the biggest curse is to not know who you are foreign I don't know if you've ever heard this before in the water um ever present in uh he says that the children of God is if it was not controlled by the the the faith they would have created another world and they would have lived their present life there in the ever-present water I believe that it's a strong statement now we you don't don't neglect you have to recognize your place and for what God called you foreign [Music] [Applause] and all those things right there now listen to this foreign here in Jeffersonville and where you're listening to those tapes do you know where you stand said do you know that you have been called by God that the Holy Ghost lives in your heart and every word of God is real to you oh brother how is Satan going to stand again if God is called if you know where you stand said took her do you know that you you have been called [Applause] and that every word of God if it is true how will Satan stand against that no Satan no Satan cannot stand [Applause] and now in the last days with every seed sowed now I stopped it a little bit right there now I want to start again so you can understand he says whatever you do you do so they they were wrong they put they said they put them in in in the Lions they were caught in pieces he's talking about the children of goddesses by all kinds of ways they were killed now he says you can't kill it no matter how much they kill the Saints but they could never killed the power that were in the Saints you can't kill it well yeah [Music] the church that's predestinated those who he foreign glorified it's not a man who comes and this morning where are those binoculars don't look at the present time but look at the end and see yourself as a prediction see yourself as a glorified ability to see yourself as a cold no matter what the circumstances are yeah in the last days with every seed sold now it's our day every seed sowed everything in order the world in its order the time shaped up why the church in its in its order the church is in her position I want you to recognize your position because the church is already in her position don't don't live in the past Believe In The Presence where the church knows her position every believer knows his position ability he says the evening lights the seed less and the signs like he said as it was in the days of Sodom an angel of God came the Holy Spirit coming down performing the signs [Music] he says amen five times he says do you love it [Applause] [Applause] be careful be careful be careful Let's Dance may God bless you
