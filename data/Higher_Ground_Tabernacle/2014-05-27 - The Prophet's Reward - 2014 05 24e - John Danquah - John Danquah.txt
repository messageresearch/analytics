========================================
what an atmosphere tonight what a presence tonight what a joy in our souls presence of the Holy Spirit when Praises go up blessings come down may God heal our sick bodies amen amen may he come and give us that joy that is unspeakable full of Glory oh blessed be the name of the Lord shall we pray there is no place Lord that your children will gather and to be in your arest presence Lord to worship that omnipresent your omnicient and the omnipotent God same yesterday today and forever The God Who answer us by fire the heavens is thy throne and the Earth is thy full stone who can be compared unto thee among the gods who can be compared unto thee you who created the universe out of Nothing by Your Word you spoke the world into existence we are so grateful that you have revealed yourself to us you came down lord to die to reconcile us back onto you we thank you Father above all thank you Lord you had us in your mind and you came forward Lord to redeem them that you heart in your mind and we can see ourselves Lord at the redeem of the Lord let the redeem of the Lord say so amen give you glory for this morning's message Lord for your son who yielded himself to you and you use him Lord Jesus to bring our conditions of how the King David when he had nothing he depended upon you and Lord when you give him too much he relaxed not to get himself into battle and Lord if we are slumbering and we are sleeping wake us up Lord Lord put us back into your business let every home every brother every sister every Ministry Lord watch and and pray because the hour is so late Lord the enemy was so mad took his phone away we can't find it Lord but we pray but we come together as a body one more time Lord there was a time when somebody's car was stolen and we took the prophet took the matter before God in prayer and they had to leave it somewhere else Lord the same God is here and Lord we bring the form before you Lord I will find this to your honor and Glory we thank you for the brothers who have traveled to come down to be with us my long time friends longtime Brothers some of them have not seen for over 20 something years but by your grace you brought us together again what can we say but to say Thank You Lord you bless the pastor of this church Lord and but a warn as well Lord the Believers here who are here today May their coming not be in vain we love you in Jesus name my precious wife and children the church back home I commit them all into your hands as well and I ask that you will bless them in Jesus name we pray amen how many were blessed this morning I was tremendously blessed thank you brother Matthew God Rich bless you for that message amen don't worry I'm going to take your thoughts yes I'm going to take some good nuggets out of that bled be the name of the Lord you know the 54 Ministry is a blessing and any church that is robbing them of that you're robbing your own self of what you need we need Ministries like this amen amen to come in the Fireballs of God Amen and begin to get you in an atmosphere where you can draw yourself closer to God last night tonight we spoke about the servant of God and supper time we're able to identify that this is the end time is the supper time it's not a breakfast message or a lunch message supper time is Rapture time as a matter of fact it's called as Jubilee time is supper time because that's when the whole families come back together and they sorry and they rejoice amen so we are in Jubilee now but because of the way the enemy as our brother was talking Satan's tactics is so true I want to follow his thoughts on the prophet Nathan and take us into the word because the enemy knows that a prophet is an A A A Light Of God that God sent to a people and when the people reject the prophet they Pro they perish because God has an order of doing things so let's take our scriptures today to the Book of Matthew chapter 10 and verse 41 we'll read 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 20 Matthew chapter 10 and verse 41 if Nathan was not in David's life David would have been living in sin he would have been a murderer he would have Justified himself that he was doing right and he have been condemned unto death but but David having Nathan was a blessing amen you can read from vers 39 down but I just want to take verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward verse 42 says and whosoever shall give to drink onto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciples very I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward even a common glass of cold water given to somebody in the name of a disciple will receive a reward oh my 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and: 20 after that you may have the comfort of your seat whilst I remain standing praise the name of the Lord and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tcoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper Hallelujah if you want to be established have faith in God if you want to prosper believe the prophet glory be to God Amen Jehoshaphat is going to battle he spoke about the ammonites or the people of on and they were gathered together to fight Israel he got to give the people confidence in God and the prophet's word you know what he did he assembled the musicians and brought the singers that you go forth in praising God let a battle begin with praises and I believe I believe the holy ghost sang tonight and I believe the battle sat has been defeated because when the people of God come together to pray and to worship why the devil coming down in the midst of holy ghost singing he has to depart and while they were singing God confounded the enemy until they began fighting among themselves and they destroyed themselves that when the Army went there the job was already done hallelujah oh and I believe that the singing tonight the song leader was in in tune the pastor was in tune because the word came forth in power this morning Hallelujah everybody have been tuned up and I think I'm ready to deliver amen we see the church Brother Scott God bless you how you doing amen bless be now for um a subject I just want to preach on the Prophet reward and for a contest a friend of God they asked brother Bram a question said brother brandham what is a prophet's reward in COD but I was thinking that the prophet is going to give me some big jewelry or you know some big stone or some kind of a artifact he said they want to know what a prophet reward is say a prophet reward is to be a friend of the proph it said thus a reward just like the shite brother that began to set me going on some things that we want to discuss today I believe it's going to be a blessing to us because everything we do in life the reward matters our reward tells us that we have been either been appreciative or not whether we receive it or not a reward that you get give you the notion that what you were striving for you've achieved beli it and I believe that every one of us here want a reward from the heavenly father amen every Church Aid begins with announcement but it always ends with the Overcomers to receive a reward amen I believe that in laia the reward that God gave was that he will grant us to sit with him on his throne as the as he overcame and sat with the father on his throne Hallelujah he is making us join her with him on the throne and and for you to be able to sit on the throne with Jesus you got to be his wife now many run a race and athletes run a race there are many many events taking place upon the face of the world some want to win the Stanley Cup some want to win the World Series some all kinds of things to get a reward Earthly but you know the joy that they get when they finish all that there's a parade going on and uh with rivalries and drinking and everything but the people are happy because they fought hard and they have been rewarded by winning can you imagine we finish this race and we got over there oh my it will be worth it all for all the trials we've gone through and the battles we' fought and all the things said it to be wanted all to know that we finally made it what about a man that's striving prepares for the Olympics and then the day of the race for some reason he's running and he quits halfway not only is he not going to get a reward he's disqualified it means that all the exercises and the money is time wased I believe tonight we're not going to waste our time as Christians but we here to put in all our resources to finish this race with the final age so a friend of a prophet according toam is a reward let me take uh 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 20 and see jehoshaphat's uh sorry uh 2 Chronicles 20: 7 jehoshaphat's prayer before they went into the battle look at what he said here vers 6 of verse 5 and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court I love this King this King did everything that seemed to be right in the sight of God he loved God and as Believers we should love God with everything we have amen and he said oh Lord God of our fathers oh and not thou th God in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in thy hand is there not power a might so that none is able to withstand thee and not thou Our God who did drive out inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever nobody has addressed Abraham as a friend of God but J for the Revelation mother Abraham was just not a servant of God but he pleased God so much he became a friend of God brother that's a reward he said here because Abraham is your friend you the promises are to Abraham's seed of which I am a Seed of Abraham Hallelujah and therefore every promise God gave Abraham the Seed of Abraham would take promise and every promise in the word once we know who a prophet is and we can receive that prophet in the name of a prophet every promise that God gave the prophet is our reward not only him Isaiah 41:8 praise God Isaiah 41:8 but thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend Jehoshaphat said Abraham was his friend Isaiah is saying that Abraham is the friend of god let's see what James says James chapter 2 verse 23 Hallelujah and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God blessed be the name of the Lord the man believe God so much that he became a friend of God that's a reward now let me read James 4 and verse four for another contrasts before we continue ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God so my question to you is whose friend are you it's as simple as this if you're a friend of the world you are God's enemy when Abraham heard God's voice and God told him come out of your country your Kindred your people get out of Canada America don't think the way Americans think come into my own land and he did that he was not a friend of the world any longer and if he's not a friend of the world he has to be a friend of the one that called him and church we have left the world we have left denomination we've left organization we have come back to God's Own friendship let me take John chapter 3 and verse 29 blessed be the name of the Lord he that has the bride is the bridegroom and of course if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ I said if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ then he is the bridegroom you are his bride amen Amen brother when the love of Jesus Christ is coming to a believer's heart it is God's love to you he love you we uh he that have the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him Rejoice that greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled so John the Baptist is saying that he is the friend of the bridegroom but you see prophetically this is the hour of the calling of the bride and therefore a Ministry a type of John the Baptist Elijah anointing yeah is to come back in this same time as a friend of God we need somebody that God can talk little ear with when he hear the bridegroom's voice he rejoiceth the wise virgins behold the bridegroom cometh he had a voice he rejoiced over it and church we need to have the joy of God in our hearts Hallelujah let's take the scriptures in uh John chapter 15 for a second John 15 I'll start from vers 9 as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love brothers and sisters this message is all about the love of God it's all about the love of Jesus Christ amen and if God has not revealed that to you sorry you you need to have a taste of the love of God Amen that surpasses all understanding am amen if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my co my father's Commandments and abide in his love now the Commandments of God are not Grievous Jesus said he kept them amen and he remain or abided in his love you ever seen a covenant that people can't keep and they still want to talk about the love of God but we are in a covenant in the marriage amen we got to keep it amen praise the name of the Lord these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full the love of God bring the joy of God we should never be stressed becoming Christians we should not be stressed coming to church the joy of the Lord is our strength I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord are you glad today are you happy to be here the joy of God must ra your heart glory be to God Amen this is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you take with me quickly to John 34 just John 334 quickly we'll come back to that scripture don't don't don't don't close it John 13:34 what this a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another a new commandment butam calls it the 11th commandment Hallelujah it said that is Love Will Conquer anything you know sometimes we look at Faith as a big thing here's a prophet walking through a field he stumbles over a killer Boo and the buo gets angry well if it were you and me where's my shortgun I will just teach you a lesson and blow your head off and keep quiet he goes and the prophet is going to apologize what the way to conquer the enemy sorry kabu I invaded your Terror I'm a servant of the Lord but I'm sorry why a prophet can say sorry to an animal we can say sorry to one another so I'm so sorry am that I intruded in your territory and the bull had the voice of the Prophet why don't you go back and relax let me go do my business and the boot end from being a killer to a nice tame Bull and went they sat where he was because the prophet knew how to approach an Angry Boo the next time was some Hornets he stumbled over them you could have taken some kind of a fire and then sprad all of them to death I'm so sorry creatures of God that are bouncing into your hand and I Disturbed you he said sorry now humility and love move mountains that's what we are lucky we are too proud in the message God help us to Humble us that will be able to be Sons and Daughters of God with the love of God that comes with humility imagine people that want to move mountains that they can't have patience and love you want to been T put anointing down and you don't know how to love let's continue vers 13 greater love has no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends Jesus laid down his life for his friends let's see one scripture that talks about uh John 10 and 11 just quickly we're going to come back there again John 10 and: 11 it says here I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep but he that is an Hing and not the shepherd who own the Sheep are not see the wolf coming and leave the sheep and flee and the Wolf catches them and Scatter the Sheep the hiring fleeth because he is UN hiring and careth not for the Sheep I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and I'm none of mine Hallelujah and right now I see the wolf coming they try to get a hold of the Sheep and true Shepherds will not leave the flock they will be there to guard them with a Shepherd amen or the door post making sure that all the strange doctrine that are coming will not infiltrate the church amen hallelujah if you're hiring you just release everything to go but God never called us to be hirings church amen another scripture I believe in uh Romans chap 5 and: 7 let's turn that script quickly and we come back to John 15 again Romans 5 and verse 7 now look at this it said greater love has no man than this that a man should lay down his life for his friend Paul says here that for scarcely for a righteous man will one die if a righteous man scarcely will somebody die for a righteous man are you with me yet per adventure for a good man some will even dare to die but God commanded his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died Jesus did not wait for you to be good for him to go to Calvary but while you were smoking while you were drinking why you were a sinner why you never knew him he went to the cross and he died for you that he would change you into his own image and likeness but he loved you when you were unlovable he loved you when you had no hope he loved you when you were finished he never came to serve the righteous he came to serve the Sinners to bring onto repentance that is the love of God yes sir Hallelujah maybe somebody is here you think I have a baggage but John I have I have dug something so bad and tell me what what more can Jesus do than what he did on Calvary you know your problem is this you don't have enough faith in him yeah yeah because if he says in his word that for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him will not perish but have eternal life that is the word you have to believe that so he came to die for his friends scarcely for righteous man will you die for let alone a friend let's go back to John 15 Hallelujah vers 14 he laid down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you Hallelujah listen to me carefully a prophec reward is to be afraid of the Prophet butam says and Jesus here is saying that you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you are you with me Church the word of God is what you obey and when you obey the word the word becomes a command to you and once you obey in that word he gave you that word he gave you you are his friend Abraham staggered not at the promise of God that's why was a friend of God hallelujah amen and as I said I see the problem with the people on the internet if if you have internet pastors change them please and have live Ministries to bless your heart are you the church amen you you you you got a God where you PA him when you want in your pajamas you are in church Sunday morning you have not even brushed your teeth in your pajamas on your bed I feel so good I'm in church you you lazy brother ye are my friends if you do my whatsoever I command you henceforth or from now on from today onwards I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth so Jesus to make the disciples friends he has to change their status he had to change your thinking he has to remove you from a church to a bride amen he had to change your position from servant to Friendship because if you're a servant you don't know what your lord doeth and if Jesus has to reveal the word to the disciples he cannot put them on the status of servants amen but we refuse to be any man's servant you never heard me I said we refuse to be any man's servants henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knowth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you tell me how how many people will talk to their servants about Family Matters you will not reveal secrets to servants because you look at them like this you are up here they are up there for them to know the things you got to elevate them to a status of trust amen where you'll be able to sit down have a chat with them have a talk with them servants you keep them somewhere far away from you are you the church amen now why is Brother John saying this because in Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 17 God had to change Abraham from a servant to a friend amen and then he said he came down God I said God came down yeah amen and the purpose why he came down was because the world is going to be destroyed but he cannot do that if his friend is taking on a so he comes to him shall I hide anything for my friend the word is about to be busted but can the god hide anything from the bride no he has to reveal the secret to the bride he came to Abraham the world don't know what it's about to do but the prophet has to what he's about to do and so God sat out with him and he said listen you see there two angels who have come down he say yes they have a message to go to Sodom they say yeah the iniquity of Sodom has reach me and we've come to investigate to destroy it say oh Lord if I can get yeah maybe 50 righteous people in that City Lord will you spare the city of Sodom said Abraham all right you want 50 righteous people give them to me now I know I know you be saying that Abraham where did you count to know that there are no 50 righteous does Abraham know that the man talking to him knows everybody Abraham know that's God himself he knows that Elohim Tabernacle with him so what he said 50 righteous give them to me everyone did not question he didn't know to go go back and and count anybody unlike today they want to analyze the prophet every statement should be analyzed you are unbelievers he said can I get 40 righteous he said 40 you mean what about 30 Abra give them to me what about 20 keep on going Abraham I'll take 20 I'll SP a city it's a l 10 brother then he began to realize that this is serious business you know after God Abram asked God about six questions he said these six seals have just shown what is about to happen in the world and everything else but now let's forget about that let's talk about Sarah right now the seven seal is to the bread of Jesus Christ to show your identity Who You Are hallah because the seven seal is about the coming of Isaac it's about the coming of Christ all right Sarah your wife is going to conceive and she's going to have a child she was at the back of the room somewhere else when she heard that she said there they go again I have been Liv in This Promise of is coming for 24 years all of a sudden look at my age right now when I was young I thought I could I brought ishma in I had a mess now they come to talk again about a baby she laughed but as she laughed and I think sometimes we laugh at the promise of God sometimes even as the bre of Jesus Christ Our doubt take us into Realms that we we you know it look like it can be done it cannot be done but God still rich in [Music] Mercy in Mercy and then go with a back turn to the congregation Abraham he said yes why did Sarah laugh how did he know that that's why could not question him you see he say Sarah yes my Lord why did you laugh oh I did not Sarah was making God a liar brother Bram says that she would have been killed she would have had to die it said but if God should destroy her where is the promise the promise got to come through her oh chch talk about the grace of God that a promise got to come through you and sometimes in our mistakes God has to override it he had to forgive us why because of his friend [Applause] [Music] if not for Abraham should have been destroyed and I said this to you if not for the prophet of God for this age would have been done but thank God for the [Music] wordu it was about the coming of Isaac it said a year by this time according to the time of life I will visit you and Sarah thy wife will have a child Abraham said he believed you see the Bible says that Abraham believed God it was imputed unto him for righteousness he was called a friend of God the Bible say he did not stagger but you want me to show you a few things that look like Abraham staggered so it depends on what you see about me Matthew am about Pastor Hallelujah you can have a lot of to stagger you but the Bible said Abraham did not Stager let me show you a few Abraham one day came and Sarah said my Lord say yes honey uh since you've been telling me that you've been hearing the voice of God I've never question you but you see people are making mockery of us since you ever said you're going to have a child look at the stars look don't sleep look at the bockery about the Rapture coming you see that Egyptian lady I think she'll be a wonderful girl let I have the baby I will take the child and I will Nest the baby Abraham should have gone to God but he listened to the wife and you know sometimes when the pressure come from the church we K in and produce a wild child and that child is our trouble today we are not free because he was a child of the flesh amen there's no spiritual calling about is's life amen God watch him you know from Genesis 13 after Ishmael came God never spoke to Abraham for about 13 years there were silence years until the trouble started in the home when hagga and and and Sarah were having trouble in Abraham's Church Abraham's church was having fight when two churches are are fighting who suffers the grass but Sarah knew her mistake he say I brought this strange Doctrine and I said pay the strange Doctrine out amen let's fix it am take him out and sah will not barge because this seed will not be heard with a shark and I believe so many Israelites have come in a message it's time for them to leave they cannot stay with us they're not part of the promise they have to go amen and then when he came there Abraham was trying to play Mr nice man no no no no no no no no no no no Sarah I want her I I want the boy to stay the boy is making fun of Sarah calling her oh lady call you all kind of names Sarah can't take that he guy says com in the church with arrogancy have no respect no respect for for for for Sarah any longer Sarah said you know what we got to put the church right I cause the mess and I'll fix it and sometime when we C the mess we got to fre the mess to ca don't blame anybody for your mistake blame your for [Applause] it and then God said Abraham now listen to me carefully she called the mess but she's willing to make it right if you don't even listen to her even your prayers will be hindered and you know sometimes church when we treat the church so bad sometimes how we going to pray for God for the people that will claim we love when a man treat his wife like garbage you know he can no respect for his wife how is God hearing your prayers amen so isma had to leave and and he left and then now Abraham God appeared to him again he came back the next time the Revelation he brought oh Lord um I'm dying old without a child maybe this elasa of Damascus will be the heir you mean God said Abraham I never said I'll bring you elezar you talk about staggering they are they are staggering because brother Bram said 1977 you're staggering about that that's your problem huh you staggering because he took hagga that's your problem God don't look at that you see he said no elazar would not be the one but out of your own Longs oh my maybe you said and say brother John I'm not good enough for the Rapture brother John there's nothing good in me I'm making all kinds of mistakes I do understand brother but that mistake is something the enemy is throwing a death or D at you look at the promise of God because you you can't fix your past the way you want to fix it amen just move away from it believe God repent of it and move on forgetting about the things of the past let's move forward to the price of the high calling in Christ Jesus so now after Abraham has gone through elazar gone through Ishmael he staggered the Lord but God come back and the promise word say that he never staggered was a Believer he says Sarah be prepared a year by this time the baby is coming all of a sudden but tell USS that something takes place it said watch something takes place he said just before the baby has to come Hallelujah that baby cannot be born in an old V WR body amen God had to give Abraham a new body Sarah a new body this all V bodies cannot produce Christ it has to die it had to be changed for Christ to come Hallelujah so you know what God did to prove to prove that the bodies was changed something must take place for you to believe that the body was changed now who want to fall in love with Grandma 90 years tell me any S young man that desires to marry a 90y old grandma and I'll tell you where your head is but AB did Sir not an ordinary man a king a whole king of a Nation woo it says all the women of of this city there has never been a beauty produce like this who is this girl even you call a woman you know who is this girl oh he's here with a brother oh so that man is his husband no no no no no no how do you find out she told me because Abraham said Sarah God has done something so good and and and right now the beauty you have produced my life is in danger I know this man are going to come after you he's a prophet he know what is coming so when they ask you remember that you are my half sister we are the same father eh just tell them that I am your brother said I kept it who is the man by my brother oh you brother here we are the same father oh that's good the king would like to see you all right and she goes and the King says listen you so beautiful I just love you you mind this kingdom is going to be yours um will you accept my hand in marriage and and you know we're going to get R and everything going I don't know whether answered that but you know in those days you have no choice anyway so the king went ahead and proclaimed his wedding plans and and everything invited the Kings everybody else we are coming and I believe Abraham he didn't worry because God would take care of his word he never went to frez and tried to break things now he knew if God called him if God gave it a promise God can never allowed the promise to come to pass to fail the promise will come to pass but will never fail ABC was sleeping Abram was ABR never talked to him he had a dream God said wake up wedding plans cancelled they say to today Jubilee time don't don't I'm thinking of how to enjoy enjoy my new bride he say you are a dead man we are talking about living things here today not dead things wake up you are a dead man so why let me warn you if you even touch that woman you are finished this is the choice I give you your kingdom will be done your seed will not be there no more your car will be dead your land will be Barren if you touch the woman and let me said this to those who are coming against the bread of Jesus Christ and call us names if they are not very careful their spiritual life is dried up it will affect their children affect everything they have except they behave like abik he said but didn't she tell me that the man was said brother I don't care what she told you I am telling you what I'm telling you and so many time he said she said he said she said what do God's wory about it I'm not worried about what she told you I'm not worried about what a man said I'm worried about what I'm telling you to do cancel the wedding okay I thought they told me said if I'm a man of integrity if you're a man of integrity obey my word amen by the way as you approach him go very very softly and tactfully ask him to pray for you respect him don't go and accuse him ask him to pray for you because he's my Prophet up until that time we never knew but God in that condition said he is my Prophet brother you can show me all the kind of mistakes you want show about my Prophet I know one thing that God has already Vindicated him you can show the Stager you want to show everything that make you look at he's a liar he said this he said that but God says he is my Prophet blessed be the name of the Lord you know go said Prophet don't make mistakes then be he made a mistake we don't have to fear Him and fear him because made so mistake Abraham did too much yeah yeah even had an ishmail gave his wife away Propet never did that amen and woke up in the morning and said the wedding is called of tell the king of this thing that there's no more wedding so what's the matter oh no no we change plans plans have changed and I could see God saying I give the man everything he wants he carry goods and everything he come said prophet Abraham I have brought your wife back to you brother Bram said Genesis 21 Sarah was with Abraham it said from vers 2 to vers 6 Sarah was in the hands of another man it said vers s God said restore the man his wife he said the first church age the bride was with church but for the second Church age she was in the hands of organization but at the end time the seven verse restored B position said we are restored people the same Sarah not Place one we are a continuation of the book of Acts to God and Sarah came back to Abraham and Abraham knew his wife and she conceived and she bought Isaac he said I'll call him Isaac because I'm laughing you know why she laugh she had been grieving for a long time War about this thing for a long time but one day God will turn your weeping into laughter one day your Darkness will become light amen the sorrow will become Joy there that we in the night shall s or reap in the morning say joy in the morning rather he was a friend of God God could not keep the secret away from him he revealed a secret to him because he was his friend are you the church and the bridegroom has a friend the friend hears The brid Voice he gave him the secret the Midnight Cry arise and trim your Lambs the BR gr cometh the message of the hour is to prepare the Believers for the coming of Christ amen a prophet reward like the shunamite but brandham says Elijah had destroyed the 400 bad Prophets what a powerful Ministry killed all of them destroyed their groups when jezeb heard it she got mad wherever Elijah is I'm looking for him to destroy him until the Prophet Elijah had to run and go hide in the cave you know sometimes when you fought a battle you fought a battle you get to a point where sometime you think there's nobody with you but there are believers everywhere who still believe the message the internet cannot destroy the message because we knew the message before internet came Hallelujah he was in a cave do look like sa to you that it look like a green meal area to you somewhere in a cave and then the angel of the Lord came and spoke they said Elijah get up get some cake and get some water and drink he said on told up I'm going to let Ravens feed you Ravens are takers but I will allow them to feed you you know sometime God allow us to work for the Ravens you know the government they Tak they want your taxes everything they do they just want your money but God allowed us you know for them to feed us thank you Lord but the time came When God says now the Ravens are not coming again the pressure is hard but get up and go to a city of zarapa there you meet a widow woman he never sent him to the home of the rich sir he never sent him to the home of those who don't need him he sent him to a woman whose Last Hope was death waited upon here and her child and he goes and sees a woman coming at a widow and goes will you please give me some water to drink and by the way when you bring in the water bring some cake for me as well oh sir today is a day ah we are left that last muscle once I finish this meal there'll be no food for for us to eat we have to wait for death it's the last we have once I give that to you is finished Elisha said or Elijah he said go and do what I said if it were you today the pastor has no love I need to pay my rent and he want me to pay his TI if God call him God will feed him amen I'm gone that was not her attitude because if I eat this I'm going to die anyhow so let me invest in something amen that faith can back it and let me say this to church we've come to the last R the pale horse rider has death over him the whole land is full of death let's invest and give all we have for the ministry of Elijah amen and then she went and I could see him needing that loaf of bread and say I owe it all to Jesus I owe it all to Jesus if I have anything all a praise to him I give as she was just needing that bread with love and happiness and joy brought it up Sir you get this and get your water then Elijah said because you did this because you obeyed the cruise of oil will never run dry in your home Hallelujah the flower go back it's multiplying you never going to run dry out of it I check because she took the prophet's word the prophet said she became a friend because she took the word look at Jesus Christ in John 11:11 just watch that would go when death come to your home what you need to do these things said he and after that he said unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do well how be Jesus spoke of his death but the thought that he has spoken of taking of rest in sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent he may believe nevertheless let us go unto him a man is dead and you say you are glad huh the brother is dead and you say you are glad so I'm glad that I was not there that you will believe because something going to take place but watch the story Lazarus Martha and Mary have opened their home for Jesus to come and rest it is said by the commentators that Jesus took that home as his own home that any time he goes and is tired he goes down there Mary and Martha they are ready to serve Jesus they saw too much and then Jesus told them when he knew death was coming he left as soon as he left sickness hit a home I tell the Devil is a wicked man he knows when Jesus is around he can't do nothing he waits when you look like he's away he want to strike Martha sent a message Lord Lazaro is sick Jesus did not reply the next message came Lazarus is dead Jesus did not reply the next message Lazarus is buried after 4 days he say l let's go let's go but you tell me what will your attitude be you be honest to yourself if you're pastor but but Matthew amen but want you called them to come and pray for you they didn't show up and then you dead he didn't come to your funeral after 4 days he shows up in your house what will you tell him away away our away we had enough let me bury my dead go but that was not the attitude of matter as soon as she saw Jesus coming she said Master Lord if you were only here my brother would have not dieded if you were here and Jesus look unto her and says if I'm only here I'm here he says he that believeth in me though he was dead yes shall he live amen matter goes Lord I know I know I know at the resurrection he said are the resurrection I am the resurrection the resurrection is stting is a person that's why I'm telling you if you have faith to believe me he who is dead will rise now what Jesus was about to do to Lazarus is a type of four days it's a type of the 4,000 years of death that has robbed every human being but now the Savior the resurrected Lord is going to bring death to a close and to show it but the brother said that when he went out they said take off the stones he said they were all crying because Lazarus is dead now they weeping when Jesus came they everybody was crying until Jesus wept for their unbelief roll a stone somebody said what did he say did you know how many days he's been buried he stinking M said just do it I said do it I have stood I've seen the waters T to Wine amen I have seen 10 lepers cleansed amen I have seen too much in my life I cannot doubt him anymore I have seen God use our prophet in so many ways I can never D the message I've seen too much roll the stone roll it amen may God roll our stones of unbelief every stone sealing us from believing God take it away breing the seal off the prophet said when he stood if he had call all the dead to come out they would have all come but he zeroed among the dead and he says Lazarus come forth and he who was dead four days amen came back Hallelujah and by go look at around the world so many dead churches dead people he zero the number of Scot and he call your name you he a voice and you came out of [Applause] it thank you Jesus amen is UN lose him give him food and water and let him walk but you know there were some people called the Pharisees that miracle was not good for them you know what they said by reason of Lazarus Resurrection many are Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ you know what let's kill him back destroy the evidence put him back to death so that we can fill our churches and that's what these brothers are doing they're trying to kill the evidence of the message the cloud is not up here the cloud is there what's your problem yeah we what about day 28 and so what before God does anything on Earth he does in the heavens amen he showed in the heavens already for his servant to know that he's thereo your problem God is God he's real he will do what he need to do amen they're finding problem with the pillar of fire the Halo they're finding problem with everything but they attacking everything everything but we've seen too much you know he opened a blind man but Matthew and the blind man has been in their Church yeah there's not the man is blind for so many years 30 something years Jesus touch his eye the man is singing and the guy is glorifying God and praising God in church oh why are you so loud why why so much amen what is the Joy about the message what is making you like this is said do you know my condition my mother told me trees look green I'm not seeing them and never they yellow flowers and red ones and pink ones and purple oh look at the blue skies I always had oh it got some cloud in them too yeah so excited for the first time see him you would have thought people have been happy that the man is seeing they came to question him who open your eyes yeah yeah A Man Called Jesus what is he I don't know what did he do to you well he asked me to go wash I went and wash and I see Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and then they were angry said but this Jesus that we are hearing is a sinner said oh is that your problem since the world began have you ever SE here The Sinner open the eye of any blind man I said all I know is that one time I was sick but today no more one time I was a sinner Save By Grace once I was a sinner Save By Grace Hallelujah one time I could not see but now I see you can't take this Joy away from [Applause] me they said we know he's the devil you can tell him anything you want but I have the evidence I'm serious so they went and brought a mother and the father is that your son yes was he born blind yes how come he sees he's of age asking in other words when God open your eye to Revelation your father or your mother or your brother cannot defend you you have to defend the message it's a personal revelation God don't have grandchildren we are going on the revelation of the one that revealed the word to [Music] [Applause] us and then the Bible said he was making too much noise in the church that they say you know what take this guy and throw him out because he believe in science and w we can't do that in the church we don't believe it this is an embarrassment so they got rid of him and threw out a supernatural evidence out of the church yeah and the Bible says as soon as they threw him out Jesus was there he said Do You Believe In The Son of God he said who is he that I will believe I'm standing right here it's the Lord I believe amen Believers are believers amen it doesn't matter the stress it doesn't matter the pressure the whole church on one man one man, he stood against the whole councel because God has done something not in your life you can withstand any demon amen oh hallelujah thank you Lord in closing Captain neon was a Syrian Syrian General let's go to First Kings chapter 5 or 2 Kings 5 and3 praise God in closing now second Kings chapter 5 verse one says neon captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was Al a mighty man in veiler but he was a leper what is your strength and might When sin has invaded your life the syrians had gone out by companies and have brought away captives out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on neon's wife she was doing a house uh what do you call it like like a mage servant in the home and she said unto her mistress oh W God my Lord were with a prophet hello I wish my Lord was with a prophet that is in Samaria for he will recover him of his leprosy and one went and told his Lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel think of it a m Serv in the home look at a man who has employed her an honorable man very nice man maybe treated a well with wages and everything when he saw his condition said ah if only he can be identified with the Prophet this leprosy will go believe God you'll be established believe his prophet he will prosper if he can identify himself with a prophet he'll be relieved she was a maid I believe that sister had lived such a Godly life in that home that her word was powerful somebody took the message not even the mistress told the husband somebody the testimony of that girl said if you can only be in Israel or Samaria you'll be fine so he went and told the king and the King wrote a letter and send it to the king of Israel it says I am bringing my captain to you when he comes and you receive him recover him of his leprosy the king of Israel said am I God am I God to deliver a man from leprosy why is this man trying to get me to war you see what he's trying to do confusion was going on and Elisha was there he said hey King King what the problem why why you yelling and shouting what's the problem read the letter he said don't worry bring him to me bring him to me and Captain neon was told to come so he prepared his child and everything he came like a diplomat you know all the horses in front of him and everything he wanted Royal Treatment when he came to the house of Elisha elishah took the just go tell him he should go to Jordan di seven times that's all that's it he did not even come to welcome me you mean to tell me that's your hospitality in Israel does he know who I am I am captain neon commander of the hor of Syria he treat me like that the scripture says let's continue for a moment vers 9 says neon came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the House of Elisha elishah sent a messenger unto him saying go and watch in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shall be clean but neon was rough went away and said behold I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not abana and FAA rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel look at his attitude may I not washing them and be clean so he turned and went away in Rage you are sick you are a sick man and instead of humbling yourself with such an attitude how can God heal you his attitude was wrong he wasn't ready to be healed God has to Humble him first amen he got to come down first he was so high like that because in his mind I did not expect him to tell me to go get myself baptized I want him to speak the word I'll be fine and go home have better denominations in our church better churches in our country better synagogues what is Jordan River oh so he was going back in Rage angry you know some we come to church and I'm telling you our attitude are so appalling you just can't wait to get out of church and go home but God want to deal with you and do something with you so somebody in 13 a servant came near and spoke unto him and said my father look at the respect they even give a man whose attitude is wrong my father if the prophet he is according the office of the prophet he who receive a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet reward amen had B thee do some great thing would thou not have done it if he had told you to give him a million dollars you may have it something great you would have done it and got a credit how much rather than when he says to the wash and be clean I he told you go and wash that's your problem why all these statements that you are making about rivers of Damascus he just says go and wash and you telling him that he thought you would come out and look look at your attitude look at your face look look how ra you are you would have been able to do Mighty things and take the glory for yourself but just go and watch and whoever spoke to him got into his heart and that brother was able to listen to the voice of another servant so he went to the Jordan he said di seven times just just go ahead and do it and brother we have to believe God for the smaller things and let God do the greater things as a beli for the smaller things and let God do the greater things take God at the word and let it do the miracle amen he went the first time Bo he came out saying he went the second time he came out the same every Church age the Saints look like they want to overcome the enemy they come out they go back the same way death was swallowing everybody but see in this seventh age we will defy death yes sir when he K the seventh time the bible say that the lepos left him and the servant walk death where is that Victory amen or death where is that sin grave where is that Victory God has given us a victory through Christ we will overcome we have overcome we shall be changed shall be changed believe God for the small things when Joshua told Israel go March around the city seven times that's all he said believe God for the small things and let him do the greater he marched the first day nothing happened second day nothing mat happened third day nothing happened on the seven day where seven times and the walls came down see when you believe God's word he will do the greater things have faith in God Amen just obey the word and God will do the rest amen church he who receive a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet reward our reward is coming amen and they're trying to take you away from the reward of the Prophet what did God tell him because you are sincere you are believe a huge portion of Heaven are de that's your reward amen church amen when he was C the of time he said the Paul group make it

but Matthew the Lord told him all that you ever loved and all that love you shall be in the Beloved for even loving a prophet of God in the name of a prophet there's a reward to that amen you know that the things that he saw over there that made it this this sounds something that you know you may not understand but I'm not here to question what God want to do he said I saw my dog there I saw my sofa chair there sir I saw my horse there you can interpret any way you want it could be spiritual could be physical all I know is that he say saw now if a horse made it and a suffer made it and a dog

person you TR love a person if if you love a person if they're saying all kind of negative because you love him you still because you love him but but if you don't love a man anything they tell about
