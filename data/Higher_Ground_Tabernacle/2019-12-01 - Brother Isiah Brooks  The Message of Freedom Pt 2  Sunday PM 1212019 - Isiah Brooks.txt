little prayer for brother rich father God we come so that you would help him through whatever he's going through I pray father God that you will just bless him Lord strengthen him Lord and reveal to him whatever he needs to be that needs to be revealed to him Lord in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you love the Lord we had three birthdays today didn't know it I was wondering why he was waiting to wear that suit of his a Keith birthday and the twin boys and the twin boys today their birthdays yeah and now we know he's good at keeping secrets so no reason why he told me today I think because they had already planned to take him somewhere and today not realizing they were gonna take him somewhere I was gonna ask him to take him out to dinner today and that's when I found out it was his birthday so God is good to us amen let us turn by the Word of God we try not to be long we have communion tonight I appreciate everybody who's here I'm gonna go to Deuteronomy just gonna read the 19th verse of that particular chapter Deuteronomy 26 19 and then I think we're going to go to Deuteronomy 12 26 Deuteronomy 26:19 God is good to us enteries and to make the high above all nations which he have made and made in praise and in name and in honor and thou may it be the holy people unto the Lord thy God as he hath spoken now we turn to Deuteronomy 12 26 it's amazing how God in the scripture has about three to four maybe five texts on this kind of calling the people of God a holy priesthood a holy nation and we're gonna read the 12 26 it says only your holy things which you have to offer and what you have vowed you shall take and go to the place before the sanctuary which the Lord shall choose only your holy things let's let's read one more scripture 14 and to Deuteronomy same for you are a holy people set apart to the Lord your God and the Lord has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself above all the nations on the earth now I read it in the regular and verb King James verse 4 thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord have chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself of all the nations that upon the earth hallelujah father we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us and all that you are doing for us father I pray that you would bless the service in a special way forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord we'd be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated Larrin said it won't be long because of communion by God's grace but as we started this morning we were telling you or speaking to you about the message of freedom and really it is a message of freedom and our freedom was gained for us before the foundation of the world it's not something that it just happened but we have a choice in this freedom a choice to continue to go forward or a choice to - to remain under bondage I know I felt like I was leaving something but anyway we realized there was a law in the scripture and that law in the scripture tells us that we we have a choice and even though we are born in sin shaped and iniquities come out speak in lies we still have a choice to go free or to stay with the taskmaster according to Exodus 21 beginning at the first verse says now these are the judgments without shall set before them if thou by a Hebrew servant 6 years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself and if he were married and then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she had borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out himself and if the servants shall plainly say I love my master my wife my children I will no God not go out free then this master shall bring him forth unto the judges he should also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost understand this door is Christ Jesus Christ I am the way in his mastership bore his ear through within all and he shall serve Him whatever so it shows that even in the Jewish laws the laws were set there because there are times people God in difficult times and sometimes they were being who would sell their daughters to slavery a servant to be a servant but they had what they call in the law the year of Jubilee and of course we know that the year of Jubilee to the Jewish nation was every 400 said for sevens which would be four weeks or four and every every fiftieth year for let me put it this way - it took to simplify it but it always would be seven Sabbath's you know and what what we need to see by God's grace is that - to everybody sold into slavery every seventh year was a year of jubilee to them so they could get out because it may even though it may be a time when it may not have been for someone else but for those who have served their time when that jubilee trumpet was given or sounded they could go free now I said with every six years and on the seventh they could go free so you got to understand by God's grace amen God allowed that door to be open the only stipulation was that if the man came into this masters kingdom a house and he married a wife who was already a slave when that sound of that trumpet or when that year came that he could go free he could go free but the family the wife and the children belong to the master so it was almost an entrapment that's why you know even the prophet of God says you know under no circumstances do a believer marry an unbeliever there's always traps there's always snares and you know so that you understand he said then if the man chooses to stay with his wife and his family he can stay but when he stays amen it means that he has to be taken to the door right that that those words are not just a set therefore not the door is a way of entrance and the door is a way of exit and so we understand Amen that door represents Christ it this is a shadow this is a tight this has a spiritual meaning because everybody God gives a chance to experience the truth of Jesus Christ regardless to what denomination or organization they're in they will if they really thirst for Christ God will bring them to that place but you see that the truth of the matter is truth hurts truth is are hardly ever in the format in which you think it ought to be truth is wrong nothing about it is dressed up it's naked it is what it is and often time people say God I want more of you and when God comes on the scene they're not willing to make the sacrifice and and what do you mean brother books because God's way is straight and narrow remember the man who was born blind from birth thirty years he was blind but his parents was so knitted into that organization and the organization put out a decree if any man in this particular organization or this particular church is caught worshipping Jesus Christ or following him your name will be put off the book and you won't have nothing we won't have fellowship with you that was the threat so when they the Pharisees came to this man who was born blind and asked him who did give you sight they couldn't just say Jesus they say go ask my son he's of age he'll tell you you're in the story and the Pharisees came and they went to him the blind man and the blind man not even having a theological degree he said surely it must be in your writings that a man who doeth evil cannot heal yeah he said you can say whatever you want to say but let me say it like this I once was blind but now I see is it not true only that man or that person that come from God can do such a thing as this now he's preaching to the preacher and they got really angry at us ed him because here was this man trying to convert the Pharisees to believe on Jesus Christ guess what they did instead of embracing the truth from this man they kicked him out and in the message then came Jesus he said because every time you kicked out of a place for the name of Jesus Christ Jesus will always show up he'll take you in when nobody else will and surely this is a sign this is the thing that because their Jubilee came and Jesus even told them I am the door I am the way if you want to escape out of this slavery this bondage that you in I am the way and except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins he told them but they refused because of fear they refused because of the pressure that the Pharisee Pharisees and the Sadducees was placing on the people they didn't want to be persecuted they didn't want to be criticized and no doubt in that time the churches probably had some services that they were giving out so they didn't want to be cut off from those things either you know churches do that right oh yeah you don't believe no service and so yes so all of those things were if you could bring it to modern term was in play it was in the place and so therefore they they did what they chose to stay with the Pharisees and the Sadducees but the blind man not only did he receive light la Cite but he received life why because he heard a way of entrance and a way of escape right amen he didn't even know who healed him because he was blind but when Jesus began to talk to him he says show me this man so you see you see even in our day and time we must be careful that the system or assist we don't develop a system where that God would drop ruel relation or something new that was we'd be able to receive it because we understand the prophet of God said there is coming something and I know a lot of people think well it's already here he said known just prior to them after their coming a short quick message he said it whatever I said well that we already in that but what if we're not what if the system has interpreted that way because you got to understand that God's interpreters are one word what about it when brother man's ready it'll be so simple it'll pass right through you if you're not careful you'll miss it because everybody's looking here when we need to be looking here face down from the earth from which we come from humility humbleness amen coming to a place where we're looking at Christ as that little publicans said smiting his breakfast as the Lord I'm not worthy I'm not working I'm only worthy because you made me worthy that's it I have nothing to bring I have nothing to offer there's nothing that I can give it ain't about me is about you and you understand we are accepted in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus alone no church is accepted no organization accepted they missed them they missed the mark and ending everybody that trusted that we shall Methodist Beth I'm not just talking about them to our people who among this message that have formed a system thinking that the system is going to save them you are just as deceive as everybody else the truth about Jesus Christ is what saves you and that is Grace and it's something that God has to reveal to you Paul said I press toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ Jesus so we understand this calling is not not something that you can just walk into it is a press and it is a high calling we have all the church ages have the highest of all calling we have been called amen to a body change a translation hallelujah a people that will not have to see the grave hallelujah we bypassed there that's the coaly that's the calling what a freedom that we have to that to know that there's no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no condemnation when that sin is not imputed to us and the Bible said blessed is the man who look who God will not impute sin is that right and brother Branham said that man is the bride the bride has no sin imputed now I'm talking about a Holy Ghost filled bride now I'm not talking about potential I'm talking about somebody who has meant God's criteria woo how are we going to do it just like Samson said I love that oh Lord once more coz Samson realized one thing and he was a type of the bride that we are not thing without his anointing you can't add one cubit to your statue like I said this morning except the Lord build the house the laborer Labor's in vain we need God to build his house hallelujah when you know see we must understand that God is requiring us to be free from the world God has always separated darkness from light night from darkness you know and we are called to be free he said according to this message he says it's when you know that you have the earnest of your eternal Redemption right now in you by the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's already quickened you you are now risen with him and we're sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's what I'm talking about you know what heavenly places to us is it's the sixth dimension because we're born here in the third brother Branham said he saw our theophany in the sixth dimension yellow so we are quickened from here today in our spirit man y'all hear what I'm saying and that's why he said when you believe this message or receive this message you have heard from your theophany that means there's a part of you that's relaying messages to this part hallelujah and you must understand by God's grace that every time you go through something there's an angel ministering to you and he's the messenger he's the word and one-a-day dealt theophany and you were joined together and be one he's the strong man he's the perfect man hallelujah and he's the one that that by God's grace ministering and pulling us into the very statue of Christ whoo somebody help me here see quicken you you are now risen with him and we're setting together heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're no more of the world if you love the world and the affections are still on the things of the world then the love of God is not even in you see we are formed free from the world hmm we are from free from the world there is no more desire hallelujah now we're not working with the devil you know trying to put something in your mind or your spirit you can always fight this flesh forget it if you think you're gonna go scot free own it that's the only thing he can target he's our flesh because this that's the only thing that hasn't been converted yet right oh he knows what he's God he knows what he's working with hallelujah now listen what he says he says this in depth on adoption three if he's an archangel if he's a bishop if he's a general overseer if he's a doctor so-and-so whosoever he is if he doesn't preach the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't preach the restoration of the gifts the coming of Christ and all these things let him be accursed if he tries to take any of those things these words here and say it was for another day and place it over on some new fandangled idea that we learn off of sub seminary let him be accursed who that that's powerful absolutely as we say steps of holiness that's what people don't understand see people don't understand that that there is a true revelation of Jesus Christ and everything else is impersonations just like when Paul came he says I'm not going to preach another Jesus in other words there's another Jesus his name is Jesus but his character doesn't fit the word that's how we know that the Jesus that had been preached to us is the right one because the character of our Jesus is the same as the word see and we base that upon Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and whatever God Christ required yesterday he's requiring it today and forever is that all right so you must understand what our steps must be steps of holiness it must be steps of righteousness and there is not one of us who can project this or make manifest without Christ in us he's always been above us hallelujah but we need him in us too God has got a man stationed in the tabernacle did you know that every time you come to church there is a guest and we always welcome him huh yeah he said there's always a man stationed in this Tabernacle this morning he called he's called the Holy Spirit he knows the secrets of your heart he knows everything that you're doing or what you think he tells the father everything that you do he brings a message back and forth whew he says and he has told me that you waited and you worked and you've labored patiently waiting for me to come now you've been a slave for a long time but now your slave days are over I have brought along the minister talking with excuse me this is was a secret catching away to seek a sudden secret so you understand he taught my the young girl a man who the rancher son uh-huh yeah and she began to plan and she made herself ready right so you'll know where I'm coming from and now he says listen I have brought along the minister right under this rose a treeless you can become my wife he kissed her he put the wedding ring on her finger and picked her up and set her in the back board with his arms around her and drove off to find this new beautiful big place only out of drive of a Chicago now I just dropped that in but that's that's what he's saying so you could understand Amen he typed out the rapture in this and the choosing of a bride someone's simple but full of character right why she was ready she had lived and been the kind of a woman that he wanted it happened as despair at the moment and that sudden secret coming of the Lord the world don't know it is going to happen but we do it's at hand don't be like the young lady they stripped the clothes from in Pearl Harbor and go down and disgrace be like the one who made herself ready and kept her virtues and was waiting for the coming of the Lord cause it's be a secret and sudden so now you think God is going to I'm coming in about another two hours no it's not going to be anything like that it's going to be a sudden quick thing yeah that's the way it goes that's the way God has it coming and we must be ready that's why it's important to keep your virtues you know he's you always test it there every day you're tested you tried right in those areas and if you don't keep in prayer yield not to temptation or yuning if you're not careful you will yield to sin no cuz why this flesh is not perfected yet and he sent Jesus that his blood might be an atonement blood automa to make a perpetuation an exception or cleansing a cleansing process to constantly not just one time one revival but every living making intercessions that the Christian is kept clean day and night there is a blood of Jesus Christ that makes an exception on the cross there in the presence of God that cleanses us constantly day and night from all sin and we are safely tucked in what are you talking about that's why the Bible know you're going confess and as soon as you make a mistake you said Lord forgive me and the blood has cleansed you before you make your confession cleanses you day and night that's one proof you got something if a man can confess and ask for forgiveness that's proof he's got something and that's a witness he believed in the cleansing power of the blood Oh hallelujah he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into the judgment but has passed from death unto life that's you see that's why we preach do you know why we preach because the Bible said judgment begins at the house of God yo trial or your judgment is now that's that's the grace and mercy of God and as long as we can say yes Lord that's me forgive me cleanse me respond to the world in in a way of humility you your your right with God you'll never come to that judgment ever hallelujah is that Alright my attorney student might see what it is the Christian never goes to the judgment Christ went for him my attorney stood in my place he pleaded my case that's all word that I was ignorant he told me the father that I was wasn't worthy that I was ignorant oh thank God for my ignorance that's one time I'm glad I was ignorant but he loved me and he took my place and pleaded my case and took and today I'm free that's what I'm trying to tell you you're free if you can really see the power of the blood and what Jesus Christ has done for you you said what brother Brooks I'm not there yet you're like Abraham you call those things that be as though they were as long as you speak you're perfect you'll come to perfection it will manifest itself the life of God will manifest itself according to your confession is that right the project God said we have an angel that must bring those confessions to pass you confess it there's an angel says Lord he says he's this that angel will make it and help you bring that to pass it's a ministry that they have and has been ordained by God God is love I think God for the unseen huh you say what yeah yeah thank God is those unseen ministries that really helps us along is that right the boughs of the angel of the lord encamps about those circle you you closed and shut in camp about those that fear him right God is loving you just can't do nothing but love when God comes into you it's love brotherly love for one another not one-way love is not one way love goes two ways right hey now in the earth when Jesus was here God is almighty and he doesn't get smarter he's to save all the time do you believe that the human race gets smarter the Bible said they would they be weak and wiser but God is infinite we are finite we keep we keep each year well you know our science I'm moving on building better automobiles and our education is better than that God doesn't get in East but God doesn't get any smarter he's perfect to begin with so my question is why should we ever doubt someone not only smarter but perfect that means he can't make it as a bad decision every decision he has already made it's perfect you saw a lot why am I going through this because that is the perfect trial for you that's the perfect test I don't have to worry about you getting on my knees with your knees with discus soon as you get lifted up a little bit I know what the boom put turn it on right soon as you think you got it all together oh yeah there's no pride in me so every time you think you let your flesh get up in your face then I'm gonna hit the switch god knows what he's doing and I can't fight your battle and you can fight mine it's already cut its padding for every personality in here yours is different from mine and mine is because I tell you what some of y'all battles I wouldn't I'm going through some stuff now but I tell you what if I had a choice I'm gonna keep what I got hallelujah keep what you got and I'm gonna keep what I have cuz I couldn't do I couldn't do some of the things I know I just I know me yeah you know it would take a diner and riding for sho brothers yeah I wouldn't there would be no other way you know and it's the truth it's nothing but the truth hallelujah so don't they don't ever think I don't pray for some of the people God is so real to us and he knows what we can pair he knows what we can handle but let me say it like this the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord there's no way you can get out of it even the probably God wanted to leave he said honey I told my wife you know I really wouldn't mind leaving here now and and brother BAM said God said what are you doing trying to get out of it God knows we be trying to get out why don't you just shorten my days or something yeah you know make me perfect so I could get out of here he's gonna make you perfect and then you're gonna get in his time the Bible said he makes all things beautiful in his time hallelujah mmm a certain situation Rises and God calls on the scene to act the way the way God acts at that time he has to act every time and when the same circumstances arise again he has to act the same way he did this first time or he acted wrong the way he acted the first time in other words if there was a sinner calling for mercy and God saved that sinner the next Center calls God got to act the same way so were you talking about brother Brooks my point is this every man the Bible said if a man called on the name of Jesus for salvation he is then passed from death unto life and he can no longer he cannot come into the judgment y'all hear what I'm saying now you and I that that sound like it's just too simple it is but it's so powerful and it meant was this it means what it says and it said we're not talking about I have hearted confession I'm coming to sincere confession from the heart God has to accept it because those are the only kind that he can you know he'll somebody come to the altar popping gum and laughing and stuff like that and get down on their knees they're gonna go back the same way they came because they came in such an irreverent way God look for a broken and contrite spirit that's what pleases God right mmm see you gotta understand I'm almost done with this portion but I want you to understand that sincerity is one thing and got it God respect sincerity but in our sincerity we must understand that's why the message came the message came to put us in our proper place in while we are sincere because you can be sincere and sincerely wrong right and in my example was for this when david amen took the Ark of the Covenant and he was sincere he wanted to worship God but he built a cart and he put the Ark of the Covenant on wheels which was a shadow and a type of organization denomination it was not the Word of God because you got to realize that man that the Ark of the Covenant was to be carried above the Levi's heart on their shoulder on that side but so it was out of the word was out of all it was misplaced and so therefore when you misplace the word God can't bless it you sure what do you mean they shouted they danced the music play they were happy it looked like a real revival that David was carrying on but one of David's sincere men when he saw the ark tilt he went to stay it in his sincerity he was killed right so understand you can't help the ministry whenever you put your hand to the ministry to help it in that way you die spiritually in other words if you're not called to preach you don't go preach you out order you've misplaced the word so I so all I'm a woman and I know I can preach God didn't say you couldn't he said you should because Amen is not in the woman's position to be a preacher oh they got it so bad now they got an assistant pastors some pastors are they anointed yes so was David how they look like they're getting results yes so did David but because they are because they can't put the word in the wrong place it was never supposed to be on the organization of the denomination it was supposed to be carried upon the heart and God did what semi sincere man in a ministry that he was not called to be in hello and I say this to say I said put it together the way brother Bailey did he said by doing this he caused the death of a sincere man putting his hand on the ark when he shouldn't have done it a great sincere man think the anointing and everything was just right but the ark was moving in its wrong way I've got friends you know even women friends who are preachers pastors whatever they are they can't believe this message because they are anointed when they preach but let me ask you a question how can a woman even in her preaching bring forth genuine life naturally it can't be done because the woman carries the egg it is a man who carries the seed you see and in that scenario that's why I woman can't preach or shouldn't because because of of the anointing doesn't even mean that it is the truth 19 and listen a false revelation of the word will bring a false experience Satan will make sure it happens he's going to make sure by that's why I try to tell people I said oh we are nothing that's good but what are you preaching see you know look at all the calls they all have a 19th of some kind if it ain't Jesus is something else now I would tell you like the prophet of God said he said they're going to be surprised when they realize they were not worshipping Jesus Christ oh but the anointing Satan has disguised himself as the angel of light and we know that demons travel by Trinity yes that's how they travel not all God's gonna there's got to be you know I just go by the church ages the Bible tells us that in the 3rd 3rd chapter of Revelation Jesus was outside the door now if he's outside who's inside there's an ax posture somewhere there's something that's pretending to be the holy ghost because the holy ghost will change your nature and when you can see people Amen that's in I'm talking about even around here when when that Holy Ghost is in you and it's not changing your nature something wrong with the experience it has to change your nature it must change your nature if it ain't changing your nature there's an imposter somewhere that's why we can't say oh I spoke in tongues or I shouted or I danced all those those things are good and in the devil can do them all but if this message that's been preached and been you heard is not changing you from glory to glory to glory little by little something wrong somewhere something's wrong there's no way you can listen to this that was behind the curtain this message came from the Shekinah it didn't come from a Theological Seminary it didn't come from no organization this message came from behind the veil and that word that was behind the veil transformed a rod it made it bud and bloom ah bloom and bring forth almonds yeah this message all you have to do is stand still and see the salvation of the Lord you keep reading you keep eating you keep feeding and it would transform you you won't have to work it does all the work that's the way it is that's what grace is all about that's our Liberty you love the Lord oh I just get stirred she the oxen the Bible said stumbled not the Levi the oxen stumbled and the cart was being pitched over and a sincere man with his heart full of love put his hand upon the ark to hold it back and was stricken and dead because no man could touch the ark but a Levite see how God keeps his word keeps his candle keep his order as I had was smitten with leprosy here is David and altogether caused the death of man and a great disaster being anointed with the spirit both of them but out of God's channel that is the worst thing that could possibly happen to a brother or sister that when they come to their time to cross over they realized that they have been deceived and the Bible says there'll be many many in that day that will be deceived he said only a few be that find it he talked about the world the whirling trying to find Jesus you talk about Christians or those who call themselves Christians and think about the many that are receiving the mark of the beast because the truth comes to them and they reject it you better bet you would have been better to remain you know being an organization never heard this you understand me yeah but called God I have mercy on a man or woman who's never heard because they didn't have an opportunity to reject but you said with this message now let's go to the just a simplicity a man or woman who comes through the knowledge that baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is correct and because their system believes in the Father Son and Holy Ghost they are afraid that be persecuted so they stay with the system other than moving with the word and at that time they received the mark of the beast don't even know it you know what happens angel of deception comes and mark them and they'll never see it ever again so you got to see it and understand that you know me you come to the knowledge that means an understanding it's right and you refuse it because of your system so it is in this message so is it with this it don't stop it constantly cuz God constantly progress it all right and if God began to reveal and show us like right now trying to play me come tell us amen it is the Lord Jesus Christ it can only be the Lord Jesus Christ there's only one to be glorified he larger than a lie didn't grow if I himself is that right Moses didn't glorify himself if you understand me only one can be glorified and that is the Lord Jesus Christ you love the Lord we appreciate it we're just gonna stop their message of freedom a message of freedom that's where we are a message of freedom you love the
