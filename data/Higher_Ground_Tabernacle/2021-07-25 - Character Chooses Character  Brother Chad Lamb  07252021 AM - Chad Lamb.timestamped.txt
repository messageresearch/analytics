[52:27] it's nice when you know it's nice when
[52:30] you feel the pool
[52:35] [Music]
[52:41] [Music]
[52:42] the disciples were sad they disciplined
[52:46] they had lost their master
[52:49] but he began to walk with them and he
[52:52] began to reveal the word to them
[52:56] and later they confessed that their
[52:57] hearts burned within them
[53:10] because you have to invite the one in
[53:12] who's
[53:26] and when he was behind closed doors
[53:30] privately he took the bread and broke
[53:34] the bread
[53:36] and when he broke the bread it
[53:39] symbolized the breaking of the words
[53:44] not a public revelation but a private
[53:47] revelation
[53:50] and when he broke the word to them
[53:53] their eyes were opened and they knew who
[53:56] this was
[53:58] and i pray that god will break the bread
[54:00] this morning
[54:02] that'll break the bread to you and
[54:05] you'll recognize that that's him
[54:47] if we could all turn while we're
[54:48] standing to the book of genesis
[55:00] genesis 24 and we'll begin reading at
[55:04] 12.
[55:08] we know in genesis 24 that abraham is
[55:11] sending eliezers
[55:16] and he's commanding him to bring us a
[55:18] wife for my son isaac
[55:23] and so that's what's going on in 24.
[55:27] and he says take not a wife from the
[55:29] canaanites
[55:30] take not a wife from the canaan
[55:47] the bride must come from the same family
[55:49] as the group
[55:52] because in this hour the groom come from
[55:54] god
[55:58] and god is the groom's father
[56:01] and so now the bride must be of the same
[56:03] family
[56:06] the same bloodline because there's gonna
[56:09] be no mixing of the bloodlines
[56:12] so the bride must come from the father
[56:14] as well
[56:17] that's why abraham and sarah had the
[56:19] same father
[56:22] amen they were of the same bloodline
[56:26] and the bride of christ and jesus
[56:42] and he kneels down he comes to the well
[56:44] outside of the city
[56:48] and this is what he says
[56:52] and he said oh lord god of my master
[56:54] abraham i pray thee send me good speed
[56:56] this day and show kindness unto my
[56:58] master abraham.
[57:06] behold i stand here by the well of water
[57:08] and the daughters of the men of the city
[57:10] come out to draw water
[57:17] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[57:19] to whom i shall say let down thy picture
[57:21] i pray thee
[57:22] that i may drink and she shall say drink
[57:24] and i will give thy camel's drink also
[57:27] let the same be she that thou hast
[57:29] appointed for thy servant isaac
[57:31] and thereby shall i know that thou has
[57:33] showed kindness into my mastery
[57:38] of
[57:48] and it came to pass before he had done
[57:50] speaking that behold
[57:51] rebecca came out who was born of bethuel
[57:53] son of milka the wife of nahor
[57:55] abraham's brother with her picture upon
[57:58] her shoulder
[58:00] palm coffin
[58:06] from and the damsel was very fair to
[58:10] look upon a virgin
[58:11] neither had any man known her and she
[58:13] went down to the well and filled her
[58:15] picture and came up
[58:20] with
[58:25] and the servant ran to meet her and said
[58:27] let me i pray thee drink a little water
[58:29] of thy pictures
[58:36] and she said drink my lord and she
[58:37] hasted and let down her picture upon her
[58:39] hand
[58:40] and gave him drink.
[58:46] and when she had done giving him drink
[58:48] she said i will draw water for that
[58:49] camels also
[58:50] until they have done drinking
[58:58] and she hasted and emptied her picture
[58:59] into the trough and ran again into the
[59:01] well to draw water
[59:02] and
[59:29] this morning
[59:44] that we might know you better and that
[59:47] we might
[59:47] understand how you want us to live in
[59:50] this hour
[59:53] we give you preeminence this morning
[59:56] and we yield ourselves into you in jesus
[1:00:13] it's important the kind of bride that he
[1:00:15] would be back it is
[1:00:17] important because this was going to be
[1:00:20] the bride for his master son
[1:00:26] we know brother branham was eliezer in
[1:00:28] time
[1:00:31] he was sent into the world to fetch a
[1:00:34] bride for christ
[1:00:37] and it was a difficult job but eliezer
[1:00:41] was not going to use his own mind
[1:00:46] he wasn't going to choose of his own
[1:00:47] choosing
[1:00:51] but he prayed god i don't know how to
[1:00:54] make this choice
[1:00:56] i need you to choose he said
[1:00:59] let the one that he left when i asked
[1:01:03] for her to give me a drink
[1:01:06] if she says she'll give me a drink
[1:01:09] but also give water to my camels
[1:01:12] that'll be the one
[1:01:17] was looking for somebody that could
[1:01:21] catch inspiration from god
[1:01:22] this
[1:01:50] that was god's choice the one that could
[1:01:53] read between the lines
[1:01:56] the one that could catch what the
[1:01:57] prophet was saying
[1:02:00] when he wouldn't come right out and say
[1:02:02] it
[1:02:04] when he would say i hope you're catching
[1:02:05] what i'm saying
[1:02:09] he said one place he said i've said
[1:02:12] enough
[1:02:14] that the predestinator will catch it
[1:02:17] and eliezer said enough so the
[1:02:21] predestinated brad would catch it
[1:02:25] and she caught the unspoken part
[1:02:29] she caught the mystery ela
[1:02:32] and he knew she was the one
[1:02:35] so it wasn't eliezer's choosing
[1:02:38] it was god's jews and how did god reveal
[1:02:42] his choosing
[1:02:44] by revelation
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:00] but he was looking for the bride that
[1:03:01] could catch revelation
[1:03:04] the one that could catch revelation she
[1:03:07] was the predestination
[1:03:10] she was god's choice but let's go over
[1:03:13] to verse 55.
[1:03:15] university they go back to the family of
[1:03:19] rebecca
[1:03:22] explains his mission
[1:03:26] and they agree
[1:03:34] said and her brother and her mother said
[1:03:36] let the damsel abide with us a few days
[1:03:38] at the least ten after that she shall go
[1:03:42] love
[1:03:47] and he said unto them hinder me not
[1:03:49] seeing the lord hath prospered my way
[1:03:51] send me away that i may go to my master
[1:03:56] number
[1:03:59] and they said we will call the damsel in
[1:04:01] inquiry at her mouth
[1:04:06] and they called rebecca and said unto
[1:04:08] her will thou go with this man
[1:04:09] and she said i will go man
[1:04:17] amen see brother branham opens with this
[1:04:19] scripture
[1:04:22] when he's preaching choosing of a bride
[1:04:38] and the one who could catch the mystery
[1:04:42] she would be the bride but she also had
[1:04:45] to make a choice
[1:04:48] so there's two sides the choosing of a
[1:04:50] bride
[1:05:03] what choice the bride will make the
[1:05:05] schwa
[1:05:18] but he said the woman also must choose
[1:05:34] god
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:48] reflects what's in her reflex
[1:05:51] and god's choice of rebecca illustrated
[1:05:54] reflects what's in god reflects because
[1:05:57] your choice
[1:05:59] reflects what's inside you reflect
[1:06:02] amen so this morning also i'd like to
[1:06:05] take for a subject
[1:06:08] character chooses character
[1:06:11] the character character chooses
[1:06:14] characters
[1:06:16] the choice you make the schwa reveals
[1:06:19] your character
[1:06:22] in the smyrnan church
[1:06:26] out of the church age book don't believe
[1:06:28] the disaster
[1:06:30] disagrees
[1:06:37] that the purpose of god according to
[1:06:38] election might stand
[1:06:48] he says that the purpose of god
[1:06:50] according to election might stand
[1:06:55] he goes on to say you can't read it any
[1:06:57] other way
[1:07:08] is there any greater purpose
[1:07:11] than the heart purpose when you get to
[1:07:15] the heart purpose
[1:07:18] you've gotten to the core
[1:07:21] you've got to the main point
[1:07:25] so the heart purpose hello
[1:08:16] he said the kind of woman that a man
[1:08:18] would choose will reflect his ambition
[1:08:19] and his character
[1:08:34] and what he ties himself to shows truly
[1:08:36] what's in him
[1:08:42] a woman reflects what's in the man when
[1:08:44] he chooses her for wife
[1:08:49] it shows what's down
[1:09:02] is now talking about natural marriage
[1:09:32] what christ will join himself too
[1:09:36] will reflect what's in him
[1:09:40] so if you want to see christ's character
[1:09:44] look at the bride of his jews
[1:10:02] because the bride of christ has to
[1:10:03] reflect his character
[1:10:08] he says now it is becoming if a
[1:10:12] christian would choose a wife
[1:10:13] element don't show
[1:10:26] it's what she is what makes her sick
[1:10:41] and what's going to be in the future
[1:10:44] for his family will be raised by such a
[1:10:46] woman
[1:10:50] for the future plans for his home
[1:10:54] so brother branham is preaching that
[1:10:58] god's choice for a bride
[1:10:59] to destroy the jupiter reflects his
[1:11:02] character
[1:11:04] and his idea
[1:11:08] of the future amen
[1:11:13] he goes on to say he continues now we
[1:11:16] see plainly the spiritual plan
[1:11:21] of god's planning for his future home
[1:11:23] diploma
[1:11:37] it's showing god's plan for his future
[1:11:42] with his future bride it's now coming
[1:11:45] into view
[1:11:47] on reality
[1:11:52] you you have to plan if you
[1:11:55] look and pray
[1:11:59] when you're choosing for we
[1:12:02] see by this the word of promise
[1:12:10] the bride that a man would choose is
[1:12:12] going to reflect his character
[1:12:17] it reflects what's in him
[1:12:20] amen now could you imagine a man filled
[1:12:23] with the holy ghost taking something
[1:12:25] like that to be a wife
[1:12:31] i just don't see it brother now maybe
[1:12:34] i'm just an old crank a protector
[1:12:37] but you know i just can't understand
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:41] it's going to reflect what's in him
[1:12:44] she is going to make him she's going to
[1:12:47] help him make his future home
[1:13:14] you'll never be happy in the future
[1:13:18] and heaven is not for you the realm
[1:13:21] beyond time is not for you
[1:13:25] because if you cannot fellowship with
[1:13:26] your brothers here
[1:13:29] they are the reflection of the future
[1:13:31] home reflection
[1:13:34] you can say i want to go to that time
[1:13:38] that place be on time
[1:13:42] to the new heavens and do earth
[1:14:06] [Applause]
[1:14:11] you'll never be there
[1:14:53] because your brother is a reflection of
[1:14:55] god
[1:14:58] amen amen that's why we believe in
[1:15:00] fellowship
[1:15:02] that's why we believe in coming together
[1:15:03] and having a church
[1:15:07] it's a reflection of the future homes
[1:15:13] now we change back now for a moment to
[1:15:15] the spiritual side
[1:15:19] and when you see a church that's in the
[1:15:20] world
[1:15:36] god's commandments as if he had never
[1:15:38] wrote them
[1:15:40] commandments
[1:15:44] you can just imagine christ is not going
[1:15:46] to take a bribe like that
[1:15:51] could you imagine taking the modern
[1:15:53] church today for a bride
[1:15:55] if we imagine
[1:15:58] not my lord i could hardly see that
[1:16:04] remember now a man and his wife are one.
[1:16:09] would you join yourself to a person like
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:13] if you would it would kind of disappoint
[1:16:17] my faith in you
[1:16:22] and then how about god joining himself
[1:16:24] to something like that
[1:16:27] a regular denominational prostitute
[1:16:32] you think he would do it having a form
[1:16:35] of godliness but denying the power
[1:16:36] thereof
[1:16:40] he would never do it she must have his
[1:16:43] character in her
[1:16:45] el dorado the real true born-again
[1:16:48] church must have the character that was
[1:16:50] in christ
[1:16:55] because the husband and wife are one
[1:16:57] basket
[1:16:59] and if jesus did only that which please
[1:17:01] god
[1:17:04] kept his word and manifest his word
[1:17:08] his bride will have to be of the same
[1:17:10] character
[1:17:13] let's turn to john chapter 8.
[1:17:30] in verse 28
[1:17:34] then jesus said unto them when you have
[1:17:36] lifted up the son of man then shall you
[1:17:38] know that i am he
[1:17:39] and that i do nothing of myself but as
[1:17:41] the father taught me
[1:17:53] and he that sent me is with me the
[1:17:55] father hath not left me alone for i do
[1:17:58] always those things that please him.
[1:18:07] this was the character of the bridegroom
[1:18:10] this
[1:18:24] but the father's idea not his own word
[1:18:28] but the father's word and he only did
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:34] that please the father
[1:18:37] now that was the character of christ
[1:18:52] that
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:06] not
[1:19:19] and she will only do that which pleases
[1:19:20] the father
[1:19:23] that's the only kind of bride that
[1:19:25] christ can have
[1:19:29] every other church was put away
[1:19:34] she was engaged to be married to christ
[1:19:41] but she began to take man's ideas
[1:19:45] and she began to move from the word of
[1:19:48] god
[1:20:01] because she couldn't be the right kind
[1:20:02] of bride
[1:20:16] predestinated
[1:20:22] that he will have a bride of his own
[1:20:23] choosing
[1:20:26] and she will have the same character
[1:20:27] that christ
[1:20:30] she will have the word and the word only
[1:20:35] no denominational ideas no personal
[1:20:39] ideas
[1:20:43] amen let's turn to the book of esther
[1:20:47] chapter one
[1:20:58] we know the story of esther
[1:21:01] it's a type of the bride
[1:21:05] in chapter one verse five
[1:21:08] university and when those days are
[1:21:11] expired the king had made a feast unto
[1:21:13] all the people that were present in
[1:21:14] shush and the palace
[1:21:16] both under great and small seven days in
[1:21:18] the court of the garden
[1:21:19] of the king's palace
[1:21:26] capital
[1:21:55] in verse 9. also vastly the queen made a
[1:21:59] feast for the women
[1:22:00] in the royal house which belonged to the
[1:22:02] king alzares
[1:22:05] you see um
[1:22:10] well the king was having a feast
[1:22:13] of time the queen had her own feast
[1:22:18] and she had a feast for the women
[1:22:21] and the women in the bible's the type of
[1:22:23] the churches
[1:22:27] so this queen represents the catholic
[1:22:30] church
[1:22:32] and and the seven church ages
[1:22:35] starts to have her own feasts
[1:22:50] on the seventh day
[1:22:53] the seventh age
[1:22:56] on the seventh day when the heart of the
[1:22:58] king was merry with wine he commanded
[1:23:00] me big that
[1:23:08] and carcass the seven chamberlain's that
[1:23:10] served in the presence of azares the
[1:23:11] king
[1:23:13] shocked
[1:23:18] victor
[1:23:25] to bring vasti the queen before the king
[1:23:27] with the crown royal
[1:23:28] to show the people and the princes her
[1:23:30] beauty for she was fair to look on
[1:23:47] typing the seven angels
[1:23:50] of the seven church age messenger
[1:23:55] all seven in one day
[1:23:58] to bring the queen
[1:24:14] but the queen vashti refused to come at
[1:24:17] the king's commandment
[1:24:18] by his chamberlain's therefore was the
[1:24:20] king very roth
[1:24:21] and his anger burned in him refused
[1:24:41] of all the seven church ages
[1:24:45] the mystery of the seven seals
[1:24:49] all all seven revealed in this day
[1:24:54] calling for his queen to come
[1:25:11] yourself to the commandment of the king
[1:25:14] so she refused to come at the king's
[1:25:18] calling
[1:25:20] and this message is the king's calling
[1:25:24] through the seven chamberlains unique
[1:25:27] all calling the bride to come
[1:25:30] here and she re that she refused to come
[1:25:34] verse 19 says if it please the king let
[1:25:38] there be a royal commandment from him
[1:25:39] and
[1:25:40] let it be written among the laws of the
[1:25:41] persians and the medes
[1:25:43] that it be not altered that vashti come
[1:25:45] no more before the king azaris
[1:25:47] and let the king give her royal estate
[1:25:49] into another
[1:25:50] that is better than she
[1:26:19] will be given to another one
[1:26:30] amen chapter two
[1:26:38] after these things when the wrath of
[1:26:39] king azaris was appeased he remembered
[1:26:42] vashti
[1:26:42] and what she had done and what was
[1:26:44] decreed against her
[1:26:48] appreciations
[1:26:53] then said the king's servants that
[1:26:55] ministered unto him let there be fair
[1:26:57] young virgins sought
[1:26:58] for the king concerned
[1:27:05] and let the king appoint officers in all
[1:27:07] the provinces of his kingdom
[1:27:08] that they may gather together all the
[1:27:10] fair young virgins in shusha and the
[1:27:12] palace
[1:27:12] to the house of the women and to the
[1:27:14] custody of haggy the king's chamberlain
[1:27:16] keeper of the women and let their things
[1:27:18] for purification
[1:27:19] be given
[1:27:36] and let the maiden which pleases the
[1:27:38] king be queen instead of vashti
[1:27:40] and the thing pleased the king and he
[1:27:42] did so it could have
[1:27:44] been
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:59] and they're gonna and the king's going
[1:28:00] to choose
[1:28:02] the one that pleases him
[1:28:06] he's looking for one that's better than
[1:28:08] vashti
[1:28:11] because vashti pleased herself
[1:28:26] but she's looking
[1:28:42] this is going to be another type of
[1:28:44] brother branham
[1:28:46] because he's going to watch over those
[1:28:48] virgins
[1:28:50] and give them what they need for
[1:28:51] purification
[1:28:54] they're going
[1:29:07] are washed by the water of the words
[1:29:11] washing away all the filth that they
[1:29:13] brought to the message
[1:29:16] and they're being anointed with the holy
[1:29:18] ghost it's their own want to do
[1:29:19] something
[1:29:20] so they can bring forth a fragrance up
[1:29:22] it's
[1:29:37] now when every maid's turn was to come
[1:29:39] to go into the king azaris
[1:29:41] after that she had been 12 months
[1:29:43] according to the man or the women
[1:29:45] for so were the days of their
[1:29:46] purification accomplished to wit
[1:29:48] six months with oil of myrrh and six
[1:29:51] months with sweet odors
[1:29:52] and with other things for the purifying
[1:29:54] of the women
[1:30:12] then thus came every maintenance to the
[1:30:14] king whatsoever she desired was given
[1:30:16] her to go with her out of the house of
[1:30:18] the women
[1:30:19] into the king's house
[1:30:29] so after the time of purification
[1:30:32] when it was her time to go before the
[1:30:33] king
[1:30:36] she was allowed to take anything she
[1:30:38] required
[1:30:41] anything she desired she had already
[1:30:44] been
[1:30:44] brought through purification
[1:30:55] because everybody has to present
[1:30:57] themselves to the king
[1:32:10] the way she thought would be pleasing to
[1:32:13] the king
[1:32:16] oh friends we get upset
[1:32:20] because there's so many differences in
[1:32:22] the message
[1:32:24] so many
[1:32:38] ideas and perverted the pure word that
[1:32:42] we've got
[1:32:45] but i tell you it's ordained of god
[1:32:49] because you can come to the message and
[1:32:52] you can get
[1:32:52] any flavor you desire
[1:32:56] you can choose any idea you can want
[1:33:00] vicious and you can adorn yourself with
[1:33:04] that kind of word
[1:33:05] it proves
[1:33:27] [Applause]
[1:34:01] i say it's all of god
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:14] let's go over to verse 15. the very
[1:34:22] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[1:34:24] of abigail the uncle of mordecai
[1:34:26] who had taken her first daughter was
[1:34:28] come to go into the king
[1:34:30] she required nothing but what haggai the
[1:34:32] king's chamberlain
[1:34:33] the keeper of the women appointed and
[1:34:35] esther obtained favor in the sight of
[1:34:37] all them that looked upon her
[1:34:40] lost
[1:34:59] king is then they would move to the
[1:35:01] other house of the concubine
[1:35:05] and then there was many that were going
[1:35:06] to be concubine
[1:35:09] but there was one that was going to be a
[1:35:12] wife
[1:35:14] and so when they would come along they
[1:35:16] would choose whatever they wanted
[1:35:20] if they wanted a big hair bow
[1:35:23] a nice necklace a sweet perfume
[1:35:27] they wanted to wear purple or they
[1:35:30] wanted to wear red
[1:35:32] whatever they desired it was given to
[1:35:35] them
[1:35:36] and they would go to the kings but when
[1:35:39] esther came velocity
[1:35:52] and this bride doesn't want anything
[1:36:22] but
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:50] he
[1:37:04] this is how he likes for you to dress
[1:37:07] this is how he likes for you to behave
[1:37:11] amen amen and esther caught a revelation
[1:37:16] all the other women missed it
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:40] but i'm going to take from somebody who
[1:37:42] knows what they're talking about
[1:37:45] and she required nothing but what heggy
[1:37:48] i had a point
[1:37:52] and everybody who saw her
[1:37:56] she had favor with them
[1:37:59] there was something different about
[1:38:01] esther
[1:38:03] than the rest of the women
[1:38:07] there was something that made her stand
[1:38:09] out
[1:38:11] different and it wasn't her superior
[1:38:14] beauty
[1:38:27] they went out to 127 provinces
[1:38:32] province and they gathered in the most
[1:38:34] beautiful women
[1:38:38] from india to ethiopia
[1:38:42] the most of the world at that time
[1:38:46] they gathered the most beautiful women
[1:38:51] from every nation
[1:38:56] amen and they were going to choose one
[1:38:59] so it wasn't that esther was beautiful
[1:39:01] and the rest were not
[1:39:04] they were all beautiful but there was
[1:39:07] something different about this one
[1:39:14] so esther was taken into the king as
[1:39:16] heiress into his house royal in the
[1:39:17] tenth month
[1:39:18] which is the month tibet in the seventh
[1:39:20] year of his reign
[1:39:24] is
[1:39:38] in the seventh year dude so esther is
[1:39:41] going to meet the king
[1:39:44] at 10 7 uh at 10
[1:39:47] 7. revelation 10 7.
[1:39:59] and the king loved esther above all the
[1:40:02] women
[1:40:02] and she obtained grace and favor in his
[1:40:04] sight more than all the virgins
[1:40:06] so that he set the royal crown upon her
[1:40:08] head and made her queen
[1:40:10] instead of vashti
[1:40:20] is
[1:40:33] she didn't have her own conception she
[1:40:36] didn't adorn herself according to her
[1:40:38] own likes
[1:40:40] but she was reflecting the king's
[1:40:42] character
[1:40:44] because i was teaching the king's
[1:40:46] character
[1:40:48] and she
[1:41:16] that didn't want to please herself
[1:41:19] she wanted to please the king
[1:41:22] because when the decree went out he was
[1:41:26] looking for one of the virgins
[1:41:29] that would please the king not that
[1:41:32] would please yourself
[1:41:34] that's why the denominations have been
[1:41:36] rejected in this day
[1:41:40] pleasing themselves
[1:41:43] but god is looking for one
[1:42:10] that's why he couldn't choose through
[1:42:11] the church ages
[1:42:40] you
[1:42:52] the prophet of god says prophet to judy
[1:42:56] now we were made for christ
[1:43:00] christ wasn't made for us
[1:43:03] that's what we try to do today in our
[1:43:05] textbooks
[1:43:07] let's try to make the word which is
[1:43:09] christ
[1:43:15] instead of us trying to make ourselves
[1:43:16] to suit the words
[1:43:20] that's the difference the bible says
[1:43:24] that one man was not made for woman
[1:43:28] but the woman was made for the man
[1:43:31] and now christ wasn't made for us
[1:43:34] but the bride was made for christopher
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:44:18] and follow
[1:44:31] i said this is what god is looking for
[1:44:35] this is what the interpretation of this
[1:44:37] word
[1:44:40] stick with the word and the true bride
[1:44:44] take the word and the word
[1:44:59] [Applause]
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:28] and they would mix
[1:46:47] [Applause]
[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:58] you better believe that's the color i'm
[1:48:00] going to wear
[1:48:02] when
[1:48:30] how
[1:48:44] and all the
[1:48:58] to haggai because he had been there
[1:49:04] but some were adding their own
[1:49:06] interpretations
[1:49:10] but esther was catching it all
[1:49:25] the other impregnated by the word of god
[1:49:28] and will bring forth the body
[1:49:40] the finished body of jesus christ
[1:49:44] which is the bride what is the finished
[1:49:48] body of jesus christ
[1:49:51] it's the bride what's the bride
[1:49:53] impregnated with
[1:50:13] amen amen the body of christ isn't
[1:50:17] finished yet
[1:50:20] how many knows that a man and his woman
[1:50:23] is one
[1:50:24] from infamous and christ is one body the
[1:50:27] word
[1:50:30] the bride will have to be the rest of
[1:50:31] that body
[1:50:34] and the two together makes one body
[1:50:55] his mind of course is his will
[1:51:00] and as well as the word now the word has
[1:51:03] been restored
[1:51:33] he don't attract the people at churches
[1:51:35] that are attracted by big denominations
[1:51:37] and big doings and being carrying ons
[1:51:39] and fancy things
[1:51:46] the shoes but the word of god attracts
[1:51:50] the bride of christ
[1:51:54] what do you have to do to find the bride
[1:51:57] preach the word and live the word
[1:52:02] it must be preached but it must be
[1:52:05] preached in the power of the
[1:52:06] manifestation
[1:52:07] of the life
[1:52:11] you can't just speak but you have to
[1:52:25] because he's looking for his character
[1:52:28] in and she has to be attracted
[1:52:32] to his character
[1:52:35] she has to be of the same character
[1:52:39] and if she's of the same character
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:11] because of his character
[1:53:14] character chooses character why were you
[1:53:17] attracted to this word
[1:53:20] because the prophet of god showed the
[1:53:22] character of christ
[1:53:24] you
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:51] and there's always a conflict inside is
[1:53:54] it yet
[1:53:55] but when you saw the character of christ
[1:53:59] when it was on display and the life of
[1:54:02] the prophet
[1:54:04] you say that's the character i'm
[1:54:06] attracted to
[1:54:32] [Applause]
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:55:01] that's what i am
[1:55:15] to meet him in the air
[1:55:19] amen amen so christ is not complete
[1:55:23] or christmas in male form only
[1:55:29] but he must be male and female
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:42] when god would make a man after his own
[1:55:56] and he was given dominion over all the
[1:55:58] earth
[1:56:12] this is the first time in all of god's
[1:56:14] creations
[1:56:17] he looks at what he made and he says
[1:56:20] it's not good
[1:56:22] how could make any how could god make
[1:56:24] anything that's not good come on
[1:56:28] see god said that do at this point so
[1:56:30] the bride would catch something
[1:56:34] it's not good that man should dwell
[1:56:37] alone
[1:56:39] i will make him a health meet
[1:56:51] because god wanted beings he could
[1:56:52] fellowship with you
[1:57:07] and what his whole plan was going to be
[1:57:11] so he said i will make a help meet for
[1:57:12] him
[1:57:15] so he brought out of the dust to the
[1:57:16] ground
[1:57:18] all the animals through these animals
[1:57:20] and he brought them under adam
[1:57:35] there was nothing adam could fellowship
[1:57:37] with
[1:57:38] person
[1:57:43] put adam to sleep
[1:57:46] and he took part of adam and he made the
[1:57:50] woman and he split his spirit
[1:57:54] and pulled the feminists over
[1:57:58] and created the woman out of the man
[1:58:02] and then he woke at him up hello
[1:58:18] god
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:32] he wanted a family he wanted
[1:58:35] something that would come out of him
[1:58:39] you could unite back with him that he
[1:58:42] could have fellowship with
[1:58:43] avec so now he's showing he was
[1:58:47] foreshadowing i mean
[1:58:49] what he was going to do in christ when
[1:58:52] christ was here he was male and female
[1:58:56] when christ was here i was with him
[1:59:31] [Applause]
[1:59:55] and bring the two together so that he
[1:59:58] could say it's very good
[2:00:02] so the the body of christ is not
[2:00:04] finished
[2:00:07] until the female is finished
[2:00:10] just like adam wasn't complete just come
[2:00:12] i don't even complain until eve came on
[2:00:14] the scene
[2:00:16] everything they were united together
[2:00:19] and so now the bride is bringing forth
[2:00:21] the finished body of christos
[2:00:53] form of the puzzle and this message has
[2:00:56] united her back to her head
[2:01:00] united her back to her mate
[2:01:04] it was a deep calling to the deep amen
[2:01:21] so the word of god attracts the bride of
[2:01:24] christ
[2:01:27] remember when jesus christ was here
[2:01:30] he was the manifested word for his day
[2:01:34] and he chose disciples and those
[2:01:37] disciples left everything to follow him
[2:01:41] they saw something in christ that they
[2:01:45] were willing to leave their businesses
[2:01:48] their occupations
[2:02:01] towards the end of the ministry it got
[2:02:02] difficult
[2:02:06] and he began to say some things
[2:02:09] that drive the crowds away
[2:02:13] and then it wasn't exciting anymore
[2:02:27] and then jesus said something more
[2:02:29] difficult
[2:02:31] and he wasn't explaining he nick speaker
[2:02:34] he was just speaking and it was driving
[2:02:37] them away in confusion
[2:02:41] but then he turned to his disciples
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:03:06] [Applause]
[2:03:10] what was peter attracted to the
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:19] [Applause]
[2:03:24] when jesus was no longer working
[2:03:26] miracles
[2:03:30] but there was something deeper that was
[2:03:31] attracting peter yeah
[2:03:35] anyone come to the testing time
[2:03:38] when it comes to the hour of
[2:03:39] disappointment
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:06] this alone is the words of eternal life
[2:04:21] so the bride is attracted to the word
[2:04:27] and brotherhood says the true bride
[2:04:33] attracts the attention of god
[2:04:51] the attention of the true bride
[2:04:54] but how does the bride attract the
[2:04:56] attention of god
[2:05:00] by keeping his words
[2:05:03] oh it's that simple by surrendering to
[2:05:06] the words
[2:05:07] by submitting to the word how did esther
[2:05:10] attract the attention of the king
[2:05:14] by only doing what haggai had appointed
[2:05:33] what was gleaning in the fields
[2:05:39] in the fields of boaz
[2:05:43] her husband was dead she was in poverty
[2:05:48] she was a single woman and she was young
[2:05:53] she had nothing but in chapter three
[2:05:59] verse seven
[2:06:02] in chapter three naomi gives her
[2:06:04] instructions
[2:06:07] this is how i want you to present
[2:06:09] yourself to boa
[2:06:12] and ruth has the kind of character
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:40] and naomi gives instruction to ruth
[2:06:50] and when boaz had eaten and drunk and
[2:06:52] his heart was merry
[2:06:53] he went to lie down at the end of the
[2:06:55] heap of corn and she came softly and
[2:06:57] uncovered his feet
[2:06:59] and laid her down
[2:07:11] and it came to pass at midnight that the
[2:07:13] man was afraid and turned himself and
[2:07:14] behold
[2:07:15] a woman lay at his feet
[2:07:23] and he said who art thou and she
[2:07:25] answered i am ruth thine handmaid
[2:07:27] spread therefore thy script over thine
[2:07:29] handmaid for thou art and near kinsman
[2:07:39] and he said blessed be thou of the lord
[2:07:41] my daughter for thou has shown more
[2:07:43] kindness
[2:07:43] and thy latter end than at the beginning
[2:07:45] in so much as thou followers not young
[2:07:47] men
[2:07:48] whether poor benito eternal mafia
[2:07:52] sudanese
[2:07:58] and now my daughter fear not i will do
[2:08:00] to the all that thou requires for all
[2:08:02] the city of my people doth know
[2:08:04] that thou art a virtuous woman
[2:08:14] the whole city knew she was a virtuous
[2:08:17] one
[2:08:19] she held
[2:08:34] by the
[2:08:49] thou showed more kindness later than at
[2:08:51] the beginning
[2:08:54] because you didn't follow after young
[2:08:56] men
[2:08:59] she was a young woman she was a weirdo
[2:09:01] woman
[2:09:03] and she wasn't chasing the young man
[2:09:06] but she was going to the older man she
[2:09:09] was going back to the right family
[2:09:12] to the right bloodline because she was
[2:09:15] interested in one thing
[2:09:43] to the world or to the flesh but she was
[2:09:47] going back
[2:09:49] to the original back to the family
[2:09:54] back to the near kinsman that could
[2:09:55] redeem her
[2:09:57] and she was showing her character
[2:10:01] by not chasing young men by not chasing
[2:10:05] all these young ideas
[2:10:08] all this young interpretation and word
[2:10:10] decisions
[2:10:11] she was going back to the word of the
[2:10:13] father's amen
[2:10:14] she was going back to the original word
[2:10:18] she went and laid her feet down
[2:10:21] at the only place of redemption
[2:10:25] was back in the bloodline amen
[2:10:29] back to the place of the father
[2:10:32] and by laying there she was saying
[2:10:36] i'm submitting to you i'm laying at your
[2:10:40] feet
[2:10:51] and it was showing what character she
[2:10:54] had
[2:11:08] there's no beauty if he would have come
[2:11:12] in worldly beauty as satan is today the
[2:11:14] people would have run around him and
[2:11:15] accepted him
[2:11:16] the way they do the church today
[2:11:33] they would have believed him and
[2:11:34] received him as they do satan today
[2:11:49] christ wasn't beautiful great
[2:12:04] to make a king out of jesse's son
[2:12:08] take another king's place
[2:12:13] and so jesse brought him out hello
[2:12:16] his great big fine boy
[2:12:32] and he refused every one of them
[2:12:35] till he come to a little old stoop
[2:12:37] shouldered ready looking fellow
[2:12:39] even
[2:12:43] cool and he poured the oil upon him yeah
[2:12:46] literally and he said god chose him
[2:12:50] see we choose by sight of you
[2:12:53] god choose by character remember when
[2:12:56] jesus had to go by samaria
[2:13:00] there
[2:13:15] she had had five husbands
[2:13:18] and the one she was living with then was
[2:13:19] on her own
[2:13:22] nobody else could see her true character
[2:13:26] they all saw the false characters
[2:13:30] [Applause]
[2:13:36] [Applause]
[2:13:41] was a desire for the truth of god
[2:13:55] but god knew who she was
[2:13:58] and he began to give her the word
[2:14:02] and when he began to give her the words
[2:14:05] she began to respond to the word
[2:14:09] and then she responded to the word
[2:14:25] she didn't say tell me my future
[2:14:29] she didn't say how can i get out of this
[2:14:30] condition
[2:14:32] how can i prosper would she come in
[2:14:35] contact with a prophet
[2:14:37] she wanted to know one thing
[2:14:51] she had a desire
[2:15:05] she didn't want signs and wonders
[2:15:15] [Applause]
[2:15:20] through gifts and miracles but we
[2:15:23] weren't wanting the gifts
[2:15:26] we wanted to give her we wanted to know
[2:15:29] the proper place of worship zombies
[2:15:33] say this
[2:15:46] oh he was he was he was the s she was
[2:15:50] giving discernment
[2:15:53] and he was drawing her in
[2:15:56] and when he told her the proper place of
[2:15:58] worship
[2:16:01] she said when messiah comes he'll tell
[2:16:04] us these things
[2:16:06] can you imagine a woman trapped under
[2:16:08] bad character would we imagine
[2:16:11] character but she was the genuine bride
[2:16:15] she was the real article
[2:16:21] because the religious systems of the day
[2:16:25] had no power to give her a life
[2:16:29] that could overcome that life
[2:17:06] he didn't reveal himself to the priest
[2:17:10] he didn't declare who he was
[2:17:18] the last place the world thought messiah
[2:17:21] would come
[2:17:22] on in samaria to a woman of bad
[2:17:26] characters
[2:17:39] the new birth is a revelation of jesus
[2:17:42] christ to you
[2:17:46] said she was born right there
[2:17:50] he come to her personally
[2:17:53] i'm the messiah
[2:18:36] it was our religion she was going back
[2:18:40] to jacob's well
[2:18:43] and she was dipping water out of that
[2:18:44] old baptist well
[2:18:48] sipping water trying to get life
[2:19:04] she
[2:19:18] she didn't need a little water pot of
[2:19:19] oil of water the people
[2:19:22] she dropped her pot because that voice
[2:19:25] told her
[2:19:27] if you come to me and drink
[2:19:30] i'm the well
[2:19:42] [Applause]
[2:20:02] and she ran into the city and she began
[2:20:05] giving out water
[2:20:08] she didn't need the pot and there people
[2:20:10] said that she didn't need the church
[2:20:12] now she was a fountain
[2:20:23] [Applause]
[2:20:28] because
[2:20:56] he was a head
[2:21:32] and because he kept changing the
[2:21:34] commandment from a prophet
[2:21:37] and changing it to his own
[2:21:52] he gave them a king of their choice but
[2:21:55] now god said i'm going to choose
[2:21:57] my choice and it goes to the house of
[2:22:00] jesus
[2:22:05] and he's powerful he's
[2:22:10] and even samuel thinks this shirley must
[2:22:12] be him
[2:22:13] samuel and he goes with the crews of oil
[2:22:18] and god says no
[2:22:22] [Applause]
[2:22:34] back
[2:22:48] his own
[2:23:01] he's looking for a character i wanted a
[2:23:05] character to be
[2:23:06] king you want a mighty powerful man
[2:23:10] he didn't want a good looking man he
[2:23:13] wanted his king to have his character
[2:23:45] but when he gets the acts
[2:23:48] the phrase that will do all
[2:23:51] my will what is a man after god's own
[2:23:55] heart
[2:23:58] one that will do all his will
[2:24:01] why was jesus christ a perfect
[2:24:02] reflection of god
[2:24:06] only did what pleased the father
[2:24:09] and he only spoke what the father taught
[2:24:54] so when you get to the garden of
[2:24:55] gethsemane don't do
[2:24:57] don't get i guess money jesus is
[2:24:59] wrestling with his own will
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:04] he's surrendering his own human will
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:35] would you please let this cup pass
[2:25:40] god is there any other way you know
[2:25:44] god can there be another path
[2:25:47] and when god said no he said
[2:25:52] according to thy will
[2:25:55] he surrendered his will
[2:25:59] that was the character of christ
[2:26:02] now what kind of character will his
[2:26:04] bride
[2:26:15] we continue to serve our own purpose in
[2:26:17] this world
[2:26:21] [Applause]
[2:26:55] because that's the only character
[2:26:58] that he will join himself akiva
[2:27:11] that lives in you and manifest him
[2:27:14] on it's not worldly beauty of him
[2:27:18] an attractive bride
[2:27:22] it's his character and the character of
[2:27:25] the church that jesus looks for
[2:27:28] is
[2:28:09] to which the modern churches of today
[2:28:11] certainly miss his program
[2:28:16] they miss it a million miles
[2:28:20] because they deny this to be the truth
[2:28:23] so how could it be
[2:29:07] ellie whatever she is skilly he is
[2:29:10] they must be one he's waiting for this
[2:29:14] church to be formed this bride
[2:29:17] for me hebrews 13 8
[2:30:01] and the manifestation of the son of man
[2:30:04] will be made so real that would
[2:30:08] unite the christ and bride again
[2:30:11] but why what is the ministry of the son
[2:30:14] of man supposed to do
[2:30:16] jesus christ
[2:30:31] but it was supposed to accomplish
[2:30:33] something
[2:30:35] there was a purpose behind it
[2:30:38] remember amos so god says i will do
[2:30:42] nothing
[2:30:44] unless i first reveal it to the servants
[2:30:46] the prophets
[2:30:51] so that means the prophets must forerun
[2:30:54] something god's doing
[2:30:58] it's not the completion of what he's
[2:31:00] doing
[2:31:02] it's forerunning what he's doing
[2:31:06] and brother branham was forerunning
[2:31:08] something
[2:31:10] he was forerunning the coming of christ
[2:31:25] so the son of man was revealed
[2:31:41] he said when the word here unites with
[2:31:43] the person
[2:31:46] and they too become one then what does
[2:31:49] it do then
[2:31:51] i pray it manifests the son of man again
[2:31:54] manifest
[2:32:07] [Applause]
[2:32:11] the church does the same thing so what
[2:32:14] was the revealing of the son of man
[2:32:17] it'll come down so powerful
[2:32:20] that'll unite the head and the body as
[2:32:22] one
[2:32:33] let's look at first corinthians together
[2:32:35] i don't know i'm going to ensemble
[2:32:37] we're going to end with this thought
[2:32:40] out of first corinthians 1
[2:32:45] first corinthians chapter 11. i'm going
[2:32:50] to
[2:32:52] we understand this is the chapter the
[2:32:54] prophet or the paul talks about here
[2:33:02] but i want you to pay attention to what
[2:33:03] he says
[2:33:13] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[2:33:15] head for as much as he is the image
[2:33:17] and glory of god but the woman is the
[2:33:19] glory
[2:33:20] of the man
[2:33:23] [Music]
[2:33:30] the man is the glory of god love
[2:33:34] the jew christ was the glory of the
[2:33:37] father
[2:33:37] christ but the woman
[2:33:41] is the glory of the man what's the glory
[2:33:45] of christ
[2:33:46] where
[2:33:58] and the kind of woman he chooses
[2:34:12] and becomes his glory
[2:34:19] said in the message it is the rising of
[2:34:21] the sun
[2:34:26] he said people are trying to say wash
[2:34:28] feet once a year on thursday
[2:34:34] and on friday we should take communion
[2:34:38] all different doctrines they argue
[2:34:41] whether it should be this day or that
[2:34:42] day
[2:34:42] is
[2:35:09] but they have certainly carried out
[2:35:10] their traditions
[2:35:22] listen friends do me a favor
[2:35:25] don't put this out in denominations now
[2:35:29] don't put it in the denomination
[2:35:32] bring it right here in the mess
[2:35:36] bring it right to your own life to
[2:35:51] because you believe god sent a prophet
[2:35:56] believing god sent a prophet doesn't
[2:35:57] make you bride
[2:36:01] god choosing you and becoming one with
[2:36:05] you makes you proud
[2:36:06] if if
[2:37:01] he wasn't a sabbath only son of god
[2:37:05] brother branham was not a part-time son
[2:37:07] of god
[2:37:11] he wasn't a sunday and wednesday son of
[2:37:13] god
[2:37:16] but
[2:37:18] [Applause]
[2:37:35] [Applause]
[2:37:41] he wants a bride that's always a bride
[2:37:55] [Applause]
[2:38:07] [Applause]
[2:38:08] [Music]
[2:38:25] it didn't change when he was in the
[2:38:27] jungles in africa
[2:38:29] he had the same character the character
[2:38:33] of christ
[2:38:35] that's the only kind of bride he's
[2:38:37] uniting with in this day
[2:38:39] of the farmer
[2:38:53] this is not the day for part-time
[2:38:55] christians
[2:38:57] but god is looking for all the time
[2:39:02] that your private life is christian
[2:39:06] your work life is christian your school
[2:39:17] [Applause]
[2:39:34] amen and that's the kind of bride he's
[2:39:36] looking for jean
[2:39:38] one that will reflect his character
[2:39:42] no matter where you're at
[2:39:45] that's the bride of christ don't be
[2:39:48] deceived
[2:39:50] coming to
[2:40:04] that go read the token message
[2:40:09] he says you say i believe every word you
[2:40:11] preach brother
[2:40:14] he said that's not it yet he said you
[2:40:17] must take it
[2:40:18] you
[2:40:31] the message is
[2:40:47] is the life of jesus christ
[2:40:53] the message is not god sent a prophet
[2:40:56] that was the forerunner to the message
[2:41:00] the
[2:41:12] the message is a living episode
[2:41:27] you can't say i believe the message
[2:41:29] because i believe brother brennan was a
[2:41:30] prophet
[2:41:33] the message is the life of jesus christ
[2:41:38] in the formation of a bride in the end
[2:41:42] times
[2:41:54] [Music]
[2:41:56] anything
[2:42:20] [Applause]
[2:43:19] that's what he is
[2:43:34] and
[2:43:47] when i look around the message
[2:44:02] church what good is coming to church if
[2:44:05] you have no life
[2:44:10] coming the church is good but if you
[2:44:13] have no lives
[2:44:16] i
[2:44:53] here's what he said satan doesn't care
[2:44:54] how religious you are
[2:44:57] or how right you are in your doctrine
[2:45:01] if you miss that life you won't come up
[2:45:04] anyhow
[2:45:06] there'll be no resurrection
[2:45:10] no matter how religious
[2:45:14] how many churches you belong to
[2:45:18] it doesn't matter one thing unless
[2:45:20] you've been born again
[2:45:24] unless that token life is in you
[2:45:33] let's go down a little further in first
[2:45:34] corinthians 11.
[2:45:39] now we know that the glory of the man is
[2:45:41] the woman
[2:45:44] she's the reflection of the man so the
[2:45:47] glory of christ is his bride
[2:45:51] but what's the glory of the woman
[2:45:54] verse 15. but if a woman have long hair
[2:45:58] it is a glory to her for her hair is
[2:46:00] given her
[2:46:01] for a covering me
[2:46:08] unique
[2:46:12] her long hair
[2:46:16] is a glory unto her
[2:46:19] the woman is the glory of the man the
[2:46:20] family
[2:46:22] but what's the woman's glory her long
[2:46:25] hair
[2:46:27] because brother branham said hair to a
[2:46:29] woman
[2:46:33] is her nazarite vow
[2:46:36] and what is the nazarite vowel
[2:46:40] it's a vowel of consecration
[2:46:44] under a nazarite vowel
[2:46:47] the nazirite wouldn't cut his hair
[2:46:50] it wasn't the length of the hair
[2:46:53] it was that it was not cut
[2:46:56] and when he didn't cut his hair he
[2:46:59] showed that he was in the vow with god
[2:47:17] so what is what is the glory of the
[2:47:20] woman
[2:47:21] it's her long hair
[2:47:24] so what is the glory of the bride
[2:47:28] her consecration to god
[2:47:32] her glory is her nazarite vow
[2:47:36] the glory of the bride is her separation
[2:47:39] from everything of the world
[2:47:43] and all denominational ideas
[2:47:47] and she's consecrated only to one secret
[2:47:50] and that's the christ the word and
[2:47:53] that is the glory of the bride
[2:47:58] the bride is the glory of the man of
[2:48:00] christ
[2:48:15] this is the last scripture i want to
[2:48:18] read
[2:48:20] i told you genesis 24 was what brother
[2:48:22] branham started
[2:48:23] the message choosing of a bride
[2:49:00] and they're coming they're coming to me
[2:49:02] one of the seven angels which had the
[2:49:03] seven vials full of the seven last
[2:49:05] plagues
[2:49:06] and talked with me saying come hither i
[2:49:08] will show thee the bride
[2:49:10] the lamb's wife we own this sit down
[2:49:22] brother venom started choosing of a
[2:49:24] bride with these two scriptures
[2:49:29] showing that he's a liaison
[2:49:32] and he's calling a bride but the bride
[2:49:35] has to be able to receive revelation
[2:49:37] from god
[2:49:43] and that there's going to be a
[2:49:46] revelation
[2:49:48] by one of the angels having one of the
[2:49:51] seven vials
[2:50:07] i wonder which angel would be the one to
[2:50:09] show us
[2:50:12] who's the brightest wife
[2:50:16] because that's what brother branham was
[2:50:17] doing in choosing of a bride
[2:50:21] he goes on here and says in verse 10.
[2:50:25] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[2:50:26] a great and high mountain showed me that
[2:50:28] great city in holy jerusalem descending
[2:50:30] out of heaven from god
[2:50:44] having the glory of god and her light
[2:50:46] was like unto a stone most precious even
[2:50:48] like a jasper stone clears crystal
[2:50:50] sonita
[2:50:55] transparent and it goes on to describe
[2:50:58] it continue this pyramid
[2:51:02] city see this pyramid city
[2:51:07] and it's the description given here
[2:51:10] that's the seventh angel that one of the
[2:51:12] seven angels to
[2:51:14] learn to sit on the song now
[2:51:17] showing the bride
[2:51:21] but when john looked he saw a city
[2:51:27] because this pyramid-shaped city
[2:51:40] [Applause]
[2:51:43] christ himself
[2:52:23] and each individual stone is part of
[2:52:26] this city
[2:52:38] but the only way for the light to get
[2:52:40] out of the city
[2:53:08] from where through the city
[2:53:11] through the stones do not appear through
[2:53:13] your life
[2:53:15] you must be a pure stone to shine the
[2:53:18] light
[2:53:19] you mean so when the seventh angel allah
[2:53:24] that has one of the seven vials
[2:53:27] says i will show you
[2:53:31] the bride the lamb's wife
[2:53:34] he begins to show the city
[2:53:38] and he begins to preach future home
[2:53:43] because if you come down to verse 16
[2:53:48] it says in the city lieth foursquare and
[2:53:50] the length is as large as the breadth
[2:53:52] and the measure of the city with the
[2:53:54] reed
[2:53:54] twelve thousand furlongs the length and
[2:53:56] the breadth and the height of it are
[2:53:58] equal
[2:53:59] de la villavilla formed
[2:54:10] he measured the wall there of 144 cubits
[2:54:12] according to the measure of a man
[2:54:14] that is of the angel is
[2:54:31] and he tells us that this is 1200
[2:54:34] cubits
[2:54:37] i'm sorry 12 000 furlongs
[2:54:41] for 16. 12 000 furlongs
[2:54:49] and the length and the breath and the
[2:54:51] height of it are equal
[2:54:55] and when brother branham comes to the
[2:54:56] scripture
[2:54:59] he begins to say it's not a
[2:55:16] and he's revealing to us the bride
[2:55:19] the lamb's wife and he's showing it in
[2:55:22] city form
[2:55:24] and he said there's another measurement
[2:55:27] where the length and the height and the
[2:55:29] breath are equal
[2:55:32] it's not a cube it's a pyramid
[2:55:36] and this pyramid is the new jerusalem
[2:55:40] and brother begins showing future homes
[2:55:50] angel have to give you the dimensions
[2:55:53] and he says it's fifteen hundred miles
[2:55:55] this way
[2:56:14] and he says an interesting statement
[2:56:18] he said that would be about from maine
[2:56:21] to florida
[2:56:25] and from the east coast to
[2:56:28] uh i think he said the uh someplace in
[2:56:31] canada
[2:56:33] past the mississippi river
[2:56:36] i think he says saskatchewan
[2:56:40] and he's looking at people in his
[2:56:41] congregation
[2:56:44] that have come from those areas
[2:56:46] [Music]
[2:56:48] and he says about what we have right
[2:56:50] here
[2:56:51] this morning
[2:57:02] because you've come from maine and from
[2:57:04] florida
[2:57:07] you from saskatchewan oh right here
[2:57:10] and brother branham was showing us
[2:57:13] that the present home
[2:57:16] is showing the future
[2:57:19] where god was living
[2:57:32] [Applause]
[2:57:46] and then the fire is going to fall to
[2:57:48] burn it off
[2:57:51] to make it a fit place for christ and
[2:57:53] his bride to live together
[2:57:58] and the whole time he's talking about
[2:57:59] the redemption of the earth
[2:58:15] and the blood was you were washed in the
[2:58:17] blood of jesus christ
[2:58:20] and then the fire of the holy ghost come
[2:58:22] and burnt you out
[2:58:26] making you a fit place for christ and
[2:58:29] his bride to live together in
[2:59:04] you are the one that's been adorned for
[2:59:07] christ
[2:59:09] you've been adorned under the ministry
[2:59:11] of haggai
[2:59:25] you've been perfumed by the anointing of
[2:59:27] the holy ghost
[2:59:30] [Applause]
[2:59:32] and now presented to christ and united
[2:59:35] with christ
[2:59:37] and now you're the reflection of his
[2:59:40] life
[2:59:54] because that's what the future holds
[2:59:58] it's going to be like brother branham
[3:00:01] comes to the middle part of choosing a
[3:00:03] bride
[3:00:06] at the beginning he talks about that
[3:00:07] earthquake would
[3:00:22] he said it could come this way
[3:00:26] if the lord ever tells me i'll reveal it
[3:00:28] to you
[3:00:30] then he comes to the middle of his
[3:00:31] message
[3:00:33] he starts talking about when he was on
[3:00:35] the mountain
[3:00:47] and the next day that thing came down
[3:00:52] and it blasted three times
[3:00:55] and cut the rocks out of the tree yeah
[3:00:58] and every rock was in a pyramid shape
[3:01:03] and then he said a couple days from that
[3:01:05] it went up to alaska
[3:01:08] and nearly sank alaska
[3:01:12] started that earthquake and then it's
[3:01:15] come down to washington
[3:01:18] and now at the end of choosing of a
[3:01:20] bride
[3:01:22] now remember there's two scriptures
[3:01:23] brother branham reads at the beginning
[3:01:27] are choosing a bride and the vile angel
[3:01:31] the judgment angel dude showing the
[3:01:35] pride the lamb's wife
[3:01:39] and he comes to the end of that message
[3:01:42] and god takes over his voice
[3:01:45] it says o capernaum capernaum
[3:01:50] thou city that exalted self above the
[3:01:52] angels
[3:01:55] thou shalt be brought down to hell
[3:01:58] and he prophesies of the destruction of
[3:02:01] los angeles
[3:02:04] and a huge earthquake that'll shake the
[3:02:07] earth
[3:02:09] what was he doing he was playing the
[3:02:11] role of the seventh angel
[3:02:27] you rejected every other woman
[3:02:37] and that rejection was signified by a
[3:02:39] prophet
[3:02:53] that was going to bring a destruction to
[3:02:55] the world
[3:03:03] [Applause]
[3:03:09] he doesn't choose and all that was not
[3:03:12] chosen to be bride
[3:03:15] was doomed to destruction
[3:03:19] choosing of a bride is wonderful
[3:03:22] if you're the bride
[3:03:37] that i can say by revelation
[3:03:49] i was no different than mary magdalene
[3:03:51] that had seven devils
[3:04:32] and christ come and said i'm the one
[3:04:34] who's speaking to you
[3:04:36] it's not the man i'm from kentucky it's
[3:04:39] not the man in jeffersonville

[3:05:05] soul

[3:05:09] ghost to unlock that character
[3:05:13] and that character is a reflection of
[3:05:15] his own character

[3:05:42] of gethsemane
[3:06:02] [Applause]
[3:06:11] to shine your light out of this stone

[3:06:21] be on this one

[3:06:37] but god we know you're looking for a
[3:06:40] character
[3:07:23] they will give up their lives
[3:07:26] so that they can be a full-time bride
[3:07:29] so that they can reflect your character
[3:07:33] everywhere
