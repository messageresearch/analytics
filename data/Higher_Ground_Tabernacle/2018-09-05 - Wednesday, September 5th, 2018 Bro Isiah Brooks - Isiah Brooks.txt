the beloved hallelujah is not by works lest any man should boast but is by the grace of God I am so grateful cuz none of us would make it if we had to produce that kind of work but thank God that he worked for us and all we have to do is believe in trust in what he has done for us and then God will do the rest amen gillich Florida brother Troy such a nice man a wonderful message I don't like to use the word nice it was more than that it was powerful because of him Preston on my heart and it gave me some wonderful thoughts and so I I just went home and then I just let God work with me on on some more I hope it's a blessing you trust that it will be one but as we stand let us turn to Matthew the sixth out of the third chapter Matt through three and we're going to read the 16th through the splinting verse amen so glad to have our brother Samuel bad I like to hear that corner talk to me even we appreciate him and thank God for His goodness brother I've been so busy my apology I didn't forget about you I should have called you though but you know God has been so good to us and I want you to understand by God's grace faith is not something that you put off that's hope I'm hoping God faith is now now faith is not anything is not now is hope I even I even text a friend of mine and sent him a little thought and I talked because he's a he needs healing and I show that you've been hoping well I know God is going to do it it says is done it is the now thing and what people don't understand is that faith is something God gives you you can't mentally believe this it is something that God must drop in your heart otherwise you're gonna be struggling with stuff that you you're not going to accomplish anything you're hoping and the Bible doesn't say then hope please God the Bible says faith so if you don't have to faith who you ask you ask God for it it is a gift from God Matthew the 3rd chapter I so loved the Lord this is a time when Satan is trying to distract the true believers of God and he's doing whatever he can do to upset you or to make you feel if art is forgotten about you now you can believe Goliath preaching if you like but as Goliath preached to David David returned preach to Goliath and God like I said I'm gonna kill you and then you must be mistaken this day I have the victory and he began to preach back to Goliath but amplifying it in other words I'm the one that's gonna kill you and I'm the one that's gonna take your head off and I don't even have a sword to do it but I'm gonna take your sword and take your head off right the very words you have spoken to me I'm gonna speak them back to you but the word in which I speak won't come back boy that's how you had to preach to the devil you're a preacher reach back to him Matthew 3:16 through 17 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lightening on him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased let us pray father we come before your Lord and we thank you for your grace your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord your heart fixed on a mine regulator and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name for your love and grace and mercy that you bestow upon us each and every day thank you dear Jesus let your glory be seen in this place tonight reveal your word to our hearts and may it follow God on good ground that it may bring forth a hundredfold in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated trusting the Lord to deliver this as always may he give us grace to move completely out of his way I thought about the nature of God and when I and as I thought about the nature of God I thought about God how he symbolizes his nature with certain animals and certain characteristics it's kind of like what our brother Troy was bringing how God liken himself as a dove and a lamb and we know that I would have entitled it the nature of God is like unto a dove now but I'm going to hit other characteristics too but I want to reuse the Dove because that's the nature we must have if we're going to make a rapture we must have the same anointing that anointed Jesus even though he was a lion in me and a brother was talking about that the other day can you imagine if the priest had to catch a lion and sacrifice a lion and can you imagine the struggles they would have had if they had to make sure that there was no spot or blemish hey I thought that was pretty good but God needed something with no resistance whoo I love it and he knew that he could not send no one else outside of himself because really in his creation there should have been no resistance but we find out that when he created Lucifer Lucifer was the first to resist and according to the message Amen we understand that Lucifer was like God's right hand he was a a covering cherub beautiful the most beautiful angel in heaven that's why we know that that's where evil lies in beauty when we think about goddess as a dove and we know he is the word David said he's my battle axe he he he's mine and we think about how the god in this last day completed the message with a dove he started it with the dumb because when Jesus were baptized unto the Jordan right he was identified by John because of the light that came down like a dove and when the prophet of God came to a place where the was complete he was visited by a snow-white girl he calls it the seventh dove and we realize by God's grace in order for us to make a rapture we must bear the same spirit and God must say to us I'm we're pleased to dwell within you when we think about a dog we think about the innocence because a dove is innocent I used to eat them years ago but I didn't know any better but I do know why I believe the Lord allowed me to eat them because they were sweet and I want to say it like this the reason why it was so sweet because that's the way I look at Jesus and in order to understand what I'm saying that same dog must be eaten it wasn't just a sacrifice but that sacrifice was eaten and dog meat is sweet it's innocent because he doesn't have gall there's nothing bitter about it you know how some meats you can eat in it you got to be careful cuz there's a part that just doesn't taste as good but the dog has no goal is like our liver we have a liver that literally cleanses our blood gall battling all of that working together to keep it clean but you see that's because we eat unclean things but a dog eats no unclean thing he doesn't need a gall he doesn't need inside anything to purify himself because he is pure and clean inside matter of fact he's so clean inside he it washes the outside now when it comes to a job you always think about gentleness you think about kinder Ness we take a piece and we can see that in a dog but you got to understand if the Dove is in us we must see that in us when we talk about a dove like I said we talk about gentle an innocent person or a tender person that's what the Bobbie said about Jesus God the great this man on earth came down and likened himself to a dog understand a man when it came to the dog when he was offered up as a sin offering it wasn't sliced or cut in two because the Holy Ghost is not divided the same Holy Ghost they had in the Old Testament it's the same Holy Ghost they have in the new he is the same yesterday today and forever and you and I ought to be a reflection of this dog and the reflection is an image or a representation or a counterpart in the physic realm it is the very the return of light or heat or sound y'all know them so about have you ever had a are a piece of metal and you take that metal and you let the Sun hit it and the heat of that metal will reflect from the metal to you or let's put it this way have you ever had what we call a spyglass one of those speaking what they call them now they take that thing and you let that spirit that that that heat from the Sun focused amen and all of a sudden you can you can set something on fire hallelujah maybe that's what we need tonight we need a glass amen they can take that Sun and let it begin down you know gets our souls of fire when Jesus when they saw Jesus and you know they didn't know who he was but John did and John Dean said behold the tub of God he said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world but you got to understand there was a dog leading the lake hallelujah and when that dog came down the lujah and feel that body called Jesus he was led into the wilderness forty days and there he conquered the devil hallelujah so what I'm trying to tell you in that when the Holy Ghost comes you becomes a conqueror that duh you conquer by the dog dumb Oh somebody I innocent down a little bird that that has no fight in it and that's how you conquer you understand what I'm saying I'm working with something so you can understand Amen that we don't conquer and then by physical means we don't even conquer by feeling like we're great hallelujah yeah so did you understand when we look at these things and you see well what about this lamb what about this done because they had nature's that were compatible as brother Troy brought up amen when you when you're working with that that dog that nature of a lamb Amen that devil come down and light in on you hallelujah but when you try that lamb into a goat but I believe the word of God but I believe it meant God is gonna answer prayer but see that little that dog takes his flight because your nature has changed you can't object to anything God says it must be amen either you like it or not remember amen in the fifth chapter of Revelation when the lamb John wept and began to cry and he didn't know what to do because he saw always good was lost and John knew he wasn't worthy to open the book he wasn't really worthy to loose the seals there are but the Bible says it meant that there was a mighty angel a strong angel said we'd not for the Lion of the tribe of Judah now watch this he was once a lamb on earth but now he's a lion in heaven but how was the transformation how was that lion changed into a I mean i'd like that let that lamb change into a lion or the lion turn into a lamb however you want to look at it but it was God amen displaying his attributes through animals because the lamb was the weakest of all creatures but the lion he's the king of all creatures hallelujah he was transformed from a lion to a lamb from a lamb to a lion is that right Wow you see what brother was what are you saying you are Lions but God had right this point in time wants you to be a leg priests and kings hallelujah weep not for the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David he has prevailed I understand what he's saying the root of David that means two strengths of David not beginning of David whatever David was came from the root and that root came from the seed hallelujah understand by God's grace he said listen the root of David he had prevailed a man conquered in other words he's worthy to take the book and Garson let that Holy Ghost be in you as it was in Christ Jesus if that same spirit being you as it quickened his body it will also quicken yours hallelujah and the Bible tells us those who overcome this age will sit in my throne even as I've said in my father's throne that means as God gave him rulership he then gives you rulership it's worth fighting for it's worth dying out to don't let this moment pass you by people looking at me because of the things that's happening with my children and let me tell you something I am not discouraged one bit I am you're not gonna see with my face all hung down on my head hung down in my face no sir I will fear no evil because God is with me and whatever God gives you no man can take it from you I don't know what all they got to go through but they're mine and that's Moses said I'll not leave one hook behind don't look at me like I'm supposed to be crying hallelujah but I'm shouting the victory already it ain't if now faith what I'm trying to say Amen there times when you have to start you know fighting you are lamb but let the lion come out a little bit remember he has seen him up to this why he was sharing a seat are thrown in there God's throne he was only inside of his sanctuary listen and he hadn't seen him to this time so John was expecting to see a limb a lion come forth but he saw a lamb come on somebody what do you mean he was expecting see a lion but you see when we look at a lion we accept we expect the fierceness we re expecting I'm gonna take this I'm gonna try up over this by my power by my might but let me give you me read something to you but this lion didn't fight that way and she said there you are brothers through meekness through sweetness through the holy spirit that we conquer not some great mighty intellectual giant but he that can humble himself is the man who conquers the man who can can be kicked around and still be a servant of Christ that's the Conqueror did they all know I'm taking this and oh well you give it to me imma give it back to you that is not the characteristics that God is looking for he's looking for somebody who can take the BT hello because because of the beating it's because of who is who why I am Who I am hello amen come on somebody cold try it in the fire and you know what when that gold is taking out is this beating you got to take the beating you don't resist the beating the beating is get all the dross out of you that's why I thank God for what's happening in my life right now it looks like a beating and I thank God it is a beating but it's getting all of the dross out of my life out of my life I'm taking advantage of this beating you don't even know your back slid into trouble come who you don't even know that you're your prayer life is not what it should be or your fasting or your reading or your your consecration everything ought to be an honor some time God got a little beating come awakening up to you hallelujah so that you can see that you got stuff in your life you gotta get out take God for His grace in his motion I don't mean the screen but I'm excited I'm excited because I can see what God is doing whoo now let's se he has prevailed and he's worthy to take the book and to open it and to loose the seals thereof I know shoot you can't be there and kill your name's where where was your name sow in the Lamb's Book of Life not the lion book align the Lambs look alive no oh come on Sonic not even in the dog book of life you gotta be a lamb hallelujah and that lamb must be compatible to the dog how because the dove is gonna lead you the footsteps of a righteous man are led by the Lord hallelujah it is the Lord's doing hallelujah is that right salvation is of the Lord not you and that old devil say oh you know you so far behind the Lord is soon to come that's true but I got a promise philippians 1:16 said being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ hallelujah if the walk is started he's here to finish him God is not a slack man he will finish the work is that right oh and I slapped the devil tonight I slapped him with 2nd Corinthians 8 11 12 it says now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness of will so there may be a performer's also out of that which you have but if there be a will first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man have and not according to that he hath not hallelujah I have a willing mind I have a desire to be perfect hallelujah sure like my lord and he it is up to the Holy Spirit to bring me to that perfection it's already accepted if I die now I go to heaven if I die now I'll be included in the bride ah because my desire is to be perfect just like yeah before I hit the floor brother rich my perfection will be right there he said it if you got a Willie mine it's already counted as being done whoo thank God for the willing life not him that Willie or he that run it all run it but God this shows mercy but see you can't have a will mine until God gives it to you I'm not talking a human willing to my God's will mm the nature's of God how can it be a lion and also a lamb hmm you got to go back to Isaiah ain't got to realize Amen that Isaiah he said the lion and the lamb laid down together they was fighting not one of them wanted to eat each other that was before the fall so he's got to bring your nature back before the fall till you have the kind of nature that had in the beginning that's why the Bible said you gotta love your enemy love your brother hey somebody why because that nature that God gives you you I've never seen a door fight have you ever seen a dog fight and we ever seen a lamb Lambs you I don't know about them but have you seen him fight now I mean you get around nine another round come yeah they don't get you I kind of like those RAM but you gotta watch him those Rams will RAM you they did not call around for nothing right and you think about the lion a man is the king of the jungle that means he's king over all the animals even the crickets hush when he roars he is a shadow and a type of God the Lord is in his holy temple what you're supposed to do keep silent that all the earth keep silent what that means when he's in his temple you don't have one word you don't have a say so he's in his temple he's the one that speak you listen you obey Oh somebody help me limbs like I said it's a Mekas of all I'm getting back to the Dove in just a moment it has no real defense system no sense of leadership he is a follower by nature it's considered a dumb animal see a lot of us that's what's wrong with a lot of people in the message I thought my god I said we need to just establish an institution amen so that you know everybody can get a higher and a deeper understanding of the message see that's what the denominations did that's exactly what they did instead of getting the people to the Holy Ghost they wanted to get them to a greater intellectual of it why God isn't gonna do us if we have not been born again is that right God came right on down to a man who was so smart by the name of Nicodemus a Pharisee who had it all intellectually wrapped up in his own little scroll Nicodemus you must be born again and he just says something real simple to the Pharisees and all the same except you believe that I am he you should likewise dying your sin if you don't believe Holy Ghost is God you're going to die in your sins and you need to know that the Holy Ghost meet built you for one purpose that he may occupy your body didn't bill you amen your body for nothing else but his holiness y'all believe that now you know I know that if a lamb have a lamb and a limb have a baby it's going to be a lamb you've never seen a sheep have a goat but now the way they're doing things now I don't know what might happen down the road but in his natural order every seed bring forth of his kind I love the scripture says for in him we live and move and have our being in him you can't even get out of him is that right that's what that's what the psalmist said he's David said if I if I take the weeds of a dull and fried to the uttermost part of the earth now are they if I make my bed in hell thou art there so if he's in hell he's on earth though you can't get away he is you're the very breath that you have is operated by him and as soon as he twists to flip the switch and said that's enough I don't care it's over just give me five more years yeah hmm and you and I must understand does this devil got it like I told you I preached last week or life right I preached on showed you there's another life I'm living to live huh how do you wanna say it oh I'm dying to live he's away I'm doing it to live and there's a better life than this one this life was was cloaked by SLUSA for the devil in the beginning and told Eve you gonna have a better life if you do what I do you're gonna know good and even it's gonna be better than what you got better look what we're dealing with now and the devil does the same thing to you let me tell you something nothing's gonna make you happy I don't can't listen that's what the truth sometimes people get excited oh that cheeping man I haven't ceased I'm like the woman in the world and the way of five or six what was she thirsting for Jesus met her at the well because he knew what she was thirsting for and then she thought I could find this thing in a minute I don't care you can sleep a million times with him you'll never find peace back it ain't there women is a woman either it ain't all in the money or the show y'all know what I'm saying there's only one person who can feel that whole feel that dog's body in your life and that's Jesus Christ alone nobody can feel that no alcohol no drugs no reefer no cocaine crack heroin whatever you still lack there's only one piece that piece that that God is is the only one can fit that spot happiness don't come in this world not the kind God gives you and everybody want to be happy right remember Amen those people up there in in Canada and here they were up there having a good time and probably God comes off the elevator here's to women halfway dress both of them embarrassed oh this is life shoulda never said that he grabbed both on now remember brother barely know big tall name he's a short fella isn't he grab both of them no this ain't life that's death that you try to do that this day you'd be in trouble but being led by the Holy Spirit he was letting them know and they supposed to be Christians Sunday School teachers with wedding rings husband home babysitting but that was life to do he said that's not life that's dead outside of Christ there is no life and you can be in this message 30 40 years like the brother and believe it's true but if you're not born again if you don't get the dumb life on the inside if the Holy Ghost don't come down into your heart you lost that can't be oh yes it is Israeli men followed and it was with there in the wilderness how many years 40 and they all died out there they never crossed over into the Promised Land they never got into Canaan and Canaan will represents the Holy Ghost oh I got the Holy Ghost in this peace and joy forever more that's when you fight you haven't even felt good until you get the Holy Ghost it's just okay David was a mighty mighty warrior God reflecting the Holy Spirit and David in the Psalms 23 says the Lord is my shepherd that we don't need we take that and we like that that point you know the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you know know how he said he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and we don't even realize sometime what we say when the Lord is your Shepherd this is deep this is really deep that means I don't leave myself I follow I am a sheep right cuz Shepherds herd sheep and I am a follower of the Lord that right he maketh me he doesn't even ask me he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters is that right you want to be deep that's how deep God take you right there by the steel waters because the steel waters run deep hallelujah he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake he's not taking me to the club or to the jute dog or some wicked place he's leaving me in the right path of righteousness any kind of leadership does not righteousness is of the devil doesn't matter who well yes I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I will fear no evil ain't no use and you fear and evil in this world this is the shadow of death hallelujah ain't no use of fear and evil for what you more than a conquerer that's what Paul said I believe it ha because I got the Conqueror inside he will keep me humble when I need to be humble he'll keep me meek when I need to be meeting ah Amen anyhow so you're not look around with your old lord you see a lot of time when we get messed up is because we try to lead the Shepherd but she can lead the Shepherd you know what she follows sheep and that's what people don't understand what I didn't influence that person to do that I didn't yes you did when you came here dressed like that some sheep saw you and they said well if they can dress like that so can i oh if they see you in the street somewhere and you're doing something got no hey she follows sheep in one sheep jump off a cliff if the Shepherd ain't there all them will jump one out the other commits suicide and that's what a lot of Christians do they commit suicide by following somebody else outside of the shepherd mmm I'll prepare the table before me in the presence of my enemies now I'm known as my hair with oil my cup runneth over surely oh it's true how way I'm going overseas and you know and we go on swimming amen and we try to find a nice place to go swimming and they look at me be called believe us they look at me because I got on the full armor I don't care what I ain't putting on your socks long washed heart ain't doing it ain't gone without a shirt forget it I don't care people think I am a sheep hello really because you know what keeps me it's not following other people in the message what keeps me is following the Shepherd My Lord Jesus Christ somebody helped me see you and I must understand David when he was writing this thing about the Lord is my shepherd he understood because he was a shepherd is that right first semi or 17 34 through 7 and he said David said in the saw thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and I took a lamb out of the flood and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smoked him and delivered him out of the his mouth and when he rose a rose against me I called him by the beard and smoked him and slew him here was a shepherd following a shepherd but the Shepherd was allowed I need some tissue so you look at these things they were proud approach what are you saying though he be a lamb he's also a lion so there is no fear hello of the adversary it's ok there is no fear the nature of God's nature when he's time for you to be a lamb you are lamb when he's time for you to be a lion you are lying the dual nature if I want to say like that is in you but understand we concur Amen by yielding to the Holy Spirit and letting God lead us O Lord wherever you leave me I'll follow you better be careful if you don't really mean that because God will lead you into some dark places and expect you to trust him is that right those Shepherds amen they had to find green pastures green pastures wasn't everywhere hallelujah that's why they talk about the eye of a needle and why it was such a crack in everything else and that Campbell had to get down on his knees to cross through there but in the shadow of all that that's where a lot of people were robbed man hiding in the shadow just waiting on you but the Shepherd goes before you an animal might be hiding there waiting on you but the Shepherd goes before you die rod and thy staff they comfort me I get comfort from the word baa because that word will protect me hallelujah come on somebody when you have faith in God the word will protect you it is your defense the greatest offense God could give you was his word hallelujah when that devil took gzip up on the mountain and up on the pinnacle and everything and it was tempting him he didn't say don't you know I've got all power no sir he said it is written what was he doing just being a lamb following the Shepherd's instructions and when you follow the Shepherd's instruction and you take the word of God and speak it with authority God will make it come to pass I was telling the brothers the other day I said there's more than one way to cry out to God right so I'm a cry out to the Lord but you got seat listen Peter was walking on the water God beat me to come he be getting to see all the waves and everything dashing at him all the Lord Jesus helped me right but he wasn't crying out in faith he was fearful get God responded why cuz Peter was he is and God beat him to come hallelujah when Moses dealt with their Amen in the children of Israel and surrounding him all this fear atmosphere care died not Moses Moses Moses what to do bridges out here to die was wasn't he caught the atmosphere of fear he began to cry himself and God said why are you crying I've given you the authority I've given you the word he did not he wasn't crying out in faith he was crying out in fear cuz Pharaoh was coming after him and God had to shake him up bring him back to himself and say why cries Moses speak the word sometime God has to do us like that hallelujah but there was another crying out brother and that was showing me in the whale hallelujah and all he saw was wails baby wails baby wails many hallelujah but he remembered what the prophets saying if I would turn myself toward Jerusalem and pray now he didn't know where he lost but the well knew ha and the Whale mister heart is crying and turned him towards Jerusalem he prayed and God answered the prayer that's what I'm talking about sometimes you don't know which way to turn but that Holy Spirit know the way to turn you hmm we're talking about the nature of God hallelujah you and if anybody knows anything God wants you understand me God any need he's God is that right even Solomon said that Lord everything I give everything I got I got it from you and I'm giving back to you what you gave to me hallelujah is that right so have you got everything why don't you have it because you gotta believe John adds with crisis John and with cry if you really got the Holy Ghost you are John egg if you have watermelon in your refrigerator and you don't go get it and it spoiled that's your own fault it's in there take some effort go get it Oh help us Jesus it's just okay I'm trying to hurry move over listen I want you to understand when it comes a mint David David says now listen excuse I'm sorry yes he did he said now listen this he talks all the server's flew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be one of them seeing he has defied the name of the Living God and that's exactly what the devil is doing with the church and with the bride if I could put it this way she's become powerless because of the lack of faith hallelujah I so thank God that the church the bride of Jesus Christ is not a group the bride of Jesus Christ are individuals I'm not looking at a group I'm looking at individuals power houses those who's got the Holy Ghost and know the goddess those of us who have been been trained they meant to walk the word like those those are great warriors down there when they came to make David King they said they said that they didn't they knew how to work the left hand in the right day they were battling both of them what was that the whole Testament and the new battling taking the devil's head off us and that's what the problem is you know you get people now to say they're Christians and don't know Matthew 28:19 or less acts 2:38 about John 3:16 you know they don't know it but they say they love God they say they want to go to heaven they say they want and don't give God that much time of their day help us Lord you gotta be born again if you're not born again you won't give God none of your time but if you born again you can't get away from him mmm is that Alright now we look at this day knows syan that bring forth good tiding get the up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringeth forth good tidings lift up that voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say into the cities of jeho Judah behold your God Zion lift up your voice saying to the cities behold your God where is he behold your God he's a man behold the Lord God would come with strong hand and his arms a rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him who is his arm Christ Jesus he's doing the work he's the one that works in you he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he should gather his lambs with his arms and carried them in where his bosom is he carrying you in his bosom that means you protected in the front in the pad on the side wherever you are enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard who is the stand that Christ in you and guess what you don't have to get hungry God will always feed you need help here fee and sometimes I said Lord just show me something in here that's gonna help me throughout the day hallelujah I don't believe just flip and flip and flipping but when he leaves me here sometime I had to read certain thing but when I get to the portion he wants me to have it just illuminates there is hallelujah he fed me he feeds me whenever I asked for Brad he doesn't give me a shock but hallelujah understand we serve the mighty God he's a mighty god I love it hey I love it I love it I love it no weapon against thee shall prosper y'all bleed that didn't say it said no how many of us don't understand the word no no no matter what the enemy says see you calm down you go to a place and then you go to a place a many and then Satan a man is Satan gets you a place a man that he he tries to conquer you and instead of paddling you run whosoever will that means rich or poor maybe you couldn't afford a lamb but you could get some turtle doves that's what it was all about some people could afford lambs lands were expensive but they can get some turtle doves right and before they start selling them in the temple they had to get their home so in turtle doves were birds that you could catch you didn't have to go to the marketplace to buy them lambs you had to buy them turtle doves were free birds and you could go catch you a couple of turtle dogs they meant for sacrifice come on some honey cause your poor God would provide himself a sacrifice did y'all know that you so all what do you mean when the prophet of God saw that self thug he said up in the mountain he said where did it come from he left you he left the answer up to you he said where did it come from the same kind of setting with the same kind of setting he took us back to Abraham and how he was sacrificing Isaac he said where did that RAM come from where did that dog come from God is still a creator he can still create oh come on somebody what was he telling you when you get into a place and you need God to create for you he will do it and that dub was a sign ooh Oh help us Lord that wasn't the end of it he said it was right up in the mountain there and the Holy Spirit told him y'all know what I'm talking about you know the story when he had the little squirrels in his stomach you know that was giving him that eating him up and he had that gastro whatever disease or what it was and the stomach was on and he had had that since he was a child and God told him amen you know you've been seeing six done but when you see the seven thunders Doug was complete and he saw those real sick squirrels amen they was about six inches but the seventh meaning was complete and that seventh little little squirrel with the little beady eyes jumped at him right now watch this here's a prophet who prayed for everybody and yet he was sick himself is that anything different from what Paul said Paul said I pray for people and I had a thorn in my flesh and I consider the Lord three times hmm and that little squirrel tried to jump at him in his mouth again and it missed him and jumped into the cactus bush I've been there I've seen the bush still lives and you say all brothers what are you trying to say I'm saying when he saw that that was God had not told him now he's telling you you would like that dog that story you remember the dog they used to use them pigeons you know to to fly during the Battle of a war that pigeon didn't have don't I'm ammonition he couldn't shoot back but he was taking the bullets hallelujah is that right I'm jumping here I'm trying to get to the thing here that I want to get to but anyway the bigger the pigeon you know he he even one of his arms are broken what was he telling you when you see this wreck when you see this automobile amen in a wreck and I die don't be confused the message made at home hallelujah the message made at home it was a perfect message I'm complete with it it's Saanich hallelujah but I want you to know I made it home hallelujah everything finish Oh hallelujah you and I must understand Amen that God didn't leave nothing undone everything the bride needs to make a rapture is here but you can't get there without the nature can't get there without the nature that's why the Bible said who shall believe I reported to whom the arm of the Lord shall be revealed it must be a revelation to you hallelujah it was a tender plant it wasn't something listen they even got a little thing now they're on the youtube about this lady I forgot Yvette is her name of Evelyn or something trying to explain the ministry of William Branham talked to a great congregation supposedly and and and talking about how he prophesied about our ministry that's going to come and how God is going to anoint that portion of people who believe this ministry those who were rejected those who were not accepted just prior to the rapture God is going to pour out the spirit and he said y'all know that's too true brother bands are there three of us there's Abraham right there's lot come on Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and those harvest the harvest of that will be annoying pity right at the end time do you believe your prophet program said that unknown to will make liam those aliens would be growing back I do this is because you're the seed of it you're the harvest of his preaching just like all robbers and Billy Graham they have a harvest and he said listen even the Prophet God said with that anointing fall and then he says listen which it will God will have a final outpouring and that outpouring he said during that the Gentile door will be shot there him that is pure righteous holy filthy whatever you are boom there you are people ain't looking for nothing but I'm looking for something those Rockets didn't stop they kept going up boom boom that's what I said that was the unveiling of the word and this message is rapturing faith Wow it ain't cutting you down it's trying to bill you up it's trying to bring you to a place where you'll know who you are and stop looking at your flesh no flesh it's car seat oh I'm gonna have to jump but even even in Salomon it was like it was like the love of two doves he goes on and says duh in solemn tones of southern 115 I love this because he said behold Thou Art Fair my love behold Thou Art Fair thou help dog I don't know what those eyes are dog eyes means that you don't look at no one else but you made this is my mate mate he is my lover of my soul and whatever he says is that right one thing about a dog a dog likes to come back home that's why they could use them those pigeons would find their way cuz Peter is the type of dog find their way home to take a message go to God you didn't get it but that's alright a man he finds his way you see them attain something you might have a backslider somewhere they might be taken out somewhere but if there really are dogs if they are elected they will find their way home hallelujah no matter how much they shot at y'all just Oh focus oh y'all go ahead on that's 101 money one of my nieces said they're down down there South Carolina I thought oh my god you better be careful Oh y'all go ahead on with your profit I'll show him I'm going on with my profit hallelujah I don't need a date to nor Cora just give me my profit ooh honey God follow him because he fathered Christ the message wasn't message william branham the message was Christ I thank God for His faithfulness and I can't hardly wait to see it a real born-again Christian is different from I'm almost done it's 839 on my how what time is it on yours just give me a few more minutes but the dog can eat wheat listen now I've always talked about the dog being the symbol of God and the crow being the symbol of the hypocrite a crow can set out on an old dead carcass and eat all day long and fly right out in the field and eat wheat with the duh and that's just what we do mmm we message people we go over here and all I'm going over there ain't nothin I'm you know a then you just eatin off that denominational stuff then you come running back over here something wrong with your experience you cannot eat off to the dog that slop that slop okay how good it is slop good to a pig cuz this nature haven't been changed but when you eat up this word if you're really born again let me tell you if you really got the Holy Ghost you cannot stand it I can't cut my radio on and listen to that stuff oh god that just slop you said brother but be careful no I don't have to be because it's the same word and that day it was powerful hallelujah when God gave them the manner he said whatever you do don't keep it over and what happened they tried to keep that manner over and became maggot filled maggots and that's what happens to it that same manner that used to work in that day it's just maggot feel right now ain't bringing no life cuz death done set in a coca set out on the old dead caucus and eat all day long the fry right out in the field and eat wheat with the dog but the dog can't eat wheat all night the dog but the dub can eat wheat all right but it can't eat the dead carcass he just can't do it he can't stomach it and I wonder why we couldn't do it they're both files fouls but birds but why it's the structure of them that's the way it end with a genuine Christian just a nominal national Christian can just take anything but a genuine born-again Christian cannot take the things other where he's constructed differently hallelujah I found out and that's what it is the dub don't have God we can't eat that mess it will kill you it will spiritually kill you if they're dead how you expect them to give you life you said indeed yes they are the Bible said a woman that lives in prison she's dead already I'm almost done partakers of his divine nature that's the door right there let me tell you something divine love conquers everything and you and I ain't getting there we don't have it hallelujah the only way you can have this here you got the yield and yield and yield right when the seed is dying it shrinks it blows up then BOOM right knowledge and temperance and patient in God in the old yes a godliness brotherly kindness y'all know what I'm saying all that gotta be and you can't get damn being a wolf when I ain't gonna let them talk to me like that you better if you following it up you get a of nature or goat nature on you he's moving you be left right there by yourself oh yes ma'am yes sir and then you be wondering why I feel like I feel you just ran the dove off have you ever had a job on your porch soon as you get there he just catch a glimpse right so you gotta understand they're very sensitive and very sensitive to you now y'all understand me the Bob said make your calling and election sure is that right grace so you got to understand you've got to have that and this is people are you insane what do you believe brother would I believe like brother branham talk when I first got born again now understand my conception started with faith but that was my conception it was not my birth and that faith was given to me now who love cuz faith in love or twins even though you don't see faith down there love had to be there God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that's the gospel when you can see that God loves you faith is then applied or given to you by who God alone not your faith his faith because the Bible said the just shall live by his faith but if you don't take people to Calvary which a lot of people in the message never ever say come to the altar or stand in your seat and ask the Lord Jesus Christ into your heart people don't believe oh I believe the message and you never went to Calvary you never get there you got to go by the way of the blood that's the Old Testament hallelujah have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe then what was you preach what preached what was preached to you hallelujah you gotta go by the depth Berrien resurrection in order to rise ain't never confess the Lord Jesus so many um and that's why they in the conditioning in the devil don't care if you can believe in quote brother branham verbatim if you ain't got no light you still got pride and arrogance and all that stuff mix up in there amen yeah you need to be wrong again I'm cutting in I must stop here but let me tell you something listen when it comes to God what was the book what was the bride book I'm gonna go back to that it was the lamb book of life lambs so in that book was all lambs and in that book was given life to all lambs no goats was in that book that's another page that's another story that's another book that's the book of life when you got the goats and the Lambs hallelujah but in the Lamb's Book of Life only those who come up to the place of being a lamb will make a rapture I didn't say he wasn't saved but I said that's the only one that's gonna make a rapture that God will come up here and listen he said that's the victory in the love divine hmm but what let's say it like this because that was said in French where they put the adjectives or the hat birds before the verb look so let's say like this this is the victory in divine love you know how they do it English wise you know like children said I ate the fish I ate the food all the grandkids say I ate the food all and we said we hate all the food we ate the food we ate the food all I like it when they say it but but we say all of the food so you look at this thing you soar what do you mean it's divine love that gives you the victory His divine love divine love been proven over and over again the bull the bees you know time brother bear took off his shoes to see whether his brother could fit him hmm took off his coat to see whether the coat fit what was it he didn't care well I bought this man its name-brand I don't care it wasn't hunting like that he was sold under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he never thought about himself and as long as you just think about yourself you ain't got a jack cuz love thinks about others that's that's your Bible it's not puffed up it seeketh not her own it's always thinking about somebody else's that's Stan you know we see how God deals with us even though chastisement is not pleasant at the time but if we take blessed iseman tasks as sons and daughters it will yield Jesus Christ in our lives I want to be chasing now some people say well if I don't make it as the vod's version i'ma make it as food version don't you know foolish versions are cast into outer darkness whatever that is it ain't heaven it sounds like the same place that the lost ghosts the foolish virgins goals as well you said what do you mean well let me say like this the Bible said that the white throne judgment that's where Jesus separates the goats and the sheep on the seat from the goal so wherever they were they were mixed they mingled together right there's a lot of people who in jail who are innocent but they in there and my point is there is no way I would even allow that to be considered in my mind or in my soul I don't want or have a desire to miss the rapture I have no desire to be considered foolish virgins all I know is that I have a whole high calling in Christ I'm pressing toward that mark no matter what Oh brothers do you make mistakes I have made tons but thank God for the blood of Jesus I don't have a quit in me I do not have quitting in me and he gave me that I was thinking about that earlier coming football players if you're gonna make a good football player you must learn how to take the pain in any sport if you're gonna be good at it you got to learn how to take the pain cuz you're gonna get some but if you push through the pain it makes you a better sportsman and if you push through Christianity the pain that brings Christian that comes with Christianity it makes you a better Christian it puts some muscles of faith on your hallelujah it does something on the inside I can't even explain what I'm trying to say but God don't use cowards soldiers and he says in that day if you ashamed of me he said I'll be ashamed of you I don't want God to be ashamed of me this ain't no a system like the brother said you know you being it up the mark of the beast just trusting oh I believe the message that's what they that's what happened a lot of them in in Moses day but they wouldn't move right in to what Moses creech t' only two of them Joshua and Caleb how come Joshua and Caleb got a new spirit a different spirit from the restaurant because they were obedient and my point is this a menu and I must come to a place it meant that we must settle within ourselves you're gonna either be saved and make a rapture or you just gonna sit back and be lost or I'm just going well I don't know exactly what I'm gonna be I don't I don't know what his choosing is I'm gonna tell you something if there is such a thing I'm sure gonna make it hard for him to turn me down fine you just lay back and well I'll just die wet case around whatever will be no no no no it hit me I don't push through too many things family jobs you name it friends I've come through too much take my head off whatever you need to do you know y'all see all y'all don't know what I'm going through in this message all these people and he preaches and everything else and you know how I always said to myself I Know Who I am I Know Who I am thought you know I Know Who I am you got to know who you are I don't care who's what Susie and John and all the rest of them doing out there God has never left himself without a witness and if I've got to be the only one which I know I'm not but I believe this church folks y'all got something good going on and you don't even know it but God has visited this church many a times we should never be in a backslidden condition that we're in ever with all of the word that's come cost this pulpit then we run amen from one building to the next building to the next but why you follow it then you know because there's something on the inside of you that makes you know it's right but instead of just taking the time and says God have mercy on me see you can't lie to God you can't fake it till you make it not in this one you've got to be real with God and all you got to do is ask in sincerity and don't try to old Lord hold something behind your back you got to give it all your greatest victories this right here Lord are you Lord out even I don't even know how to you but you can show Oh help me Lord Lord I yield I surrender aw and when you come to a place and you surrender all all of a sudden you see things in your mind that you need to give up and you got to say I give that up long I give that up Lord help me give that up y'all hear what I'm saying that's how you go with God when you see things in your life you can't give up that's when you say lord help me take it out from me it's your will for it to be going Lord I'm submitting to your will not my will but thine be done that's when God comes on the scene but you know all you can get it before him and like I said holler and scream all you won't - he ain't moving - you surrender love the Lord then inspiring a word father we come before you lord it's humbly as we know how we think of Jesus for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your Living Word you're the only true and living God and father we we come before you we make mistakes but we ask for forgiveness every day and a lord we just don't ask for forgiveness so that we can remain in that state it is our desire it's our desire to please you because I know if my life can please you it'd be okay our lives we come here to please you like your dear son Jesus not our will but thine be done thy will be done no matter what the cost no matter what the cost give us grace to forsake all no matter what it is give us grace to sit forsake our Shepherd Lord of our lives we need your guidance and we need your leadership help us now as we commit our lives to you Lord take us afresh Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen the more that the law the more that I release my kiss the more you take control the more that I can myself the more you live yup Oh every day I live Lord I love you more can we sing that again the more that I [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] master [Music] [Music] [Music]
