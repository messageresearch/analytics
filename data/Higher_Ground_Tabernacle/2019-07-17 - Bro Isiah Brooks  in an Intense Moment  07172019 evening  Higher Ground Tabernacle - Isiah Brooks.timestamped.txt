[4:33] I'll go with him with the letter stand
[4:46] will be coming from st. John the Tim
[4:50] chapter beginning at the seventh verse
[4:53] st. John 10
[5:06] beginning at the seventh verse Saint
[5:09] John 10 beginning at the seventh verse
[5:15] then said Jesus unto them again verily
[5:20] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[5:24] the Sheep
[5:24] all that ever came before me are thieves
[5:27] and robbers but the Sheep did not hear
[5:31] them I am the door By Me If any man
[5:36] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[5:40] in and out and find pasture the thief
[5:44] cometh not but to steal and to kill and
[5:48] to destroy I am come that they might
[5:52] have life and that they might have it
[5:56] more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd
[6:00] the Good Shepherd giveth his life for
[6:04] the Sheep one more scripture Matthew 26
[6:10] we began reading at the 36th verse
[6:13] Matthew 26 and we'll begin reading at
[6:18] the 36th verse then cometh Jesus with
[6:23] them unto a place called Gethsemane and
[6:26] saith unto the disciples sit here while
[6:31] I go and pray yonder and he took with
[6:37] him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee
[6:39] and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[6:45] then said he unto them my soul is
[6:48] exceedingly sorrowful even unto death
[6:51] tarry ye here and watch with me now
[6:56] think about it Jesus so and he sorrowful
[7:01] he's heavy
[7:04] the feelings of a man is now surfacing
[7:09] in our Lord's life and
[7:13] went a little further and fell on his
[7:15] face and phrase saying oh my God if it
[7:20] be possible let this cup pass from me
[7:24] nevertheless not as I will but as thou
[7:27] wilt and he cometh unto the disciples
[7:31] and finding them asleep and said unto
[7:34] Peter what could ye not watch with me
[7:39] one hour watch and pray that ye enter
[7:43] not into temptation the spirit indeed is
[7:47] willing but the flesh is weak he went
[7:51] away again the second time and prayed
[7:52] saying O my father if this cup may not
[7:56] pass away from me except I drink it thy
[7:59] will be done and he came and found them
[8:02] asleep again for their eyes were heavy
[8:08] don't you understand
[8:10] in an intense moment the people were
[8:16] sleepy sleepy and he left them and went
[8:21] away and prayed the third time saying
[8:24] the same words then cometh he to his
[8:28] disciples and said unto them sleep on
[8:30] now take your rest
[8:32] behold the hours at hand and the Son of
[8:36] Man is betrayed into the hands of
[8:38] sinners
[8:39] let us pray father we thank you for your
[8:43] amazing grace we thank you for being so
[8:47] good to us
[8:49] you have been better to us than we have
[8:52] been to ourselves and Lord you have laid
[8:56] out the way of the word and you have
[8:59] shown us by your amazing grace what is
[9:01] required of us father give us wisdom we
[9:06] know that our is coming and father I
[9:09] want to be ready lord help us now to be
[9:14] ready and your lovely name Jesus Christ
[9:18] we pray you may be seated I do apologize
[9:21] I thought had had my Bible with me and I
[9:25] didn't bring it but
[9:27] by God's grace we'll work with what we
[9:30] have I don't like coming in the pulpit
[9:32] without my by the way no matter what
[9:34] kind of technology I have but you know I
[9:38] love the Lord and I believe that this
[9:41] message came from God
[9:43] one thing I know for certain you and I
[9:47] must realize and understand by God's
[9:49] grace that every Christian that call
[9:52] themselves Christian it's not and will
[9:55] not be wrapped already we must
[9:59] understand that some Christians will
[10:02] come up at the first resurrection and
[10:06] then some will come up at the second
[10:09] resurrection but those of us who have
[10:13] been ordained to be in the first
[10:15] resurrection I believe have been called
[10:17] according to Matthew 25 brother Craig
[10:21] ministered I believe a little bit on the
[10:23] foolish virgins and the wise virgins and
[10:26] as the time goes on we can truly
[10:28] understand what what makes one foolish
[10:35] it's because we see the time in the
[10:39] season we have heard the call and yet we
[10:44] find ourselves da Latorre
[10:46] we find ourselves moving slowly or
[10:50] moving without excitement failing to see
[10:54] that the call was a matter of life and
[10:57] death we understand by God's grace that
[11:02] there's a certain character and we've
[11:04] been preaching on that the we were
[11:06] talking about the origin of our origin
[11:09] would talk about you know the Empire
[11:10] we've been talking about the Holy Ghost
[11:13] we've been talking about the sealing of
[11:14] the Holy Ghost we've been talking about
[11:16] the characteristics of the Holy Ghost
[11:18] which is God's divine nature and we've
[11:21] been telling everybody and been trying
[11:23] to get invited refocus and see that
[11:26] without the divine nature you do not
[11:30] dwell within the city all right and you
[11:35] and I must understand that there's this
[11:36] the divine nature is not something you
[11:38] can work at it is not something
[11:41] that you can add to yourself it asks to
[11:44] you the Bible tells us by God's grace
[11:49] that we it talks about adding but
[11:53] brother Branham said this thing it is is
[11:55] the seed it adds to you but you must be
[11:59] quickened the seed must be quickened in
[12:02] order for it to add in other words
[12:04] that's the only way you can grow in
[12:06] Christ is that that seed germ of life is
[12:09] quickened within you now we realize a
[12:13] man that we have gone through this
[12:15] message we've gone through a great deal
[12:18] of revivals every little ism has had its
[12:24] revival and what has it produced we
[12:30] don't see no more Jesus than we've seen
[12:32] in a long time but we realize a man that
[12:36] it must come and it must be present now
[12:40] so there is because the Bible tells us
[12:43] that Jesus Christ left never left
[12:45] himself without a witness you and I must
[12:49] understand we cannot afford to look at
[12:52] others or watch others when you win when
[12:57] we must understand that our own lives
[13:01] are on display we are all Amen marching
[13:07] or being presented amen to Christ at
[13:12] this moment we are literally walking and
[13:15] being judged by those that judge you are
[13:19] either in step or you out of step this
[13:23] message is calling us to get back in
[13:26] line when I think about Amen how we have
[13:30] come and I think about the the amount of
[13:35] thank you brother the amount of time
[13:36] that has been wasted and each and every
[13:40] one of us perhaps could say Lord I've
[13:42] wasted a lot of time yet is still the
[13:46] mercies of God has been with us this is
[13:49] what we call an intense moment that's my
[13:54] message intense
[13:55] moment a time Amen that that that where
[14:01] where everything is to its extreme
[14:04] something is occurring and it's just
[14:06] moving so fast that you can hardly keep
[14:09] up with it
[14:11] remember Amen the scripture says the
[14:14] vision will be made plain and let him
[14:16] that read it run because why God will
[14:20] not tarry
[14:21] once the mate once the word has been
[14:24] open and it has been God is not in a
[14:27] tarrying mode
[14:28] it's literally moving faster than we can
[14:32] explain or even see with our own eyes
[14:35] but the coming of the Lord is closer now
[14:38] than it ever been before
[14:40] but the random preached a message called
[14:43] desperation and when you are desperate
[14:46] it means that you you are is to the
[14:49] extreme you you are excessive you know
[14:52] you know that that that you got to do
[14:54] something you know it's it's it's your
[14:57] ultimate AAA
[14:58] there are effort to get whatever you
[15:02] desiring to get we know by God's grace
[15:07] that the world is falling apart
[15:09] I consider myself so blessed not because
[15:14] I've been such a great Christian I'm
[15:16] ashamed of myself I wish I was a better
[15:18] Christian but I do know one thing that I
[15:22] am one and I know that this world is
[15:26] falling apart and and there's nothing
[15:29] can stop it it is the very will of God
[15:31] the Word of God being made manifest now
[15:36] the tension is beginning to get stronger
[15:39] all along it's like a woman having a
[15:42] baby you know when she's in her first a
[15:44] few or whatever they call it trimesters
[15:48] or whatever they call it amen when she's
[15:50] going through that labor and and you
[15:52] know she's not ready yet but we know
[15:54] that as the baby begins to come down the
[15:58] channel and come into that place a
[15:59] position of being borning born we
[16:02] realize that everything gets more
[16:04] difficult everything becomes a strain
[16:07] everything become
[16:09] test where the pain may have been a two
[16:12] or three now it's a seven or eight or
[16:15] whatever they need to push that baby
[16:17] through and you and I must understand
[16:20] that God is going to push you if you
[16:24] can't lead you he will push you and his
[16:27] methods are pushing you is to intensify
[16:31] trials in your life it is to bring you
[16:35] to a place that you look up for help
[16:43] God himself did not even spare himself
[16:50] but think about Jesus Christ who was God
[16:54] manifested in the flesh who chose to go
[16:58] to Calvary and as we said before amen it
[17:03] was an intense moment here was a man and
[17:07] you know just like brother Brandon said
[17:08] God didn't allow Jesus to go to Calvary
[17:11] as God he went to Calvary as a man
[17:14] that's why he said my God my God why has
[17:18] thou forsaken me
[17:20] not the pit by not by the power of the
[17:24] Holy Spirit
[17:25] it was his man person when he's nailed
[17:29] there in God's emanate and it was
[17:31] intense
[17:32] in an hour that he knew was there he had
[17:36] already arrived and he got his disciples
[17:40] and said pray with me just pray with me
[17:44] one hour and the Bible said that the
[17:47] disciples could not even pray with him
[17:50] one hour it's like now and what we don't
[17:56] see is that their work they were not
[17:58] trying to be lazy but the demonic powers
[18:04] we're gathering for a great crucifixion
[18:08] and that demonic power amen was
[18:12] literally putting the followers of
[18:14] Christ to sleep at a time he needed them
[18:19] the most
[18:20] we better thank God for Gethsemane
[18:23] because I'm gonna tell you something
[18:25] guys 70 prayed not for himself but for
[18:28] us as well without that prayer he would
[18:32] not have made it because you see even as
[18:34] a man he had to make a decision in an
[18:38] intense time and he understood his
[18:41] suffering it was the worst of all the
[18:45] sufferings that the Romans had
[18:47] crucifixion crucifixion something that
[18:53] you and I can't even comprehend but God
[18:57] even before the foundation of the world
[18:59] chose that kind of a suffering it was
[19:03] the worst on the planet worse than being
[19:07] beheaded worse than being thrown to
[19:09] lions
[19:11] it was worse than the Endicott it was a
[19:14] slow death a painful death and you
[19:18] better believe it that Jesus's
[19:19] crucifixion was worse than any man ever
[19:23] no man had been beaten like that before
[19:27] no man had to suffer like that before
[19:31] it was an intense moment but he had to
[19:35] decide within that moment am I gonna do
[19:38] the will of the Father
[19:39] or am I gonna surrender brother branham
[19:43] said even when he was on the cross all
[19:47] he had to do was move one thing said the
[19:50] angels were there all in the trees
[19:52] waiting for command from him but the
[19:57] Bible said he said his face like a flint
[20:00] people y'all understand what I'm saying
[20:02] if you've never suffered him you ever
[20:04] heard have had any kind of pain let me
[20:07] tell you something your pain cannot be
[20:10] compared to that suffering no matter how
[20:13] bad your pain was it cannot be compared
[20:16] to the suffering that Jesus Christ
[20:18] suffered Oh Calvary and he chose to do
[20:21] it because he loves you he chose to do
[20:25] it because he realized he'd meant
[20:27] without him that would have never been a
[20:30] resurrection without him heaven that was
[20:33] built for us would not have been ever
[20:37] everything that had been done for us
[20:40] after this layer after this world would
[20:43] have come to naught it would have
[20:46] stopped and Satan would have won you
[20:50] know what he would have won he would
[20:52] have won the fact that we the sons of
[20:56] God never replenished the earth it would
[20:59] have brought God's Word to avoid and
[21:02] then God would have no longer been God
[21:05] he couldn't stop the word there was
[21:09] something on the inside of Jesus
[21:11] regardless looking at all the pain he
[21:14] realized he meant what he had to do oh
[21:17] my god and he went through it in an
[21:20] intense moment in an intense moment in
[21:24] that moment when he knew and then that
[21:26] something was happening and Here Come
[21:28] Judas the man amen that's going to
[21:30] betray him and he comes along and in an
[21:33] intense moment he still had to show
[21:35] Judas how much he loved him and not only
[21:41] did he allow Judas to kiss him but he
[21:43] also told Judas that he loved him you
[21:47] understand me so even in these moments
[21:51] that we feel like we have a right not to
[21:53] love somebody god it requires us to love
[21:56] them that's why I said love your enemies
[22:02] do good to them that despitefully use
[22:04] you pray for them you see he's not
[22:09] asking you something asking you to do
[22:13] something that he himself never did he
[22:16] did it in an intense moment God always
[22:24] put the pressure on you he said ordered
[22:28] ever now God allows it God ordains it
[22:33] because he wants you to see what's in
[22:36] you and what's not in you and when we
[22:40] see what's not in us he wants us to see
[22:43] what needs to be in us in order to make
[22:47] heaven he always
[22:50] and he's good at it from the Old
[22:53] Testament healing to the new God has
[22:56] always put his people in battle
[23:01] why because he's a warrior God loves to
[23:06] war and he was and he fights through us
[23:10] so that we can see how great he is
[23:13] come on somebody but God will not spare
[23:16] you
[23:17] he's not gonna put cushions in your
[23:19] battles he wants you to feel he wants
[23:23] you to understand the pain he wants you
[23:25] to go through all of that but when you
[23:27] go through it
[23:28] guess what's at the end a greater
[23:31] revelation of who you are and who God is
[23:36] right though the true Church of God used
[23:43] to be such a supernatural church got it
[23:48] out of the day of Pentecost all the
[23:52] kinds of miracles and signs and wonders
[23:54] were done and and there has such an
[23:56] abundance of gifts and the Paul had to
[24:00] put them all in order now the church
[24:04] can't you can't hardly find anything but
[24:07] it's not it's not it's not the word
[24:09] that's wrong it's the people that's
[24:11] wrong we failed and we folded under
[24:15] pressure we didn't stand when we should
[24:19] have been standing and it's so bad and
[24:23] then in this day the Bible said the love
[24:26] the love of many shall wax cold that's
[24:29] the area that's the time and you must
[24:31] understand what is this it's intensed
[24:34] you must watch and pray all the time why
[24:38] we're dealing with demons Devils press
[24:45] you they will oppress you they will
[24:46] defeat you
[24:47] if they can't they're whole a job and
[24:52] ambition in this realm is to stop the
[24:55] bride of Jesus Christ to bring her to
[24:59] nought but she can't be brought to
[25:02] nought
[25:03] she's protected by the word and she will
[25:06] rise back to her glory no matter what
[25:11] Satan has tried throughout the ages this
[25:14] ride no matter what you look like you
[25:17] will come out as a conqueror you will
[25:22] defeat the devil sometimes we lose
[25:26] battles but but we won't lose the war
[25:32] the problem God said the whole system of
[25:36] Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[25:38] Presbyterian the whole religious system
[25:41] is falling apart it is why is it they
[25:47] can't take the pressure and right now
[25:50] God is pressurizing his bride is that
[25:54] right if you are an astronaut you must
[25:57] be pressurized God is putting the
[26:00] pressure under you let me tell you
[26:02] something we can always praise God when
[26:05] things are going well but when things
[26:08] are going bad that's when you can tell
[26:10] somebody knows who they serve hallelujah
[26:14] oh it's the truth when things are going
[26:17] bad you need to praise him anyhow it
[26:20] disturbs the devil it shakes him up it
[26:24] confuses him when you praise God when
[26:31] you're going through a real battle oh
[26:34] and God don't always give you what you
[26:37] want and you will never manipulate him
[26:40] you will never by your emotions and by
[26:43] your way of acting and everything else
[26:45] make God do something he doesn't want to
[26:48] do now we as people you may be able to
[26:52] get next to us but not to God God will
[26:55] spank you like the prophet of God said
[26:57] God sometimes feel like kicking us
[26:59] around because of our unbelief in our
[27:02] nonsense
[27:03] but God has a divine purpose and he's
[27:08] more concerned about his divine purpose
[27:10] than he is about your attitude hello
[27:15] the truth oho come on when Jonah went to
[27:19] Nineveh and God didn't do it the way he
[27:21] wanted to he had an attitude God could
[27:25] have wiped him off the face of the earth
[27:27] but you know what God did built him a
[27:29] gorg gorge
[27:31] hid him from the heat of the day right
[27:34] took care of him in spite of why cuz God
[27:39] had a purpose and sometimes we as human
[27:43] we just don't make the right decisions
[27:46] when we are under pressure and God is
[27:50] gonna keep putting the pressure there
[27:52] until you get the answers right mmm
[27:58] the whole religious system is falling
[28:00] apart we know that's the truth our
[28:03] national political world is falling
[28:06] apart the whole thing is at the end
[28:08] hello just help what how many
[28:12] earthquakes and what people you know
[28:15] serum saying right now you ought to be
[28:18] under some kind of pressure and when you
[28:24] find out that all of these things are
[28:25] happening and there is no pressure there
[28:27] is nothing says oh my god
[28:29] the Lord is soon to come and let's get
[28:31] ready something's wrong with your vision
[28:34] spiritually you like the three disciples
[28:38] in the hour that you should be praying
[28:41] you're sleeping hallelujah and you know
[28:47] what Jesus said wake up wake up wake up
[28:50] because he says listen the hour of this
[28:53] darkness is coming and it's coming
[28:56] quickly think about it in one hour the
[29:00] darkness was there this darkness was so
[29:05] heavy it caused Peter to react in a
[29:08] natural and tried to cut a man's head
[29:10] off the same Peter that was right there
[29:14] in Jesus's Bible study when he said thou
[29:17] shalt not kill
[29:21] see this pressure that we're now
[29:24] experiencing it is the demonic darkness
[29:27] amen our team was out of the room
[29:29] you freight these demons of the
[29:31] antediluvian days divas Amen that's all
[29:35] they know what they're doing and you
[29:39] must understand that we're not dealing
[29:41] with any amateurs and I'm gonna tell you
[29:45] something I got to tell you and you know
[29:47] my thing is I don't know how to tell you
[29:50] but I'm gonna tell you like this if you
[29:52] don't have that desire to serve God with
[29:56] all of your heart you need to go
[29:58] somewhere and pray you need to say Lord
[30:01] thou is now that I must die in write to
[30:06] all my dears
[30:07] all my thoughts no matter what it takes
[30:10] I must live because this is a matter of
[30:13] life and death and God has given us a
[30:17] grace by the way of this message to see
[30:19] the season he said it won't come unto
[30:22] you like a feed your children of the
[30:24] light everybody know it men wouldn't
[30:29] want to begin to have birth pain the
[30:31] worst was a further down the road and
[30:35] sometimes you know how it is you can
[30:38] think she could be one or two
[30:39] centimeters you walk down the hall in
[30:42] there 5 10 minutes and she's going to
[30:44] eight you can never judge it and so what
[30:50] I'm saying is we don't know I just know
[30:53] brother Branham in the 6th seal he
[30:56] brings out the fact that there was a
[30:59] great earthquake and even on Good Friday
[31:01] there was a great earthquake right and
[31:05] he ties the resurrection into this great
[31:08] earthquake who's to say and then this
[31:11] coming Good Friday is not it we know
[31:15] we've got greater signs listen that last
[31:18] earthquake why was it 7.1 something
[31:22] people is like not not wake up because
[31:32] if you don't begin to pray and stay in
[31:35] the anointing where Jesus will pray is
[31:37] that right if Jesus Christ had to pray
[31:39] you got the break
[31:41] if he recognized his hour you must
[31:43] recognize his hour and his hour was this
[31:47] the Son of Man will be betrayed is that
[31:50] right he said whatever they did it in
[31:52] the green they will do it in the dry
[31:54] hello and you amen in spirit and in
[31:58] truth you are the son of man which will
[32:02] be betrayed because the World Council of
[32:05] Churches will come together against
[32:07] little flocks like this one what you're
[32:11] going to do in their tense moment when
[32:14] they tell you you got to deny this and
[32:16] you got to do die this and you don't
[32:18] know no no no this is Jesus Christ's
[32:20] name baptism we lit he said I'm saying
[32:23] but we know even in the sixth seal Amen
[32:26] it was those three unclean fogs right
[32:30] that came out of the river Euphrates and
[32:32] those three unclean frogs always look
[32:36] back to where does niacin counseled
[32:40] unclean that swept the world with the
[32:43] Trinity doctrine look at what they're
[32:47] producing look no matter how much word
[32:54] they're getting naked her and naked her
[32:57] all the time
[32:58] unclean hello and then during the time
[33:04] you you your God dropped the walnuts
[33:07] because we wouldn't repent what did he
[33:09] do he brought three beaters for beetles
[33:12] out of the river you I say the river how
[33:14] deliver poo there were demons they were
[33:19] the ones who really inspired the rock
[33:22] and roll now the whole world is polluted
[33:25] and guess what they're doing they're
[33:27] getting naked her and thanking her and
[33:29] taking all their clothes off because
[33:32] rock and roll makes you do that people
[33:35] think is just a beat it's a spirit hello
[33:39] somebody what are you saying this is an
[33:42] intense moment you gotta have it
[33:45] are you you lost yes none of us want to
[33:51] go through the Great Tribulation but how
[33:54] do you know
[33:55] you're not gonna go God said make your
[33:57] call and election shoe you can be sure
[34:01] sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm not
[34:07] saying you're not a Christian but like I
[34:09] said all Christians won't make the
[34:11] rapture this world is falling apart and
[34:16] everybody knows something's gotta happen
[34:19] y'all think America is the only country
[34:21] that's confused it's all over the world
[34:25] all the nations are confused and because
[34:28] this is the hour of confusion all the
[34:33] nations and you must understand not only
[34:38] other nations confused
[34:39] but we find out that even the charges
[34:42] are confused Christians are confused
[34:45] because they're not looking at the hour
[34:48] that you're living in when Malachi 4
[34:51] went off the scene it should have put us
[34:53] in such a intense time because first of
[34:59] all God cannot come back to the
[35:02] brightest maturity he can't make a move
[35:06] until we mature that's the long
[35:10] sufferings God waited in the days of
[35:13] Noah long-suffering of God because we're
[35:17] overdue with the coming of the Lord it's
[35:21] the truth people even something has to
[35:25] happen all the systems are messed up
[35:27] I think it's on that message is uh was
[35:36] it just listened to it Israel in the
[35:40] church part - I believe it is brother
[35:43] Branham tells us that Russia will
[35:45] control America hello and she's moving
[35:51] in it already
[35:52] now mr. hos yeah I'm the prophet and
[35:56] already told us and he goes on this out
[35:59] say that in some places he said those
[36:01] Russians soldiers would come on our soil
[36:04] and ravage our women he says it
[36:11] People of God and here the world is
[36:13] saying it ain't happening
[36:15] Russia had nothing to do with nothing
[36:17] whether they did or not they come in
[36:21] they're coming and the churches is
[36:25] laying straight there the Bride of
[36:28] Christ I mean what's gonna shake up it's
[36:30] the saddest thing but the Prophet God
[36:33] said God has to bring a squeeze we won't
[36:37] move we just won't move we know what we
[36:43] need to do but like I said Peter James
[36:46] and John knew they needed to pray but
[36:48] instead they gave over to slumber and
[36:50] sleep demonic pressure the tense times
[36:55] it's not a time to sleep or slumber you
[36:59] understand what I'm saying
[37:01] we realized by God's grace that God has
[37:04] given us the greatest message ever hid
[37:07] the face and we are the greatest people
[37:10] those of us a men who keep pushing and
[37:13] I'm telling you make mistakes that's all
[37:15] right
[37:16] God don't look at your mistakes but he
[37:17] wants you to keep pushing he wanted to
[37:19] keep moving
[37:21] you won't Christ in you that's the only
[37:26] way we'll be able to face even even
[37:30] Jacob knew he could not face he saw in
[37:32] the condition he was in he understood
[37:36] that he needed something supernatural
[37:39] knowing the word in your mind is not
[37:42] enough you need the supernatural
[37:45] quickening of God that'll make you walk
[37:48] right talk right live right love right
[37:50] whatever you need that change if it
[37:55] needs to rest a long night we need to do
[37:57] it hallelujah the world is falling apart
[38:02] we're watching it we're seeing it we
[38:06] think that we've got some special deal
[38:08] with God God special deal is his word
[38:12] and obedience to his word hallelujah it
[38:17] is one word misplaced Amen caused this
[38:21] chaos in the world howdy
[38:22] you think that you're gonna misplace a
[38:24] word and expect to make a rapture no no
[38:27] no
[38:27] you've got to come to the fool obedience
[38:32] to the word hmm your Brotherhood I can't
[38:38] do it all yes you can the Bible says
[38:41] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[38:43] Christ for the remission of your sins
[38:44] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and
[38:46] that Holy Ghost is your fool paint it
[38:51] huh
[38:52] but how do you know whether you've got
[38:54] the real one or not because the real one
[38:56] will always say amen to his word always
[39:01] oh I feel like shouting look at it the
[39:05] schools are corrupt everything is
[39:07] corrupt they cannot get better even
[39:12] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[39:14] ah the charges can't get better they
[39:17] don't even know what to do because the
[39:19] Holy Ghost they said has power don't
[39:21] have no power they can speak in tongues
[39:23] they can shout they can dance they can
[39:25] do all of that but they can't live it
[39:28] hello but the real Holy Ghost the real
[39:34] Holy Ghost is birth into a person by the
[39:37] word and not by emotions Oh somebody
[39:40] help me I gotta say that again the real
[39:43] Holy Ghost is brought into a person by
[39:46] the word and not by emotions cause you
[39:50] wouldn't have all those emotions is that
[39:52] right brother and said he went over over
[39:54] to the Africa they were speaking in
[39:56] tongues and shouting and dancing all
[39:58] that interpreting and everything and
[40:00] they were worshipping Devils see so
[40:03] those things are not evidence of the
[40:05] Holy Ghost even though the Holy Ghost
[40:07] may do it you and I need a change in our
[40:09] soul that'll make us love those that
[40:12] hate us speak well of those that
[40:15] persecute us we need more Jesus I don't
[40:19] know about you but I don't want to be
[40:21] caught without the goods and God is
[40:29] gonna test you ain't no ifs ands or buts
[40:32] about it testing time will come
[40:35] mmm all the nations know that's why
[40:39] they're trying to all put together
[40:40] there's been one there's be one they're
[40:46] gonna set rules and regulations right
[40:48] you can't even have a church unless you
[40:51] powder this and then if you do have a
[40:54] church and get caught you're gonna be
[40:55] put in prison or persecuted something's
[40:58] going to happen because you're not with
[41:01] with the system don't tell me about the
[41:05] system because you and I know what the
[41:07] system is like the system then got
[41:10] everybody so to everybody think they
[41:11] private you're never private as long as
[41:14] you got a phone or car they know where
[41:17] you live they know your language they
[41:20] record everything you know say you know
[41:31] boy they'll tell us another story about
[41:33] this woman in Jefferson Field how her
[41:35] son little fella a man he you know just
[41:39] had an issue he was like let me read it
[41:42] a lady was taught walking in a 10-cent
[41:45] store and had a little boy in her arm
[41:48] and she was going through the counter
[41:49] and getting hysterically she could she
[41:52] would pick up something and show it to
[41:55] the little boy and he would just sit and
[41:57] stare does that sound for me don't stare
[42:02] at me because but don't that sound for
[42:07] me you go to these churches and you
[42:08] preach as hard as you can
[42:10] they go they stare won't even say Amen
[42:15] you shake everything you drop yourself
[42:17] you do something's wrong see you go to
[42:24] another town and pick up something and
[42:26] shows it to a little boy he was just
[42:27] there and after a while she picked up a
[42:30] little bell and began to jingle it and a
[42:32] little boy just stand and she stands
[42:34] started screaming and threw up her hands
[42:37] and the people in the tensage store was
[42:39] watching her so they went to her to find
[42:42] out what was wrong and she says my
[42:45] little boy said he is only three years
[42:47] old
[42:47] all of it once a
[42:49] a year ago he'd take and just sit and
[42:52] stare in space and I took him to the
[42:55] doctor and said and the doctor
[42:57] prescribed certain treatments and things
[42:59] and said the doctor was the doctor told
[43:01] me today that he thought he was better
[43:03] but said he isn't better i've shook
[43:06] everything before him that ought to
[43:09] attract a little boy of his age tension
[43:12] everything that would attract a little
[43:15] boy's child of his age I've shook it
[43:18] before him and he just sit and stare in
[43:21] space he is no better right that's
[43:26] something like the Pentecostal church
[43:28] God has shook every gift in the Bible
[43:30] before them and they still sit and stare
[43:34] in space just like it was something
[43:36] wrong it's time that we woke up friends
[43:40] for it gets too late remember God don't
[43:45] gunshot shake those gifts unless he is
[43:48] trying to attract your attention and
[43:51] when God bring a preacher and he's
[43:53] thundering the Word of God to you he's
[43:55] trying to get your attention
[43:57] not the preacher God and when he just
[44:02] constantly pouring his heart out and
[44:04] can't get a reaction there's something
[44:07] wrong like Jesus went to his disciple
[44:13] said can you not pray with me one hour
[44:19] this is intense moment you're saying
[44:22] attack time to relax and get be at ease
[44:26] in Zion no wrong wrong wrong spirit
[44:29] wrong anointing wrong wrong wrong right
[44:32] this is not what God wants when Jesus
[44:36] knew it was his time you know before
[44:38] this time Jesus went fishing Jesus went
[44:41] out and rest in the wilderness he did a
[44:43] lot of things but now it's intense the
[44:48] hour is come and he recognized this hour
[44:52] why because he can see everything in the
[44:56] vision gathered together he knew when he
[44:59] told Judas go do what you must do and do
[45:02] it quickly
[45:03] he understood that Judas was coming back
[45:05] with the soldiers he understood that
[45:07] this pressure Amen that's coming on him
[45:10] this thing that this decision he must
[45:11] make must be tall he must be totally
[45:14] sold out to it he couldn't be 99% or 98
[45:18] or 95 he had to be a hundred percent is
[45:22] that right because the Bible said after
[45:25] he prayed he said he prayed and he
[45:27] prayed and he prayed and the Bible said
[45:29] his sweat was like two drops of blood
[45:32] and then after all of that the angel
[45:36] came in straight so you gotta understand
[45:41] he poured all out all out but he gave
[45:45] more back and when he whipped the
[45:48] cavalry he was ready for it you and I
[45:52] must be ready for the squeeze
[45:54] we gotta prepare now and the only way we
[45:57] can prepare is my way of prayer that's
[46:00] the way Jesus prepared but you know what
[46:02] he prepared the thing that got me he
[46:05] didn't want to go through it but he said
[46:07] Lord not my will but thine be done
[46:09] and that's what he did he surrendered
[46:11] his total wheel to God intense we fail
[46:19] to see that God has always vindicated
[46:22] himself you know we look at the doctors
[46:24] symbol Amen with the serpentine
[46:27] serpentine the pole and everything the
[46:29] world looks right at it and don't I
[46:30] understand what it's all about but the
[46:33] serpent on the pole is a type of what
[46:34] Jesus came into the earth to accomplish
[46:37] he was made flesh and ordered to take
[46:40] upon himself the judgment of God for sin
[46:44] the foundation of the altar of sacrifice
[46:46] was solid brass typifying the lamb slain
[46:50] from the foundation of the world
[46:52] judgment had already passed upon him
[46:55] when as yet there was no sinner
[46:58] salvation did y'all hear that judgment
[47:01] was already passed on the lamb when
[47:03] there was no sinner he was slain before
[47:06] the foundation of the world do you
[47:11] understand me before you got here he
[47:13] fixed the problem
[47:16] they helped me here yes and you and I
[47:21] must understand this salvation we should
[47:23] never lose the joy of our salvation I
[47:26] know the devil fights us but come on
[47:28] think about Calvary when it gets so bad
[47:30] think about what he did for us the Bible
[47:32] said the suffering of this world can not
[47:34] even be compared right judgment had
[47:45] already been passed upon him when as yet
[47:47] there was no sinner salvation being
[47:50] entirely of the Lord whoa right it ain't
[47:54] you is him but if you don't accept and
[47:58] receive what he's done you'll miss out
[48:01] on it you can't say I can't do it
[48:03] you can and you're right but when you
[48:06] know you can't where do you go David
[48:08] said I go toward I look to Underhill for
[48:10] which cometh my help my help comes from
[48:12] the Lord
[48:13] who's the make of heaven Eli's no I
[48:16] cannot do it but he can he puts us in
[48:22] that those kind of situations so that we
[48:26] can look to him he knows you can't do it
[48:29] from the beginning he knows your failure
[48:31] to begin with but he put you in those
[48:33] hot situations so that you can run to
[48:36] him and he'll come out like a Superman
[48:38] that's what God wants us to do he wants
[48:42] us to see his glory he wants to
[48:44] vindicate his love his power his
[48:47] strength his ability to deliver his
[48:49] ability to hear he wants us to see those
[48:52] things but the only way he can do it he
[48:54] must put us in those intense time oh I
[48:57] love it
[48:59] brother Craig preached on that on that
[49:01] job and that's so true it was an intense
[49:04] time for Joel and you and I haven't had
[49:06] no idea how long job had to suffer who
[49:10] but everything is falling apart and many
[49:13] of us would have thought God hated us if
[49:18] we had gone through that but job
[49:21] searched itself and he kept his
[49:23] integrity that's one thing I love about
[49:25] sister Johnson y'all don't know sister
[49:26] Johnson my sister Johnson from Lima
[49:30] every time I see her she was praising
[49:32] God but you know she had a little moment
[49:34] and I didn't know it she said to brother
[49:37] Craig one day she said brother Craig do
[49:40] you think God is angry with me and I
[49:45] don't know whether it was before it was
[49:47] after then she had a dream of some sort
[49:49] and God showed her you in the palm of my
[49:54] hand Wow somebody help me right and just
[49:59] prior to her death amen by a witness
[50:03] that witness says sister Johnson said
[50:07] [Music]
[50:09] see she had the loss of eyesight she
[50:13] lost her legs she lost a few of her
[50:15] fingers but she never stopped loving God
[50:19] she was concerned about the way God felt
[50:22] about her is God is that Alright
[50:28] and God had that question come up so
[50:31] that he could answer it mm-hmm that's
[50:36] the God I'm talking about he puts us in
[50:40] those situations I was just listening to
[50:42] the prophet of God he said I was so
[50:44] afraid of death he said not afraid to
[50:46] die he said but I just didn't want to
[50:48] become a little cloud I lost something
[50:50] you know
[50:51] see brother Neverland say hey how you
[50:52] doing brother Neville he says her
[50:54] brother but I couldn't shake his hand he
[50:55] was just a cloud he said that's the part
[50:57] I didn't like he said I didn't want to
[50:59] die because I wanted a resurrection I
[51:00] wanted a body I had no idea what it was
[51:04] gonna be like that was intense moment
[51:07] for him and then all of a sudden he was
[51:09] translated or vision or whatever you
[51:12] want to call it whatever you want to
[51:13] call it I was there he said I saw women
[51:16] and men running to me my precious
[51:18] brother hugging me and everything else
[51:20] he said there was a lady there was 97
[51:22] years old she died but she died a
[51:24] Christian and here she was 20-something
[51:26] years oh he says she was beautiful and
[51:28] never would change the game hallelujah
[51:32] what was it God took that fear by
[51:35] revelation gave him the little thing
[51:37] that he was so concerned about God heard
[51:40] it took him there showed him
[51:43] there will be people they men who would
[51:45] believe your message and there be there
[51:47] to woo somebody said and you know what
[51:50] I'm saying when I say believe it I mean
[51:52] receive it I mean acting upon it hearing
[51:55] and acting upon it
[52:00] hallelujah y'all know that right if you
[52:04] don't have the Holy Ghost the gates
[52:05] won't open for you the gates only open
[52:09] for the Holy Ghost field know hallelujah
[52:14] you love the Lord Oh
[52:17] what is the church is all about the
[52:20] churches are supposed to do what reflect
[52:23] the presence of God while the Sun is
[52:25] gone then when the Sun comes up the moon
[52:29] gone but just before they did you ever
[52:32] notice the moon gets real pale and it
[52:34] goes out and I'll tell you the churches
[52:38] already turned pale its anemic it's got
[52:43] away from the blood you understand me
[52:45] what is the blood the Holy Spirit the
[52:49] life of the blood is a Holy Spirit and
[52:52] that's the problem people have gotten
[52:54] away from the blood that you know
[52:56] everybody won't the culture but don't
[52:58] you understand amen if you're not
[53:01] careful it your starchiness can bring
[53:03] into the mark of the beast

[53:11] starch is not a good thing get me get me
[53:15] people were letting my nature how are
[53:17] you right that's the problem we got the
[53:21] wrong nature if God can take those
[53:25] started use and make them run up the
[53:28] street and jump out of windows I am so
[53:30] sorry the intellectuals of this message
[53:33] have been spoiled it and the only reason
[53:37] why we're not getting the same results
[53:39] that William Branham got is because
[53:41] somewhere something's been mixed but if
[53:46] the word is pill you get the same
[53:48] results we got too many people and then
[53:52] being concerned about their character a
[53:54] demon nature
[53:55] we don't want your nature and God don't
[53:57] want your nature
[53:58] God wants to hold it off it doesn't mean
[54:02] you gotta shout all the time and run up
[54:04] and down the hall all the time but when
[54:06] God comes in here's a job unspeakable
[54:10] you gonna do something I don't care what
[54:13] they say I haven't seen too many people
[54:15] that he didn't have emotions he men

[54:19] screamed they're Hollow it may not even
[54:21] last a long time but you're gonna do
[54:23] something now you came face your
[54:28] salvation about that but if there's a
[54:31] change in your life if your life has
[54:33] been changed you got a right to do what
[54:35] your father I don't care if you do
[54:37] cartwheels you gotta write thinking
[54:45] about heaven you ought to do a few every
[54:46] now and again oh you know you look at
[54:50] this thing and I think what it is the
[54:54] Holy Ghost will relieve you of all the

[56:23] faithful far faithful than me
[56:25] hello far faithful then I have a I don't

[56:46] you're gonna come through this life
[56:47] without a war hallelujah but you gotta
[56:51] realize who you are you don't have to
[56:54] feel like who you are you understand
[56:56] what I'm saying oh I'm so happy today I

[57:18] you need to know that you need to know
[57:21] that your son and daughter of God
[57:22] Alleluia and God's gonna put you to the
[57:25] test but he puts you to the test to see
[57:27] if you trust him then you say oh you can
[57:31] say whatever you want to say about me
[57:33] amen
[57:34] I'm gonna do what God wants me to do I'm
[57:37] gonna keep praying
[57:38] whether you told me not to do it or not
[57:41] matter of fact I'm rolling up my window
[57:43] so you won't have to peek tonight I want
[57:49] you to see me pray right he wasn't
[57:52] afraid let me tell y'all something when
[57:57] Jesus finished Calvary there was no fear
[58:01] in him he did not go to Calvary in fear
[58:07] and no matter how they whipped him never
[58:11] did feel conquer him
[58:13] in that same Conklin he did a fear
[58:17] that's in us if crisis in you perfect
[58:22] love casts out fear we don't have to
[58:27] fear the devil's tactics we know that
[58:29] God is in us and he's on our side
[58:31] Oh God help us Lord I'm not the perfect
[58:35] one he's the perfect one you're not the
[58:39] perfect one he's the perfect one I'm
[58:42] almost done but Daniel was tested he
[58:46] wasn't afraid of the lion he didn't care
[58:50] those things of God in the time of
[58:55] persecution according to history they
[58:57] didn't run from the Lions they ran to
[59:00] the Lions they weren't afraid they knew
[59:03] the next step was glory Paul in an
[59:08] intense moment you think oh my goodness
[59:10] Paul would be falling apart oh I'm gonna
[59:13] die at me rose chopping block
[59:15] no Paul was courageous he had faith all
[59:19] the way to the end and it was an intense
[59:22] moment but Paul wasn't nervous he
[59:27] laughed Oh death where is your sting o
[59:30] grave where is your victory and see
[59:33] that's what we do Oh the doctor say you
[59:35] got this and the doctor say you got that
[59:37] and you go who call on the name of Jesus
[59:46] if you got a call on the name of Jesus
[59:48] like you're mad man if you call on him
[59:51] in desperation it is his love he will
[59:54] answer I've been there before
[59:59] you can't just quietly talk to God dear
[1:00:02] Jesus
[1:00:03] in times of desperation you go crazy you
[1:00:08] just caught you don't care what people
[1:00:09] think
[1:00:10] you don't even care if their next-door
[1:00:11] neighbor hear you praying you need an
[1:00:15] answer and you know God hears you he's
[1:00:19] waiting to hear your cry this is not a
[1:00:23] cry Jesus that's not a cry
[1:00:26] whisper that's a cry different times
[1:00:34] I've had to pray with the pillar Jeeva
[1:00:35] oh yeah somebody else might be sleeping
[1:00:42] but I ain't y'all know what I'm trying
[1:00:44] to say what I'm trying to say when these
[1:00:47] moments come upon you chiraq me shaking
[1:00:49] little brother Brown said that they
[1:00:51] prayed and never got an answer but they
[1:00:56] knew God was able see sometimes we pray
[1:01:00] and got you don't even hear God is
[1:01:02] silent what you gonna do to him do win
[1:01:05] reasons when he's silent anything this
[1:01:10] is the key if you ask anything in my
[1:01:12] name
[1:01:12] believing that you will receive it he
[1:01:15] says is yours
[1:01:18] hello the world is already too glad is
[1:01:22] yours and you want to feel him I gotta
[1:01:26] hear a voice the voice is the word is
[1:01:31] that okay those three he bought three
[1:01:34] Hebrew boys is not I don't care what you
[1:01:37] do
[1:01:37] throws in the fiery furnace and I love
[1:01:41] the way brother Branham said it he said
[1:01:43] God don't always rush he just moved
[1:01:46] slowly now where is God they should have
[1:01:51] known because even though hah no matter
[1:01:53] how hot and how heated up the fire was
[1:01:56] it wasn't they weren't feeling here or
[1:02:01] singeing or anything but then they could
[1:02:04] look to the side and the people that's
[1:02:06] carrying them in sweating and eventually
[1:02:11] the fire consumes them and they're like
[1:02:13] wow this is nice you understand me and
[1:02:17] then they look around yo I'm gonna take
[1:02:20] you somewhere
[1:02:21] I don't know how they says I don't know
[1:02:23] how they stood still and let Jesus talk
[1:02:25] to him because I dove in jumping you
[1:02:27] know who said something would have been
[1:02:29] going on your thing but you see when
[1:02:32] Jesus got in there they had a
[1:02:33] conversation going on brother
[1:02:35] and when the King got this a dead weight
[1:02:38] loss so in three
[1:02:39] how come I see four let me tell you what
[1:02:44] it's always another man in the fire
[1:02:46] whenever you go through something God is
[1:02:49] always in the fire hallelujah the Bible
[1:02:52] said the agent of the Lord isn't kept
[1:02:54] about them that served and loved him
[1:02:56] don't you ever think you by yourself
[1:02:58] you're never alone God said I'll never
[1:03:02] leave you nor will I forsake you O Lord
[1:03:06] you must understand that God loves to
[1:03:08] display his powers and that's what he
[1:03:12] does when he's gone taking you through
[1:03:13] something he's displaying his powers so
[1:03:16] that you can see it and when you burden
[1:03:18] when you don't fail and you don't sin
[1:03:20] and you've done all these wicked things
[1:03:22] and the devil saying you don't done so
[1:03:23] much you can't be changed you can't be
[1:03:25] forgiven he is a liar alright just tell
[1:03:29] the devil I'm not your son so you can't
[1:03:31] talk to me like that right it's the
[1:03:35] devil sauce that's going to hell not the
[1:03:37] sons of God it is okay I'm almost done
[1:03:45] think about it to the end of the message
[1:03:49] here was Peter God and told Peter now
[1:03:52] you going to deny me three times before
[1:03:55] the crow you gonna deny me Peter
[1:03:59] says ain't gonna happen I've been with
[1:04:02] you all these years and I ain't giving
[1:04:03] it up it's not going to happen Jesus I
[1:04:07] rebuke you devil because you see when
[1:04:12] once the word go out you can't say it's
[1:04:13] not going to happen if God said so it's
[1:04:15] going to happen and then you can do
[1:04:19] about it whether you disagree with I
[1:04:21] don't believe the world is coming to
[1:04:23] hear that don't make no sense no
[1:04:25] difference I don't care how many times
[1:04:27] Hollywood bring out films about the end
[1:04:30] of the world it ain't happening like
[1:04:32] that it's going to happen just like the
[1:04:34] Bible saying it ain't no big old comic
[1:04:38] only hit the earth and whatever they say
[1:04:40] I don't know but the point is they're
[1:04:42] always trying to deter people from the
[1:04:44] word that is their making of the devil
[1:04:47] the Bible says this earth is going to
[1:04:51] burn and it's going to burn
[1:04:53] the Bible said there's gonna come a
[1:04:55] cosplay like never before
[1:04:58] the Bible says Amen that during that
[1:05:01] time and then they're gonna be hell
[1:05:03] stolen stones of a hail what a hundred
[1:05:09] pounds apiece forget your car these
[1:05:13] better trust you're not out there you
[1:05:15] help you know what I'm saying
[1:05:17] and instead of repenting you know what
[1:05:19] the people are gonna do get angry with
[1:05:21] God that's just what they're doing now
[1:05:24] well if that was God why he let this
[1:05:26] happen talk to the devil he's the one
[1:05:28] doing it but here was Peter caught him
[1:05:35] at 3:26 saying I'm not gonna now you but
[1:05:41] you got to understand when you are under
[1:05:42] pressure
[1:05:43] I'm Peter fail to be pressurized when
[1:05:48] Jesus told him to pray he didn't frame
[1:05:51] he's left so because of his sleep he's
[1:05:54] now being challenged and because he was
[1:05:58] he's now wasn't ready for that hour you
[1:06:02] gotta be ready for this oh brother don't
[1:06:04] say the squeeze is coming we gonna have
[1:06:06] a squeeze and you must be ready for that
[1:06:09] squeeze and that's the only way is being
[1:06:12] ready is that you're gonna have to have
[1:06:14] a prayer life intimate life with Christ
[1:06:16] you know why because i'ma tell you
[1:06:20] something the devil is smart
[1:06:21] you know what he tell you you might as
[1:06:24] well give me and you lost anyway he'll
[1:06:27] tell you these things oh you see that
[1:06:29] the under the squeeze you might make a
[1:06:31] mistake he says see there you ain't
[1:06:32] ready but if you don't understand the
[1:06:36] mystery of it what are you talking about
[1:06:38] I've been born ready
[1:06:41] even when I was a sinner I was ready
[1:06:43] because my name was written in the land
[1:06:45] with the life and when Christ saved the
[1:06:48] world when he died on Calvary I was
[1:06:50] there and he saved me he saved you but
[1:06:58] the devil is smart he gonna talk he
[1:07:00] gonna test you and try you till you give
[1:07:01] your life but you know what I love the
[1:07:04] Lord because he don't let us cross
[1:07:06] Jordan alone
[1:07:07] oh my god yes you love the Lord I do I
[1:07:17] remember being in California at
[1:07:19] California but uh Arizona and in the
[1:07:22] brothers
[1:07:23] the sister was their brother Isaac
[1:07:25] Noriega and and she was dying and they
[1:07:29] wanted the minister to go pray for the
[1:07:30] Lord told me not to go this happened
[1:07:32] twice to be my life that she was going
[1:07:34] on to be of the Lord and when when they
[1:07:37] went to the hospital somehow God had
[1:07:39] gathered all the children in nobody
[1:07:41] called her one of the other she was
[1:07:43] there laying there and when they all got
[1:07:46] in there she comes out of her coma and
[1:07:50] she says all it was beautiful and she
[1:07:54] began to tell the children trying to
[1:07:56] bless them and help them along because
[1:07:58] some of them have been backslidden and
[1:08:00] all of a sudden she broke out an amazing
[1:08:03] grace lay back down and went on home
[1:08:06] I'll have said when I heard that I say
[1:08:09] see that's what I'm talking about Jesus
[1:08:12] if I gotta die let me die like that you
[1:08:16] know what I'm saying
[1:08:16] so so that not only I I know where I'm
[1:08:20] going but I'm point is that other people
[1:08:22] don't know that my living has not been
[1:08:24] in vain you love the Lord who I love
[1:08:28] stuff like that but when Peter the Bible
[1:08:31] said when Peter saw that he had forsaken
[1:08:35] and denied Jesus Christ to his face the
[1:08:40] Bob said he wept bitterly hello
[1:08:45] did Jesus Christ hate him afterwards did
[1:08:51] he hold a grudge hello why because he
[1:08:55] was ordained to do exactly what he did
[1:09:00] he couldn't have got around and if he
[1:09:02] wanted to and then after the
[1:09:05] resurrection what did Jesus say make
[1:09:07] sure you go get Peter God didn't take
[1:09:11] the keys from him he still had the keys
[1:09:14] and what I'm trying to tell you is yes
[1:09:17] even in our failures God still gonna use
[1:09:20] us to his glory
[1:09:21] but what happened in these intense
[1:09:24] moment and you and I must understand
[1:09:25] they're coming
[1:09:26] I left some things out but you and I
[1:09:30] must know it's coming
[1:09:32] hello right now sometimes people that
[1:09:36] you live with people that you work with
[1:09:38] people that you love
[1:09:39] amen they want to put you in a place
[1:09:41] where you got to decide on what to do
[1:09:43] right or wrong whether you're gonna do
[1:09:45] the thing that's right or whether you're
[1:09:46] gonna do the thing wrong intense moments
[1:09:51] because you got to come out with the
[1:09:53] right answer
[1:09:54] cuz you the one that's being tested you
[1:09:57] the one that's being tried and God is
[1:09:59] watching you scouring your grades you
[1:10:04] know the Lord never give up the word for
[1:10:07] something else the word is always right
[1:10:11] and brother man say before we can go bad
[1:10:14] before we do wrong we must reject the
[1:10:16] truth first
[1:10:20] that's tan
[1:10:32] the Lord is good I just want to
[1:10:39] encourage my friends I don't know
[1:10:40] whether they be looking at me and South
[1:10:42] Africa at some point in time but I just
[1:10:46] want them to keep the faith times are in
[1:10:49] tensed and somebody that's going through
[1:10:51] an operation of some sort you know that
[1:10:57] life is in the hands of God and we could
[1:11:01] always remember that fear is the thing
[1:11:04] that torments us faith is the thing that
[1:11:07] gives us victory
[1:11:09] I just believe when you ask God for
[1:11:11] anything and if you believe it you hold
[1:11:15] that you hold fast to that that right
[1:11:19] yeah you hold fast to it because that's
[1:11:23] that victory it's like like okay home
[1:11:26] Moses
[1:11:27] hold it right and you got to understand
[1:11:31] Joshua Lord stand still
[1:11:34] let the Sun stand still and all we have
[1:11:38] to do some time is just stand still and
[1:11:40] God will do the rest
[1:11:42] it's what we started working and trying
[1:11:44] to work it out somebody call me the
[1:11:45] other day trying to figure out something
[1:11:47] that I said brother I can't I can't this
[1:11:49] can't be done this ain't gonna work by
[1:11:51] figuring it out
[1:11:52] we need God God will do the work you and
[1:11:57] I can't do it we can reason with in our
[1:11:59] minds that everything and come up with a
[1:12:03] solution but who's to say that solution
[1:12:05] is right the right solution is cast your
[1:12:09] cares upon him for he cares for you
[1:12:12] that's the solution Oh Lord
[1:12:17] ah it's good to us me Jean Grae how
[1:12:28] sweet the sound there say all right like
[1:12:39] me
[1:12:42] I was was lost but now I'm found was
[1:12:54] blind but now I just listen to a message
[1:13:06] just evening and brother venom says when
[1:13:08] we ever taught whenever we tried to fix
[1:13:11] a problem by reason we've already gone
[1:13:15] wrong
[1:13:16] faith is what fixes every problem
[1:13:21] reasoning he said that's the thing they
[1:13:23] got even the trouble in the beginning
[1:13:25] trying to reason it out you can't you
[1:13:29] you we don't know why certain things
[1:13:30] happen to this that or the other but you
[1:13:32] got to understand God is in control we
[1:13:36] must remember God is in control
[1:13:39] hallelujah when we been there ten
[1:13:48] thousand years bright shining on the Sun
[1:13:58] we know less days to sing God's praise
[1:14:07] than when we first begun and remember
[1:14:18] God and I'll always tell you things
[1:14:20] sometimes God do things because he
[1:14:22] wanted to him he didn't tell the Prophet
[1:14:26] everything when that woman a man's son
[1:14:28] had died she come running to him and he
[1:14:31] lied you had no idea what was going on
[1:14:33] hello God don't tell us everything and
[1:14:38] you and I must understand he doesn't he
[1:14:41] won't always do what we want him to do
[1:14:43] he does what he wants to do but he looks
[1:14:47] some time to see our response guess what
[1:14:50] there was tension on Elijah God hadn't
[1:14:55] shown
[1:14:56] now what am I supposed to do go find out
[1:15:00] what's going on with this lady
[1:15:02] give him a bra ha giving my kill
