[39:32] to come to the second service
[39:49] let's open our books to the book so to
[39:51] the book of judges
[39:53] georges chapter 16 the verse the 27-28
[40:08] verse
[40:13] you can say amen when we get to it
[40:16] the book of judges
[40:20] chapter 16 the 27-28 verse
[40:24] we'll try not to belong this afternoon
[40:27] many people will be tired we don't want
[40:30] to have a lot of sleeping saints after
[40:32] service amen
[40:38] the 27th chapter reads now the house was
[40:40] full of men and women
[40:42] and all the lords of the philistines
[40:44] were there and they were upon the roof
[40:46] about 3 000
[40:48] men and women that beheld while samson
[40:51] made sport and samson called unto the
[40:54] lord and said
[40:55] oh lord god remember me i pray thee
[40:58] and strengthen me i pray thee only their
[41:01] swans
[41:02] oh god that i may be at once avenged of
[41:05] the philistines
[41:06] for my two eyes may the lord add
[41:08] blessings to the reading of his word we
[41:09] might
[41:10] be seated
[41:13] let us just pray the heavenly father we
[41:15] approach a throne of grace one more time
[41:17] this afternoon oh god
[41:19] knowing that in the cool of the evening
[41:20] lord that's when you used to meet up
[41:21] with adam oh god and you had communion
[41:23] with him
[41:24] lord here this afternoon we are here for
[41:26] the same reason to communion with you
[41:28] lord
[41:28] but you speak to us lord our ears are
[41:31] open so that you could speak to us
[41:34] and we want to listen to your father our
[41:36] hearts are open lord to receive a word
[41:38] from you lord
[41:39] may you speak through the speaker lord
[41:41] may you hear through the hearer lord
[41:43] at the end of it oh lord we'll be
[41:44] careful to give you thanks and praises
[41:46] now that we have read your word oh god i
[41:48] just pray oh god that you give
[41:49] ancient lord to the scriptures but you
[41:51] quicken them lord because we know that
[41:53] that the let alone killeth oh father but
[41:55] we know it's your spirit oh father that
[41:57] quicken it and give it life oh god
[41:59] be with us this afternoon in jesus
[42:01] christ's name i pray believing
[42:02] amen just for a short moment i want to
[42:06] speak on the subject
[42:08] a way back
[42:11] the verse the scripture that we read it
[42:14] was
[42:15] of um samson we all know samson
[42:19] when he was born an angel came and told
[42:22] the
[42:23] his parents that we're gonna give you
[42:25] that you're going to give birth to a son
[42:28] and he's going to be the one to deliver
[42:30] israel out of the hands of the
[42:32] philistines
[42:33] and back in those days judges god
[42:36] brought judges one after the other
[42:38] and now it was samson's stern to
[42:41] bring victory to the house of israel
[42:44] but the verse that we read we understand
[42:47] that samson after a very long time
[42:50] after he had he was killing the
[42:52] philistines
[42:53] he forgot the purpose that he was
[42:55] brought onto this earth for
[42:57] and he fell victim to the cause that he
[43:00] was supposed
[43:00] that he was born and the prophet of god
[43:04] tells us that samson
[43:05] represents a church that has lost his
[43:07] hold on god
[43:09] and what he did he sold his birthright
[43:13] to a woman to a woman delilah
[43:17] that's what he did and he went out to
[43:20] flirt with the world
[43:21] now samson represents us he represents
[43:24] israel
[43:25] and we are spiritual israel amen
[43:28] and the prophet of god tells us that
[43:31] satan does not have access to you
[43:33] but you are the one who has to go out to
[43:36] go to him
[43:38] and this is what samson did he left the
[43:41] he left the land of israel and he went
[43:44] to the enemy
[43:45] he went to play with the enemy that's
[43:47] what got him in trouble
[43:49] and we find many times that's what we do
[43:52] we know
[43:53] are all human paul said i die daily
[43:56] we fall we get up and we get going
[44:00] but in iniquity you know what you were
[44:02] doing
[44:03] this is what samson did and he went out
[44:06] and that's how he got himself into
[44:08] trouble
[44:09] but we and us we are not supposed to do
[44:11] that we are supposed to stay in the
[44:13] heritage that god gave us
[44:15] the cause that we were born on this
[44:16] earth for amen
[44:18] we are the bride of christ we know we
[44:21] are born
[44:22] for a purpose to be in this last days
[44:25] we are the ones who are supposed to be
[44:26] reflecting the life of christ
[44:28] to the world because christ said for a
[44:31] little while he will
[44:32] the world will not see me where will he
[44:34] be he will be in you and me
[44:36] that's where the world is going to see
[44:38] christ because
[44:39] we are reflecting him we are mrs jesus
[44:42] christ
[44:43] hallelujah so that's what we ought to do
[44:46] now
[44:47] samson he was falling victim to the very
[44:49] reason he was born
[44:51] and he was a slave to that very cause
[44:54] we know there's a certain woman daughter
[44:59] dinah we read of her in the book of
[45:00] genesis 34
[45:03] it says um indiana the daughter of lear
[45:06] which she bear unto jacob went out to
[45:09] see the daughters of the land
[45:11] and when she came the son of hemer the
[45:13] hevite prince of the country saw her
[45:16] he took her and lay with her and defiled
[45:18] her if she had
[45:19] lea jacob's daughter if she had remained
[45:22] in the land of her heritage where she
[45:25] was to stay
[45:26] she wasn't going to get into trouble but
[45:28] it's because she left the land of
[45:30] protection
[45:31] she left god's protection and she went
[45:33] out to flirt with the enemy
[45:35] that's what god that's what got her and
[45:38] many times
[45:39] we fall prey to that we get so relaxed
[45:42] after sunday during the week you go
[45:46] out there you forget who you are and
[45:48] then you start flirting with the with
[45:50] the devil
[45:50] and you start flirting with the world
[45:53] then you realize oh where am i what have
[45:55] i done
[45:56] it's because you've left the land of
[45:58] your heritage you have
[45:59] left what what the of the land of
[46:02] protection where god plays you
[46:04] so we are not supposed to be like that
[46:07] and now
[46:08] samsung when he was born he was given a
[46:10] covenant he was supposed not to
[46:12] to shave off his seven locks that's
[46:15] where the power laid
[46:17] and that's what he was supposed to bring
[46:20] victory with
[46:21] and throughout his life we have many
[46:24] testimonies brother samson
[46:26] he had many testimonies of how god had
[46:28] brought victory through him
[46:30] one time he was in gaza and they locked
[46:33] him up
[46:34] and they put heavy iron gates and they
[46:37] wanted to attack him
[46:39] but the prophet of god tells us that
[46:41] samsung he was a very little man
[46:44] and surprisingly this little man he got
[46:47] up
[46:47] he uprooted all those uh steel gates
[46:50] and went out and ran away and he killed
[46:53] those philistines
[46:54] it was because he had surrendered
[46:56] himself to god
[46:58] so all these testimonies that was how
[47:01] god was working with samson
[47:03] but in the scripture that we read he had
[47:06] given here he had given up
[47:08] he had given in to delilah and he had
[47:10] sold himself to the devil
[47:13] and now he was in he was now in this
[47:15] place and he was crying he said lord
[47:18] i pray thee only this once or god that i
[47:21] may be avenged
[47:22] of the philistines for my two eyes and
[47:25] the prophet of god tells us that these
[47:27] two eyes they're not physical eyes
[47:29] they're spiritual eyes so that's what
[47:31] the devil is going to try to do to you
[47:32] and me
[47:33] he is going to try and pluck out our
[47:35] spiritual eyes
[47:36] and bring canality in us we are not
[47:39] going to be able to see the word
[47:41] we are so busy we are not reading our
[47:43] bibles
[47:44] we are not listening to the tape your
[47:46] spiritual vision gets blurry
[47:49] amen the prophet of god said whatever
[47:52] you feed most that's what grows
[47:54] if you feed the natural man he's gonna
[47:56] get bigger than the spiritual man
[47:58] and he's always dwarfing him but when if
[48:00] you feed the spiritual man more
[48:02] he will get bigger and he'll be able to
[48:05] subdue the natural man
[48:07] so that's that's that's what we are
[48:09] supposed to do make sure we have our
[48:11] spiritual eyes
[48:12] and that's what the devil does when he's
[48:15] attacking you has to make sure your eyes
[48:16] are out
[48:17] so you cannot see what god is telling
[48:19] you
[48:20] amen so he was standing there
[48:23] reminiscing
[48:24] as he was standing there he hears all
[48:27] these philistines
[48:28] they're making a lot of noise and he is
[48:30] reminiscing
[48:31] all the victories that god had brought
[48:33] him through
[48:34] because they had shaved off his locks
[48:36] where his power laid
[48:38] and his secret was gone but then he
[48:41] remembered one time
[48:43] when he was locked and he had a thousand
[48:46] philistine soldiers around him
[48:48] and remember samson was not trained he
[48:50] was not military trained
[48:52] but because he had surrendered himself
[48:54] to god and he had allowed god to have
[48:57] full preeminence in his life
[48:59] and he gave everything his body he had
[49:01] given it to god
[49:03] when the philistines came to attack him
[49:05] he just took the thing that was closest
[49:07] to him
[49:08] a dry job on the prophet of god
[49:10] describes it and say it was so dry
[49:12] that if you just hit it on a rock it was
[49:14] going to come apart
[49:15] it was just going to crush into powder
[49:17] but because it was in a it was in the
[49:19] hands of a man
[49:20] who had surrendered himself to god he
[49:23] slew a thousand
[49:24] trained military man so whatever it is
[49:28] it don't matter how little you might
[49:30] think just surrender yourself to god
[49:32] god will have a lot of victories through
[49:34] you many times the devil
[49:36] tries to tell you that you are nothing
[49:38] he tries to belittle you
[49:40] but because if you just surrender
[49:43] yourself to god
[49:45] pray and say lord have preeminence in me
[49:47] oh god he is able to have a lot of
[49:49] victories through you
[49:50] and now he was remembering all this all
[49:53] these testimonies he had
[49:55] he was remembering the victories he had
[49:57] won but now it was gone because he had
[49:59] sold out
[50:00] he had sold out his birthright to the
[50:02] philistines he had sold out his
[50:04] birthright to delilah
[50:06] and now he was praying lord just once
[50:09] more
[50:09] may you please give me this strength so
[50:12] that i might be able to avenge the
[50:14] philistines
[50:15] and there he was now the prophet of god
[50:18] tells us that
[50:19] samson is the top of the church and now
[50:21] the church has done the same thing
[50:23] we have denominationalized organized
[50:26] the moment we organize the church loses
[50:29] the power
[50:31] the moment the church rejects the
[50:33] leadership of the holy ghost
[50:35] and takes heed to the leadership of the
[50:38] men then it's done
[50:39] god does not dwell in such a place we
[50:42] try to confine god in a system
[50:46] god does not god does not do that god is
[50:49] a spirit and we are supposed to leave
[50:51] god
[50:51] to have liberty in although just once
[50:55] more the prophet of god said
[50:56] i challenge any persons to show me any
[50:58] place in history
[51:00] since the church first organized which
[51:02] was the roman catholic church
[51:04] at nicaea rome when the catholic church
[51:07] was organized and
[51:08] made an organization and has any church
[51:11] from martin luther this side
[51:13] when god gave martin luther the
[51:15] revelation of justification
[51:17] and as soon as luther was gone they made
[51:19] an organization out of it
[51:21] they were worse than what they came from
[51:24] and it fell
[51:25] along came worsely after him and asbury
[51:28] and so forth
[51:29] they made an organization out of it and
[51:31] it fell along came
[51:33] alexander campbell and it fell with the
[51:35] organization
[51:37] along came john smith now he's talking
[51:39] about the pentecostals just before his
[51:41] time
[51:42] and it fell and every time that man has
[51:45] tried to organize something of a
[51:47] man-made system
[51:48] it fell and never did rise again this is
[51:51] not no history no way where any church
[51:54] that have
[51:55] ever organized but what did fall and
[51:58] everyone fell
[51:59] and never rose again the children of
[52:01] israel in tap was to follow the pillar
[52:03] of fire
[52:04] and every night they must be ready not
[52:06] to organize the sea down there but to
[52:08] move with the fire
[52:09] the moment you put god out of the
[52:11] equation then a system starts forming
[52:14] when moses went up to get the
[52:16] commandments from god
[52:17] the children of israel already had a
[52:19] system they were already building the
[52:21] golden calf and had us
[52:23] and they were now yielding themselves to
[52:25] the leadership of a man
[52:27] dayton and cora leading them into pagan
[52:29] worship that's what happens the moment
[52:31] you leave god out of the equation
[52:33] the prophet of god was coming down and
[52:35] i'm gonna bring it further
[52:37] now that the prophet of god is gone now
[52:40] we are starting
[52:41] the message people we are now starting
[52:44] to organize
[52:45] and we are going to the leadership of
[52:47] man and delivering the holy spirit
[52:50] just like the what the pentecostals did
[52:53] but that's not what
[52:54] what's going to happen the omega bride
[52:57] just like the alpha bride
[52:58] is not going to get organized some might
[53:00] try to
[53:01] but we will not there will be a people
[53:05] that will still stand and refuse
[53:07] organization
[53:08] and stand because there is a people who
[53:11] shall be called bride
[53:13] we are called bride and we will not be
[53:15] organized
[53:16] amen we'll keep on yielding ourselves to
[53:18] the spirit to the leadership of the
[53:20] spirit
[53:21] and one place the prophet of god said i
[53:23] did not come to build an organization
[53:26] but i came to build a powerhouse
[53:28] individual powerhouses
[53:30] i'm looking at powerhouses right now we
[53:33] don't yield to no
[53:35] man-made creeds no man-made doctrines
[53:37] that are not even based on scriptures
[53:40] but we are powerhouses because god when
[53:43] god is going to come for his bride
[53:45] he's going to look for something that is
[53:47] similar to him a powerhouse
[53:49] we know jesus christ is the greatest
[53:51] powerhouse there is
[53:52] no devil can stand before him that's why
[53:55] he allowed
[53:56] you and me to be powerhouses when he is
[53:58] going to come he's going to
[54:00] come and find something that looks like
[54:02] him because i like a truck alike
[54:04] the prophet of god gives an example of a
[54:06] magnet he went to this factory
[54:08] and this magnet was going on top it was
[54:10] picking up
[54:11] every metal that was lying on the ground
[54:14] and he thought he said oh
[54:16] that's just the way jesus is going to do
[54:18] when he is going to come he's going to
[54:20] look for
[54:21] everything that looks like him when it
[54:23] is when
[54:24] he's going to come to take his bride
[54:26] he's not going to look for anything else
[54:28] he's going to look for the holy ghost
[54:29] that he gave to you and me
[54:32] like the pastor was preaching early on
[54:34] the holy ghost
[54:35] we are not just supposed to end there
[54:37] but it is to make way for the very
[54:39] person of christ
[54:40] to step within us amen that's what
[54:43] christ
[54:43] is going to come and look for the other
[54:46] time when we were talking about the
[54:47] grace covenant
[54:48] we're talking about how abraham god made
[54:51] a
[54:52] covenant with abraham uh
[54:55] uh how he when when he his grace
[54:58] covenant with abraham
[54:59] it was of his son christ when he was
[55:02] going to crucify him on the earth
[55:04] and what he did when he crucified him
[55:06] god took the body and he sat on the
[55:08] right hand side of god
[55:10] and he took his spirit away so it was
[55:13] jesus christ the body he took it apart
[55:16] he took the body
[55:17] and he sent down the spirit to you and
[55:19] me so when he is going to come to look
[55:22] for his bride
[55:23] he's going to find for that missing part
[55:25] that part only that's supposed to
[55:27] dovetail
[55:28] with what was there in the beginning so
[55:30] the omega bride
[55:32] that's what we are supposed to hold on
[55:33] to to make sure nothing changes
[55:36] that very holy ghost that fell on the
[55:38] day of pentecost
[55:40] that's the very same one god is going to
[55:41] come and look for amen
[55:44] so the children of israel organized the
[55:46] moment he went to go get those ten
[55:48] commandments
[55:49] but god doesn't live in a place where
[55:51] he's formulated
[55:52] to live in a golden calf and they say
[55:54] that is our god god does not stay there
[55:57] that's why he was angry and he had to
[55:59] bring he brought judgment so
[56:02] as it was in the first exodus is going
[56:04] to be the same in the third exodus
[56:07] if we do the same thing then are we that
[56:10] special that is not going to bring
[56:11] judgment to us
[56:12] no sir the moment we start putting god
[56:15] out
[56:16] we are inviting judgment to us but we
[56:19] realize
[56:20] that instead of the children of israel
[56:22] just taking 10 days
[56:24] to cross from egypt to their promised
[56:26] land they took 40 years
[56:28] what was god doing he was beating out
[56:32] all those systems out all those
[56:35] generations those two million people
[56:37] who were carrying the egyptian systems
[56:39] out he was beating
[56:40] that he was beating that um those
[56:43] systems out
[56:44] so he could have a pure people and
[56:47] instead of 10 day instead of 10 days
[56:48] they took 40 years
[56:50] but you look in these 40 years i believe
[56:54] god had had a plan a separate plan as
[56:58] it was going on remember when i believe
[57:00] when they got out
[57:02] rahab was not yet born so if the
[57:05] children of israel were going to take
[57:06] 10 days to move from egypt to canaan
[57:09] rehab was not going to be there
[57:11] and rahab was a special peace that had
[57:14] to be grafted
[57:15] in to bring christ because christ's
[57:17] lineage
[57:18] was linked to rahab and the prophet of
[57:21] god tells us that
[57:23] in his days he was saying the rapture is
[57:25] nigh any time it can happen
[57:27] and if it happens god it will be still
[57:29] in god's time
[57:30] but look we are now here why did god
[57:33] delay
[57:34] he is giving us an extra time he was
[57:37] given an extra time for you and me
[57:39] the rapture could have could have
[57:40] happened back then
[57:42] but 95 percent of the people in here
[57:44] were not yet born
[57:46] back then what was god doing he was
[57:48] making sure he was giving you and i time
[57:51] to be grafted in so that we could
[57:54] realize
[57:54] our full potential to realize who we are
[57:57] so
[57:58] we could he could get us in so we are
[58:00] not supposed to
[58:01] waste this time that god has given us
[58:03] for an extra time
[58:04] we gotta be awoke and brace up ourselves
[58:08] and fight because we realize god given
[58:11] us an extra time amen
[58:13] just like he did for rahab he is doing
[58:16] the same for you and me
[58:17] giving us enough time to realize because
[58:20] if it had happened back then you and i
[58:21] would have been out of the plan
[58:23] but god is graceful he is merciful to
[58:26] you and me amen
[58:28] so going back to samson he was standing
[58:31] there
[58:32] he had no power muscles still there just
[58:35] as he was
[58:36] before it was just a form of godliness
[58:38] but with no power thereof
[58:40] that's what we have done people now in
[58:42] the message we focus on
[58:44] big churches how big is your church
[58:46] that's what matters now
[58:48] what matters is not the word it's not
[58:50] what's being preached but we are now
[58:52] looking at these mega churches
[58:53] and everything that's what we are
[58:55] focusing big revivals but there is no
[58:58] power
[58:59] that's what we are doing and it has
[59:01] become a ritual
[59:02] and we become so realized because we are
[59:05] in the message
[59:06] that doesn't mean a thing because the
[59:08] the devil knows that there is a message
[59:10] the demons know that there is a message
[59:12] just the same as you are saying
[59:14] the same as these people are saying that
[59:16] don't save you but
[59:18] we're gonna come in to realize we need
[59:20] the power of god back in the church
[59:22] we need the power of god working in our
[59:25] midst
[59:26] to show that we are a church of the
[59:27] living god amen
[59:30] it has just become a ritual people just
[59:32] coming to church
[59:33] sit and go back home for what
[59:36] people don't people now no little know
[59:39] their real reason to come here on earth
[59:41] but the people have to realize that they
[59:44] have to get back
[59:45] to the beginning what god had for us to
[59:47] get that holy ghost
[59:49] to be a people representing christ we
[59:52] are christ ambassadors amen
[59:54] and in doing this we can say samson lost
[59:58] the title deed that he was given to him
[1:00:01] and the title did the prophet of god
[1:00:04] calls it an abstract title deed
[1:00:07] which adam had and at the fall when adam
[1:00:10] fell
[1:00:11] he lost the title deed and the devil
[1:00:14] wanted to get a hold of it
[1:00:15] but before he could get a hold of it god
[1:00:18] took it back
[1:00:19] that was the original honor and what was
[1:00:21] written in this title deed
[1:00:23] dominion over all the earth adam
[1:00:27] when he was naming all the animals and
[1:00:29] the power he had all the nature and
[1:00:30] everything
[1:00:31] it was lost but satan before he could
[1:00:34] get a hold of
[1:00:34] it god took it back to himself and now
[1:00:38] jesus christ we know he is our second
[1:00:41] adam he made a way back
[1:00:43] for us to get back that title deed when
[1:00:46] he was crucified on the cross of calvary
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] those three days before he rose up he
[1:00:51] went to hell
[1:00:52] kicked the devil and took back the title
[1:00:54] deed now it is now
[1:00:56] available for you and me i will read the
[1:00:58] uh
[1:00:59] god's provided place of worship it says
[1:01:02] and
[1:01:02] when you become a christian and accept
[1:01:04] christ as your savior
[1:01:05] then god sends down the abstract it
[1:01:08] shows that no matter what your father
[1:01:10] did no matter what your mother did
[1:01:12] what anybody else did your mother daddy
[1:01:14] might have been a drunkard
[1:01:15] prostitutes whatever it was every sin is
[1:01:18] tricking off
[1:01:19] that gives an answer to a lot of people
[1:01:21] who say who think that what
[1:01:22] well what their ancestors did has an
[1:01:26] effect on them
[1:01:27] that has no effect if you come to get
[1:01:30] this abstract title deed amen
[1:01:32] you've got an abstract title there's
[1:01:34] nothing can put you off of it
[1:01:36] and look everything that's on the ground
[1:01:38] belongs to you
[1:01:39] and when you are in jesus christ by the
[1:01:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:44] every gift of god belongs in the church
[1:01:47] it's an abstract title deed
[1:01:48] it's yours it belongs to you it quickens
[1:01:51] your mortal bodies
[1:01:52] oh my if we'll think of it so this was
[1:01:55] where samson
[1:01:56] was he lost that deed he no longer had
[1:01:59] the power
[1:02:00] he tried to stand there remember the
[1:02:02] victories
[1:02:03] but he could no longer have it why
[1:02:05] because he had lost
[1:02:06] his birthright he had lost the power
[1:02:08] that god had invested in him
[1:02:10] and there he was just regretting
[1:02:14] he was saying lord just once more
[1:02:16] because the power was gone
[1:02:18] but now that's the condition of the
[1:02:21] church
[1:02:22] some people they don't even realize that
[1:02:24] but if we can only come to a place
[1:02:27] of realization that we have to
[1:02:30] cry and say lord just once more where we
[1:02:33] was
[1:02:34] where we was before when god gave us the
[1:02:36] holy ghost
[1:02:37] fighting these battles if we would just
[1:02:40] go back to that
[1:02:41] i remember david of old when he was
[1:02:43] crying lord created me a clean heart
[1:02:46] after he had done wrong trying to get
[1:02:49] back
[1:02:49] he was he remembered what how it felt
[1:02:53] having god with him
[1:02:54] and he felt so vulnerable not having god
[1:02:57] and he was crying lord please restore
[1:03:00] unto me the joy of your salvation
[1:03:03] this is the place where samson was he
[1:03:06] remembered the joy he had when he was
[1:03:08] overcoming the philistines
[1:03:10] now that was gone they were making fun
[1:03:12] of a man of god
[1:03:13] whom who who used to whom when the when
[1:03:16] the philistines heard his name they
[1:03:18] would run away
[1:03:19] but they were now rallied against him
[1:03:21] around him laughing at him
[1:03:23] they were blaspheming god this is what
[1:03:25] we do
[1:03:27] we are christ representatives we are
[1:03:29] supposed to be representing christ
[1:03:31] when we start doing wrong we are putting
[1:03:34] a
[1:03:35] bad reflection on jesus christ because
[1:03:37] we are we are his bride
[1:03:39] so we got to make sure wherever we are
[1:03:42] we know we are representing god
[1:03:44] however we talk we are reflecting jesus
[1:03:48] wherever we go to we are reflecting
[1:03:50] jesus
[1:03:52] however way we handle our matters we are
[1:03:54] reflecting jesus
[1:03:56] so we got to make sure that we are
[1:03:58] having a proper representation of christ
[1:04:02] because we might bring blaspheme to the
[1:04:04] name of god
[1:04:05] because we are the people that god
[1:04:07] decided to place his name in
[1:04:09] amen and he was he was seated there
[1:04:13] regretting crying lord please just
[1:04:16] once more avenge me of my two eyes
[1:04:19] he wanted those spiritual eyes back
[1:04:21] because he knew that without it he
[1:04:23] cannot make it
[1:04:24] he doesn't have that connection with god
[1:04:27] but when you have that proper connection
[1:04:29] with god
[1:04:30] know that there is nothing that is
[1:04:31] impossible and he cried he said lord
[1:04:34] let me die we got to come to that place
[1:04:37] where we want to die to ourselves
[1:04:39] not physically die but die to all of us
[1:04:42] to all of our sins
[1:04:44] because that's the only way we come back
[1:04:45] to god
[1:04:47] we got to come to a place of repentance
[1:04:49] that's what a righteous man
[1:04:51] is the prophet of god he gives a
[1:04:53] definition of a righteous man
[1:04:55] a righteous man is a man whom when he
[1:04:57] falls he gets back
[1:04:59] up it doesn't mean that if you are
[1:05:01] righteous you don't sin
[1:05:02] but the moment you fall down you get
[1:05:04] back up and keep on going
[1:05:06] and we have a promise that says in the
[1:05:08] bible many other afflictions of the
[1:05:10] righteous
[1:05:11] but it doesn't end there it says many
[1:05:13] other afflictions of the righteous
[1:05:15] but god delivers out of them all
[1:05:18] and now this was where samson was he was
[1:05:21] at a place of repentance
[1:05:23] remembering and he wanted the power of
[1:05:25] god back with him
[1:05:27] and he was crying lord let me die let me
[1:05:30] avenge of my two
[1:05:32] eyes and he remembered the cause that he
[1:05:34] was brought here on earth he was
[1:05:36] supposed to bring
[1:05:37] victory to the to the jews back to the
[1:05:39] israelites
[1:05:40] and there he was vulnerable and he knew
[1:05:43] he had to do this
[1:05:44] one last time and then he was he was
[1:05:48] crying
[1:05:48] lord one more time i'm willing to pay
[1:05:52] the price
[1:05:53] that's well that's where we're gonna
[1:05:54] come to you we're gonna come to a point
[1:05:56] when we are repenting
[1:05:58] repenting is not just a matter of saying
[1:06:00] i did this i did that
[1:06:02] it is a matter of turning around going
[1:06:05] back
[1:06:06] totally changing the course of direction
[1:06:08] that is what repentance is all about
[1:06:11] saying lord i'm tired i'm done
[1:06:14] please come and help me that's all he
[1:06:16] had to say was lord
[1:06:18] please save me that's all he had to do
[1:06:21] and he cried
[1:06:22] lord let me die i'm willing to pay the
[1:06:25] price
[1:06:26] and then he said lord is there a
[1:06:28] possibility the philistines were over
[1:06:30] there just looking at him
[1:06:32] laughing they didn't know what was going
[1:06:34] on but samsung was having a revival
[1:06:37] where he was there
[1:06:38] and then he started feeling the locks
[1:06:41] touching his shoulders
[1:06:42] and he started flexing his muscles and
[1:06:44] he felt the power
[1:06:46] of god coming back to him oh if we could
[1:06:48] realize
[1:06:50] that that's what we have to do to if we
[1:06:52] come to a place of repentance
[1:06:54] to have god back in our lives there is
[1:06:57] nothing that can stop him
[1:06:59] from coming back because god is so
[1:07:01] willing to fill you
[1:07:03] more than you want to be filled you
[1:07:05] gotta get right back
[1:07:06] the title deed the abstract title deed
[1:07:09] has to be given back
[1:07:10] into you your hands and my hands the
[1:07:12] prophet god says when the abstract has
[1:07:14] come
[1:07:15] it struck off omitted everything
[1:07:18] amish abstract hold it then as sure as
[1:07:21] the spirit that raised christ from the
[1:07:23] dead
[1:07:24] i have an abstract deed that i'm a part
[1:07:26] of that body
[1:07:28] with the abstract of the holy ghost
[1:07:30] making that body of word leave
[1:07:31] out just exactly like he did it him
[1:07:34] as he promised in the last day the
[1:07:36] abstract my sins are struck out
[1:07:39] all your sins are struck out by the
[1:07:41] blood of jesus christ
[1:07:42] unlike in the old testament the blood of
[1:07:45] the animals they just covered their sins
[1:07:47] but the blood of jesus doesn't do that
[1:07:49] it wipes it clean
[1:07:51] the only thing jesus christ cannot do is
[1:07:53] remember your sins
[1:07:55] so when you come to him in true
[1:07:57] repentance he is not going to remember
[1:07:59] none of that
[1:08:00] so the devil your accuser he cannot come
[1:08:02] back to you
[1:08:03] and point you in at what you did all we
[1:08:06] have to do is stop playing church
[1:08:08] stop going to the things we are not
[1:08:10] supposed to be doing
[1:08:12] and turn to god and say lord just one
[1:08:15] more time lord
[1:08:16] and say lord we are willing to die to
[1:08:19] our sins
[1:08:20] we are willing to die and raise up in
[1:08:22] the power of the holy ghost
[1:08:25] and all my sins is struck out by the
[1:08:27] blood of jesus christ
[1:08:29] and the holy ghost is come as an
[1:08:30] abstract to the title deed
[1:08:32] and god gave me that by grace by
[1:08:35] foreknowledge
[1:08:36] before you were born that was yours
[1:08:39] before
[1:08:40] you had gotten into that place before
[1:08:42] samsung was
[1:08:43] was in that place of here before he had
[1:08:46] sold out his secret to delilah
[1:08:48] by foreknowledge that was given to him
[1:08:51] the victory was given to him
[1:08:53] you see when you start failing it is not
[1:08:56] on god but it is on you
[1:08:58] when you leave the principles of god
[1:09:00] that's when troubles will start falling
[1:09:02] on you
[1:09:03] all we just have to do is get back into
[1:09:05] the world where christ put us
[1:09:07] this is where this is where samsung was
[1:09:09] at he just had to get back
[1:09:11] on course to get back on the cause that
[1:09:14] god had brought him on the earth for
[1:09:17] and he says what are you scared about he
[1:09:19] said fear not i am he that was dead
[1:09:22] and alive again i'm alive forevermore
[1:09:25] and they have the keys of death and hell
[1:09:28] don't worry about nothing
[1:09:30] even death ain't gonna hurt you notice
[1:09:33] the abstract title the debt is settled
[1:09:36] everything against it has been struck
[1:09:38] off
[1:09:39] he says it might act silly but this is
[1:09:42] really good
[1:09:43] and abstract deed do you realize what
[1:09:45] that means
[1:09:47] there is nothing that can take it away
[1:09:49] from you i'm a holder
[1:09:51] the moment you have that deed satan
[1:09:54] cannot touch it
[1:09:55] you have power back the power that adam
[1:09:58] lost
[1:09:59] it is back with you you have dominion
[1:10:01] over everything
[1:10:02] it is for you to use god has given us to
[1:10:05] use whilst we are here on earth
[1:10:07] to have this victory he says i now
[1:10:10] what did i now have cashed in on my
[1:10:12] beneficiary
[1:10:14] his dirt his burial and resurrection and
[1:10:16] he became me
[1:10:18] that i might become him he became sin so
[1:10:21] that we might become his righteousness
[1:10:23] hallelujah he became a sinner amen so
[1:10:26] that we could become
[1:10:27] sons and now we can walk and just say we
[1:10:29] are sons of god
[1:10:31] because of that title deed those signs
[1:10:33] shall follow them that believe
[1:10:35] that's the abstract title deed so
[1:10:37] samsung was right there in that place
[1:10:39] he is calling lord please just one more
[1:10:42] time
[1:10:43] feel me one more time and tears started
[1:10:46] feeling
[1:10:46] those sockets those empty sockets where
[1:10:49] his eyes used to be
[1:10:50] they didn't realize that he was getting
[1:10:52] his spiritual eyes back
[1:10:54] and he was crying lord just one more
[1:10:56] time he said lord i want to feel it one
[1:10:59] more time again
[1:11:00] and the lord had his prayer god said if
[1:11:03] my people who are called by my name
[1:11:06] if they humble themselves and pray i
[1:11:07] will hear from heaven
[1:11:09] and i will come down and i will heal
[1:11:10] their land this is what god was coming
[1:11:13] he was coming down back on the scene
[1:11:16] where samson was
[1:11:17] eyes tears filling in his uh eyeless
[1:11:21] sockets
[1:11:22] and he asked the boy and he said lead me
[1:11:24] to where the two posts are we need that
[1:11:26] word
[1:11:27] to lead us to that place where we gotta
[1:11:29] have the victory back
[1:11:31] because that's where only we can find
[1:11:32] our victory and he started walking and
[1:11:35] you went there by those two pillars
[1:11:37] this philistines didn't realize what was
[1:11:39] going on
[1:11:40] he was standing right there he's feeling
[1:11:42] his muscles
[1:11:43] flexing he started feeling that power
[1:11:45] coming back and he's crying lord
[1:11:48] just one more time lord give me victory
[1:11:51] one more time
[1:11:52] i'm willing to die to what i have done
[1:11:55] before
[1:11:56] i'm sorry lord for what i've done just
[1:11:58] one more time
[1:11:59] come lord feel me may you avenge me of
[1:12:02] these philistines
[1:12:03] that's what we ought to do the cause
[1:12:06] that we were brought on this earth
[1:12:08] we are supposed to destroy all the
[1:12:09] devils old shin that comes our way
[1:12:12] because we know god is our mighty
[1:12:15] conqueror
[1:12:15] he is the king of kings we are the kings
[1:12:18] and we are supposed to do what kings do
[1:12:20] we are supposed to overcome everything
[1:12:22] that comes our way
[1:12:24] we just gotta repent and ask god to come
[1:12:27] and have full preeminence in our lives
[1:12:29] and just cry lord just one more time
[1:12:32] come feel us and he was standing right
[1:12:35] there the back of many and he was there
[1:12:38] and he started pushing those pillars
[1:12:41] still praying lord avenge me of those
[1:12:43] philistines
[1:12:44] and then he pulled he started feeling
[1:12:46] the strength coming back
[1:12:48] the logs were coming back that's what we
[1:12:51] got to do
[1:12:52] get that holy spirit back on track get
[1:12:54] it back within you
[1:12:56] and god will start working wonders the
[1:12:59] testimonies you used to have
[1:13:00] back then he will start doing that with
[1:13:03] you all those signs and wonders he
[1:13:05] promised to you and me
[1:13:06] is gonna start happening back again if
[1:13:09] we pray for the holy spirit to come back
[1:13:11] down on us
[1:13:12] and there he was he was pushing lord one
[1:13:15] more time
[1:13:16] and he gave that final push and the
[1:13:18] whole building came tumbling down
[1:13:20] three thousand philly stands died that
[1:13:23] day and he had the greatest victory that
[1:13:25] he
[1:13:25] ever had in his whole life because he
[1:13:28] had tried to go back
[1:13:29] to where he had come from he was gone
[1:13:32] back lord
[1:13:32] just one more time give me that strength
[1:13:35] if we are if we are able to get into
[1:13:37] that position this afternoon
[1:13:39] to say lord what we had in the beginning
[1:13:42] when we met you lord we need that same
[1:13:45] strength
[1:13:46] we miss having that connection we miss
[1:13:49] that joy of our salvation
[1:13:51] if we are just able to say lord just one
[1:13:54] more time
[1:13:55] come feel us he is able to do it he is
[1:13:57] able to open our spiritual eyes
[1:14:00] he is able to give us that strength that
[1:14:02] overcoming power
[1:14:04] that sin that used to have a hold in you
[1:14:06] that dirty habit that used to have a
[1:14:08] hold in you
[1:14:09] it won't have no claim on you when you
[1:14:11] cry just once more lord all those evil
[1:14:15] things that you know you were doing
[1:14:17] it will stop because a man would have
[1:14:20] because you would have surrendered
[1:14:21] yourself to god and allow him to have
[1:14:24] full preeminence in your life
[1:14:26] if you just cried just one more time the
[1:14:28] lord will open a way back
[1:14:30] for you to get back where you were
[1:14:32] coming from amen because when he is
[1:14:34] going to come he's
[1:14:35] going to come and find a perfect bride a
[1:14:38] bride that
[1:14:39] resembles him a perfect bride that's in
[1:14:41] the stage of a perfect man
[1:14:43] and that's the only way the holy spirit
[1:14:45] will beat us into what christ is looking
[1:14:48] for
[1:14:48] amen just like the gold a gold panner
[1:14:51] when the when they are beating that goal
[1:14:53] they're going to beat it until it's pure
[1:14:55] until they can see a reflection of their
[1:14:58] face
[1:14:58] in that gold that's what god is trying
[1:15:00] to do for you and me this evening
[1:15:02] he is trying those trials that's coming
[1:15:05] our way
[1:15:06] it's for us to overcome but we cannot
[1:15:08] overcome it if we don't have the holy
[1:15:09] ghost
[1:15:10] but if we cry just one more time lord we
[1:15:13] are able to go through it
[1:15:14] and we are purified until god can see
[1:15:17] himself through us
[1:15:19] he can see himself when he is looking at
[1:15:21] us and
[1:15:22] we are like christ cause that's what
[1:15:24] he's looking for if we are only able to
[1:15:26] cry
[1:15:27] just once more lord he will be able to
[1:15:29] hear your cry amen
[1:15:31] let us stand up on our feet
[1:15:39] god is not just going to come to your
[1:15:40] rescue until you call for him
[1:15:43] he is waiting for you to cry lord save
[1:15:46] me
[1:15:47] say lord help me i lied when the pastor
[1:15:50] was preaching earlier on
[1:15:51] don't be like the rich young ruler what
[1:15:53] should i do
[1:15:55] god is going to give you the law but
[1:15:57] don't do that just say
[1:15:58] lord save me god has grace for us
[1:16:02] we just have to stand in his presence
[1:16:04] and say lord
[1:16:05] please save me the moment you say lord i
[1:16:08] need your help
[1:16:09] lord save me he is going to come down
[1:16:12] and he's going to help you
[1:16:14] the bible says when peter he was he was
[1:16:16] sinking
[1:16:17] we don't know how far god was from him
[1:16:19] jesus was from him
[1:16:21] but the moment he says lord save me
[1:16:24] the bible says immediately god reached
[1:16:27] out to him
[1:16:28] it don't matter how far he was god
[1:16:31] immediately
[1:16:32] got a hold of him and he saved them so
[1:16:34] no matter what it is just cry
[1:16:36] why just once more lord god is able to
[1:16:39] deliver you and save you amen

[1:26:02] i have received of the lord that which
[1:26:04] also i deliver
[1:26:06] i delivered unto you that the lord jesus
[1:26:10] the same night in which he
[1:26:11] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:26:15] given thanks he break it
[1:26:17] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:26:19] is broken for you
[1:26:21] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:26:24] same manner also he took the cup
[1:26:26] when he had sucked saying this cup
[1:26:30] is the new testament in my blood this to
[1:26:32] e as often as you drink it
[1:26:34] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:26:37] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:26:40] show the lord's deathly come wherefore
[1:26:43] whosoever eat this bread and drink this
[1:26:45] cup of the lord
[1:26:46] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:26:49] and blood of the lord
[1:26:50] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:26:53] him eat of that bread and drink up that
[1:26:56] cup
[1:26:56] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:26:58] unworthily
[1:26:59] eat it and drink damnation to himself
[1:27:02] not discerning the lord's body but this
[1:27:05] cause
[1:27:06] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:27:08] many sleep
[1:27:09] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:27:11] should not be judged
[1:27:13] but when you are judged we are chastened
[1:27:15] of the lord
[1:27:16] that ye should not be condemned with the
[1:27:18] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:27:21] come together to eat tarry one for
[1:27:23] another
[1:27:24] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:27:26] home
[1:27:27] that he come not all together
[1:27:30] unto condemnation and the rest will i
[1:27:33] set an order
[1:27:34] when i come those of you who are
[1:27:38] participating may come up forward
[1:27:41] as i break the bread and then i'll pray
[1:27:43] over it
[1:27:53] dear heavenly father we thank you o god
[1:27:55] for your grace and your mercy
[1:27:57] we thank you for the breaking of the
[1:27:58] bread father we pray that you would
[1:28:01] bless each and every soul who are
[1:28:04] participating tonight if there be some
[1:28:07] sick and afflicted we pray father god
[1:28:09] that you will
[1:28:11] heal them lord for your prophet told us
[1:28:13] that there was virtue
[1:28:15] in the cup so we thank you lord dear
[1:28:18] jesus for everything that you do for us
[1:28:19] today
[1:28:21] and everything you've done for us we
[1:28:23] know that within ourselves
[1:28:25] we're not worthy but we're standing on
[1:28:28] the promises lord in your grace
[1:28:30] so we thank you right now as we honor
[1:28:32] you today through the breaking of the
[1:28:34] bread and the drinking of the wine
[1:28:37] not of what you will do but what you
[1:28:39] have already done for us
[1:28:41] dear jesus keep us in your care as we
[1:28:44] pray in jesus christ's name
[1:28:54] amen
[1:29:43] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:29:45] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:29:48] which is broken for you this student
[1:29:50] remembers of me let us eat
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:19] after the same manner also he took the
[1:30:21] cup when he had sup
[1:30:23] saying this is the cup for the new
[1:30:25] testament in my blood this dude is often
[1:30:28] and she's drinking in remembrance of me

[1:46:42] scripture before we are dismissed
[1:46:46] i'm just going to read psalms 32
[1:46:50] this was one of the scriptures that when
[1:46:52] god saved me
[1:46:54] amen he gave me the scripture
[1:46:57] i read it and never fully understood it
[1:46:59] until i came to this message
[1:47:02] beginning at the first verse
[1:47:06] it says blessed is he whose
[1:47:07] transgression is forgiven
[1:47:10] whose sin is covered blessed is the man
[1:47:14] unto whom the lord imputed not iniquity
[1:47:17] and whose part whose spirit there is no
[1:47:19] guile
[1:47:21] brother branham said that's the bride
[1:47:23] when i kept silent
[1:47:24] my bones waxed all through my roaring
[1:47:27] all the day long
[1:47:29] but day and night thy hand was heavy
[1:47:32] upon me
[1:47:34] my moisture is turned into the drought
[1:47:37] of summer salah
[1:47:39] i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my
[1:47:41] iniquities have i not heard
[1:47:43] i said i would confess my transgressions
[1:47:46] unto the lord and thou forgaveth the
[1:47:49] iniquities of my sins
[1:47:51] salah so i thank god for that
[1:47:54] this is what we were all about here
[1:47:56] tonight
[1:47:58] dealing with communion working with
[1:47:59] communion
[1:48:01] we understand by god's grace that
[1:48:03] because of christ
[1:48:05] we can stand here feeling free
[1:48:08] knowing that we are free we thank god
[1:48:11] for his grace and his mercy amen
