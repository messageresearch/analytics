[40:32] do whatever you is that you want to do
[40:34] Lord we're at your service father or we
[40:36] just surrender our entire lives into
[40:38] your hands this morning father that you
[40:40] might have all the preeminence and all
[40:42] the glory and all the honor and we just
[40:44] thank you Lord for all things and the
[40:45] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[40:49] hey it could be seated I just wanted to
[40:53] preach a message this morning called
[40:55] when I needed you the most
[40:58] amen I think all this commitment has
[41:02] experienced times our lives where where
[41:05] you get to a place where you're at your
[41:09] wits in as we say you know you you've
[41:12] done all you can do you don't know what
[41:14] else to do the time when you need Christ
[41:18] the most amen is a time where all of
[41:21] your human efforts have failed all of
[41:24] your you
[41:25] ability and you you try to do this you
[41:27] try to do that you get to a point where
[41:29] everything you've tried just isn't
[41:30] working and all since sometimes as we
[41:33] wait until that time to turn to the Lord
[41:35] you know really in reality we should
[41:38] turn to the Lord and die out to
[41:41] ourselves at first every day but but
[41:43] sometimes you know you get you get to
[41:45] the point where you start relying on
[41:47] your own human ability and your own
[41:50] human strength and when you start
[41:53] relying on your human strength the Lord
[41:55] only let that go on for so long before
[41:58] he'll bring you to a situation in your
[42:00] life to where you can no longer handle
[42:02] it yourself you know you start trusting
[42:06] in your own ways and your own measures
[42:08] and your own ideas for so long God will
[42:11] bring you to a place where your own ways
[42:13] your own measures your own ideas won't
[42:15] work Amen God will bring you to a place
[42:18] where you so need him amen God is just
[42:22] waiting for a real purpose in your life
[42:25] something in your life to bring you to a
[42:27] place to where you're you're just in a
[42:30] place where you finally need Christ a
[42:34] man and the ral of is is you actually
[42:36] needed him all along but what God wants
[42:39] you to come to the point where you
[42:40] realize that you need him amen and and
[42:44] we we all ought to get good at realizing
[42:48] our need for Christ amen not just in the
[42:51] major things but all the little things
[42:53] not just every once in a while but
[42:55] needing him every day of our lives
[42:58] amen because as we read there are as a
[43:02] he city so it says the st. Paul there my
[43:05] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[43:08] strength is made perfect in weakness a
[43:12] man whose weakness was that that was
[43:14] Paul's weakness amen
[43:16] Christ is saying there my grace and my
[43:20] strength is for you my grace is for you
[43:27] my strength is for you amen this is what
[43:31] you need of he says but it cannot be
[43:34] manifested until you begin to manifest
[43:37] your
[43:38] enos amen until your weakness is
[43:41] manifested then my grace cannot be
[43:43] manifested and my strength cannot be
[43:45] manifested Amen who who here would like
[43:48] to see the grace of the Lord at work in
[43:50] your life
[43:51] amen who here would love to see the
[43:53] grace of the Lord at work in your life
[43:56] amen in your situation Amen in in every
[44:00] little problem you're going through
[44:02] right now and the things that are
[44:03] troubling your mind watching the grace
[44:05] of Lord to sin down from God out of
[44:08] heaven and coming down upon your
[44:10] situation awesome the Grace and the
[44:12] mercy Lord comes down in that situation
[44:14] and what the strength of the Lord also
[44:17] comes with remember what happens after
[44:20] the grace Bloor is manifested then comes
[44:22] the strength of the Lord every time
[44:25] whenever God begins to manifest His
[44:27] grace in your life then the strength
[44:29] Lord comes and right behind it to follow
[44:31] up upon his grace amen by one thing it
[44:34] requires as it requires our weakness
[44:37] amen I just wanted to read a quote here
[44:39] of brother branham's from coming from a
[44:43] sermon he preached there perfect
[44:45] strength or perfect strength by perfect
[44:48] weakness I've always loved just the
[44:50] title that one a man he says there in
[44:53] paragraph 56 he says the important thing
[44:57] one of the important things that we must
[44:59] master now remember this especially you
[45:03] young creatures and lay members alike
[45:05] there's one thing that we've got to
[45:07] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[45:11] desire in our life amen who here would
[45:15] like to fulfill God's desire you know
[45:17] God has a desire for your life amen when
[45:20] Christ died upon the cross he had you in
[45:23] his mind a man it's not just that he had
[45:26] you in his mind B he had you in his mind
[45:28] fulfilling certain attributes of Christ
[45:31] amen and so we all spend our days on
[45:35] this earth fulfilling whatever is at
[45:38] Christ had in his mind when he died on
[45:40] the cross hey man that's why we're here
[45:42] there's one thing that we've got to
[45:45] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[45:48] desire in our life that is we have to
[45:51] master the thought
[45:52] of human ability if we ever get to a
[45:55] spot where we think that we can do it
[45:57] with our own intelligence and our own
[45:59] abilities we've got to master that in
[46:02] such a way that we can get rid of the
[46:04] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[46:07] use us that's right and make a complete
[46:10] surrender we cannot use one ability we
[46:13] got to make a complete surrender amen
[46:17] a total surrender you know really until
[46:20] we until we make a total surrender God
[46:23] cannot use this why because he will not
[46:25] let his ability be mixed with our
[46:27] ability a meant until we make a total
[46:30] surrender he will because God will not
[46:32] allow his glory to be mixed with someone
[46:35] else's glory I meant it says here his
[46:38] way or it's not his way a meant you know
[46:43] when we when we have say you have a
[46:45] little pet temptation they meant
[46:47] something that you are always stumbling
[46:49] with something always you know whenever
[46:52] the Satan comes and puts the temptation
[46:54] right here you fall and it's like Satan
[46:56] has a little button in your life that
[46:58] whenever Satan pushes that button you
[47:00] stumble you know and and you go on
[47:03] through life you're painting of it you
[47:04] think you made things right and all of a
[47:06] sudden sync comes along pushes the
[47:08] button again and you stumble and fall
[47:10] well not to be that way and really and
[47:14] tell you and tell you you finally get
[47:16] down to your wits in then you say Lord
[47:18] I've had enough you know I'm tired of
[47:22] this thing and I tell you you get so
[47:24] weak God's gonna let that button sit
[47:26] right there you know but God is able to
[47:28] disable that button
[47:29] amen God is able to to demolish that
[47:33] button to remove it out of service take
[47:35] it out of the way why because it's not
[47:37] God's desire to have a button like that
[47:40] in your life amen but but but all of us
[47:43] have the possibility of having such a
[47:46] button installed a meant something where
[47:49] where you you just are always stumbled
[47:52] in this one area and Satan come along
[47:53] push the button you stone and whether
[47:55] that comes from that's coming from
[47:57] something that you have you've allowed
[47:59] to become your pet something that you
[48:02] you're holding on to something that
[48:04] you're you just
[48:06] don't aren't ready to get your wits into
[48:08] about it yet because part of you enjoys
[48:09] I think but you but when you when you
[48:12] finally get down you say Lord it is more
[48:16] important for me to get rid of this and
[48:18] it is for me to live itself amen when it
[48:22] finally gets down to the point where
[48:23] like lord I would rather die than live
[48:26] another day without giving full glory
[48:29] into you or haven't you have the full
[48:31] preeminence in my life amen because
[48:33] Christ deserves to have the entire the
[48:37] full preeminence in our lives a man he
[48:40] deserves to have the highest place Amen
[48:42] when you have one little thing that you
[48:44] cannot surrender to the God then your
[48:47] detracting from God's presence in your
[48:49] life amen when you attract him from
[48:52] God's presence he cannot have the full
[48:54] preeminence and the full use out of your
[48:57] life amen when he puts you on this earth
[49:00] to manifest his greatness to manifest
[49:02] what His grace and his strength in your
[49:05] life amen but when you won't manifest
[49:07] weakness then he cannot manifest
[49:11] strength and grace amen but it requires
[49:15] our weakness it's not and not just any
[49:18] weakness but our perfect weakness well
[49:20] we come before the Lord and say Lord I
[49:22] can't do this anymore
[49:23] Lord I've tried everything I know how to
[49:26] do I've tried I've tried to get rid of
[49:29] this I tried to do this I tried to do
[49:30] that but I'm I'm done Laura I'm at my
[49:33] wit's end I can't go any further
[49:34] Lord I need a total surrender Amen Lord
[49:38] I need this I need you to take this out
[49:40] of my life and I cannot do without you
[49:43] hey Mary it's just like you know you
[49:45] know when when if you remember the story
[49:47] of Gideon you know he was a weak man hey
[49:51] man you know the story how many times
[49:52] has been preached John he was the the
[49:54] weakest man of his family and his family
[49:58] was the weakest of their tribe and their
[50:00] tribe was the weakest tribe in all of
[50:02] Israel and he wasn't a bad and they were
[50:05] constantly having the enemy come and see
[50:07] they harvest their crops and then you
[50:10] come and steal the crops and they were
[50:12] getting weaker and weaker by the day
[50:14] they weren't eaten right they were there
[50:16] their children were eating right they
[50:18] were they were
[50:19] bad shape but when he finally got down
[50:22] to as weak as he could get an angel Lord
[50:25] came by amen and as well as that pattern
[50:29] repeats itself throughout history then
[50:31] whenever somebody got down to such a
[50:33] place remember
[50:37] Sera's Abraham and Sarah when she had
[50:40] the servant you know and and Ishmael was
[50:42] born and when Ishmael was Sarah kicked
[50:48] her sermon out of the house and she went
[50:50] out into the desert with Ishmael and and
[50:51] the baby was starving she couldn't feed
[50:54] it and she probably laid the baby at
[50:56] crying baby under a bush and she said I
[50:59] can't I'll just lay I'm gonna walk off
[51:02] over here on the other side of the hill
[51:03] so I don't have to hear him die she was
[51:05] in a bad position
[51:06] amen she was in a bad position but it
[51:09] was at that time winged the angel the
[51:11] Lord came and talked to her amen and God
[51:14] waits until you get to that place but if
[51:16] you are holding back from getting to
[51:18] that place
[51:18] then God cannot minister to you amen but
[51:22] until you finally get to the place where
[51:25] you can just shut down say Lord
[51:27] that's it I'm ceasing operations here I
[51:30] where we're putting in a stop to
[51:33] everything the Lord I can't go I my
[51:35] whole purpose in life is to serve you
[51:37] and I cannot serve you when I still have
[51:40] this that hasn't been taken care of in
[51:41] my life amen because that's why we came
[51:45] here in the first place was to serve
[51:47] Christ amen if we can't properly serve
[51:50] Christ because of something in our lives
[51:52] and everything should stop everything
[51:53] should halt until we get this thing
[51:55] taken care of
[51:57] Amen that's the whole reason we're here
[52:00] amen as we read there in Isaiah 61 Jesus
[52:05] does Jesus quote from this is a prophecy
[52:07] and Jesus came when he came in his day
[52:10] says this prophecy is being fulfilled
[52:12] right here in your ears and he said the
[52:15] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me a man
[52:18] you know whenever the Spirit of the Lord
[52:20] God is upon someone it's coming to act
[52:22] it's coming to do it's coming to fulfill
[52:25] something it's coming to a mat that's
[52:28] itself in this in the world
[52:30] so here the spirit of Lord God
[52:33] is upon me because the Lord hath
[52:35] anointed me he's annoying me too what to
[52:37] preach the good tidings under the meek
[52:39] he has sent me to bind up the
[52:40] brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the
[52:43] captives and the opening of the prison
[52:45] to them that are bound amen so in order
[52:47] for this scripture to be fulfilled there
[52:49] had to be some meat people on the earth
[52:51] a man there had to be some folks that
[52:53] were brokenhearted amen how these people
[52:56] get brokenhearted because of things that
[52:58] happened to them a long life's journey
[53:00] amen the to proclaim Liberty to the
[53:04] captives and the opening of the prison
[53:06] to them that are bound you know and we
[53:08] all know that some people are not just
[53:09] bound with real bars but they're bound
[53:12] with situations in the life that they
[53:13] just can't seem to take care of
[53:15] themselves amen but the Holy Spirit is
[53:17] here to proclaim Liberty to the captives
[53:20] the opening of the prison to them that
[53:22] are bound that bind up those that are
[53:24] brokenhearted why so that their heart
[53:26] can be made whole why so they can live
[53:27] at peace with it so they can draw me
[53:30] nearer closer near to me or look to you
[53:33] Oh Lord amen or because God has a
[53:36] presence for us to draw into a man God
[53:40] has a presence that he wants us to enjoy
[53:41] drinking amen in the presence of Jehovah
[53:44] his healing his peace deliverance
[53:50] fulfill Ness and life amen
[53:53] in the presence of Jehovah all of your
[53:55] all of your deep deep desires can be
[53:59] fulfilled in the presence of Jehovah and
[54:01] if you have something that you that
[54:03] you're longing for in life you just get
[54:06] before his presence he'll take care of
[54:07] it all amen you can either remove the
[54:10] desire or he can fulfill the desire one
[54:12] or the other but no matter why it can be
[54:13] taken care of when you have who created
[54:16] desire in the first place God did Amen
[54:20] why did God create desires to give us
[54:22] motivation amen that's what desires are
[54:25] for to give us to motivate us in one
[54:27] direction now Satan can pervert those
[54:30] desires and motivates in the wrong
[54:32] direction but God is here the Holy
[54:34] Spirit is here to give you deliverance
[54:36] from that captivity amen
[54:38] now if you're a captive to a good desire
[54:40] Amen then there's a motivation there to
[54:42] get you to fulfill that desire but if
[54:45] there's a desire in your life that you
[54:46] have
[54:47] that is a good desire but you cannot
[54:49] seem to fulfill in your own natural
[54:50] ability then your motivation is to the
[54:53] presence of Jehovah amen and when you
[54:55] lay your feet of his presence you say
[54:57] Lord I got this desire in my life and I
[54:59] can't seem to fulfill it but lor it's a
[55:01] good desire it's it's for this four-year
[55:03] Akeem it was for your glory and Lord I
[55:06] have a need Philippi fulfilled in my
[55:07] life I think the president's Lord could
[55:09] come down he can heal he can deliver he
[55:12] can he can write the check no matter
[55:15] what it is you put the check in the bank
[55:17] of heaven and it will clear I'll deposit
[55:19] and the desire be fulfilled in your life
[55:21] a mess like a woman when she has wants
[55:25] to have a child and she finds out
[55:27] there's some medical reason that she
[55:28] cannot have that child then there's a
[55:30] God in heaven that gave the desire there
[55:33] was a God in heaven that can answer the
[55:35] desire amen
[55:37] I mean if a man wants to wants to
[55:41] provide for his family and as a desire
[55:45] to provide for his family or then God
[55:48] has able to answer and fulfill that
[55:51] desire amen if if a man's children need
[55:54] something thank God and a man cannot
[55:57] provide for that neat then God in heaven
[55:59] has ability if that man would just
[56:01] submit himself and become weak before
[56:04] God God can answer the need a member
[56:08] when we get to the point where we need
[56:10] him the most amen remember God didn't
[56:13] choose when God chose Gideon he didn't
[56:16] choose the second weakest mantle and he
[56:18] didn't choose the third weakest man or
[56:20] the fourth weakest man he chose the
[56:22] weakest man land to fulfill his word
[56:24] amen God had something that was needed
[56:28] in his in his in his kingdom their needs
[56:32] in God's kingdom God chose the weakest
[56:34] man I mean the same thing as today God
[56:37] still has needs in his kingdom God still
[56:40] has needs in this church God has needs
[56:42] in your life amen bye until we by God we
[56:45] cannot see the grace of the Lord and the
[56:47] strength of the Lord until first Christ
[56:49] sees our weakness first amen it's not
[56:53] just Christ seeing our weakness but us
[56:55] seeing our weakness and coming to the
[56:58] Lord and submitting to him in prayer
[57:00] a man he said that he would appoint unto
[57:04] them that mourn in Zion to give them
[57:07] beauty for Ashes and the oil of joy for
[57:10] mourning the garment of praise for the
[57:12] spirit of heaviness amen whose mourning
[57:15] in Zion Amen brother bran one-time use
[57:19] in questions answers he was talking
[57:21] about the evidence of the Holy Ghost he
[57:23] says you know the rule there's really
[57:24] only one true evidence of the Holy Ghost
[57:27] and that is when you're fulfilling the
[57:29] word for your hour when you're when
[57:31] you're fulfilling the word for your day
[57:33] I mean whatever the word is for your day
[57:36] when you're following that word you're
[57:37] you you've submitted yourself underneath
[57:39] that word and said yes the name and of
[57:41] the word that's an evidence of the Holy
[57:43] Ghost work in your life but he says but
[57:45] if you really want to nail it down if
[57:46] you if you're just not satisfied with
[57:48] that I can give you another evidence he
[57:51] says that's those that sigh and cry from
[57:53] the for the abominations down the city
[57:56] those that sigh and cry for the lost
[57:58] souls in the city those a sigh and cry
[58:01] for the things those that are out of the
[58:02] way enzyme amen amen he it was a Christ
[58:08] has come with his anointing to point
[58:10] unto them that mourn in Zion a man whose
[58:13] mornings I ought to be us it's the
[58:15] evidence one of the evidences of us the
[58:18] Holy Ghost as we will mourn and cry
[58:20] inside for the abominations that are
[58:22] done in the city
[58:23] amen remember the city was Jerusalem -
[58:26] amen it was God's people
[58:28] amen amen
[58:32] we ought not to be satisfied satisfied
[58:34] to see things in God's church in God's
[58:40] house God has a house everything ought
[58:43] to be in order
[58:44] amen you know I was that there's that
[58:50] phrase oh this is no way to run a
[58:51] railroad you know it's an old phrase an
[58:55] old English phrase one of the things
[58:58] that came from is in order to run a
[58:59] railroad things have to happen on a
[59:02] timely basis Amen if if the steam engine
[59:06] shows up in a town it's on a schedule
[59:08] the tank has to be full of water to
[59:11] refill the steam boiler and then if the
[59:13] takes not full water on the train gets
[59:15] there the things gonna be the things
[59:17] gonna be delayed if the trains running
[59:19] low on wood for the steam engine and it
[59:21] shows up on the port and they need more
[59:23] wood and there's gotta be wood already
[59:25] waiting there otherwise there's going to
[59:27] be a delay on the engine and if and if
[59:29] the tank is out of water if the wood
[59:32] stack is getting low this is no way to
[59:34] run a railroad amen and and and the same
[59:37] thing with God's kingdom the only way to
[59:39] run God's kingdom is with the baptism of
[59:41] the Holy Ghost amen and the only way to
[59:43] really properly run God's kingdom is
[59:46] with the Holy Ghost and fire in our
[59:48] lives and not just in our lives but on
[59:51] display upon the altar amen as Jesus
[59:54] himself said no man when he lights the
[59:56] candle
[59:57] we'll put it underneath the basket amen
[1:00:00] every man when he lights a candle he
[1:00:01] puts it on the high place so that all
[1:00:03] men can see it and perform work by it
[1:00:06] amen and so is us so when we were we're
[1:00:09] seeking the refreshing of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:11] and our lives I hope we all are hey I
[1:00:14] trust we all are if we're not then we
[1:00:16] got problems
[1:00:17] Amen because this is no way to run God's
[1:00:19] kingdom amen but we are seeking if we
[1:00:22] are seeking the revival of the Holy
[1:00:23] Ghost in our lives if we're seeking the
[1:00:26] renewal of the Holy Spirit a fresh water
[1:00:29] from the river every day amen Springs of
[1:00:32] living water in our lives if we're
[1:00:34] seeking that renewal then we ought to
[1:00:36] put that renewal on display in our lives
[1:00:39] amen otherwise we're guilty of putting
[1:00:41] our light under a bushel Amen Jesus if
[1:00:45] he came to this earth and said the
[1:00:46] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:00:48] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:00:50] good tidings of the meek
[1:00:51] he's anointed me to bind up the
[1:00:53] brokenhearted he's anointed me to
[1:00:54] proclaim Liberty to the captives
[1:00:56] he's anointed me to open the prison to
[1:00:58] them that are bound now the Holy Spirit
[1:01:00] has come upon us and what does the Holy
[1:01:03] Spirit gonna do when he comes upon us
[1:01:04] he's gonna anoint us and once we're in
[1:01:07] Oien ting what are we gonna do we're
[1:01:08] gonna go through all God's kingdom we're
[1:01:11] gonna preach the good tidings under the
[1:01:13] meek we're gonna bind up the
[1:01:15] brokenhearted we're gonna proclaim
[1:01:17] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[1:01:19] of the prison to them that are bound
[1:01:21] amen but when we see those that are
[1:01:23] bound to refuse to allow the Holy Ghost
[1:01:25] to miss or through us then we
[1:01:28] we're not doing we're doing despite to
[1:01:31] the very anointing that God has given us
[1:01:33] amen when you see some of those meat and
[1:01:36] when someone is out of the way and the
[1:01:39] Holy Spirit is upon you but you will not
[1:01:42] open your mouth to speak to that person
[1:01:43] then you're grieving the Holy Spirit
[1:01:47] we're with you're a baptized amen
[1:01:49] because God the whole reason that God
[1:01:51] gives out the Holy Spirit in the first
[1:01:52] place is for it to be used and you have
[1:01:55] the preeminence in your life amen but if
[1:01:57] you shut the Holy Spirit down by not
[1:01:59] because you got I realize if God ever
[1:02:01] gives you the Holy Ghost amen is for to
[1:02:04] fulfill this scripture right here amen
[1:02:07] that's one of the reasons why God gives
[1:02:08] us the Holy Ghost is to fulfill this
[1:02:11] scripture what was it Christ is the same
[1:02:13] yesterday today and forever have Christ
[1:02:17] at one time was anointed to bind up to
[1:02:20] set the the bind up the brokenhearted
[1:02:22] Christ is always anointed to buy at the
[1:02:25] brokenhearted and if Christ is in you
[1:02:27] and he will use you to bind up the
[1:02:29] brokenhearted amen so if you see the
[1:02:32] brokenhearted just be in mind that the
[1:02:34] Holy Ghost in you was sent to that
[1:02:37] person amen what was it why because
[1:02:39] Christ is the same if he's the same he's
[1:02:42] gonna be the same inside of you and when
[1:02:44] Christ gets down the inside of you he's
[1:02:46] not going to do some different act if
[1:02:48] he's not going to sit still and never
[1:02:50] interact with those that are lost
[1:02:53] amen as Jesus himself said it's not the
[1:02:56] it's not those that are healthy than
[1:02:58] either doctor it's those that are sick
[1:03:00] they need the doctor and he says and I
[1:03:01] have come to heal the sick I've come to
[1:03:04] bind up the brokenhearted and he was
[1:03:06] anointed to fulfill that amen now we
[1:03:08] hear who say that we have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:12] who say that we are full of the Holy
[1:03:14] Ghost and power of the Almighty God who
[1:03:16] realized that Christ is in you to
[1:03:18] fulfill the scripture he's the same
[1:03:19] yesterday today and forever amen and we
[1:03:22] got to fulfill that scripture he is the
[1:03:24] same the only way that we can do it is
[1:03:26] we've become perfectly weak in our own
[1:03:28] selves Amen when we become so weak in
[1:03:31] our own selves we die out to ourselves
[1:03:33] in the morning say lord I need you to
[1:03:35] fulfill your scriptures this day in my
[1:03:37] life
[1:03:38] otherwise why are we here
[1:03:41] Amen Jesus Christ said I do nothing but
[1:03:44] what my father shows me a man when was
[1:03:47] the last time the father showed you
[1:03:48] something
[1:03:51] and how if Jesus Christ came and said
[1:03:54] I'd do nothing until my father shows me
[1:03:57] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:04:00] forever and he's living and moving and
[1:04:03] having his bean inside of you then
[1:04:05] there's gotta be some showing going on
[1:04:08] amen there's gotta be something showing
[1:04:11] going on why because Christ has to take
[1:04:13] from the fall he says I'll take from the
[1:04:15] father and I'll give it to you a man
[1:04:18] there's got to be a change a change of
[1:04:21] possession where God where Christ takes
[1:04:24] things from the father and gives them
[1:04:26] unto you well you got ya that means he
[1:04:28] has to reveal something to you
[1:04:30] I meant when was the last time Christ
[1:04:32] revealed something to you if Christ has
[1:04:35] not revealed anything to you recently
[1:04:37] then there's probably something blocked
[1:04:39] somewhere you've become blind your
[1:04:41] latest is having its way with you amen
[1:04:43] and we're not here to have we're not
[1:04:45] here to fulfill those scriptures we're
[1:04:48] here to fulfill the scriptures of the
[1:04:49] overcomer amen some people will be
[1:04:51] guilty of fulfilling that they're
[1:04:53] lukewarm they're powerless they're blind
[1:04:56] and they don't know where they're where
[1:04:58] they're going somebody's gonna have to
[1:05:00] fulfill that Scripture it shouldn't be
[1:05:02] us
[1:05:03] it shouldn't be by this claims to have
[1:05:05] the Holy Ghost to have the baptism
[1:05:07] saying that they're immersed in the Holy
[1:05:10] Spirit of the Living God anybody that
[1:05:12] says that they are immersed immersed in
[1:05:14] such a spirit should have the evidence
[1:05:16] of that spirit working in their lives
[1:05:19] amen otherwise we're blind and we cannot
[1:05:22] see afar off amen but if Christ is
[1:05:26] revealing himself to you you have all
[1:05:28] the channels open and he'll come and
[1:05:30] he'll reveal himself to you and you can
[1:05:32] go and he can say oh I want you to turn
[1:05:34] to the right I want you to turn to the
[1:05:36] left I want you to say this to so-and-so
[1:05:38] I will just say that to so-and-so I want
[1:05:40] you to get down and pray for this person
[1:05:41] this person is in need right now I need
[1:05:44] you to pray for him why you know you
[1:05:46] know it's just like the other day I was
[1:05:49] going through something and I can't hear
[1:05:52] and I was preaching and and we
[1:05:54] afterwards
[1:05:55] people can't for prayer and as I was
[1:05:57] praying a thought came across my mind
[1:05:59] but who's gonna pray for me just because
[1:06:03] I just going through something you know
[1:06:04] and as we all do and anything I just
[1:06:07] kind of I put that I was busy you know I
[1:06:09] was mystery you know so I took that
[1:06:11] thought I put off on the side and and I
[1:06:13] went on praying for the people well I
[1:06:17] walked out there we were talking and
[1:06:20] brother rich comes up to me he says I
[1:06:23] want to talk to you he pulls me into the
[1:06:25] office he says the Lord told me to pray
[1:06:27] for you and I'm never gonna forget that
[1:06:32] the rest of my life that one little
[1:06:34] thought came across my mind I took it I
[1:06:36] put another sigh but God was faithful
[1:06:38] and he had someone who was available
[1:06:41] that the Holy Spirit could use he says I
[1:06:44] have an open channel I'm gonna come my
[1:06:47] brother rich and I have an open channel
[1:06:49] where I can use my brother rich in that
[1:06:51] channel that spirit quickened brother
[1:06:53] Rich's body he walks out of here he
[1:06:56] opens his mouth and says what God puts
[1:06:58] in his mouth Amen that's the Holy Spirit
[1:07:01] is working in the truth amen
[1:07:03] and that's just a little thing God the
[1:07:06] Holy Spirit is here to do that every day
[1:07:08] in every one of our lives amen but we
[1:07:11] must have the channels open
[1:07:12] Amen we must have the channels open we
[1:07:15] must draw me nearer lure closer to thee
[1:07:18] and then not when then waiting there
[1:07:20] until we're actually drawn near a mess
[1:07:23] not just singing the same song every
[1:07:25] week draw me nearer Laura closer to thee
[1:07:28] and never actually having a testimony
[1:07:30] where you can say I sung this on God
[1:07:32] drawing me near a man there's got to be
[1:07:34] an answer back if we ever ask God one
[1:07:37] time to draw us near and we ought to
[1:07:39] wait until Christ draws us near
[1:07:42] otherwise we need to just rip that song
[1:07:44] the other song I never sing it again
[1:07:46] unless we have an expectation of faith
[1:07:48] that that song will come to pass in our
[1:07:50] lives we should never see it but we do
[1:07:53] sing it and we ought to have an
[1:07:55] expectation then it can be long Christ
[1:07:57] it's going to draw us near amen when we
[1:08:00] need him the most and we need him every
[1:08:03] single day amen if there ever is a day
[1:08:08] where you don't
[1:08:09] realize that you need Christ then that
[1:08:12] day when when when judgment comes at the
[1:08:16] end and all of our works are tried that
[1:08:18] they will burn up in the fire and never
[1:08:20] be remove no more and we lose out on
[1:08:23] roared Amen amen because we are here to
[1:08:27] be used by the holy spirit amen we're
[1:08:29] here to be available by the Holy Spirit
[1:08:31] amen we don't want to see our works
[1:08:33] burned up at the end hey man the only
[1:08:35] works that we'll see at the end or the
[1:08:37] works that the Holy Ghost has done
[1:08:39] through our life amen that shouldn't be
[1:08:41] a rare occurrence in our lives but
[1:08:43] through but through prayer and reading
[1:08:45] their Bible and submitting yourselves
[1:08:47] under the Holy Ghost Lord there will be
[1:08:49] things that we do that we'll never even
[1:08:51] know this side of Western amen the
[1:08:53] there's been prophesied that when we get
[1:08:55] to heaven we'll be saying when did we
[1:08:57] ever do this when did we ever see you or
[1:08:59] you were hungry when did we see you and
[1:09:01] you were a need he said Jesus said when
[1:09:03] you did it under the least of these my
[1:09:06] children you did it unto me amen
[1:09:09] and why did they do it unto the least of
[1:09:12] those because the Holy Spirit without
[1:09:13] them even knowing it moved upon their
[1:09:16] lives and they were walking living
[1:09:18] epistles without even knowing it amen it
[1:09:21] only comes by a surrendered life a meze
[1:09:24] I realize not only do we need him the
[1:09:26] most but he needs us the most and then
[1:09:29] Christ cannot fulfill his word without
[1:09:33] us amen and so we got to be in position
[1:09:36] amen to make sure his word gets
[1:09:38] fulfilled amen
[1:09:41] when you allow weaknesses in your life
[1:09:44] without ever submitting those weaknesses
[1:09:46] before Christ those weaknesses become
[1:09:49] excuses and those excuses become reasons
[1:09:52] why you cannot serve God the way you
[1:09:54] ought to amen so why we got to take
[1:09:57] those weaknesses and put them up on the
[1:09:58] altar instead of allowing those
[1:10:00] weaknesses that come pet sins in your
[1:10:03] life amen
[1:10:05] as Paul said you know not many strong
[1:10:07] not many noble not me rich not many high
[1:10:10] in stature were chosen but God has
[1:10:12] chosen the weak things in this life to
[1:10:15] confound the things that are mighty
[1:10:17] I mean he's chosen the weak things amen
[1:10:20] but until you become weak you cannot
[1:10:22] become chosen
[1:10:24] amen amen
[1:10:27] brother BAM and that's a message perfect
[1:10:29] strength by perfect weakness see he said
[1:10:32] you know there was a prayer meeting not
[1:10:33] too long ago where 150 thousand
[1:10:36] frostings and Catholics gathered
[1:10:38] together to pray to have a prayer
[1:10:41] meeting said 150 thousand gathered
[1:10:44] together to have a prayer meeting he
[1:10:46] says and God didn't even notice he says
[1:10:49] but you take one man one man in weakness
[1:10:53] before the Lord and he says and watch
[1:10:56] God move on that man's behalf just think
[1:10:59] 150,000 people praying and a prophet of
[1:11:02] our day said it didn't mean one thing to
[1:11:05] God but you take one man in weakness
[1:11:10] before God and it means more to him than
[1:11:12] all the world praying on the other side
[1:11:17] Amen why because God has chosen the weak
[1:11:19] things to confound the things that are
[1:11:22] better wise a man let's let's turn to
[1:11:25] psalms 107 i kind of a long scripture
[1:11:33] reading here to read before we close
[1:11:43] brief psalms 107 here but over in over
[1:11:50] in Psalms 103 he says that I'm saying
[1:11:56] quote this here Psalms 103 for he says
[1:11:58] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:12:00] who crowns me with loving-kindness and
[1:12:04] tender mercies Christ crowns us with
[1:12:09] loving-kindness and tender mercies I
[1:12:11] know I we went through this a while back
[1:12:12] and I was looking these words up and all
[1:12:15] the root words and trying to get
[1:12:17] understanding of what the what
[1:12:19] loving-kindness meant and what tender
[1:12:22] mercies really work and I was reading
[1:12:24] about loving-kindness that had really
[1:12:27] when you really broke it down and it had
[1:12:28] to do with when a man loves someone so
[1:12:31] much who is beneath him he takes that
[1:12:35] man he puts him up and he puts
[1:12:37] up on the same level with him he picks
[1:12:40] him up and he loves this man not not as
[1:12:43] a condescending love but as a man to man
[1:12:47] I love this person we are on equal
[1:12:49] footing loving kindness not just
[1:12:51] continent not just condescending love
[1:12:53] but loving loving kindness I have picked
[1:12:56] you up and now I am put you right here
[1:12:58] by my side I have chosen you I've chosen
[1:13:01] to pick you up out the ground I have
[1:13:03] chosen to grab you I've chosen to pull
[1:13:06] you into myself
[1:13:07] that's the loving kindness of the Lord
[1:13:08] not to say he's just willing to
[1:13:10] condescend to us down there and leave us
[1:13:12] down there but he picks us up and puts
[1:13:15] us up flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:13:17] bone that's the loving kindness of our
[1:13:19] God that he is willing to put us as a
[1:13:23] bride to his side he crowns us with his
[1:13:26] loving kindness amen and the tender
[1:13:28] mercies they're had when the root word
[1:13:31] that had to do with caressing like a man
[1:13:34] would like when they come down to it he
[1:13:38] said like a woman like a pregnant woman
[1:13:40] would would massage her belly when she
[1:13:42] puts her hand upon her belly because
[1:13:44] she's she has feelings of love toward
[1:13:47] her unborn baby amen that same tender
[1:13:50] mercies the same tender mercies that a
[1:13:53] woman would have towards her unborn
[1:13:55] child the same thoughts that a woman had
[1:13:57] half towards her unborn child as she
[1:13:59] rubs her belly that's the same thing
[1:14:01] that Christ has towards you with the
[1:14:04] tender mercies of Lord hey man the Bible
[1:14:06] says that he has crowned us with
[1:14:09] loving-kindness and tender mercies amen
[1:14:12] let's go to Psalms 107 Psalm 107 has
[1:14:18] within it has four different stories and
[1:14:23] the I'm going to read three of them here
[1:14:25] it's a long read so I'll pray that you
[1:14:27] have patience with me but it's a long
[1:14:30] read but the the first the first eight
[1:14:33] men eight verses of this chapter is a
[1:14:35] story about the redeemed out of Egypt
[1:14:38] Amen so let's just read here Psalms 107
[1:14:41] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[1:14:44] good for his mercy endureth forever let
[1:14:46] the redeemed of the Lord say so for whom
[1:14:49] he hath redeemed from
[1:14:51] and of the enemy he'd get and gather
[1:14:53] them out of the lands from the east and
[1:14:55] from the west of the north from the
[1:14:57] south they wandered in the wilderness in
[1:14:59] the solitary way they found no city to
[1:15:01] dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul
[1:15:04] fainted in them then they cried unto the
[1:15:07] Lord in their trouble and he delivered
[1:15:09] them out of their distresses he led them
[1:15:11] forth by the right hand that they might
[1:15:13] go to a city of habitation oh that men
[1:15:16] would praise the Lord for His goodness
[1:15:18] and for his wonderful works to the
[1:15:21] children of men that verse 8 there is
[1:15:23] repeated over and over again throughout
[1:15:24] this chapter well the turn of Israel
[1:15:27] there they are coming out of Egypt and
[1:15:29] when they came into the end of the end
[1:15:31] of the wilderness they were made weak
[1:15:33] and God delivered them out of the
[1:15:35] weakness gave them a place to live in
[1:15:38] and he says oh that men would praise
[1:15:40] Lord for His goodness and for his
[1:15:42] wonderful work so the children of men
[1:15:44] the next eight verses or so has to do
[1:15:49] with those that are bound by sickness
[1:15:50] and those that weren't sick those are
[1:15:54] bound by sickness and can't I get well
[1:15:56] and those that are in prison amen verse
[1:15:59] 9 for he satisfies the longing soul and
[1:16:03] fills the hungry soul with goodness such
[1:16:06] as sit in darkness and in the shadow of
[1:16:08] death being bound in an affliction and
[1:16:11] iron because they rebelled against the
[1:16:13] words of God and contemned the counsel
[1:16:16] of the Most High
[1:16:17] therefore he brought the he brought down
[1:16:19] their heart with labor and they fell
[1:16:21] down and there was none to help then
[1:16:24] they cried unto the Lord in their
[1:16:25] trouble and he saved them out of their
[1:16:27] distress he brought them out of darkness
[1:16:29] and the shadow of death and he break
[1:16:32] their bands in asunder oh that man would
[1:16:34] praise the Lord for His goodness and for
[1:16:37] his wonderful works and the children are
[1:16:38] meant to the children there today if
[1:16:40] ever one time God saves you if ever one
[1:16:44] time God heals you if ever one kind God
[1:16:47] delivers you from something that you
[1:16:49] could not deliver yourself out of and
[1:16:51] you got to praise the Lord God for that
[1:16:53] every day of your life Amen that
[1:16:55] constant remembrance before the Lord
[1:16:57] Lord I remember when I was sick and you
[1:17:00] healed me I remember when I need
[1:17:02] deliverance and you saved me
[1:17:03] IRA when I had this
[1:17:05] sinn I couldn't get out of my life and
[1:17:06] you took it away from me I remember when
[1:17:08] I was sick and you made me well I
[1:17:10] remember Lord and I'll worship from
[1:17:12] crazy for that amen oh that main would
[1:17:15] praise the Lord for His goodness and for
[1:17:18] his wonderful works to the children of
[1:17:19] men
[1:17:20] verse 16 amen this here talks about the
[1:17:25] mercy of God two fools amen
[1:17:28] for he hath broken the gates of brass
[1:17:31] and cut the bars of iron and asunder
[1:17:34] fools because of their transgression and
[1:17:37] because of their iniquities are
[1:17:38] afflicted their soul or soul of horath
[1:17:41] all manner of meat and they draw near
[1:17:43] unto the gates of death then they cry
[1:17:46] unto the Lord in their trouble and he
[1:17:48] say with them out of their distress he
[1:17:50] sent his word and healed them and

[1:18:14] could not do for themselves they ought
[1:18:16] to praise God every day of their lives
[1:18:18] a man I'm going to read this third story
[1:18:20] was to be the last one that will read
[1:18:22] but this is talking about mint and
[1:18:25] marinas and boats boatman when they're
[1:18:28] out on the seat they're at the mercy of
[1:18:30] the sea amen and let them sacrifice the
[1:18:36] sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare
[1:18:38] his works with her joy see they they go
[1:18:41] down to the sea and ships and do
[1:18:44] business in great waters these see the
[1:18:46] works of the Lord and His wonders in the
[1:18:48] deep for he commandeth and raises the
[1:18:51] stormy wind which lifted up the waves
[1:18:53] there they mount up to the heaven and
[1:18:55] they go down to the depths their soul is
[1:18:58] melted because of trouble they reel to
[1:19:01] and fro and stagger like a drunken man
[1:19:03] and art their wit's end
[1:19:05] then they crying to the Lord in their
[1:19:07] trouble and he bringeth them out of
[1:19:08] their distress he maketh the storm a
[1:19:11] calm so that the waves thereof are still
[1:19:13] then are they glad because they be quiet
[1:19:16] so he bringeth them unto their
[1:19:18] iron Haven oh the men would praise the
[1:19:21] Lord for His goodness and for his
[1:19:23] wonderful works to the children of men

[1:19:31] the testimony let them tell live to tell
[1:19:34] about it that God saved me have you ever
[1:19:36] been on I know I was on a sailboat once
[1:19:38] on Lake Michigan amen and the waves came
[1:19:41] up and and we were going down for you
[1:19:44] know three four seconds at a time and
[1:19:46] then we were going back up four three
[1:19:49] four seconds at a time and it was just
[1:19:50] people were leaning over the side of the
[1:19:52] boat half the boat was throwing up or
[1:19:54] the side of the boat and it was just you

[1:20:03] were at the mercy of the sea I've never
[1:20:05] experienced anything like that in my
[1:20:06] life
[1:20:06] and it was just amazing to me to realize
[1:20:09] as men went out there they're at the
[1:20:11] mercy of the sea but yet they can cry to
[1:20:13] the Lord he hears out of the heavens and
[1:20:17] all sudden the sea is calm and it's one
[1:20:21] thing to read by hear in the song so
[1:20:22] another thing to see a man upon this
[1:20:24] earth walk out on the stern of the boat
[1:20:26] like Jesus and said peace be calm and
[1:20:30] there's all instantly calm you know you

[1:20:58] from affliction and maketh him families
[1:21:01] like a flock the righteous shall see it
[1:21:03] and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop
[1:21:06] her mouth

[1:21:09] things even they shall understand the

[1:21:24] of the loving kindness of the Lord that

[1:22:35] stronger the Bible said she got weaker
[1:22:37] and weaker and she had one hope left and

[1:22:52] and on the Sabbath day Christ set her
[1:22:57] free
[1:22:57] on the Sabbath day Christ set her free
[1:23:00] Christ wants to set you free on the
[1:23:02] Sabbath day also he wants you because
[1:23:04] when you enter into his Sabbath you
[1:23:06] cease from your own works and your chin
[1:23:09] to his works and the Sabbath is the Holy
[1:23:11] Ghost when you enter into the Holy Ghost
[1:23:13] you you can only enter in one way and
