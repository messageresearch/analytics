Yes, here's my cup. Fill it up and come and thirst in my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me. Amen. Ask brother Josh Mensah if you could come and open with a word of prayer. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly gracious father, we thank you for today. Thank you for the grace of life. We thank you for the grace of grace, Lord Jesus, just to be here in your presence, Lord. It's not by our doing. It's not by our wealth. It's not by our minds, Lord. The Bible says it's by your grace, Lord Jesus. We want to commit ourselves into your hands today. Each and every single thing we do, each and every single thing we say, our thoughts, our minds, Lord Jesus, may they all be one accord. Lord Jesus, just an expectation for your word to come and just fill us today. Want to ask Lord that you bless the singing, bless the people here, our pastor who is bringing the word of God, Lord Jesus, may you just anoint him and be with him, Lord Jesus. We pray, asking that all that seeking this place be healed. May those with requests, Lord Jesus, may your anointing fill them. May you make it happen before even they open their mouths to ask, Lord Jesus. and may just come and fill this place with the holy fire, with the Holy Spirit. And may there be a revival today, Lord Jesus. And may we go back, Lord Jesus, like the men from Emos who said, "Did our hearts not bend within us as he yet speak with us today, have your way this morning and this day and this week we pray Jesus name." Amen. We can take our seats for a little while. We have a testimony from brother Joshi. Thank praise the Lord to see all you saints here out on a cold morning. I'm sure it's a lot different than Africa. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I just have a short testimony this morning. This conversation with the Lord Jesus Christ is becoming more and more real day to day. &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord on Friday nights at 7, we have a Bible study here at Higher Ground Tabernacle. On my way home from Bible study, I really wanted some chicken, so I stopped at Walmart. As I pulled up and parked, I said, "Lord, I'm gonna pick up some money from the parking lot parking lot, and then I went into Walmart and Walmart, shopped, got my chicken, &gt;&gt; and on the walk out of Walmart, on my way to my car, &gt;&gt; there's $20 on the ground that I picked up. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to thank and praise the Lord for honoring my words &gt;&gt; and bringing to pass a little extra money that paid for my dinner on Friday night. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God he's he's Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; He is our provider. He provided all our needs. &gt;&gt; He says if he shall ask anything in my name, &gt;&gt; he said, "I will do it." Amen. It doesn't matter how little you think your request is. &gt;&gt; He can provide it. Doesn't matter how big you think it is, he can still provide it. Let us stand up on our feet. Let us sing this song. When I remember what the Lord has done for me, I will never go back. Amen. How many can say that's my testimony this morning?

Amen. &gt;&gt; He's good all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what we go through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's always good. Glad to see you all this morning by his grace of God. Can we as we stand, &gt;&gt; let us turn, let us turn to Proverbs 16 &gt;&gt; and then from there we'll go to Ecclesiastes 8, &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16 and 10. And it reads, "A divine sentence is in the lips of the king. His mouth transgressth not in judgment." Ecclesiastes &gt;&gt; 8 &gt;&gt; 4-6. Where the word of a king is, there is power. And who may say unto him, "What doest thou? Whosoever keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing, and a wise man's heart discernneth both time and judgment. Because to every purpose there is time and judgment. Therefore, the misery of a man is great upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; St. John 1, please. &gt;&gt; We'll read the first uh four verses. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our heavenly father God, we come before you. We thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. Lord, you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves. with you. We pray for the service this morning. We cast down every evil imagination. We bring every thought that is not like you, Lord. We cast it down. We bring it Lord under subjection by by the power and authority of your name, Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Amen. We'd like to entitle this message having his authority. &gt;&gt; Subtopic the words of a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have been uh preaching on the throne of God. Your position in God, what God is expecting out of you. Now I like to say this by the grace of God that everybody uh has a place. You are &gt;&gt; you are positioned in God. &gt;&gt; Whether you are a housewife, manager, a journalist, journalist, &gt;&gt; president, whatever you may be, God ordained us to be. And you must understand that even in the field that God has ordained you in, he has also ordained you to be perfect. &gt;&gt; So he expects you uh with whatever gift he's given you to express Christ through that gift. &gt;&gt; Your gift has not been given to you to bury. But whatever it may be, it has been given to you to glorify God. &gt;&gt; One thing about the word of a king, as the scripture said, it is power and I think that's where we fail sometimes. As I said uhh on on last uh Wednesday. when when it comes to the Bible or the mind of God, the word is the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And you and I must understand that if if God has spoken that word, whatever word it may be, if God speaks it, it's powerful. But the Bible as it is, if it's not quickened to you, it's just another uh reading like reading another book or reading a a newspaper. Uh and that's where we are finding ourselves coming short because you must understand that the word of a king is invincible. Once the word goes out the mouth of a king, there's no way that he can retract it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It becomes law. &gt;&gt; And it it it and and and it its meaning is absolute power, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The decree whatever it may be, &gt;&gt; it's final. and unquestionable. &gt;&gt; Throw an example. If God said, "Lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." &gt;&gt; He said it &gt;&gt; and that's truth. &gt;&gt; And it's unquestionable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we must understand when we emphasize the spoken commands &gt;&gt; immediately it becomes a binding lawmak does God still do what he said he'll do? Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Now, if we can't we can say, "Oh, I got faith in God." But if you don't have faith in his word, you are deceived. You can't have faith in God and not have faith in his word. And faith is something God gives you. You don't earn it. It comes to you by grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And another thing, &gt;&gt; the Bible said that the word is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what God is? &gt;&gt; It's different from Elohim. Elohim is the self-existing one. &gt;&gt; But when we refer to God, we're saying that we're worshiping the self-existing one. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because God is the object of worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you and I don't come to worship the word, we're not worshiping God because God is the word. Does that make sense? Now, the Bible says that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made. that was made &gt;&gt; and in him was life and the life was the light of men. Every time I read that I think about character the way a man or woman ought to be after the fall of Adam. We never understood what a real man was. Everything else was perverted. until Jesus came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was the full form statue uh attribute of God. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead body. The the seals have not been opened for us to be just another church. Hallelujah. When God sent Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; and the word was open in 1963. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There were there were great mysteries. &gt;&gt; In the message in which Malachi 4 preached that we are now coming into light of. Is that all right? Remember when brother Brandham came and saw that pyramid rock that was white, he told the ministers to look on this. HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS IT? It was a word that not had not yet been revealed. Hallelujah. Is that okay? Now, I'm not preaching some doctrine. I'm preaching what brother said. And you and I must understand that this message does not stand still. It's a progressive message. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; It doesn't stop with John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; It moved on to Jesus Christ. IT DIDN'T EVEN STOP AT Jesus because Paul said, "We don't know him no longer in the flesh." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT WE KNOW HIM AFTER THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S A PROGRESSIVE revelation that's literally transforming and changing men and women INTO TRUE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. And let me say it like this. It's not what you do, but it's what he's DOING FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. I can't change myself. YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOURSELF, BUT I BELIEVE in the change. I BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD has promised me change from glory to glory. From glory to glory AND I LOOK FOR THAT CHANGE. HALLELUJAH. AND WITH THE CHANGE, THE WORD OF GOD BRINGS AUTHORITY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I SPOKE LIKE A CHILD. I ACT LIKE A CHILD. I WALK LIKE A CHILD. I DID CHILDISH THINGS. BUT WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME, I PUT AWAY THE CHILDISH. NOT THIS MORNING. THAT WHICH IS PERFECT is come. HALLELUJAH. AND IS DOING JUST WHAT HE SAID. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let me say IT LIKE THIS. MANY people may not recognize this message, but I'm going to go show you that people know that this message is right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Turn with me to Joshua 2. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joshua 2, starting at the ninth verse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, it ain't good enough just to say, I believe the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God ain't And God ain't changing you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is no way &gt;&gt; that you can feast off the mana &gt;&gt; that comes from the Holies of Holies and not be changed. Not by your power, not by your might, but by his spirit. Oh, brother said what we need to do is lay in the presence of the son. Stay with the text. Stay with the word. STAY IN YOUR BIBLE. HALLELUJAH. STAY IN THE ATMOSPHERE atmosphere &gt;&gt; of THE PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND ME? When he say LAY IN THE PRESENCE, THAT MEANS HE must be here. HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T BE IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE IF THAT SOMEONE IS NOT HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And for those of us who don't believe he's here, I can truly say you're not laying in his presence. Listen what Rahab says starting at the night verse. And she said unto the men, &gt;&gt; I know that the Lord have given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, &gt;&gt; and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We for we 10th verse for we have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what he did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side Jordan and Oz whom ye utterly destroyed. And this is what gets me. &gt;&gt; Rahab says, "We know. &gt;&gt; We have heard." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO ALL THE DENOMINATIONS, &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE HEARD, &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE SEEN &gt;&gt; THE JOSHUA OF OUR DAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And they are trembling. &gt;&gt; Because the MORE THEY TRIED TO STOP US, &gt;&gt; THE GREATER WE HAVE BECOME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; But let me say it like this. &gt;&gt; We don't need a greater number &gt;&gt; for God to be made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you are quick in your understanding. Enoch was one. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Out of millions. &gt;&gt; We are trillions. We don't know how how great the population. He was just one. And that's what the Bible said. God has never left himself without a witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And whether we enter into the message or not those who are ordained to do so, whether you like it OR NOT, GOD WILL ALWAYS FORCE THE ISSUE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, look at look at Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. Samson was ordained to to kill and destroy the Philistines. Samson Samson kind of backslid. &gt;&gt; He did backslide. AND GOD STILL SAID, "But I chose you." You hear what I'm saying? So what I'm trying to say is whatever God has ordained for you to do, WHETHER YOU BE BACKSLIDING NOW OR NOT, nobody can take your place. I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU COMFORT OR BRING comfort to you in a backsliding state. LOOK WHAT SAMSON HAD TO GO THROUGH &gt;&gt; before his eyes were open. &gt;&gt; And I'm not TALKING ABOUT HIS NATURAL EYES UNTIL HIS SPIRITUAL EYES WAS OPEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. If that's what you rather go through, then go through it. &gt;&gt; As soon as we have heard these things, Our hearts did melt. 11th verse. Neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you. For the Lord your God he is. Listen what he says. For she is saying we know for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and earth beneath. You you just think that she just got it &gt;&gt; or heard it herself just just Rahab, &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE BELIEVING IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I WONDER THIS MORNING, HOW MANY OF YOU REALLY believe it? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BROTHER?" BUT LIKE I SAID LAST WEEK, YOUR REVELATION of this message will show your worship. HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T SAY I BELIEVE THIS message and you DON'T HAVE A WORSHIP. I DIDN'T SAY PRAISE &gt;&gt; CUZ EVERYTHING can praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The trees PRAISE HIM. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU AND I, WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN WORSHIP HIM. AND IF WE WORSHIP, IT MUST BE IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I see things uh changing. &gt;&gt; The authority of the word is now living in me. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT JUST LIKE JESUS, JUST LIKE WILLIAM BRHAM, if you can't get the people to believe is of effect. HALLELUJAH. UNBELIEF CAN'T YOU won't move God at all. &gt;&gt; Unbelief you won't won't move God at all. Hallelujah. Now, if if a heathen nation or a people like Rahab &gt;&gt; because she had to get her family to believe what she believed. And understand that she didn't read it nowhere. She just heard of the miraculous things. Y'all understand me? Can I put it in in our language? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon was not just a preacher. but we heard &gt;&gt; of the miraculous things he did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we knew it wasn't a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you sisters, I'm going to tell y'all, let let me say it like this. Let me move. I I have to talk with you later. When it comes to God, &gt;&gt; God wants you to worship him. But God also know that worshiping God on the level of understanding that we have is above the Pentecostal realm. Now God don't care if you shout. God don't care if you dance. God don't even care if you speak in tongue. He doesn't care if you run. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? Everything is a order to it. AND WHEN I SAY THAT IS THE WORD is God. The word will always come first. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CAN I SAY IT LIKE THIS? IF I WAS A KING AND WHILE I WAS SPEAKING, YOU WOULD INTERRUPT MY SPEAKING. HALLELUJAH. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Esther was on the line. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But my point is, &gt;&gt; I don't want to stunt any kind of gift &gt;&gt; or anything that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But everything must come in its order. And it must come in a way that God is speaking directly. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF US GOT SOME KIND OF GIFT going on. BUT YOU AND I MUST UNDERSTAND. HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT A REBUKE. &gt;&gt; I'M I'M ENCOURAGING YOU. LET GO AND LET GOD, &gt;&gt; BUT DO IT THE WAY GOD SAYS DO IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, I want to go on now because I don't want nobody to feel like I'm, you know, on them or nothing. That's That's not right. That's not true. Don't let that thought come to your mind. We're one family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when my children or someone Amen. like like trying to play the piano. That takes time. It takes skill. But if you stay with it, you'll become a professional player. That's all I'm saying. Don't give it up. Stay with it. Hallelujah. LET GOD INSTRUCT YOU. So it be done right. Let me move on. When it comes to the word and let me tell y'all, I I can't if Let me move on. Let me move on. I get on another track. Okay. NOW, HERE WE COME BY the grace of God. &gt;&gt; And here is a woman, a prostitute &gt;&gt; who KNOWS THAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, IS THE GOD of heaven and the GOD OF EARTH. NOW, HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT? HOW MANY OF US KNOW THAT? I DIDN'T SAY IN YOUR HEAD BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW IT IN YOUR HEART HAS NO PLACE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THINK ABOUT IT. DAVID KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND WHEN GOLIATH WAS ON THE SCENE, Israel ran. But there was one man by the name of David. And even BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHERE IS MY LITTLE DAVID? Where is the people who HAVE FAITH AND KNOW THAT there's nothing, no weapon, no weapon, no weapon, NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU THAT SHOULD PROSPER." HALLELUJAH. GOD IN HIS OWN TIME WILL MAKE ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL. &gt;&gt; I believe that. It doesn't mean you're NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ROUGH TIMES. THAT'S PART OF THE JOURNEY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN A PREACHER GET CRITICIZED, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S PART OF THE JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I guarantee you, no preacher has gotten more criticized. Amen. Than William Brandham. Hallelujah. But he kept focused. Hallelujah. Listen, people of I want to say this and I want to sound like I'm proud, &gt;&gt; but I got right now, right now, &gt;&gt; churches, not just one church, churches that want me to leave here and come pastor there. &gt;&gt; So, I got a place to go, but I ain't going nowhere. &gt;&gt; I ain't going NOWHERE UNLESS GOD SHOW ME. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT GOD SHOWED ME ABOUT THIS PLACE, &gt;&gt; IT SHALL COME TO PASS, &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF WE GOT FIVE, 10, 15, IT DOESN'T MATTER ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, BUT I KNOW GOD WILL REVIVE THIS GROUP. THERE'S COMING THE POWER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S HERE ALREADY. THE PROBLEM IS WE GOT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE GOD LET you study this message for nothing. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THERE'S A TIME WHEN that uh uh WORD MUST COME TO LIFE. You keep on reading. You keep on studying. HALLELUJAH. DON'T THINK GOD HAS DESERTED YOU. THERE'S ALWAYS A TIME, &gt;&gt; THERE'S ALWAYS A PERIOD THAT GOD WILL enlighten us on what we need to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Let me turn to 1 Chronicles 29, please. &gt;&gt; We got to know more about this king. &gt;&gt; Ain't number one king. One king. Who's the king of kings? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. in 1st Chronicles 29 11:14 &gt;&gt; and it reads starting at the 11th verse, &gt;&gt; thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and THE MAJESTY. FOR ALL that is is in the heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, oh Lord. And thou shalt art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor comes of thee. Hallelujah. Th reignth over all. And in THINE HAND IS POWER and might. And in thy hand it is to make great and TO GIVE STRENGTH UNTO ALL. Did you hear that? IT'S IN HIS HAND TO MAKE GREAT AND TO GIVE STRENGTH TO ALL. NOW THEREFORE our God, we thank THEE AND PRAISE THY GLORIOUS THING. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WORSHIP. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHO GOD IS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CUZ WHEN YOU KNOW WHO GOD IS, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TO WORSHIP HIM. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy. IT'S THE TRUTH. WE DON'T WORSHIP GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ON A ON A JUSTIFIED LEVEL. HALLELUJAH. LUTHER, WE DON'T WORSHIP GOD on a westerly level. HALLELUJAH. WE DON'T WORSHIP GOD ON A PENTECOSTAL LEVEL. HALLELUJAH. OUR REVELATION IS HIGHER. Glory to God. WE WORSHIP GOD. HALLELUJAH. ON A HIGHER PLANE. IS THAT RIGHT? COME ON UP HERE, JOHN. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT IS TO COME. NOT IS NOT GOD SHOWING YOU WHAT'S TO COME. WHAT A SECURITY. WHAT A SECURITY. SECURITY. HALLELUJAH. WHAT A RESTING PLACE. HALLELUJAH. NOT TO BE STRUGGLING ON WHETHER I'M SAVED OR NOT. NOT TO BE STRUGGLING on whether I'm going TO MAKE A RAPTURE OR NOT. THE KING HAS SPOKEN AND HIS WORDS CANNOT COME BACK FORTH. IF HE CALLS ME HOLY, he calls me holy. I'M HOLY. IF HE CALLS ME SANCTIFIED, I'M SANCTIFIED. IF HE CALLS ME PERFECT, HALLELUJAH, IT'S NOT BY MY MIGHT. MY SPIRIT IS BY HIS SPIRIT, SAYS THE LORD. MY POWER, NOT BY MIGHT, BUT his spirit. HALLELUJAH. HOW CAN YOU WORSHIP GOD WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE HIS SPIRIT? Not just in truth &gt;&gt; because brother B say your doctrine could be completely right &gt;&gt; but you don't have the correct spirit and there may be a brother who a problem with with his doctrine but he's got the right spirit. Hallelujah. I wonder which one God will accept. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we have gotten to a place, hallelujah, where we are so much into ourselves &gt;&gt; and not enough into Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I didn't say Jesus, &gt;&gt; I said Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a difference. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is the anointing &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an anointing &gt;&gt; that comes with this message. &gt;&gt; And that anointing. There's an anointing of faith, NOT OF THOU FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is so real. And like I said, when you see &gt;&gt; the glory of God, when you can see he's revealed to you who he is, &gt;&gt; you you can't help but to worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the last scripture, the last little scripture to that 14th verse, &gt;&gt; he said, "But who am I? &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; And what is my people? that we SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER SO WILLINGLY AFTER THIS SORT. FOR ALL THINGS COME OF THEE, &gt;&gt; and of thine own have we given thee. You ain't got nothing. YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING. CAN I SAY IT LIKE THAT AGAIN? YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. EVERYTHING YOU HAVE is God-given. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT SAY, "I'M SMARTER THAN BROTHER BROOKS. I'M NOT JEALOUS OF YOU." HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE IS WHAT GOD GAVE YOU. HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE MONEY THAN ME. I'M NOT JEALOUS OF YOU. I DON'T WANT TO BE YOU. I'M SO GLAD TO BE ME. HALLELUJAH. WITH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS I GO THROUGH IN THIS FLESH, &gt;&gt; I never want to be you. I'm so grateful &gt;&gt; to God for who he made me, what he made me. Y'all don't know where I come from, &gt;&gt; but I'm going tell you something. I God has brought me from a mighty long way, &gt;&gt; and he ain't through with me yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Whoa, Brother Brooks, what are you saying?" &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. Whether you realize it or not, when brother Brandham was here, that was not brother Brandon speaking. That was King Theophony. That was God himself. Amen. Wrapped in flesh. You couldn't see it. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU EYES TO SEE. BLESSED IS A MAN WHOM GOD HAS US TO SEE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. What you going to DO WITH IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T BE LIKE the days of Noah, knowing the prophecy and watching Noah build the ark &gt;&gt; and you had no intentions on getting in it. YOU'RE NOT SAFE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS MESSAGE. YOU GOT TO GET INTO IT. YOU GOT TO LET HIM COME INTO YOU. OH, WE CAN SEE THE SIGN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ALL THE THINGS BROTHER BROWN HAS PROPHESIED, we see these things coming to pass, &gt;&gt; but that don't save you. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT DON'T SAVE YOU. IT'S LIKE SEEING JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS. THAT DON'T SAVE YOU. IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU ASK HIM INTO YOUR LIFE, WHEN HE BECOMES A your life, WHEN HE BECOMES YOUR SAVIOR, WHEN HE BECOMES YOUR LORD, WHEN HE BECOMES YOUR KING, THE ONLY THING THAT SAVES YOU. &gt;&gt; MILLIONS OF PEOPLE &gt;&gt; have seen that Jesus was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; THEY SAW he was THE SON OF GOD, but they never invited HIM IN. HALLELUJAH. BUT HERE THE WORD OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION, HE SAID, "I STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK AND ENEMY SHOULD OPEN UNTO ME. I WILL COME in unto him. I will supplement. You know WHAT THAT WORD SUPP MEANS? IT COMES FROM THE WORD SUPPER coming in the evening time unto me in fellowship with you. THAT MEANS HE'S NOT THERE IN HEAVEN. IN here in the king's chamber room is worshiing with you. Hallelujah. And I don't know about you. My God talks to me every day. Even when I do wrong, he doesn't get an attitude. He still speaks to me. He tells me I'm wrong. It tells me how I need to get it right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But every one of us, we hear the voice of God, &gt;&gt; but don't obey it. &gt;&gt; And the more he tries to tell you right and you refuse to listen you, the closer you become or the closer you get to the danger zone. Isaiah 55, please. &gt;&gt; Having his authority, &gt;&gt; we can't say, "Oh, we we're the we're the original." &gt;&gt; You've heard me say this before. A close friend of mine, lives in Minnesota now. &gt;&gt; Amen. He I think he's still there. He was a Baptist preacher. He came to our church one time. when we were in the other building. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Isaiah," he said, "I really believe that the Baptist is the closest to the truth than all all denominations." And excuse me, I had to laugh. And I did laugh and I said, "Friend, everybody believe that &gt;&gt; the Catholic believe they're the closest. The Baptist believe they're the closest. &gt;&gt; Pentecostals believe they're the closest. Everybody believe they're the closest. Why do you think people go to their these different denominations? &gt;&gt; Because it these denominations suits their taste. Hallelujah. Y'all understand me? Did Brother Brandon preach the message of thinking man's filter? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word of God is our filter. And whenever you try to convert anybody of another denomination, they're not going to take you through the word. They're going to take you through their filter. And if your word don't measure up to whatever doctrine they believe, they're going to call it false. Hallelujah. So you be careful. &gt;&gt; We do the same thing, don't we? Hallelujah. Let's say the appearing of Christ. &gt;&gt; Everybody don't get it at the same time. Some of us get it at a later time than others. But what we do, we'll put somebody out of it because they don't have it like you got it. &gt;&gt; Hello. Well, Mary went to the tomb first. She saw the resurrected Lord first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? Peter, James, and John, &gt;&gt; they saw him AFTER MARY. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'm saying? And then there were there were people like Thomas &gt;&gt; who saw him last &gt;&gt; the appearing &gt;&gt; the coming. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. &gt;&gt; Guess what? When Jesus came the first time, it was not Jews who saw him &gt;&gt; first. You know, you say, "Well, what do you mean?" Let me break it down so you understand me. The three kings, they were not Jews, but they HAD A REVELATION. MAYBE those who were in the the shepherd in the field. Whatever revelation they did get. Hallelujah. It wasn't as strong as the ones that the Gentiles got. Is that right? They g brought gold, frankincense, and myrr. Hallelujah. A baby. You're going to bring a baby. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stuff that even pertain to death. &gt;&gt; These saw the death resurrection. The king. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? THEY WERE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; You people. &gt;&gt; Us people. &gt;&gt; Not correct English. BUT ANYWAY, YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? &gt;&gt; GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO A GENTILE FIRST. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? IT'S JUST IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT JESUS SAID to the Jews. &gt;&gt; THIS LADY WASN'T EVEN A JEW. &gt;&gt; This woman whom God met. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ELIJAH SAID, "AMEN. FIX ME THIS FIRST. HALLELUJAH. FIX IT FIRST. You give ME FIRST AND I'LL MAKE THE first the last or the last the first. &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU GIVE ME FIRST and you'll never your oil will never run out. Your your meal WILL NEVER RUN OUT. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? AND WE SERVE THE SAME GOD. WHEN A PROPHET SPEAKS, IT'S LIKE the king's word. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE A PROPHET IS AN AMBASSADOR. HE'S A REPRESENTATIVE. HE HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD. AND THE WORDS HE SPEAK IS NOT HIS OWN WORDS. SOMEBODY HELP ME HERE. IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S WHY WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD SAY, "THE LORD, you are healed." It wasn't him making up something. IT WAS GOD SPEAKING THROUGH HIM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HE WAS SUCH A SPOKESMAN FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; God protected the gift. &gt;&gt; You couldn't just say anything to William Brandon and get away with it. Hallelujah. Many people were packed out dead in his meetings for disrespecting the king. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SEE WHAT THEY DIDN'T SEE. THEY SAW A LITTLE KUCKIAN. But behind the Kuckian was a king. &gt;&gt; Not a king, &gt;&gt; but the king. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CANNOT BREAK IT DOWN TO US. THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T JUST TREAT EACH OTHER ANY KIND OF WAY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M A KING, SON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M NEXT IN LINE. THE INHERITANCE COME TO ME AND IT COMES TO YOU. JESUS OWNS for the taking, BUT he's not going to force it on you. Make you do it in that sense. IS THAT RIGHT? HE TOLD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, I'VE GIVEN YOU THE LAND, but you got TO FIGHT FOR IT. IT'S ALREADY YOURS. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? YOUR blessings is already yours. &gt;&gt; Now, some of y'all ain't going to believe it, but I'm going to tell you where I am. Even before I came to this message, I've had God talk to me and say, "I'm going to bless you with money. Today, he did it. I needed just a coin to make a phone call back in the day. I don't know how y'all phone uh things where you had to put a dime or quarter or whatever. It all depends on whether it was local or long distance. But I didn't have no change. And I says, "Lord, I need this to call this person because it's very important. I hate to say it, but the lady or the sister who was a witness of the the the great miracle, she's deceased now. But I stand before the Lord &gt;&gt; out of the corner of of of a room. There was a light in that room. That light traveled toward me &gt;&gt; and it and it and it and and it rolled around like that &gt;&gt; and when it stopped, it was a coin. Amen. Now, you don't have to believe that, but I have to stand before God. Hallelujah. I used that coin to go call. I had to run down the streets to use the the phone. We didn't have cell phones then. Hallelujah. We had payoneses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, payoneses weren't built for emergencies because sometimes you get to the pay phone. Somebody's in the phone booth. Hallelujah. You got to wait till they get out. But at that moment, nobody was in the phone booth. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying I've seen him do it. I've seen God multiply &gt;&gt; bread and wine &gt;&gt; in communion. &gt;&gt; I got witnesses. I I can feel the unbelief. It doesn't matter. IT DOESN'T MATTER. I DON'T IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT, THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD GONNA GIVE YOU. These are little things, &gt;&gt; you know, little things. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all have witnessed &gt;&gt; here in here in this church? &gt;&gt; Snowstorms. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hurricanes, headed our way and God split them and and and it shows on the on the news. The storm splits and goes around anchoring Prayer &gt;&gt; changes things. &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T BELIEVE. We're just too scientific. WE JUST TOO KIND. WE GOT TO SEE. HALLELUJAH. GOD DIDN'T SAY SEE. HE SAID WE HAVE FAITH TO BELIEVE. And that's what we got to understand. We don't living IN A SCIENTIFIC WORLD. WE'RE IN IT BUT NOT OF IT. I I saw a sister down &gt;&gt; there in in in in in at in at in at in at in at in at in at in at in at in at in brother Chad Lamb's church, &gt;&gt; our African sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. She can't she used to come to this church and she had been married &gt;&gt; but couldn't have no children and she had been prayed for by VARIOUS MINISTERS. I'M NOT TOOTING MY HORN. I'M TELLING YOU THIS. WE PRAYED FOR HER AND SHE HAD TWINS. HALLELUJAH. AND SINCE THE TWIN, SHE GOT TWO OTHER BABIES. Guess what? WHEN I WAS DOWN THERE, SHE AND HER HUSBAND MADE IT TO ME AND SAID, "REMEMBER, BROTHER BROOKS? WHEN YOU PRAYED THAT GOD WOULD GIVE ME A BABY? HERE THEY ARE." HALLELUJAH. IT WASN'T ME. IT WAS JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU. STOP LOOKING AT MY FAULTS. PREACHING. STOP LOOKING AT MY FAILURES. &gt;&gt; If you can hear THE WORD OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THEN YOU'LL GET YOUR BLESSING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not like those disciples. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the people say, "Well, Lord, why wasn't he able to cast out demons?" No, I have the faith of God. It ain't my faith. It's his faith. I have the faith of God. I didn't ask. He gave it to me. I have to beg for it. He gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the truth. People say, "Well, if you get two or three together in my in my name, in my I'll be in the midst." But he they talking about two or three believers. &gt;&gt; Those who got the Holy Spirit in there. We got How many we got in here? But you see, it takes two to three believers. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit fil people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me read this thing now. I'm sorry. Isaiah 55:8-13. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. I'll say it like this. That's what brother Brandham said. He said, "If you don't believe, don't come up for prayer. Don't." and you don't get healed and then you blame the preacher. You didn't believe. For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not thither, &gt;&gt; but water the earth, listen to this word, but water the earth and maketh, maketh, maketh. That means God makes it. It's God God working in the midst of it. &gt;&gt; It's God who's making it happen. &gt;&gt; It brings forth bud. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CUZ WITHOUT GOD, YOU CAN'T BEAR no fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the vine &gt;&gt; and we are the branches. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PART OF THE VINE. You being a branch &gt;&gt; in the vine, &gt;&gt; you have to bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say fruit. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; You know a tree by the fruit it bear. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Don't be judging me." &gt;&gt; I'm not. I'm looking at your fruit. your fruit talking to me. &gt;&gt; So shall my word wait a minute. And but it that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater. So it doesn't it doesn't stop just at the budding of the seed. It actually the seed itself bring forth fruit. so that you can eat it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I please &gt;&gt; and it shall prosper in the things there whereto I sent it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The king has spoken. &gt;&gt; It's going to prosper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. How many of you have ever been down and you thought there was no way up and God in all of your despair when you shouldn't be despairing, &gt;&gt; he he brought you up anyway. &gt;&gt; YES. EVERY TRIAL YOU GO THROUGH IS A TEST. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN I SAY IT LIKE WORSHIP GOD. IF YOU WORSHIP GOD IN YOUR TRIAL, PRAYERS, how quick he delivers you. I've seen IT DONE. I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE BECAUSE I'M NOT THE CHANGER. BUT GOD CHANGES. IS THAT RIGHT? THE BIBLE SAID HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD ACTUALLY change time. &gt;&gt; You say he doesn't change time. He did in Joshua day. Hallelujah. Joshua say stand still and the son stood still. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHERE DID THAT TIME GO? SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. HALLELUJAH. GOD WILL WORK ON YOUR BEHALF. HE WILL WORK with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's true. I I just believe that. I've seen it. And you know, I'm I'm I'm declaring God is who he say he is. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I've suffered so much. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "These light afflictions ain't nothing. &gt;&gt; Light affliction. I can't understand it. You you got a feather on your back and you're carrying on like you got a big load. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IS that right? &gt;&gt; IN THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE SAND OF TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD SAYS, "LORD, HOW COME IT'S JUST ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS?" He said, "IT'S ONLY ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME I WAS CARRYING YOU. If you CAN'T WALK ANY LONGER, LET GOD CARRY YOU. THERE'S NO SHAME in that. &gt;&gt; No shame. &gt;&gt; You fall and you stump your toe or break your leg. &gt;&gt; Don't you want somebody to carry you? &gt;&gt; They say walk. You say, "Well, I can't walk." When you say, "I can't walk," you say, "Can you carry?" Maybe y'all don't know what I'm talking about, but I know what it is. &gt;&gt; You know, I keep looking around. I I look at the whole scope &gt;&gt; because by doing so, I can see &gt;&gt; where the word is really falling and really affecting you, you know, I'm I'm I'm a little spiritual a little bit &gt;&gt; that what he give me, I try to use it. You know, I just felt like God said to me this morning. &gt;&gt; You know, this service should be a service of rejoicing. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hammer you or beat you down. I'm trying to encourage you. I'm trying to tell you what God thinks of you and what you need to think of God. Because if you don't see God for who he is, you'll never see who you are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One thing about my children, they all look alike. &gt;&gt; Same kind of head, everything. &gt;&gt; More look more look more like my wife than me. &gt;&gt; If you you wouldn't looking at them, you wouldn't have to wonder whose child that is. &gt;&gt; That's the way it's supposed to be with God. The character of Christ is supposed to reflect so much out of us that people will not mistaken us for somebody else's child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you MUST DETERMINE WHOSE CHILD ARE YOU. &gt;&gt; I BELONG to Jesus. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let me hurry because I'm I'm I'm I'm talking too much. Forgive me. But let me move on by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen what he goes on to say. So shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the things whether to I sent it. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU'RE NOT PROSPERING, YOU NEED TO SEARCH YOURSELF. SEE WHETHER YOU BE IN the faith. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Cuz all the our suffering we go through, &gt;&gt; let's take it back back some years. &gt;&gt; None of us are being burned at the stake. &gt;&gt; You're not getting your head chopped off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Actually, Brother Brandham said that our greatest enemy in this age is easy living. That's your problem. You can't pray. You can't fast. You can't read. is because you got it too good. And sometime when you got it too good, if you are the true sons and daughters of God, he going to look at your situation and he going to say, "Hey, I need you to pray more." And you say, "Well, Lord, I'm going to get there." You keep telling him, "I'm going to get there." It's like telling one of these kids, "Go clean your room." Oh, I'm going. I'm going. And sometimes you have to get a belt &gt;&gt; and direct them to their room. &gt;&gt; Direct them to their room. You know what I'm saying? Cuz they don't get it when it's soft and easy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God has to come down and spank you. DON'T GET MAD AT GOD. YOU DID IT. YOU WON'T LISTEN. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE STUBBORN OR HARDHEADED. WHEN MY MOM used to whoop me, &gt;&gt; you know why? When she would hit me every lick, &gt;&gt; you just so hard hit. Hardhead. Hardhead. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of y'all don't know what I'm talking about. BUT LITERALLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID WRONG. AND BECAUSE OF YOUR HARDHEAD AND YOUR STUBBORNNESS, YOUR SUFFERING, &gt;&gt; you got to turn back to God. &gt;&gt; God trying to get your attention. Halle Oh, come on, somebody. Oh, I know I'm hitting the right area now. Hallelujah. God trying to get your attention. HE WAS CHASING THOSE WHOM HE LOVES. IT'S A PROOF that he loves you. It's so late in the evening now. People, oh, I got to go do I mean, you you're working the scripture called to the wedding supper &gt;&gt; and now you got to go find You you you busy doing everything else. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Have mercy, Jesus. Yeah. Let's move on. Let me read this. Finish up this. &gt;&gt; I know it's a little bit after 12, but it's okay. For ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of THE FIELD SHALL CLAP THEIR HANDS. You hear what I'm saying? AND YOU GET PEOPLE IN CHURCH, EVERYBODY CLAPPING their hands, and you WON'T EVEN MOVE YOUR HAND. &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHETHER WHAT YOUR REVELATION IS. WHO ARE YOU WORSHIPING? Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? HE SAID, "TREES, WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU ARE A TREE. AND IF YOU GOT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU ARE A TREE OF LIFE." Instead of thorns shall come up the fire far fire tree fur tree and instead of brier shall come up the merl tree. &gt;&gt; So if you got thorns and you got briars. Amen. Somehow you in the wrong atmosphere. Hallelujah. Cuz stickers come by way of no moisture. You haven't been in the spirit of the Holy Spirit for a long time. The presence of the Holy Spirit a long time. You love the Lord. Let me finish this now. All right. And it shall be to the Lord for a name, an everlasting sign that shall not be cut out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What are you saying? I'm a sign. &gt;&gt; And what sign am I? &gt;&gt; I'm a blessed sign. &gt;&gt; So are you. &gt;&gt; Blessed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I told you that brother bought me that car. &gt;&gt; He bought it, &gt;&gt; FINISHED IT OFF JUST LIKE HE said he would. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying when you trust God AND PEOPLE I DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM FOR A NEW CAR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WAS FIXING UP MY MY OLD one over and over AND OVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD PUT ON THAT brother's heart. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I almost want to cut it off. But 36,000 &gt;&gt; one shot. Y'all understand? Because y'all heard the testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just saying &gt;&gt; I know he loves me &gt;&gt; and I know he loves the Lord. Come on. Cuz if you love the Lord, that's the only thing. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that'll make you do THAT IS WHEN YOU LOVE THE LORD AND YOU CAN HEAR HIS VOICE. &gt;&gt; I know that's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all heard my testimony when God said, "Give that give that brother $50." I said, "Lord," I said, "Lord, that's all I have." &gt;&gt; And God said, "But that's all I ask you for." &gt;&gt; And from that $50, he gave me 500 in the mail by a sister I DIDN'T KNOW AND STILL DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying that's how he works with me. And I believe I'm no I'm no special person. God will do the same for you. If you let go and let God, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm serving a God of prosperity both spiritually and naturally. I'm telling you, but he needs somebody to trust. &gt;&gt; We we always quote the woman, you know, in Elijah, but that woman had to put trust in the words that Elijah spoke. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell y'all something. CAN I SAY IT LIKE THIS? WHEN I GO BEFORE GOD, &gt;&gt; I SAY, LORD, you promise. &gt;&gt; God loves that. He loves it. When you take his word and you come before him and say, "But you promise, Lord." And when you operate like that, &gt;&gt; God will. Now you got the problem is with us. If you got a if you got a problem with patience, &gt;&gt; he going to have you wait a little bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; It's in you to you. It's in you to wait. &gt;&gt; If you were in Abraham, you can wait 25 years. Abraham, &gt;&gt; but it's in you to wait. Now, I'm enjoying JESUS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT LAUGHING AT NOBODY. I'm enjoying the anointing that I feel right now is there's a joy in my soul and that's what I'm enjoying. So, let me move on because I &gt;&gt; don't be r don't be in a hurry to rush. It's cold out there. &gt;&gt; For the Lord most high is terrible for he is a great king over all the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's I uh Psalms 47. Did I say &gt;&gt; Psalm 47? I'm sorry. 1-9. I I I started and did I'm going to start with one. Clap your hands all ye people. &gt;&gt; Shout unto God with a voice of triumph. &gt;&gt; Now we're coming here. Oh, we coming to see God. Everybody's so so sad. Your head your head hung down and you don't even you don't even have a phone in your hand. Usually you have an excuse, &gt;&gt; but you don't even have a phone in your head. &gt;&gt; The devil, Mhm. I got him. Just exactly where I want it. &gt;&gt; Cuz you ain't got no strength cuz the joy of the Lord is your strength. Hallelujah. Y'all don't know how to encourage yourself in the Lord. Maybe I'm THE ONLY ONE. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CAN'T GET NOBODY TO WORSHIP WITH YOU, PUT SOME MUSIC IN THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You know, YOU STOMP THE DEVIL a little bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got to DO SOMETHING. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING in motion &gt;&gt; in order to get something. &gt;&gt; Don't think it's for not. &gt;&gt; Don't think it's for not. Don't think it's for nothing. &gt;&gt; I can't get that English pronunciation. N &gt;&gt; anyhow, when we see by the grace of God, I was told I was told, and I know I'm going off on this, but I was told that the flutter of a butterfly &gt;&gt; wings &gt;&gt; can start a tornado, &gt;&gt; a hurricane, excuse me, a hurricane. I don't know how they came up with that, &gt;&gt; but it must be a special butterfly. &gt;&gt; And if that be true, think about it. One little motion &gt;&gt; rains on a horrific storm. So let me say it like this. Your prayers &gt;&gt; are not just a thdimensional prayer. And though Satan can hinder you, your prayer, he can't stop it. &gt;&gt; Daniel, &gt;&gt; you prayed. It's been 21 days. But we heard you the first time you prayed. Don't think God can't hear you. That if you think God don't hear you, God hears you. And uh so understand Satan may be holding it, but he can't stop it. &gt;&gt; He just tried to bring you closer, closer, closer. You trust me and I'll trust you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The voice of triumph. I love that. I love that because well, I can truly say &gt;&gt; our song service has gotten better when it comes to the voice. And so therefore we growing in that somehow the praises of God is becoming more heartfelt than just traditional for the Lord most high is terrible. That means powerful. He is a great king over all the earth. He shall subdue the people under us. Hello. He shall subdue the people under us. &gt;&gt; And the nations under our feet. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT YESTERDAY. &gt;&gt; This is today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all, I I tell you another testimony. &gt;&gt; I wasn't even in this message when I was a Christian. you know, and and and and and I was the comproller, the head of the uh accounting department &gt;&gt; working working for the uh Ramada in I was a head of the hotel as well as the restaurant. But because of who I was, I had a lot of opposition. And Satan worked some things that I didn't see him working. &gt;&gt; But I made a com comment that was taken back to the the owner of the hotel. &gt;&gt; He was making changes in the restaurant. And I thought that that his changes would cause a problem with certain uh um kind of people. &gt;&gt; So anyway, to make a long story short, he got the message. He came to my job. He literally cursed me out. I mean there was nothing I could say to defend myself because what I said had been twisted. &gt;&gt; God is my witness. Three months, four months. I don't know how long it had been. And that was a time when I didn't know to pray for people. See, when people when people offend you, you you don't understand they're in danger zones. And if you don't pray for them, God has a way of dealing with them. &gt;&gt; I didn't know that that time because I loved this man. I loved him. He was this man saw me when I was just out of college, you know, trying to find my way out through life. I was riding a little beat up car and and he saw my car out there and said, "Who car is this &gt;&gt; in front of my hotel?" Cuz it was one of those kind of hotels. He said, "Oh, no, no, no, no. You can't work here and park that kind of car in front of my hotel." &gt;&gt; You know what that man did? Now, this may not sound like a lot of money to you, but in that in that time, that man gave me a $30,000 raise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was able to buy my first house and my first new car. So, I really was attached to this man. He never asked me for nothing. &gt;&gt; Back in the day when my brain was a little more sharper, I would watch them come and fix the computers. &gt;&gt; And I saved that man lots of money. I saved him lots of money cuz when the computer would go down, I would go in and redo it. Reboot it, re whatever. And so what I'm what I'm saying is &gt;&gt; three months or four months after that the man fell to a stroke, &gt;&gt; lost his whole business and he died. You said, "Brother Brooks, that had nothing to do with you." Maybe, &gt;&gt; but I think it did. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that's the way it is with every son and daughter of God. I'm not weak. I'm careful. &gt;&gt; Y'all heard what I said. &gt;&gt; I said I'm not weak. I'm careful. &gt;&gt; Because you don't never know who is who. And what God is doing with people. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? And I said all of that and that's way off my subject, &gt;&gt; but I said that to uh bring us to this point. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read another quote and then I'll let you go. &gt;&gt; I'm jumping here a little bit, but that's okay. You know, when I see by the grace of God an ambassador because that's what we are. Paul said we are the ambassadors of Christ. &gt;&gt; We have no word of our own. But the word that we have is authority. And an ambassador is the highest ranking diplomat or representing representing their government in a foreign country. or to an international organization &gt;&gt; acting as the official messenger &gt;&gt; and representative for their nation's history. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, what do you mean, Brother Bruce?" &gt;&gt; You are and you got to believe this. &gt;&gt; But you see, if you don't read your word, I'm trying to tell you. The Bible said, "Let this mind be in you &gt;&gt; that was also in Christ Jesus." Stop thinking about what you used to be. &gt;&gt; You're no longer what you used to be. And the devil keep coming to your mind. This is trying to identify you with the past. But don't you believe the Bible said if you if you uh uh confess with your mouth and believe with with your heart, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, you pass from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Then your old man is dead. I'm sorry that we have to carry this old dead flesh around with us. He's always on us. We we basically stuck to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BUT PAUL SAID, "KILL HIM. DON'T SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, the devil say, "Oh, remember when?" No, no, no, no, no. You talking to the wrong man. &gt;&gt; I know remember when. HELLO. DON'T REMEMBER WHEN. You either NEW CREATURE OR YOU'RE NOT. AND IF YOU'RE NOT A NEW CREATURE, become one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look what Brother Brham says here. for him will I accept &gt;&gt; message uh 52 I don't I don't have the paragraph but he said just as if the president of the United States &gt;&gt; would make me an ambassador to Germany my words then in Germany would be just exactly what the president told me to say if If I said them what he told me to say, then everything that's in the United States is behind them words. &gt;&gt; So, let me say it like this. Everything in heaven and in earth is behind the word. &gt;&gt; You are encompassed about &gt;&gt; with so great a cloud of witnesses. You know, I I want to say amen to those of you who have fallen like Samson. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; GET UP. REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE YOU SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT ATMOSPHERE, BUT IT AIN'T ALL OVER YET. God is not through WITH YOU. OH, I'VE DONE THIS. I'VE DONE THAT. WHAT? THE BLOOD OF JESUS COVERS IT ALL. &gt;&gt; HE PAID YOUR DEBT. &gt;&gt; HE PAID MY DEBT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WANT TO SEE YOU IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. But you don't mind the devil using your body. You he one or the other. It's either GOD USING YOU OR THE DEVIL USING YOU. HALLELUJAH. AND EVERYTHING GOD WANTS FROM YOU, THE DEVIL WANTS from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But most of the time, THE DEVIL GETS IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SUPPOSED to be giving to God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY HE SAID, "CHOOSE YOU THIS DAY. Who you going to serve? CHOOSE THE SIDE YOU GO ON, WHO YOU'RE GOING TO STAND WITH." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You know, you got people I'm closing cuz I keep going. &gt;&gt; You got people in the message. You know, you got this side, oh, you don't quote brother enough. And this side say you quote him too much. &gt;&gt; And then there's another one say, "Oh, you say brother Brandham names too much." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Man, if I was pleasing you, &gt;&gt; I'd be one confused person. &gt;&gt; But you got to understand, a preacher has to be led by the Holy Spirit. And let me say it like this. If you're in this day questioning the position William Brandham had, you need to get on your knees and say, "Lord, show me. reveal to me &gt;&gt; who Malachi 4 is, &gt;&gt; who William Brandham is, BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY understand the authority of the message. THE AUTHORITY OF THE MESSAGE is you don't have a word to say. &gt;&gt; You don't have an opinion on this. That's why we got so many crazies. &gt;&gt; So many crazies. Every man want to have a kingdom. There ain't one kingdom and that's the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. William Brandom worked for that kingdom. &gt;&gt; I'm working for that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I don't believe everything brother Brandham said. The bride does. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's all I can tell you. And those things that seem to be controversial, &gt;&gt; God normally reveals it to them &gt;&gt; or they don't they don't bother with it. They just move on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I mean, there's words in in the English uh vocabulary. If you would speak it, &gt;&gt; I would have no idea what you &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But then God brings it down simple in a simple way. Isaiah said even a fool won't air. &gt;&gt; So a man who don't believe that this message is right. Does that make him a fool or worse? &gt;&gt; No. I let them answer that question. &gt;&gt; You know it's like looking at the boat that Noah built and there was Noah. Let me examine this thing. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's going to flow. &gt;&gt; But the boat was built by God. &gt;&gt; No, it was just a hands that God used. Y'all understand me? Hallelujah. This ark is built by God. William Brand was God's instrument. He just used Hallelujah. And so you understand you. You are the the the instruments God want to use. &gt;&gt; Is it hard? &gt;&gt; It better be &gt;&gt; because you've chosen the harder way. &gt;&gt; When things come too easy, you are you need to watch it. Every time you think it's good, so sweet, here come that little grasshopper. He going to eat you. Eat whatever you done built up. Hallelujah. You love the Lord. Be encouraged. Don't Don't let the devil put you down and got you on his feet. &gt;&gt; You ain't the only one that needs to pay bills. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something. I've been homeless. I've been homeless. &gt;&gt; But God, I survived. &gt;&gt; When my mother died, there was nobody that wanted to take me in. not even my family. And if I didn't have a a college to go to, I would have been out there. Thank God to the scholarship that I had. Amen. I was able to go to Colorado and I had a living place and go to school and be paid. &gt;&gt; Say, "My God ain't a provider." &gt;&gt; Hey, somebody. Y'all don't know what I'm talking about, but I know what I'm talking about. God will always supply your need. &gt;&gt; You trust God. Trust God. Trust God. Trust God. You know, my friend, my closest friend, I'm I'm trying to sit down now and I want some I want come up with some singing, brother. Where where the song leader at? We going to worship this morning. And everybody that got to go, you can go. &gt;&gt; But we going to sing some victory songs and we going to worship &gt;&gt; and uh we going to let God know how much we appreciate him. Hallelujah. But my closest friend, um, we've been friends ever since fifth grade. He's in the message. &gt;&gt; His family is, I mean, you know, some of them not living right like mine. But one thing for certain, this this friend of mine, we never had an argument, a fall out. &gt;&gt; The one time I told him, I saw him sassy his mother. I saw my friend sassy his mother and I told him if you going to remain my friend don't let me ever hear you sassy your mom and as far as I know of he never did it again. Oh, I don't believe in that. I don't care if they let you know you don't sassy mama and you don't sassy daddy. Young, that ain't cute. That's ugly. &gt;&gt; That's demonic. &gt;&gt; And you spare the rod, spoil the child. &gt;&gt; Let me tell y'all. Let me tell y'all something. My mother used to tell me. If you don't whip that child, when it grows up, it's going to whip you. We see these babies &gt;&gt; hitting their parents think, "Oh, they too little to think." What? &gt;&gt; Take that pamper down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to beat it to death. &gt;&gt; But you got to let that child know this is not acceptable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all, I'm telling y'all, some of these little kids are cursing. &gt;&gt; What? Brothers, &gt;&gt; no. Nobody told me. I heard it myself. &gt;&gt; And I know they were so terrified. They thought I was going to tell you. &gt;&gt; But my point is, no, no, no. You knew you were wrong. You make right. &gt;&gt; Parents can't keep up with all their kids. Let me let me stop. Let me stop. But my point is, my point is people of God, if they you know you love your children, &gt;&gt; spank your children &gt;&gt; and give them a good hug. &gt;&gt; Let them know how much you love them afterwards. &gt;&gt; You might have them confused for a bit, but as they grow up and mature, they're going to understand what you did was the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't care how cute. No, no, no. You ain't cute. &gt;&gt; My children might say I whooped them too much. Maybe I did. I don't know. I always tell them I don't remember. But you know after learning this message I I because before the message I did whip him in anger. &gt;&gt; Anybody whip you? Have you ever done it? Oh yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'mma stop. &gt;&gt; But everyone every one of my kids as they grown up, I've asked them if there's anything in your lives that I've done wrong that I need to apologize. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you every one of my children. &gt;&gt; I have apologized because sometime parents we think we're right when we're wrong. And ain't nothing wrong with confessing to your children and asking for their forgiveness because really as long as they got that there, they can't go any further. You hindering them from moving on in God. &gt;&gt; So I tell my children, "Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you whip me in anger?" "Yeah, I whipped you in anger." And I found out that I was wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. One more thing. &gt;&gt; I'll just say this. By the gra I'm walking off. &gt;&gt; Teenagers &gt;&gt; are very difficult to deal with. &gt;&gt; Now that I better understand them, I would I would handle my children different. But one of my boys as he grew up, &gt;&gt; you know how they get in your face? One of my boys got in my faith &gt;&gt; and before I knew it, I had him like this. &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian, &gt;&gt; but he punched the wrong button. And I don't know where the strength came from, but I grabbed him and I lift him above my head like that. I ain't gonna tell you the rest. &gt;&gt; But by God's grace, I repented &gt;&gt; and asked the Lord to forgive me. &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you something. I disrespect from children. I just can't handle that. Not from my children, nobody else. You love the Lord. Y'all teach these kids right. I'm telling you words of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Come on. Give us the songs, brother. We going to praise the Lord. For those who want to praise the Lord, if there anybody here that needs prayer, The power of God is in the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, we thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, we have a few important announcements to make after we're done singing. So, if you can stay, hang back so we can announce it. We can stand up on our feet and sing this song. When the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go maring in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that number.

So, Jehovah Rafa, he can heal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um so we want to make an announcement regarding the building contributions. &gt;&gt; So it's just a brief financial report for um everything that happened in 2025. &gt;&gt; Um I'm starting I'll start out with All right. Yeah. Um, so we started collecting our building contributions in 2024 towards the end of that year. &gt;&gt; And 2024 we collected a total of $10,100. That was in in three three months. That's how much we're able to collect in 2024 by the end of the year. Then the whole of 2025 &gt;&gt; we collected a total of 6,750 &gt;&gt; which was um very little compared to what we were expecting to to be collecting &gt;&gt; because based on our projections we're supposed to collect about $5,000 every month. So every month for the six months, we were estimating to collect $30,000. $10050. So we are very very much way below our expectations and our projections. Then this year 2026 to date we've collected $300 $350 which is just this month of January because remember January is a building contribution collection month. Yeah. So we are very much below our uh we are very much below our expectation. But like we agreed we'll just keep on collecting. However much we go that snail pace just as much as we contribute that's how much we going to proceed with. &gt;&gt; So to date starting from since October 2024 we have collected $17,200. So that's how much we have um in our church building contribution funds. &gt;&gt; So just to reiterate, we asked uh we all agreed that each and every working person is supposed to be able to pay at least $100. or more if the Lord put it puts it on your heart. But again, if you can make it, you can only contribute however much you can you can. So with that said, we're going to keep on collecting that contribution &gt;&gt; until we get to a point in time where we can do something with the accumulated funds. My my apology uh we we we had thought to move the church &gt;&gt; to try to connect with Iowa City's church as well, &gt;&gt; but that's off the table right now. &gt;&gt; The reason being is because it would we would leave too many people behind. will leave people here. Uh so we spoke with Iowa City. We're going to remain here, &gt;&gt; but while we are here, we're still looking. I've got a realtor who's actually helping me. &gt;&gt; Almost found a building. It was a hundred,000 building which would have been perfect for us. &gt;&gt; But what happened is somebody beat me to it. &gt;&gt; So if you guys want to do something, you want to move forward. It's going to take your help. And even if you don't have money to give, &gt;&gt; pray that God will put on somebody else's heart and bless somebody else. It doesn't have to, you know, some of y'all are just prayers. If you can pray, &gt;&gt; God will do it, &gt;&gt; you know, but we should be further up the road &gt;&gt; than we are. &gt;&gt; And this is about you and about the people of God because I believe if we get a bigger building and a and a place that seem a little more safer, &gt;&gt; God will bless because in the winter time it is quite dangerous to be out there sometimes in the dark. &gt;&gt; Um, but we want to do better &gt;&gt; and we want a bigger place, but it all depends on what you all want. And so I really appreciate our brother Sam and all the efforts that he's doing to get us to to give. But like I said, It's whatever you guys want. &gt;&gt; You know, everybody was talking about buying property and building a building on this and that, &gt;&gt; but you know, that takes money &gt;&gt; and we'll have to do better than that. There's not something that we can't do. It all depends on whether you want to do it because we do have it. We can do it. Everything causes for a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; The greater the sacrifice, the greater the blessing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we haven't given up on the plans to move out of here. &gt;&gt; And remember this is for all of us. &gt;&gt; So the burden is not just on the pastor or on the church leadership. Just to uh say this again what we say before. If you come across a property or a place that you believe is suitable, please uh come up forward and give us that idea so we can assess it. Amen. Because we want to leave out of here. Usually when it rains, we usually get water falling in here. Amen. With that said, we just want to appreciate and thank each and everyone who was able to contribute. &gt;&gt; Let's just clap hands for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray that the Lord may add blessings and reward you for the giving that you gave. Then next um it's just a what everything that happened in 2025 regarding offerings. The total offerings that we collected in the year of 2025 &gt;&gt; was $25,28864. That's how much we collected in offering &gt;&gt; and our rent every month without the utilities and other stuff. &gt;&gt; Our rent was um monthly rent is $1,66420. &gt;&gt; So the whole of 2025 our rent was 19,970. And the surplus of the offering from the rent is $5,300 $31824. &gt;&gt; And with this, that's where uh the bills and utilities come from. um helping out with the Sunday school things that happen for your kids and all the everything that needs to be funding from church is supposed to be from that difference and also when we have visiting ministers come in it is the offering that's supposed it is the offering that's supposed to pay for their accommodation traveling and whatever is needed. in there. &gt;&gt; So just to summarize &gt;&gt; that that diff that amount was not enough to cover all that. &gt;&gt; So basically our collection and how much we we spent was in the red. Um I mentioned this before, but I'd like to reiterate it again. So every difference that's not that the church couldn't cover &gt;&gt; is the pastor who did. &gt;&gt; So every expense that we're not able to meet the pastor uses his own money. &gt;&gt; But it is not supposed to be like that. We are supposed to be self sustaining. And we are supposed to be in surplus. &gt;&gt; So just look at those figures and keep that in your mind. &gt;&gt; We are operating in the red deficit and that's not a good thing. &gt;&gt; But that's the totals for 2025 of &gt;&gt; how much we were able to collect and some of the money that we spent. so as we're getting into 2026. I pray the Lord will put it on our heart so we can financially do better. &gt;&gt; And when someone says put your money where your mouth is. So if you say we want to move out of this building as soon as possible, &gt;&gt; may your giving reflect what you were saying. Amen. Let's clap our hands ourselves for the offerings and all the giving we have done. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's it for the building contribution and the offerings. And um just a reminder, we have the pastor's birthday celebration. going to be next week on Sunday, &gt;&gt; February the the 1st. &gt;&gt; And um we're going to put the address in the church group &gt;&gt; so that people can so you can get it. &gt;&gt; Um I believe it's a place where we had other two weddings, right? &gt;&gt; It's the event center where we had the wedding for sister Cecil and Sister Naomi. So, that's the place where we'll be at. &gt;&gt; And uh the time we are supposed to be there, we supposed to be there from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. &gt;&gt; And please note, we need to be out by 5 because that's how long the building has been reserved for. So, please 2:00 p.m. clock time, &gt;&gt; not 2 p.m. uh African time. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh the sooner we in, the sooner we out and it's February the 1st. I believe that's all the announcement I have for today. I don't think I forgot anything today. bones &gt;&gt; right now. They said that the cancer has moved from his prostrate into his bones. &gt;&gt; So, you know, he's got a lovely wife, &gt;&gt; and he he has two more children than I have. He has they have 10. &gt;&gt; So, they need him. &gt;&gt; And um he's been closer to me than my natural brother or sisters. We desire your prayers. &gt;&gt; Even though, you know, he's heavy on my heart, I I said unto the Lord, I'm not interested in, you know, you prolonging his life. &gt;&gt; He just turned 73 months ago. &gt;&gt; I just want to make sure he's ready, you know, as a believer. I believe God's going to raise him up. &gt;&gt; He told me today that all of his vitals came back looking good. &gt;&gt; But it is a strain. They have a a restaurant and he played a great part in keeping it going. &gt;&gt; If you don't remember his name, just say brother Brooks Fred. We appreciate you. Thank you. Amen. We have come to the end of our service. Are we still happy to be in the house of the Lord this Sunday afternoon? Just shake around in your neighbor's hand and say, "Are you still happy?" &gt;&gt; I see some silent faces. I will bless thee, oh Lord, with a heart of thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh Lord. I will bless thee, oh Lord. Lord, I will bless thee, oh Lord, with the heart of thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh Lord, with my hands, with my hands lifted up, and with my mouth filled with the With the heart of thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh Lord. So I will bless thee, oh Lord. Oh, I will bless thee, oh Lord. With the heart of thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh Lord. So I will bless. Oh, I will bless thee. Well, down.
