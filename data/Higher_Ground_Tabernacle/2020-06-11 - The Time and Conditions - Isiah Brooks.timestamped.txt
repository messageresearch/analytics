[39:35] to war and a time of peace what prophet
[39:40] have he that worketh in the we're we're
[39:44] in elated I have seen the travail which
[39:47] God has given to the sons of men to be
[39:50] exercised in it we have made everything
[39:54] beautiful yeah
[39:59] also he have set the world in their
[40:02] hearts so that no man can find out the
[40:05] work that God make it from the beginning
[40:08] to the end I know that there is no good
[40:11] in them but for a man to rejoice and to
[40:14] do good in his life and also that every
[40:18] man should eat and drink and enjoy the
[40:21] good of all his labor it is a gift of
[40:24] God I know that whatsoever God do it it
[40:28] shall be forever nothing can be put to
[40:31] it nor anything taken from it and God do
[40:34] it there that man should fear before him
[40:37] that which have been is now that which
[40:40] is to be have already been and God
[40:43] required that we father God we come
[40:49] before you we thank you for your grace
[40:51] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[40:54] for being so good to us Lord you have
[40:57] been better to us and we have been to
[41:00] ourselves and father
[41:01] we know Lord God that we are in your
[41:06] care you the caretaker Lord your the
[41:10] provider you our shelter you are all in
[41:16] all and we thank you tonight for being
[41:18] so good to us
[41:19] bless the service and bless those who
[41:21] are listening by way of YouTube or the
[41:25] radio however we just pray Lord that you
[41:27] bless them we thank you God for our
[41:31] sister Joanne and others who are
[41:33] listening we pray father that you
[41:35] continue to bless her house and our
[41:37] household pray Lord God for my son out
[41:41] in California
[41:42] my son there in Ohio different ones Lord
[41:46] that are listening we pray father god
[41:48] that the word will find place in their
[41:50] hearts and bring forth a hundredfold we
[41:54] ask these things in Jesus Christ's name
[41:56] we pray you may be seated I I think
[42:08] about the Lord and basically all that
[42:11] God has done for me and I become
[42:15] overwhelmed because I realized that it
[42:22] is God who is doing everything I am so
[42:26] how can I say it at a time when the
[42:29] world is in chaos I have such a peace
[42:32] that I know that only God could have
[42:34] given and you know I think about how so
[42:38] many people are in turmoil fear is seen
[42:41] to overtake them but you and I who are
[42:45] in this place of safety
[42:50] we only got here because God chose us
[42:54] and when when I think about this Bible
[42:59] and how the Bible is so simple if you
[43:02] really know the author of the Bible he
[43:06] is not one that will complicate anything
[43:09] but he does he says in his word that the
[43:13] only way that you can understand this
[43:15] book you must have his spirit this book
[43:18] was written in such a way to to those
[43:21] who are humble and meek those who are
[43:23] are willing to die to themselves God
[43:28] makes it so simple and so plain I think
[43:32] that
[43:33] we have seen how basically education
[43:37] have destroyed the effects of the Bible
[43:41] traditions and all of these things but
[43:43] God is God and I know one thing that if
[43:48] I am born of him I don't have to worry
[43:51] about living like him because his Spirit
[43:55] conquers everything and we know that in
[43:58] God there is no failure and there is no
[44:03] fear but even so the Bible tells us that
[44:07] it's a it's not how can I say it it's
[44:10] not a way that man can find out himself
[44:13] it's not something that you can you
[44:16] can't put God in science because God is
[44:19] the creator of science you can't put him
[44:23] in a place in your mind of reasoning and
[44:26] you know things of that nature
[44:28] because God in order to understand him
[44:31] he reveals himself he gives himself to
[44:35] you you can't really find him because
[44:38] none of us within ourselves looked for
[44:41] him and if we think that we looked for
[44:45] God it's only because God put it in you
[44:47] to look for him because he knew that if
[44:50] you would look for him in the proper
[44:53] time you would find him we're at a time
[44:57] that we are in what we call a faith
[45:00] generation a generation where a faith is
[45:08] considered ignorance but everybody has a
[45:13] measure of faith but the kind of faith
[45:17] I'm talking about tonight is the faith
[45:19] that God gives you his own thing
[45:23] hallelujah because when you receive the
[45:26] faith of God all things are possible we
[45:33] understand by God's grace that no flesh
[45:36] since the fog has been able to produce a
[45:39] perfect man in all of their efforts men
[45:45] has a tendency to pay
[45:47] first of all we were born failures and
[45:50] so therefore it is what it is but the
[45:54] Bible tells us that in that while we
[45:56] were yet sinners Christ died for us he
[46:00] knew us even when we didn't know
[46:03] ourselves
[46:04] you can go throughout all the patriarchs
[46:07] in and all of the prophets and
[46:09] everything else and you find out that
[46:11] somewhere in their lives they messed up
[46:14] I think the closest one a man that ever
[46:18] walked like Jesus Christ was was Joseph
[46:23] himself because there was really no
[46:25] marks against him but if you search the
[46:28] scripture you'll find that that Joseph
[46:31] made a little mistake and he lied to the
[46:35] Pharaoh and he told the Pharaoh that his
[46:39] people were her shepherd herdsmen of
[46:43] cattle instead of shepherds of sheep
[46:45] because in order in Egypt to be a sheep
[46:51] a shepherd was an embarrassment it was
[46:56] low life so if I have been in Egypt I
[47:00] would have been considered low life
[47:03] because I'm a shepherd and you see that
[47:07] means that a true preacher even in this
[47:11] world today is considered ignorant you
[47:16] would believe such a thing as Jesus
[47:19] Christ and him raising from the dead and
[47:22] bringing life to you absolutely you
[47:26] believe that in this man dwelt the
[47:29] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[47:31] you you believe that and you believe
[47:34] that this Bible is real well I want to
[47:39] say I'm beyond belief I'm a witness
[47:43] hey man because when you become a
[47:45] witness it's that you've been there
[47:48] you've done that amen and there's a time
[47:53] for everything
[47:54] you know God created everything and that
[47:57] scripture says there's a beginning and
[47:59] there's a ending there's a bill
[48:01] these are coming down and nothing really
[48:03] change because even the spirits that
[48:07] that Michael fought in the beginning
[48:10] this year the same and they're doing the
[48:13] same thing now as they did then that's
[48:18] why the Bible says that we are not
[48:20] ignorant of Satan's devices Satan comes
[48:24] to kill steal and destroy but Jesus
[48:28] comes to give us life and that we might
[48:31] have it more abundantly see the
[48:34] conditions in which we're living now is
[48:36] nothing new because the Bible said there
[48:39] is no new thing under the Sun what
[48:41] people are doing now is not new they've
[48:44] done it before and because they did they
[48:48] done it before God also brought his
[48:51] judge has brought his judgment before we
[48:54] look at conditions and the Bible says as
[48:56] it was in the days of Noah answer was in
[48:58] the days of Sodom and we look at these
[49:00] things and we said oh my god can't get
[49:02] any worse well I said like this if the
[49:06] fire of Babylon or Nebuchadnezzar
[49:10] however you want to put it is to be
[49:12] heated up seven times harder that means
[49:15] the demonic power is to be multiplied as
[49:19] well you and I understand that out of
[49:22] the year river Euphrates I believe it's
[49:24] two hundred million Oh demons came out
[49:30] and we've seen with our own eyes what
[49:34] they did and what they have done and
[49:36] what they're going to do because the
[49:39] Bible tells us that these demons that
[49:42] were loosed out of you the river
[49:44] Euphrates are the same demons that Noah
[49:47] had to work with hallelujah and the
[49:52] Bible tells us that these demons
[49:54] influenced the world so much that only
[49:57] eight souls were saved
[49:59] not including Enoch because in the Enoch
[50:02] era only one so was he hallelujah and
[50:07] thank God that we realized amen who
[50:11] built the pyramids
[50:12] when scientist
[50:14] don't have no idea of who built it we
[50:18] know because without a vision the people
[50:20] perish and houses of years before the
[50:25] flood came God had already pronounced by
[50:30] the building of a pyramid what this age
[50:34] was going to produce it was going to
[50:37] produce a church age that would
[50:39] literally reject the capstone hallelujah
[50:44] but then you saw the capstone then you
[50:48] said I saw a stone hewn of the mountain
[50:52] rolling down to Babylon destroying all
[50:56] the works of the devil
[50:58] hallelujah and I'm so glad tonight to
[51:01] know that we're living in the same time
[51:03] and conditions and because of it we can
[51:07] expect God to do something hallelujah
[51:12] something great within the people you
[51:14] understand me so we understand that if
[51:17] we're living in the days of Sodom and
[51:21] Gomorrah
[51:21] there must be an Abraham hallelujah and
[51:26] this Abraham he's no longer here
[51:29] himself but he brought a seed but
[51:32] understand this the seed of Abraham is
[51:35] not by science is not by flesh
[51:39] hallelujah is that right is not by the
[51:41] will of man but is by the promise of God
[51:45] Abraham the Bible said staggered not at
[51:48] the promise of God if you read Romans
[51:50] the fourth chapter you'll find out that
[51:53] Abraham received his circumcision before
[51:56] he was circumcised the sign of
[51:59] circumcision so I'm trying to encourage
[52:01] you this morning or tonight don't worry
[52:03] if God has chosen you to be bride he'll
[52:07] give you the sign of circumcision
[52:09] what was it abraham believed god
[52:12] hallelujah
[52:13] he even though the works had not yet
[52:16] been made manifest he believed God and
[52:19] God said because you believe me of him
[52:21] I'm counting down as righteousness
[52:24] hallelujah and that's how it is with the
[52:26] of this message if you truly believe it
[52:29] with all of your heart God is already
[52:33] accounted the seal done hallelujah
[52:37] you're gonna go through tests you're
[52:40] gonna go through trials hallelujah but
[52:43] at the end of the day you're gonna
[52:46] recognize God's sacrifice in the way God
[52:51] recognized it because Abraham tried to
[52:54] offer up Isaac as a sacrifice and God
[52:57] says not so Abraham but I know that you
[53:00] love me because you were willing not
[53:02] only give your own life but the very
[53:04] thing that meant the most to you you
[53:06] gave it up see what I'm saying
[53:09] Abraham she will also give up the thing
[53:11] that's most valuable to them to please
[53:14] God and when you do that hallelujah you
[53:18] please God and what God says under you
[53:20] don't you worry about it I have provided
[53:23] myself for sacrifice you understand that
[53:26] sacrifice that sacrifice is perfection
[53:30] hallelujah the Lamb of God
[53:33] it was eternal we don't know where the
[53:36] lamb came from but Abraham was on the
[53:39] top of the mountain hallelujah and the
[53:42] Lambs are Rams are usually in the valley
[53:45] somewhere along there hallelujah hi you
[53:51] understand me
[53:52] when Abraham was God put a ram caught in
[53:57] the thicket and you didn't hurt him you
[53:58] say that I love the thickest you know
[54:00] that does something to me because my
[54:02] lord who was the Lamb of God also was
[54:04] caught in the thicket
[54:05] they put a thorn a crown on his head
[54:08] hallelujah they marked him hallelujah
[54:10] but even so they had to acknowledge he
[54:17] was still king of kings King of the Jews
[54:20] hallelujah you loved the Lord let me
[54:23] hurry up so we realize that if that be
[54:26] the truth about Abraham you also must
[54:29] know that when Sodom and Gomorrah was
[54:31] carrying on to that stuff and I'm not
[54:33] I'm telling you this so you can
[54:35] understand your promise see it ain't got
[54:38] nothing to do with how bad you are
[54:40] is God's promise yeah Oh God I think
[54:46] about the promises of God yes we tried
[54:48] to live right but when we fail we can
[54:51] look to the one who live right
[54:53] he's our sacrifice he's our lamb he's
[54:57] our perfection hallelujah there was
[55:00] something going on there
[55:01] because in the time of Sodom ah
[55:04] everybody in the days of song about all
[55:06] you see its perversion no there was
[55:08] something going on in the household of
[55:11] faith God was working with Abraham and
[55:15] he was working with Sarah to do what
[55:18] change their bodies hallelujah and
[55:21] that's what we must be looking at
[55:23] Abraham's seed you must be looking at
[55:26] the change of the body it wasn't
[55:29] anything that Shara did it wasn't
[55:31] nothing that Abraham did every process
[55:34] that made their body change from the old
[55:36] state into a new state was all about God
[55:40] so is it with us tonight everything we
[55:44] got to be the happiest people in the
[55:46] world to know that times and conditions
[55:49] means nothing to you it will not affect
[55:52] what God has purposed in you hallelujah
[55:58] is that right you look at this time and
[56:02] you understand that the burning of Sodom
[56:06] was that was a type of the burning of
[56:09] the world because the whole world has
[56:12] become peoples were lost you know and
[56:16] all of them no no no no the whole world
[56:18] has turned their back on God the whole
[56:22] world will be destroyed again hallelujah
[56:25] but there's a people I'm coming to it
[56:29] there's a people that's going to be
[56:32] changed in the moment and the twinkling
[56:35] of an eye hallelujah not by might not by
[56:39] power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[56:43] hallelujah look at it in that time of
[56:46] Noah the intellectuals great
[56:50] intellectuals building towers and Hall
[56:54] kind of things you know it's amazing
[56:56] that even Nimrod when he built the ark
[56:59] heaven on me the tower he must not have
[57:01] heard Noah's message either he heard it
[57:06] and ignored it and didn't believe it
[57:07] hallelujah is it to say this is the same
[57:11] God sent a vision in this day hallelujah
[57:15] and the visions had made the vision
[57:18] praying that he that readeth hallelujah
[57:23] would run you understand me
[57:25] the Bible said make the peace write the
[57:28] vision make it plain this is the only
[57:31] age of the seven church ages where the
[57:35] vision was written hallelujah we may
[57:39] call it the message but whatever it was
[57:42] a vision written that we might see what
[57:45] the vision is and he said read the
[57:48] vision let him run because the time is
[57:50] at hand y'all understand me this message
[57:53] didn't come to show you the end of the
[57:55] world for you to sit back and eaze in
[57:58] giant the Bible says make your call and
[58:01] election sure Paul said press in
[58:04] hallelujah labor to enter into his rest
[58:07] hallelujah when you are in the rest of
[58:10] God you don't have to worry about what's
[58:12] happening on the outside because you're
[58:15] on the inside hallelujah and where God
[58:19] moves you move hallelujah
[58:22] I'm not gonna be long hallelujah look at
[58:25] the building I preached this somewhat
[58:28] messaging in I Ohio you know but I'm
[58:32] putting some more to it so you can
[58:34] understand him in by God's grace the
[58:36] time that we're living in he said what
[58:38] what do you mean brother look at these
[58:40] people
[58:40] Nimrod tried to outsmart God smart smart
[58:44] God by building the tower the Bible said
[58:47] he built the tower into heaven
[58:48] hallelujah had not God come down he
[58:51] would have achieved it now look at these
[58:54] people
[58:54] if the ungenerous the sinner the wretch
[58:58] if they can get on one Accord and build
[59:02] such a power think about what the bride
[59:04] of Jesus Christ can do
[59:06] if we would just get on one Accord is
[59:08] that right brother branham said it like
[59:10] this
[59:11] he said if I can get ten people in one
[59:13] charts on one Accord the rapture would
[59:16] take place whoa so that means somewhere
[59:21] we're lacking this one according us here
[59:24] is that all right somehow we need to
[59:27] pray that God would put us on one Accord
[59:30] folks folks I don't know about you but
[59:32] I'll be I would feel wonderful to be
[59:35] able to pull on God enough that the
[59:39] rapture would take place hallelujah you
[59:44] say that's not possible he is possible
[59:46] Enoch did it about said Enoch walked
[59:50] with God hallelujah he was a man born of
[59:56] a sinful woman and father hallelujah you
[1:00:01] understand me but he's so walked with
[1:00:03] God God opened up the portals of heaven
[1:00:04] and said that's enough
[1:00:06] Enoch come on up with me that's what I'm
[1:00:09] talking about I'm not talking about
[1:00:11] church Hannah day I'm talking about
[1:00:13] living like God walking like God talking

[1:00:48] only the rich in the wealthy how do so
[1:00:54] so listen but but what they fail to see
[1:00:59] it's the Bible said they haven't an
[1:01:03] earth will be on fire so no matter where
[1:01:08] they are I don't care if they have in
[1:01:11] the end of the game the Bible said the
[1:01:13] cave and the mountains and always say
[1:01:15] Amen I can't hide you there's no
[1:01:19] place there's only one place of a ton of
[1:01:22] hottie and that's increase the old Maya
[1:01:26] feel good tonight just to know that
[1:01:28] we're right in the right shake the same
[1:01:31] time and conditions for something mighty
[1:01:33] to happen hallelujah
[1:01:35] I'm looking for that time I'm looking
[1:01:38] for that day I'm an expectation
[1:01:41] hallelujah I was telling my family only
[1:01:44] way over here said we gotta make a
[1:01:46] rapture
[1:01:47] this is rapture time this is translation
[1:01:50] tiny yeah we go stumble you gonna fall
[1:01:52] but you get up
[1:01:53] the Bible said adjust men fall seven
[1:01:56] times in a day
[1:01:57] he gets up hallelujah don't make them
[1:02:00] let the devil make you feel ashame
[1:02:02] paranoia because Jesus Christ died for
[1:02:04] your shame that's why he was naked on
[1:02:08] the cross he died for your shame your
[1:02:11] shame my shaking if I follow I get up
[1:02:15] and say thank you Jesus thank you for
[1:02:18] allowing me to get up thank you for
[1:02:20] allowing me to press on thinking Lord
[1:02:22] Jesus for being so good to me I love
[1:02:25] your grace I love your mercy even the
[1:02:28] devil he tried to take your joy because
[1:02:32] she stumble in you fall hallelujah but I
[1:02:35] deserve a loving father hallelujah I
[1:02:39] serve a God who cares
[1:02:41] hallelujah and you know what before he
[1:02:44] saved me he knew I wouldn't make
[1:02:46] mistakes before he gave me the Holy
[1:02:49] Ghost he knew I would make mistakes
[1:02:51] some people said when you got the Holy
[1:02:53] Ghost you don't make mistake me oh yes
[1:02:55] you do paul said the good that I would I
[1:02:58] don't do and the things that I don't
[1:03:01] want to do I find myself doing Paul the
[1:03:04] prophet of God was admitting that he
[1:03:07] makes mistakes
[1:03:09] all Christians do but we have a blood we
[1:03:15] have a blood that are never loses power
[1:03:18] hallelujah we have a blood hallelujah
[1:03:20] that's Justin properly there was there
[1:03:23] there's bloody so powerful
[1:03:25] amen God was able to put our names on
[1:03:28] the book before the foundation
[1:03:31] hey man this blood was holding the very
[1:03:37] life of God in it hallelujah
[1:03:40] and now if people could realize what the
[1:03:43] true Holy Ghost sealing experiences
[1:03:45] really is it is a total blood
[1:03:48] transfusion it is when God's D and E
[1:03:51] began to work in you instead of the DNA
[1:03:55] that your mom and your daddy gave you yo
[1:03:59] mama was a failure daddy was a failure
[1:04:02] hallelujah
[1:04:03] but the God that I serve that God that
[1:04:06] you sure we call him the Lord Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ he's my father
[1:04:12] he's my brother hallelujah and we had
[1:04:15] the same DNA hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:20] Matthew 17 18 18 through 20 and Jesus
[1:04:25] rebuked the devil he departed out of him
[1:04:28] and the child was cured from that very
[1:04:31] hour came to disciples to Jesus
[1:04:34] apart and said why could not we cast out
[1:04:37] Devils now this was before Pentecost
[1:04:40] this would come before Pentecost these
[1:04:44] people were not even converted yet
[1:04:46] because remember one time he said to
[1:04:48] Peter when you are converted you
[1:04:50] strengthen your brother go straighten
[1:04:52] him out earlier so some of these people
[1:04:55] these people they had Jesus with them
[1:04:57] but they needed Jesus in them
[1:05:00] hallelujah Jesus there's a lot of
[1:05:03] Christians who's got Jesus with them
[1:05:04] they got Jesus around them above them
[1:05:07] but that's not where Jesus want to be
[1:05:09] you have a heart and God's desire is to
[1:05:13] live in your heart you are the temple of
[1:05:16] God not your head but your heart
[1:05:18] hallelujah that's why you got to lay
[1:05:21] down everything says Lord
[1:05:23] enter into my heart and Jesus said unto
[1:05:27] them because of your unbelief for
[1:05:30] Fairleigh I said to you if you have
[1:05:32] faith as a grain of a mustard seed you
[1:05:35] should say unto this mountain remove
[1:05:37] hence to yonder place and it shall
[1:05:40] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[1:05:43] for you
[1:05:44] that's the Bible hallelujah we just had
[1:05:48] a sister who who would experience a
[1:05:52] horrible accident and you know she's
[1:05:54] born you know I don't know how much or
[1:05:57] how what the percentage of her body but
[1:05:59] but she's in critical condition
[1:06:01] but they thought she was going to die
[1:06:02] but but you know we got people praying
[1:06:05] you got people praying and you've got
[1:06:07] God who's listening you got God who
[1:06:09] understands amen you know what God he
[1:06:13] loves to see people who love people
[1:06:15] that's what touches God when you can
[1:06:17] enter into somebody else infirmity and
[1:06:20] pray for them that's what God wants to
[1:06:22] see he wants to see the love on this
[1:06:24] plane you don't have to know the person
[1:06:27] but you can feel it you can feel the
[1:06:30] person you can enter into that that that
[1:06:32] that feeling and right now she's
[1:06:35] recovering you know she's responding now
[1:06:39] because she was in a coma you know and
[1:06:41] they got on a lot of medication because
[1:06:43] of the skin grafts and things they had
[1:06:44] to do you know a husband if he wasn't
[1:06:47] there he no telling where she'd be and
[1:06:49] this is a lovely sister but we're gonna
[1:06:53] continue to pray for her as well because
[1:06:55] I believe that he's the same yesterday
[1:06:56] today and family I just believe that I
[1:06:59] if you call me of Jesus with an addict
[1:07:01] that would be a great compliment for me
[1:07:03] hallelujah because I believe he's the
[1:07:06] same if he's not the same how I'm gonna
[1:07:09] make a rapture if he did it for me I
[1:07:11] can't do it for me hallelujah you love
[1:07:15] the Lord and when you when you say well
[1:07:18] well the only reason why you see the
[1:07:21] church not moving is because somebody
[1:07:24] has unbelief you know it's not I said oh
[1:07:26] I believe God that's if it's your head
[1:07:29] it ain't going nowhere it's gotta come
[1:07:32] from the heart
[1:07:33] I believe God from the heart hallelujah
[1:07:37] because the Bob said it is from the
[1:07:38] heart the mouth speaketh oh go to God is
[1:07:42] that right
[1:07:43] remember I've talked about this kingdom
[1:07:45] come let thy will be done and I'm
[1:07:48] talking about things that are happening
[1:07:49] now amen and if God says let the kingdom
[1:07:54] of God be on earth as it is in heaven we
[1:07:57] need to be strong
[1:07:58] for that whatever they're doing in
[1:08:00] heaven is what we want to do here
[1:08:03] hallelujah
[1:08:04] don't you believe Paul Paul said you
[1:08:07] must die daily
[1:08:08] you got to kill this flesh every day you
[1:08:11] can't because it will revive and when
[1:08:15] the devil revived when the flesh revived
[1:08:17] you feel like you unsaved hallelujah
[1:08:21] thank God he doesn't judge us by the
[1:08:22] flesh is that right there's no
[1:08:26] condemnation to those who walk not after
[1:08:28] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:08:30] hallelujah and once the Holy Ghost is in
[1:08:33] you once the seal is in you you covered
[1:08:35] by the blood that's why the Bible said
[1:08:38] grieve not the Holy Ghost where about
[1:08:40] you were sealed hallelujah and I believe
[1:08:44] with all my heart that God is in his
[1:08:47] word how you gonna have confidence if
[1:08:50] you don't read his word you got to have
[1:08:55] confidence enough to read his word if
[1:08:59] this word is not for yesterday this word
[1:09:02] is for today is that right Hebrews 13
[1:09:05] and they said Jesus Christ is the same
[1:09:07] yesterday today and forever he's a god
[1:09:10] that changes not so his word is for
[1:09:12] today he's still the Alpha and Omega he
[1:09:16] still the beginning and the ending he's
[1:09:18] still on this yet he's still omnipotent
[1:09:21] he still Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Nissi
[1:09:24] y'all know he's still God and the Bible
[1:09:28] is another God he knows not who he
[1:09:31] doesn't know him so concentrate on the
[1:09:34] true and living God and that God live in
[1:09:36] you those things that seems impossible
[1:09:38] is possible he when he told his
[1:09:42] disciples he said Lord why can't why
[1:09:45] couldn't we cast out the demon he said
[1:09:48] because of your unbelief but I say yeah
[1:09:52] I like the way you when you say that I
[1:09:53] say if you say to this mountain mountain
[1:09:57] be thou removed that mountain has to
[1:10:00] move oh not a demon just not a demon but
[1:10:03] a mountain
[1:10:04] it means the faith is at the faith of a
[1:10:07] mustard seed a little bit but let it be
[1:10:12] don't let it be habit which a musta see
[1:10:14] cannot be hybrid let it be pill and if
[1:10:17] you have pure faith that means faith
[1:10:20] will never accept defeat except defeat I
[1:10:28] don't care how long it takes is will
[1:10:31] happen see but you're the temple of God
[1:10:34] and the Bible says let this mind be in
[1:10:36] you that was also in Christ Jesus how
[1:10:38] about condition but what do you mean
[1:10:40] brother Bush what I'm talking about God
[1:10:43] coming along and perfecting me hmm God
[1:10:51] coming alone and perfecting me well what
[1:10:54] I'm listening to his voice now if his
[1:10:58] voice is a voice of resurrection which
[1:11:00] it is and his voice went down to the
[1:11:03] last resort ooh
[1:11:04] there when Lazarus had laid for days
[1:11:07] rotten and stinking and his voice call
[1:11:11] for a man to come from the grave and
[1:11:13] this man gets up you say what do you
[1:11:20] leave brothers let me say like this if
[1:11:22] you die in faith you will be raised in
[1:11:26] faith and I don't know how it's actually
[1:11:30] done
[1:11:31] and wherever Lazarus was he knew he had
[1:11:34] to come back to where he used to be and
[1:11:39] God there wasn't another person never
[1:11:42] does the same person that went into that
[1:11:45] body but by the time the spirit of a
[1:11:48] lesser God and the body was made whole
[1:11:53] hallelujah and that's what I'm trying to
[1:11:56] tell you tonight
[1:11:57] amen it doesn't matter if you feel like
[1:12:00] you dead like Lazarus all you got to do
[1:12:02] is hear the voice of God and God will
[1:12:05] raise you up again hallelujah roll away
[1:12:09] the stone of unbelief hallelujah is that
[1:12:13] right the same kind of conditions
[1:12:16] hallelujah
[1:12:17] look as I said Nimrod didn't hear noise
[1:12:20] message they study building and just
[1:12:22] like the day today they didn't hear the
[1:12:26] I didn't hear the message of william
[1:12:28] branham do you know the world knew did
[1:12:30] you not know thousands millions of
[1:12:32] people were healed and delivered during
[1:12:35] his time where are they
[1:12:38] don't don't say where the White House
[1:12:40] didn't know God even God went to the
[1:12:42] White House made a miracle at the White
[1:12:47] House they picture there at the White
[1:12:53] House but if they don't believe it
[1:12:56] they're just like us
[1:12:59] you gotta believe it if we are the
[1:13:01] children of the generation of faith we
[1:13:04] must be like God hallelujah and God said
[1:13:07] let there be and it was so
[1:13:10] hallelujah that's the reason why the
[1:13:13] seals were open that's why the thunders
[1:13:16] rolled hallelujah because the sons of
[1:13:19] God there were time that God waited and
[1:13:21] he waited and he waited and that
[1:13:23] scripture laid there but the Bible said
[1:13:26] that the whole creation waits and grows
[1:13:29] for the sons of God
[1:13:30] not anymore the sons of God like it was
[1:13:38] in the days of Noah in the days of Enoch
[1:13:40] but they are here and they're speaking
[1:13:43] and a lot of people have no idea of
[1:13:47] what's happening God is building a
[1:13:50] pyramid all over again
[1:13:52] but it's by the hand of Jesus Christ
[1:13:55] just like he went to say how prepare a
[1:13:57] place for you that where I am there you
[1:13:59] may be also
[1:14:00] hallelujah he told his disciples is good
[1:14:03] that I go away cuz when I come again and
[1:14:07] that won't be with you but I'll be in
[1:14:09] you thank God for the Holy Ghost thank
[1:14:12] God for this temple that God has decided
[1:14:15] your temple that God chose to live in
[1:14:19] hallelujah that's what he said he said
[1:14:22] to decide but you better fear God don't
[1:14:25] you feel man he maybe even destroy your
[1:14:28] body but God is able to destroy your
[1:14:31] body and your soul
[1:14:32] hallelujah of the Lord it's going home
[1:14:35] time I believe that with all of my heart
[1:14:38] it's going home
[1:14:40] time let that mind be in you you are the
[1:14:42] temple of God and that beam case we need
[1:14:44] to learn how to do a hardness as a good
[1:14:46] soldier hallelujah
[1:14:48] y'all heard me in your hardness as a
[1:14:52] good soldier every time I think about
[1:14:54] that I think about Lazarus let the rich
[1:14:56] man table that only had a hard time he
[1:15:01] had a hard time and you actually wonder
[1:15:05] you you know what was it you know never
[1:15:08] has seen the righteous forsaken nor his
[1:15:09] seed begging bread I'm like where that
[1:15:11] laughter he looked like he was begging
[1:15:14] but he wasn't cuz the bread that he
[1:15:17] needed he had it hallelujah and that
[1:15:23] Brad was God I'm working on the message
[1:15:25] right now amen you know I look at this
[1:15:28] thing Lord i'ma just touch on it a
[1:15:31] little bit don't you know that Bethlehem
[1:15:35] means the house of God's bread oh and
[1:15:39] guess who was there who started you know
[1:15:41] it was it was a sad moan and started
[1:15:50] there and out of that lineage came who
[1:15:54] David and all the rest and you think
[1:15:58] about God using the prostitute to bring
[1:16:01] forth the Messiah hallelujah by the time
[1:16:06] he got to Mary it was a virgin but
[1:16:09] understand it wasn't a natural seed that
[1:16:12] Mary produced that wasn't it because God
[1:16:16] built himself a body according to the
[1:16:18] Word of God he was not only blood but he
[1:16:21] was also the seed and the end the body
[1:16:23] hallelujah but it was what happened to
[1:16:26] Jesus within that John Oh somebody help
[1:16:30] me here
[1:16:31] take that's what people don't understand
[1:16:33] in this last day you got to meet John
[1:16:35] before you meet Jesus in order to make a
[1:16:38] rapture they lied Oh hallelujah because
[1:16:43] it is the orry's the only one that knows
[1:16:45] who Jesus is nobody in the crowd knew
[1:16:48] him
[1:16:50] and he's the one the only one who knew
[1:16:54] who Jesus is he's not a denomination
[1:16:56] he's not organization
[1:16:59] he's the word hallelujah Oh glory to God
[1:17:02] and when you meet John John points you
[1:17:05] to Jesus hallelujah glory to God I'm
[1:17:10] talking about rapture material he can't
[1:17:13] change and guess what
[1:17:15] just like they beheaded John it has
[1:17:19] something to do they tried to destroy
[1:17:22] him
[1:17:22] that's why but they did in a spiritual
[1:17:25] way have nothing to do with this message
[1:17:28] he's a false prophet how can he be how
[1:17:32] could he be when they're bad well at
[1:17:35] least a man who they're doing the same
[1:17:42] thing same time same condition oh this
[1:17:46] man is up the devil and the blind man's
[1:17:49] are talking to be of the devil even you
[1:17:51] know scripture teaches that only God can
[1:17:54] heal all your chicken tells you that he
[1:17:58] said I know you can come to their
[1:18:01] whatever conclusion you want to come to
[1:18:02] but I can tell you this I once was blind
[1:18:05] but now I see that's all I'm saying
[1:18:09] I know it's real cuz I once was blind
[1:18:12] spiritually but now I see who could have
[1:18:17] opened my eyes for Jesus himself for
[1:18:22] Word of God and the Bible says according
[1:18:27] to proverbs 29:18
[1:18:28] where there is no vision the people
[1:18:30] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[1:18:34] is he hallelujah so the vision and the
[1:18:37] law or the word must be the same
[1:18:40] hallelujah
[1:18:41] he told us that this day was going to be
[1:18:43] Sodom
[1:18:44] no one's day he told us how the people
[1:18:47] are going to act he also told us that
[1:18:49] this world would be so insane the only
[1:18:52] people that would have their sanity
[1:18:54] would be the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:18:57] they calling us crazy because we live in
[1:19:00] holding
[1:19:02] you gotta preach this that's the time
[1:19:04] and condition we're living in you you
[1:19:07] can't you can't get away from it it's
[1:19:09] polluted the whole world I preach I said
[1:19:13] like this I believe all day and seven
[1:19:15] times worse than their day was
[1:19:19] hallelujah go back to Rebecca and the
[1:19:24] Lord answered me and said write the
[1:19:25] vision and make it plain upon tables
[1:19:27] that he may run that readeth it for the
[1:19:31] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[1:19:34] at the end it shall speak did not he
[1:19:38] spoke the book was open the lamb took
[1:19:43] the book out on the right hand of him
[1:19:44] who sat on the throne when people read
[1:19:49] that they think is - they think it's
[1:19:51] three but they don't understand
[1:19:53] hallelujah the lamb was in the very
[1:19:55] bosom of God and he walked forth as a
[1:19:59] man and took it and the Bible said that
[1:20:01] when John look for lamb he saw a lion
[1:20:04] and that lion was a tribe of Judah what
[1:20:08] was it he come to break order because
[1:20:11] that same angel stood there on the land
[1:20:13] and the sea and declared that time would
[1:20:16] be no more listen to the voice of the
[1:20:19] scripture will finish the only thing
[1:20:23] that God is doing now is working on his
[1:20:25] bride everything has been already judged
[1:20:28] that's why I Rome is coming in whatever
[1:20:30] virus is coming but his judgment like it
[1:20:33] was in the time of Egypt oh but there is
[1:20:37] a Goshen hallelujah there's a place of
[1:20:40] hiding there's a place of safety it's
[1:20:46] not a physical building it's not a
[1:20:48] physical place but it's all spirits
[1:20:51] hallelujah you love the Lord I'll say
[1:20:56] consider what I say and the Lord give
[1:20:58] the understanding in all things is that
[1:21:00] right we're under the same inspiration
[1:21:03] hallelujah if you're gonna preach this
[1:21:06] message you can't leave out nothing
[1:21:08] hallelujah that's what made the message
[1:21:10] so great
[1:21:11] because the Prophet didn't leave nothing
[1:21:13] out he hid everything
[1:21:15] every sin everything everything as
[1:21:20] preachers children of God we must preach
[1:21:23] it we must live it the same thing
[1:21:27] hallelujah
[1:21:28] you said was a prophet perfect know the
[1:21:31] Bible said Elijah was a man of like
[1:21:34] passions he had to fight just like you
[1:21:36] and I hallelujah but the God in him was
[1:21:40] perfect just like the God and you was
[1:21:42] perfect with faith seed we can't help
[1:21:47] ourselves hallelujah
[1:21:51] that's like asking the Lord street why
[1:21:52] are you producing orange I can't help
[1:21:54] myself

[1:21:59] tree
[1:22:00] I can't think like a pear tree I'm an
[1:22:01] orange tree and all I could do is
[1:22:04] produce produce oranges is that right
[1:22:06] see the seed in you is the thing that
[1:22:09] God's looking at folks hallelujah it
[1:22:12] ain't whose parents you had where you
[1:22:15] was born you could come back like the
[1:22:17] Bible tells us Jacob and Esau they came
[1:22:20] out of the same womb by the same mama
[1:22:23] same daddy and he saw was a devil see so
[1:22:31] it goes back to election hallelujah
[1:22:34] right you can have a Isaac and Ishmael
[1:22:38] hallelujah and he came from a different
[1:22:41] room and he was a devil but he had the
[1:22:44] same daddy yes grace its election is a
[1:22:51] choosing of God that's why I try to tell
[1:22:53] people when you sit back there and you
[1:22:55] act like you don't love the Holy Ghost
[1:22:57] and you don't want all to go something
[1:22:58] wrong with you you understand that the
[1:23:02] Holy Ghost is your life it is the life
[1:23:05] of the blood hallelujah
[1:23:07] o God have mercy without the life of the
[1:23:09] black there is no blood hallelujah
[1:23:14] that's what people understand no matter
[1:23:16] if your mama or your daddy are in the
[1:23:18] message it's still God's choosing mom
[1:23:22] and daddy can't get you there
[1:23:24] it's still God's choosing everybody got
[1:23:28] to have the seal of
[1:23:29] token other token seals right this is
[1:23:33] what he says every word in the Bible is
[1:23:35] God's thoughts laying in seed form so if
[1:23:41] the seed of God is in you you God's word
[1:23:43] it's the word that's laying in you

[1:26:23] form that if received into the human
[1:26:26] being and spoke by the same thoughts
[1:26:29] that materialize the Bible it brings the
[1:26:32] thing to pass you understand that's what
[1:26:36] Paul was saying let this mind be in you
[1:26:38] that was also in Christ Jesus because
[1:26:39] the very thought of Christ man was God's
[1:26:42] mind and when he spoke something he it
[1:26:45] happened right he spoke to the tree and
[1:26:48] said because you didn't bring forth no
[1:26:50] fruit you bewildered and they come right
[1:26:53] back and the tree is dead hallelujah
[1:26:57] is that right what was it it was the son

[1:27:28] most the time when things look like it's
[1:27:30] getting worse it's getting better
[1:27:32] Union hope fences and praise God never
[1:27:35] you defeated a man you're trying to make
[1:27:38] it look worse is that right what about
[1:27:40] the man when Jesus cast those Devils out
[1:27:43] of him
[1:27:44] right he had epilepsy and you know what
[1:27:47] the devil did he tried to put fear and
[1:27:50] panic in Jesus he started talking to the
[1:27:53] boy the boy around everywhere all
[1:27:55] through the fire whatever
[1:27:57] and Jesus stood there says okay when you
[1:27:59] finish use this time during tandem you
[1:28:01] doing you got to go you show it out okay

[1:28:20] looks like don't ever doubt that your
[1:28:22] prayer fail
[1:28:23] Jesus stood at the tomb of Lazarus says
[1:28:26] I know you hear me
[1:28:28] father I know you hear me as sons and
[1:28:31] daughters of God if the blood of Jesus
[1:28:33] Christ is covering you you ought to be
[1:28:35] able to stand there since Lord I know
[1:28:36] you hear me well you just did that well
[1:28:40] if you just did it you made it right he
[1:28:42] still hear you huh
[1:28:46] if God stopped hearing you he wouldn't
[1:28:48] hurt your prayer God said let there be
[1:28:53] before it could be a word it had to be a
[1:28:56] thought so God in the creation created
[1:28:59] the world by his thought is that right
[1:29:02] he spoke it and the thought expressed
[1:29:04] become material see what I mean y'all
[1:29:07] understand me well a lot of time we
[1:29:09] think is our thoughts well you know you
[1:29:11] can't cash out loaned ever
[1:29:13] surely the God gives you the thought to
[1:29:15] cash out of debit must come from God and
[1:29:18] if it come from God you need to speak it
[1:29:20] in faith and it happens I cast out
[1:29:25] devils try to give him me I can't oh you
[1:29:30] got to go like don't fellowship with
[1:29:35] darkness you got to go right now if that
[1:29:39] same spirit that said let there be and
[1:29:40] there was life that said let there be
[1:29:43] learned there was there was trees in the
[1:29:45] cage was mine that was in Christ being
[1:29:48] you how much could it say let there be
[1:29:51] no cancer let it would be gone let them
[1:29:54] let the blind eyes be open and it would
[1:29:57] be so see is your thought Jesus said
[1:30:00] right let there be y'all can y'all
[1:30:03] handle that that's a Bride of Christ can
[1:30:06] you handle that
[1:30:07] let there be
[1:30:09] let there be no more cancer you ain't
[1:30:11] got to carry on oh whoa whoa you don't
[1:30:15] shake nobody they don't have to fall out
[1:30:18] just speak the word believe it
[1:30:24] hallelujah but wait a minute see have
[1:30:28] faith in God for very verily I said to
[1:30:30] you if you shall say to this mountain be
[1:30:32] moved pluck up and cast into the sea and
[1:30:34] don't doubt it in your heart but believe
[1:30:37] that what you say will come to pass you
[1:30:40] will have whatever things you say it and
[1:30:42] there are situations in our lives that
[1:30:45] seems like mountains but those mountains
[1:30:47] are there in your life to be cast away
[1:30:50] not to stand in the front - it's there
[1:30:53] to be a castaway hallelujah is that all
[1:30:58] right what shall we say to him that
[1:31:01] Abraham our Father as pertaining to
[1:31:04] flesh had found if Abraham was justified
[1:31:07] by works he had we're out to glory but
[1:31:10] not before God for what said the
[1:31:13] scripture abraham believed God and was
[1:31:16] counted unto him for righteousness
[1:31:18] now i'ma jump back because remember when
[1:31:21] the seals were opened the prophet of God
[1:31:22] said it put the Christian man back into
[1:31:26] a place in Eden before the fall and the
[1:31:31] Bible even tells us that Adam was not
[1:31:33] deceived
[1:31:34] so Adam that he never disbelieved he
[1:31:38] just did it willfully did what he did to
[1:31:41] say he he never been safe never broke
[1:31:45] and so if that be the truth this message
[1:31:50] is supposed to create a fake in us they
[1:31:54] Adam had let Jesus had a fake that
[1:31:57] couldn't can't be broken hallelujah I
[1:31:59] think that had no space without our fear
[1:32:03] what it is what is it creating in you
[1:32:06] Christ must be formed in you hallelujah
[1:32:12] you love the Lord now I ain't about
[1:32:16] words and that's what the devil gets us
[1:32:18] some time to call listen what works we
[1:32:20] gonna do now the world only wanna hear
[1:32:23] gospel but what are you gonna find the
[1:32:26] true seed you know we're not about
[1:32:30] proselyting hello but we're at a time
[1:32:35] right now where majority of the people
[1:32:37] in the world are serpents they don't
[1:32:40] want God he said Lord lead me to
[1:32:43] somebody and what does God have to go
[1:32:45] through just to find somebody that even
[1:32:47] would talk about Jesus in public and
[1:32:49] Christians who don't want to talk about
[1:32:52] Jesus in public you can say God they
[1:32:54] don't mind you saying God but when you
[1:32:55] say Jesus and you better not tell them
[1:32:57] that Jesus Christ is God you are you
[1:32:59] ready for a fight you love the Lord but
[1:33:05] let me here let me say something to you
[1:33:07] and I'm a close in just a minute
[1:33:10] I've actually gone farther than I wanted
[1:33:12] to but let me let me say like this the
[1:33:15] scripture tells us blessed are they
[1:33:18] whose iniquities are forgiven let me
[1:33:22] jump up even as david also described the

[1:37:40] place this was on the street this wasn't
[1:37:44] even my room Jesus help me Lord let me
[1:37:51] hurry up so what come at this blessed
[1:37:55] being upon the circumcision only upon
[1:37:58] the uncircumcision also for we say that
[1:38:01] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[1:38:04] righteousness and we know where the
[1:38:06] Abraham seed so your faith is reckon
[1:38:09] that's why the devil mad with you he
[1:38:12] makes you make mistakes he causes you to
[1:38:14] do a lot of things that you shouldn't do
[1:38:16] but guess what you still have a rapture
[1:38:19] a date for translation because it's not
[1:38:25] your righteousness is here but he's
[1:38:27] going to see that the blood of Jesus
[1:38:30] Christ before it's all over you stand
[1:38:33] like God's on the earth his God's
[1:38:36] working not ours hallelujah and I'm so
[1:38:40] glad as he's working hallelujah
[1:38:44] well the time is now for the voice of
[1:38:47] the scripture speaks this afternoon that
[1:38:50] this is the hour this is the time Sodom
[1:38:53] and Gomorrah and all of these other
[1:38:55] things are setting just the way they
[1:38:57] were supposed to be setting and here you
[1:38:59] are showing to the royal seed of Abraham
[1:39:02] that you alive
[1:39:04] and the son of man is being revealed in
[1:39:06] this day of Sodom Heavenly Father grant
[1:39:10] that the people will see and when they
[1:39:13] come back that they are take God's Word
[1:39:15] just like Abraham did no matter when no
[1:39:19] matter where hallelujah you love the
[1:39:22] Lord I'm just gonna start right now
[1:39:25] but I love the Lord and I say you know
[1:39:29] we must understand that this is the
[1:39:32] Lord's doing you being here it's the
[1:39:35] Lord's doing mmm don't fear don't don't
[1:39:39] let the devil put you in such a place
[1:39:41] where you look like a miserable
[1:39:43] Christian y'all ever seen anything like
[1:39:45] that I've seen I've gone to malls and
[1:39:48] everything else and and you see
[1:39:50] Christian women you know and and you
[1:39:52] know look like they look holy but
[1:39:54] they're not expressing holiness you know
[1:39:57] what holiness is joy it ain't just just
[1:40:00] a clean life it's Joy's life holiness
[1:40:03] it's the Holy Ghost is God's life in you
[1:40:05] and when you sitting up there like Oh
[1:40:07] Lord I just you know you know lost your
[1:40:12] best friend as they used to say prayer
[1:40:19] is a place where God takes you the joy
[1:40:28] of the Lord is my strength and when the
[1:40:33] devil comes to you to cause you to lose
[1:40:35] your joy understand say look listen
[1:40:38] devil this is the rising of the Sun the
[1:40:42] Sun is riding right and the Bible said
[1:40:44] that when the enemies shall come in like
[1:40:46] a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall
[1:40:48] lift up a standard against now y'all
[1:40:51] know what that mean flood means people
[1:40:53] right and so when those two hundred
[1:40:56] million demons come in like a flood the
[1:40:58] Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard
[1:41:00] and you are the standard can you imagine
[1:41:03] I don't know how many I have to fight
[1:41:06] but the Bible raised me up at a time
[1:41:09] like this to fight demons why to defeat
[1:41:13] Satan it's the season in a time
[1:41:17] we're now reliving if I could say it
[1:41:19] like this the time of Myka and Lucifer
[1:41:23] and they were at war I stood with him
[1:41:26] then I'm standing with him now Jesus
[1:41:29] Christ it's long he defeated Lucifer in
[1:41:34] the beginning he succeeded Lucifer on
[1:41:37] the mountain hallelujah he defeated
[1:41:40] Lucifer at Calvary he said he defeated
[1:41:44] Lucifer before he comes again and I'm
[1:41:49] closing on me don't worry God has
[1:41:51] already made a wave xscape for you with
[1:41:54] every temptation the Bible said God
[1:41:55] makes a way of escape and you are the
[1:41:58] raw your seed of God is that right when
[1:42:01] devil tried to fit the Coquille oh yeah
[1:42:04] he killed Abel right he killed Abel so
[1:42:07] he figure from now on I'm killing
[1:42:08] everything to look royal but then God
[1:42:11] brought both sin
[1:42:13] hallelujah self was a Holy Roller
[1:42:15] there's that right whatever and however
[1:42:18] even wash himself a god Seth King doing
[1:42:22] the same thing hallelujah because the
[1:42:24] Bible said was set before being men
[1:42:26] began to worship God again hallelujah
[1:42:28] and that's what that's what the devil
[1:42:30] hate he hated know God's love worship he
[1:42:34] know that you and I was created for
[1:42:35] worship hallelujah God has said of him
[1:42:39] he had child him he had the four living
[1:42:41] creatures and all of them and he still
[1:42:43] wasn't satisfied until he made you and
[1:42:45] me he wanted something in his own image
[1:42:48] worshiping him Oh somebody help me here
[1:42:51] he wanted a Sarah
[1:42:53] they can call Abraham long y'all
[1:42:56] understand me Sarah was a type of the
[1:42:58] bride Abraham was a type of God
[1:43:00] hallelujah and guess what what's he
[1:43:04] whatever
[1:43:05] Abraham decided to do Sarah this lady
[1:43:11] why because she somehow all things work
[1:43:16] together for the good that didn't that
[1:43:18] love alone is that right
[1:43:20] and you got to understand Abraham he had
[1:43:23] all these experiences God was telling go
[1:43:25] left and he would go right
[1:43:26] however it would and you know he he had
[1:43:29] the Babylon experience he had different
[1:43:30] experiences all because he didn't listen
[1:43:33] to God and that's what happened to us
[1:43:34] sometimes we get in trapped sometimes we
[1:43:37] get caught and God has to pull us out
[1:43:39] like God pull Abraham out right but when
[1:43:42] it never changed because Abraham's
[1:43:45] covenant was unconditional y'all
[1:43:47] understand me so the bride of Jesus
[1:43:48] Christ it's unconditional you know what
[1:43:51] I'm saying
[1:43:51] so we go on and he said what love was
[1:43:53] what are you trying to say you keep
[1:43:55] going by God's grace and then you know
[1:43:58] how Moses God said no that's wrong
[1:44:08] you'll see they're right you came touch
[1:44:10] him and with all of those Babylonians
[1:44:13] Egyptian swordsmen and then went to kill
[1:44:16] all them children why what does the
[1:44:18] foolish virgin what is it she takes Kiko
[1:44:23] really she is she'll be killed while we
[1:44:27] escape what about with Jesus right row
[1:44:33] you see Harrison kill everything two
[1:44:36] years and under and why heaven was
[1:44:39] working
[1:44:40] Jesus was working God was working let me
[1:44:43] tell you something when they come in on
[1:44:45] us God has a way of escape hallelujah
[1:44:49] and Jesus the angel comes down as in
[1:44:52] Jesus taking Joseph take Jesus to Egypt
[1:44:55] why because I must call my son out of
[1:44:58] Egypt did he do it he did it
[1:45:02] and he's gonna do it again hallelujah
[1:45:06] every one of those patriarchs from the
[1:45:08] church first turn change all the way
[1:45:10] down could have escaped but that day of
[1:45:13] escape was dying sedated for you and I
[1:45:15] Paul I had to go to the chopping block
[1:45:18] Polly knew you Yahoo what I'm saying
[1:45:21] John who typed up the bride he was the
[1:45:24] only one that died of a natural death
[1:45:28] all of them died killed by the Roman and
[1:45:33] everything else but there's a bride and
[1:45:36] ever tried to find out who she is
[1:45:38] he knows she don't look like him cuz his
[1:45:42] his bride look like a prostitute she's
[1:45:46] looking like Eve did you know that how
[1:45:49] do you know well because I'm gonna tell
[1:45:51] you something when the devil is
[1:45:53] anointing a woman he makes her strip he
[1:45:58] stoop he makes her proud of her
[1:46:03] nakedness hallelujah but not a true
[1:46:06] woman of God of God she's not a proud of
[1:46:09] her nakedness she covers everything
[1:46:14] because she was the word to cover
[1:46:16] everything he loved the Lord know this
[1:46:22] enemy comes in you know how we don't
[1:46:25] have to worry about it because
[1:46:26] Revelation chapter said that just before
[1:46:29] the woman when the woman gave birth see
[1:46:31] the devil was coming but the woman gave
[1:46:34] birth before he got there
[1:46:36] and right now brother Branham preached a
[1:46:40] message birth pain and right now the
[1:46:42] bride is in birth and she's soon to be
[1:46:45] delivered because before that the enemy
[1:46:48] comes she will be already delivered a
[1:46:51] child she already will produce Jesus is
[1:46:55] that right and the Bible said once she
[1:46:57] produced Jesus that child was caught up
[1:46:59] into the heavens hallelujah and she had
[1:47:03] to go in the wilderness for three and a
[1:47:04] half years I said Lord what does that
[1:47:06] mean he said that's where the northing
[1:47:09] of God would go back to the Jews and
[1:47:11] preach to them the
[1:47:12] oh they goes attract chat tracks how
[1:47:17] many was it it transitions and will be
[1:47:20] up there three and a half years now
[1:47:22] heaven is not a wilderness Moses and
[1:47:29] Elijah will come and preach to the Jews
[1:47:32] the same message what a powerful house
[1:47:37] God said in one day can you see a
[1:47:43] hundred and father foe not that just
[1:47:45] count you mean children down south we
[1:47:59] say chillings can you imagine
[1:48:04] that's why the private God said to go to
[1:48:06] leap over walls and run through the
[1:48:08] mouth oh Jesus hardly knew against where
[1:48:14] folks I don't know where that was gonna
[1:48:16] interrupt my dinner with him or not but
[1:48:17] I sure would love to see you blessed and
[1:48:20] we're right at the dressing for the
[1:48:23] threshold of this lovely thing that God
[1:48:25] has done we ought to be so happy time
[1:48:28] hard times are going to come it's gonna
[1:48:30] get rougher but that's okay you got
[1:48:32] peace maintain your peace if you keep
[1:48:36] your minds head on him he said here
