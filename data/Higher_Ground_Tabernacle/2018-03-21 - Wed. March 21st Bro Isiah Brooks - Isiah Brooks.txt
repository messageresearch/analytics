finding more power there I've ever dream hi learning to lead [Music] a man learning to lean on Jesus perfect song you didn't even see my nose did you yeah surely God is good to us glad to be in the house of the Lord one more time as we stand by God's grace as we stand let us turn to psalms 89 oh my we've been having some services lately I trust everybody has healed amen I won't say I'm um how can I say it by His grace I'm healed because the Word of God amen is a two-edged sword and if you were not affected by the messages that we recently reached there's something wrong unless you've come to your own perfection but I believe that the messages that we talked about on the will has has been able to touch every soul every heart has made you think it has made you repented you know a Word of God is not a Word of God if you're not willing to repent and I think every man of every man or woman who ever you may be that's why we come to the church we come here to be corrected you know it's uh you know I I'm the I'm the kind of person and I know for certain that God gave me those messages there's no way that I would have preached a word like that and I say it like that because I was being sliced and diced myself but the motive behind the messages that have come you know the ones that brother Troy preached prior to the one that I preached have been motivated by divine love our interest amen tonight is making a rapture not just being a church member there are many church members that will come up after the white at the white throne judgment you and I want to bypass brother branham said that's one place we do not want to go matter of fact he talks about Hill not being so bad compared to the white throne judgment oh yeah so it is something to fear it is something that you really do want to XK amen as we stand and turn to psalms 89 beginning at the 27th verse you love the Lord Amen surely God is faithful to us 89 we begin at the 27th verse also I will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth speaking of Jesus Christ my mercy will keep him forever and my covenant shall stand fast with him his seed also will I make to endure forever and his throne as the days of heaven if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments if they break my statues and keep not my coven Commandments then will I visit their transgressions with the rod and with their iniquities with the stripes nevertheless by loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail not your faithfulness his faithfulness my covenant will I not break nor alter the things that is gone out of my lips once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David his seed shall endure forever and its throne as the son before me it shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in hmmm that word says a lot that means to meditate on it isaiah 55:10 2:11 I love this scripture it just speaks to me every time I read it Isaiah 55 in through 11 I think a lot of time being in this message we often forget that revelations the third chapter calls calls for repentance from the Laodicean Church age and and the Bible tells us to be zealous to repent that means amen don't hesitate with it because our time is short we are living in one of the shortest Church ages we're looking at an age that everybody is thinking about you know Ephesus but remember the bride has an age to herself for the Berlin City it's an invisible age where there is an invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom we have been smitten out of Laodicea and we are different kind of people so isaiah 55:10 3:11 for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and return it not thither but watereth the earth and make it bring forth and bird that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but if it but it shall accomplish that which I please and then share prosper in the things where the two I sent it Oh now to me how can you not trust God let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves as we hear your word give us grace to receive your word it's about receiving Lord we are the female order of this Union and it's about receiving your word give us grace to receive may the ground that the it fat be found on be a good ground to bring forth a hundredfold help us now in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I like to just kind of work with the promise is sure a lot of times if you tear down something it's important to rebuild understand by God's grace is like when God when you as a parent when you spank your child you don't just leave them you know with the wounds and the bruises you you've got to restore them by saying I love you and and you know when God comes along and he begins to tell us how much he loves us and how he cares for us then the the beating is not so bad but I wanted to say something because I and all of that I've studied and I want to just take my time tonight yet be short as possible the thing that I have studied I have thought about all of the impossibilities or that which is impossible for man to do and one of the things that we know that it's impossible for man to save himself the scripture tells us that our eggs are our righteousness is as filthy rags and and you know we are incapable of adding one stature one cubic to our statue we are a helpless creature for the Branham said it like this he said we were born failures to begin with here we are amen in this chaotic world I mean we're in that we see the coming of the Lord we see that God is looking for perfect people and and as we approach the light of God we see how bad we are we see that even on our greatest efforts we are so far away from God's holiness how are we going to get out of this situation if God doesn't do it you and I I think about the question that was asked Peter after the 70 departed and Jesus turned to Peter and said will you leave - and Peter response is like me and my response you know where am I going to go you the only one that has the words to eternal I we know I feel its presence we know that there is no other truth outside of the word of God every word of God is true and we know by revelation that God sent us a prophet the Prophet didn't preach his own thoughts and ideas we have coming Allah in this last day and we've seen how the enemy has come and he's actually tried to destroy remember the Book of Revelations a virus said all of a sudden stars will fall from heaven understand you know he's not talking about denominational stars they were already falling but there will come a wind that will cause the stars to fall and you understand every time you deal with when you're working with winds of doctrines doctrines of men that were calls great men who were once stars to fall and we are experiencing that right now among ourselves we have seen stars fall that people owe the booklet we are living in the book of Revelation you have seen by God's grace how that even in our day it's difficult to get people to repent a lot of people feel sorry but being sorrowful it's not repentance until you change from your wicked way and to the ways of God that's what true repentance is so I wanted to assure you tonight by the instruction of the Holy Ghost that if you have the faith to believe you can speak to this mountain and this mountain must move brother branham enlighten us through the knowledge of knowing that we are not only created in God's image but we are little creators now what you do with your ability is up to you but if God says we can speak you said well I didn't get no unction from God well let's go back to the scripture the Bible says Amen that Peter and the rest of them were on the ship and the storm came up and at that time Jesus was asleep in the boat and instead of using the power that God had given them to cast out Devils and to heal the sick they began to scream kind of like what Moses did they panic under the circumstances and the situation and went and awake Jesus and said careth thou not that we perish when Jesus awoke he stood on the ends of the boat and he spoke to the boat to the winds and a waving and said peace be still immediately the Bible said that the storm ceased and then he said to his disciples o ye of little faith sometimes you're not gonna feel goose bumps sometimes you're not gonna hear his voice amen to give you instructions amen but you must understand that he has already given you the instructions and you had the authority hallelujah is that right he told Adam to do everything Adam had the ability Adam had the authority and once you receive the authority you don't have to wait to use it in some cases of course but not in all cases I said this to understand understand when God makes a promise that promise is our surance is that right I promise is that our assurance Amen when when when it looked like God how can I said Israel was going to give another king outside of Solomon Bathsheba went to the king and said but but you promised that Solomon would set on your throne then what is this noise what is this this this stuff going on this plight this planter for another king she said Solomon I need you to show the people I mean seeing the king I want you to I want you I need you to show the people that Solomon is to be king did God do it see whenever you approach God according to his promises God has to fulfill those promises and he's going to feel them fulfill those promises anyway the reason why I love Psalms 89 is because it gives space it gives me hope it gives me trust because here God makes a promise and he makes this promise to David and and and and and and and and his seed and says now if you'll see go wrong if something they do if they go bad he said I'm gonna spank him now every sin deserves our just reward I'm gonna spank him I'm gonna whip him but I will not turn my back on them basically why because if I turn my back on them then I fail and God will never fail I will not forget my covenant that I have made with David and his seed Oh some help me here he said my covenant I will not break nor alter the things that are going out of my mouth I've already said it and nothing can alter it nothing can turn it hallelujah our Father the spiritual I read where I read there in Isaiah 55 it tells us that and this is what I love because if you have you've ever farmed anything you know the dynamics of sowing and reaping and you know many people they the farmers they they take the seeds and they sow them and they can't tell you how many ears of corn that's going to come up they can't even tell you amen you know how it happens all they know is that they saw it out there and what the thing that we call nature makes it come to pass there is you know it's amazing because those little seeds have no mind of their own but there is a higher authority there is a God somewhere that a knows each seed that have light in it every seed that has light in it will come forth if there if the conditions are normal conditions and the Bible tells us here that how that when those seeds are returned goes out and in a broad and bring seed and in all of these things it just doesn't stop like for corn or wheat and then then it gives bread to the soul right in other words there's a purpose for God's showing seed the seed that God so it men will come back for a purpose hallelujah it is not just for bread but for sons and daughters of God hallelujah and it's to see that God concentrate on don't you understand that God didn't save you because he was a good boy a good girl but there was a seed he sold into each each and every one of us before the foundation of the world hallelujah and that those seeds will perform those see I will not come back board because every seed that God planted it was planted by the word because it is the word and I love that because he shows how that seed gotta go through seasonal changes you're gonna go through seasonal changes you're gonna have a mountaintop experience you're gonna have a valley experience hallelujah you're gonna have a summer winter spring and fall I don't care how long you feel a Christian you not exempt from the weather changes but in all of this you must understand that God is working it out for you hallelujah but because the Bible says that all things work together for the good as brother Richard I were talking about it doesn't mean that everything gonna work good it doesn't mean that everything is going to go smooth but doesn't matter how rough it goes God gonna keep his promise about his seed and his seed will always come out of willow that is the truth and right now in layers here you think God and I made a mistake by bringing you here and this most evilest I hallelujah he brought a profit into the profit off the scene before this time but he brought a bride he brought a whole bride hallelujah because he knew that no matter what hallelujah he knows that you and I are going to make it because we are not quitters how can we give up on God am I making myself clear you know if in this era you're seeing how wicked the people are I think he would go out in the woods and hide out think about it cause even in the 60s he could hardly take it he was ready to give up and God had to come on the scene and show him if you did this not only will your wife leave you but you will become a bomb a bomb right you can't do it you can't give up that's right because Amen I have sent you here for purpose and that purpose have not been fulfilled as of yet and the trashy stuff that was going on now cannot be compared to what's going on now that was a little trash we're in the dumpster now her meeting will win the garbage heaps hallelujah that's where we are Philippians 1:6 we gotta be confident you know I was telling the brother the other day and today I said you know what I cannot miss the rapture Oh see when we say that I want you to understand I'm not saying that I'm gonna make it because I'm not human efforts hallelujah I am going to make it because the works that work that it was determined and finished before the foundation of the law you cannot make it unless God has already become and you're going to make it I have confidence in this message because brother Branham said like this he said when we we are messengers of the message that's where we are messengers of the message my brother sent me that quote just the other day I'm like whoa that's powerful hallelujah and and we are the standard Ouma I'm almost jumping in it but God put us here for a standard we are not like those in Satan's Eden now God say cool away from Satan's either he said well brother ha ha how I'm gonna do it my wife will she teaches the children she says you know about reading and stuff like that you know the question was how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time I like that how do you defeat Satan one time one bite at a time hallelujah amen you get rid of this today get rid of this tomorrow get rid of this as the day comes on you run out of time focus on this thing hallelujah Lord how do I accomplish and accomplish this one at a time focus on where you need where you're at and what you need to do to get where you need to go then you pray Lord I need this help me in this help me in this ain't God good to us his plan remains unbroken he's God and the Bible tells us that everything was fashioned and found there is no alterations God doesn't come up to our day in time like oh I gotta alter this because if I don't alter like I said before God doesn't give curves on your grades he's not gonna law his standard he's perfect totally all the way that God can bring us to perfection is to bring us up to his standard but what really encourages me it's because the work was done and finished now he was talking to Hebrews and said yet I will not let them enter into my rest even though the works were finished before the foundation there were a lot because in the beginning in his mind they never could enter into his rest they had a different operation they had a different future but those are who are divinely chosen to enter into his rest there is not one thing that can keep them from it we're not working with a religious science we're basing our understanding on God promises it's not because we can read and we can understand and in studying like brother varlyn say take a scripture from here and a scripture from there he said all of that's good but the Bible is based upon revelation what good would it do you if you understand all of the Bible and yet you don't even have a revelation that you are true son and daughter of God what good will that do you you must know within your heart that God has made you a son and daughter of God oh I hope this is where it won't he be he says listen coming from possessing all things he says a beautiful type today unworthy worthy of death when we sin but God cannot kill us because he were we are part of Christ that's our grace because we are in union with Christ isn't that a beautiful thought union with Christ so therefore our sins when we do them we ought to quickly confess them that they're wrong because God would take our lives but the blood inserts in our place and God just can't cross the blood God can't cross the blood see he just can't do it because it's a promise that he won't do it so he can't break his own promise so God got himself as it was sewed up see he can't break his promise and he promised it through that blood whosoever believeth that eternal life he cannot break that promise so we find that Abraham in obedience left his home left his land separated from everything all his earthly possession a position to travel in the strange lands or journey a type of the church we've asked to forsake everything that's in this world in order to follow Christ that right Peter said Lord we don't we forsaking everything with a left family we've left everything what we're gonna get he said you gonna get family back to you go get some trials and tribulations hallelujah and you gonna get eternal life see you and I must understand that this message did not come to give us a hope it came to give us an assurance helped us a lot it right because we are in a place where we call Satan's Eden is that right we're in the zenith of it all we how could I say it we're in the culmination you know everything is built up amen we're in the pinnacle the peak amen of all of Satan's work hallelujah we got all kinds of demons against us hallelujah you gotta understand there was a real battle in heaven and that battle now has come down to this earth and God has saved the best for last who you and me hallelujah you may not feel like it but it ain't you that God is saying it's the seed that he planted in you hallelujah why because that word is rising up hallelujah is rising up people and no matter what Satan tries to do he cannot stop the Word of God Wow because the Bible said that word cannot return void there is somebody you ought to be glad that God planted seed in you hallelujah and God quick in that seat you said well brother looks I'm not where I should be I thought about this and been thinking about this I said you can plant a seed once he's messy to come up it has put a stem out here and to put a stem out here it'll put a still out there how many higher is built amen and this flower opened but you rarely see them all open at the same time we're still out of the same seed hallelujah still from the same plant hallelujah and so easy with us it's not how when we put out the bloom it's it's what time is what I'm in it's not what time you start blooming it's the fact that you are going to bloom as long as you have that same life in you that the first steelhead you got to bring forth yours it is like in nature he shows a man and you can plan all seas at the same time and they won't come up at the same time my wife was teaching the children planting little potatoes and stuff like that and they all planted at the same time and a little Judah plant came up like Ruth his plant sprouted up before anybody else I think a couple of them she had to change over sort of him because they never didn't come up you know and that's how it is hallelujah but everybody has their season yeah it's reachable why we cause we can we could not come up to him he had to come down to us is that right it's nothing but the true but humility is the key humbling yourself is the key remember brother Branham talked about this great painting I think notice that artwork and in this artwork was supposed to show Jesus Christ and and this man was really disturbed by because he said I don't see no agony I don't I don't see no pain in this man's face I don't see what this and and the keeper of the the artwork says it's because of the way you're looking at it he said you got to get down and look up once the man went down and looked up he like oh my god huh see you'll never be able to see Jesus Christ on this message until you get down you got a humble yourself hallelujah you got to see the beauty of this thing it's when you on your knees hallelujah not when you're standing up hallelujah is went on when you're on your knees it's so powerful because here you said was that the bride have a ministry she's got a ministry revelation 22:17 says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that here and say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely we got a ministry we just got to get on the job our ministry say come hear what God has said in this day hallelujah did not you know God is sent to John godess it's Allah and Elijah hallelujah we're not supposed to be ashamed of the name William Branham either American people y'all far we funny hallelujah and I know because we've had some powerful calls to come through this place well I think Jim Jones is just one of them you know and every time people hear of a prophet they talk about Jim Jones right I remember the time when this bandit brother rich job made mockery a rich when we had that shut-in you are all rich better not drank the kool-aid that man right now was George he's dead it had a horrible disease took him out just like that you cannot make mockery and think you're going to get away with it it ain't going to happen the saddest part is the man never asked for prayer didn't never repentant as far as we know uh so what do you think he is see no matter what people think we are and they could say you know oh y'all called y'all off the word you don't know where you know you don't know not see that they said it about Jesus they call him a devil the word himself they don't call you what they gotta call you the Bible said blessed is the man who's persecuted for my name's sake oh oh come on somebody see what right now we are here to show the power of the seed he's over week but that's kind of where God won't you it sometimes he because he said when you a week that's perfect strength then God can use you when you know you weak hallelujah see God don't use proud people and folks that think they dis that you know that God don't care about that but when you see a man that knows he's nothing and he knows he can't make it without God those are the kind of people God uses learning to lean Oh hallelujah I'm so week long a caged animal self a lawyer of lead I have a leader to Jesus hey that's what God wants he want those who can lean on him oh my god think about it we get it ready to experience some things people and people's over when the squeeze come on down low with y'all talking man I'm feeling some squeeze now yeah it may not be as hard as it gonna be but it's hey that's the birth pains going on in here and and I want you to know amen the pressure is on hallelujah coming from the how the message Pat but I said the power of the seat now how many I'm gonna read this because I want you to understand if John had it you got it hmm he said you will notice that John has addressed himself to the Christian as a brother in tribulation so don't worry about it folks tribulation is part of John's business and guess what you type out John think it not strange when you fall into divers temptations knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold hallelujah amen he said you will notice that John had addressed himself to the Christians hands a brother in tribulation it was at this time that the early church was going through great persecution their religion was not only everywhere spoken against is it like this oh you talk about God sending a prophet gods and enlarging in America it's spoken again you can't find one book in a bookstore hallelujah but you can find harikrishna Allah and everybody else in some world right but when it comes him into this Amen they tried to wipe it out hallelujah oh but what they fail to see is the book wasn't wiped out the book was eaten hallelujah he meant it may not be on the Shelf but the Bible said they were walking in pistols living Ridley pistols read by man the devil could never destroy the word their religion was not only everywhere folks spoken against but the people themselves were imprisoned and killed John like multitude of others was now suffering imprisonment of the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ when arrested they tried in vain to kill him by balling him in oil Oh for 24 hours Oh y'all people don't know what they got coming is worse than that and the only way that you're gonna escape this is that you got to have the same thing John hand hallelujah oh come on sorry John had an anointing and a God and him that cannot be boiled hallelujah he enraged listen he be enraged and powerless officials this sentence him to pantless has a which they couldn't kill him so let's get rid of this winch and they put him on the Isle of Patmos hello that's exactly where God wanted him to be they thought of they put him out there with the snakes and the scorpions nature would kill him hallelujah but they did not know the promise this one John will not die he will see the promises of the coming of the Lord is that right not that he wouldn't God in the natural but the Bible said before he would he would see the coming of the Lord even though the project possible in all they misunderstood the quote but he he lived it God manifested himself huh that's the power of the seed you saw our brothers were listen in your seed you have the power if they would put you in a batch of oil John is already this difference demonstrated the power of the seed don't you know when they take our automobiles Ravello my gardener took my car come on get there hallelujah talk to Philip hallelujah Philip had the power of the seed of God in him do you think God put it in the Bible for you to entertain you he was trying to show you what you had in you and what he was yesterday he's the same today God don't change that's why would it come the evening kind of sickness that devil has no right and the only right the devil have the hold on you you give it to him but a man or woman that really believed the Word of God hallelujah that is your solution to every devil show me and we would have never known but brother Brennan says Jesus was sick every devil tried to hit him but you never seen him running for help it was the word that defeated everything for him you love the Lord I'm excited why because I don't know how far how much longer my journey is on this earth hallelujah but I believe I'm a translated saying if God don't translate me he's surely where rap to me ah because I've got the power in the seed or the seed of the power is in me hallelujah woo if the devil only understood that God's seed was power what was that power brother BAM said it wasn't like some kind of voodoo or something like that he said that power authority hallelujah that's what the opening of the seals did for us people so what I'm trying to find out what the thunders is I am the thunders so are you hallelujah are the probably God call it living voices seven living voices living on the inside of you hallelujah that's what makes the bride different Amen we're not just a church age hallelujah we are in eternity we have no boundaries we are the words where God is bound God is not bound nobody can bind God the only one who can bind him as him himself he binds himself to his word what a powerful man he is all right Wow because we realized that whatever he says it has to come to pass we don't need have no need to darling what my point is this what what what what can you gain by doubting God because whatever he has declared is going to happen anyhow huh it's going to happen oh I don't believe that there's gonna be a flood you believe he said it was going to have a flood and he flooded is that right he said go tell Damon told dip seven times seven times naman and if you did seven times you gonna come up home don't you realize that even today they don't even have no medication for leprosy nothing that can cure you of leprosy all your fingers on a dog they can't have de magnetic and restore your fingers but God said go tell naman go down there and if he did seven times you come up home Naima said I got the dump in that old nasty water hallelujah I don't care how nasty it would have been hallelujah knowing my condition hallelujah and you want to be made whole what good why do you care how God give me the Holy Ghost he may give you the Holy Ghost just sitting still he may give me the Holy Ghost run roll into whatever what good I don't care whatever it takes everybody trying to get to God did take the God how to give them the holy goes out all day I don't want that kind you don't want that kind you don't get that kind who cares or what I can tell you he totally do caught wind slipped and everything else I'd do everything I can to do it even if he said Brad was flip keep practicing can I do till I can do one just to get what his promise is you understand oh here's another you can't pray enough the Bible said pray without ceasing I you know I looked and I was talking to her brother and and say you know what really I do I that's what Satan fighting me more than anything I like to feel him you know I don't always feeling when I'm praying but I always believe it ain't by my feelings it's about what I'm believing if I come to God and prayer and ask him of anything that's what he said he said listen he said I will hear you and that's what I've concluded ain't about feeling today it's about faith hallelujah because I know one thing when your body is racked with pain you do not feel like hallelujah but when you ask God to heal you he will the hallelujah comes after the healing we can rest assure that we are people that has been handpicked by God who has a promised us eternal life and he cannot go back boy you see what brother Bruce I'm not what I should be don't you worry God will make it happen hallelujah you know you believe in one touch that's all God is one touch that later said it all but if I could just touch the heel of his garment I'll be made whole that's all one touch hallelujah a one word from God hallelujah Young stand me the man who have been blind the man who who's at the Pool of Bethesda all he had to do was come in contact with the Creator who was Jesus Christ himself hallelujah that's all you need hallelujah tonight just come in contact with him and your night will be turning today this is my family time hello when I come to church I come to see family I don't come to see strangers oh come on I don't even come to see cousins or aunts uncles or grandad is a grandpa I come to see brothers and sisters hallelujah listen it's the truth we are special class of people a special class of people you know we so worried about our failures and we forgot we were failures when we came to God then God gives you the Holy Ghost or give you ears to hear how many I believe that the Bible said blessed is the man who can hear not just read it if you can just read could there's some of us who can't read and comprehend holiday but if we can hear it so you can be blessed and cursed at the same time oh my he said you remember and this is from Revelation chapter one the revelation of Jesus Christ he said you recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his works in the future ages that I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take your just ordinary study and thinking to make this book ordinary studying and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that mean that means this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it would require their ability to hear from God it would require supernatural instructions not just from a student comparing verses with verse though that is good but a mysterious a mystery requires the teaching of the Spirit or will never become clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become unit to the spirit to hear and know as I have already said the book revelation is the consummation of the scripture it is even placed exactly right in the Canon of the scripture at the end now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that would give you authority over the devil well it is the revelation of God that would give you authority over the devil and you can see why they would walk would add or take away from it it's cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word see in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priest reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as it was the word and the blessings was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard y'all hear me so you look at this thing where I don't know what I should do hear it or read it you got two options hearing it or reading it it may call God pronounces blessings on you whew somebody help me help me help me you and I must realize by God's grace the devil is man eat cake stop it oh he thought all I will stop this prophecy and he put Jesus in the grave for three days and put a Roman stone who put all those guards around that stone don't you let him get up hallelujah but what they found a seed it was out of their hands the world of God could not they could have put two stones three stones whatever it would have never kept him in the grave because the Bible had already spoken I will not let his body see corruption that's when I hear him when I hear the scripture say that I don't think about the one man I think about the body of Christ I will not let them see corruption there will be a resurrection that what he tried to corrupt us we can't why because the flesh is already corrupted hallelujah but that's all no matter how he tries the seal cannot be broken hallelujah amen when God put his life in you hallelujah the devil was finished that was finished this flesh already judged God gave you the Holy Ghost and put it in a flesh is already condemned and judged hallelujah God knew that this flesh was gonna give you trouble that's why I said grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you will see you to the day of your Redemption see we look at the grieve I look at the seal to the day listen cuz you and I must understand God always does or will do a perfect work now half won't do I was there 59 19 through 21 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and its glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him somebody ought to understand what I'm saying hallelujah what was he working with this thing the enemy shall come like a flood and God will lift up a standard what is that standard oh I'll tell you there's a lot of things that went under the flood of Noah but what came out is the thing that's true at the flood was the pyramid hallelujah and the bride can take whatever flood God's allowed to come oh I'm not talking about your first time I was in you yes we use that same scripture on an everyday basis but there's coming a flood the Bible says that even when that dragon opened his mouth a flood comes out brother Balaam said that flood came out against what the bride of Jesus Christ he also used it as as a type of what's gonna happen with Israel hallelujah but that son was caught up and he used that same type working with the resurrection and you know what I'm saying it's coming the same time when that flood comes we're gone Israel gonna have to walk in the wilderness for three and a half years and there Dean shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from the great transgression and did unto Jacob said the Lord see what I'm saying as for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon them thee in my words which I put in thy mouth shall not depart out of that mouth nor out of the mouth of that seed nor out of the mouth of that CC said the Lord from his and forever hallelujah amen a lot of times you don't even know you got it in you until something happens then the Word of God comes out hallelujah why because God has placed it in your mouth hallelujah who do you think living this Tabernacle hallelujah I hadn't told you God don't work with duplexes hallelujah it's a single room house hallelujah and Jesus Christ is sitting on his throne where in you is that the truth when the Bible tells us that think is Ezekiel got old Lucifer no Isaiah we stop it I'm gonna rise and I'm gonna excel above the throne of God and what do you think he talking about God ain't he told David what house can you build me you know here I'm saying the earth is my footstool and heaven is my throne how can you build me a house you see what I'm saying what did God God's throne in the beginning was the heart of man somebody help me here see it is the devil right now that's working with the heart - hallelujah he meant because the Bible said he was set in the house of God on the throne the throne of God it meant declaring himself that He is God he's a liar but he's already there in the hearts of denominationalism and organisations setting on their hearts declared that he is God hallelujah feed him the Trinity hallelujah but all there shall be light in the evening time hallelujah where God has come to expose who's on the throne hallelujah and the Bible said that light comes and he throws him off the throne y'all better help me come on this ain't just the city that's - but you gotta understand everything that's happening a TRO is what's happening spiritual you say well I don't know about that well explain this brother man think I said in it he said in the future home he said and he takes that scripture where Jesus said I'm gonna sit on my Father's throne well where his father's gonna be who and you got to understand God ain't talking about no chair but brother Baylor has they used types and symbols amen to show us cuz he shows us that here's the pillar of fire Jesus sitting on the throne and here's the people of God those who are redeemed halle-loo he's got to show us where the authority is the authority goes back into the very that is back to the the Elohim but brother Branham said that God will not ever to return back to that but because his throne would be his people how you go judge people because the Prophet god said to us he said God is omnipresent he said but not because he's everywhere but because of his foreknowledge he said God is a person hallelujah but all but if God got a lickin you a licking me like he had Adam out Anna who Anna was the throne of God on earth hallelujah that's why Adam could name all the animals correctly because it was God in Adam name in the animals and so when it comes him into judgment you and I must understand we're not gonna be judging the people of cause of our righteousness it will be judging the people to call of his holiness it's God in us judging the people somebody help me 23 and 29 through 29 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way a good man anybody know what I'm talking about who's a good land yeah you got to realize that rich the ruler said oh good master he said hold up there's only one good and that's God hallelujah so if you calling me good master you understand this God is with me oh oh he said Jesus said he loved that he loved the boy him and then he fell let me go back the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighted in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand I have been young and now I'm old yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is for he is ever merciful and lived it and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell forever for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaken not his Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever now believe that hallelujah you said well I'm not righteousness yes I am you may not be but I am he became my sin that I might become his righteousness and if he says I'm his righteousness I am his righteousness Romans 8:26 y'all don't mind do you Romans 8:26 2:30 I'm trying to encourage you oh my god I II I'm entered into his rest Hey I worried no more hallelujah yeah and what you think you gonna change something in all your prayers the perfect will of God is still will be done and he doesn't owe me no explanation I accept every choice of God Amen what he choose to do is all right with me look like I will tell her somebody I said now the point is what is it gonna profit you to disagree with him hello the Bob said can anyone instruct him anybody got some wise counseling to give him but I says you know what you have his mind is that the word he said what you have is mine that's powerful to me so let it be Lord so let it be Romans 8:26 says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities but we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself making intercession for our groanings which cannot be uttered and live even in times when you don't pray he prays even at times when you shouldn't should be praying he prays even in times when you don't know how to pray he's praying hallelujah you got to understand it if the Spirit of God y'all know God don't answer prayer for you before you even prayed for it you know what in your prayer but what's the Spirit of God that went before you to pray for you hallelujah oh the bow that he searches the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the Spirit so God know what you want your intent is he knows when you really love him but you're too weak to fight oh it's the truth he know he knows that you're gonna fall it's nothing purposely far but he already said that I just made my rise up seven times hallelujah you don't have quit on the inside there's nothing you can quit Wow cuz you so love him you know he's the righteous one you know he's the Holy One you know he's the one that's faithful hallelujah yes we're not faithful hallelujah and in ourselves we're not holy hallelujah but because he has given us his holiness because he has given us a robe of righteousness that's what makes us holy and righteous Oh faithful faithful and true no wonder David said great is that faithfulness well because they're your mercies are renewed amen every morning every morning hallelujah that means them for the holy for the righteous for the elect they will never run out hallelujah I can't run out of mercy now when it come to me he can't run out of mercy hallelujah the only people that can cross the line of those who didn't come from him cuz a son is a son and brother branham said I like this he said seeing seeing we've affected affected the fellowship broke it but seeing could never stop the relationship a son is always a sign huh and he says we know that all things work together for to give that them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose before whom he did foreknow did he know yeah he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son if he knew you he's already predestined attitude to be conformed to his image not I don't know how long you're gonna take hallelujah but I have been appointed and you will one day anointment amen and therefore transform me into the very image and likeness of God I trust him I was telling a brother the other day I have fasted I have prayed I've done everything throughout the years that I know that will bring a change God a move by all that God has and group by faith yes enemy you can do all that and still don't have faith that God can change you you gotta believe that that change can be made and it ain't based about whether my fast 34 today that ain't it God can change you the mullah but you gotta believe that the moment is yours you have a moment one of those moments that God is healing is lying one of those moments that God has deliverance is lying every moment there's a moment for everybody and somewhere you've got to find your own pull it in hallelujah you got to receive it hallelujah it's just like the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can be all around you but if you don't receive it for yourself you won't get it hallelujah you got to have that's mine that's mine that's mine that's how he comes he's already giving it out he can't give it out no more it's right here and you've gotta pull it into you and say it's mine that Holy Ghost was meant for me hallelujah God giving a gift to everybody you're gonna sit around and let him give to everybody a little child wouldn't even do that that little child you giving out gifts tickle stand right there till you reach out and give them one hallelujah let our minds become like children tonight hallelujah you ain't got to give it to me the heart you gave everybody I'm yours and I know it I can't explain it but I know it hallelujah all things work together yes I'm gonna go through things just like everybody else Peter James John Amen the disciples though they walk with Christ they were not exempt from trials and tribulation not even Jesus himself was exempt from trials and tribulation and neither will you hallelujah but the Bible said and all things give thanks Lord I don't understand but I'm gonna thank you anyhow hallelujah Wow because you're worthy see what do we we forget like I said we forget all the good things we forget all that God is doing for us and we concentrate on that little area in our life and we're oh my god what are you talking about hallelujah hey man if I've got a stump on my toe praise God you think I'm not gonna be a it ain't gonna be painful oh but I'm gonna thank God for still having at all in my have a womb but I'm gonna thank God for a man for he for knowledge he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first fruit firstborn among many brethren moreover this is I love it brother Branham brush it out beautifully well all the whom he did predestinate them he also call did he call you did he call you or did you come because somebody some man brought you he called me and if he called me he what justified live if he Oh y'all know what justified justified mean that you didn't do it in the first place he justifies you so if you don't have sinned against you what hinders you receiving the Holy Ghost there's nothing in your life as far as God sees nothing that can stop you from getting his Holy Spirit nothing you survive you justify the blood has justified yo hallelujah you got the approach the one less guarded hallelujah you know Baba demands Hannibal I blow system , Christians today huh blind Bartimaeus knew he was blind there's a lot of Christian don't know their money but they're blind Bartimaeus knew he was blind and he heard that Jesus was passing by hallelujah if you can't feel him you don't know he's passing by right now there's something wrong with you [Music] hallelujah knew he was a mercy o me that's the problem with the people they don't know how to read I didn't bring him in hallelujah where the belen said he didn't hear him but he felt you virtue left him hallelujah that Rai is a disciple said what do you mean come out to touch you who touched me when it came to the woman each of us and know somebody touch me virtue is gone how do we when you trust Jesus virtue is gone but when he touch you virtue is given Oh Oh help me Jesus we are a new creation how y'all y'all believe that only things are passed away behold all things that come new that's why I wouldn't devil try to bring all the things that you you say W wrong That's not me that's the other person I'm a new creation I don't want that anymore I don't eat that garbage no more right how many y'all in here go around right now I'm gonna eat them in the garbage I don't care if their eyes and nets and worms even who know that's what we do sometimes hallelujah when you go back to the pig nature that's what you become hallelujah and but just to see a man Amen right now going there and you see the garbage in the slop and you it would make you sick ha because your nature is different it's not in a man to eat slop Bella Bevin said only when a man is really hungry will he eat out of a garbage can because I'll never say I won't get out of it is that right see he was the beginning of God's creation I thought Lord that is so true and then Jesus come out at last the last church I was telling brother Dan said what people don't see it ho my god what people don't see in this message is God's new creation it was so tired to lay on the sea and tied to all of the things that denominationalism we can't even see that there's a new creation going on this message hallelujah hallelujah Oh mate oh lord have mercy but but brother branham tells about he said when you know I've heard people say I've heard people say a lot of things and I'm not going to try to interpret but I said there was a half-hour silence and you think and I all I know is that if Jesus Christ was the beginning of creation there was something going on that he wasn't telling everybody and all of the ages harshed and see you can go throughout the scriptures and you'll never see where the heavens crushed that's why this message is so powerful and God is doing something but is dealing with creation he's working something in us that even the angels can't figure out how such a nasty people out of later see he'll come up in here who doctors generation well hello that's the word he came to the worst age ever with filth was the grain is beer raining and he chose somebody like you is that right brother branham said he just saw just like a man getting the dirty glass he picks it up a little I kind of like this class and then he washes his he sanctifies it he says sometime he might put it up on the shelf until the day of his use hallelujah God might have you on a waiting period but at some point in time he gonna use you and when he usually gonna feel you hallelujah yes sir he gonna fill you up ain't no doubt about it but the devil wish he understood what was going on because he had only one time he messed up one time word and only because his thought was impure one time but think about the river the RET the rebellion that that devil brought in heaven because of the way he thought and how many angels that we don't even know fail for his life and me and they're doing the same thing you see these people looking for glory they're doing the same thing Lucifer did they're using God's power for their glory hallelujah ain't like a real church silver and gold have I none but such as I have brother Brando say that's when you know you've got a real pillar cause the preacher is that right oh you see these people out here with all kind of Cadillacs all coming this and all kind of that day nothing but Church pimps that's what they are it brought them like in the organizations that's prostitution they gotta have a pimp somewhere and they doing it they acting it they doing it let's move on that that was that was free everything but this work that seed is unchangeable in other words you can't highbreed oh people don't believe that but I'm gonna tell you something this word is real I don't see the dead raised and stuff like that so nobody can tell me it's not real I haven't seen the denominational creature yet do it because not one can do it but this message can do it I don't seem too much I've seen God heal measles like that chickenpox me I'm on my children broke out one day and in the morning I've seen those things who could who could do that you've never seen you'll never see it when I talk about these things I'm giving God the glory I'm not interested in you said all Brotherhood's can do that I can't do nothing I'm not even trying to get on that level hallelujah I'm just telling you as a vessel of God what I've seen hallelujah I've seen the doctors tell the sisters you might as well abort the baby because that baby girl have spina bifida we done seen it with an X rise raise it and all that rights was a ruby we pray for that woman and that woman come out amen and her baby was healthy why don't see what a dad what if she would have bought that baby because of what the doctors say hallelujah my mother-in-law if I got the store right they don't tell us some about your going to something like so it just gonna happen and you're gonna die she said did the Lord did Jesus tell you that I want to hear your bad news when you became God hallelujah is this okay you see we want one seed I don't care how many generations it comes through their spirit the seed remains the same y'all hear what I'm saying the same she emphasis hair we got the same seed is that right it will produce the same thing and I'ma read it to you in just a moment take my shower I don't want no other man I want Yoshi it was a law that if a brother died without giving his wife children well the brother next to the brother could go and lay with her so that woman would have a see y'all hear what I'm saying in other words my brother and I carry the same seed from my daddy y'all and in that side typically Amen of course in the natural you find a little differences in the DNA you might find a little sum that traveled but when God seed is pure nothing at it nothing take it away that's why I said whatever you do with this word don't take away don't add to it the Word of God is pure is it is hallelujah and take my Amen you know I loved tomorrow I really do cuz she was desperate okay mom must have been a beautiful lady cuz Judah fell for Judah had a weakness I said a weakness but God knows my point is seem that God used in God used him if we look from the columbine and Solomon we would say you know someone was sick a thousand wives but God were using him and maybe that's all God needed him far other than ruling Israel people said well he went into a dollar tree God sent him down he did what God said and he may have come short but brother branham's in the message as I was with Moses he said God don't look at your mistakes he look at the Commission and as long as you fulfill the Commission your mistakes means nothing to God hallelujah you shall solve enough to go to hell Sodom Lane inhale Solomon is in heaven on the new year you said well what about saw he went to the witch of all and or don't you know God knew and Solomon was gonna do Dada said oh my goodness solving the messed up Oh what I'm gonna do know God knew what Solomon wanna do he had David already grooming teaching David already before Solomon said David was killing liked it there hallelujah so you got to realize him and guarding just awakened by somebody's mistake he knows you're gonna make a mistake bow before he gave you the Holy Ghost he knew it but here Amen in Genesis 30 12 through 19 amen the Bible said in the process of the time the daughter schewe Judas wife died and Judah

surely he has borne our griefs why would you why you have to bear him if he bore he's carried our sorrows why are you carrying them yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he paid for he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed I'm healed I'm healed hallelujah oh we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way hello there's that will and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all you see what I'm saying he knew that that real would get in the way hallelujah and that we would do things that we knew was wrong which is calling liquid tea hallelujah and his iniquity all of our liqui tea was laid on him amen he was oppressed why are you oppressed and he was afflicted why are you afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is bought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the Shearer is dumb so he opened not his mouth hallelujah what was he was a God secret-agent man hallelujah Amen he was tearing the kingdom that one out just by keeping his mouth shut the devil would have never known who he was hallelujah he didn't know who he was hallelujah even when he got down the hill he still didn't know who he was but I guarantee you once God gave him that punch and kicked him back in a Cell hallelujah he understood he had already met with the wrong man hallelujah ever and then we saw the dead see Jesus raised them going up amen he realized that was the Messiah I had him in my hair and he got away because there was a world that God had spoken they couldn't keep him down cain't no grave I wish I could sing that song ain't no grave hold my body down hallelujah I need Ronald eats pizza here right now hallelujah nobody can sing you like that que no gray hold my body down whoo you got to know how to clap to do that one though oh he was taken from prison and from judgment and who should declare his generation the question was asked who should give brother you own you own it you see who shows because generation God is my feet peel them all over me but most of all I know he's in there oh and he made his grave with the wicked that means I don't have to make my grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done that way I worried about the rich pause he had no pilot and neither was only decedent no deceit in his mouth but there was violence in us there was deceit in us hallelujah but he took it for us come on somebody y'all need to go to Calvary just for the moment and see what he did for you how so you can be appreciative of what he's done hallelujah you know God don't like it when you're not appreciating what he's done God don't like it when you don't believe what he's done hallelujah yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him you know the problem here is that we we got things we don't want to give up when you want to give something up you give it I don't care if it takes you forever to give it up you give it up when you want to give it up and if you love a pleasure more than that shows you your lover pleasure more than God when you don't want to give it up and you know it's wrong you love pleasure more than you love God you need to ask God to help you there yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands is that right he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore when I divide him a portion with the Great and he should divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors foe my last Scripture now he says those things and I'm going to show you the power of the sea because in acts 2 832 38 this is my last Scripture here's this unit reading in Isaiah and he's reading the scripture let me read it to you then the plays of the scripture where he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and that's a lamb done before his Shearer's to open open he not his mouth and in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and that eunuch answered Philip I pray thee of who speaking to prophet this of himself or some other man here was a see a you knock mmm you know it's just no sleep that's all he was but the point is he would see he will see wait a minute they held a revival according brother morality they having a revival and God say Phillip I got somebody you need to go talk to you ah you know what people have a hard time when I feel like a demon is trying to judge trying to challenge me I can't do nothing but I'm gonna tell you something God can when we look at these things and you say oh oh brother Brooks listen here was a unit and as they went on their way they judge now I explained these things to me see what was the declaring his generation so here was this man who didn't know nothing about God or even knew what was happening in Jerusalem or what had happened and God said but he's one of mine and he stopped the revival and said go Philip over here what it feels I don't even know how I'm gonna get there guys they don't worry about it I know chariot and he sees this this angel this fellow walking out of the desert with no chariot he ain't burnt by the Sun he don't look like he's thirsty but he's ready to preach he catches up with the man where God had already worked on the other end where he can easily preach Jesus to it now tell me that if that ain't God see what I'm saying when God needs you he needs you and God would provide away even when Jonah amen wouldn't go to Nineveh he missed his boat and God took away home why cuz nobody could do it like Jonah nobody can take your place you know answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaking the prophets this of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at that same Scripture and preached unto Him Jesus and as they went on their way they came into a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized hallelujah and Philip took a cup and sprinkled him and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou man and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he was baptized one more scripture in closing God's voice always calls his sheep from the big of time the Bible said when then has sinned even in Eden Adam Adam says Lord the Bible said the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening it was the voice of God it said Adam Adam where art thou you understand that's why Jesus said amen he says I am The Good Shepherd and know my sheep and I am known of mine as the father knows me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep right so you understand the voice claims you when you hear the voice you have to follow the voice and you don't doesn't mean you understand why are you following them but something is making you follow him when he went over to Matthew Matthew long knew whoever come come come even the people who said Lord can I follow he says no I have to call you right and you look at these things and you say well what do you mean see that's what the duck voice does in the evening if it did it in the evening of Adam it doesn't and I evening it's always the voice God has a voice and that voice I don't care where you are it's going to find you that voice knew that there will be a woman at the well never have we've heard a man speak like this before but we know that when the Messiah has come eat show well something exploded in her she went to Runyon I don't know honey but you quit your job to follow this man and you don't know who he is I don't know but I know I came here myself is that different from Abraham I heard his voice you mean to tell me you ain't got no image ain't no statue that we can see that can show us what he looked like all I know is I heard his voice and it's a nun in God and I know the one I'm following he is God see that voice will always like even in this age there many people can hear the tapes and never catch because my sheep hear my voice don't get discourage if they can't hear what you hear I don't hear no Kentuckian there's something more powerful than that like I say it's a voice in a voice and you tell me that God don't want you to be saved when God didn't put that same voice in book full of an old tapes he going them farther than he's ever gone in any age to save men hmm and no matter how he tried to shut it down that voice have traveled all over the world America don't have to give it a count for what she's done but in the mystery at all there's still that little remnant that seed of God that refuses to hear someone else's voice oh let me tell you something I know everybody here all cuddled up but let me tell you something I spend my time listening to the prophets voice ain't got no idols and I just don't believe it I just feel like well I ain't gonna you know that but let me say like these people of God you have other choice you and I ought to be so happy it ain't based upon our righteousness the thing that makes me sad is when I make him sad when I know I've done wrong that's what makes me sad but when it comes to my salvation I'm not sad hey you know you know if I woulda coulda no sir I have other sure runs yeah I can't explain it all I know is in my heart that's all I know how it got that Brotherhood I don't know how he put it there brother Babel said if you can explain him he ain't God to you you can't explain God I can't explain why these messages give me joy I can't explain when God quicken things to me to say and I say oh I can't explain it and as I'm saying that I'm earned learning and understanding I can't explain it you say well that ain't right yes it is because you know when it came to the Prophet Robert God had not studied the serpent seed yet while he was on the investigation of somebody kind of critiquing or what was it what was it he said all of a sudden he said that's the serpent that was spontaneous at that hour don't think about what you're gonna say and he said the serpent being God broke it up into him like it were y'all I've never seen him here on the tape he's reading the scripture all of a sudden the revelation bright oh he said yeah that's it that's it fresh fruit fresh anointing fresh revelation to the property himself y'all let's don't listen I don't know but I've seen it I've seen things break to him on the tape and he just oh there it is there it is he had it but he didn't didn't see the scripture for you and that's how it is it's by revelation I can't prove to you that brother Branham is the prophet of this age but I know he is I can go through all the scriptures and maybe you can find out some things about him that discredit his ministry I don't know how you do that but I thought about Billy Graham and I don't mean no harm no disrespect to the man that's a bit of a wedding for brother Branham there wouldn't have been a Billy Graham but nobody mentioned his name it was that prophet that God used to spark the revival in America but nobody mentioned his name you understand me see what it is because we are not in Laodicea they put us out and they didn't understand when they was closing the door to william branham they was closing the door to jesus christ y'all hear me be assured about your salvation stop being wishy-washy and letting the devil teach you all kinds of way you know what i'm going through my my tires too but at the end of the day God brought me back up he just yeah he won't let me stay he just won't let me he's you know I you know I don't he just won't let me stay he keeps giving me joy every time it looked like it it's impossible he makes it possible oh yo y'all know what I'm talking about that's there well I'm gonna mope and groan and you know Behrman complain that's what Israel did and all of that is because of unbelief I can't make you believe you know how can we believe what Satan says and won't believe what God says huh listen listen the man who was born blind thirty years he said I've been blind on I've been blind I never seen so if you've had a demon for thirty years that don't mean you can't be delivered cuz honest is a disease a demon scuse me and he was delivered or I was I'd never seen before so what have you had this that it doesn't make no difference how long word ever been with you or demos you still ain't in the will of God into God God's Word came to deliver I don't care who you are God's Word came to deliver and if till God tell me no I'm not gonna give you that deliverance I'll keep knocking till I'm delivered in making sense there was one lady there in Brenham Tabernacle who never got out of the wheelchair and to be honest with you I don't think she wanted to because that was a testimony that even though I'm crippled I still love the Lord have been prayed for but God never gave it delivers why it was his will that she be there and at the same time he comes in here Upshaw God do it worked with whoever he wants to with people of God one thing for certain you cannot make heaven without faith you can and understand that's what happened to the children Israel they kept Merman they kept complaining kept learning kept complaining and God at one point I'm saying that's enough I wouldn't let no devil in hell make me believe I'm a devil in hell Bauer absolutely not I don't care if I stole something yesterday I'm still the son of God y'all may not understand and I know some of y'all don't understand what I just said but I Know Who I am hallelujah hey and if I was to steal something guess what it would more than likely be food because I'm stealing to be home if I'm hungry y'all homes that's what David said Lord don't make me don't make me so hungry that I gotta steal and they said David knew the man's the heart of a man and don't make me so rich all I forget about you y'all lookin at you know people people you gotta understand you say well like like they sitting and I'm trying to coach they said well George Washington never told a lot brother Brown said I don't believe that hey I don't either I don't know no man who's never he said well I ain't never lie will you just lie everybody lie without the only girl she lie with the Holy Ghost of you ain't careful you a lie you might repent out there was no people of God let's read let's be real before God God love real people only the pure of heart shall see God and you know you gotta call things as they are yeah they don't play with it you know it's what's real what's real and you if you won't deliver you guys it was like I said at the end it's time before Lord delivered me from my Nona no see they no such thing is unknown you know what you're doing if you got any kind of conscious in you you know what you're doing let's pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and your grace Lord we have you blessed us so much and we've got so much to be thankful for Lord we come down to the end of the road lord I know translation is nearby but the question you ask even to your disciples when the Son of Man comes shall he find the faith that's what he's looking for Lord not so much it works that we must do but the faith in him that he can do it and I say to you to the people of God is there anything too hard for God Lord I pray father that you give us grace to die to our will so we can accept your will be merciful now in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen when I think about wheels I think about that widdle woman she could have said to Elijah well you know I ain't giving you no case cuz I really don't want to be a widow and I don't even understand why God you understand me she could have had a bad out of - she didn't why she trusted God he knew you should have a new bed out of - there people in jail save it and ones that lost saved and some of us out here got more God in them than some of us guy yet they locked up in jail telling that we look at them and old Pope fellas they still in jail hey Dana in jail if they got God they free probably more freer than us they trust in God in the prison house but they know if they don't anything could happen and thank you for all of Judah Lord we've seen on how you work within so many times you brought in from a mighty long way the father I pray for now that you love your word love your soul she was submit in your will as we pray father also with all the application father we pray Lord God Oh Mikayla right now she's going to go her life changes father I pray right now she stood here Lord she looked me directly in the eye and she wants your Holy Ghost father you've heard her heart cries all the new young and I pray father God that you filled her with your Holy Ghost wrong it's such a way Lord she'll know it you
