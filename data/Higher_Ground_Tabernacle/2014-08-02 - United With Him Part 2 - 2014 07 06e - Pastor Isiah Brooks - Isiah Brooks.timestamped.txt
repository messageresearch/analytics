[2:20] to Philippians

[2:38] him and and the power of his
[2:41] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[2:44] suffering let me read that again and the
[2:46] fellowship of his suffering being made
[2:49] conformable unto his death if by any
[2:52] means I might obtain until the
[2:55] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[2:59] had already obtain neither were already
[3:02] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[3:06] apprehend that for which also I love
[3:10] this part I am
[3:12] apprehended of Christ
[3:16] Jesus
[3:17] Hallelujah you love the
[3:20] Lord Brethren I count not myself to have
[3:25] apprehended but this one thing I do
[3:28] forgetting those things forgetting those
[3:31] things forgetting those things which are
[3:35] behind and reaching forth unto those
[3:38] things which are before amen I press
[3:41] toward the mark for the prize of the
[3:45] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let
[3:51] us therefore as many as be perfect be
[3:55] thus minded and if in anything ye be
[3:59] otherwise
[4:00] minded God shall reveal even this unto
[4:04] you amen so I showed you this morning
[4:07] that no matter what you stand in need of
[4:09] all your shortcomings whatever it may be
[4:11] wherever things need to be fixed
[4:13] replaced however you want to say it God
[4:16] will reveal it to you if you have a
[4:19] sincere heart let us pray father God we
[4:22] come before you Lord as humbly as we
[4:23] know how we thank you for your grace we
[4:26] thank you for your mercy and Lord you've
[4:28] been so good to us you've been better to
[4:30] us than we've been to ourselves we pray
[4:32] father God once again that you will
[4:34] anoint your servant anoint the people of
[4:36] God hallelujah and God I pray that you
[4:39] walk in our midst we know you're here
[4:42] because you said in your word where two
[4:44] or three are gathered in your name
[4:46] Hallelujah you are in the midst thank
[4:49] you for being here just make yourself
[4:51] known Lord in whatsoever way you choose
[4:54] to in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[4:58] you may be seated
[5:03] amen that word conversation mean
[5:05] lifestyle putting away while putting off
[5:08] the
[5:09] lifestyle the old uh form of the old way
[5:13] of living the old man right amen and you
[5:17] know I asked this question some time ago
[5:20] the scripture says amen that uh old
[5:24] things and all things have passed away
[5:27] behold all things have become new amen
[5:30] now you got to understand that is a
[5:32] state of condition of a True Believer
[5:35] amen that is a death burial and a
[5:39] resurrection amen it is a a a a Old
[5:43] World versus a new one and you must
[5:45] understand that the old world Amen
[5:48] passed away by fire Hallelujah come on
[5:53] Amen if you want to put it this way amen
[5:56] what what do they call it when when they
[5:58] burn you up after you die
[6:01] cremated the old world is cremated by
[6:05] the fire of God and nothing is basically
[6:08] left now brother brandham said it like
[6:10] this he said there can never be a true
[6:12] or a complete nihilation he said all it
[6:15] does is take everything back to its
[6:18] original state amen so we realize by the
[6:22] grace of God that what the fire and see
[6:25] this is where I'm at there are so many
[6:27] people amen that don't seem to
[6:29] understand
[6:30] amen that prophet of God gave us
[6:32] utterance he through God God through him
[6:36] made an entrance according to Peter
[6:39] right an entrance into this holies of
[6:42] holies he showed us how to get there
[6:46] amen and he tried to tell even the
[6:48] Pentecostals of their day you're not
[6:50] there yet in other words if you can't
[6:53] receive all amen all of the word if you
[6:57] can't even receive this portion of the
[6:59] words it proves you either don't have
[7:02] the right holy ghost or you need to get
[7:05] it right he was trying to tell him that
[7:09] God cannot deny his word he wrote it he
[7:14] is the
[7:15] amen hallelujah so wherever the word is
[7:19] speaking we must receive
[7:22] it hello take it and receive it by the
[7:27] grace of God now We Know by by God's
[7:32] grace amen that we we for a long time
[7:35] let's put it this way for a long time we
[7:37] believe there was just justification
[7:39] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[7:41] Ghost that's where the Pentecostal
[7:44] stop they stop at the third phase but
[7:48] this message according to the prophet of
[7:51] our day revealed to us that the baptism
[7:55] of the Holy Ghost only was the fire that
[7:58] would sweep it
[8:00] amen the fire that would cleanse it the
[8:03] fire that would prepare it hello for the
[8:08] uh habitation of God
[8:10] himself and that's where the
[8:12] Pentecostals fail because they had the
[8:15] house cleaned they failed to put Faith
[8:19] there to bring God in and now their
[8:22] state is 7 times worse than the
[8:25] beginning because when you don't allow
[8:28] the Holy Ghost to come in the Unholy
[8:31] ghost will
[8:32] amen Satan will take advantage of the
[8:37] clean house
[8:40] amen now this is why amen we find that
[8:44] there are so many people amen that's now
[8:47] are questioning and wondering and things
[8:50] like that anden you know what it is they
[8:53] fail the Sea Harvest
[8:56] Time every seed must bring forth of it
[8:59] is kind I don't care they can't be
[9:01] nothing that they ain't amen that's it
[9:05] and harvest has come and now the
[9:07] anointing of the age is now
[9:11] bringing into clear view the
[9:15] identification of the seeds that were
[9:18] planted in the
[9:20] garden see however it starts that's how
[9:24] it
[9:26] finishes it start holy it must
[9:30] holy hello amen it starts with the fall
[9:34] and sin it ends with the fall and sin
[9:37] come on it started with the Beast it
[9:42] ends with the
[9:44] Beast huh come on somebody now watch
[9:47] this God even Jesus Christ in his day he
[9:51] tried to show amen the Pharisees I am he
[9:56] right I am the same one a men that was
[10:00] in the
[10:01] bush it was a burning bush but it was a
[10:05] bush of
[10:07] thorns it was it was a bush I'mma prove
[10:10] it to you just a moment it was a bush
[10:12] amen of thistle however you want to put
[10:14] it thorns and thistles that's what the
[10:17] Bible says the Bible says because of
[10:19] your sin thorns and thistles it will
[10:22] bring so Jesus had to be robed in thorns
[10:25] and this oh come on somebody and he put
[10:28] the fire in thorns and thistles amen you
[10:31] said that came yes it is then he proved
[10:34] to Abraham I'm the same God Amen why
[10:37] because the ram was caught in the
[10:39] thistle oh my Hallelujah it didn't stop
[10:43] there he took them all the way up to
[10:45] calary and what did he do he crowned
[10:47] himself Hallelujah the thorn and thisle
[10:50] Crown showing he was the same God the
[10:53] Alpha and the Omega the same God of
[10:55] Jehovah is now robed in Jesus Christ
[11:00] himself they failed to see it
[11:05] though they failed to see it like I said
[11:07] this morning he was the same Rock the
[11:09] water that came out of the rock he told
[11:11] the woman at the well I'm the same water
[11:13] he told all over he that whosoever
[11:15] thirst coming to me I'm the same water
[11:17] amen I might not look like the same Rock
[11:20] but I am the rock hallelujah that's what
[11:23] he said he said I was the one in the
[11:26] wilderness that's what he said so comes
[11:29] along and he does the same
[11:32] thing Hallelujah he he he just throws
[11:35] himself out there to the world so that
[11:37] they could see him but let me tell you
[11:38] something the Bible said that the evil
[11:40] man doesn't they don't like light the
[11:43] children of Darkness don't like light
[11:45] they love Darkness because the light
[11:47] will expose
[11:49] them hello somebody they can run from
[11:52] the light but the light coming anyhow
[11:54] Hallelujah it will identify Who You Are
[11:59] you and I we're blessed you said what
[12:01] brother I'm not where I used I should be
[12:03] you're still blessed like that brother
[12:05] who preached the other week he said yes
[12:07] he said all the apples like one tree he
[12:10] said but all of them ain't at the top of
[12:12] the tree he said the whole tree has
[12:15] apples I'm just using this as a scenario
[12:17] he said they don't all rip them at the
[12:19] same time Hallelujah I don't care if I'm
[12:21] at the bottom of the tree I I'm on the
[12:24] tree and I share
[12:27] riping my time's coming
[12:29] [Music]
[12:33] Hallelujah is that all right so I look
[12:36] at this thing I said if the people could
[12:38] really see one of the things that I was
[12:40] trying to show you is that here
[12:42] something happened there in the Garden
[12:44] of Eden that we missed and that is when
[12:47] a god breathed the breath of life into
[12:50] Adam the Bible said he became a living
[12:53] Soul when God
[12:56] breathed the life into Act
[12:59] Adam Eve was there that's
[13:03] right Hallelujah come on because you
[13:06] remember after God separated Adam or Eve
[13:10] from Adam he never had to breathe into
[13:12] her nostrils why because the fire was
[13:15] already there Hallelujah it was showing
[13:18] amen that the same fire that was
[13:21] breathing to Adam is the same fire that
[13:24] is breathing to the Bride of Jesus
[13:26] Christ Hallelujah that's why the Bible
[13:28] tells tells us amen you got to go to
[13:31] Pentecost Hallelujah that's your day of
[13:34] Jubilee hallelujah oh come on somebody
[13:38] that's your day of
[13:39] Jubilee huh God coming and he promised
[13:43] see that's why brother say you were
[13:45] sealed with the Holy Ghost before the
[13:48] foundation amen hallelujah and he proved
[13:51] that because when he breathed into Adam
[13:53] he was showing that Eve was already she
[13:57] sinned amen but she couldn't be left out
[14:01] cuz the life eternal had already been
[14:03] given come on somebody like I said the
[14:06] sin just broke the relation the
[14:08] fellowship but it never stopped the
[14:10] relationship amen now the Bride of Jesus
[14:13] Christ amen the breach has been restored
[14:16] W come on somebody the breach has been
[14:19] res how do we know we had a Malachi fall
[14:22] that came and show us that the lamb he
[14:25] binded up the brid that means I can
[14:27] fellowship with him whatever I wanted
[14:30] Amen in the morning in the evening in
[14:32] the new time it doesn't matter amen I
[14:35] can fellowship with him all day and
[14:37] guess what he likes
[14:41] it that's the whole purpose of Calvary
[14:44] bringing you and I back to him once
[14:47] again is that all right hallelujah we're
[14:50] not of this world and that's what we've
[14:52] got to come to a reckon we're not of
[14:55] this world Hallelujah when I was shut in
[14:58] I was praying to the Lord Lord I said
[14:59] God I know I'm not a
[15:01] devil I love you too much I may not be
[15:04] able to get live this word like I need
[15:07] to but one thing I do know I am not a
[15:10] serpent amen hallelujah why because in
[15:13] my heart I can repent amen hallelujah
[15:17] and in my heart I desire to do good oh
[15:20] come on somebody that's beyond the
[15:23] serpent he can't repent and he doesn't
[15:25] have a desire to serve God
[15:29] he don't mind being religious but he
[15:31] don't have desire to really serve him
[15:34] cuz if that be the truth came would have
[15:35] say yes Lord I do what you say because I
[15:37] desire to serve
[15:39] you y'all hear what I'm
[15:42] saying listen and Judas he turned his
[15:46] back on God and he couldn't have gone to
[15:48] Pentecost if he wanted to it wasn't in
[15:52] him y'all hear what I'm saying he it
[15:55] wasn't in it and let let me put it this
[15:57] way if you desire and thirsting after
[15:59] the righteousness you just keep Desiring
[16:02] and you keep thirsting and God promis
[16:04] you shall be filled now you say what it
[16:07] mean when in time God has his appointed
[16:10] time Amen to do his work in you I love
[16:14] that I love that and I'm not going to
[16:16] get discouraged amen because I'm not
[16:18] where I should be let me take oh I'm
[16:20] preaching to something different now but
[16:21] let me put it this way you got to
[16:23] recognize that you brother B said the
[16:25] bride in of Jesus Christ in this day
[16:27] came to be what
[16:29] tested tested and
[16:33] tried Hallelujah that means you going to
[16:37] have
[16:38] trouble but you ought to say hallelujah
[16:40] anyhow
[16:44] amen you can't get out of that it's
[16:46] going to happen Hallelujah but we're
[16:49] like Peter I ain't going nowhere right
[16:51] brother rich I ain't going nowhere
[16:53] Hallelujah if I can't taste see smell or
[16:55] hear you I'm still not going nowhere cuz
[16:59] I know you're the
[17:00] Messiah amen come on I wonder I said
[17:04] Lord how can it be the Messiah has come
[17:06] in this day come on you might not want
[17:08] to say this but when William Brandon was
[17:10] on the scene that was the Messiah amen
[17:15] y'all y'all act like y'all listen I
[17:17] don't know about you but I'm a messiah
[17:19] amen that what he told me I'm a messiah
[17:23] Hallelujah I'm not talking about the
[17:25] Flesh of William Brown I'm talking about
[17:27] the Shina of Glory that was in
[17:29] and the same kind of Glory that was in
[17:31] him is in
[17:32] me
[17:34] Hallelujah ah brother brand said what
[17:37] did God do God took took the that that
[17:39] that big pile of that big old fire he
[17:41] said all he did was a rotate a part of
[17:44] himself all into you took a part of
[17:46] himself and put it into you you don't
[17:49] see that that same fire that was in the
[17:52] bush came down on the day of Pentecost
[17:54] and broke up
[17:56] Hallelujah into 120 peie is the same
[18:02] fire showing that God knows how to
[18:06] produce
[18:07] children Hallelujah he couldn't put
[18:10] somebody else's fire in there he had to
[18:12] put his own fire because the fire itself
[18:15] was a very life of
[18:19] himself is that
[18:21] okay that's why the the devil don't want
[18:23] you to get the real Holy Ghost he don't
[18:26] mind you being religious and he don't
[18:28] mind comeing to church and he don't mind
[18:30] amen you sitting around this message
[18:32] amen say well praise God we got it well
[18:34] that's the Pharisees they did say the
[18:36] same thing and listen you couldn't touch
[18:38] their lives when it came to
[18:39] marrow
[18:41] Hallelujah at least some of them but
[18:43] anyhow amen we realize by the grace of
[18:47] God they God was trying to tell them you
[18:49] don't have it
[18:51] yet you don't have it yet right he comes
[18:55] along here come a Rich Young Ruler he
[18:57] said listen I've I've been studying I
[18:59] I've I've been going to church I've done
[19:00] all these things but what must I do to
[19:02] inherit the Kingdom see he understood
[19:05] there was something in him that made him
[19:08] feel out of all he had done
[19:11] incomplete he wasn't there yet so he
[19:13] understood he said good Master Jesus
[19:16] said unto them don't call me good
[19:17] there's only one good and that's God so
[19:19] basically the Rich Young Ruler was
[19:22] saying
[19:25] God he didn't because the rich run ruler
[19:27] never corrected Jesus Jesus said oh
[19:29] excuse me Lord forgive me he didn't say
[19:32] that so he left it that way so he was
[19:34] really saying I see you as God now what
[19:37] must I
[19:39] do same question we come to church and
[19:41] we ask God what must I do to inherit to
[19:46] go all the way with you he say sell all
[19:48] you have
[19:50] amen see the whole point is selling all
[19:54] that you got and follow me
[19:57] amen the Bible said he walked away
[19:59] Grievous because he could not sell out
[20:02] all that he had and I really believe
[20:05] like brother R said he was a minister
[20:07] God was calling him to the ministry you
[20:10] say what do you mean he told Legion you
[20:11] can't follow
[20:13] me right Legion you go and testify but
[20:16] you can't follow me right come on but
[20:18] here is a man Jesus said come follow me
[20:22] he was literally calling him to the
[20:23] ministry oh my think about it and that
[20:28] same gift called out out of the region
[20:30] of the Lost Lord let me go evangelize my
[20:34] family I don't want them to come to this
[20:36] place and Jesus said it won't matter
[20:38] even if one would raised from the dead
[20:40] they still wouldn't hear him so what was
[20:43] Jesus saying there's going to come a
[20:44] resurrection and your brothers are going
[20:46] to hear it and they still won't believe
[20:49] it so there is no end to what's going to
[20:52] happen because they coming the same way
[20:53] you
[20:55] coming y'all hear what I'm saying so we
[20:58] look at the thing oh brother Brooks how
[21:00] is it that God is showing to you and I
[21:04] that the same light that was in Adam the
[21:07] first Adam the same life that's why
[21:09] people say well oh brother I don't
[21:11] understand what what do you don't
[21:13] understand when God they pierced him
[21:15] watch this now they pierced him in the
[21:18] side on Calvary and out of his side
[21:20] comes what blood and water
[21:25] amen why Blood and water Hallelujah
[21:29] because he was signifying I am the
[21:33] water the same water amen that I gave to
[21:37] you it wasn't just a bride coming out it
[21:40] was actually signifying who he was as
[21:42] well amen that he was the blood and the
[21:45] water the light come by both amen what
[21:49] do you mean brother Brooks the blood was
[21:52] shed before the foundation of the world
[21:55] Amen now we do what live by the water of
[21:59] the
[22:06] word sure it was the bride in tight
[22:09] because she comes by the blood she oh
[22:12] come on she overcomes by the blood
[22:15] Hallelujah but she drinks from the well
[22:18] that never runs dry Hallelujah y'all
[22:22] getting quiet on me now that's all right
[22:25] amen we realize amen that same God Jesus
[22:29] Christ in flesh was the almighty God and
[22:32] he couldn't do nothing but show his
[22:37] substance he showed his substance amen
[22:40] that's why brother B said now listen he
[22:42] said if you even had a little bottle of
[22:44] blood chemistry Jesus it wouldn't do you
[22:47] any good because what did God do he hid
[22:51] himself in the cells of that blood
[22:54] Hallelujah come on somebody and so when
[22:57] that op operation was done by a Roman

[28:32] fire on the inside of you because that
[28:35] pill of fire cannot lose a battle it
[28:38] will win every
[28:42] battle when brother Brandon was standing
[28:44] in the pool pit what was he doing trying
[28:47] he wasn't trying to muster up his own
[28:49] mus muscles to do something he said I'm
[28:50] waiting on him why cuz he realized I

[28:56] carnal here it's spiritual Hallelujah
[28:58] with the pulling down of strongholds
[29:00] Hallelujah putting Satan under my feet
[29:03] he said hey I can't I'm waiting on him

[29:07] Warrior when God stepped on the scene he
[29:09] said he's here you can hear the change
[29:12] in His Voice Hallelujah why because he
[29:15] realized the battle has already been
[29:17] fought and the Victory is already won
[29:19] Hallelujah every demon in this house got
[29:21] to go but he told the people he said now
[29:24] listen he said this atmosphere must be
[29:27] an atmosphere of fth Fai he said because
[29:29] unbelief drives him away you got to
[29:32] believe that God is
[29:34] God I'm not even on my notes yet he said
[29:37] you got to believe that God is God huh
[29:41] God is God greater is he that is in you
[29:45] than he that is in the
[29:51] world let me say it like this that woman
[29:54] at the well hadn't even gone to
[29:56] Pentecost yet and she had
[30:00] Joy Hallelujah when she heard he was the
[30:03] Messiah the Bible say she dropped apart
[30:06] ran into the City come see a man she
[30:09] didn't have the Holy Ghost

[30:16] Holy Ghost to have joy when that
[30:18] Revelation strike you Hallelujah come on
[30:20] somebody it brings a stimulation
[30:23] Hallelujah you can't even help

[30:29] Bible called according to Colossians 3
[30:32] says 1-4 if ye then be risen with Christ
[30:36] seek those things which are from above
[30:39] above right where Christ sth on the
[30:42] right hand of God set your affection on
[30:45] things above and not on things of the
[30:46] Earth for ye are dead and your life is
[30:50] what hid with Christ in God like I said
[30:54] just like Eve was in Adam at the first
[30:57] that's the way God wants our lives so he
[30:59] in him nobody can see us they see Christ
[31:03] is that the word that's what Jesus said
[31:06] he said when you see me you see the
[31:11] father Hallelujah when you see me you

[31:27] you you and me you know you know how the
[31:29] scripture go according to St John 17
[31:31] they became one and all Jesus Christ was
[31:35] interested in is that you see the father
[31:38] work because brother BR said God Jesus
[31:41] never healed
[31:42] anyone that's what he said Jesus never
[31:45] healed he it was God oh Lord the man
[31:49] never healed it was the god in the
[31:53] man whatever I see the father do that's
[31:56] what I he the that's what I do hether to
[31:57] to right that's what he did and that's
[32:00] how if he operated that way that's how
[32:03] we operate Hallelujah we can't just say

[32:09] him oh come on

[32:38] amnesia we forgot where we came from we
[32:41] forgot who we are sin brought these

[33:50] him coming and you know what he runs out
[33:52] the house to grab his son and you know
[33:54] what he says I knew you would return

[34:10] knew you would return that wasn't just a
[34:13] story brother B was giv us a parable
[34:15] that we could see
[34:18] ourselves that's the way I look at the

[34:24] pick it
[34:26] up h Hallelujah ain't God good oh my
[34:30] goodness I love the Lord listen how is
[34:33] it
[34:34] listen in the message look he says where
[34:37] a man confess when a man confess his
[34:39] sins and get right with God and God
[34:43] drops the sin of this its confession
[34:47] into the blood of his own blood blood
[34:51] and forgives that sin and and replaces
[34:54] in the man listen what he said and then
[34:56] God replaces in the man the original
[35:01] spirit that should have been
[35:04] there
[35:06] huh he gives you the holy ghost that
[35:08] should have been there all along come on
[35:11] somebody his own Spirit making him a Son
[35:15] of God how much more
[35:17] ought the creative power of God to be in
[35:21] the church see it breaks down every wall
[35:27] of of
[35:29] sin it breaks down now listen he goes on
[35:34] to say in the word god hidden himself in
[35:38] Simplicity that there's no more nothing
[35:41] talking about Sin when the Holy Ghost
[35:42] come he he disperses everything no more
[35:46] sin he says that the complete word of
[35:49] God rests within them that the very
[35:53] command of their own Voice Hallelujah
[35:56] the very command of their own voice is
[35:59] creative
[36:02] power because in them is the Holy Ghost
[36:06] and the Holy Ghost is a Creator he makes
[36:10] things come to pass because he speaks
[36:13] the word and the word spoken become God
[36:17] In
[36:21] Action maybe I'm the only one but that
[36:24] was some good
[36:25] wine that was some good
[36:28] wine oh my is that all right Ephesians
[36:32] 6:12 says we ring not against flesh and
[36:34] blood but against flesh I'm Excuse me we
[36:37] wrest not against flesh and blood but
[36:39] against principalities against Powers
[36:42] against the rulers of the darkness of
[36:44] this world against spiritual wickedness
[36:46] in high places you know why why I look
[36:49] at this thing and you know this ain't a
[36:51] practice rehearsal this is real war and
[36:54] God threw you out there because he knew
[36:56] exactly what you capable of doing with
[36:59] his holy ghost is that all right listen
[37:02] and only only listen if you if you if
[37:06] let me put this way he will not allow
[37:08] you to be a failure in this world

[37:56] little message I was going to tie into
[37:57] but I I put this way God has been good
[38:01] to us he's given us the Holy Ghost now
[38:04] there's a many people who got the Holy
[38:06] Ghost and is not using it is that right
[38:09] I think was brother Randy reminded me
[38:10] it's just like having a gun and for
[38:13] hunting and you won't even hunt you just
[38:14] got the gun up on the Shelf what the gun
[38:17] is for you don't buy a gun to look at oh

[38:27] you need you need to you're going to use
[38:29] that gun to do what kill some
[38:36] Beast y'all hear what I'm saying so my
[38:39] point is this you got the Holy Ghost
[38:42] using if you say and you know you really
[38:45] got it God help me show me how amen the
[38:50] gun done been up there so long I don't
[38:51] know how it works I I may maybe I hadn't
[38:54] shot uh used a gun in a long time my aim
[38:57] is not straight you know what I mean
[38:59] amen so you need to say God help me I've
[39:02] got an enemy out here that seem to be
[39:06] rampant and he's tearing up my
[39:09] family y'all be y'all better become
[39:12] Abraham be like Abraham I love Abraham I
[39:15] I I love Abraham I I was going to use my
[39:18] staff this morning I I didn't get a
[39:19] chance I'm G use it
[39:23] now oh Abraham come up there and says
[39:26] hey I might not be too too much of a man
[39:28] to look like but ain't no way go nobody
[39:30] going to take my my grandson from my I'm
[39:33] going out the
[39:36] lot say y'all get y'all RS in y'all
[39:40] hoes oh I love it I love it I love it
[39:44] one thing your son taught me today and I
[39:46] really believe that cuz when I brought
[39:47] the staff out he says no he said that
[39:50] that's not like Moses staff he said
[39:51] Moses staff was taller than him because
[39:53] God is taller than than Moses
[39:57] said I didn't know that I said you're
[39:58] probably right I said I never thought
[40:00] about it Moses had probably a staff like
[40:02] that to make sure you know that the word
[40:05] is taller than you
[40:07] Moses amen oh I like that I'm going to
[40:10] use it too I'm using it
[40:14] now oh my yes yes little Jonathan he
[40:18] fascinates me I love him but you know I
[40:20] look at it and I says Lord I said here
[40:22] we are you got to realize that's true I
[40:24] like that it's got to be right cuz the
[40:26] word is bigger than
[40:29] us amen the word is bigger than us and
[40:32] if we can see that we can realize and
[40:35] this is one of the greatest Revelations
[40:36] you and I could ever
[40:38] receive the word is God that now I know
[40:43] oh I know that the scripture says St
[40:46] John 1:1 but a lot of people have it
[40:48] here they'll have it here because when
[40:50] the word is God you speak it it
[40:55] become the only potent
[40:58] in other words Satan has no power when
[41:02] you realize the word spoken is God am I
[41:06] making sense that and it will not come
[41:09] back void he gave that to us whatsoever
[41:13] you ask in my name believing that you
[41:16] shall receive
[41:17] it is yours that's his words so when you
[41:22] ask for
[41:23] something and you believe it's yours
[41:27] why can't we receive it because we fail
[41:30] to see we spoke
[41:32] God only unbelief can can make the word
[41:36] of God of none
[41:38] effect hello but when faith is applied
[41:42] he said you can say to a mountain be thy
[41:44] move and it shall be done he didn't say
[41:47] it was in a in a day did he y'all
[41:50] remember the trial message brother
[41:51] Brandon preacher he said God never put a
[41:53] time element to it you shall over come
[41:57] he didn't say
[41:58] we come
[42:01] on and this is what I I say to the
[42:04] people I said all you got to do is speak
[42:06] it and believe it and I don't care oh my
[42:09] when I was in prayer the Lord said said
[42:12] to me he said just like I told show show
[42:15] showed Abraham he was going to have a
[42:17] son and no matter he long he he waited a
[42:19] long time he said I gave you your
[42:25] children I gave you your children
[42:27] children and you wait on it hey let me
[42:31] tell you talking about a c a crying
[42:33] spell I had me a good one Hallelujah I

[42:44] oh it made the difference of the in the
[42:46] world I I can't even tell you how I'm
[42:48] feeling but let me say it like this
[42:50] people of God the word is God that was
[42:53] one thing brother brandham recognized
[42:56] the word is God
[42:57] and when he preached he understood that
[43:00] was the word he said but when there was
[43:02] a thust say the Lord it ain't you ain't
[43:05] got nothing to do with it it's going to
[43:07] happen just like he said cuz that was
[43:10] truly God speaking himself y'all hear
[43:13] what I'm saying amen and I want to tell
[43:15] you something whether you believe this
[43:17] or not this whole Bible is thus sayth

[47:10] Childhood Days anybody know what I'm
[47:12] talking about s Satan fights me oh my
[47:15] hallelujah how many dreams I had before
[47:18] I before I got
[47:20] saved I used to dream they they put me
[47:23] in the coffin I can hear
[47:25] them I can't resp spond they putting the
[47:28] dirt on me I can't get
[47:30] out you know that's a horrible
[47:33] nightmare but since I got saved I've not
[47:36] have had a dream like that since amen
[47:38] come on a dream am man you falling off a
[47:41] cliff and you know you're going to hit
[47:42] something somewhere sometime and
[47:45] everything is dark what was God showing
[47:46] me you lost
[47:48] boy you just good as
[47:50] dead you can't stay here right and then
[47:54] God quickened me now I'm in the
[47:58] light I'm in the
[48:01] light let me say in closing I keep
[48:04] saying that I don't mean to lie I'm
[48:06] trying to tell the truth here in closing
[48:09] let me say it like this if you don't
[48:11] have the faith to be healed or delivered
[48:14] that's what you do you ask God
[48:18] for that's what James
[48:20] says he'll give you Faith he won't even
[48:23] upgrade it he give it to you he won't
[48:24] hinder he won't hide nothing he said if
[48:26] you don't have it ask God you keep
[48:28] asking God I need it I want to be lived
[48:30] I I don't have it yet help help my
[48:32] unbelief come on somebody don't be
[48:35] ashamed because God know whether you
[48:36] have faith or not and it's not wrong
[48:39] with you you know where the the the
[48:41] where the supply is and you you're too
[48:43] too proud to ask him for it let me tell
[48:46] you something I'm
[48:47] not so you keep asking God give me the
[48:51] faith to deliver me to overcome this if
[48:54] I've got the faith to overcome show me
[48:56] how to put it in
[48:58] force right now I'm talking about any
[49:01] and everything Deliverance whatever you
[49:02] might need is already there but a lot of
[49:05] time we don't go to the instruction
[49:09] instructor right for the
[49:12] instruction at least the disciples said
[49:15] Lord help the the man who was being
[49:16] healed said Lord help my
[49:21] unbelief and that's what we do sometime
[49:25] it's not even unbelief
[49:27] sometime you're just being
[49:30] tested are you going to serve God
[49:33] anyhow what you going to do with it you
[49:36] know I don't think Lazarus when he
[49:37] raised up from the dead he had an
[49:39] argument with Jesus why'd you let me die
[49:43] huh you let me lay up in that tomb four
[49:45] days
[49:46] rotted I don't think he had an argument
[49:49] he was so glad to be alive he didn't
[49:50] know what to
[49:52] do right and let me tell you something
[49:55] when God quickens you and bring from
[49:57] from Death to life you going to have
[49:59] somebody upset with you because remember
[50:03] when Lazarus was raised from the dead
[50:05] there were people who was upset cuz he
[50:07] was sitting around the table eating with
[50:11] Jesus now that's how it is and I realize
[50:16] today we've got the greatest Octillery
