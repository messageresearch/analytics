TRANSCRIPT
========================================
based on the living thoughts in a living book like I don't want to kind of do another is that part one two or three I'm not sure but I just wanted minister on that again I'm working on another lesson and and I I'm sure God is going to do something with that but I think he's a little more it's too premature two brains at night so I just want to kind of finish up on that or do something so that you can see by God's grace how important it is for us to protect our thoughts amen proverbs 23 and 7 and then we'll go to Philippians 2:5 proverbs 23 and 7 we had a wonderful time there in Columbia South Carolina God really outpoured the Holy Spirit like in the old-fashioned way it was just amazing how how everybody went away blessed they were healings deliverance is I and if I had to judge it it would have been the greatest of all the ten meetings I've been to down south so we appreciate God for His goodness and His grace has been good to us and that's why Satan caused me to lose my phone he's trying to agitate me but that's okay he has to do what he has to do and I've got to do what I've got to did Psalms 23 and 7 it says for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink say that he to thee but his heart is not with it just shows a man hypocritical man Philippians please Philippians 2 and 5 he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you Father God for those who have come out to the house of God Lord we don't know where the others are but I pray that you're keeping them safe and sound no hurt harm or danger come upon them god we don't know but you know you are the God the God who knows all things and all things work together for the good of them that love you Lord bless us tonight as we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I wanted to kind of think teach on by God's grace once again thoughts and just thinking about what the Word of God says about us one of the things that I know by God's grace is that we don't really meditate on God we don't take that word and really think about it like we ought to and I think by God's grace if we can rely we realize Amen that there is as there's only two ways of anything and that is the right way in the wrong way and most of the time it the way that we do things is is our way against God's Way and you know the prophet of God says you can't be in your way in God's way at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get in God's Way and you've got to get out of your own way to get in God's Way for as long as you're in your own way you out of his way so forsake your ways forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely one thing on one thing and that is thus saith the Lord that's all see and when we you began to see how the prophet of God comes along he's trying to get us to see that we're not here to add to God we're not here to think in our own way to to establish righteousness or holiness everything that we are here for is to say amen to God is the one who establishes all righteousness I thought about it and this was one of the things that I learned even while I was there in Colombia how that God you know I've been really stressing you know the labor to enter into your it's a rest and and but there's another angle to laboring and laboring you know I thought well you know just pushing it you know forcefully making it happen but then the Lord revealed to me by some someone saying you know no it's like yielding the laborer is a yielding it's not like in my mind I pictured it because when God gave me the Holy Ghost you know I didn't have to labor what it was I yielded and as soon as that individual said what they said I thought that's it because yielding is getting yourself out of the way and when you yield to God because God is a gentleman you don't have to you know forcibly try to make it happen and I thought Lord that is so real to me it is so true to me and I thought to myself my approach is Lord I surrender Lord I surrender until everything is surrendered rendered amen and I thought about it by God's grace you know the only way that you and I will establish or come to a place where where God is glorified is that we come to a place where amen we began to really meditate on the world if you don't know the word then how do you know how to yield or what to yield to see you've got to know the Word of God it you got missing Joshua said in the book of Joshua now I love this it says the book of the law should not depart out of thy mouth and I'm gonna get into some thoughts in just a moment but thou shalt meditate therein day and night and thou that thou made observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success is that right have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither dog dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee whithersoever thou goest now that takes a mint yielding to the Lord you may not feel him you may not taste it you may not see him you know but you know that the Lord is there how do you know because he said I will never leave you nor will I forsake you so when we realize Amen that God is there we must understand it like I said there's only two way of thinking good or evil right and remember I preached the last time God said you make the tree good or you're making evil he gives you a choice he don't even he doesn't give us this lukewarm stage of life good and evil he said make it good or make it evil amen but how are we going to do that without yielding to the one who can make it good see because the Bible tells us that no man can add one cubit to a statue hallelujah but listen it's a power behind Lord not my will but thine be done it's a power behind that because remember I said last time I ministered that one portion of the Our Father prayer let that will be done in earth as it is in heaven and the Holy Ghost keeps them in heaven so the Holy Ghost real and true holy ghost has the power to keep us in earth see but the word l ET let that's yielding let God have his way let go and let God see so we must understand that we have a battle the greatest battle according to the prophet of God the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind and you and I it is a battle anybody anybody says not it is a battle but we do not want to yield to the bad voice you become a house of thoughts I'm gonna say that again you become a house of thoughts and God wants you only to be a tabernacle or a house of thought that thoughts thought right because you remember I told you that in the beginning Adam and Eve was a house of thought they had only one thought and that thought was whatever God thought it wasn't a maybe they had several choices even though God gave him the choice God said the day that you eat of this tree so they knew to stay with God thought to eat of this tree is a bad thing right when that bad thing became good a good thing that's when they messed up so is it in our day Satan can't get us to do anything bad until he makes it look good think about it that's the truth the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life he can't get us to do it neither these until it becomes pleasing in the eyes see but it's not eyes here he's our heart when in our heart we began to desire or to see it looking good that's when we become that's when Satan has blinded us like he blinded me now says meditators and but be strong Bistro in other words how can I say it y'all know the battle when we talk about yielding you got two voices coming at you do it don't do it do it don't do it you know and you got those losses but he saying be strong in the sense of yielding to the right voice be strong in that bless it because I want you to understand what you hear will affect you as I said I think I said the last time I was here you know when when when II Eve is one she's a woman and a woman loves to hear things you can buy all kinds of stuff and she won't ever be satisfied until you hear her he she hear you say I love you honey oh you're so sweet you just you're beautiful right Caesar that's how the serpent seduced her he seduced her by words now we go by sight right what the man see is what deceives him but because he's not so easily deceived by words but as the church as a bride of Christ or as a Christian being that we are in the feminine agenda you got men you have two men you got the devlins and in God and they're both saying words to you right and those words are going to get next to you one way or the other oh it's the truth nice for example let's use the example the devil come to a woman says oh girl you know you look good but if you put a little bit of that makeup on you're gonna really look sweet right so he seduce her with those nice words and she falls for it right that's how it is with the church that's how it is with preachers they make it all sound good and while they making it all sound good she is wound into her his presence hallelujah leaving the right for the wrong absolutely blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in the Lord of the meditate day and night now you got to understand that we're working with thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you don't even know what's in a man's heart until he acts only he either say it or he moves in his motions like the Bible said is not that thing that goes in that defiles a man and what is what come out that defiles him see so I thought you said what do you mean brother looks everything that you receive is of he's of God or the devil by way of thought you said well I heard the devil you heard a thought right and understand when when thoughts comes into your mind it's a picture with it for example amen when the Scylla goes before the white throne judgment the Bible said as a man thinketh and every idle word when you see a word you're not going to see you know the word fornication you're going to see the very individual in motion where he did it it whether it be in heart or whether it be you know whether it be in the spirit or whether it be in the flesh because that's what a movie is when we get to heaven in the white throne judgment we're not going to hear radio we're gonna see television and that television will have sound to it and as we think in our heart that those words are those thoughts produces pictures yummy so understand by God's grace as we think in our heart God just don't hear words he sees the picture that's what Jesus said him in lust thinks in lust in his heart he's already committed see it's a picture now you and I must understand Amen that God's Word is so important it is our very defence and we want the thoughts of God to be in us well what do you mean brother books so that you understand a word thought it originated as a thought and the thought comes from either God or the devil Lucifer thought in his heart right and with that thought he influenced the third of the angels to follow him and how in what way did they follow him by allowing themselves to think outside of the will of God and when they began to think out of the will of God they themselves or defile and they fell with Lucifer hallelujah so is it with us when we began to think outside of the Word of God we fall and defiled ourselves that's the way it is they've seen it on the commercials all the other little TVs amen when you know the little cartoon either got a angel the Lord ain't just standing on what right side and the devil on the other and they're fussing with one another that's a reality because a thought is a person hello because we don't see Satan but you say the devil said the devil made right because he's injecting his thoughts into your mind into your spirit right this is it hi and my word i won well the devil in his word is one you see so you and I must understand that's what he said in the old days a man is judged his characters judged by his words back in the day a man stood with his word stood if I said it was whatever that seals it because that man and his word was the same see so you got to understand that when there are inspirations of thoughts coming in your mind there is a person standing there whether it be the devil or whether it be demons but they're they're talking to you as if it's the same way the Holy Ghost comes and talk to you and when the Holy Ghost when you say oh the Lord said to me or the Lord told me you talk about a person yeah it came into your heart and your spirit as a thought you see them saying there's only to wait like I said before Lucifer fell they all had to thought some God whatever God wanted them to do that's what they do did if God say holy holy holy that's what they did if God said bow they bow and God is a spirit so they proceeded they heard God in their spirit and they obeyed God but it was just as good as a word hmm when you being led by the Spirit what you say what you say God I heard you say come follow me right it's something that moves you you're hearing something in your spirit and you're moving by that spirit is that okay see so you must understand that the only thing that is going to protect us from spiritual attacks when people say things against you when people do wrong against you understand like brother Ram said make excuses for them he said that is the devil right it's not your brother it's the influence of the devil it is his words his thoughts that he have injected in them and therefore now they're walking according to the thoughts of the devil right when Peter said Lord you'll not be crucified Jesus surely says Satan he wasn't talking to Peter he wasn't calling Peter Satan but he recognized the thought and where it originated from and he addressed that issue see them saying so when your brother and your sister say things to you that's contrary to the Word of God because the Bible said blessed and cursed not so somebody say something negative you and I'm trying to apply that to you well you know that didn't come from God it came from devil from the devil so what happens you you you don't you don't look and sayd like Jesus Satan get behind me unless you in trouble you want to fight a million but you recognize the devil listen what the Bible tells us there in Psalms 119 23 Prince's are also also did sit and speak against me but thy servant did meditate in that statue in other words when words of offense come when the devil comes and he brings things to you by way of individuals yo yo yo defense is not the gossip or the talk or go around I'm guilty anybody guilty or to say what we shouldn't say but your defense is to hurry get behind the word meditate on the positive things like I am blessed no man can curse me write words that will will will build up a standard and block that negative atmosphere from penetrating into your spirit see so you and I must understand even if it just testimonies that's what the Bible says that testimony is also a my delight and my counselor so I've got testimonies that you're with me and if God before you no man can be against you right so you and I we're dealing with spirits we're dealing with inspiration and when you know that these inspirations are not coming from God you do not allow these things to penetrate you because otherwise you're allowing that devil that's coming from the individual to come down and anoint you in the same way right and all of a sudden you began to say something back and what has happened now both of you need to repent and both of you need need the devil to be exorcised all right because we are we are the Living Word of God this see people to all the raptures coming where the rapture can take place cannot take place until the rod coming them Christ which is the it's manifested and she's manifested by what his thoughts she's emptied all of her thoughts out and now she's going back to one thought that one single singleness of mind and that's what the gut the Holy Spirit is requiring of the church they have singleness of mine not to be a double-minded church or double minded people have one purpose and that is to glorify God to produce God to manifest God to declare God everything is about declaring Jesus Christ not ourselves there are no great ones among us whenever you think there's a great one as a person you think you're a great one among those you are fallen you are anointed by the devil it's the truth those you got to understand whatever man is thinking that's why I had to come repent about the camera and all that stuff because even for a moment I was anointed it sounded like a joke but a spirit that came from a spirit didn't come from the Holy Ghost so if it wasn't from the Holy Ghost it came from the devil and if you got a recognize an individual that when you when you speak or say something that's contrary to the word is that right the Bible said Jesus made of himself no reputation so when you find an individual whoever it may be trying to establish a reputation that is not of God here the God of all heaven and earth the Bible said he humbled himself like a man and became a servant he wasn't looking for reputation hallelujah he was so humble they didn't even see him they didn't even know him Judas had to portray him by kids see you got to understand that our thoughts is in the spiritual realm you can't see it you can't feel it you can't taste them yet they are just as real probably more real than the things that we see in touch thoughts are tangible to the mind right because thoughts you know I can say faint operates in that way fake all those things that be not as though they were and we can get the thoughts of God in us like with these stripes we are healed your thoughts not based upon your feelings but his thoughts says we are healed nothing can withstand that absolutely but if you got a double mind about it a man that's good and evil make the good tree good or make it evil right he's talking about you and me you and I have a charge we can make the tree good or we can make it evil but when is good and evil it's got to go that that is not what God is looking for in this hour he's looking for the good tree and the good tree is the tree of life and in the Tree of Life there are no there is no death right so you so oh that's why the Bible said cast down every thought that exalts itself against the word ha because you will become it whatever that thought is that exalted self against the word Lucifer said I will a sin did he not the very thing he said he became now Lucifer which we call Satan is the god of this evil age right see and the thing about it people of God it's like is like this when you think when you catch the mind of God that's why we need to meditate we need to take that word of God and apply to ourselves God this word is me I was trying to tell the people of God this I said this Bible is you because you are the thoughts and attributes of God but you and I have come to be made manifest what Oh God didn't send me to say Oh Isaiah brushes now hit the earth that's not my purpose my purpose is to reflect the light and thought of God for my day so are you we're here to respect the life the light right the Bible said in the beginning was well uh yeah let me say it like the hard st. John says that that word let me read it let me read it it's right there in front of us you know we look at this thing and we shall oh the light was the light was the light life of me I like that I like that because it says it Word was made flesh and that light was what the light of men in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God right in him the fourth first jumping down in him was life and the life was the light of live right the light in a number one light the revelation that was in Christ that life that light what was in Christ was the life of me it was the revelation of what men are to be we never knew as you heard me say previously you and I have never known what a real man supposed to be like but Jesus Christ reflected what the life of man supposed to be right because he had the thought of God the Bible said he had the mind of God he thought it not robbery to be equal with him so people of God the Bride of Christ must meditate on the world and you and I must come to a place that we do not think that we robbing God by being equal is that the word because he poured himself into us there's not a lesser God maybe you got a smaller portion but you are just as potent as the God of heaven as long as we think I said to be less see you and I have been born-again those of us who have been sealed with all the ghosts you are the Living Word of God the very thought of God manifested in what we call this evil age and so we are and we must carry ourselves like that not trying to find a reputation not trying to be a big guy a great God but to keep humble before God so that when God wants to use us he can use us and we won't be afraid when you think okay listen what it says cast down every thought that exalt what it self self is a character it's a person itself so there itself against every thought that exalts itself so the thought comes from some self somebody someone and that someone is the devil the same one that whispered and Eve's ear is still whispering in the ears of Lee right so whatever the devil brings to you that is against God you must put it under your feet ooh thoughts can be powerful how do they come from one brother rich you know he I was thinking about that the other day and I really said something to you know why do we have airplane pilots and everybody can't be one why do we have engineers and everybody can't be engineers why do we have painters and artists and everything everybody can't be the same thing but God put all of these gifts and individuals and these individuals had to believe they could be it you understand me they had to believe that they could be it and then God took all these things together to what produce his thought to make sure his word comes to pass is that right also true somebody had to make the car cuz the Prophet said there was a chariot they didn't have horses somebody had to produce amen the plane right somebody had to mechanically go into the science of making planes because Israel had to fly back on the eagle see all of these things and and you know I can't make no plate I don't even know how to begin I don't even know how this up had work more or less but somebody had to do all of this why because the Bible says in the last day knowledge will increase hallelujah see all these things have to seeing in all that because you said all the whole I saw those two prophets without satellite without these things that we're not experiencing and then they would have been in a way that we the world would have seen Moses and Elijah laying in the street see so all of these things had to be and you say what do you mean those were the thoughts of God if those spots are so real and in an engineer found his place a painter found his place in that a mathematician found his place how can the bride not find her place and where is her place he said if you overcome I will grant with you to sit in my throne even as I have said in my father's song Jesus praying said father I would the baby one even as we hallelujah that word it's a thought of God that we would be one with him he's not my thought is his star I receive it hallelujah I wanted hallelujah help me give Jesus to yield amen to that thought that I will become one with you that's how powerful thoughts are because those thoughts becomes words and those words amen on what we're feeding on but you'll never understand what these words are unto you many man it meditate on it the word when he says my word they are spirit so then this thing on the page must become spirit to you all over again that's where the revelation is where do they come from as I said Ebola good yes the truth right you know seed I said say there was a tree of knowledge of good and evil now what are we doing there because he he infiltrated the human race we are now a manifestation of the act that they did we are born now good and evil see have we eat off the Tree of Life we were all been life-death wouldn't have been nowhere near us but because we ate of the tree of good and evil that's what we are now we're now bad eating off of the Tree of Life that's what this message is Alleluia is Jesus Christ revealed to us and who is the Tree of Life Jesus Christ we wouldn't have known that but it took a prophet to tell us that both of the three Jesus Christ died and so did Lucifer stood right there in the Garden of Eden and a tree was there to do what bear forth fruit Judah see so you and I must understand a man that the thoughts is spirit and if you received the thought you received the spirit of the thought because remember Amen you are what you eat that is the truth and the Bible said that spiritually he ate of the tree right she ate of it he said oh how the Bible said that she found that what he was saying was good and pleasant and they did eat see so she in her spirit Amen she received this now she is what because he promised her that you'll be a god but he didn't say he didn't tell her that she was already a God in the gods and the god narrow she's a God but she's up the world see now you saw all brother Bruce how could I say it this is why brother battle-ax uses a term he said a of a wheat germ in a a burro because the spirit of a kookaburra is different from the spirit of a wheat and though they may look alike that once that wheat germ is in a kookaburra and is brought to life it's no longer gonna behave like a kookaburra it's gonna behave like a weed seeing as how it is with us because of the seed of God in us and understand me that's why the Word of God the perfect way of receiving the Holy Ghost is by hearing the word because God said let there be light that spirit of that those words hit those hit those seeds and those seeds came to life that's how it is in the preaching that's why if a person can actually catch the spirit of what's being said because out of the Marvel of reason though you don't see it it's eternal fire eternal fire comes through these lips because you can't give something you don't have but once the Holy Ghost is in there and the inspiration is now being moved a man is being moved not by my thoughts where all these thoughts come you don't see me like this these thoughts are now coming from somewhere and I'm preaching I'm saying what he wants me to say and if we could take the faith and catch it it will owe in a set us on fire that God Amen spoke to me and I heard him hallelujah and look what he's doing for me now I am you got it you looking at brother Brooks oh brother Brooks a good message you don't understand you missing the whole spiritual application behind this whole thing God has used me as a channel to speak to you to bring life see that's how it all works is that all right thoughts in itself can either set you free a blind you right remember Johnny crow in his mind he could not allow himself to be free it wasn't he wasn't free but he had been tied up so long by the master to when he cut the card Johnny crow could never think about him himself being free and that's the way a lot of Christians are you're free you've been delivered but you know a lot of time we can't see it because Amen we we've been so long tired up and we've been so long in prison we don't even realize that God done set us free it's a true sometimes we want we want the Pentecostals periods we want feelings and goosebumps and all that stuff oh you know if I cut a cord you won't feel it the fact is you're free because the Bible said he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but the devil will make us feel because you anchor it up in our thoughts in our minds you know you got to have it and that's what happened to a lot of druggies you know you got to have it you got to do it you got to do nothing right great as he does in us than he that is in the world so you ain't gotta do nothing it's what you're listening to if you're gonna listen to the false preachers you're gonna get the false preachers result if you're gonna listen to the Holy Spirit talk to you and then you're gonna get the Holy Spirit results this is all to it is that right you not must understand him and by God's grace we are blessed how many I believe the Bible says according 54-17 no weapon I'll just believe that that spirit to me that's life to me no matter what the devil tries no weapon is that right was it chaotic to Jesus when he was on the boat he didn't care about all his the panicking of those disciples he didn't get up all nervous and all shook up hallelujah he got a peaceful and calm and then he said o ye of little faith where did you doubt see God had already given him the authority over the wind I seen people it's the truth we were on our way to the church I spoke to the wind and the rain I'm not saying nobody else didn't do it but I saw God somebody some say but cut off you wish your wife is just gonna stop and brother God is my witness Craig was there the think crystal was in the car at a time yes and it stopped there's no glory to me he told me I pray I said God we want a real meeting we want a dim meeting I know you got things to do I know this rain is for our purpose but the Lord if you will could you please stop the rain and bring a little cool I can't remem all I said but one thing I'm saying it happened God brought the rain several days it happened the same way no clouds in the sky no you know thunderstorm cloud all of a sudden clouds come in from somewhere brain and cooled it off and when the job was over dinner temperature shot back up very noticeable everybody's everyone's seen it see when you trying to do God's will is like God said to Joshua says Lord Sun stand still see that's the saying God we serve it's your purpose it's the reason why you want God to do things you see but if it's takfir this kingdom and to do things for his kingdom god will do just for you no weapon that is formed against these your prosper in every time that Shiraz against be in judgment thou shalt convinced there will be one town not all I saw him do this oh yes she did this man there won't be one tongue cuz you know who the heck accusing is the devil daughter you listen to it he don't care about what accuses what the accusers say concerning you the Bobby said you justify your free don't let the devil accuse you in your mind oh you're lost I can't not be lost I've been elected before the foundation where oh but you're doing this yes he's still working on me he's they're working on me this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is what of being that was one of those scriptures brothers brother you know I've seen it many times but you know our brother Richard shot that there'd be one time I'm like that that's good and I've been holding on to it since so no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper and every time that your rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of Lee saith the Lord that means the Lord sayeth hallelujah hit our righteousnesses of him who's gonna like lay any charge that's why Paul says to Godsey liquor ain't nobody goin King okay no no no no he said that's the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and set in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that it takes such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth in a rapture in grace God promises don't care how many science how many astronauts they sign up everything else and how many millions miles they can you see I don't care nothing about that there is a heaven there is a literal Jesus Christ there that will come in a body form to receive the church his church to himself no matter how old the story scene is still the truth I don't care all y'all been saying about the rapture it's coming how do you know it's here in me hallelujah I'm a witness of the rapture because the resurrection is living in me it's just about believing listen ah he says listen God said I am the Lord heals all that diseases I am God and I changed my amen God is the word and if God don't change how is the word going to change see I am God and I changed not the scripture says that God said it himself that if he can and if he cannot change then he is the word in the beginning was the word the Word was God the Word was God the unchangeable word right the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so that's what I'm saying if God is in you if God is in me if God is in anybody everybody that ain't that declare that God is in them it has to be made manifest it cannot be worse service lip service it has to be made manifest in other words it must be vindicated Mary was vindicated that she was a virgin there were a lot of mergers in Mary day but Mary was the virgin right and she was vindicated by what becoming impregnated with Christ and that's the bride of Jesus Christ she must become vindicated she has to be indicate how is it that God Himself steps into you to vindicate you brother Branham couldn't vindicate himself that was the Holy Spirit that vindicated him we he didn't for a long time he didn't even know he was a prophet of the age God vindicated him oh you said all what about the third pole he couldn't just turn it on when he wanted to God in his season turned it on so is it with us you can't turn on being the bride but at least you ought to know you're there you ought to know you're close to it however you know one thing that something is different about you is that right you're following in the steps of Enoch people do you really think that he Nadja's all of a sudden please God he had to walk with God to please God and you got to walk with God to please him the Bible doesn't say anything about Emax he knocks failures but you know they were there he was a man but whom God justify who do you go and his election hello he was born of a woman he didn't come here about no spaceship death was all in his body but he got a word from the Lord hallelujah and every time God would say some even say yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord see that's how you walk with God you say yes Lord whether you can do it or not you say yes Lord hallelujah see think about it that God let me I'm a clothes I'm not going to be I didn't plan to be long but think about it think about this scripture now I said a thought because you understand this is God thought God had conned in sin I don't need to write though he came here or he wrote on the wall in Babylon and he wrote on the earth when Jesus finger but Jesus finger he didn't have to write God don't go to school God created his school for us if you want to put it at learning for us now Adam didn't happen learn by way the way we learn we learned this way because of the fall think our faithful God is that he would even take the fall and produce his product through it now win us all over we will need school but Satan calls this thing so God used satyrs methods of Education to educate us hallelujah but when God want to talk to you he'd get rid of all of that right he took Moses in the bathroom desert right forty years he beat out everything Satan put in him so that he could receive a revelation of who he was and what his calling see that's what God does he don't need your reason he don't need my reasoning because your reasoning is that you have a thought that is resisting God you don't need it I don't need it right just may be dumb enough to follow him see and say a man to everything he says that's all I need to be but behold what manner of love is this that's why Jesus said listen how who was the son of God who was actually the God manifested in flesh he said I came doing nothing except the father show me now you think that Jesus Christ as a man wasn't intelligent very intelligent he was the most intelligent man ever walk the face of the earth but he waited he wouldn't he wouldn't use his own thoughts to do nothing and he was so he was so United that whenever at the spirit mu he booed is that right that that's just how not think about it the four living creatures of salt United with God they don't move about said wherever the spirit move they move they never move backwards always forward see and that's that's when you know the Spirit is moving you or the thoughts of God are leading you because you're not going backwards you're going forward one more thought he said I asked the question a Christian that's Christ in you and if Christ is in you then the word is in you and then if the word is in you when the light is shining how you're going to walk out of it see that's the question that's what is now the light the evening light shining the bride tree is blooming see so you and I must understand what is all about he says listen but if we if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happens and express it in Word form that word takes a hold and become material I'm gonna read that again but if it becomes a real revelation a real revelation comes to you an example you heal and he says that you see it before it happened somehow you see it it's gonna happen and express it in Word form like for instance goggled bless me I can feel it I eat I ask God for a car he gonna give me that I can see it now you don't see with your natural but your spirit that caught it and he says when you say it it will take form see that word takes a hold and becomes a material a thought expressed oh my how God could see your heart and your mind is so and filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and you'll excuse me win your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being he's it all mine he said what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has - if the very Holy Spirit has used so embalm or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own line you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you saw built unto your thoughts and your being is God's Spirit expressing itself through you he said what what kind of a church we would be right see and they that our sons of God are led by the Spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the Spirit of God feels that they can see where you empty yourself a man then will be then will be will be when the church in his power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus we're walking a step in his power in his thoughts it is being and it's moving he says see see what I mean he said then your thoughts will become words in your words we become materialized he said that's when the church is in its power you and I have been so yielded to his thought become our thought and all things become possible to them that believe Amen less tan Jesus we saw thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you've been better to us than we have been to ourselves Lord and I see as you continue to make your word clearer and clearer to us our purpose and what we had to
