[0:00] God Loved a certain group of people more
[0:02] than the devil and that group of people
[0:05] is you that's me that's what the devil
[0:10] says
[0:10] she wanted to rise above the physical
[0:13] Jews the sons of God
[0:18] now the Bible calls them stars of God
[0:22] now we know that the stars
[0:30] at one one star shine
[0:33] that means every Star has his own his
[0:37] own shiny and other terms
[0:40] every Star is different
[0:50] it means that the way the star shines is
[0:53] different from the the lights of this
[0:55] other start
[0:57] That's Why Us children of God we're not
[1:00] all the same
[1:01] you don't need to compare yourself to
[1:04] somebody else
[1:06] now every Star has an or as a gal in
[1:10] orbit
[1:13] and every Star has its own trajectory
[1:19] one star cannot get out of its
[1:21] trajectory to go into another trajectory
[1:24] that's how the children of God God has a
[1:28] plan for it that is a blessing for you
[1:32] no one can come and take that blessing
[1:34] from me
[1:36] that's what you we have to understand
[1:38] now this part interests me the most
[1:40] Jesus
[1:43] makes a statement Jesus
[1:46] he says father Glory female glorify me
[1:51] of the glory that I had from you before
[1:56] the foundation of the world now before
[1:59] Jesus Christ
[2:00] Jesus
[2:03] that he had a certain glory
[2:06] and he needed that Glory
[2:09] brother wants to show us
[2:12] let the glory that we want from the Lord
[2:16] we need that Glory right now that
[2:19] business has got meant to know we need
[2:21] that Glory right now as a Son of God
[2:25] you have to change the way you pray When
[2:28] you pray you have to say Lord I know
[2:32] because I come from you
[2:35] that means before the foundation of the
[2:37] world
[2:43] legit
[3:43] [Applause]
[4:03] [Applause]
[4:41] true nature foreign
[5:44] Israel the one who watches on Israel
[5:48] he does not sleep he does not Slumber
[5:52] that means the god that we serve tell
[5:55] God
[5:57] you did not create man
[5:59] so that man just takes care of himself
[6:03] you did not create man
[6:05] so that man takes care of him
[6:08] God created man
[6:11] take care of man
[6:14] God created man to take care of him
[6:17] that's why he said
[6:20] she says look at the birds
[6:23] they don't worry about what they have to
[6:26] eat
[6:27] now what what about me
[6:31] it's more than a bird
[6:34] that's more than a lion
[6:40] because he's gone
[7:30] [Music]
[7:32] send me somebody that can read to me the
[7:34] book of The Chronicles
[7:36] now as they open the book they started
[7:40] reading
[7:44] they start reading a story where
[7:46] Mordecai saved the life of the king I
[7:49] want to ask you a question
[7:51] now you think it just happened like that
[7:54] that when they open that book on that
[7:57] day start reading that no no
[8:00] God that's behind that now the king says
[8:05] now what did we do
[8:08] this man who saved the king
[8:12] they told him we didn't give him
[8:14] anything now the Bible says
[8:17] uh and as soon as
[8:21] soon as Airmen came back in the in the
[8:24] court of the king
[8:26] the king asked the question without even
[8:29] knowing who came in who got in in the
[8:31] court
[8:33] they just said who is in the court right
[8:35] now
[8:38] everybody who's in the court right now
[8:42] just got into the court got into the
[8:45] court right now

[8:49] what should we do for a man
[8:53] that the king wants to honor Amanda
[8:57] Amen in his pride
