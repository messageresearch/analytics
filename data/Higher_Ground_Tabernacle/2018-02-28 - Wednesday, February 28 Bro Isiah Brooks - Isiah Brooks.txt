John 10 and from st. John 10 we're gonna run down to Ezekiel and from Ezekiel we'll read a little bit of Malachi in John 10 beginning at the fourteenth verse I am The Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine you hear that I know my sheep and basically all that our mind know me as a father knoweth me even so no I the father and I lay down my life for my sheep another sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd Jew and Gentile Ezekiel 34 please time we forget in our natural minds but one thing about the Lord Jesus he never forget Ezekiel 34 11 through 14 but that said the Lord behold I even I were both search my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day and I will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them among the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the inhabitant places of the country I will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of Israel shall therefore be there shall they lie in good fold and in the fat pasture shall they feed among the mountains of Israel and I will feed my flock and I will cause them to lie down said the Lord God not only will I feed them when I cause them to rest I will seek that which was lost and bring them that which was driven away and I were buying up that which was broken and was strengthened that which was sick but I would destroy the fat and the strong I will feed them with judgment Malachi 3 I sung a song one time with the choir we this this particular verse was one of the verses in which the brother I wrote the song and even when we he wrote this song and this has been some years ago I fully I didn't fully understand it but now it's become a powerful revelation to me Malachi 3 we're going to read the 16th through the 18th verse then they that fear the Lord speak often one to another when you fear God it produces fellowship your fellowship is around the Word of God and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name can you that's powerful to me every time you mention God Oh speak his name it's placed in a book and they shall be mine said the Lord of Hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spare its own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth it's not there is a time when God will gather us we'll go in a rapture but come back down and we will judge judge those who was righteous and those who who are wrong God is good to us let us pray father we come before your Lord as humble as we know how we thank you for your goodness in your grace your mercy in your love Lord we thank you for tonight because you have declared where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst father we say Lord searches Oh God they'll be refining a thing that shouldn't be please take it out of us Lord is our desire to be lights of this world Lord give us grace that will not hide the light put it under a bushel but may we place it on the top of a hill on a top of a candlestick that the world may see help us now there would be true witnesses and witnesses in these last and evil days and you name Jesus Christ we pray you may be seated I like to entitle this message stone upon stone but also like to give it a theme they shall be mine God made that declaration you know we've been talking with various brothers brother rich and different ones for the Keith and different ones and so many thoughts have been going through my mind and I know that for a long period of time I preached about what God was doing with his Jerusalem cause every time I saw in the book of Revelation Jerusalem coming down and she was recognized as the Bride of Christ the wife of God III couldn't help but to understand even then that those those jewels those stones according to the scripture were significant to testimonies and you know what I see how that God through His grace have taken us through all of these ages how I got the thought of stone upon stone because I thought about how the foundation was laid Jesus Christ was the cornerstone and understand it that that cornerstone was the very foundation was built about it and you and I must understand that each age was built upon and Christ Jesus you and I really don't I would say it like this I don't know whether we realize it or not but I'll out of all of the ages even from the time the Jewish church this church or this people of this age I'm speaking of bride is the only one since the Jewish church who had been able to receive the headstone it's each age we built upon we laid a foundation we built the stone emphasis all the way up amen to Laodicea amen and now the capstone all of these things all of these layers all of these foundations you know built upon and then eventually that all of those stones become one stone we find out is that right because really Jesus prayed father I would there be one even as real one I'm speaking of the spiritual aspect because I want us to realize Amen that we are living in a scientific age and scientists are building all of these things they're trying to reach the moon and trying to reach other galaxies and sending out probes and all of these things we had a prophet in our day but the Brandon who told us they will come a day they'll be surprised to know that the things that they're seeing is not millions of billions or whatever miles light-years away but these things are bending and they they are different dimensions amen and they're actually moving around in a circle if you understand eternity the way we write it it's either an eight or circle Amen showing that this circle and this eight had no beginning nor no ending and so when we think about this age with brother Branham says Amen that we are in a time where science is going to backfire on mankind they building all of these atomic weapons we are now living in a time where not only are I ran you want to name them but every country is capable of mass destruction probably God said even in the time of Enoch science was so great far greater than than what we know of now because we cannot build a pyramid think about it if you've ever I'm going to to Egypt I've seen the Great Pyramid I've seen those huge stones we don't have an equipment nowhere that could actually take those stones and place them almost a mile high stones that I am be a wearing weighing turns after tons brother Edelman led by the Spirit of God he said they must have had a control atomic power he said gasoline power electric power would never lift those boulders and build such as the pyramid they weigh hundreds of tons and setting away in the air and almost about a city block high mostly and how they ever get them up there that's the mystery and so perfectly until a razor blade couldn't go between them hone down they are masterpieces mastermind and they got so smart and so screwed and the Bible said to become workers of good good wood and workers of brass and great days of science and it got so smart - they figured they'd just outsmart God and didn't need him anymore remember how they did that amen when they thought they can outsmart God and they built the Tower of Babel God came down and confused the language they thought they were so smart a man that they didn't need God no more so God just flood to the earth off but whatever it is it's something in the inner fallens man's nature that makes him think that he's smarter than God it is a trick of the enemy because that's the way Lucifer thought he thought he was smarter than God and anytime he can get a man or men on one Accord where they believe that they're smarter than God they are headed for destruction here's the prophecy that being God not willing that any should perish talked to a man out in the field one day and nor and and told him to erect an ark to protect him from the judgment God led him to do it in other words when we get to the place where we're so smart that we're gonna erase God out of the equation then God in in in return we races us out of the equation we're living in a scientific agent in the reason why I'm I'm bringing this because had not God determined to find us we would still be lost because there is no way that man could ever find his way back after the fall God had to be the one that was searched for Adam Adam didn't even have it in him to search for God but God would search him for Adam and God is still searching for his kind now scientific we are in an agent and at this time with man and and I love this because we find out that we're in an age where man is glorifying himself if you know and you've read about Esther you'll never find God in the picture because during that time that Esther is a book where where man is being glorified you know the king he's got everything you know and and and all that he wants you know he's got his own church why whatever and he doesn't need anything and and you won't find God in there because he was working with a Gentile king that only knew about idols but then God places himself in the picture by bringing Edessa into the king's palace and now in age where God has been vanquished vanquished out of the out of the the scene of things like our day we put him out of the church we put him out of everything is that right the Bible says according to Revelation the third chapter he's no longer in the church he's knocking at the door third chapter trying to get into his own church so it hasn't been the world that has placed him out is that the church has done the same thing but the Bride of Christ because God said he'll never leave himself without a witness and so God is placed in our lives a desire to serve Him and him only now scientists are scientific things are perishable right he said it comes from the earth but the unscientific things are the real things that come from heaven hallelujah amen you may be able to explain my natural existence you can say by God's grace that I was born of a woman by the name of Clara and whose whose husband at the time was at the nail name Isaiah but you cannot take it any further than that and what you see now Amen is not as real this is not to realize there this is the house of Isaiah the real Isaiah is the thing that you can't physically see with your eyes that's the real you right because you can fake it and make it with this outward appearance but on the inside God knows the real you excuse me here my shoe string came loose I don't want to get happy and trip god is so good to us we appreciate him for being so real to us but we thank God for His mercy and His grace thank you brother so we look at this thing and we say well remember it was always backfired other words we're living in a day well where science is about to backfire again right when in in the days of noir God made a way for noir to escape the destruction of science hallelujah and now God has made a way for us to the - to escape the destruction of science now he goes on the same but the unscientific things are the real things that come from heaven God holy spirit angels supernatural they are the everlasting things believe on the Lord don't try to scientifically prove anything just have faith in God remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden how many knows that one was a them was the tree of science the other was the tree of faith as long as men eat from the tree of faith he lived but the first bite he took off of the tree of science knowledge he separated himself from God and he destroyed himself and every time man bites from the tree of science he destroys himself he he he bite off gunpowder kill the comrade he bit off automobiles off the tree of science kill more people than all the wars put together he did himself bit himself off a corporate bomb now wonder what he's going to do with that see science destroys faith deals I have nothing against the tree of science it's done wonders but you can't depend on it here's where you have to depend on your faith it's everlasting believe on God believe that he's raised from the dead and may he into your your lovely audience tonight and show himself alive to you by working to his church see you and I must understand Amen when it comes to science and this is where I feel like we've become weakened Amen because we fail to see where we come from this is not our home science is not our protection matter of fact science is the reason why most of us have been sick you know disease it carries admit because it meant before science there was no such thing as disease how to lose but when the word broke I was broken been suckers Amen feel the atmosphere controls everything because of science we are dying physically hallelujah but by faith we'll live forever [Music] that's right give me one more coat he says now we're living in modern science age and no at all age wherever they proves by science if you just go back in the Bible you find out that just exactly the kind of age they had before the antediluvian instruction all of you know that and the lineage of Caze children become scientists the lineage of self children were spiritual and those two different classes of people exist today scientists and spiritual minded people they should be workers together but it's very contrary in other words you can't work science and faith together they're contrary one to the other hallelujah you say why are you saying all of these things because look at yourself if you go by science it's impossible for you to be translated hallelujah but by faith your translation is inevitable hallelujah now you said what do you mean where are you going with this understand by God's grace that God when he created Adam he first created him or what a spiritual being then God took that spiritual being and put him in what clay right call it dust if you want to whatever the whole thing is you came this part of you came from the earth right but there's a part of you that never had a beginning and will never have an ending that part of you Amen was was came by way of faith hallelujah not just any kind of faith it was God's faith hallelujah I thought about a stone because I said they shall be mine you know when we talk about jewels we think about stole a jewel is a stone you know it's a different kind of stone it's a valuable stone it's not like a granite stone it's valuable I remember going to a brother house amen years ago he's deceased going on with the Lord amen but he travelled throughout South America and he had a big old box he said I want to come I want to show you something he took me in his room and he showed me his treasure all kinds of jewel stones rocks sapphires you name it he had it there and and he had a big box of those I don't know how many money was worth but if you could just take it to this somewhere I'm sure they were worth a lot of money he was a millionaire as it was but nevertheless a man he had all of these jewels that had not even been cut yet that was given to him by the native people as gifts and you think about all that he had and I thought Lord I said he did not rest his soul upon it because when he died he left those jewels with whoever was left in his family stones that could that that that are formed and you know every stone is formed by way of pressure see there's no way you could be a diamond without experiencing pressure has it have been told that a coal of a cold rock a rock of coal amen is a diamond in its early stages and it is pressured and pressured and pressured impression a mentally becomes a diamond that looks so impossible to me I don't even know how to explain it but listen you and I when God found us he knew we were diamonds but maybe some of us will steal coves and now he's got to pressure us into becoming diamonds but that's not the finished product after you become a stone that is a diamond you've gotta be cut and every diamond is an instrument all value real value to it until you cut it and guess what the purpose for is it now cutting a diamond is to make sure that whatever angles you being that is being cut in that diamond it will reflect the rainbow those seven brilliant colors of God amen and that's exactly what God is doing with you and I but God I heard brother Keith somebody said something about the temple of God and the limits said that's exactly who we are hello did you know you was a stone that's what the Bible call you a lively stone right first Peter says amen two and four four to five to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious he also as living stones are built up a spiritual house that's why he said what what do you mean brother books I think about it man cannot build character just like no man could have built him in the Pyramid without the help of God and you and I know that Enoch beautiful as the prophet said so how he did it nobody knows but no man y'all understand what I'm saying and I'm almost jumping I'm getting excited cuz I'm trying to get to where I'm going you and I must understand that the stones these songs these songs that gotten out shaping why did God put you in this assembly because you are stone and you ought to be chipped and eight until all who are part of this church must become one stone stone upon stone that's how we must fellowship and that's why the prophet of God said he said now when that pyramid was made Amen there in Egypt he said it was so tight that you couldn't even slip a razor blade between it I've been to the pyramid and don't you know the beginning when they had that pyramid you can see how the robbers came to Egypt because when that pyramid was completely formed it had an outer covering that reflected itself like gold and you and I must realize they men by the grace of God that pyramid you said all brothers listen that pyramid withstood the flood hello somebody there was no other building that was able to stand but that pyramid why because it was prophecy it was a word that's right that's what the Bible said the Bible said the the grass will wither the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord shall stand and what was the pyramid it was a Bible a constructed Bible Oh Lord see cuz God rolled it in the heavens he wrote it in the pyramid and then he wrote it here that's why if you understand the construction of the pyramid you'll know that we're right at the King's Chamber hallelujah amen and going up to the King's Chamber it had seven steps and you and I must understand you must take several steps to get there a man his brother rich and I we were talking I said Darius had the capstone you had the space in between us and now everybody don't see it the way I see it and maybe I'm wrong but I said like this amen if we must grow up into Christ that space which is after the seven because we've been smitten out of the church ages but that space represents the invisible union of Christ and his bride hallelujah so in between we feel in the space as he comes down we feels of it we become him he becomes us hallelujah it's only one period he's only one god hallelujah is only one bride think stones were used for various things stones in the Old Testament was used for stoning it was a judgement weapon right even so in the Old Testament guess what the Bible says Amen that I forgot how many pounds of hail will fall from the sky can you imagine a two pound hail I think it was maybe more than that I can't remember but it comes it will crash if you had a head it wouldn't it would have been you would have no head after that events you know it's going to crush it's going to destroy it's going to tear up everything hallelujah is that right a stone is a seal it can be used as a seal it was our stone was used to seal Jacobs well you ought to get a little happy there hallelujah a stone was used to seal the tomb of Jesus you understand me a stone stones him in rocks Amen y'all must understand amen our seal is a stone he's strong and Dan you said I've seen that stone hewn out of the mountain well you're not gonna seal it seal something up valuable that Roman stone was so heavy I forgot how many turns in war and a weight and and and you know here Jesus said told Mary Martha y'all go and move the stone all the way to stone I don't know how they did it but they did it but what was a Lazar excuse me roll away the stone of Lazarus and what was behind there to the meeting out there it looked like nothing all they could feel it there was distance flow but there was something of value that was hidden behind the stone [Music] when God said let him come for guess what happened new life a man who had been bound for four days right he knows something The Magus blowed him up amen it comes out walking that all right and God comes along and says Amen loose the man take all them all them crease and dog was off of him hallelujah loose the man hallelujah and let him go and guess what when he became free of all his dog was and all of that guess what happened the next thing was that it's up in the evening time sitting at the table with Jesus feasting and that's where we are today hallelujah we must take away all the crease that dog was any and everything that's got us bound up Graco's is what they are hallelujah is that okay you and I must understand that Jesus the Bible says wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded remember jesus said foxes have holes birds have nests but the Son of man has no way to lay his head he was saying listen I am the Cornerstone I am the headstone but I am going to be rejected hallelujah how many of you would have followed a man who not even he was so poor he didn't even have a house of his own hallelujah he said basically if you follow me you follow me for the word and not for what can give you it's something about the word he said what what do you mean brother Brooks why did not God when God gave Moses Amen the commandments why didn't he take a see fit and in the engine right the King Commandments amen on some level something but he took two tables of stone amen like the right team in the left chamber of a heart and he roped it men those laws why because in the heart of land his heart was as stony as a stone that was hewn out of the mountain hallelujah but God Amen in Ezekiel I believe said I will take away that stony heart and I'm gonna give you a heart of flesh I'm gonna put my spirit in your spirit and I'm gonna cause you to be a new what is God doing he taking the stones that had no life is that right because he told Israel he said listen if you don't cry out I'll make these stones cry out for me hallelujah I don't know whether he had me in mind but all I know is that this stone will worship hallelujah stone upon stone God building a house that's why God said you are the temple of God you are a stone hallelujah is that right that's what they did they put Jesus in a stone they took a stone put him in a stone laid him on a stone hallelujah but when that resurrection came hallelujah the stone that had him bound had to what roll away hallelujah like they say a rock in a rock our Lord our God and you and I must understand he meant that's what God is doing Oh help me Jesus I hope I could get it over cheer like I see it unto you therefore which believing is precious but under them which are disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made this head of the corner in that amazing because jesus said as they did it in the green that should do it in the dry don't think you're going to get away with prayer from persecution persecution is going to come to you amen they had the real deal hallelujah Jesus Christ God himself amen and listen they literally wanted to stone the stone because he said I and my father are one hallelujah they wanted to stone him but they didn't understand who he was ha ha that Bible said that same cornerstone has now God made the head of the corner why because the Jewish Church rejected him but this Bride of Christ will not hallelujah ha because God has taken stones and laid him upon he stoned hallelujah oh I love this what was so beautiful nobody really knows where all of those stones and then came from that consent that made that Egyptian pyramid it really wasn't Egyptian pyramid it was just in Egypt is that right but listen what happens here here is this pyramid amen that represents Christ that represents God that represents the bride in Egypt hallelujah but Jesus was born in Bethlehem oh but when the enemy tried to kill him they just had taken down the eagle hallelujah amen there's a representation of him there hallelujah so by reading by reading the temple or by reading a Mende the pyramid Jesus realized - that one day I'm going to be rejected he understood the headstone was missing hallelujah but he also knew that they were coming of people that will actually be ordained to receive the hair sold we all understand what this message is this message is here amen to bring you into a place where you can receive the headstone United with Christ that's what our whole purpose for being here is to unite with Christ hallelujah you therefore which believe it's precious right but the Sun is a stone of stumbling a rock of offense to them which tumble that the word being disobedient wearing to all so they were appointed so understand that those who are disobedient those who are willfully rejecting the word they can't help it they were appointed herod was appointed Judas was appointed hallelujah but you take a man that desire God that really wanted a god to fulfill him in his heart that man came from God because the devil never had a desire to serve God hallelujah King was given the right things to do and all he had to do was do it and he wouldn't do it hallelujah but if you've got a thirst for the Living God the Bible said if a man hunger and thirst after me and he shall be filled right so you look at this and you say well oh Lord what is the problem what is it what is the whole thing behind it you gotta realize you are stolen in the building like I told you amen when it comes to a puzzle I'm a piece of the puzzle and the puzzle is not complete without me hallelujah and so without you either you act you got to understand Amen you might be just a part of the framework but you're not that that I don't care if you're not part of the big beautiful flower or whatever that's in the middle of it you are just as important to the person who's put the puzzle together you love the Lord listen you and I must understand that this thing is so spiritual it's like my mind can't even comprehend I can't even grasp what I'm trying to get over to you all I know is this that I am a part of the building and when the building is complete he would then come for us hallelujah oh come on somebody hallelujah Solomon thought he built a building huh come up with something harder even we realized Amen that was Solomon Amen built that that that building guess what he did he got stones from everywhere he got trees from everywhere hallelujah and he ordered Mason reason everything else and they hammered and they cut they hammered in the cut but when they came to the building there was no sound of a saw there was no lower a sound of a hammer oh come on somebody hey you got to understand what these are significant up it means that it was God shaping us it was God amen who was actually fitting us together hallelujah it's the truth it is God's program that's literally gathering these stones remember I just read to you no matter where you are on earth God is gathering your stones hallelujah you can be an advocate you come in Asia you can be in Germany you can be in Russia no matter where you are you God cannot finish a building without you I love it wherefore has Darwin they laid the foundations of the earth that's what God is asking Joe declare if thou has understanding if thou has understanding who have laid the measure thereof and if thou North or who have stretched the line upon it wherefore are the foundation there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone there when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy hallelujah you said presidents were you there yes I was there he was there too you said prove it because I'm shouting now hallelujah I'm shouting for joy now rah because the power of the blood hallelujah we saw God's Redemption plan hallelujah back then we saw his Redemption plan that's how you can come to Christ now you were there is that right you were there when John wept and the voice says who's worthy to over the book and the loose the seals see we saw that hallelujah we were there because we realized oh we were fallin Hindman we had a stone hallelujah dolly was rejected that same stone then you said I saw him you how do the mountainous cold cut rolling down the Babylon destroying what all of the cities and let me tell you something you and I was a part of that stone what do you think you here doing right now you are destroying the works of Satan with your lives with your testimonial Jeremiah is not my word like as afar I'll never forget the scripture my mother couldn't read it right and I asked the Lord once I came got saved Lord how did my mom make this thing how how how she couldn't read or write she had to take whatever the preacher said whether it was right or wrong you see but when you get the Holy Ghost yeah holy goes to tell you something hallelujah and he said and this is what I saw this is my first vision I ever had I saw a big old hammer coming down on a big bold up breaking it into pieces and I went to a minister I said listen I just had a strange thing happened to me I saw right here I start a big hammer like a big mallet coming down and breaking that right oh brother he said that's the scripture took me right to the scripture that's when I realized how God dealt with my mom about my vision hey man you gotta you had to be there to know what I'm talking about cuz she see me do stuff if she said not you god I don't like ya she tell me things and I lied to her no mama you know I wouldn't do such a thing God was merciful to me he spared me in my ignorance I was like Sarah hallelujah he should have killed me but I was a part of him amen ah he said it's not my word like as fire said the Lord woo see that's what I can understand how can you have the revelation of the word it is not like fire is that right yeah when Jeremiah said I preach them no more don't mom daddy's old people hahaha the Baba said it was like fire shut up in his bone what was that word was still burning hallelujah sayeth the Lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in the pieces hallelujah when I heard that today when God gave me that scripture today I said Dada says right exactly what he's doing because the rock and the bread is the same is that right oh come on somebody jesus said I am that rock is that right he said I am that Brahe and on the road to Emmaus he was breaking the bread he still breaks the bread he still breaks the rock into pieces and give us revelation oh God I'm enjoying myself here or not I just know I'm dead I'm having a good time see you and I must understand is the power of God that cuts the stones no matter where you are is God will cut your stone and each and every one of us are shaped differently our cuts are different because our cuts must be cut according to way God wants them to be cut in order for us to join together the understanding is one body one bread one solid rock who Christ the solid rock I stand ah yeah I don't stand on that rock I do and what is that rock is the revelation of who Jesus is that's what the church was built on Paul the revelation of Jesus Christ is that right John said if any man say Amen that that that the crisis in come hallelujah If any man talk and speak about the Holy Ghost and say he's not coming to you that's what the whole purpose is the whole purpose of Christ's death is to bring life back to his people and how can life come back into old dead Rock it's by the Holy Spirit is that right oh come on somebody my God is God and you and I must understand listen when Joe I don't know how what was left of job hallelujah he may have had been maybe a teaspoon of ash left but when God called from all that ash came back together and what was missing was found hey man listen he said you know Solomon temple when it was cut out he was cut out in different parts of the world the trees the Cedars of Lebanon floated down to Joppa and from there to ox to Jerusalem and so forth and the stones Mason's in the years of cutting the different stones they shaped different ways but when they come together there wasn't a free stone among them every strong laid right to its place how did they do it and I think that's what gods are doing he's just cutting us out of Methodist and Baptist Presbyterian in a cautious but when Jesus come we'll all go strong to stone see minute with love of God and God would take his church mmm each age is C minute in other words you can't get to brotherly kindness without faith you can't get to patients without virtue each one of these stones must be laid correctly remember we read the rich we're having a good time of day and brother Mike amen you know the love the Lord it is so important that you have the Holy Spirit in you you know without the Holy Ghost you won't make a rapture God is like a magnet and the only thing he's pulling up is his Holy Spirit how is that right that's what you and I must be really careful because we're living in the last days God is now withdrawing his Holy Spirit from the earth if he did not do that Satan couldn't do what he's doing don't you know why the Pentecostal churches had to die out because their power what they were experiencing the Holy Ghost moving kept Satan a bank but when they began to fall Satan began to grow in strength when they began to look at Hollywood and want the things of Hollywood say to him again to grow in strength when they start looking at the world and all the things in the world Satan began to grow in strength hallelujah but God's Word it's perfect if God can called Lazarus from the dead he can call this church from the dead and that's what he did is that right he said Ezekiel can this dry bones live again I don't know why I'm going over some stuff I've already gone over he said but the true church all over the world has shaped down to a place that there's come a ministry among it just like the ministry of Jesus Christ now what they've got they've got the thing in condition now what's the next thing the rejected stone of the pyramid cut out of the mountain without what without hand God sent it do you see it you understand me so what are you saying brother Brooks when the prophet of God was here he was not trying to produce his own program it was they rejected stone it was Christ in the Prophet Amen that this generation rejected yeah you understand me cuz Laodicea had to reject Jesus Christ you say scripturally prove it revelations third chapter he's outside the door of the laird see interchange so they rejected Christ but God had predestinated a group a special kind of people that literally were word and is word hallelujah in them they were ordained to be word oh they had to be ordained word because he is the word and the word can all be compatible to the word so they were contain word they are the only group in in in all of the ages that will come to perfection and in their perfection they were then pull the rest up because like I said God is like a magnet and they cannot be completed without us and where does it comes right back down to the very thing that we lost in the beginning which was divine love because when we lost divine love then being came hatred and when hatred came in who was the serpent a man guess what he'd do this what you see you love the Lord it's shaped up image so that God it may can do great things for us right so Christ is that stone he wasn't born of a man he was born of God he is the coming he is coming for a church that's been reborn again by the Spirit of God think about it even David understood the power of a stone hallelujah he picked up five smooth stones but you see let me tell you something he did meet up and want to bring down Goliath you don't need a man a great education with all kinds of degrees all you need in men is one stone and that's the stone who is Jesus Christ our Lord hallelujah if he can bring down the kingdoms and kingdoms and Kingdom surely he can bring down the Devils and the Giants in your life right I'm chopping this up but I'm trying to give you something here to the overcomers remember Jesus said they shall be mine just remember that and we mentioned this the last time we preach revelation 2:17 that he that have an ear let him hear what the Spirit said to the church to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna oh is it that means everybody doesn't won't get it something that's hidden that God is gonna give you right my grandma used to do that she waited all the children give me how are you saying I was her favorite she knew I loved the little sweet biscuits used to make Ruth but anyway let me go on imited them down cometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and we give them what a white stone I can't tell you what this means to me but all I know is even in that dream everybody was dressed in white remember brother Branham talked about he said when I went over there crosses beyond the curtain of time he said everybody was dressed in different attire this group had a color they had on and this color had this color that that's the way I see it you know because if I'm going to go with this then every age had a color they that represented them to st. God will Israel had certain colors they wore don't you know that we have four we had twelve tribes and four was under that Eagle banner for was under the Ox banner for was under the man's banner is that right so you got to understand Amen that God he dealt he deals the way he deals he you know me but at that top it's pure light whites how do you want to say it but it's so pure amen that's why you must understand this church must be without spot wrinkle implement right up diamond is that right did the Prophet God basically say that we're diamonds we're cut right and in this age where is the the beauty of a diamond is at the top it's where the light comes in and reflects through all the others Harlan oh when you see what God is doing with us it's not something that we can consider lightly and the reason why like the Prophet God said he said it won't be because of your goodness and all my goodness not that we so righteous that God is going to do this thing God has promised it y'all know what being a child of promise means Satan can't alter it when God promised Isaac didn't matter how good Ishmael could have been would've been shut up in the promise was Isaac's hallelujah he saw in Jacob God said I loved I loved Jacob and I hate II saw what was going to change that nothing God said it that's the way well look what Jacob did and God still made him a promise hallelujah what was was Jacob they're looking a mint for this angel to visit him no sir he did not know an angel was going to come but somehow in that season God put him in prayer y'all hurt me God put him in prayer and then god dispatched the angel who did that Jacob didn't do it God did it y'all understand me all of these things are orchestrated by God and I say to people listen they're all when the squeeze come well if the squeeze is gonna get us in line that's what we need it's under pressure hallelujah when we really call on God it's the truth the Prophet God brother I'm said it's a shame that God has to do with that way but if that's the way man is we we're just lazy and dilatory God has to let things happen to us in order for us to look up hallelujah I am a free woman are you free hallelujah who made you free Jesus made you free he'll Missoni set free is free indeed this is what Galatians says tell me he the desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it's written that Abraham had two sons the one was by a bonds woman bonds made the other by a freewoman but he who was up the bonds woman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was born by what and are we not born by promised God promised there would be a bride hallelujah is that right when brother Brennan drew those those those seven church age is hallelujah later she'll was completely blacking out and God allowed him to put a little strip of light there what was that God promise lord have mercy which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar for this a guards Mount Zion in array Sinai in Arabia and answereth to Jerusalem which now is and is in the bondage and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all I'm trusting you can get over you you know because I realized by God's grace that we're living in a dangerous time the world is and we're living at a time where the bride has competition there's a false bride and a true bride right and you know you and I know how many of us know it it's very difficult to get anyone out of those mega churches to hear the word you know I was difficult because it's a cage they're not free then bondage they literally married the church it's whatever my church says and what the word says is whatever months but we don't believe it that way but the word said it but that ain't the way my church teach it see that's that's their explanation and by doing that they are bondage it shows that they're not born but their birth what they're born into is a fleshly car no experience and but the to trial of God is born spiritually hallelujah how can a man be born of the Holy Ghost and not know that God is his father that's all his mother how can a baby be born a baby when it comes out of the womb knows who mama is and every birth a man gives you a revelation of who your parents are how can you say you got the Holy Ghost amen and don't see Amen that God is the one who created you made you amen and because of him you exist hello you'll never get a baby in a place where that baby don't trust her mother that baby put all of her trust into that one who know he who gave them birth that's the truth and that's the way we supposed to do God we should never grow up so much till we feel like we can be independent from him absolutely not revelation 17 tells us and I'm almost done a little bit just a little bit just give me a little more time because I want you to realize him and how valuable this revelation is to you now what is a stone and you know the diamond is the hardest of all stones and God places you in a position where he puts you on top which is the hardest of all stones and he's going to cut you he's going to chip and cut until all those seven birches be seen flowing through you cutting and chipping is not I'm sure not a good feeling if a stone could speak you probably think say to you you're killing me and but in reality you cutting and shaping him so the beauty of what's inside can come out you understand me right so he says listen he so he carries me away in the spirit of the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the one was raid in purple and scarlet color and you can just look at the way they dress and see that but it is I forgot what they call the priest or whatever they are with the red on then they have purple all kind of colors but anyway my point is if a man you gotta be blind not to see it right what church you know is more beautiful than that one who in in Rome it's kind of spooky to me but you know to the natural man you know seeing dead things and naked folks all over the wall it's alright with them y'all understand me but when I go in there when I've never been any but I've seen pictures I said that artist he was perverted you can say whatever you want to say for someone right in that milk and people that who that's holy holy that's sinful you mean to tell me God don't cover you and then in his church you're gonna make the people naked that makes no sense it took me a long time before I would go get a kewpie burger just because of the baby [Laughter] thank you just disturb me but anyhow let's go home Oh Lord listen up rate in purple it's dollar color dick with gold and precious stones and pearls and don't you see her daughter's doing the same thing you know you go to these big Omega churches they got to work when God said let there be light and they want to put on performances they cut off the lights it's just opposite and then they got their own you know their own pillar cloud coming out of pipes and you know and it's just beautiful to the natural man like being in a concert in the dark but I guess you can see better I don't mean to be funny but my point is you know those things that appeal to those people is because they've got they're blind they can't see but a man whose eyes have been open can automatically see something's wrong with this this is not worship this is entertainment it's entertainment you got your stars and the Bible said in this day they will worship the creature more than the Creator and that's what they do singing about Jesus saying about God but they're the ones that's being worshipped Revelation that's what the false church does that's what they do but not the Living God not the living church the living church only worship the Lord Jesus hallelujah oh listen revelations 18 7 through 10 it says how much she have glorified herself lived deliciously so much torment and saw sorrow gives her for she said in her heart I sit a queen and AM no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine II what God's gonna destroy her ha she's false he saw her he saw her daughters destroy everything is all know that those who will escape are those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life that's it if you take anything I don't care if it's a cross on your neck and you think that cross saves you you are lost mama can't save your daddy can't save you hallelujah you and I must understand Amen that this revelation brings us to a truth Easterbrook's how can you say the things you see let me put it this way what would be your attitude you found out you lived in the day of Enoch and you was left behind Enoch was the only one saved out of his whole generation he was the only one that made a rapture anak what a percentage of a percentage at least we can say with no it was eight out of maybe eight million and one out of a million Amen perhaps made it right but when it come to Enoch it was more than that what was the percentage and the bow said as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of lot don't you understand that kind of thing is coming the same way I think most of the stones have been gathered already we are living in the place where the stones are scarce now God is searching looking everywhere for that last stone that he could place in position you just trusted hope you one of those stones you said what God ain't fair yes he is God came to do one thing and that was is to redeem his own and redemption means to buy back that which was already he is now he whatever Satan did and Satan has children right but I was said more the children are the bonds woman then those are that of the free Satan produced this world with his own children because he wanted his own Eden and that's what he's got we're now living in a Eden of serpents the true Bride of Christ and she's the only real jewel she's the only real valuable thing that's why God takes his jewels he said I come in the house I break in like a thief I'll rob you of my jewels I'm gonna take my jewels back they shall be mine see and that's what we must understand we never belong to the devil the devil stole us he took us away amen in a counterfeit way hallelujah but the blood of Jesus Christ was paid paid the price amen now God can take back his you I don't know about you but I'm part of the group and in Malachi he says I'm gonna gather my Jews what do you think he's doing a man because after the rapture then you see Amen the building of God that's what always got me they coming down like jewels sapphires and carbuncles in all kinds of jewels who was it representing you you the jewels that God gathered and built his house you say what do you mean brother Brooks because the Bible said in there there was no temple God was the champion hallelujah oh come on somebody there's no building but you the building that's in the building you're the ones you the house you look stone you're God you're the one a man that builds God's habitation or God builds his habitation by way of you [Applause] that's what he said and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth was passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband hallelujah I love it they meant because what God did God told Joshua and Moses said you tell Moses you tell oh those daughters tell him to get all those jewels and stuff from Pharaoh gather everything you can gather amen let the daughters put on all kinds of jury because what we we have spoiled them we have we've destroyed them and we taken all the valuables with us hallelujah amen and what did he do they said let us bury this ha ha they knew they weren't gonna return hallelujah and they got all the jewels and took him out that's what God's doing and he's getting all the valuables right out of either before he destroy him Oh glory to God I'm almost done amen and I heard a great voice from heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them ah-dah-mah and they shall be his people where minute the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it's done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the Cornerstone a headstone I would give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the waters of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving the abominable the murderers whoremongers sorcerers idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death so you see God even give the children of disobedience a stone but it's called brimstone oh lord have mercy I love this alas Kerchak lycée built on because that's what comes out of the earth brimstone don't come from heaven it comes out of the earth he comes right out of hell where they came from so you said we're Brotherhood's don't talk so hoarse but that's what it is Jesus talk hard she said hey you of your father the devil he whatever he did you gonna do it too right oh lord help me Jesus ate and the Builder the building of the walls of it was Jasper look at this and the city was pure gold like unto a clear crystal and the foundation of the wall of the drive were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third you see what I'm saying he foundation and of stone and each stone was a different color the fourth an emerald the fifth sawdust the six dunks the sixth sardius the seventh you know it goes all the way down to the twelfth and you got to understand each what do you mean each one of those stones represented an apostle so each apostle had a stone that means all of them did works that were different from one or another and as the brother and I was talking today amen there are some of those apostles you haven't you haven't you didn't hear nothing about them other than they were apostles but they did what they were supposed to do and there are stones that represent them their victory many of us where are we you got you got william branham you can see his scriptures throughout the scripture but where are you you're one of those stones that's in their right laid out there with him is that right oh come on the truth is it's the truth he said my people that God gave under his ministry but look at this he's not here so whose ministry are you really under acts that's all I'm saying and don't you know this age gets a greater reward out of all of the ages your world war will be greater that's what he said that's what he said what are you saying because when L either left off the scene Isaac became Rebecca's husband it was Isaac that talk Rebecca from that point on you understand me lord help me Jesus but you got to understand he said nothing different for what but Eleazar said now and I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need for the Sun neither of the moon to shine it in but the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof y'all understand whoo this whole natural thing was spiritual from the beginning and even though we'll be witnessing natural things it's because of the spiritual things that stood before the natural hallelujah we'll have a body but it made a spiritual body a body that can walk through the wall a body that can travel like a thought hallelujah a body that can heat hallelujah and you say well high in the world that can be because God took a word body and he took that same dust that she was bought brought into this world with that was cursed because it was Harvard he took that same dust Amen and made a glorified body out of it but it's still dust still made out of the same stuff a rock is made out of y'all done I'm done yes I'm done and they shall bring listen you know when and I don't know whether I ever heard brother Chris Hall priest but he preached years ago about the glory of God and it was to me it was phenomena like I don't know too many preachers to this day that could bring the word like he did it's a strange thing but nevertheless when when I saw that scripture on the New Jerusalem ascended with the glory of God it meant God Himself was in there he was in her that's how come she had his glory she was in him he was in her and at that time they had become a wine right it's the truth because in the beginning it was Adam and though she had a feminine part the feminine part only recede the glory of the masculine part because the feminine had not yet been seen and after that y'all know what happened but now she becomes him and the same glory y'all is beyond comprehension you can grasp it in your mind you just got to believe it it's good to say she descended with the glory of God that Stan is beyond anything that's there it's beyond anything you can comprehend usually could only only thing you can do is believe what he says we are in a position and them telling you there is no way I pray this way we we talk like this we talk oh god please don't don't let me miss it but in reality of your bride you can't it's what he has done and he is determined to see you through do you really think like brother once said that God went through Calvary to lose one he went through all that agony with hope ah he understood the process he knew and seen the outcome and you and I are part of that outcome there is no way all I can say is if you have the faith to believe it then you have the faith to receive it that's all it is if you got faith to believe it just receive it and that faith by receiving it would become a reality to you old brother Brooks about how I'm gonna do it you're not doing it now it's God in you that's doing it hallelujah it's like Adam getting up out from the ground and said long look what I made God made Adam I don't wanna be whatever he would have been the dust of the ground whatever he would have been but it was God who made Adam and if God made the man like that in the beginning he must make the man like that I mean he is not by works it's grace you know that's the way it was supposed to be in the beginning by Sun God chose you you didn't choosing him and listen there is no failure in God hallelujah you said oh well I've got so many problems did you know God knew that before he called you you got Gardner said well this person is either that person is in bad shape I hope I can get it straight no God knew you know God don't take take easy things and work with he takes the bad stuff to work with y'all no but yeah do y'all know that look at his Bible look through the word God didn't take the righteous you know matter of fact everybody they thought there was righteous God Jesus said you lost if you say I see he said you're blind it's when a man can see his condition and won't out of it those are the people that God can work with oh I so love him I love him because every time I think if he took all that massive darkness all that chaos he said let there be light and everything had to go for myself right into him you just a little a piece of a rock you mean to tell me God can't handle your problem God can transform you he transformed so that you could be planted into it my God and our God is God and when I'm closing that's one thing I did learn from the 10 commandments when the Pharaoh said his God is God I stuck with me amen and think about you and I serve the same God Moses Sarah whoo hallelujah let's just have a word of Prayer father so thank you you're so good to me you've been better to me than I've been to myself and as your people Lord we we know you you're gathering your jewels we know Lord God you're changing us in transforming us Lord we know like Michelangelo you've taken a stone and now you shaping it into your very image we thank you for your grace we think about your mercy just just seeing you in your scriptures and seeing what you're doing with us it gives us great strength and hope it increases our faith and love in you Lord because we realize we don't deserve it Lord we really don't there's nothing good about us not within ourselves nor with fallen creature Lord we're more beasts than man and father you have transformed us by giving us your Holy Spirit by taking your word and recreating us O Lord we haven't come to that place where we desire but we see you changing us from day to day from glory to glory and father we are so thankful more than we can express because I know that all darkness at the end of the day will be expelled from each and every one of our lives we will be the true light will be the reflection the very image of your being Lord I don't know I've never been there before in my own mind but I can hardly wait till you have complete control and complete reflection through us let your perfect will be done out there Jesus we come to glorify you and you are me and in your name Jesus Christ we do trust I have nothing else to trust and all I know is I want to be holy like you are be merciful to us now and let your grace be upon us oh it's for Lima just want to the Frank from Ohio brother Frank when I was there was one of my deacons he's a dear friend of mine anyway we just got report that he had a massive heart attack I was just heart attack amen and so let us follow prayer oh dear Jesus the Lord Satan has attacked my brother in so many ways he attacked him with cancer and Lord you gave him grace to overcome that now Lord God he's just had a heart attack we know this is a different season we've seen the death angel hit a lot of our soldiers and Friends Lord recently God our Father you know I love this man he did a lot for me it's a deep affection for him and I know father that we have to leave at some point in time the Lord even for his wife's sake spare and father raised him up Lord and strengthened him one more time God we believe that you're more than able to do so the father I don't want to pray against your will I know what your words say none consider why the righteous are fallen asleep and that is to keep them further from the homecoming danger the Lord you know how we love we know how the power of our love can keep a person here Lord for a period of time all we asking O God is your will be done we're asking for grace we ask him for his mercy if you can see where you can spare in Lord we ask that you do so let your word have His perfect will and our brother Frank's and his wife family oh god I don't know how to pray I'm just kind of like in a state of shock that this has happened but I just say let your grace be with my brother I will say Amen so continue to have thomas frank in your prayers that God's perfect will be done in his life oh yes yes yeah Judah needs a some prayer we can all actually create for them
