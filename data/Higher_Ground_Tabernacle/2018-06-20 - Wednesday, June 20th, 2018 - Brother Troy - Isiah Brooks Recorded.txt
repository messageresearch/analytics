yesterday is meeting with a colleague of mine in town before we want us to get the customer or not and he hadn't I never I barely ever talked to this gentleman but all of a sudden he started talking to me about his his ex and this what was going on he had been separated for six years and then he started saying you know he says you know start bringing God in the conversation and and started talking how he he started asking me for prayer he says says I need someone to pray for me says I need you know I need that and it was after he was asking things that you know maybe he says ask he's asking for to meet someone he had been you know I've been divorced for six or seven years but he's asking needs help I need to I need to meet with I mean to meet someone need to meet someone that would love me and all that and uh you know I started thinking I said I uh I could preach to this guy and tell him you know started preaching and tell him well you should do this and this and have you done this and this but Lord just the guy just asked me to pray for him it didn't ask me to the judge him and then asked me to correct him didn't ask me for him so just that and so the next morning I was on my knees and and lower brought that right to me and I prayed for him to meet someone you know and it's just that's what the Lord has us here for not necessarily to do it's to love people you know into and God will do the work amen so I just think the Lord kept me in there some other quick thing to lean as Troy miss here Amen learning to lean on Jesus [Music] [Music] oh gee fine power I am birdie let's see that one more time learn to leave [Music] hey how many can testify that's the truth amen amen learning to lean on Jesus amen he's worth lean enough amen there's no no better thing to lean on lean on Jesus amen amen just as we get into the service let's open our Bibles were the Lord to 2nd Peter chapter 3 and we'll read from the eighth verse down to the fifteenth verse learning to lean on Jesus amen we'll speak a message tonight called counting slackness you'll see as that comes from the scriptures here in 2nd Peter second Peter 3 start with the eighth verse and it says but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night and the wish the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall would be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent eat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness where for a look wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent they may be found of him in peace and without spot and blameless and account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation even as our brother put our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him have written unto you amen let's just power hasn't word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for the scripture lord I just ask you Lord that you would allow me father - to speak this and its fullness the way that their just the way that you intended it to be spoken father may there be nothing inside me that would hinder your gospel from going out Lord Lord may there be nothing in the and the hearts of these believers I've assembled here from receiving the word Lord that you speak tonight and I pray Lord that you'd soften every heart Lord to receive your gospel in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen counting slackness the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slots as some men count slackness amen some people when they see a promise they doesn't happen right away and no the raid just discount the promise amen or cancer well he's slower if there's just slow that's not gonna happen but tonight we're gonna really be going through the calendar of God amen God has a calendar and everything happens right on time amen everything happens right in this new season amen nothing is late no nothing is nothing is running behind everything is running just the way God has intended to run amen everything is happening right on God's timepiece right in the time and it's season of when is supposed to happen amen and some people might think well this should happen at this time or maybe this should happen now or or a little bit later or a little bit sooner but but we cannot say anything but what God is going to do it right in his time a man in his time is perfect amen when we submit ourselves to the timing of God amen when it'll all the will discover the peace that passes all understanding Amen because when you begin to think that well maybe God has forgotten his his promise we you can't start counting that as script counting goddess being slack amen as God is is being lazy too to bring his promises to pass amen that's that's speaking of doubt in your own self amen you're no you're no longer operating in faith but you are now operating in doubt amen and the man that operates in doubt will never see anything happen from God amen but the man that operates in faith believing that God will see to his promises that God is watching over his word to see their little it'll come to pass in your life that man is gonna see something a man that God that man will see that God is operating a ride on time ride on time every single thing that he said that he'll do he will do it amen now I got a whirlwind of about four different pastors of scriptures I want to go through here real quick let's turn our Bibles to Luke chapter 24 amen and if I go faster you can turn well you have to turn faster amen Luke 24:49 says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now Jesus Christ was speaking here that to his disciples amen and he is speaking to him right before he gets right before he gets carried away and he's given to them a promise and this promise is going to happen right on God's calendar amen he says I behold I send the promise of my father upon you Amen Jesus has already seen it he already knows what the promise is he's seen it come - he's seen it coming to pass and he's now expressing that to them the word is going forth out of his mouth and it's going to happen right according to God's timing amen he says I'm behold I send the problem of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen and maybe those disciples didn't quite realize it but they were standing right on the pages of God's calendar amen as they are counting off the fifty days you know from the from the Passover that was slain to the day of Pentecost there is going to be a Pentecostal feast Amen there's gonna be a time when the Holy Spirit of God is gonna be poured upon upon our church fathers amen and that then that Holy Spirit of God is gonna do them with power from on high so that they don't have to preach this gospel by themselves a man so they don't have to live this Christian life by themselves so they don't have to try to bear fruit unto God by themselves but know the power from on high is and it come down right up in God's timing on the day Playhouse and it's gonna fill them with the Holy Ghost amen what they do they sit there and they waited and they waited in Jerusalem amen for the promise that God had spoken to them and sure enough when God's countour got to the right position God's Word came to pass just like you said it would amen now let's turn over to Acts chapter 2 verse 39 I got a lot of scriptures I'm just gonna lay a foundation here so stay with me amen Acts chapter 2 verse 39 first we'll start with verse 38 says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call so whenever a man repents and is baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ he is now on the pages of God's calendar amen and God has a promise for that man amen and that man is gonna receive the promise of the Father amen and is gonna be filled with the Holy Ghost amen it's not a different Holy Ghost but it's the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost back there amen is not a different Holy Ghost but is the same because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now it's turned forward a few chapters to Acts 717 this is three out of five scriptures I want to go to Acts 717 it says this talking about the time of Moses there and it says but when the time of the promise drew nigh which God had sworn to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt until another king arose which knew not Joseph Amen the same dealt subtly with our kindred and evil and treated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end that they might not live in which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father's house three months amen and you know the rest of the story God had a promise that was laying out there amen that promise had not been fulfilled yet but it was to be fulfilled upon a certain time because he said that they would be there in 400 years and then God would raise them up a delivery men and so in God's when when God's promise began to meet God's time and time and promise got together amen and they met together on the pages of the calendar the people that were living on that day were blessed they meant why because God's deliver a rose up and delivered his people a man you cannot stop us for God's promises and when time and promise meet together whoever is living on that certain page in time of the calendar they're gonna see the blessings of God amen they're gonna see something and as long as they're patient even as long as they're patient and as they're trusting to the Lord they're gonna see something mighty come to pass whenever people are at a time where time and promise are coming together time promise are meeting together and they're standing on the pages of God's calendar that something is gonna happen amen now let's turn over to Acts chapter 13 verse 23 I'll start with the 22nd verse it says and when he had removed him and raised up unto them David to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will of this man seed of God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus amen God had a promise that he would raise up a man now David came and fulfilled all God's will amen he fulfilled he was a man after David's own heart why did Jesus Christ - he came and fulfilled all God's will why did he do that he did that for us a man he fulfilled the will of God for us then why is he do he sends his spirit down upon us we can now fulfill his will by submitting to his Spirit amen what so the promises of God may affect all right now we'll go down to the last one here acts 26 God has promises that have to come to pass and they kind of pass in God's own timing except six verse 15 Paul said and I said who art thou Lord this is Paul when he was slain on the road Damascus everyone spitting down by the by the light he said who who art thou Lord he said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us ba rise stand upon thy feet for I've appeared under thee for this purpose to make the a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee delivering the from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to oh now here's why he sent him to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me amen that multi-purpose that God was sending st. Paul the same reason that he's also sending us amen he's sending us what to open their eyes to turn them from the darkness to light from the power of Satan unto God and that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them they're sanctified by faith that isn't me hey man if you're struggling with any one of those ions let me tell you you got to go back and read the scriptures over again amen if you're so strongly with understanding forgiveness of sins if you're living underneath the power of Satan instead the power of God you need to come back to the gospel here because there is a promise for you amen now I read all those four for this purpose that God has a lot of promises they're sitting out there amen and God has a calendar for them to happen now God has set forth a pattern for a Christian payment he has a pattern that man when he repents and when he gets baptized in the name with Lord Jesus Christ you are now standing upon the calendar of God amen and God has certain promises that are laid up in store for those that will walk in this truth amen and those promises cannot be taken away amen they they have to come to pass every true believer must walk through those pages of the calendar with God amen it's just like the just like the churn of Israel they had a calendar in that calendar they had the feasts amen and at the beginning in the in the springtime and those feasts had to do with their agricultural seasons amen so what would they do they would go forth in the as they went through their agricultural seasons amen that they have the beginning of the year they'd have their Passover amen the beginning of the earth started with the password everything started with the the Passover guy was I will pass over you that was the when when they had the first Passover the God told them this will be the beginning of the year unto you this will be your New Year's every year when you celebrate the Passover and this will be a forever a covenant unto you through all of your generations that every year that you have from this time forward it will be you'll start your year off with the Passover a manna for a Christian it starts the same way every man when he we first must recognize his atonement amen he first must recognize a lamb there's a lamb slain in the morning every day and there's a lamb slain evening amen every day every day every day they had they had to recognize that their lamb was slain amen and I will write when you when you rise up in the morning amen you have to recognize that there was a lamb slain for you amen rise up off your bed calling upon the name of the Lord Jesus he'll give you songs on your bed of the night you raise up in the morning you recognize your atonement you recognize that there was a lamb slain for you amen and it's a beginning of a new day for you a beginning of a new year for you and when you first become a Christian it's a beginning of a new life for you amen you're the things of the past SAR dead and gone amen you're recognizing your atonement that now God is gonna wipe away your sins as far as East is from the West and I have an atonement for you amen and every household it wasn't just for the priests to do here but every household had to do it and recognized it themselves as soon as every household here must first come to recognize that the Passover lamb has been slain for them Amy if you don't if you have never yet recognized that Jesus Christ died for your sins then you have a yes start upon this journey but what about the first time that you look at that cross amen and you realize that when you feel that conviction upon your heart and you rise oh my I've sinned about when God says turn to me there is a sacrifice for you and that is the beginning of a year for you that has a beginning of a new beginning for you and you're now standing on the pages of God's calendar and there are certain things coming down the road they cannot be they're gonna happen in God's own season for your life amen they have to happen Amen God and God is not slack concerning his promises amen they have to come to pass amen so so so what so let's say so once you go from the Passover on down through the calendar throughout the year the Jewish year they've gone through their winter time and now they're now it's the spring time and they're recognizing their Passover then life starts springing up everywhere amen there's life over here there's life over there or the first thing they celebrate the barley crop and then they begin to celebrate the the wheats and they have to bring forth the patent the firstfruits amen and so whether they do they fertile a start counting off fifty days from the day of Passover amen as soon as they recognize their atonement the very moment that they cling to the cross and they create cling to the blood of the Lamb a time timer starts clicking off in heaven amen amen and it's what is it counting down to that you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you're gonna receive it upon God's own time a man for your life you're gonna receive what are they doing they're counting down in the Jewish counter there is fifty days from the day of Passover to the day of Pentecost 50 days counting down until the Pentecostal feast and the Pentecostal feast was a Pentecostal feast the first time the wheat harvest began to appear amen now I didn't appear everywhere all at once but they appeared on the high places first off upon the mountains on the high places first you can look up to the hills and they're up on the hills as the wheat harvest is starting to in the high elevations as a star to grow a man what do we do we look up to the high places Amy we look up to our fathers our Pentecostal fathers we look up to the first fruits of Pentecost amen and where the fruits first began to appear amen well it was the first it was the first time now first they had the barley cop remember and the barley crop has leaven in it amen so what they do they had the right at the time of the Passover they had a barley crop amen so they've recognized their atonement and the fruits are coming up are still mixed with leaven amen all the time the fruits are still mixed with lemon from that time over they're counting off till the day of Pentecost Aemon but once the day of Pentecost appears now we're beginning to see the firstfruits of the wheat harvest and the we harvest doesn't have leaven and amen so so the so the so the so the wheat when the wheat is also in harvest now we begin to recognize fruits that are appearing amen that are not leavened by the sins of our flesh why because we've been sealed with a baptism of the Holy Ghost now we're no longer working upon our own flesh if anybody's ever remembered about the time of back before you have filled with the Holy Ghost amen trying does when you first trying to serve God with all your might trying to do the things that are right and you're in yours mixed with your own work so you just don't can't seem to get up but all sudden God comes down amen and he seals you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he fills you with the Holy Ghost then sudden what all sudden the the the acts that happened in your life what is it it's a new harvest in your life now it's no longer the fruits of something else but but as God's fruits are springing up in your life amen amen and yo you know as you go down through God's calendar you know brother Brahimi in the first he preached there in the in the Feast of Trumpets but then he appreciate again and question answers later but he was talking about the Feast of Trumpets he talks about that passage of time from Pentecost on down to the feast of the trumpets and when I was looking I was reading through I've been studying through that the last several days and through the agricultural because because you had the first the the wheat crop the firstfruits of the wheat crop was on the day of Pentecost they took the firstfruits and they harvested from the high elevations and they waived it before the Lord amen and the wheat spoke of Jesus Christ himself a mint they waved before the Lord so what that happens so then it's from that time on down through month after month as you're getting towards the Feast of the trumpets the the wheat crop begins maturing on the lower and the lower and the lower elevations amen amen and so now this not just those on the hike tops but now everybody is beginning to experience not just those back in the day of Pentecost but as time goes on everybody is because experiencing their wheat crop on in their due season amen amen in their own due season and now we've had what 7 church ages 7 months as brother branham said 7 months and then seventh months was the day of trumpets everybody when you get to the to the feast of the trumpets now everybody and every month at every elevation has experienced their their their crop of wheat everybody has expressed at your neighbor who who lived on the higher plane and he was able to bring his firstfruits over to the priests amen but now you yourself you yourself have experience in your own season in your own day in your own age you have your own crop of wheat every man must have his own his own fruit in its due season amen because in the land of Judea was a hilly land and crops matured at different elevations at different times a man so the man that lived down here in in Bethlehem or in Jericho would receipt would have his fruit mature at different time than those that lived up in Jerusalem amen because because of Bethlehem and Jericho will be at different elevations amen and so so the same thing is we at different ages than the apostles receive our own crop in its due season time and promise meet together in our lives just like time and promise met together for them in their season amen and so Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen now as soon as as soon as that first fruit amen was was snipped off there in the in the third month they had the the Passover is in the first month the the Feast of Pentecost is in the third month and then the Feast of Trumpets is in the seventh month and the Feast of the trumpets was the end of all harvests everything has been harvested every crop every grape every barley every every every everything all everything has been harvested at that time amen but but there's a space of time between the between the the firstfruits of the wheat and the Feast of the trumpets and there's a long season there and it's their hot season it's their dry season and a sudden heat shows up and and all of a sudden as the Sun begins beating down and and and paint away elevation you can start having a hard time with your fruits but but God said I will give you rain and it's due season hey man we're going at that scripture here in a little bit but God said I will give you rain and Dew season if you receive the rain and Dew season then you'll be safe from the heat that is gonna come amen amen so that passage of time know that during the seven church ages those that are that lift the hot season a mint we've all had our season and heat amen but what are we doing we're coming down to the coast of the piece of Trumpets now amen we're in the seventh months amen we're coming to that we're in the seventh church age we're coming to our own due season hey man were the last to receive their wheat harvest a man and now now and when when through out though that period of season lots of things become start popping up in the agricultural because first they have their wheat amen and then they have their then they have their the grapes and then they have their figs and then they have their walnuts but then they have their but then all of a sudden in the we've gone through the first month the third month but then the fifth month all of a sudden now that the grapes begin to appear and they begin to make the oil and the wine right before the right before they get to the month they get in the six months they start getting the grapes harvesting the grapes and things start making their oil in their wine amen because they because the grapes and the and olives mature at the same time amen so what do we do right here at the right here at the end is we're we've gone to our dry season amen and we're beginning to harvest the oil in the grapes and as we're entering to the Laodicean age Nelson the oil is being poured upon the church amen she's experienced her dry season through the church ages but God says I I have not left myself without a witness amen I'll pour out myself again and you know I send out my olive I'll send out my oil I'll send out that's why if that's we promise to the Laodicean church I will have eye salve for you I'll have an anointing for you I'll give it to you and it'll save you from the things that are gonna happen in Laodicea amen amen let's turn over to Leviticus chapter 26 it has everything that happens in its own due season amen Leviticus 26 we'll read the third verse there in it and says if you will walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments and do them then I will give you rain and Dew season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach under the vintage and the vintage shall reach under the sowing time now look look what's saying there your threshing what's the threshing that's the threshing of the week Amen so at the very beginning of the time when the first fruits are threshed out that that meat will last you all the way to the middle layer cultural season to win the victory when the grapes are period in the fifth month a man when the grapes are appearing to the fifth month that will reach all the way until the sowing time which is clear over in the eighth month clear over past the Feast of Trumpets amen and so that you will have your you shall eat your bread in full and dwell in your land and safely throughout the whole year I will foresee it to you amen the entire year I will watch over to you amen the meat will reach from season to season verse six and I will give peace in the land you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid amen I'll read evil beasts out of the land and either show the sword go through your land you shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword five of you shall chase a hundred a hundred shall put show you of you shall put down ten thousand amen and your enemies shall fall by you by the sword for I will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish you establish my covenant with you why because they kept established statutes and keep his Commandments how do you keep God's statutes the only way to do it is to is to be filled with the Holy Ghost and to walk in the spirit every day that's the only way to do it he said I will write my statutes upon your heart amen and what was I doing your your life will go through even through the dry seasons I will have bread for you month in month out month in month out amen amen now let's turn or to Joel chapter two so the Jews has a march through there through their calendar they would every time they had to give thanks for every fruit amen Joel - Joel - jab chapter 2 verse 23 and it says be glad they need children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately on the heel cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat in the fats shall overflow why Noah and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cake of worm and the caterpillar and the palm war my great army which I sent among you and he shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen so think about what the Jews have experienced year after year they celebrated the Passover hundreds thousands of years they celebrated the Passover and and it was testifying that Jesus Christ would show up on the earth amen but at the very moment that their Passover came that they came to celebrate their Passover the last time amen and when they're supposed to turn the corner and receive Christ and they missed it amen they the God's calendar for them stopped when they rejected Christ amen they were and they were to receive Christ and I was supposed to set off a chain of events amen and it's supposed to start ticking off a calendar so they could go from receiving it someday and they went from there to Pentecost amen and they received there that they received the Holy Spirit amen but for the Jews that it stopped for the Jewish nation they rejected Christ and it stopped right there their whole calendar was put on pause and so what happened to us the calendar was opened up to us and every single one of us has been preached to us the gospel a man going down age after age after ages has said to Paul there that to go and preach the promise unto them amen to turn them from the power of Satan unto power of God and that four Gospels in priest year after year and every man as soon as they receive as soon as they receive their atonement the calendar starts clicking off in their life amen you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man you over see now a few errs down a few now if you start counting God as slack concerning his promises and you're in doubt and you're never gonna receive it Amen you can't receive the Holy Ghost if you're doubting amen but one man when he wants four pence amen and all those programs said all the sins are chopped off right there amen you repent and then and then a man takes you into the waters say mint and you were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you come up out of that water amen where two are standing good Jesus Christ Himself said where two on earth our tests are on this earth or testify of any one thing what you bind on the earth I will bind it in the heavens a man went to stand in the water amen and you were baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ so you come up you're both testifying this man is dead to himself and he's alive under Christ Jesus a man at that point that point on what you testify on earth God testifies her in heaven well you bind there on the earth in the water he binds up in the heavens a man was it doest that binding starts a calendar Amos starts a process that if you trust in the Lord and you look unto Him in faith not in doubt you're not as we said in second Peter they're three we God is not slack concerning his promises but he will send the promise of the Holy Ghost upon you amen what do you what do you do you just wait for the calendar to come your way for the calendar Lord send down your promise Lord send down your promise Lord we've we've recognized here we've recognized the Passover amen and you keep looking at that lamb Laura we're waiting for the day of Pentecost anyway we're waiting for that by a rushing wind in my life Lord I'm Way Lord I'm trusting in your blood Lord I i'm trusting i'm counting all these things as dung amen i've separate all the foolishness of my life out amen I'm rejecting the things of Satan and I'm alive under Christ Jesus amen and I'm waiting for the time of the promise it's got to happen it has to happen it has to have why because God's calendar says it's going to happen you're standing at the time where time and promise are coming together your time and promise are joining together in your life and things have to happen every man in the last six thousand years when they've stood upon God's calendar and time and promise join together something happened amen it happened to Noah it happened to Moses it happened to Enoch it happened to every single one of them and we are standing here right on God's calendar amen and we're standing here right before the Feast of the trumpets amen and one day in a moment in a twinkling eye the trumpet shall sound amen and now what what's going to do is the trumpet is going to call the Jews together them together amen but we also going to be gathered together amen why because we have received a voice amen we received it we received a shout a shot went out it gathered a message called us and gather us together and I want to do is said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it said repent and be baptized in the name with Lord Jesus Christ so you could stand here and wait upon God's calendar was brother Brown trying to do he's trying to catch us up to where we are on the calendar amen why because the bride was running behind where the calendar was amen the calendar was approaching amen World War one the calendar was approaching the time of the Jews a man so in the in World War one the time of the Jews was getting ready to where he said we got to seal that my servants in their foreheads amen all my all my servants we got together my servants the Jews - to the promised land amen and when all the forces of all the lands start gathering together and a war to end all wars the Great War in 1917 100 years ago and everything was gathering together and all sudden wait stop the bride has not been sealed yet amen the bride has not all these names that have been bent I testified before the foundation of the world I haven't come to fruition yet a man just just hold on eleventh hour the eleventh hour people hold on stop everything stop right there and all sudden all fighting a disease a man 11th month 11th day 11th hour all fighting had to cease amen and and all sin the Jews had a moment of respite Ament as well you know though the prophets are gonna - prophets are gonna come and explain all these trumpets - in a little while a man I mean I mean I understand it because they haven't explained it to me but I have a feeling that has something to do with it amen amen amen so what's it doing God is trying to catch his bride up to where we ought to be according to the calendar amen we are supposed to be somewhere why because we have to have all of our fruits in our new seasons amen every member of the Bride of Christ has to have her fruits in their due seasons we all have to have faith we all have to have virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness we gonna have brotherly kindness one for another amen we have to care one for the other amen if you don't care for your brother or your sister then you you're running behind God's calendar amen what is what we're a hundred years past God's put the whole thing on hold waiting for us to catch up to where the calendar says that we ought to be a we're at the lowest elevation amen air Bayless has all received their harvest amen but we're waiting for us to receive the same harvest that they received back on the day of Pentecost at the Pentecostal feast and when and we cannot have a Feast of Trumpets until the harvest is completed amen because the feast of the trumpets during that seven in that seventh month there is a quick succession there on the first day of the seventh month on the seventh day of the seventh of the seventh month on the tenth day the Centro there's a quick succession a feast and they all have to do with the harvest we're celebrating that the harvest has been finished the harvest has been completed all the fruits have been gathered in all of the grapes have ever been grown I've been grown amen every all of that was ever gonna be grown has now been grown amen every single member of the Bride of Christ has the wine and the oil in their life Jesus God he said do not hurt the wine or the oil why do I don't know realize what was happening there in the in the uh what age was the wine and oil v H am i right it's somewhere in there hey what was happening in the fifth H in the fifth month that's in the fifth month was that well that was the dry the hot season amen the the oil and the wine was at risk amen but your voice went out do not hurt the wine or the oil then a wine or oil member the what we read there Leviticus the vintage will last amen the bar the wheat crop will last from the day of Pentecost aren't into the vintage in the fifth age Amen and then the vantage will last from the all the way on through the fifth all the way into the Feast of the trumpets a man so there's God to why because there's got to be can't hurt the wine in the oil there's got for you wine or oil throughout at all why so that those that are down in the lower elevations amen those are in the Laodicean age that haven't received their wheat crop yet amen they have to have a wine in oil all the way until the denon our harvest a mess or is it when those they're staying at the end of God's calendar they still have to receive every fruit of every harvest Amen why because there when the through n'e when the Feast of the trumpets comes in seventh months when the seventh angel sounds the mystery of God is finished amen and everybody has to have received has to have received their harvest amen where do they head where they have to have the fruits in their life when the seventh ain't when the mystery is finished amen everybody has to have their fruits in their life amen when the last trumpet sounds when the voice of God goes out and the bride goes up the rapture everybody has to have their fruits on display amen if you don't have your fruits on display then you're speaking contrary to what God's calendar said amen buy it though because when the fruit when the when the trumpet shall sound amen but although everything's been brought in everything's been brought in all of our faith has been brought in every faith that's ever gonna grow has been brought in for the Bride of Christ all the virtue has been brought in every virtuous ever gonna happen it's done amen all of these fruits are sealed unto the Bride of Christ all of our know it's all of our temperance all our patience amen and if you are lacking these things and you haven't caught up to God's calendar yet God's calendar is marching on marching on marching on and what are we doing we're coming up to the time of the rapture what happens at the time of the rapture think about it though what let me go back to our seventh month here on this seventh month on the first day of the month we have the Feast of the trumpets amen on the tenth day of the month we have the Day of Atonement and then on the 15th day of the seventh month we have the Feast of the in gathering or the Feast of the Tabernacles amen so on the fern once we get to that first day of the seventh month the Feast of Trumpets amen it's time amen the was time to reap Lau the fields amen all the harvesting is done it's finished amen it's finished we cannot grow anything else the we're not going to be working on our patience anymore we won't be working on our brotherly kindness anymore amen let he who is Phil they'd be filthy still that human that is right just be righteous still Amen why because it's now harvest time if it hasn't been it's time to reap all the fields that's when they came through at the time of the harvest say to heart bringing their harvest and then go through and replay all the fields everything's plowed under if there was a plan out there that just wasn't quite mature yet he got plowed under a man and went back to the dust from where it came from amen and it's why because the see that season is now past amen we're now at the time of the trumpets Amen so so so remember at the robe and said what's gonna what's it gonna be there's gonna be a shout amen a voice and a trumpet a shout a voice and trumpet brother Branham said a shot went out it was a message a message and was to gather the Bride of Christ together amen what is it doing it's right there at the last day of the six-month he's right there coming to the first day of the seventh month or right at the lat we're right on the knife edge where there shouldn't be any light left any light left for this age everything's been put on pause waiting for us to receive our final our final fruits there's almost no time left to gather the fruits in for the harvest and we have this much time left for the fruits we have this much time for brotherly kindness we have this much time for to have all the virtues in our life and that's how much time we have left why because what's what's tomorrow tomorrow is what the trumpet amen we're right there right at the in Saints we have to catch up to God's calendar a man we have to have the sealing of the Holy Ghost amen we have to have all that we have to have the token on display a man we have to have all the fruits of God and our life everything that the Holy Spirit was supposed to do in our lives we have to have that that that that on display in our lives amen you go ahead do that through prayer and reading your Bible amen constant prayer and reading your Bible prayer and reading your Bible if you miss that then you're missing a harvest in your life amen and what fruits will you present to him on that day amen remember Jesus he he was walking through the down the road one day and he went up to a fig tree knee and he went up together amen it was a season when the figs were supposed to be on display in the tree amen and he went and he went to growgrip he looked part of the leaves and cards some more leaves and there was no figs upon the tree and the very season that tree was supposed to be get was displaying its fruits he went to go look for it he was expecting for the fruits and to harvest it and it wasn't there it wasn't there he said they cursed the tree and dried up and withered and died amen and so there are many that are supposed to have fruits on this last day why because by the time when but by the first day of the seventh month you have to have all your fruits on display amen and what does it do amen when Jesus I mean when the shout goes out it gathers the bride you come bring your fruits and then when the voice or no when the when the voice goes out come gather your fruits get them together now come on we're going get you get you ready remember the when the bridegroom Christ you know trim your lamps get ready we're going to the wedding it's time now you've been waiting here long enough trim your lamps let's shine light all the way to the wedding amen amen amen it's time amen amen we cannot stop God's calendar the the approaching of the trumpet Feast it was put on pause for us amen and now the Jews have gone through all that they've gone through without the Holy Ghost amen they went through the World War two without the Holy Ghost they went through all that but God's gonna be a time where God takes the Holy Ghost and once we go up in a rapture amen and then the Holy Ghost switches over to them amen no more fruits for you amen amen we that's who that's when the harvest is over for the Bride of Christ and it was it doing she's she was gathered together underneath the shout amen and then the voice comes out a mess turn it over to John chapter 11 is my last scripture here John chapter 11 verse 33 and says when Jesus therefore saw her weeping the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him and they said to him Lord come and see and Jesus Jesus wept then said the Jew is behold how he loved him amen our going to verse 38 and it says Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave and it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and jesus said take ye away the stone hey no no no there's there's what's going on here there's a message going out amen take away the stone let him out amen and then what happens nothing Jesus cries out verse 43 and when he had thus spoken he cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes amen and then what loose him set him free and let him go amen there was a shout a voice in a trumpet there's there so when Jesus he was he doing his groaning in the Garden of Gethsemane amen he was he was groaning he was crying news is Whateley was due he died in the atonement was what was born out a mint and what do we do we recognize the atonement we are catching up with God's calendar amen we're catching up what was the message of our day we're recognizing what that slain lamb for our day the slain word for our day really meant amen the mysteries are being revealed unto us remember we're recognizing what those mysteries are the mysteries of being fish or life amen we've recognized the atonement Amen we've been called in today told me and what did he do he was they do he goes out and he cried and he gathers her together he what to turn you from the power of Satan unto the power of God we're not supposed to be living in these dead bodies hey man we got a rapture we got to go to Amen well one of these days a revelation is gonna strike us though we shouldn't be living in these bodies anymore amen a short quick pain and we'll be out of them amen you know the rapture will be a revelation amen it'll be something that's going to all sudden quicking within us amen and all sudden it'll be a OBS P that's why they call our rapture amen if you--if you know what that rapture meant that word meant back in the eighteen hundreds Amen if it's a marvelous thing Amen it was it was a we were caught up in in a euphoria you're caught up why because you realize something something's revealed to you all sudden all the scales are away from your eyes amen amen that which is there's been covered over in this and this mask of flesh amen as we as we go up in a moment in a twinkling in and I we chose Amen as we see him amen amen shallow voice Trump amen amen you don't have to be dead in your sins anymore you don't have to even be alive in Christ come up to a wedding supper amen we're called they're called to a feast of mourning amen but we're called to a feast of rejoicing with him amen I will restore unto you all the years why why is he restore all the years of the local Satan I had to catch you up with his calendar amen God has a calendar and he cannot stop it that says Alaska plus let's just hear him close and turn back to 2nd Peter no we were there at the beginning second Peter 3 verse 9 says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance Amen what in other places said repentance of dead works Amen so after you repent of all the dead works what do you do you come to the living works how do they come to the living works by the baptism of the Holy Ghost every man is called right now to come to the living works a man to live unto Christ Jesus a man go why because the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night amen what are we waiting for in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and we shall be changed amen verse 13 it says nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness amen brother Branham said that was an allegory that the same process and in future home the same process that the earth went through the bride is going through amen what we do we are baptized amen in Noah's baptism amen we were when when the blood of Christ spilled upon the earth we were we were our toment was made a mint and as the earth is getting ready for his fire baptism we have already received our fire baptism so that we won't be burned up in the fire that is to come amen amen shout voice Trump where we are be filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen scene verse 11 scene then all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved in elements shall melt with fervent Heat amen that's also speaking of what our lives is supposed to go through I mean we're supposed to experience so that when we experience the baptism the Holy Ghost if we miss that burning fire that were the elements of our own passions of our own sins of our own foolish ways that that fire that comes down and melts all that out of the way if you miss that then you're not prepared to meet up with God's calendar amen a man looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat a man nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth where dwelleth righteousness a malice tan verse 14 said wherefore beloved seen you look for these things be diligent they may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless a man why because on the day of the calendar at the point of time Christ will come the trumpet shall sound and we shall gather all of our fruits together amen and meet him in the air amen why because we ain't taking this flesh with us amen no what are we taking with us we're taking our fruit statement and we the the rapture
