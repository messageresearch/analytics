foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] thanks to me foreign [Music] God oh yes [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God laughs Hallelujah you know I've got to have one of these when I get there [Music] it was a dream of my life but in this dream I saw it alsoever the Lord Jesus and we were entering into the Gates of Heaven [Music] it was there when I saw the gate close [Music] family and Jesus stood there and I saw a lot of people just rejoicing going into the gate and the whole time he was staring at me not watching the other people and I was wondering what that was I wasn't in the message at that time but now I do understand what the dream was all about circular empathy I believe with all my heart that the dream was of the Lord until he'll have it to you because in a in a split second so when everybody else moved in I stood there Jesus in me and before oh I could think a good thought yeah I was right in front of him and he took me by the waist and my people like a man with a woman and he Lifted Me Up and he kissed me on my lips see my um I woke up shouting and praising God want you and the anointing of God was so on me I ran out of my room into my mother's room and I told her of my dreams I'm really scared her because it was in the middle of the night and she said praise the Lord the Lord is called my son to preacher that was the worst thing she could have said to me because I never wanted to be a preacher never wanted to be a pastor foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my life became miserable and the last stupid thing I ever did Daniel's so stupid I had a gun to my head it's a very large trying to kill myself and God would not let the gun go off memories it was very frustrating to give him offers I said Lord if you don't kill me tradition somebody will kill me or I will kill myself [Music] God heard my cry and he saved me according to his grace hey my soul I know what it means to be in bondage I know what it means to be delivered [Music] so that's why I'm here I'm here for a purpose and I will not let anything even myself get in the way of what the purpose of God is in my life [Music] as we stand on some double we're going to ask that you turn with us [Music] to two passages of scripture we have been uh dealing with the order of God's things um and God has an order even this world has an order memorandum your family has an order whatever everything has an order to it whether we like it or not and those instructions this is instructional should be uh instructions of Correction the Methodist instruction The Collection you love the Lord Revelation 16 and 7. uh apocalypse says A7 sh and from Revelation 16 to 7 The Apocalypse says the apocalypse says it said then we'll we'll go to Psalms 19 and 7. [Music] some this enough is that as we know our ability is Paul is not the one that normally comes up only foreign and I heard and and I heard another out of the altar say even so Lord God Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments is used to Psalms 19 and 7. some of these nervous sets appreciate everyone that's here this morning Psalms 19 and 7 Psalm business the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple some it's eight here it's eight sorry um let us pray father God we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for being so good to us Heavenly Father well Celeste we pray father God that you would give us ears to hear could you receive your word on this morning forgive us of our sins forgive us of our shortcomings us oh God from all of our unrighteousness and may your Holy Spirit move upon this audience Lord in a special way amen amen you may be seated foreign I cannot express the urgency how many of us this morning fought the devil before you got here um well at least I'm going to raise my hand and tell on him this was really in my mind every day you have a battle with the devil sex jealous and if you don't have a battle you're stupid that means you're not in a Warner like yeah but when I think about it this end time message and what God did through our prophet and circled and how he labored to get this message to us for those of us who have heard the message on the wings of a snow white dove Don Colombo Blanche combination you heard how brother Branham was Advantage tells the story about this Dove that was the six column to bring a message and how the dove was wounded in battle and you can tell that brother Branham was speaking of his own himself and the struggles he's had and his employees bringing this message to us matter of fact at the end of that particular message brother Brandon is literally crying I can feel the pain I could feel the hurt I can hear the sincerity but one of the things that really caught my attention in spite of the wounded dove burn Parts brother Brandon said the message got home so in this day we know that there are some people who are not going to be heroes of the word but also doers yes brother Adam tells us in spiritual food in due season he said there is nothing left but judgment and he said when we step over judgment he tells us amen that the the line of Mercy let me read it like he said there's nothing left but judgment when you step over the line of Mercy records and when I think about the mercies of God Mercy is when you're guilty that means they're called conversation you've been judged you've been tried and you're guilty and you receive Mercy that means that he calls hallelujah hallelujah now in this warning he was trying to share with us that there's coming a time when the grace of God is shut off hello I will say it again he was trying to warn us that's this amazing grace that we sing about because it's right Grace is not eternal hello Grace is not Eternal Grace was given to us after the fall apart amen amen and we find out that when Jesus died he was literally dying for you and me Hallelujah this is why we can sit here today proclaiming to be Christians and we're still living it's because we have lived all of the grace and mercy of God but God has an order somehow Grace can run out La graspe uh is that not what brother random said God will continue to warn you and warn you and warn you and he said but there is a line once you cross over the line God will no longer warn you and the only thing left for you is Judgment Hallelujah just the other day I preached on the key to full Authority and power clearly full so that you'll understand God took us out of what we call the Pentecostal realm or the Pentecostal age per se and when he brought us out he brought us out with a new message and with the new message comes a new song yeah Universal songs is that right because remember when Moses took the children of Israel out of Egypt once they got over on the other side they sung a new song Hallelujah and she began to worship God in a new way Hallelujah see they may have worshiped God in Egypt on Egypt but they were worshiping under the uh under bondage Hallelujah but when when they came over you understand me when it came over and they saw the enemy dead there was no boundaries Moses began to sing a new song Hallelujah is that right and we remember the prophet of God she began prophetess of God Miriam she began to play her tambourine millions of women with their voices shouting and praising God hallelujah it was not a quiet moment Karma Hallelujah when the lamb took the book I'm jumping now but when the land took the book first of all we realized there was no man worthy no man worthy you're not worthy you weren't worthy I was not worthy to take the book or to lose the seals Hallelujah and there was John who typed out the Bride of Jesus Christ hello somebody he was concerned because John himself knew he was not worthy but then John Heard a Voice for the lion of the tribe of Judah he had prevailed see I can tell you heard this before or was I protected but nevertheless I'm going to preach again because when I get to certain parts you're gonna wish you had listened listening you had paid attention to what I'm preaching but nevertheless let's move on when when when the lamb took the book this is what I'm working with something was different because remember when when John goes on kneel to the angel the angel who was not God told John to get up and worship God only so this is establish a fact that everything in heaven worship God and God Alone Hallelujah so when the bloody lamb came and took the book a pillow Leaf what happened uh what happened the elders ladies and 24 Elders took their crowns off their faces you understand me because the Angels would not have bowed to Jesus things that hinder our growth this surely shows Hallelujah and we've been trying to tell you the things that will hinder your growth are the things that you need to get rid of them Hallelujah there is a key to Authority yeah there's a key to power yeah Hallelujah is that right yes and the Bible tells us that Jesus gave Peter the Kings hallelujah what was the king he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive what everyone said the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost only comes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there were many people because in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but they did not understand but you're not even truly in the message until you come to that Hallelujah you understand me and if you didn't repent you still have not come Hallelujah because you must repeat it Hallelujah is that right if you just got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you went down a wet Center was that and you came up I mean you went down a dry sitter and you came up a wet sinner oh is that that live that's God's father Hallelujah you love the Lord what do you mean brother Adam I don't in the beginning had full Authority and power over the Earth Hallelujah but the second Adam had full authority of Heaven and Earth Hallelujah and we are created and made after the second Adam who is Jesus Christ himself what am I trying to tell you you cannot remain in the condition that you are in conditions Hallelujah somebody help me here because remember the spirit or the anointing of this age has come to deceive a lot of people this uh you may have come to this America with life but the Bible said that the cares of this world if you're not careful you understand what I'm saying you can get so busy trying to be something in this world and you forget the most important thing and that is the world to come let me go on now full Authority and power so when Adam and Eve they lost Authority and power and what was that they lost the nature of God and throughout all of man's history they tried to come back to the state from which they had fallen but they could never do it even when God worked with Israel they did everything right he's always said he's of two faces some of them do Paul said he was blameless Hallelujah the Rich Young Ruler said I did everything right Hallelujah you see it's not enough to know the message he knows the word he knows the words that's got nothing to do with it but do you know Christ have you been born again do you have the Holy Spirit because that's where the life is baptize your mind he will place himself in your head in your heart that's where God resides because the Bible says out of the heart knows the issues of Life uh so these leaves Hallelujah you love that amen I'm going on now remember I said before my whole aim more on objective my desire if you see this church on one Accord get rid of all of the crazy stuff Hallelujah hello get rid of all of the crazy stuff all over this religion that you think you had religion is just a covering Pharisees had coverings when Jesus came he was a discerner of the heart and he said you you look like white as cut separate on the outside white is supplicant on the outside you look good but inside you're a Dead Man's Bones was that uh you love the Lord I'm gonna go you're gonna find this to be really simple when I finish but you cannot love God if you don't love your brothers and I'm not talking about video love if you're good to me I'll be good to you seriously but I'm talking about the kind of love that has the power to change to turn your cheek the Bible says if a man slap you ready I wouldn't dare try it with any of you see turn the cheek what are you saying make another decision turn from the decision that you may have thought to give back another slap yourself we ought to make excuses oh I'm in the right area I know I'm hitting right right right right let's go to Genesis 4 9. I'm not gonna stay in this game but I've got to get this first because let me say it like this you ready yesterday that comes to see I don't care what someone else has done to you you wrong what what someone else has done wrong to you okay you need to love your soul more than you hate someone I'm gonna say it again I don't care is there more food what someone else has what someone has done wrong to you the circle can't come with that fair though you need to love your soul I'm more than you love to hate someone am I making sense you understand me I'm a company because we realize amen nothing unclean will enter into it you love God Amen y'all believe that God is trying to build character in us and this is what I'm trying to say God is trying to build characters I I want you to I don't take sides with people my enemy is not flesh and blood my enemy is spiritual wickedness is and there is not one person in here I Wouldn't Die for um whether you're right or wrong that's correct and God is my judge for that first of all I'm not afraid to die and I know I have the eternal life of God in Me it's his will in me you understand me Genesis 4 please 9-10 this is just portions if you have been here I'm laying out something that was at least that you must see because we sang that song Oh Lamb of God sweet Lamb of God and we sang that song and and one of the the the end of the verses just do what you need to do until I'm just a lamb of God the physical truth whatever it takes to make me a lamb of God I was talking the other day saying even in my house we have to lay out right down do they've only seen no no no and one of my children was having problems on her job it underneath the problem and you know I don't know whether she understood you know hurt herself when I was saying certain things I could you know yeah you hear that that means if somebody do me bad on the job I'm gonna do them bad too okay why do you think God put you on that job he put you there to be a light yeah hello somebody let's read it beginning at the ninth verse and the Lord said unto Cain is where is where is Abel thy brother night first ninth verse and he said I know yeah am I My Brother's Keeper Guardian so now I'm going to ask you this morning are you your brother's keeper you answer that within your soul am I yeah yeah I'm not playing church I'm serious about what I'm doing and what I'm doing is trying to help you the secretary how many of us well let me say like this last week and the week before last when I was here yeah I use the illustration of maturity is and I shared that maturing is it is important for them and I use the illustration of how when you're spanking a child or in adolescence that's immature they're going to think that you're being mean to them oh they'll think that you are punishing them because they don't understand that you have judged the situation and your judgment has to bring correction you understand what I'm saying but once you mature you realize that the Judgment has been true Elizabeth said it's not going to rain for three and a half years until I call for it that was the Judgment of the Lord Israel had been really wicked Ahab and Jezebel and all of that accomplishes our belly but in the midst of all of that if a man was to look at your god Jehovah is my God and they would say how can Jehovah do this the animals are dying the rivers are drying up the jobs are shutting down everything is in a bad situation but that was still Jehovah you understand me this little woman sits a shunamite woman Hallelujah she didn't complain ing because because and when Elijah said give me don't more food first Hallelujah do you think this lady was a big plunk lady no she was skinny no doubt she was starving because the Bible says that she said to her son it's gonna be our last meal we'll eat it and we'll die Hallelujah you understand me but no matter what this woman went through hell she held her respect toward God hallelujah immature Christian will say Lord why me Hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah I look at people don't know I used to be really really really poor because here in America go without a weak food no food for a whole week we used to feed ourselves with water when we could but foreign of course you make up your own sandwich Festival sandwich we usually have bread that would moldier you peel the mole off it comes only available and you eat the bread something dropped on the ground you pick it up dust it off an idiot we're playing this a lot of marshes now we throw everything in the trash [Applause] Hallelujah cause you know the best part was the part that would fall Hallelujah holes in my shoes didn't get number one pair a year uh um have we forgotten look what God has done well God this is we got food to waste now that's still the Judgment of God God find favor UPS living room foreign anybody can go to the store and buy something for a dollar that's okay even at the dollar store is no longer a dollar remember the dollar storage I'm just saying now my point is this I'm going to something here am I my brothers keep us yes you are yeah we who's that the Bible says you are Jesus says and we are supposed to take care of each other Hallelujah you understand me and when we take care of each other we are not supposed to talk about each other in a negative way the Bible said bless and curse not and every time you speak evil against your brother laying a curse on him ammo I'm talking about you you talking about making a Rapture understand God has your life in his in his hands he will lead you like Lambs oh he's going to drive you like a cattle I want to be led like a lamb I don't want to be driven Hallelujah listen equity it I I brought out last week last month that hatred is murder when you hate someone Jesus said it's just like murdering someone [Music] is that the word that's the Bible the Bible said if you hate your brother now be ready it's like being a murderer as I said last week magnified along with me what what is the law he is the word magnify the law with me Hallelujah Jesus in this day came to magnify the words for the Bride of Jesus so that she will be without spots Hallelujah so no longer will she be Sanctified In the Flesh she'll be Sanctified in the spirit and she'll be Sanctified in her songs is that right because the Pharisees needed to know something and the Pharisees of this message need to know something Hallelujah he said listen if a man looked upon a woman in his heart he has already committed what was he doing he was magnifying the Lord magnifying the words taking it from the flesh realm and bringing it down into spiritual reality and if it's hard if it's difficult to overcome adultery or fornication In the Flesh how much more is more difficult to overcome it in the spirit when can only spree yes yes you know because nobody can't see what you're doing spiritually basketball and you don't know I'll be watching everything it would say you're like God too he's upselled too see we look at it I'm gonna read a few more I'm not gonna keep it really really long you'll be long potato yes will I stay right on time when everybody start coming on time you see when I say about 45 minutes back up to an hour you know and then somebody else they come in 45 minutes late that means I gotta go 45 minutes long okay all right y'all know I love you right what's up I do love you I say things to make you smile sometimes listen but you and I must understand this this is what first John message 11 and 16. owns it says okay those of you got your Bibles turned to your Bibles and those who got your iPhone 30. I page the 11th verse says for this is the met that the message because that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another Cane is who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother because his own Works were evil and his brother's righteous how many of us have ever heard the phrase it takes one to know one in person usually those who pointing fingers [Music] are are guilty as well you see what I'm saying so you and I must understand all I'm trying to get us to see them let me say it like this song remember I told you about racism right and I explained to you in the beginning it was not racism it was tribalism because people came from different tribes they began to build walls and one tribe thought they were better it's only in this modern day I think it was um Christopher Columbus discovered America in what 1849. I can't remember 1642. 14 1492. that was when that was when uh uh it began to get become racial in racism in America but anyway let me let me get back to this let me ask you a question the Garden of Eden where was it located it was located in Africa is that right that's the voice that's the beginning that means that all of us are Africans Africa there is Africa it don't make no difference how your color changed Expressions because you go all the way back to the origin and that's where it comes from remember in the towel of Bible all of us look alike until God changed the language then after he changed the language there was a continental divide yeah and individually continue and then it was during that time those who were in Asia took on the Asian look and those numbers and those who went up north chains God way of changing things that's exactly where it is what it is a Pakistani in this the other day I say well where did the original man started he said in Africa I said didn't we all Africans y'all so quiet it doesn't matter what everybody looks like we had one Mama um that's why Bob said one blood in One race One race Universe you can break it up to three I'm sure I'm in Jefferson same blood ma'am song oh come on folks you gotta understand that when we get to heaven God is going to have us all kinds and colors and all in one big group Hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses a white man Jesus Christ there is no such thing as a superior race damn it if there be a superior race it'd be the bride oh Lord y'all don't like it y'all even scared to say Amen remember hallelujah look where the world has brainwashed us and you're really brainwashed if you think being black and it's gonna separate you because you live in a different country or whatever color you may be I got off on something I need to bit back on my thoughts but my whole point is I'm trying to Bring It Back Into Love let me tell you how I know it's possible with different tribes because there's a Time Israel with 12 tribes Israel and they loved each other they fought with each other you understand me when the enemy came in the trumpet sounded like trumpets Hallelujah one a group of eat go out and group the regular drop it with sound the ones who under the ax would go out there the man y'all understand me those Guardian Angels says God those those people who protected the Ark of the covenants when Israel was in Harmony and nothing could defeat them uh because there's only one human being atoma let me say this when I get up here to sing I don't care if you don't accept it I like it when you do but I ain't singing to you understand me I mean if I get up here and singing everybody sit down on me [Applause] what are we trying to do because he's revealed to himself in me and I know it takes more than just religions Hallelujah [Music] [Music] but everybody that took the warning when the storm came they were gone they got out of Harm's Way is it is the flood coming yeah not just in uh flood not just in America all over the world God's getting ready to shake all Christians Jews to prepare a movie and if you don't know the Judgment of the Lord you lose your house foreign and uh nine through twelve or nothing and then I'm gonna go ahead on with this you know why I'm preaching this folks some people because you see because when Peter got thrown in jail Church went into prayer and that's the way it's supposed to be yeah when someone in our church is Afflicted with anything did you know what brother random says if a church pray for somebody we need to search the campaign sin is in the camp did y'all know he said that there is no reason there's no reason why why when we pray because God hears us before we pray God we can't win this win the sea Hallelujah Aiken gotta go I can't do a salt to you he has to repent or get up and get out you don't understand me you don't what will it be at the Judgment if you living a wicked life somebody don't get Victory because of your life foreign Hallelujah you think God don't know he does know I'm not talking about people who are trying to overcome Hypocrites you come here living one way and then go out the door and live in another way may God help us end he he's his name is Stanley Barnes is Stanley Barnes and we've been friends ever since fourth grade and he says something to me hey magic echo shoes and I said you offended me you know what he did he stopped laughing he said I can't offend you yeah and I started laughing because what he said was true and what it was I was trying to act like I was offended we disagree with them but there's not really an offense Hallelujah Your Love covers all of that but he that hateth his brother and walketh because that Darkness have blinded his eyes this is why you can't you can't allowed even anger do y'all think you're going to have anger in heaven the kind of anger we experience comes from the Fallen nature when Jesus was being crucified he never got angry even when he ran the the the the the people out of the temple with the whip you understand me he called it righteous eat the nation in other words he didn't have I'm gonna get you back I'm gonna kill you that wasn't in his mind it was chastisements oh y'all better pay attention I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his namesake of course this or not so he said yeah Adam forgave you Joseph how many of y'all think y'all worthy to be forgiveness on October accounts he said and that and because that God is God and give a fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself let me tell you like this there are some of you who cannot help yes but to come late on Sundays but for those of you who willfully come late you lack respect you respect your job more than you respect God hello you lack respect your revelation of God is incorrect some we can't help it I don't like the way the song leadership um you're wrong and God put the song leader here just for you hey I mean to get to you so you can repent of your pride who who fell apart that's what it is the old Pentecostal Church didn't care nothing about how you how is Hollywood we gotta sound Perfect Pitch Perfect are you insane it's when God said see make a job for noise don't defendant and we've got so prideful we want everybody to know we got the best song leader foreign and I got good ears and I'm telling you it was rough but you know what I did a song with him I enjoyed myself and one of the funniest things he said to me you might imagine I don't know why the people come so late they always wait until the song service is over if you're interested I thought about this church God was telling me and telling on you Germany give God the praise listen Equity I don't come to church be pumped up I come with mine already ready you understand me when I'm screaming in Holland back there I'm not trying to get your attention worshiping my Lord this is not even in my notes and I don't remember but I want you to understand I don't care and you shouldn't care people say I don't have a good voice God gave you that Voice Hallelujah I don't care if you sound like a broken wagon give God the praise which would you rather have which would you rather have no voice a voice that makes noise give me a voice ain't nobody listening to you anyway I'm talking about Turing coming into the uh perfect the will of God laughs yeah let me read this over let me hurry up I know I'm going along there's everybody else you see and that and because that God is God he deserve a respect that's right and he we've got to respect him and give a fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself did y'all hear that not just for him but for all God demand respect for his servants people see his servants how we know that they are his servants because he vindicates these servants by his words let me tell y'all something my brother is not even a Christian and the other day you remember I told you my brother had stage four cancer and this cancer literally went into his bones you text me the other day he is completely cancer-free y'all hear what I'm saying you know why he believed in prayer even though he's another Christian he called me my father prays for him my sister-in-law pray for him y'all hear what I'm saying but he never gave up no matter what the doctors told him y'all hear what I'm saying amen hallelujah a brother a brother from White Horse Hallelujah when God tells a man to do something it is just good as done he said is we pray my wife and I my father and then my wife read a quote in my family the brother brother random that book uh praying thoughts or something like that he healing thoughts healing prayers yeah um and we read that to him he texted me just yesterday and he says everything has stopped he said I'm eating it is he said that that uh uh uh uh all the blood everything has stopped I'm eating and the doctors say they can't find nothing wrong but if there is no respect you gotta have respect for the Servants of God if you lay hands on The Sins Not Just foreign those of us who need Deliverance you don't give up now God I keep falling to the same old thing continuing but if you believe God heard your prayers put a steak down a stake a staff or Metro I asked to be delivered stick down God said he would deliver me let me hurry up I'm sorry all right we've got to respect him and give a feel to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself God demands respect for his servants he his servants how we know that they are here he takes these servants he points himself make them Servants of God Hallelujah did not Jesus say in so much as you've done it until the least of these I know I'm wearing you out a little bit but I need you to listen was hanged at your neck yes and you would drown in the depths of the sea everyone was on phone sitting on it then I'm saying this to husbands I'm saying this to wives I'm saying this to Children yes I was on phone you gotta respect one another because she's your wife God will deal with you because he's your husbands you can't even mistreat your children remember especially when you've dedicated them it's a specific moment when you have dedicated your children to the Lord they are no longer yours I'm closing so it fell there's a lot more to say but I'm closing yeah remember I told you I was whipping my son one day and uh he started calling on the name of Jesus I sounded like a devil stop calling on the name foreign right and some of them kids listening [Laughter] it works but I see it like this if that name stopped me what about the Unseen I lost I'm trying to my heart you have no idea I think about the church all the time yes please there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about this church Iowa City I even can remember that you know when it seemed like we were even that church was a one Accord with us this church but I see now the enemy has wedged a little Gap in between and that's nonsense yes very childish but I'll say this by the grace of God the only way to correct yourself is to get on your knees and pray say the moment this can't be practice so as I'm prepared to practice change comes only by the Holy Ghost he's the only one that could change your heart change your mind and change your ways Hallelujah how many times you've heard a lot of preaching for metaphors heard about everything the word being open and yeah go ahead there you go to convince you that brother Branham is the prophet of the year it's you because Israel understood Moses to be a prophet Israel company they ate Manna From Heaven they draw great water from the rock the zombies God fed him quail and you know what they never crossed over you know why because they were murmurous and complaints and as long as you murmur can't complain possible I'm just telling you James put it this way James had me if you can't control this she won't put me back he said your religion is in vain said the same thing everything comes out of his mouth will either glorify God's glorified you love the Lord remember will you send you oh we got to mature we got to get all things give thanks don't you choose don't need um stand please I remember the time I was outside uh I think I was doing some yard work but anyway I I I wasn't watching where I was going and I stumped my toes did that hurt but I in stumping my toe you know I went down just far enough to miss the tree live if I had not stopped my throat I would I would have really put a real a knot on my head and you know what I thank God for it John now she dribble sir [Music] I thank God for everything that's that has taken place in my life the good job and yes there were times that yeah yeah my life was over overflowed with with pain and hurt and songs [Music] in about three months years ago three months I lost three sisters and they were all my favorite okay they loved me they respected my belief they love my wife they treated me really good and I had no idea and I was about to lose my mind I thought because I I I would get in my car I would drive and cry hysterically because as a Christian I didn't understand how God took those people away from meant so much majority of my family rejected me my Village I'm the only one in the message in my family so the only family I have is you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it because I was led to preach it he says sometimes it's those kind of lessons that makes us remember our first results [Music] but you came up anyway man was that coming yeah I really appreciate everybody that showed up and those who could not because we appreciate you as well [Music] [Music] think about it this little church in Iowa we could please God so much you will have Angel visitations that's what I look at that's what I look for but I can't do it on my own man that's why I go out and say what I say judgment begins at the house of God I can preach positive things I do but I'm concerned about this more than anything else because I know if the Heart Is Right the spirit in this church will change but you know when I come to church [Music] [Music] when I'm in my office I don't have a battle concentration but when I come in here you see like I say get you a cup of coffee whatever it takes to get you into a a a uh awaken you he deserves it the Lord Jesus deserves your prayers may your praise excuse me he deserve your reverence don't don't come to church in Short change him you understand me most of us don't come to church but once a week [Music] I'm still can't comprehend how you do it [Music] and I just say it by God's grace if you just gonna come once everything you got into it [Music] [Music] you should have anointing in this place that would knock me off my feet knock me off my feet really if you come to church thinking that it was boring you need the Holy Ghost you need a stirring up or something wrong in your spirit when the word is being preached screaming even though I do it sometimes that's not it and his words were never raised like John the Baptist but his word had life in my in closing okay what has all the emotional Services done for you kisses if you've been in a service and you jumping and dancing I would love to see that here yeah after it's all done because we come here for change we can't pretend that everything is all right when we can see this [Music] can we just give a moment of time for prayer and I want everybody to pray let us
