[35:52] [Music]
[35:55] he brother
[35:58] we've known for
[36:00] years as I stated
[36:04] last he and I had lost contact with each
[36:09] other when we saw each other
[36:13] earlier we were young
[36:18] [Music]
[36:19] men uh so uh and think about
[36:24] this Liz Paul had uh
[36:27] a night of
[36:29] worship in Atlanta
[36:32] Atlanta and had not that
[36:38] happened we would have never
[36:42] reconnected so that was
[36:46] amazing those things
[36:49] like and I was struggling about
[36:53] going I'm so glad I
[36:55] did and I trust that our brother would
[36:58] have his Liberty this
[37:02] morning we're not going to let time
[37:04] hinder
[37:06] us so we want
[37:08] God have his
[37:10] way amen I told him morning anytime he
[37:15] get something from
[37:16] [Music]
[37:18] God preach it here my door is wide
[37:24] open and if you don't call me then I'm
[37:26] going to call
[37:31] [Applause]
[37:37] him let's say Lord Lord bless brother
[37:55] go
[38:08] wonderful to be in the
[38:12] midst of
[38:15] people that love the
[38:18] Lord I was standing
[38:21] there and I can feel the your praises
[38:28] going up into
[38:30] heaven last night I shared with
[38:34] you that we started in
[38:39] heaven heaven is not a strange place to
[38:44] us we even read the
[38:48] scripture said that when God came
[38:53] forth we came forth with him am
[38:57] Hallelujah
[39:00] Hallelujah Jesus
[39:02] said no
[39:05] man ascended up into
[39:10] heaven except he that came down from
[39:15] heaven so even though you're on the
[39:18] earth you have an Heavenly
[39:21] [Applause]
[39:25] connection amen amen amen I to was uh
[39:31] struggling to go to the the meetings
[39:41] ingia
[39:44] but somehow I made it through get past
[39:49] my own personal
[39:51] [Music]
[39:53] feelings
[39:55] andent
[39:57] I thought it would have been a
[40:02] service but it turned out to be a
[40:08] concert I'm saying Lord what am I doing
[40:12] here and then when I saw brother
[40:16] Brooks I said no I
[40:19] know the reason for me being
[40:23] here but even though we were young men
[40:29] there was a burning in our
[40:32] heart for all that the prophets have
[40:36] said to come to
[40:39] pass
[40:41] so I have
[40:45] decided and I know brother Brooks have
[40:47] made the same
[40:52] decision that we should sweep
[40:55] it
[40:56] to the
[40:59] resurrection and we today we are here
[41:04] now our hair is
[41:10] gray our voice remain the
[41:14] same because the voice do not grow
[41:17] old it's just the outside
[41:23] shelf but God hadn't
[41:27] for me to recognize
[41:30] him minute I saw
[41:34] him because out
[41:36] of all the ministering
[41:41] Brothers is the only one that I
[41:45] felt a kindred
[41:51] spirit and a and a
[41:54] connection that I know is of
[41:59] God but God kept us separate from each
[42:05] other but until the appointed
[42:11] time you'll had to be
[42:14] here to raise your voices to
[42:20] heaven to make all that the prophet
[42:25] said
[42:29] come to
[42:30] [Music]
[42:32] pass
[42:36] [Music]
[42:39] amen there's some there's some things
[42:43] that I
[42:46] may Rec uh
[42:55] recapt for those of you that were not
[42:57] here last
[42:59] [Music]

[43:11] grace

[51:32] me to press the
[51:37] battle
[51:40] amen oh
[51:45] Hallelujah you sang a song
[51:51] earlier
[51:54] that about
[51:57] the
[52:00] Rapture saying that you were prophesying
[52:02] and
[52:04] [Music]
[52:06] something because the Rapture is very
[52:14] real the scripture that I have
[52:18] read speaks
[52:20] about putting on
[52:24] immortality
[52:27] but before we can put all
[52:31] immortality we have to be conscious of
[52:37] immortality but
[52:39] God had to send
[52:43] us the manifestation of the
[52:48] word amen he's not just a
[52:52] prophet Prophet he's much more than a
[52:55] prophet
[52:57] This Is
[52:59] He To Whom It is
[53:02] written I set my angel before your
[53:06] face to prepare your
[53:09] way for
[53:11] [Music]
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:22] immortality last night I was saying that
[53:27] when we came
[53:30] here born of a
[53:32] woman
[53:34] F we were placed in the systems of the
[53:43] world we had to go to
[53:48] school if not
[53:52] no the legal system within investigate
[53:55] while we are not in
[53:59] school these are all the
[54:02] systems that God did not set
[54:06] up but we were subjected
[54:10] [Music]
[54:11] to
[54:14] nevertheless God
[54:17] realized what we were subjected
[54:21] to so he had a
[54:24] s
[54:28] Elijah to prepare
[54:32] us to meet him in
[54:43] there it's just
[54:47] that
[54:51] Mal I don't call him a prophet because
[54:53] he's much more than a prophet
[54:59] those who see him as a
[55:01] prophet they he is a prophet to
[55:05] them he is a prophet to
[55:08] them but I see
[55:11] him as a
[55:15] manifestation of the word of
[55:19] God Amen because for him to be a
[55:23] manifestation of the word of God
[55:28] to say to you and
[55:31] I it is
[55:33] possible to become the
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:41] word oh
[55:44] Hallelujah but before that can
[55:49] happen we have to be
[55:52] conditioned away from the systems of the
[55:58] world God
[56:01] understood that we need to have a
[56:05] renewing of our
[56:10] minds because the systems of this
[56:14] world have conditioned our
[56:18] minds to think a particular
[56:22] way and not the way of God
[56:28] so
[56:33] malach took the
[56:36] word and and and
[56:40] and and
[56:42] planted in the field of the World Around
[56:45] the
[56:50] World this
[56:52] message have gone around the world
[56:56] to every country that there
[56:59] is so they would
[57:02] know that Jesus Christ is
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:10] Lord but you
[57:14] see like Peter
[57:18] said we are a pecular
[57:23] people amen
[57:25] amen oh
[57:31] Hallelujah here we
[57:35] go
[57:40] now when when Malachi
[57:44] 4 begin to spread the seeds of the word
[57:47] of
[57:50] God around the
[57:53] world
[57:56] there were good
[57:58] seeds it was it was the word of
[58:01] God planted in the hearts of the
[58:06] people am but it was only a
[58:12] planting it was not a
[58:18] harvest and after he have
[58:23] planted the enemy
[58:25] came and planted
[58:28] also he planted
[58:32] tears but you have to
[58:35] understand what is a
[58:41] tear
[58:43] amen Jesus said he could only
[58:47] tell then by the
[58:52] fruits so we look at the fruit
[58:56] to see what it
[58:59] produced then we know what was
[59:05] [Music]
[59:08] planted
[59:10] after Mal Malachi 4 was called home and
[59:15] going back into
[59:20] Glory there was another
[59:23] planting
[59:29] and we know it was the planting of the S
[59:32] by the serpent
[59:36] SE the
[59:39] Bible the Bible is not out of season or
[59:44] it's the word of God is still in effect
[59:48] to this
[59:53] day amen you look at the first
[59:59] time the seed that was planted other
[1:00:02] than the word of
[1:00:05] God was planted by the serpent
[1:00:10] himself amen and how did he plant the
[1:00:14] seed with a
[1:00:17] quote Yeah the Lord has
[1:00:20] said amen
[1:00:23] today they said the
[1:00:27] prophecy 58 years
[1:00:32] later there is
[1:00:34] nothing we just
[1:00:37] became
[1:00:40] Experts of what he
[1:00:43] said amen we could not it did not
[1:00:46] produce anything beyond
[1:00:49] that it made us
[1:00:53] intellectual wanted a spiritual
[1:00:59] being
[1:01:02] God
[1:01:04] said let us make
[1:01:08] man in our own
[1:01:13] image it was the only
[1:01:16] time that God
[1:01:21] turn to say let us
[1:01:26] let's come into an
[1:01:30] agreement in
[1:01:32] order to make a spirit
[1:01:37] man amen
[1:01:47] hallelujah and the reason
[1:01:50] why that we have to plant the word of
[1:01:53] God
[1:01:58] because the word of
[1:01:59] God has transforming
[1:02:04] [Applause]
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:08] power it was the word of
[1:02:11] God that
[1:02:14] transform the universe that was
[1:02:23] void
[1:02:26] amen it was transforming
[1:02:30] power they said let there be
[1:02:35] light and transform
[1:02:38] Darkness into
[1:02:44] light it was not a
[1:02:48] quote and God
[1:02:51] decided that he would predestinate
[1:02:57] us not to
[1:03:00] quote we are
[1:03:03] predestinated to the
[1:03:05] word with transforming
[1:03:11] power amen oh Hallelujah
[1:03:16] hallu you
[1:03:21] see but Adam lost
[1:03:29] is been restored to
[1:03:34] us we are connected to
[1:03:40] Adam even though that we are the Seventh
[1:03:48] Generation we still connected to
[1:03:53] him so
[1:03:56] we so God had to show show
[1:04:01] us that the
[1:04:05] reason for the
[1:04:12] message the message
[1:04:16] came for
[1:04:18] us to put on
[1:04:23] immortality before we can put on
[1:04:30] immortality our
[1:04:32] hearts had to be
[1:04:35] turned to our
[1:04:40] fathers we have to have the right
[1:04:45] heart and our
[1:04:48] fathers had the right
[1:04:52] heart so in order for
[1:04:56] us to
[1:05:00] have the proper
[1:05:04] effect for the word to have
[1:05:09] effect we don't want to have the word of
[1:05:12] no

[1:16:25] some of the spirits of of of
[1:16:31] men bearing in
[1:16:34] mind that Enoch
[1:16:38] Soul was wrapped in the instructions of
[1:16:44] God and caus Enoch to walk with
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:53] amen and walking is Walking with
[1:16:59] God is predicated
[1:17:03] upon your soul being wrapped with the
[1:17:06] instructions of
[1:17:14] God last last night I explained to
[1:17:18] you that your
[1:17:22] soul
[1:17:23] is the mystery of

[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:46] mystery even
[1:17:49] Jesus had to be
[1:17:52] predestinated
[1:17:55] amen because he was the first born of
[1:17:58] many
[1:18:01] Brethren he had to be an example to
[1:18:06] us
[1:18:08] amen and even though he was born of a
[1:18:14] virgin he still had to subject
[1:18:20] himself to the ministry of John

[1:18:31] me when I need to be baptized of

[1:18:41] done it becometh
[1:18:44] us to fulfill all

[1:19:11] word he was baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:14] as he was walking out of the River
[1:19:21] Jordan is in that

[1:19:35] flesh when pass his
[1:19:38] Spirit into his
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:44] soul and with the quickening spirit of
[1:19:47] the
[1:19:51] Soul the soul cannot remain in the
[1:19:59] subconscious because the the life of the
[1:20:04] spirit have not enter into the
[1:20:07] soul and cause the soul to
[1:20:13] move from the
[1:20:16] subconscious to the consciousness of the
[1:20:21] Mind amen amen that was the mind of
[1:20:29] Christ amen am he knows what to
[1:20:34] do with the word that's in

[1:21:44] earth and say you can have
[1:21:48] that all of

[2:05:19] the message that was given to
[2:05:24] him
[2:05:26] and you have to
[2:05:30] understand the
[2:05:32] message that's given to
[2:05:35] you it takes the last
[2:05:38] Trump the Trump of
[2:05:41] God the prophet is
[2:05:44] gone between the last Trump and and and
[2:05:55] Mal the serpent seed
[2:05:59] came and S
[2:06:04] tears we just thought the tears was just
[2:06:06] a word in the in the Bible
[2:06:10] I we we thought the tears was a word in
[2:06:14] the
[2:06:17] Bible failing to
[2:06:23] realize that the
[2:06:28] tears
[2:06:31] is
[2:06:34] quotes to try to to convince
[2:06:41] you that is something wrong with you
[2:06:43] because you don't believe all that the
[2:06:46] prophet
[2:06:47] say
[2:06:50] but you need to
[2:06:53] understand who you are in
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:00] Christ the Ser SE could not do
[2:07:04] that it takes an individual in
[2:07:09] Christ to show you how to be in
[2:07:14] Christ how the mind of
[2:07:17] Christ possible in
[2:07:20] you it takes
[2:07:24] someone to step forward and
[2:07:27] say you are a mystery of
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:36] God it's not about learning all the
[2:07:40] quotes and they even claim to be
[2:07:42] floating on the
[2:07:47] quotes we want to be anchored in
[2:07:56] Christ
[2:08:00] Hallelujah Jesus said the two SE will be
[2:08:03] so
[2:08:07] close if it were not for
[2:08:16] predestination they would have deceived
[2:08:18] you
[2:08:21] God predestination of
[2:08:23] you prevented
[2:08:26] you from being
[2:08:30] dece oh
[2:08:33] Hallelujah it is the grace of
[2:08:40] God oh
[2:08:47] my
[2:08:53] Now
[2:08:55] understand that this
[2:08:58] corruption because it came through the
[2:09:01] desires of the
[2:09:06] flesh it became
[2:09:11] corrupted we were supposed to come by
[2:09:13] the spoken
[2:09:16] word amen and God
[2:09:21] sent a
[2:09:23] prophet to speak the
[2:09:26] word like he
[2:09:29] said
[2:09:31] Isaiah to speak the
[2:09:34] word for the manifestation of Jesus
[2:09:42] Christ oh hallelujah
[2:09:47] amen and once we we
[2:09:55] understood
[2:09:56] because Malachi
[2:09:59] 4 brought it to our
[2:10:04] attention that there has to be another
[2:10:10] Ephesians but we have to understand what
[2:10:12] is an
[2:10:15] Ephesian and
[2:10:17] Ephesians
[2:10:18] is the predestination of
[2:10:22] God made
[2:10:26] manifest Paul Paul didn't know he was
[2:10:32] predestinated he didn't even know God he
[2:10:34] thought he
[2:10:38] did until God introduced himself to
[2:10:45] Paul and Paul was shocked
[2:10:50] that God knew
[2:10:51] him and call him by his
[2:10:58] name he blew his
[2:11:01] mind
[2:11:03] understand God you know
[2:11:09] me who are thou
[2:11:13] Lord it is I
[2:11:16] Jesus amen
[2:11:21] he had to go down to Arabia for about 5
[2:11:26] years or so is that
[2:11:30] right to to try to
[2:11:35] understand what he learned on
[2:11:44] gel and his experience on that day
[2:11:53] it took him 5
[2:11:56] years to have the
[2:11:59] understanding when he got the
[2:12:02] understanding he said I didn't go up to
[2:12:04] J to to
[2:12:06] Jerusalem to those that were Apostles
[2:12:09] before
[2:12:12] me I didn't
[2:12:16] seek their approval
[2:12:20] amen he was so
[2:12:23] sure where he
[2:12:25] stood he say if an angel come down from
[2:12:29] heaven and say anything
[2:12:32] different I say let that
[2:12:38] angel he was that
[2:12:40] sure he don't need the approval of
[2:12:44] men approval from
[2:12:47] heaven
[2:12:49] I speak to you
[2:12:50] Gentiles in so much as I
[2:12:53] am the Apostle of the
[2:12:57] Gentiles I magnify my
[2:13:02] office oh
[2:13:04] Hallelujah he's that
[2:13:06] sure that's why I wanted you to speak
[2:13:09] the
[2:13:10] words with
[2:13:13] confidence be
[2:13:15] sure of your Christianity
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:23] hallelujah oh
[2:13:26] my
[2:13:28] now
[2:13:30] this Mortal has to put what
[2:13:37] immortal but they can't put on
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:44] immortality as long
[2:13:46] as the corruption is
[2:13:55] Al
[2:13:57] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:14:04] my my amen
[2:14:16] thank
[2:14:18] oh
[2:14:24] hallelujah
[2:14:25] amen oh
[2:14:27] yeah Colossians 3 amen
[2:14:46] Colossians
[2:14:57] I just want to just want to share
[2:14:59] something with you
[2:15:02] and
[2:15:07] and and release your little
[2:15:11] amen so that you
[2:15:13] get go on I know it's already 12:00 in
[2:15:20] and
[2:15:22] you and you probably start thinking that
[2:15:24] you need something to
[2:15:46] eat
[2:15:51] I think
[2:15:54] so oh
[2:15:57] yes thank
[2:16:07] you go to
[2:16:12] 33 for you are
[2:16:16] dead
[2:16:18] and your
[2:16:20] life is with
[2:16:24] Christ in
[2:16:26] God but you you have to
[2:16:30] die Paul say I Die
[2:16:35] daily that Christ may
[2:16:39] live it is not I that live
[2:16:42] it it is Christ that liveth in
[2:16:46] me
[2:16:49] Hallelujah as
[2:16:53] long that's why sanctification is such a
[2:17:03] prerequisite to the baptism of the Holy
[2:17:08] Ghost sanctification
[2:17:12] allow to go P your
[2:17:16] flesh and pass your
[2:17:19] spirit to go directly into your
[2:17:24] soul when you bring your human
[2:17:28] spirit in subjection to God's
[2:17:34] word is not your it's not your opinion
[2:17:37] but I feel this no you're not dead
[2:17:41] yet but I think you're not dead
[2:17:45] yet am you don't know how I feel you're
[2:17:48] not dead
[2:17:52] yet Jesus
[2:17:56] struggled he even spoke to the
[2:18:00] Tempest and show his
[2:18:03] power he healed the blinded
[2:18:08] ey make the dumb
[2:18:11] speak the cries
[2:18:16] walk but In The Garden of
[2:18:21] Gethsemane he said let this cup pass
[2:18:23] from
[2:18:27] me but in his second
[2:18:32] consideration he decide to
[2:18:37] surrender not my
[2:18:39] will but thy will be
[2:18:41] [Applause]
[2:18:44] done he was
[2:18:46] showing even in his lowest
[2:18:50] point in his own
[2:18:55] Humanity he could
[2:18:59] surrender
[2:19:00] hallu to the word of
[2:19:03] God you do the
[2:19:09] same there is
[2:19:12] power in
[2:19:16] surrender
[2:19:26] Your
[2:19:28] Surrender helps you to put on
[2:19:35] immortality
[2:19:39] immortality is
[2:19:43] Dominion because when you
[2:19:46] said when you were in in
[2:19:52] immortality you you said let you be
[2:19:58] light and the light is still present to
[2:20:00] this
[2:20:02] day and how many how long ago you that
[2:20:06] was
[2:20:08] spoken but because it was
[2:20:13] spoken by
[2:20:16] immortality
[2:20:18] in
[2:20:20] immortality it remains
[2:20:24] Immortal
[2:20:31] imortal God said to
[2:20:34] Adam the day that you
[2:20:37] eat is the day that you
[2:20:42] die Adam
[2:20:44] lived 930 years
[2:20:49] after eating of the the fruit
[2:20:55] of so God wasn't talking
[2:20:59] about physical
[2:21:02] death amen it was talking was what that
[2:21:07] day that Adam
[2:21:10] ate he lost his
[2:21:16] immortality
[2:21:21] amen he did
[2:21:23] it to
[2:21:27] demonstrate
[2:21:29] that God would make a
[2:21:34] way for Eve
[2:21:37] forever because she was born of his bone
[2:21:40] and flesh of his
[2:21:44] flesh because of his love
[2:21:48] for
[2:21:49] Eve he had to make a
[2:21:52] way for her to be
[2:21:55] restored so he placed his
[2:21:59] seed in
[2:22:02] her so God would not destroy
[2:22:08] her because his seed was now in
[2:22:12] her and if if God destroy
[2:22:16] her God would also destroy his
[2:22:21] seed made it
[2:22:23] possible for her life to
[2:22:39] be Satan get
[2:22:43] cocky proud Satan sat
[2:22:48] get
[2:22:48] cocky get
[2:22:53] proud cuz he know had a
[2:22:57] place to hold man
[2:23:02] hostage in the
[2:23:15] grave when
[2:23:18] John
[2:23:20] sent his disciples to Jesus to ask
[2:23:26] him are you the one that is to come or
[2:23:29] should we look for
[2:23:34] another he said told him take wait here
[2:23:39] a minute
[2:23:41] amen and he healed the sick and he
[2:23:44] raised the
[2:23:46] Dead the dumb speak the death
[2:23:51] here and he preached the gospel to the
[2:23:56] poor but he did to John's
[2:24:02] disciple he made them
[2:24:06] witnesses to
[2:24:08] him so they went back to
[2:24:12] John as
[2:24:14] Witnesses of Jesus Christ
[2:24:18] [Applause]
[2:24:24] when John heard
[2:24:28] it John got a
[2:24:33] confidence that he never had
[2:24:35] before he said oh
[2:24:38] death where is that
[2:24:41] thing where oh grave where is their
[2:24:45] victory
[2:24:47] cuz he
[2:24:49] knew that the resurrection of the
[2:24:52] life was on the

[2:27:19] Heavenly Father we just trust that the
[2:27:23] words that were spoken here
[2:27:26] today really bring about a
[2:27:30] change in the minds of those that hear
[2:27:35] it let them not
[2:27:38] be
[2:27:41] distracted by the things of this
[2:27:45] world let them
[2:27:48] see that the purpose for their
[2:27:52] life is not necessarily success of
[2:27:59] invisible the Rich Young
[2:28:02] Ruler was very successful in this
[2:28:10] world Jesus said what does it profit a
[2:28:14] man to gain the whole world
[2:28:18] and suffer the
[2:28:20] loss of his soul what is the loss of the
[2:28:26] soul the intent of that
[2:28:30] God of God's intentions for that
[2:28:35] life not to be made
[2:28:39] manifest for the soul to be
[2:28:44] void of manifestation
[2:28:52] because of the things that they gather
[2:28:55] in this
[2:29:00] world but let us wash our eyes eyes with
[2:29:07] Isa that and that we may
[2:29:13] see that
[2:29:15] which
[2:29:20] God has ordained for you and
[2:29:23] I let us take hold of our
[2:29:31] inheritance that we may be
[2:29:36] able to stand before
[2:29:39] God
[2:29:43] knowing
[2:29:45] like
[2:29:48] Paul
[2:29:49] said I fought a good
[2:29:54] fight I have finished my
[2:29:59] course so
[2:30:02] therefore live in
[2:30:05] heaven is a Crown of
[2:30:11] Life the crown of life is not for Paul
[2:30:15] only
[2:30:18] but for
[2:30:19] us that love his
[2:30:24] appearing and we thank
[2:30:27] God to be to place Us in this
