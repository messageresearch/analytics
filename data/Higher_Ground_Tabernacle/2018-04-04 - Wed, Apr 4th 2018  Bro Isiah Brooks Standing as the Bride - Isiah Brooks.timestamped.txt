[7:35] strengthened with the might with his

[7:40] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[7:43] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[7:46] in love may be able to comprehend with
[7:49] All Saints what is the breadth and
[7:51] length and death and height and to know
[7:55] the love of God of Christ which passes
[7:57] knowledge that he might be filled with

[8:16] throughout all ages world without him
[8:19] let us pray father we thank you for your
[8:23] amazing grace we thank you for being so
[8:26] good to us Lord
[8:28] you've been better to us and we've been
[8:29] to ourselves
[8:30] there is no words o God to express our
[8:33] gratitude Lord we just pray tonight that
[8:37] you would come down and minister unto
[8:39] your people we are needy people Lord we
[8:43] really stand in a great need that need
[8:46] is we need more of you Lord we need
[8:49] faith Lord that faith that was once
[8:53] delivered unto the Saints we need that
[8:57] for this exodus Lord that we're about to
[8:59] embrace help us now in Jesus Christ's
[9:03] name we pray amen
[9:05] you may be seated
[9:11] I had been working by God's grace on a
[9:12] few thoughts and as I was having lunch
[9:18] with my brother Richard a thought came
[9:21] to my heart and mind something he said
[9:23] because I didn't know what to really
[9:26] entitle this message but I like to
[9:32] entitle this message standing as the
[9:35] bride I hope and trust that God will
[9:40] give us understanding and what I'm about
[9:43] to say for these thoughts are not my
[9:46] thoughts but they are he is and in this
[9:53] message I hope and trust that God will
[9:55] give us understanding of who we really
[9:59] are
[9:59] that's very important I have heard many
[10:03] times and even myself have preached when
[10:06] the bride comes to recognize who she is
[10:09] well if you haven't recognized who you
[10:12] are as of yet you need some prayer you
[10:17] need to get before God because it's too
[10:19] late to not know who you are and we're
[10:23] getting ready to embrace a translation
[10:26] that God is by faith promised us and we
[10:31] know by God's grace that God never
[10:33] breaks a promise every word of the Lord
[10:36] is yay God always fulfill his promises
[10:40] and God always interprets his word we
[10:45] don't need to interpret it it's already
[10:47] interpreted sometimes we don't
[10:50] understand actually actually where we
[10:52] are but supposedly the word didn't know
[10:55] that he was the word but the prophet of
[10:59] God came came to tell us that Jesus
[11:01] Christ learned of who he was by way of
[11:04] the word that's how you come to know who
[11:07] you are
[11:08] by the Word of God if you don't read the
[11:10] words you'll never know who you are
[11:12] it is important that you read the word
[11:15] it's important in men that you search
[11:17] the Scriptures because the Bible says in
[11:19] them you think you have eternal life
[11:22] when this
[11:23] thought came to me as I said the
[11:25] scriptures were flowing and by God's
[11:27] grace I want to recoat something brother
[11:31] Branham said from the message hear ye
[11:32] him he said I want you to remember this
[11:35] and this is for the weakest Christian
[11:41] that there is in the building or in the
[11:44] world you don't have to have gifts you
[11:49] don't have to wait till some person come
[11:51] by it comes by who pray for the sick
[11:55] I'll I'll go on record because there's a
[11:58] tape recorder taping in here and I say
[12:01] this that the right mental attitude
[12:03] toward any divine promise of God will
[12:06] bring it to pass
[12:08] if you can get the right mental attitude
[12:11] toward that divine promise and the Word
[12:15] of God will defeat the enemy any place
[12:18] anywhere at any time
[12:21] all the greatest power all the great
[12:25] power of God was in Christ he was God
[12:29] bother me God in Christ reconciling the
[12:33] world to himself but when he met Satan
[12:36] he never used any of his power when
[12:39] Satan met him he said now in other words
[12:42] like if you a miracle performer if you
[12:46] are son of God do a miracle here before
[12:49] me and turn these stones into bread but
[12:53] you realize that Jesus was not Satan's
[12:56] puppet it was not by Satan's demands a
[13:00] command that the word will move the word
[13:04] only moves by faith and you and I must
[13:08] understand that when Satan did what he
[13:10] did or tried to do Jesus didn't say boy
[13:15] don't you know who I am he just used the
[13:19] word get behind me Satan see you would
[13:25] not you Jesus would not have known that
[13:28] Satan twisted or covered a close quote
[13:32] cloaked the word is that right he he
[13:35] covered it up
[13:37] but he didn't quote the real scripture
[13:39] and if you don't know the real script
[13:41] and he had not known the real scripture
[13:43] he could have been deceived that's why
[13:46] it's important to know the revelation of
[13:49] the word is that all right
[13:51] now the Bible tells us that we're born
[13:54] about this bone in flesh of his flesh
[13:55] and as I was thinking I thought oh my
[13:58] isn't that wonderful how even in our
[14:01] marriage ceremonies the groomsmen wait
[14:04] for the bride but in our minds somehow
[14:08] we think that God is waiting on us but
[14:12] God can't move the groomer Guzman can't
[14:14] move until the bride presents herself
[14:17] she has already been chosen right all of
[14:22] the bridesmaids have been chosen
[14:25] everything everyone that's going to be
[14:28] partake of the partakers of this wedding
[14:30] are now presenting themselves but the
[14:35] beauty of the whole wedding is not the
[14:37] groomsman mister bride and she comes out
[14:43] and when she comes out the music begins
[14:46] to play everything in the room has
[14:50] changed from whatever worship it is or
[14:54] what's going on and they focus on the
[14:57] bride and how she comes in why because
[15:02] it has been a task I have a long it took
[15:05] her to prepare herself right it has been
[15:09] a task and understand a man that this
[15:13] whole ceremony is not about mr. Brooks
[15:18] is about the woman who's become whose
[15:21] bill who will become his wife and I love
[15:25] it the scripture says his wife hath made
[15:29] herself ready didn't say didn't say
[15:33] bride said wife and in this terminology
[15:38] you you and I know Amen that somewhere
[15:41] somehow there was an invisible union
[15:45] hallelujah between the male and the
[15:47] female hallelujah Amen is that right
[15:51] probably God tells us that when God
[15:55] impregnates us with the word Amen it
[15:58] seals up everything seals up so the
[16:01] devil can get in there
[16:03] God's bride will not bring forth two
[16:05] seeds she can only bring forth one seed
[16:08] and that seed is God is that right
[16:12] the Bible says let us be glad and
[16:15] rejoice and give honour to who him see
[16:21] because without him there would not be a
[16:24] wedding without him there will not be a
[16:26] marriage hallelujah for the marriage of
[16:30] the lamb has come and his wife have made
[16:33] herself ready hallelujah
[16:37] now you and I must understand the Bible
[16:40] calls us written it Kissel's read of all
[16:44] men but it's more powerful than what
[16:47] your ears are hearing let me say it the
[16:50] way the Prophet said it in the unveiling
[16:51] of God he said as it is written or you
[16:57] are written epistles the Bible says now
[17:00] what is an epistle is a written word and
[17:04] you are the written word and you are
[17:08] written in other words you read it like
[17:11] this oh you read it like this it says
[17:16] you are written epistles or you are the
[17:19] word that has been written hallelujah
[17:25] see that's a difference it makes it
[17:27] clearer why because the grass may with
[17:31] us and the flowers fade away but the
[17:35] word of the Lord shall stand and if God
[17:39] has written you hallelujah you're in the
[17:44] book you are the book and you and I must
[17:47] understand nothing can fail you saw a
[17:50] Lord I'm making a lot of mistakes but
[17:53] understand the bride is written it's not
[17:57] that is she shall be written she's
[18:00] already in the book
[18:02] hallelujah and her life is being guarded
[18:06] by the things that have been written of
[18:08] her and when she is quickened because
[18:13] you understand Jesus was born the word
[18:15] but he was quickened hallelujah at the
[18:19] age of 33 the Holy Ghost came down at
[18:22] the age of 30 is that right and so you
[18:25] and I must understand you
[18:30] until then you're just the word you just
[18:34] a dead letter but when the Holy Ghost
[18:36] come you become a living epistle T when
[18:42] that Holy Ghost come it proves that
[18:45] you're in there and you're part of that
[18:48] word that was spoken before the
[18:51] foundation of the world I just did not
[18:56] come to exist I was always and so are
[19:04] you and you will always be as long as
[19:09] God lives
[19:10] you live what is your name
[19:18] the Bible says for this cause I bow my
[19:21] knees into the father of our Lord Jesus
[19:23] Christ I really caught that father of
[19:25] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[19:28] family in heaven and earth is named that
[19:31] it's written what is your name jesus
[19:36] says that I came in my father
[19:39] name so we realize the name of the
[19:44] father is the Lord Jesus Christ the
[19:48] Bible says that the whole family is
[19:52] named the world don't understand you
[19:59] know more that they understand Malachi 4
[20:03] because they don't understand that
[20:05] Malachi 4 was veiled he was just a
[20:09] vessel that bailed God
[20:13] well he blew the world's mine if I could
[20:17] say like that he confused them because
[20:19] they couldn't understand how a man who
[20:24] didn't know this man of that woman he
[20:26] meant all the women over here or
[20:28] whatever they couldn't understand how
[20:31] this man could discern the hearts now
[20:35] the Bible tells us that the word is only
[20:38] they only one that's capable of
[20:39] discerning the heart oh but they didn't
[20:44] understand it I mean they saw a man it
[20:47] confused him and instead of glorifying
[20:49] God
[20:50] they called him Beelzebub that's the
[20:54] truth the Bible said if Jesus said if
[20:57] they did it in the green tree they gonna
[20:59] do it in the dry everybody can't see
[21:03] this
[21:06] it was purposely veiled said God
[21:11] wouldn't do such a thing is that he did
[21:13] it in those day if everybody knew that
[21:16] Noah was the voice of God or Noah was
[21:19] the mercy of God it would have been a
[21:21] packed house more or less ship but they
[21:26] couldn't see God but no was the living
[21:33] word for his name that he regret you
[21:38] according to the riches of his glory to
[21:41] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[21:44] in the inner man his spirit in you
[21:46] strengthens you that Christ may dwell in
[21:49] your heart oh my god I don't have to see
[21:53] him I know he's real hallelujah oh my
[21:58] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[22:01] love may be able to comprehend with All
[22:05] Saints what is the breadth in the length
[22:08] and the death and the height don't you
[22:10] understand Paul is writing a Ephesians
[22:13] because he knows it's not impossible
[22:15] it's impossible it's impossible how you
[22:19] only comprehend what God is when you
[22:24] fully comprehend that he's no longer God
[22:27] you understand me what is Paul trying to
[22:30] tell you this is beyond you your model
[22:36] that part of you is model but that Holy
[22:41] Ghost is immortal hallelujah come on you
[22:47] said well listen even Jesus Christ when
[22:50] he was on earth did not even know when
[22:52] the rapture would take place but yet he
[22:58] was God don't feel rain though you don't
[23:04] know either but when he conquered all
[23:08] things hallelujah everything was put in
[23:11] his hands he knows now maybe even
[23:18] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[23:20] breadth and length and death and height
[23:22] and to know the love of Christ with
[23:23] passes knowledge that he might be filled
[23:26] with excuse me that ye might be filled
[23:29] with all the food don't you understand
[23:37] what God is doing the mystery of this
[23:39] so-called Gentile bride it's beyond
[23:45] comprehension that's why the only thing
[23:48] you can do is have faith and believe it
[23:55] the mental attitude the right mental
[23:57] attitude toward God's Word is a man
[24:00] yes Lord hallelujah you don't have to
[24:04] understand it as a man tell me what
[24:10] scientists you know and this day can
[24:13] turn water into wine hallelujah but just
[24:19] by the movement of Christ amen it turned
[24:25] you understand me this is no logic in
[24:28] that it shows that even those kind of
[24:32] things can be changed every situation
[24:34] can be changed when faith is applied
[24:37] with the right attitude your attitude
[24:41] makes the difference if your god is if
[24:45] you're in your mind God is weak you
[24:48] would always be weak to you but if he's
[24:51] omnipotent you will always be omnipotent
[24:53] to you I love it
[24:56] unanimous understand what the scripture
[24:59] says herein is our love made perfect
[25:03] that we may have boldness in the day of
[25:06] judgment because as he is so are we in
[25:13] this world right your attitude your
[25:18] comprehension your faith will determine
[25:20] how much God you have in you nowadays
[25:25] because he's God he's the Almighty God
[25:29] hallelujah there's nothing here from him
[25:32] you know one thing for certain when you
[25:37] realize that God is in you there is no
[25:40] fear in love hallelujah when you fear
[25:44] you come in short hallelujah
[25:47] you're not made perfect yet it doesn't
[25:49] mean that God is not in you but you have
[25:52] a surrender the whole house yet but
[25:58] perfect love casts out fear
[26:00] once the Holy Ghost coming you he boosts
[26:03] the devil house
[26:04] he keeps fear and everything that comes
[26:06] with fear right on out the door
[26:08] hallelujah because fear hath torment no
[26:13] God ain't come to torment you he came to
[26:15] help give you life he came to give you
[26:18] joy that you may have it more abundantly
[26:22] that's the word oh my god I just love
[26:27] him but the Bible said we love him
[26:29] because what he first loved us hmmm I
[26:34] love this for if a man say I love God
[26:36] and hate of his brother he is a liar but
[26:40] he that loveth not his brother whom he
[26:42] have seen how can he love God whom he
[26:45] had not seen now I love that one could
[26:47] that give that punches everybody
[26:52] everybody hallelujah is that okay
[26:59] you know the Lord
[27:01] urghhh he did too so standing as a bride
[27:06] are you standing you know I'm standing
[27:12] as a bride as I stand on the promises of
[27:15] God hallelujah because I believe I don't
[27:19] care how long it takes
[27:21] perfection is mine and in his eyes I am
[27:26] perfected you are perfected who me
[27:32] justify he do he does he does he
[27:34] glorifies God's not going to glorify
[27:37] anything that's imperfect glorification
[27:40] comes from perfection hallelujah let's
[27:43] put it this way
[27:44] the Masters touch oh come on somebody
[27:51] there's no hiding place but one there is
[27:56] no acceptance of you except this one
[28:00] place there's only one place of
[28:03] acceptance
[28:05] remember Amen in Egypt when they were
[28:08] coming out there was only one place of
[28:10] acceptance and that was under the blood
[28:12] and that blood was the blood of a lamb
[28:15] Wow because that lamb died in your place
[28:20] when you should have died is that right
[28:23] the Bible says to the praise of the
[28:26] glory of His grace glory of His grace
[28:28] that means grace got glory you got to
[28:32] understand Amen that look at how messed
[28:35] up you and I are without God without God
[28:43] without the blood of the Lamb you and I
[28:47] are worthy of nothing but death every
[28:50] day we were we're worthy of death but
[28:53] the blood of Jesus Christ

[30:37] to the riches of His grace he is a
[30:40] glorious grace wherein he have abound
[30:44] toward us in all wisdom and prudence hmm
[30:47] listen God did not have to open your
[30:50] eyes your understanding we could have
[30:54] been as blind and really honest here but
[30:58] it was God's grace that has opened her
[31:01] eyes hallelujah - what having made known
[31:04] us the mystery of his will see God we
[31:10] look at these things God wasn't
[31:12] interested amen enables and
[31:16] imperfection he wanted them to fulfill
[31:19] his will because his will was the thing
[31:23] that were that he was accepting y'all
[31:27] better hear what I'm saying
[31:28] he knew that were sinners but God wanted
[31:33] his will to be done and his will was to
[31:36] sacrifice a bloody lamb not instead what
[31:41] I'm trying to say
[31:42] see you can't get to heaven on your
[31:44] wheel hallelujah it's not him that
[31:48] willeth know he that run it but is God
[31:51] that shows mercy so you must understand
[31:54] God knows you a sinner but he wants you
[31:57] and me to do his will his will you must
[32:05] understand his will is for you to
[32:08] recognize you our failure to begin with
[32:11] you were born a sinner hallelujah and
[32:15] the only way out of this is for you to
[32:18] apply the token you must accept the
[32:21] blood of Jesus Christ has your atonement
[32:25] and your way of escape and if you can do
[32:29] that to recognize that nothing you can
[32:32] do to save you religious people come a
[32:39] dime a dozen still maybe 50 now for
[32:46] dying but it doesn't matter cuz in this
[32:51] last days only a few be a few will amen
[32:54] make a rap show and is those people
[32:58] whose desire is to do the perfect will
[33:01] of God that right cuz the scripture says
[33:04] if you have a will to do God would count
[33:06] it done see if you have an honest will
[33:11] that's why I love the Lord because he
[33:13] can look beyond all of my faults go
[33:16] right into the heart of me and see what
[33:18] my earnest will
[33:21] hallelujah
[33:23] he knows hallelujah I desire to serve
[33:25] him with the perfect heart in spite of
[33:28] all my failures hallelujah he knows you
[33:34] that's what he looks for somebody not so
[33:39] weak he knows you weak
[33:40] mallalieu yuh that's why he says when
[33:43] I'm your weak he strong they had made a
[33:47] real real Christian no matter how weak
[33:49] he is he knows there's some strength in
[33:52] Jesus that in the dispensation of the
[33:57] fullness of time let me he says having
[34:01] made known unto us the mystery of his
[34:03] will according to his good pleasure
[34:05] which he had purposed in us he's the one
[34:08] that's getting pleasure right that in
[34:11] the dispensation of the fullness of time
[34:12] he might gather together in one all
[34:14] things in Christ both which are in
[34:17] heaven which are on earth even in him
[34:19] and I love to say he said gather all
[34:22] things that are in church ha ha
[34:26] everything that's in Christ
[34:29] she is not you just be Christ being in
[34:32] you but you must be in Christ there's a
[34:35] union here hallelujah and the only
[34:37] hiding place is Christ who is the life
[34:42] of the blood right look what Ezekiel 111
[34:46] 5 says and the Spirit of the Lord fell
[34:48] upon me and said unto me speak thus said
[34:52] the Lord thus have you said o house of
[34:55] Israel for I know the things that come
[34:58] into your mind every one of them so
[35:03] don't think you can hide from God
[35:04] God knows every thought that comes in
[35:07] our mind that's why we supposed to fight
[35:10] them things that's why we supposed to
[35:12] gird up the Lord of my mind think about
[35:15] it God hears your thinking he knows that
[35:22] thought we imitate he knows the thought
[35:25] we fall - hallelujah
[35:29] hello and the Bible says as a man
[35:33] so is he you've got to change that
[35:37] thinking you've got to let God change
[35:40] your thinking because you don't tell me
[35:44] don't mean God doesn't know
[35:47] louia he knows every wicked thought you
[35:51] think and can't you yes what about said
[35:53] grieve not the Holy Spirit it doesn't
[35:57] mean you don't have the Holy Ghost but
[35:58] sometimes we just let thoughts fly right
[36:00] on through and we just have a party when
[36:01] but God is not pleased you love the Lord
[36:09] I'm enjoying this now I I stand as the
[36:12] bride but I recognize Amen he has made
[36:15] he he said the bride has made herself
[36:17] ready but listen we won't be able to get
[36:19] up being glory about nothing because we
[36:21] realize who made us ready he had to give
[36:25] us a substance to make ourselves ready
[36:27] hallelujah and the Bible said you have
[36:30] not because you ask not like that old
[36:36] colored man said I don't want no trouble
[36:37] at the river ha ha ha oh when I'm ready
[36:40] to cross over I don't want no trouble at
[36:43] the river
[36:47] John 3:16 y'all love that for God so
[36:51] loved the world that He gave His only
[36:53] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[36:54] him should not perish but have
[36:56] everlasting life how many of us really
[36:58] believe that do you really believe in
[37:00] Jesus that's what he said not one word
[37:04] can fall to the ground no I don't care
[37:07] about nobody's theology he said it for
[37:15] God
[37:16] son into the world to condemn the world
[37:18] but that the world through him might be
[37:20] saying she people get it all mixed up
[37:22] salvation and and they get the bride and
[37:25] mixed up they're gonna be linear folks
[37:27] say that is not right and I'm not gonna
[37:30] take this salvation away from them if
[37:36] they come up fullest version so be it at
[37:38] least they come up whatever my like the
[37:45] scripture said we wish we gotta be
[37:47] careful cuz Peter looked at that could
[37:50] mean them I said to the Lord you know I
[37:54] I'm not eating anything and clean up
[37:56] I've not touched it no I don't have
[37:58] nothing to do with the unclean things
[37:59] but look what Jesus said see that's what
[38:01] people on the dead they look at at
[38:03] Kamiya's and they don't understand
[38:05] canoes have been walking with God and
[38:06] praying for a long time he had already
[38:08] been sanctified you say oh I don't know
[38:12] about that listen the Bible tells me
[38:14] that Jesus said a man to Peter called
[38:17] nothing unclean that I have sanctified
[38:24] hallelujah and of God and could say to
[38:26] find him how you gonna call him unclean
[38:30] cannot do it mmm I'm enjoying this folks
[38:36] but God sent his son of the world to
[38:39] come for God sent not his son into the
[38:43] world to condemn the world but that the
[38:45] world through him might be saved
[38:46] he that believeth on him is not
[38:48] condemned but he that believeth not is
[38:51] condemned already because he hath not
[38:53] believed in the name of the only
[38:56] begotten Son of God and this is a
[38:59] condemnation that light has come into
[39:02] the world and Men loved darkness rather
[39:07] than light because their deeds were evil
[39:12] and everyone that doeth evil hated the
[39:17] light and say dislike it he said hated
[39:20] it that's a continuation of hate
[39:24] neither come to the light lest the deeds
[39:27] should be reproved and that's the
[39:28] problem
[39:29] this there's no problem in the message
[39:31] but one thing about the message it
[39:34] reproved your error we thought if a man
[39:39] had gifts he was safe we thought if they
[39:42] jump if they shout if they spoke in
[39:45] tongues if they could quote the
[39:46] scriptures they were saying hallelujah
[39:50] but they didn't like our prophet the
[39:53] reason why I didn't like him because he
[39:55] was different than any other preacher
[39:57] what they didn't understand that behind
[40:00] him in the veil of this prophet was God
[40:03] himself
[40:05] hallelujah and God came to bring us
[40:09] light hallelujah and those who obey the
[40:12] light was just no longer read me pistols
[40:16] but they became the Living Word for
[40:18] their day hallelujah that's what God
[40:22] want he wont the Living Word
[40:26] manifestations of the word has been
[40:28] preached is what God is looking for and
[40:31] if that manifestation doesn't come on
[40:33] the sea it will declare that you are not
[40:37] because the anointing of God has come to
[40:40] anoint the word for this power to bring
[40:43] into a manifestation does that make
[40:48] clear but he that doeth truth cometh to
[40:53] the light that his deeds may be made
[40:55] manifest that they are wrought in God
[41:02] you know when you when you say something
[41:04] is raw in God that's working it like
[41:07] [Laughter]
[41:09] rock gold that's beating go oh there's a
[41:13] work with it amen God doesn't work with
[41:16] that individual God works it a man is
[41:22] it's okay the unveiling of God he said
[41:26] listen
[41:27] first Timothy 3:16 say without
[41:29] controversy great is the mystery of
[41:31] godliness for God Elohim capital G OD in
[41:36] the Bible refers it back everybody it
[41:39] refers to the original it says L ahem in
[41:42] the beginning L
[41:43] him and Ella him without controversy is
[41:46] the mystery without controversy great is
[41:49] the mystery of Ella him oh yeah oh do
[41:55] you get it great is the mystery of ever
[41:57] him godly to do something he was a
[42:04] mystery to his angels hallelujah and all
[42:08] the prophets that came forth never
[42:11] understood who L he was they knew he was
[42:15] God but we are seeing something I'm
[42:18] folded in how they that no one else have
[42:21] seen hallelujah Israel whatever you look
[42:28] at this is her oh he was your hova but
[42:30] Israel name was never Jehovah but those
[42:35] who love the family of God his name
[42:39] after God and whatever his name is is
[42:44] our name whatever he is we are is that
[42:50] right the bow said whatever he is
[42:52] whatever he is we are in this world
[42:56] somebody I'm standing Amen as the Bride
[42:59] of Christ
[43:01] mmm well ahem was made flesh and we
[43:06] handed him Elohim veiled in human flesh
[43:10] the great Jehovah that covered all
[43:12] space-time and everywhere was made man
[43:15] we handled him L on him in the beginning
[43:18] L or him and L ahem was made flesh and
[43:21] dwelt among us what this is his way the
[43:24] part of the drama that's the way he he's
[43:27] to act it out his way of revealing
[43:30] himself to us at some different person
[43:33] we are model and we know that and we
[43:36] only understand as mortals we only know
[43:40] as models we only know as our senses
[43:43] will let us know and the rest of it we
[43:45] have to believe by faith we have to say
[43:47] there is a God whether we see him or not
[43:50] we believe it anyhow whether there is
[43:53] not is or not we believe still
[43:57] believe it because God said so like
[43:59] Abraham could not see the Sun no sign no
[44:02] pregnancy of a Sarah no eat not even a
[44:06] administration administration period of
[44:10] anything but yet God said so I hopes her
[44:15] womb was dead and his life and he'll was
[44:17] gone
[44:18] the stream of his life had dried up her
[44:22] life had dried up within her and yet he
[44:24] staggered not at the promise of God
[44:26] through unbelief but was true
[44:29] giving praise knowing that God was able
[44:32] to perform anything he said he would do
[44:35] what are you saying relevance is likened
[44:37] unto us why do we allow our faults why
[44:40] do we allow our flesh our failures and
[44:43] handicaps of our flesh it meant to
[44:45] dictate to us when God said so y'all
[44:50] understand me if God said there be a
[44:53] bride there will be a bride if God has
[44:55] put it to you through the world under
[44:57] the preaching of the word and you able
[44:59] to class I'm bride you are bride
[45:02] hallelujah why because the word could
[45:05] only be quickened to those Louie
[45:07] he has predestinated it to be a
[45:09] quickened - this ain't no joke it is a
[45:12] real thing this is the reality of
[45:16] Malachi for you and I must understand
[45:22] this is a serious power that we're
[45:24] living in and what we were working with
[45:26] you and I got God don't have any kind of
[45:28] special treatment toward you unless
[45:31] you're walking in his word believing his
[45:34] word you understand me only the seat of
[45:40] God will escape this generation only the
[45:44] seat of God
[45:45] hope this understanding listen Matthew
[45:49] 27:51 54 beheld behold the veil of the
[45:54] temple was rent did you know oh let me
[45:56] hurry up the veil of the temple was rent
[45:58] in twain from the top to the bottom and
[46:00] the earth did quake and the rocks rent
[46:02] and the graves were opened and many
[46:04] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[46:06] and again came out of the graves at this
[46:10] resurrection
[46:10] went into the holy city and appeared
[46:12] unto many now when the Centurion and
[46:15] they that were with him watching Jesus
[46:18] saw the earthquake and those things that
[46:21] were done they feared greatly a saying
[46:24] truly this was the son of God now listen
[46:27] what brother Brown say let me just see
[46:32] you got to understand when that veil was
[46:35] rent those Jews can look through the
[46:37] window like the prophet of God say and
[46:39] he's from that temple they saw Jesus
[46:42] hanging on the cross what was he doing
[46:46] unveiling himself that not some lamb
[46:49] behind the curtain it was being
[46:54] crucified they saw the naked word he
[46:57] unveiled himself and they still did not
[47:00] want to recognize who he was
[47:03] that's why the veil was red so that they
[47:07] could see who the real Lamb of God was
[47:12] that's why the denominational there must
[47:15] be raped robbed because it's not your
[47:18] organization or your you know your
[47:20] denomination that saves you it's still
[47:23] the lamb it's still the blood of Jesus
[47:26] he's the only one that can save you it's
[47:29] not because you group yourself with the
[47:32] message is what you coming cut who you
[47:35] come in contact with you must know him
[47:40] that's what Paul said I don't want to
[47:42] just be a churchgoer I want to know him
[47:44] in the power of his resurrection don't
[47:53] notice the very word that Jesus reported
[47:56] back to them but they come to see who he
[47:58] was he talking about the Greeks they
[48:01] come to see him we would see Jesus he
[48:04] was and they could not see him they see
[48:07] in the form but he was in his temple God
[48:10] was in his temple veiled in human flesh
[48:12] notice the words he said except the corn
[48:16] of wheat falls into the ground seat and
[48:17] dies it dies alone y'all understand what
[48:21] he's saying that he said unless I die
[48:23] I can't produce any more of my kind I
[48:29] was telling somebody the other day today
[48:31] on the phones and when I said don't you
[48:33] know that corner wheat must die you bury
[48:36] one corner wheat and it's going to come
[48:38] up with a stalk you know or whatever and
[48:40] I said if it's corn you're gonna have
[48:43] more than just one corn you gonna have
[48:45] several in corn and with that several
[48:47] ears of corn you will have multiple
[48:48] seeds that one seed produced that you
[48:52] plant those seeds and multiply it
[48:55] multiply it multiply by the same order
[48:59] that God gave him in the first atom the
[49:02] second atom had the same commandment
[49:06] replenish and multiply hallelujah not
[49:11] some human seed but your own seed can I
[49:15] say like that's God
[49:17] see here what couldn't they see Jesus he
[49:23] was mask
[49:24] God was mask the Great the greet one a
[49:27] God and here he was but they couldn't
[49:30] see him
[49:30] because of the veil think that's
[49:33] something and the Bible said he wasn't
[49:35] good to look at he wasn't some tall
[49:38] statute God with big muscles and you
[49:40] know there are shoulders and a little
[49:42] thin ways know the Bible said he wasn't
[49:44] even good to look at but nothing
[49:46] beautiful about Jesus hello it just
[49:50] messed him up well you see God shed a
[49:52] little wet foot I was a 49 and a 5-1
[49:56] when her brother Brandon had high height
[49:58] was a little fella like that who had to
[50:02] look up the Billy Graham God you know
[50:04] what's his name um the Pentecostal
[50:07] brother or robbers and everything have
[50:10] you seen the picture he's the shortest
[50:11] thing on the picture but but people
[50:15] looked at I mean you know meek and
[50:17] humble you know they looking at in that
[50:20] debt that whole character blinded them
[50:25] but you see they couldn't understand how
[50:27] can people say bad things to him and
[50:29] then drop dead and he did that was God
[50:36] these things are on record it's not
[50:38] imagination it's a reality and what
[50:42] makes you believe this when millions of
[50:46] people won't have nothing to do with it
[50:51] wake up you are the Word of God and God
[50:57] wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[50:59] you will be that Living Word right
[51:06] they don't recognize us we're veiled we
[51:12] don't have our DVDs and LCDs and all of
[51:15] this education we're not lusting for all
[51:17] that stuff because we're satisfied I'm
[51:23] so sorry if the world want more out of
[51:26] me they won't get it
[51:30] my heart is fixing my mind is made up
[51:33] yeah all I want is Jesus I don't want
[51:37] nothing else it doesn't matter what work
[51:41] what cost
[51:42] what kind of price I must pay he's long
[51:45] at the end of the day I'm in his arms
[51:49] y'all look at me like you're gonna be in
[51:52] his arms now if those sisters ran up to
[51:55] brother branham and said my precious
[51:56] brother you don't think we're gonna get
[51:58] a chance to hug my Jesus I'm gonna hug
[52:04] my Jesus
[52:06] that's one of my rewards they couldn't
[52:14] see God because God was veiled to him
[52:16] now keep that on your mind
[52:18] God was veiled in a man they couldn't
[52:20] say no man can do these words except it
[52:23] be God that's what they said they could
[52:26] say that no man can do these things
[52:28] except they be God but they did not want
[52:30] to give him his proper position right no
[52:34] man can do it and how here stands a man
[52:37] and yet the worst of God is manifested
[52:39] through him see they couldn't understand
[52:41] God was veiled see that's how it is with
[52:45] us
[52:46] a lot of time that's all you laying
[52:48] hands on as you can
[52:49] recovery you is him be careful all of us
[52:54] must be careful that we don't get the
[52:55] glory for that it's always God is that
[53:03] ride in the olden days he said he was in
[53:06] them that's what he did he was but but
[53:09] now he lives his life through us in the
[53:12] prophecy step in a step out and step in
[53:15] a step out
[53:16] but now he's in US and Jesus said I'll
[53:19] never leave it nor forsake you that
[53:21] means I'm always with you if you want to
[53:24] stay in the Shekinah glory you can stay
[53:27] in the Shekinah glory it's your attitude
[53:33] toward every promise mmm lower to God
[53:38] you love the Lord amen Corinthians 3:16
[53:41] through 17 says no you not ye are the
[53:43] temple of God and that the Spirit of God
[53:46] dwelleth in you If any man defile the
[53:49] temple of God him shall God destroy for
[53:53] the temple of God is holy which temple
[53:54] ye are hallelujah so you gotta be
[53:58] careful if you having problems you gotta
[54:02] ask God for deliverance
[54:05] hallelujah cuz you know if you continue
[54:08] to do wicked things or bad things in the
[54:11] your the setting of your body you know
[54:13] disease and things gonna jump on you
[54:14] something gonna happen you're not going
[54:16] to get away with it free you know you
[54:18] paying a price he didn't say he was
[54:24] going to destroy you he said your temple
[54:32] your position
[54:34] what is your position do you have any
[54:35] idea what your position is you know
[54:38] we're not a part of this Christendom per
[54:42] se
[54:42] we're not part of some organization
[54:47] somewhere you can join this thing hmm
[54:50] you know God Jesus told Nicodemus you
[54:53] must be born again and those are right
[54:56] like I said you may hurt you heard me
[54:59] said many times you were born into this
[55:01] world you know you didn't bring it you
[55:03] didn't come in on a jet plane or some
[55:06] stock brought you you was literally
[55:08] birth into this world and in order for
[55:11] you to get in the world to come you have
[55:13] to be born into it it exists but that's
[55:17] the only way that you can get there
[55:20] psalms 82:6 2:7 says I have said Ye are
[55:25] gods and all you are the children of the
[55:29] Most High
[55:30] wait a minute that's psalms 82:6 through
[55:34] seven says that ye are God's little G
[55:38] I'm not all of him but I'm a part of
[55:41] Elohim I am a part of his attributes his
[55:47] thoughts hallelujah no come on somebody
[55:55] but he said even though you're little
[55:57] God's you should die like men and fall
[56:01] like one of the princess but death gonna
[56:06] get you hallelujah but don't you realize
[56:13] what eternal life is eternal life is
[56:18] just saying you are eternal is that
[56:23] right
[56:23] whereas the Prophet said Jesus God could
[56:26] not die so he had to make a body that
[56:28] could just to show you what he was
[56:31] feeling so that you can get a
[56:33] comprehension our understanding of His
[56:36] divine love for you there's
[56:42] death in God hallelujah but that's what
[56:46] he said if a man believe it on me he
[56:48] said he is passed from death I'm
[56:50] delaying believe what he is God see that
[56:57] that was a problem Amen with Lucifer he
[56:59] got to know got a notion that he was not
[57:02] the only God and Lucifer thought well
[57:05] maybe I could become one he did the god
[57:09] of this evil a hallelujah shade are we
[57:12] gonna tell you a kingdom down it is what
[57:17] it is yes we are tearing his kingdom
[57:20] down that's what's so important for us
[57:24] to witness folks so important so that
[57:28] God could show and display himself that
[57:30] somebody who's in prison might be able
[57:33] to believe and receive eternal life in
[57:36] about you and ain't about me is about
[57:38] him God in morph is that right
[57:41] whew what that mean God changes God
[57:44] changes his mass oh if people could just
[57:47] see it hallelujah you said well what do
[57:50] you mean let's say Adam he was Adam with
[57:52] male and female enemy and nobody knew it
[57:55] until it the veil was the seal was
[57:59] broken want to put it that way right and
[58:02] then how comes he who is a part of him
[58:07] her origin was Adam and Adams origin was
[58:12] God hallelujah
[58:14] oh come on somebody when Jesus Christ
[58:17] the word when God he created that body
[58:23] he put male and female hallelujah we are
[58:28] out of him Jesus and Jesus is out from
[58:31] God if you want to see it's only one
[58:34] guard person but in order for us to
[58:36] understand that he had to break it down
[58:38] like that because we're mortal mind you
[58:41] and I we don't know nothing about he
[58:43] existing without a maker but the maker
[58:48] existed without a maker
[58:53] listen he had always been God hallelujah
[59:00] y'all can hit me in the word if you like
[59:02] it is the word but that's how that they
[59:08] couldn't you can't get this straightened
[59:10] out and have three gods that's what I'm
[59:13] saying he said you would never sell a
[59:15] Jew dad I'll tell you that one who knows
[59:19] better he knows there's only one God I
[59:23] knew that when I was in the Baptist
[59:24] Church I couldn't explain it but I knew
[59:26] it and I knew Jesus Christ was God I
[59:30] didn't understand the Father part but I
[59:33] knew he was God hallelujah that's what
[59:36] God has done to this age it's been here
[59:40] and all these things have been here and
[59:42] it's supposed to be revealed in this age
[59:44] now the Bible says they will be revealed
[59:48] in the latter times it's like a sculptor
[59:51] keeping his piece of work all covered
[59:55] over until the time he takes the mask
[59:57] off of it and there it is that's what
[1:00:00] the Bible has been it has been a work of
[1:00:03] God that's been covered up and it's seen
[1:00:06] it's been here since the foundation of
[1:00:08] the world
[1:00:09] and his 7th all mystery and God
[1:00:12] promising this day that at that age of
[1:00:16] this latest in church he would take the
[1:00:18] mask off the whole thing and we could
[1:00:21] see it
[1:00:21] what a glorious thing being made in the
[1:00:27] likeness of Christ God's own image
[1:00:30] held him poured into you it's not like
[1:00:34] he vomited up no song he gave it to you
[1:00:37] he poured himself he placed himself into
[1:00:40] you got him awful mask in the pillar
[1:00:44] fire guard him awful in a man called
[1:00:48] Jesus goddamn awful in his church God
[1:00:53] above us God with us God in us the
[1:00:58] condescending of God who hallelujah we
[1:01:02] couldn't go there he had to come here
[1:01:04] hallelujah up
[1:01:06] holy no one could touch him he settled
[1:01:09] upon the mountain and even if the
[1:01:11] animals at just the mountain had to die
[1:01:13] and then God come down and changes tent
[1:01:16] come down and live with us become one of
[1:01:19] us and we we held him we the Bible said
[1:01:22] first Timothy 3:16 without controversy
[1:01:25] great is the mystery of godliness for
[1:01:27] God was manifested in the flesh handled
[1:01:31] with hands God eat meat God drink water
[1:01:34] God slept
[1:01:35] God cried he was one of us beautiful
[1:01:38] type in the Bible that's what God above
[1:01:41] were us God with us now is God in us the
[1:01:44] Holy Spirit not the third person the
[1:01:47] same person God came down and become
[1:01:50] flesh and died the death in Christ so
[1:01:52] that he could clean the church in order
[1:01:55] to get into it for fellowship
[1:01:58] God loves fellowship that's what he made
[1:02:01] the man at the first time for was for
[1:02:04] fellowship in that funny and that's
[1:02:06] where the devil try to do break our
[1:02:08] fellowship with God every day and that's
[1:02:10] what Calvary part of it was about a
[1:02:12] mentor is somebody just like the Bible
[1:02:15] tells it then the prophet of God said
[1:02:16] God Satan could never never destroy the
[1:02:19] relationship but he destroyed the
[1:02:21] fellowship he brought a breach amen into
[1:02:24] our fellowship into our union with God
[1:02:26] but thank God for Christ hallelujah he's
[1:02:29] the one that binded up the breach that
[1:02:32] we could have fellowship with him that's
[1:02:35] what he made the man at first time for
[1:02:37] was for worship fellowship God dwells
[1:02:40] alone with cherubims I'm trying to
[1:02:45] finish off see we must be the Living
[1:02:47] Word the Bible says yea yea ye are our
[1:02:51] epistle written in our hearts yay our
[1:02:54] epistles written in our hearts known and
[1:02:56] read of our men see for as much as ye
[1:02:58] are manifestly declared to be the
[1:03:00] Epistle of Christ see the manifestation
[1:03:02] must be there right ministered by US
[1:03:05] written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:03:07] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:03:10] but in fleshy tables of the heart right
[1:03:14] so the manifestation must be it is it
[1:03:17] has that token that is put up
[1:03:20] so you can see it the manifestation of
[1:03:23] the Word of God living today in you and
[1:03:26] me it must be a personal vindication it
[1:03:31] can't be because you you know you know
[1:03:32] you're in a group it must be you must
[1:03:35] have a personal vindication of God that
[1:03:38] you are of an epistle of God in this day
[1:03:42] you said what he said listen think by
[1:03:45] the living presence of the Living Christ
[1:03:47] by the Living Word all living Christ
[1:03:49] living presence Living Word watch by his
[1:03:52] own personal personal vindication proves
[1:03:56] his church not membership he never done
[1:04:01] it in that days of Moses he never done
[1:04:04] it in the days of anybody else at the
[1:04:06] end of the world and when it comes to
[1:04:08] the place where it was the destruction
[1:04:09] the days of lot
[1:04:11] it wasn't membership it was personal
[1:04:13] vindication God in fleshy personal
[1:04:18] vindication remember think of it that
[1:04:21] people born of his spirit in a day like
[1:04:24] this in the great denomination or age
[1:04:27] that we live and the Living God takes
[1:04:30] his living word and vindicates it
[1:04:33] personally this life that's in the word
[1:04:36] the germ that's in the seed and the word
[1:04:39] is a seed thatis or with off the soul
[1:04:42] and the life is Christ in the word
[1:04:45] personally in you vindicating something
[1:04:49] that you cannot do proven yourself that
[1:04:53] is not you but is him and you become a
[1:04:58] love slave to him to be a bride oh
[1:05:02] thanks be to the Living God who created
[1:05:05] the heavens and the earth and all that
[1:05:07] is in the midst no wonder he's an alpha
[1:05:10] and omega he's the beginning in the
[1:05:11] ending he was at first he was which is
[1:05:14] and all and shall come the root and
[1:05:17] offspring of David the bright and
[1:05:18] Morning Star he is all and in all y'all
[1:05:23] understand me hey that's what makes a
[1:05:26] difference that's why we're standing
[1:05:29] because God has got a personal
[1:05:31] vindication
[1:05:33] he put his signature on you hallelujah
[1:05:39] didn't leave you out there he personally
[1:05:42] vindicated this message to you now I'm
[1:05:47] almost done you love the Lord see you
[1:05:51] you and I must understand him God is
[1:05:54] still hiding from all unbelievers I mean
[1:06:00] even if he they unveiled himself they
[1:06:02] gonna believe it he can show it show
[1:06:04] them and say hey he come down say I am
[1:06:06] God ain't gonna believe it
[1:06:09] hmm ain't nothing in him to believe will
[1:06:13] see God here behind the veil Moses was
[1:06:17] very Moses veiled his face Moses was the
[1:06:22] Living Word veiled in the people saw
[1:06:25] that the pillar of fire said now we are
[1:06:27] satisfied she let Moses speak see don't
[1:06:31] let God speak lest we die Moses walked
[1:06:34] right into the pillar of fire see what
[1:06:36] they didn't understand they had rather
[1:06:39] man standing there with them right and
[1:06:43] in fact they fail to see that the same
[1:06:45] man that was standing with them wasn't
[1:06:48] preaching his own words he was preaching
[1:06:50] the same words that God told him he
[1:06:52] could not go - contrary to what the
[1:06:55] pillar fire told him to say Wow because
[1:06:58] what they did not see was that Moses was
[1:07:01] just a veil of the pillar of fire that
[1:07:04] same one that was rub the mountain
[1:07:06] hallelujah was now in a flash male right
[1:07:11] he said oh now I want to speak no more
[1:07:14] like this I give them a prophesy and
[1:07:17] that's the way he has always did it see
[1:07:20] now it's let them go up but this prophet
[1:07:23] has to have this word if you fail with a
[1:07:26] tradition God never sent him if he's
[1:07:29] veiled with the word God were vindicated
[1:07:31] God interpret his own word Moses spoke
[1:07:34] them listen how can a man say I'm gonna
[1:07:37] be over in this foreign country over
[1:07:38] there and Russia somewhere in him the
[1:07:40] little boy that's gonna get killed will
[1:07:41] be wearing a certain kind of cold I mean
[1:07:44] he's gonna be hit and he's gonna be dead
[1:07:45] and all this kind of stuff he said write
[1:07:47] it
[1:07:47] in the Flyleaf or your book cause it's
[1:07:49] gonna happen did it happen matter fact
[1:07:52] when he got there and saw the little boy
[1:07:54] in the streets he didn't even know who
[1:07:56] the boy was until the Holy Ghost quicken
[1:07:57] it like something was familiar but it
[1:08:01] couldn't put his mind listen people you
[1:08:03] gotta understand God was controlling the
[1:08:06] Prophet like God controls us I don't
[1:08:12] understand why people don't just get
[1:08:13] their own glory like that my prophet
[1:08:15] never glorified himself ever that's the
[1:08:22] word in your sealed book he said forget
[1:08:26] all about me did he say it he said it he
[1:08:32] said the wondering are worse things that
[1:08:33] you can do a man is take the tradition
[1:08:36] of it and live by it tradition is
[1:08:41] tradition we're free that's what makes
[1:08:48] denomination and organizations because
[1:08:50] they traditionalized things and then God
[1:08:52] moves on and you standing in your
[1:08:54] traditions is this okay but this prophet
[1:09:04] has to have his word and it is very with
[1:09:06] tradition God never sent him if he's
[1:09:09] veiled with the word God were vindicated
[1:09:11] God interprets his own word Moses spoke
[1:09:14] to him God and interpreted him right
[1:09:17] right
[1:09:19] the Lord said so and the Lord did just
[1:09:21] what he said that makes it right now he
[1:09:25] said now Moses you understand the people
[1:09:29] understand now see I have showed you I
[1:09:32] have indicated you God had veiled
[1:09:35] himself in a prophet so speak to speak
[1:09:37] to his word to his people Moses was the
[1:09:41] Living God to them yeah y'all better
[1:09:46] understand what I'm saying because at
[1:09:49] some point in time oh lord have mercy
[1:09:51] brother Adam said if they would have
[1:09:54] received this message America would not
[1:09:56] have knee not even an army
[1:10:01] why because they had a profit on the
[1:10:04] scene
[1:10:06] he's real we would have never we would
[1:10:09] have never lost about him so how do you
[1:10:21] know what's happening over here when
[1:10:22] they've got a prophet by the name of
[1:10:24] Elijah and he knows everything that
[1:10:26] y'all doing in secret i paraphrased
[1:10:34] things forgive me because maybe I say it
[1:10:37] not just right but the content of what
[1:10:40] I'm saying is right so you must
[1:10:43] understand by God's grace amen had this
[1:10:45] method listen when they put Jesus when
[1:10:48] they put brother branham out of the
[1:10:50] churches remember he said I moved to
[1:10:53] Arizona
[1:10:53] he said they know I'm here and I've been
[1:10:57] here so many years now and not one
[1:10:58] person has invited me to preach in their
[1:11:01] pulpit oh they thought they were putting
[1:11:04] this crazy prophet out oh they didn't
[1:11:06] understand they were fulfilling
[1:11:08] revelations 3 I stand at the door not
[1:11:12] King trying to get into your church
[1:11:17] because you have put me out what was it
[1:11:21] his way was to straight this way is a
[1:11:25] straight and narrow way they can't just
[1:11:30] do what you want to do and expect you go
[1:11:31] to heaven Aspray is narrow it straighter
[1:11:36] than anything you've got on the earth ah
[1:11:38] and it doesn't become a burden when
[1:11:40] you're born again when you got the right
[1:11:44] spirit of living holy it's hard it's
[1:11:47] hard to the man who's trying to do it by
[1:11:49] his own works but ask a sheep is it
[1:11:55] difficult for you to bring forth this
[1:11:58] wool the sheep don't manufacture wool
[1:12:03] it's part of it you understand me and
[1:12:08] when you truly born again the desires of
[1:12:11] the world
[1:12:13] you it doesn't mean you're not gonna
[1:12:16] have a battle in your face because your
[1:12:18] flesh is not converted that's why God
[1:12:21] gonna give you a new one y'all need me
[1:12:32] read that again again you know now Moses
[1:12:37] you understand that people understand
[1:12:39] now see I've showed you I have
[1:12:40] vindicated you God has failed himself in
[1:12:43] this prophet to speak his word to the
[1:12:45] people Moses was a living God to them
[1:12:47] the Living Word of God made manifest
[1:12:49] that's the reason his face is veiled
[1:12:54] hello and when brother Brandon was here
[1:12:58] amen the people saw him as God
[1:13:01] now they got confused because they
[1:13:05] didn't see the God behind brother
[1:13:08] Branham like the people did not see the
[1:13:10] God behind Moses but Moses had the Word
[1:13:14] of God
[1:13:16] hello that's why he could stand there
[1:13:19] when Nathan and Cora had done done all
[1:13:21] that wicked stuff he says who all is on
[1:13:23] the Lord saw he was the only one that
[1:13:26] could bring a separation because all the
[1:13:28] other people have been deceived that the
[1:13:31] God that they had just raised up
[1:13:33] denomination right because remember they
[1:13:37] were one people but when they would
[1:13:38] raise up that golden calf they deified
[1:13:40] their denomination and it took a prophet
[1:13:44] and said that's not God you worship Him
[1:13:47] huh
[1:13:48] he lied you had to do the same thing the
[1:13:51] word Bale means Lord because everyone
[1:13:53] has it Lord lot is that you gonna say
[1:13:56] one of these days you called me Lord
[1:13:57] Lord have not we done you didn't do
[1:13:59] nothing in the scripture Jesus saying
[1:14:02] you can't do nothing outside of me I'm
[1:14:07] almost done let me hurry so you can
[1:14:09] understand by the grace of God we
[1:14:12] understand how people can you know Paul
[1:14:15] said they they took him as God - you
[1:14:17] know Paul had to rebuke Ulysses now
[1:14:20] listen I'm so glad I didn't baptize none
[1:14:23] of you
[1:14:24] I'm baptized none of y'all on my name
[1:14:27] not nothin right right he said but then
[1:14:29] there was some of you who would have
[1:14:31] plucked your own eyes out for me you
[1:14:33] even saw me as being God that's yo
[1:14:37] scripture so the same thing that
[1:14:39] happened to brother our Paul happen to
[1:14:41] brother man and he was basically trying
[1:14:44] to get the people not to do that I'm
[1:14:46] just a veil here mmm not taking away
[1:14:51] from brother Branham I thank God because
[1:14:53] you know what that's what I try to tell
[1:14:55] people I say y'all don't understand self
[1:14:57] estas was in his hands brother Branham
[1:15:00] was one of them so where are your star
[1:15:04] [Laughter]
[1:15:11] he couldn't preach listen I may be corny
[1:15:15] but not verbatim with brother Graham
[1:15:16] said listen
[1:15:16] because he said about giving glorifying
[1:15:20] himself he said I couldn't glorify
[1:15:22] myself because he wouldn't let me you
[1:15:31] know he's saying he'd never try to get
[1:15:34] the glory he would never do that and
[1:15:36] besides that he wouldn't let me
[1:15:40] now the Lu you said what brother bands
[1:15:43] I'm sure I'm so tired I'm so tired I'm
[1:15:45] just gonna drink this I'm just going
[1:15:46] drinking it that that holy sweet oh you
[1:15:54] can't defy yourself where women are why
[1:16:01] Jesus when I used to hear people say
[1:16:03] that night what Jesus now I understand
[1:16:06] it well there we are
[1:16:09] and after you know the same listen God
[1:16:13] failed himself as Moses and it goes on
[1:16:15] and says and and God the Living Word of
[1:16:18] God made manifest that's the reason he
[1:16:20] his face is veiled see and do you know
[1:16:23] the same thing in a genuine Christian is
[1:16:26] veiled today to unbelievers they say see
[1:16:30] them women and with long hand things and
[1:16:32] say look at that old model women twist
[1:16:35] their hair up on the back say God
[1:16:37] flat tire spare tire up there see it's
[1:16:40] all Vail they're blind they say you know
[1:16:44] and that's what people say oh that ain't
[1:16:45] necessary it is Bob Taylor women won't
[1:16:49] make a rapture because you when a woman
[1:16:54] cuts her hair she refusing her headship
[1:16:58] that's the word and I said when you
[1:17:01] woman cuts her hair she might as well be
[1:17:03] bald in the sight of God I didn't say
[1:17:09] she wasn't saying but she won't make a
[1:17:11] rapture straight no such custom in the
[1:17:17] house of God
[1:17:18] that's what Paul says go throughout the
[1:17:21] scripture women we cut our hair you know
[1:17:23] who cut their hair bail worship person
[1:17:25] you say where you get that from jazzy
[1:17:31] kind of sound like Jay Z isn't it jazzy
[1:17:34] Jezebel hallelujah I don't care what you
[1:17:39] got you still ignore you still ignorant
[1:17:42] of the word you hear what he says see
[1:17:45] they're blind
[1:17:47] he said they say I got a PhD in L
[1:17:49] whatever I don't care what you got you
[1:17:51] still ignorant of the word is that good
[1:17:53] right oh that's just something minor
[1:17:55] take this fall lessons first oh yeah I'm
[1:18:03] at the end so you cannot know by God's
[1:18:07] grace it's just a 45 I got a couple
[1:18:08] minutes he said listen we're partakers
[1:18:11] of his glory

[1:21:11] it right I told you it meant that you
[1:21:17] and with me before the foundation of the
[1:21:19] world he told them that you're no
[1:21:22] stranger than me you always being with
[1:21:24] me
[1:21:25] I gave you the authority to cast out
[1:21:30] Devils
[1:21:31] don't you understand this storm is full
[1:21:34] of them cast the devil's out of the
[1:21:36] storm you say it's not true the Bible
[1:21:39] says Satan comes to steal kill and
[1:21:41] destroy
[1:21:42] whenever you see anything being
[1:21:44] destroyed that's of the devil and demons
[1:21:47] are behind it
[1:21:50] listen he said we're in him this is my
[1:21:53] last quote we're in him then we being in
[1:21:59] him we are still veiled to the religious
[1:22:02] and professors of the world see our
[1:22:05] glory that we have and enjoy
[1:22:07] we are still veiled to them outside us
[1:22:09] they think we're crazy a nut again
[1:22:11] that's right but we who are in here in
[1:22:15] Christ baptized into him on the first
[1:22:18] Corinthians 12 into him we are partakers
[1:22:21] of his glory see but not on the outside
[1:22:24] you're still looking in denying it see
[1:22:27] so now we are invited into him to be
[1:22:31] partakers of all that he is
[1:22:35] well we're invited into him which is
[1:22:39] here - the unbeliever by the veil of the
[1:22:42] human flesh see they know that glory
[1:22:45] they read of it it is the word here the
[1:22:48] glory of God and things like that and
[1:22:51] it's just word to them to us it's a
[1:22:55] manifestation see is not law is it is no
[1:22:59] more a word it's a reality huh he said
[1:23:03] God said let there be light that was the
[1:23:06] word but now there is light it ain't the
[1:23:11] word is the light
[1:23:13] whoa yo hit me that's what he's saying
[1:23:17] the bride has been spoken demon into
[1:23:20] existence hallelujah amen and she lost
[1:23:23] bare record of the word that's been
[1:23:26] spoken she becomes the light of that
[1:23:30] word T now it isn't just a written word
[1:23:38] to us it's a reality we are in him
[1:23:42] now we're rejoicing enjoying now we
[1:23:45] behold him now we see him the word
[1:23:48] manifesting himself is here out there
[1:23:51] because why it's veiled in human flesh

[1:24:00] he was yesterday yes he is oh all that

[1:28:18] assured me things and I can't explain it
[1:28:21] that's all I can tell you some things
[1:28:22] you just don't tell but nevertheless to
[1:28:27] say I don't make mistake I make mistakes
[1:28:30] but the blood of Jesus the grace of God
[1:28:36] is unconditional less than and the Lord
[1:28:39] didn't have to do this for me
[1:28:42] he's done it for me you didn't have to

[1:29:38] going to heaven when I'm gonna hold on
[1:29:39] to this floor I have nothing to offer
[1:29:47] God except for what he's given me and
[1:29:50] that's his dear son
[1:29:52] that's Christ that's my token that's my
[1:29:57] life
[1:29:57] that's my lifesaver I have nothing else
[1:30:01] like Abel had nothing else to give God
[1:30:04] but the lamb that's all I have thank God
[1:30:07] for a prophet who brought us the bloody
[1:30:11] bleeding word of the Lamb that's what he
[1:30:14] called the message the bloody greedy
[1:30:17] word of the Son of Man Father we think
[1:30:25] you know for your goodness and your
[1:30:27] grace you know my heart and I honor your
[1:30:34] prophet law because lord I I can
[1:30:39] somewhat see all that he had to go
[1:30:41] through to get this message over you
[1:30:44] didn't even spare him Lord like it
[1:30:47] didn't even spare your dear son Jesus
[1:30:49] you didn't spare him from heart aches
[1:30:52] and pains and trials and tribulations
[1:30:54] and father
[1:30:55] you're not going to spare us either but
[1:30:59] I pray Lord Jesus that when you return
[1:31:06] father that you remember us
[1:31:10] take us with your father we believe Lord
[1:31:15] even as your prophet Paul said sometimes
[1:31:21] to do what's right it doesn't always
[1:31:25] come right that good that I would
[1:31:29] sometime I don't do father
[1:31:31] but I know your blood has covered us I
[1:31:35] know your
[1:31:37] has protected us and your mercy in door
[1:31:41] to all generations
[1:31:42] I pray father for the family of God in
[1:31:45] this church now you be merciful to us
[1:31:50] Lord forgive us for being so good
[1:31:54] further if you give us other things we
[1:31:57] come short in and give us grace to grow
[1:31:59] into your perfection help us now in
[1:32:03] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen so that
[1:32:10] you will be aware whether Connelly will
[1:32:17] no longer be cleaning up the church he's
[1:32:22] been a real warrior I love my brother
[1:32:25] I'm only a mousing this so so that if
[1:32:29] something's is out of order you won't be
[1:32:31] blaming him or his wife they have served
[1:32:35] as long as I know and we so thank God
[1:32:39] for them both in the family there who
[1:32:41] have actually done a wonderful job but
[1:32:47] you got to understand we're growing
[1:32:48] older and I've always marveled at our
[1:32:52] brother stem stampers strength but you
[1:32:56] and I can tell that he's slowing up a
[1:32:57] little bit only in his physical his
[1:33:01] heart is still young and vibrant and we
[1:33:04] thank God for him and in his wife I know
[1:33:07] my daughter crystal said that she'd be
[1:33:09] willing to help I'll clean the church
[1:33:12] and so if there's no one else we'll just
[1:33:15] let her do it and how she does it there
[1:33:18] between her and God but we're believing
[1:33:21] that that should do a good job it was so
[1:33:23] amazing because she said some things
[1:33:25] about this some time ago and and I
[1:33:28] thought well you know and to a girl of
[1:33:30] collie tails I'll say something
[1:33:32] differently I'm just gonna let it go and
[1:33:34] then he came tonight I just wish we
[1:33:39] could just I know he is not asking for
[1:33:41] anything I just wish I could do
[1:33:43] something special for him because
[1:33:45] brother Conley has done so many special
[1:33:47] things for me and I know that he's done
[1:33:49] these things
[1:33:50] only because God is in his heart is that
[1:33:54] he and his wife I just believe it all my
[1:33:58] heart they are bride I just believe that
[1:34:00] and I've seen God's work in action
[1:34:05] through them now I'm carrying on because
[1:34:07] there's so much in my heart you know we
[1:34:11] we disagree some time but we still stand
[1:34:13] with each other and I really appreciate
[1:34:16] him I've never felt a difference in the
[1:34:18] spirit and I trust and hope he had felt
[1:34:21] you know a lasting one anyway
[1:34:24] but I do love him I really do I love him
[1:34:29] and his wife and family and whatever
[1:34:31] God's will is or him let it be done amen
[1:34:35] you love the Lord
