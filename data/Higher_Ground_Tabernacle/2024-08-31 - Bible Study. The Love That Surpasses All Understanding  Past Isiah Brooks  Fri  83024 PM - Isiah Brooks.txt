TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e B e us our that's what Christians areel connect I am are now we know by the grace of God we have the Holy Ghost but you got to understand in order for God to have a complete flow through you you got to unstop the vows you know because a lot of vows have been sto stopped up and clogged up in whatever the case may be but those things can be cleared out and clear e e and that life must be exemplified through us we can't be like them we have to be better than they are there's an echo somewhere GL start orever of the season and if we are trees the Holy Ghost in US is telling us the sign of the Time of the Season I mean we don't have to look at the the television set or anything else the broadcast systems whatever they doing we don't have to look at that to determine the season if something in US tells us that and and let me say it like this it told Enoch yes sir it told Enoch amen what time it was and the Bible said Enoch walk with God hallelujah see so I'm I'm telling you that this message has is is in a place is telling us the season and the time or the season that we're living in is rapturing time it's time to mature and it's time to love one another in spite of all of our differences amen because remember God put the differences there yes sir every one of us are made different in some way or another even though we be human beings amen right and each one of us can testify that we receive the holy ghost in a different manner amen that's right but you got it amen you see what I'm saying so anyway so we must be connected and something told him within him there is a city and he started looking for it and said I'm a pilgrim a stranger and I'm looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God he know the city was somewhere and that's what brother said where where Abraham stopped he said the city was right above him amen ain't that amazing in the spiritual realm in another dimension the city was there so we must understand by the grace of God that that that what you're feeling that that you're getting amen is not in your mind it's the spirit of God telling you it's about that time amen endeavoring that means you got to work for it you got to work hard huj you know it doesn't just come easy right you know and and you know and I know how arts and problems and everything comes and everything but the Bible said don't let no Bitter Root abide in you ameny try to keep yourself as clean as you possibly can and when I say that it doesn't matter how much you hurt the pain in itself is a part of the process you can't grow without pain amen right and and it's pain sometime you can you feel like you can't bear it highly bear it but it's what God has placed on you and I think about the cross and how Jesus you know set his face like a flint he knew the season he knew the time when they tried to kill him at an early stage he wouldn't allow it to happen because he knew what was prophesied of him and the things that he was supposed to go through in order to achieve uh his purpose in life in this world so we see these things but we must understand that we're one unit amen one unit can I say it like that one body baptized into that one body by one spirit amen and you'll never see this my hand slapping my face if this hand starts slapping my face you know I need some medication it's not a normal thing your body works together left hand right hand and the right hand never scorns the left hand amen right and the left hand never scorns the right hand amen they all work together and this is what we must learn how to do by the holy Spirit can I say it like this the Holy Ghost in you in me will lead you and guide you into what all truth all truth doesn't mean just knowledge it it it brings you into the Life of Christ this is what it's all about it's not the great depths of the mystery it's coming to know that in this day that same Jesus is living in you Hallelujah performing The Works that he wants to be perform amen and as you heard me say on Wednesday you might be the boy with just a few Fish and Loaves that's all you was ordained to do you might be the woman that God told to put two pennies in the in the plate you were born and raised and God protected you until you put the two pennies in the plate then you never heard no more about her am you understand me it ain't that you got to be raising the dead and casting out Devils everybody's not gifted for that but every body has a purpose and whatever that purpose it could be just just as humble as all get out like brother Bram had neighbors who was kind to him amen and he said they'll be there amen that's right see so you you you know they may not even come to the knowledge of the message but because they were good to you they'll be there Hallelujah and we don't we don't have to figure that out that's God's business amen that's right see but when the people see life in you and and and everybody wants to live everybody wants to smile believe you me everybody loves to be happy amen it is a thing right and when people see you as a happy Christian cuz a lot of Christians are Christians but they're not happy amen that's but when they see happy Christian it draws people to you amen right they can't they want to find out what this light is and like like I said even on that plane when that lady said I see a light you know she saw a light on me which I wasn't aware of it but somehow God opened her eyes to see and that's how it is and I know witches devils and all see light and they know who you are by the light you shine or reflect right listen the Bible says this second uh excuse me Colossians I'm back to my my point here Colossians sometime charity is is taken into a position where people say it's just being good to somebody amen just being good to somebody but love is more than just being good to somebody amen right it kind of like water things down the the the the the direct word of that word charity is love which is divine love right so Paul is telling you know the Ephesians you've got to Endeavor you got to worked to keep it because you got to understand you got the devil on every side anybody know what I'm talking about right I had battles today anybody was ex was exempt anybody no no no you going to have battles every day but it's your job to keep the devil off yes amen you must pray you must allow God to uh uh keep a wall of fire about you amen right because we realize what what makes the Holy Ghost kind of move away from us when we make an error and don't correct it Amen brother BR said the holy spirit will move off like on another Branch until you make it right then he'll move right in amen see he'll never leave you you'll never be out of his sight he can't it's impossible but he will step aside until you get right with him amen right he did it to the prophet you're a hypocrite make it right then you go pray that's the way it works any questions any comments okay go ahead brother um if I may say so I believe that you know thinking about Love U it's it's almost like how let's just take the city there's a there's a substation of Powerhouse that provides the power to this city and if one point in the city if there's a breakdown it stops the power that's wonderful and God is the PowerHouse of his people yes and if there's a breakdown within his people it everyone suffers that's true that's true and also I believe that's very closely connected with Fellowship because love and fellowship is like a Dynamo yes sir the more love the more Fellowship absolutely Fellowship and it goes and it goes and it goes and grows and grows and grows like a snowball absolutely rolling down a hill and Gathering more and more snow that's true and I believe that we we have a lot of breakdowns because that's true brother you're being right it's only right put myself in that also but but I really do believe the love and the and the fellowship just perpetuates itself The More Love the more Fellowship more Fellowship the more love that's true and I think that's what we have to focus on I think that's a good point it's a real good point anyway did everybody hear what he said it is so true and I think I love that analysis brother because it's absolutely the truth and that's why the Bible said contend for the faith you have to fight for it and and the faith is one faith not your faith my faith and somebody else's Faith the faith is God is love amen yeah and we must learn how to like he said I I believe that to be true the more love the more Fellowship the more Fellowship the more love and the thing about it that's why Satan put these things in our minds and our Spirits oh this one is this this one is that this one is this and when we don't fight against that if we accept his gospel how do you know it's the devil when it's always negative amen if it's negative more than likely it's the devil amen and and we must learn how to fight negative thoughts and put it behind us or if you feel like something is going wrong you got to start talking or praying somehow you keep Satan off you so that you can be free y'all know what I'm saying there's nothing like being free you're free in your thoughts you're free in your life right and I agree with that brother that's true and I believe with all my heart that the more we pray because I don't think personally I I I I I think prayer is where cuz you know have you ever felt when you pray and you've had a good prayer feel like you love everybody amen you just feel like there's a love there's something just just pulsating through you and the reason why we we're not seeing because people are not praying amen but the people that pray they have a connection with God that makes them have connection with the people but those who don't pray the connection is broken and this is why we're suffering from with Fellowship suffering with loving one another you know it's there but we have to learn how to stir the Kool-Aid up like I said right let the peace of God rule in your heart to which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all what wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord listen and whatsoever ye do in word or deed if you can't do it in word or deed in the name of Jesus Christ is not of God Amen giving thanks to God and the father by him right so what are we doing we are coming to a place where what God wants us to fight to keep Satan out amen keep him out of your mind keep him out of your spirit right most of all keep him away from your flesh yes sir because what we're here to do we're here to show the light of God right now here brother brandom speaks and I'm I'm come like I said I wasted not wasted but I got up behind time but you you guys don't mind listen I'm going to read this John 17:3 says this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent amen listen to what that what he's saying here this is life eternal that they might what Know Thee amen eternal life is knowing God Amen the true God and knowing Jesus Christ whom thou sent amen that's what eternal life is it's like I I think I know him no it's knowing him and he he and and and and him knowing you amen right now here Jesus is saying I do nothing in myself but what I see the father doing and God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God had confined himself to one body do y confined himself to one body that was was his son through the death of his son brought God to the entire church Universal through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost through the blood of Christ cleanses mortal man and make them not in themselves but by the grace of God through his grace makes them subject to the holy spirit that he talks and walks and preaches and acts through his church his Vine or his branches that connected in him that's you understand me and so Paul is trying to tell us how to continue to be connected it ain't about just you it's about a body amen that's how we keep connected not with just me it's about a body right and and you got to understand God put you in this body or in this little Fellowship amen and we are to stay connected in God by staying connected Ed with each other am and it go back to what brother brother Rich says more Fellowship more love he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he that doeth the work I do nothing myself but what he tells me to do or show me to do show me to do so Jesus must have no other way to make the scriptures right then Jesus had to see visions of what the father's will was to do then he went and done it if you read the and read the preceding text of that you find that it's true for he could not have passed great multitudes of lame blind Hal and wilter and went to one man laying on a pallet and healed him for he knew he had been in the condition he had been in that condition for many years now we find out then that he was just walked at the father guided and directed him now the lesson to us is this everything that we do in the spiritual aspect is supposed to be by God led by God Amen not your feelings led by God Amen right and so when you're led by God is because you have stayed connected with God and being connected with God you know what God wants you to do right like God said call that sister call that brother right you don't even know why but you know you need to amen and we those little voice don't you understand me when you're faithful unto little God will give you much amen if you just do those little things then you find out your ministry becomes greater one way or another it becomes greater now how many of y'all pray for your pastors Hallelujah good for you because I'm sure God tells you to pray for me that he tells me to pray for you amen that's how the chain works that's how the connection works and we must Endeavor because I'm going tell you something it is Satan's job to steal kill and destroy it is Satan job to come into a house and divided because he knows that if a house is divided it cannot stand and when I'm talking about A House Divided I'm not talking about your personal house but it can be your personal house I'm talking about the Church of God Amen my question is where are the people even tonight amen it's because the breakage the power breakage right all right I'm going just go back to the Ephesians here Ephesians 3 19-21 you could never love a person too much not with the love of God that's right can I say that again you can never love a person too much with the love of God because his love is past understanding amen and when you feel like you got it all under control or you understand exactly what it's all about no you don't amen love breaks barriers you know that we've been taught that in the scripture when you when we had the the the the U Samaritan and and and and and the Jew how they they crossed over you know when the when the when the rabbis and the priests saw the man beaten and lamed they cross they cross over they didn't want to get defiled they didn't want to be defiled defil and here was a Samaritan who was considered defiled comes and he helps the man amen that's right paid his hotel bill and his you know doctor bill and everything else you understand me now God puts that in there because being religious doesn't bring you into a connection with God that's right being connected with God is knowing how to hear from God and obey his command and sometime God will tell you to do things that seem to be stupid Amen to your reasoning but at that time it's the right thing to do right Ephesians 9 excuse me 31 19- 21 and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that he might be filled with the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh where in US us you see this is what and and this is where the devil gets us all the time here God trying to bring us to Perfection right well how you going to be how God going to bring you to Perfection if you still limiting him with these Natural Things amen you you limiting God here how you expect to get there amen the scripture says he's he's he he he'll do now to him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above am beyond your comprehension that's right and that's why brother said don't don't pray for the little things pray for big things am we act like God can't do big things it's like when God heals somebody from the cancer like it's such a great miracle that ain't even a drop in the bucket that's right yet we act like this is something fantastic it's not only in this Dimension we make it like that because somehow our unbelief become belief amen that's right but God wants us to have faith in his word if he says it that's the only thing that's going to make us mature you can't doubt God's word and think you're going to mature no you mature with faith believing God's word standing on his word no matter what amen right and when you stand on God's word guess what you're going to be do what's going to happen to you you're going to be challenged that's right whether it be sick sickness social whatever the case may be you're going to be challenged and sometimes sometimes the battles are so great is almost like a spirit of confusion comes into your mind amen yeah I don't know what I'm doing I'm speaking about myself I mean it does it brings you into a confus usion we're not the only one when the power when the pressure came on Moses he got confused he start crying out like everybody else you know God had to shake him a little bit wake up you know and put him right back in the in in in in the grid where where you're supposed to be and you and I must understand we cannot I don't know how to say it what I do know is that the more you encourage some somebody the more encouraged they become amen thank you Lord when you when you speak positive to somebody the more positive they become but you start speaking negative that atmosphere comes because you're creators amen that's right yes sir amen and you create your own atmosphere oh Lord why is it like this cuz you create it you you bringing the storm clouds amen I I've been I'm a witness of that the more I say I'm tired the more tired I become that's right good word and we must learn how to speak against those things even though it's real don't get me wrong it's real being tired but you got to speak against it amen because when you don't you become more tired am oh I'm so confused don't you got to speak positive what I'm trying I'm trying to learn I'm trying to tell you something it can you find in the scripture anywhere any place where Jesus spoke negative about himself or any condition he found himself in not just Jesus I say Paul Paul said I've been in every every kind of situation and I learn how to be obeyed I learned how to be exalted I learn how to give thanks amen so it is a learning process process but we must allow God to teach us cuz we are headed for Perfection amen not of this but the inner man amen and this is what we must concentrate on that inner man becoming Perfection per perfect how you know it's going to happen it's going to happen amen and it's not going to be according to your knowledge that's right cuz what he's working with supersedes anything your mind can comprehend amen because if we pressed on our minds we'll still be woe with me I'm such a sinner right when God has Justified us Sanctified us freed us from all these things and like I said on Wednesday it's not the blood plus it's the blood amen any questions comments for those who were didn't hear Brother Rich say that and I think it was a powerful thing he talks about the power that we all are tied into into the city there's a there's a unit that that really take push the power out and every time there's a break in connection it literally stops the flow of everything and and it's so true I mean it's it's just true it's like okay when your telephone line goes out lightning strikes that what they call it that big thing on the pole anyway Transformer and then everything goes out because that power is transformed it it shift out and when you hit that everything's go out amen and that's how it is in the church when people don't understand onebody weed that's what Paul was trying to tell them that's why Paul said you a little leav leav is the whole lump you can't allow certain things to creep into the church and when people know things are in the church and they don't do nothing about that then that affects the church amen it has Will and always will right now to him that is able to do what exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen amen now now here I go what is wrong with our praise I was talking to a young man today I says I've heard people say well everybody can worship Him no that's not true that's not scriptural everybody can't worship God Amen the Bible say let everything that have breath praise the Lord everybody can Praise Him and there's a difference between praise and worship worship is your life amen and if you're not living right you're not worshiping I don't care how much you praise him your worship is not accepted you got to worship Him in spirit and in what truth and that life is what he's trying to tell us and and listen we we we we are tested uh with each other most of the time most of the time this is where your battle is your about the Bible says the enemy is of your own household well you know nothing affects us like church and people in the church amen and we forget that sometime people are Moody sometime people are going through things sometime you know we all go through things but now we must understand your love must cover it amen the Bible said love covers a multitude of sin amen and our love must learn how to overshadow and and brother randam taught us like that oh they didn't mean it that way you know that's the enemy you must always push back the Flesh and see the enemy not the person that's right come on Ephesians 4 1-8 I remember a brother I hadn't spoke with him in a long time brother Shelly but he was uh telling me about things that were going on in his church and this was years and years ago and they would come up to brother shy brother sh is it [Music] true is it true see that ain't the person you go to brother sh ain't the one that did wrong the person who you know but people who hear things instead of going to the source they go all around amen that's confusion that's right and Satan is the author of confusion Ephesians 4 i f if somebody want to know something about me the best best way to do it is just come straight to me I'm going to either tell you the truth or tell you a lie and if I tell you a lie God gonna make me tell you the truth that's just the way it is Ephesians 4 1-8 no I've got it all messed up here I'm sorry the 11th verse please how did I do oh is my eyes my eyes 1-8 I therefore I saw that one and that eye is 11 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you what walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called now that's a whole mouthful amen your vocation you have been called unto Holiness you have been called unto righteousness you have been called and the sanctification and it says walk worthy of that amen walk worthy right because here Paul says I what the prisoner of the Lord besee You Lord in other words I'm a prison I I want to be a prisoner amen I want to be so tied up and Tangled Up In God Amen to nothing makes me look right or left you understand me I want to be that to say I'm completely there no yet no no no not yet I'm getting there but my point is I'm I know I'm moving forward and not backwards right with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering for be one another in love right should I repeat that one with all lonliness and meekness not Pride not Pride not Pride arrogance and all that that ain't gonna work with longsuffering and many of us need that for each other I can use a lot more of that myself long suffering forbearing one another in love and you know what that is cuz a lot of time we want people to change when we want them to change no they change when God changes them amen he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in what the bond of Peace you don't go up into somebody with the wrong protocol with your fingertip I don't hope nobody's in here like that but my point is I mean you go in meekness you go in love you go you know that's that's listen you know and I know when you're talking to somebody and they raise their voice your voice is going to raise too if you're not careful there you're going to elevate your voice like they elevate theirs and sometime people don't even know they elevating their voice that's right and sometime you say why you saying it that way or lowered it look down you know me because sometime people don't I I've know that to be true but there are times when you don't catch it so when they raise their voice you raise their yours and then say why did you say it like they don't even see that they have been but it's a spirit amen that's right it's a spirit people trying to cause confusion between one 2 or three amen y'all know what I'm saying but love would check it bring it back to its right perspective that's right like wait a minute now that's that's not going in the right way and you hear what I'm saying what do you call that fighting for what is truth that's endeavoring that's dying to yourself and putting yourself out in in the Forefront to be trampled upon to make it come back to his proper place that's right endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and once you make a mistake you come back and make it right that's that's where the devil don't like it he don't like it when you come and make it right there's one body one Spirit even as you are called into one hope of your calling what is Paul saying lumping us all together could be a thousand people in here that's born of God and every one of us we are a part of one another we may be separate in our bodies but in our spirit our Holy Ghost we're supposed to be the same am and if you got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the word what is it going to do bring that Unity cuz God hate division amen that's your word right one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and the father of us all who is above all and through all and in you all right but unto everyone of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ what he saying some people receives more grace than others that's right it is a gift of God wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men and we know what that's all about when God gave the fivefold ministry and all of the five-fold ministry is what to perfect the Saints One Pastor can't do it you need other preachers coming in amen giving giving what God has given to them to you right it takes five fingers to hold the thing fivefold Ministry to hold it right wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen now Ephesians 41116 Ephesians 4:1 11:16 now his love is past finding out now we we must understand we can never put a cap on love that's right well I'm sorry you done cross that line too many times you better watch that kind of a thing cuz how many lines we done cross amen that's right huh and I'm guilty sometimes I don't want to go no further with people don't look at me like I'm crazy I'm just being honest I'm talking in my flesh sometime you don't feel like it and the Holy Ghost says uh-uh you got to keep going that's right if you want to be perfected you got to go you can't run from this I didn't run from Calvary and you can't run from your cross amen amen amen can't do it you got to face it right and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some some pastors and teachers for what the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we come all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man now y'all understand we said the unity of faith it doesn't mean Baptist message Presbyterian all that no no no no no the unity of the faith of the word the revelation of this day the Holy Ghost is the unity of the faith Hallelujah that's right that's what it is until we all get the Holy Ghost when we come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God Amen because one thing about the Holy Ghost when you got the holy ghost at that day you'll know he's in you amen you know he's in you now unto a perfect perf man unto the measures of the stature of the fullness of Christ and we know what that is you come through those virtues and all of those things so we know that the Holy Ghost is building us into these places and you know what you can't do it without the storm and the rain amen all of us got to go through it not one person is exempt and to be honest with you I don't want to skip grades I want to go through every grade every test every trial I must through I want no blemishes left am God knows my heart and and sometimes I tell the Lord and I mean that I nobody loves to uh how can I say it uh we don't love to suffer we don't love to be ashamed we don't I don't care what it takes to bring me to Perfection amen because that's my inheritance and I want it like Joshua and Caleb I want my Mountain give me my Mountain Hallelujah I'm almost done he said cuz Ephesians got too many little things to it there's no way I thought I was going to be able to finish it but we're going to keep on until we finish it that we henceforth be no more children 14th verse tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait deceive to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in All Things speaking the truth in love may grow up into all things which is the head even Christ amen so we see that growing up in him is a process it's what we must do and we must contend we must fight right there's no way you're going to just sweep through this it's no way it ain't you know and I think about it sometimes and and I'm trying to finish uh because of the time and I try I try I think about this time things like that and I'm I'm just in my mind I'm thinking I'm sitting in the house the storm is Raging lightning is flashy and those trees can't even move they can't run for shelter amen they're planted there and if the lightning decide to strike in that area that tree can't even Dodge the lightning amen you understand me God has planted it there and and that's the way I want to be so planted in God to whatever storm comes I'm standing amen and if he decide to prune something off let him do it Hallelujah let him do it because I just want God to finish it I want to be able to produce the fruit and the life that he wants me to produce I can't do it on my own neither can you yes sir but when you fight with what you have you said well wait a minute brother listen I'm going to tell you about a old man by the name of Abraham they were farmers they didn't have no no no no no no swords and everything they had H Farmers equipment maybe some hoes and you know rakes and whatever they had they did not have what the Army the other the army they were going to fight had they didn't have no shield and Buckler and all of the uniforms they just had simple instrument amen and they whooped the enemy and recaptured lot amen and God is saying use what you have you may not I don't have it you know there's some people that could Out quote me there's some people can reme memorize this word better than I can but all I can do is use what you know what what God gave me that's what I use I'm not the deepest preacher in the message but that ain't it either you could have all of that and have not charity I'm trying to get the thing the main thing amen is what I'm after and that's what you need to focus on the main thing you don't have to be educated to get it cuz Peter and them got it amen you know so all I'm trying to tell you is Ephesians is a powerful book there's so many things and I'm just jumping something from one place to another but I'm trying to give you some of the things that means a lot to me to give to you because you are fighting right now there ain't no way you can be in this message and not fight amen you in a Warfare don't you forget that every day but you got to come out of this thing every day feeling like you're a conqueror you don't go to bed feeling like you're a failure and you've lost it all you go to bed feeling like you're a conqueror and my point is if you feel like you're not a conqueror you get on your knees until you feel like the Conqueror amen cuz Christ going to wash you away wash wash wash you and cleanse you of everything you've ever done during the day time Satan can put it on you but God can take it off amen so you got to remember that go to bed as a conqueror as a Victor so that you can rise up as a
