uh their time with him to share with us the talent in which they have you know words cannot express my gratitude when it comes to what we have heard these couple of days it has been life-changing for me and i just thank god for his grace and i believe with all my heart what was ministered especially this morning was something that everybody needed uh because you know we we all being in this house of flesh we we we we need jesus and most of all we need his blood we need the covenant we need an unconditional one i'm not the preacher but i'll tell you what i can't hardly wait till he gets up here amen we share the same holy ghost that's right i don't know how that's done but we do we all do and we just thank god for his mercy and his grace brother jesse means a lot to me we've been friends and brothers for a long time it's so amazing because um i would say almost twice his age but nevertheless we have been friends and you know there's a time when brother troy myself and jesse went over we were in guyana and we bonded in such a way we had a wonderful time and you know i sat back as they were being eaten up by the mosquitoes god was good to me i spoke to the mosquitoes i said i'm a servant of the lord you can't touch me by god's grace i came out squeaky clean you know sounds crazy but i believe like he said life and death is when they're done tonight and the lord told me to talk to him if i feel good the prophet can speak to bees i can speak to the mosquitoes so i know that sounds crazy but it's real we love the lord and we're not going to prolong the time we just say continue to pray for him that god will continue to bless him and strengthen him sometimes we don't know how tired we are until the meeting is over we're on the plane going back home and we feel like we almost can't make it to get you know once we hear so anyway we thank god for him we ask him to come forth amen sing preach whatever he wants to do this is the last service before it's ended here and uh truly i believe with all my heart i know that god allowed him to come hard to get him here but we finally got him showed that prayer changes things we thank god for him we love him we ask that you come brother amen god bless you sir take care [Music] i took a picture of you all and i sent it to our song leader because he's got a vision of what he wants our musicians to be like i said that's right that's where it is right there right there yes sir yes sir appreciate you brothers my what a blessing you're in the house of god serving god like this beautiful let's go to uh a scripture i'd like to go to job chapter one i've had this message i preached it at cam church partially and then i preached it at our church it's been a tremendous blessing to me you know you go on and you serve the lord years and years and years and then there are certain things that just there's such great revelations they stand out and to me this was one of them about job uh so my topic is is perfect in heaven imperfect on earth so perfect in heaven but imperfect on earth so i hope this will be a blessing to you it seems like when i do that it's too loud so i'm sorry if i'm i don't mean to blast anybody if i do that so just love everybody in the lord just love everybody the lord okay okay sorry about that buddy job chapter one so my topic is perfect in heaven imperfect on earth and a subtopic this is what came to me job's victory over lodesian conditions i never saw job as me before but now i can see job overcoming laodicea rich and increase with goods have need of nothing but he had to overcome that how many want to overcome that in our day god bless you job chapter 1 verse 8. god does great things on sunday night services we have we have them every sunday we have 11 a.m and 4 p.m service every sunday now they're cancelling today so they can go have lunch with their families but every other sunday we are in the house of god because i learned if i don't give god the whole day i'll start working and then i don't have a sabbath right and the holy ghost came to give us a sabbath in our souls but i also realized my body needs a sabbath i got to have a day of rest and so brother branham had two services and so i want to follow that example praise god i want to give god the whole day job 1 verse 8. let's read this together just verse 8 let's read it together on 3 1 2 3 and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and a skeweth evil escue with evil now go to job 38. i trust by the end of this you'll see the revelation behind this imagine i could just say like this it's the power in the blood we just sang about the blood brother perfect fitting for this message the power in the blood job 38 now when we read this remember who's god talking to here job who is he talking to another verse satan so when he speaks to satan he said job is perfect nothing wrong with his life he's completed but watch how job is talked to by god verse 1 then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thy loins he's talking to job gird up thyloines like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me the hebrew meaning of darkeneth is hide or confuse advice who is this that's hiding the sound advice who is this who's confusing with wrong advice yet he just called him perfect in heaven let's have a word of prayer here if you ever need on your heart let's just make it known unto god heavenly father we just come reverently before the throne of grace we thank you lord for the songs that have been sung they've refreshed our hearts lord god they've brought us into your presence and here we are in your presence we're thankful for the blood lord when you see the blood you'll pass over us thank you god for letting the blood lord the life of the blood speak to us today father lord it saved our souls it sanctified us it filled us with the spirit dear god we're so grateful yet we still need your instructions so lord we just pray by the holy spirit your blood would speak to us today father god bless your people lord i know sunday nights can be a challenging service but lord there can also be such a blessing if we all get one accord so help us to be in one accord tonight and father speak to us through your word in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god it's good to see elijah and abraham god bless you brothers praise god sure love them and appreciate your testimony brother god bless you elijah great to pray with you yesterday brother that was a monumental day for us by god's grace beautiful day beautiful so thankful for his amazing grace god is so worthy to be praised so i'll set a timer here i just like to do that so i can keep track of myself and i don't wear you out too much brother brahm said some people fill up easy some people feel fill up with a lot in other words some people can only handle a little bit of preaching that's okay he said but some people need a lot of preaching because they got a real big appetite for the word i trust that by god's grace we'll be able to receive all that god has for us tonight praise god god tells satan job is perfect but when god comes to job he says who are you that confuses my advice who are you that hides knowledge what a striking thought how many ever consider that thought before you ever consider that thought we know the testimony god was bragging on job to satan he was proud of his of his child right he said he's just like me right he was bragging to satan because remember the how the the book opens job is blessed in all of his ways how many blessed in all your ways right and the bible said the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and the lord asked them what have you been up to where you been going so we realize this son is not talking about us it's talking about angels praise god because brother brahm tells us in broken cisterns and also the church age book there's no such thing as pre-existence of souls where you were in a body before you came to earth he talks about it in who is this melchizedek he said jesus went the regular line from thought to theophany to flesh to glorified he said but we come a different way we come from thought to flesh then to theophany then to glorified amen hallelujah and so when the sons come to present themselves it's god showing he has control over all good angels and demons amen he forces them to come and present themselves and stand before him and he limits them praise god i'm saying hallelujah i'm so glad he restrains them praise god and it's true because god said or satan said well you've got a hedge around him thank god for the hedge of the blood amen hallelujah i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of praise god the hedge of jesus's blood protecting me from devils amen hallelujah they try to take your life they try to do different things and destroy you and car accidents and all these things but brother we've got a hedge around us it's the blood of jesus christ they come try to get to us and they're repelled right away amen because the blood of jesus christ hallelujah and god as the ruler of the universe makes them all stand and say what have you been up to says well i'm going to and fro he said have you considered my servant job there's none like him in all the world praise god well he said well that's because you protect him take all it away and he'll curse you to your face right and we know the story he gets he goes down there he takes job's children all these things job gets the victory at first right he gets the victory and he his children are lost but he praises the lord and he gives god glory he starts out those struggle he starts out to fight really good right and then the lord comes down again and allows some more he said but just don't touch his life then he's then his health leaves and he's covered in boils the bible said he had skin that was purple and black and peeling and it was it was just it was an awful condition historians say he struggled for nine months in that condition and the bible actually says months these months of my affliction and he didn't even go a year think about that some of you have been through years of pain job suffered awful but it was only about it wasn't even a year now look how merciful god is church look how merciful god is he's going to test his his child job but he doesn't let the test go too far because it's a really hard test and i want to say this job had great faith amen i'm never down in job i'm never down in john the baptist but we know what jesus said jesus said those in the kingdom of god are all greater than john the baptist if you're the least in the new testament you're still greater than the old testament because of the power of the blood amen praise god because we have we have access to more power than they have see david could slay the giant of goliath but he couldn't slay the giant of adultery and the church said that's why in the new testament we should have power to slay that giant too praise god brother ma'am said when i'm out on the field he said i might be uh tempted by a woman he said if i made a mistake i believe my wife would forgive me he said but my comforter won't let me do that hallelujah why because he's got greater power that's the difference of the new testament the power in the blood the power in the soul praise god amen and so we see the picture of job we know he was continually offering sacrifices and we just think oh we could never be like job i hope by the end of this you'll see you're a lot like job brother brooke said it earlier this morning he said we've got to constantly repent and that's what job was good at amen that's what that's what a reality was to job he had to constantly give offerings church we don't kill animals but we have to give a offering the bible said a sacrifice of praise is an offering a prayer is an offering it's incense coming up before god if we're not praying we're not giving sacrifices we've got to pray and we've got to sacrifice like job it's got to be continually praise god amen and he said that's a man he said that's perfect that's a man that skews evil that means he restrained and he avoided evil right like the bible said resist satan in other words fight back from fight back right and he'll flee but you got to fight it praise god you can't just give in to the sin you've got to fight against it praise god and that's how job was in many ways he resisted satan he escaped evil he hated evil he ran from it and god looked there in heaven said have you considered him he's my perfect son hallelujah because he was constantly offering blood sacrifices and let me say it like this if that was the power of animal blood what about the blood of jesus amen what is god saying about you if you're believing in the blood of jesus christ if you're constantly trusting in the blood of jesus christ what is jesus telling satan right now about you brother he's perfect amen have you considered my servant he's perfect praise god what is he saying he's got to be saying what the word says the bible said you have you you have no more uh transgressions praise god the bible said he's taken all unrighteousness away amen and you're walking the light as he is in the light amen what is he saying about us brother keith all these years what has god been saying about us in heaven brother brother brooks he's been saying he's perfect praise god and they're saying well you're protecting him well i thank the lord i've asked for protection praise god i don't want to serve the kingdom of darkness i want to say the kingdom of light like yesterday we saw it brother elijah you know i forgot to bring out this scripture the bible said this day i set before you blessing or curse choose you this day whom you will serve i want the blessing amen i want god's spirit praise god i want his anointing amen i want his love i use blood praise god i want to be perfect i want to be like jesus amen in fact i was made in this image praise god man is made in the image of god amen nothing wrong with wanting the blessings of god just know you got to have a few trials in between there you might have you might have to have a job trout god forbid but you might have to have a trial like that in order to prove what you are hallelujah so the point i'm making if you got your bible first john the point i want to make first john 3 9. i was talking about this with brother keith he talked about the seed when i was out there first john 3 9. do not let satan tell you you're lost do not let satan tell you you're not perfect you are perfect if job was perfect you're perfect if you're trusting in the same thing the blood amen hallelujah first john 3 9 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of god a christian has three parts a soul spirit and body once the holy ghost comes into his soul it's sealed off from satan it's no longer a soul of unbelief like it was now it's a soul of faith or belief amen hallelujah praise god and then the bible said it has a new nature because bubba says your soul is your nature praise god now you have god's nature god's desires god's will amen and that soul doesn't sin what sins is our human spirit either consciously or unconsciously right because sometimes satan gets in there he can put bad dreams in there we didn't mean to do that we wake up in the was that how many times that happened to me i have awful dreams i wake up and think did i do that did i god have mercy i hope i didn't do that satan tried to put death in there so i said satan get behind me praise god hallelujah get behind me you have no power for me amen and i can be happy i didn't do that praise god jesus dropped the charges amen i never did that in the first place amen god for the blood amen that's right so the soul doesn't sin when you're born again because the bible said he's quickened your soul that means made alive now the nature or the will or desire of you is always god's will but you've got what we got to get our minds to overcome on the battlefield hallelujah we got to overcome in our minds that's why the bible said present your body as a living sacrifice unto god which is your reasonable service that you can have your mind transformed to prove the perfect will of god i'm not wondering if me being a pastor is the perfect will of god i proved it amen hallelujah before i ask god if i should pastor but elijah i prayed i opened my bible i said god just let me point to one scripture if it would encourage me if i should pass to the church open my bible i did that brother ram did it's the only time i've ever done it in my life so i'm not telling you to go do it but when you do it you better be sincere oh in fact it might have been a bible like that the scofield bible and it went to timothy turn to timothy real quick here went to timothy 1st timothy god knows my heart remember lydia was she might have been sitting there on the floor but she was so so tiny first timothy yep first timothy 4 12. i just opened i closed my eyes i pointed right there and i said i said that's the scripture let no man despise thy youth i started pastoring it 25 years old so many brothers you might be preaching pretty soon you might be pastoring pretty soon right so got to raise up another church somewhere who knows we'll see what god does but you need to be ready let no man despise your youth be an example of the believers in word and conversation and charity and spirit in faith and purity till i come give attendance to reading exhortation doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on the hands of the presbytery meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee now i prayed numerous times god show me if i'm supposed to pastor and god would always always answer church you don't have to wonder if you're in god's perfect will or not you can prove it but you need a transformed mind your mind has to be that word transform means light jesus what it means transfigure jesus was transfigured before them all bright shining light like the sun so your mind has a time when it's dark we talked about this morning and then when it's transformed the light of god has entered your mind and now you understand the things of god the light has come there's no more question there's no more doubt about it the light shines and you can see hallelujah so that's the human spirit now the soul can never sin but the human spirit's got to be renewed daily you need a daily transformation or transfer transfiguration like jesus we need a daily experience where we go up in the presence of god and our minds are transformed right that's what the bible says be renewed in the spirit of your minds now you know the heavenly courtroom i talked about that talked about broken cisterns hallelujah now let's go to the book of job here we'll try to get through some numerous scriptures here i'm just trying to hit the highlights here go to job 2 verse 3. i want you to notice how does god prove job is a perfect man to the devil how does he prove that verse two chapter two verse three kind of mentioned it earlier and the lord said in the satan hast i consider my servant job that there's no man like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escu with evil and still he holds fast his integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause what was god's proof that he was a perfect man he hated evil praise god he feared god right what the bible says upright he did what was righteous now where was the signs miracles and wonders in there now if you if you if you do that they'll follow you praise god right but god never says well job did so many miracles because that would discount john the baptist because he didn't know miracles the bible says so don't worry about the miracles be concerned about fearing god living upright and separating yourself from evil influences and trusting in the blood in fact that's what the blood does the blood makes you want to separate amen the blood makes you want to live upright because you see something died in my place i should have died but something died for me and i'm living with gratitude because of that amen so how does god prove you're perfect the blood and then the blood shows that you fear god you're upright and you separate yourself from evil you young brothers could be a lot of places tonight getting involved with evil but you you've escaped evil tonight god bless you for that you're on the road praise god you're on the right road now go to hebrews 13. i want to prove it to you as well hebrews 13. verse 20 hebrews 13 20. thanks for your patience here this one just come to my heart now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus christ that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant do what what is the blood of the everlasting covenant going to do saints oh hallelujah verse 21. what's it going to do it's going to make you perfect in every good work everything you do is going to be blessed hallelujah when you love god when you serve god everything your hand touches god is going to bless it amen and the blood is gonna make you perfect so when you're daily repenting daily seeking the kingdom of god saying god i'm seeking your righteousness i'm seeking jesus's integrity amen i'm seeking jesus's honesty i'm seeking jesus's humility amen i'm seeking jesus's righteousness i'm seeking jesus's humility who said let not my will be done but thy will amen when we seek that the blood of jesus makes us perfect and every work we do is perfect and it pleases god did you know that look at his says well pleasing in his sight working in that which is well pleasing his sight did you know in 1st timothy 2 paul tells them to pray for leaders and all these things he said and so that we can have a quiet and peaceable life which is well pleasing in the sight of god god looks down and he sees just a humble peaceful life just going about your day loving god witnessing testifying god sees that as well pleasing in his sight someone that can live in peace instead of war now we've got to have battles every now and then right in the churches and we got to overcome enemies but i said satan will anoint somebody with poison and send him into the church he said but you withstand him praise god amen god will take him out praise god but that's our desire if god is in you then you are trying to live a life of peace and the blood is gonna make your life perfect and everything you do god is gonna bless it and it's all gonna happen by the blood of jesus in other words the forgiveness of jesus how many thankful to be forgiven tonight glory sounds like heaven love job because god's up in heaven saying this is my son have you considered him how many know heaven loves you daniel 9 23 gabriel comes down and talks to daniel uh daniel 9 23 and he says remember he had to answer the prayer for three weeks because there's a spiritual battle going on and don't give up church if you haven't seen the answer to your prayers just keep battling in prayer there's spiritual wickedness going on in high places may god give us patience praise god may god give us longsuffering that we can suffer long amen and wait till we see a change in the people's lives daniel 9 23 at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved can you imagine an an angel telling you you are greatly beloved well where'd he get that message he's just a messenger from god amen angels carry god's message how great we would feel to know that an angel says heaven loves you oh my hallelujah and paul tells those philippians he said you're greatly beloved amen hallelujah see the blood makes us loved right he said the bible said while we were yet sinners christ died the righteous for the unrighteous the bible said god commanded his love for us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for the unrighteous amen that proves how do you know god loves you because he sent his son to die for you praise god heaven loves you and the more you pray like daniel three times a day well you can pray more than that right right the more you pray the more heaven loves you remember that angel came to cornelius and he said i want to tell you there's memorials of your prayers up in heaven remember that your prayers your fastings your all giving he said there's memorials up in heaven what's a memorial something there to remember by so god so these ain't that angel that came to corneas he must have been walking amongst heaven and said oh look at this memorial it's a memorial now where does the memorial come from let me read the details oh this is the life of cornelius he don't even have the holy ghost yet church and he's got as a sanctified saint he has this memorial erected to god oh wow look at these prayers look at these alms look at this fasting hallelujah brother brooks i believe you've got memorials in heaven brother hallelujah the more you pray the more you fast the more you give alms heaven records it amen it goes it doesn't go miss god sees it and you've got it on your heavenly bank account praise god and there's no moth there's no worm right hallelujah there's nothing that can destroy that treasure that's heavenly treasure the bible says that's a weight of glory amen hallelujah you've got a weight of glory jesus said do it in secret and i'll reward you openly hallelujah an angel will come down and tell you listen your prayers are up in heaven the bible said vials are stored with prayers at the opening of the seventh seal those vials are poured out all those answers to all those prayers at the rapture are going to be poured out amen 2 000 years of prayers about the rapture are going to be poured out at that time amen praise god it's a fire falling time amen it's the latter rain time amen it's the holy ghost falling time amen where we're swaddling up death is swallowed up in life amen hallelujah ah heaven is so close to us heaven is so real a couple months ago church my six-year-old daughter saw an angel right outside our house brother we've asked her four or five times every time the details are the same it matches brother branham's details almost perfectly she saw a vision my six-year-old and i was just preaching on how if you live the right life angels will visit your house hallelujah now we're praying he comes back amen but we know in one sense they never leave amen right because there's angels guardian angels sent to us the bible said the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear fear the lord and that's right she just came up for prayer on friday night to get the holy ghost i don't think she got it but she come up just crying wanting the holy ghost my set now she's seven heaven loves you how do you know because they sent the greatest gift to pay for the price for your salvation praise god that's how you know the king left his throne in a spiritual sense right the king left the throne to come down and serve the people to be with the people amen to love his people praise god heaven come down to earth to bless us glory greatly beloved daniel greatly beloved bride of jesus christ you're greatly beloved how many believe that now the bible says they accuse satan accuses us day and night before god but we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony if god said that about job under the blood of bulls and goats he's got to say the same if not more about us under the blood of his son praise god now let me move to this thought here remember church we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous he was made a propituation for our sins that means he was made a mercy seat for our sins the mercy seat covered the ark right it was just that top piece on the ark and that's where the blood had to be sprinkled jesus became the mercy seat that that lid as the lid it covered the law the law was saying judgment judgment you haven't kept it but the mercy seat was saying i'm gonna forgive you and that something's gonna die to take your place that you can still approach me amen jesus christ took our sins he took our shame praise god he's covering over our judgment but we know he does more than cover over it he abolishes it amen he abolishes it he was made the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also the sins of the whole world if they'll receive him thank god for the advocate jesus christ now church job's life was he's the ultimate christian businessman i heard a preacher say that he was the most spiritual man in god's sight now i'm not going to get into comparisons but if god had the most spiritual people in that day i wonder who the most spiritual people are today it's those that ask evil it's those that fear the lord praise god so god has a man today praise god god has men today who's the most spiritual men of that day god has an order i just hope i'm in the order somewhere i'm probably the last one but if i'm in that order hallelujah i'll be the happiest man there ever was amen but there's an order of people that serve the lord and job was at the very top because god god numbers the very hairs on our heads so god has a number mine keep falling out you know but you know i got a pretty good amount you know hopefully thankfully they haven't fought out too much but if god knows all these numbers and all these things then he knows those faithful servants who are praying fasting given alms and they all rank in god's kingdom some are more spiritual than others job was the most spiritual of all of them oh god help us to be spiritual it's not a competition brother man say you do works because you are saved and paul said i labor more because grace was with me see when you live by grace you want to do more for the kingdom of god i'll make sure i want to bring that thought out he's the most prosperous man most beautiful family loving servants a man of worship he didn't take the salvation of his children for granted he kept praying for his children right now we don't have time to go through this but here are some of his godly attributes job job was the definition of living with eternal life the bible says in chapter 29 verse 13 he made widows and the fatherless sing and rejoice so he would go visit the widows in the church and give them things and help them out he would go visit the children that had no dads and he would go visit them and help them out the bible said he loved his enemies in job 31 verse 29. the bible said he did not trust in riches in job 31 verses 24 and 25 and then the in chapter 31 verse 32 the bible said he helped strangers now we're starting to measure ourselves up aren't we i see each person kind of calculating their minds we should we ought to we ought to do good works a christian we do good works amen job was a godly man he overcame listen this brothers he overcame sexual thoughts about other women the bible said i made a covenant not to look upon a maid now you talk about a spiritual man he had all these outward victories and he also had inward victories now remember church he was sanctified but he could never be filled with the holy ghost because jesus hadn't paid for sins yet turn your bibles to john 7 37 let's read that so you got it brother branham says it too on multiple occasions i've got like three occasions where he said that i appreciate your attention everybody's doing a great job here i know it's sunday night i've lived through them i've you're doing good by god's grace amen john 7 37-39 just stay with me stay with the word keep hungering and thirsting for righteousness praise god in the last day that great day of the feast jesus said and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me now do you catch any man right there amen he just offered any man come and take the holy ghost everybody's welcome praise god now he knows who's going to come but the invitation has to go to oil so don't let satan ever tell you god don't want you to get the holy ghost god does want you to get the holy ghost praise god he said any man let him come and drink of these fresh waters of life you'll never be the same you'll never thirst for the world again amen look at the next verse verse 39 can you pull it up there but this hate speaking of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified when john the baptist was full of the holy ghost when his mother elizabeth and his dad zacharias were filled with the holy ghost it wasn't in their soul it was in their human spirit god couldn't fill them in their soul yet because jesus had not paid all the sacrifice for sin praise god that's why when jesus rose he knew the blood was accepted he took his own blood to heaven present to the father and then he breathed on and said receive the holy ghost receive it now because heaven's sacrifice has been accepted praise god god's sacrifice has been accepted now you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost amen so job church job could be so sanctified he had faith virtue now now look temperance he didn't lust after other women temperance means you have power over bodily passions like lust of the eyes right pride of life lust of the lust of the body so job was all over look at him broadly kindness and look at godliness look at his the bible said the patience of job without the baptism in the soul he was able to live such a high life what can we live amen with the baptism of the holy ghost in our soul praise god hallelujah church my my desires my goal is living a much higher life than i'm living right now and i know it's possible because jesus said all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah let's not get the solomon syndrome the solomon syndrome is when you get old things turn your hearts away from the lord his many wives turned his heart away from the lord it's the same thing that happened to uzziah the bible said as long as he sought the lord he prospered but when he desired to become a priest and left his position then god stopped blessing him he went in there and offered incense and he was smote with leprosy what a sad ending to our life to a life that is we don't want a sad ending to our life we want a crowning to our life amen right we don't want a life that's crowding in disgrace oh my i'll say like this church the best is yet to come for your life i'm going to preach at home when i get home i just caught that thought the best is yet to come you say prove it i'll be happy to prove it moses the first 40 years of his life not so good second 40 well he's a father now but the last part of his life was the best part of his life amen abraham first 75 years but those last uh 25 35 years was the best part of his life he was walking and thus saith the lord amen god would visit him and say go move here and go to this and separate yourself he was walking in the word of the lord hallelujah brother branham he thanked god for the first full second paul but he said that third poll is the thing i've waited for and wondered about all my life amen the opening of the way praise god the opening of the revelations of god speaking the word having the power of the word of god but told this story about a preacher i think it was billy sunday or maybe another preacher he was on his deathbed and all of his comforters you know i had his deathbed were saying you know you're going to go you're going to be saved and everything and they said what was the best time of your life was it when you were 25 and all strong and preaching the word when was the best time in your life was it when you were you know like 30 or 40 and the brother said what are you crazy he said this is the best time of my life he said because in five minutes i'll see jesus christ i'll see him face to face amen the best is always yet to come amen this bride is receiving her former reign the teaching reign but let me tell you the best is yet to come the lettering rapturing faith amen the best is always yet to come right now it's great it's greater than it was before because i'm sharpening eight arrows at my house brother isaiah i'm sharpening them and one day i'm gonna release them out at the gates of the city brother keith so when i'm a grandfather and i when i'm a grant lord willing to see if the lord tarries kind of maybe i'm prophesied but you know i'll shoot him out as a young man third i'm 40. in 10 years or so i'll be shooting some of these arrows out but when i'm a grandfather my children will be raised up they'll have victories in their lives if the lord is willing and of lord teres and then they'll be sharpening arrows for the next generation so see each each stage of our life is the best stage because you can see the testimonies of your life compile up over the years praise god amen and then the closer you get to death the closer you get to see jesus amen hallelujah the best is always yet to come always don't let satan tell you it was better back then now that could be true for someone like solomon so the thing to do is repent right look at david's life now his was kind of he kind of that solomon thing he committed adultery and then he numbered the people i forgot how many people thousands of people died 75 000 or something like that 70 000. he kind of backs a little bit at the end of his life too but may god help us not to backslide me included all of us may god help all of us to just stay as pure and as faithful and true as we possibly can because the best is yet to come church i believe that i receive that by god's grace i know that's true now let me keep going here by god's grace so see we are perfect in the soul but our minds and our bodies and we're perfect in heaven but our minds and bodies are not perfect on earth if we say we have sin or we don't have sin we make him a liar and his word is not in us now church i want to just for time's sake i want to look at this brother abraham says this i'm going to read this in the book of job this is from perfect faith it says job feared and what he feared but abandoned says it actually happened what brought it brother ma'am says his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if he knowed it when it happened it wouldn't happen see what i mean if you're afraid when you come by a prayer line maybe i won't haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry but if you know it's going to happen it'll happen see it's a substance of something job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear your disease is going to leave you then it or leave won't leave you it won't if you have faith it will hallelujah now get your bibles here let's read a few scriptures at the beginning of the trial job was so strong he said the lord gives and the lord takes away but this trial was a fire he had to walk through and fire reveals what you're made of tests and trials are going to show what's left in your human spirit praise god we don't like talking about that but when we go through tests it really shows what we're made of the bible says got to be purified seven times the seven attributes of the statue of river man amen praise god look at job 9 17. let's go there i've been going 40 minutes so thank you for your patience job 9 17. look at jobs look at some of job's words after the initial part of the trial we start seeing some of his humanity well now before that yeah let's go to 9 17. for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause this is one of job's worst mistakes that he said he said god is breaking me and multiplying my wounds and i didn't do anything wrong elahu rips him apart with this later on he said you have justified yourself more than god brother brahm just told us his fear that he had in his heart is what brought this trial up upon him praise god amen this is one of the worst things job could have ever said oh i don't deserve this trial listen church every spanking we get we deserve it praise god and every one we got we should say thank the lord hallelujah glory the bible said god does not tempt any man he allows us to go into it but he can't allow us to go into it unless there's a purpose most times it's because of our own sin in job's cases it was fear go to job three i believe it's 25 here job three i want to follow up on that brother-in-law quote yes job 3 25 read that with me let's read it out loud you got it let's read out loud on three one two three for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me brother branham picks this up and he said job brought this upon himself but we're always told he's perfect he's perfect he was by the blood he was perfect in heaven but he wasn't perfect in earth so church he would make all those sacrifices for his children right he'd go in case anything happens he'd burn a sacrifice he'd pray but all the time in his heart fear was building up and the bible didn't say it was a little fear it was a great fear i greatly fear so job had an outward appearance as a man of god he'd help out people but there was times when he just battled fear oh i'm so afraid it's going to happen i don't want to lose what i got what if i lost everything i got church perfect love will cast out off here i've always prayed this i didn't even know before i preaches i always say lord give me faith like job that if the lord gives or the lord takes away i'll still say blessed be the name of the lord i don't want to be a slave to fear like that song says i'm no longer a slave to fear i'm a child of god but job became a slave to fear and so satan picked that up and god allowed this to happen but the whole time god knew my son he's going to overcome because he's got foreknowledge he know where he knows we're going to stumble he knows but he's got confidence we're going to endure the storm aren't you glad you're that god has confidence he knows the beginning from the end any trial he gives allows in your life it will never be too difficult to overcome and there's always going to be a way out where you don't have to sin but you can humble yourself and obey the word of god and get victory in the midst of the trial you do not have to fall to sin we looked at that remember king abimelech he took sarah and he's getting brothers that he's put on his pajamas at night and the lord said you're as good as a dead man. he said lord i didn't know she was married i didn't know she was married he said i know that's the reason i kept you from sinning against me if god will keep a heathen king from sinning against us but against him what about the queen of heaven amen what about the bride of jesus christ we're not heathens we're christians praise god but see integrity integrity honesty i don't want to sin against god and god looked at job and said that's what he's got but brother keith sometimes he just had my battles i'm going to lose my family i'm going to lose and satan took that and brought it before god and god said do whatever you want just don't take his life that's true whatever there's power of life and death in the tongue we looked at this morning right if we keep saying oh i'm worried about this i'm worried about that well guess what's going to happen speak the word hallelujah speak life speak good things right speak health be big victory praise god speak blessings don't let these things come out of our lives but as job goes through these months of trial we these fires expose more of his material what's in his human mind when it seems like god don't answer church when it seems like god don't answer sometimes we'll say the most embarrassing things the most ungodly things the most crazy things will come out of our mouths i don't deserve this i've known this this test has no cause yet it did everything has a cause it's all reaping and sowing is everybody with me today it's all everything in life is a reaping and a sowing and job said the thing that i greatly feared is come upon me may god help us not to fear praise god now for time's sake i got 15 more minutes there'll be an hour i'm not gonna preach hour and a half tonight by god's grace job says many harsh things job even demands i talk to god he demands god to come down and talk to him but ram said it was it was a sinful thing to demand god to heal to heal somebody remember that yet job demanded god come tell me what what what did i do wrong but all of a sudden god sends after after all these months of these three friends in job arguing who's righteous and who's not god sends a daysman brother brahm said god sent a young man down by the name of elihu come down to meet job a perfect type of christ again elahu means he is my god so job was crying out job was praying he said god is not a man as i am that i should answer him we should come together in judgment neither is there any days when betwixt us that he might lay his hand upon us both so job's crying out i need a mediator i need a mediator and god sent him one amen church if you need a mediator if you need a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities god has provided you one amen he'll send you one his name is jesus amen elijah is a perfect type of jesus christ oh my church it's beautiful job 32 verse 1 says job was righteous in his own eyes and then the bible said in 32 verse 2 the wrath of elijah was kindled against job look at this can you put that up there because he justified himself rather than god in some ways in the midst of the trial job was saying i'm more righteous than god that's why when i read it to you when god talks to satan when god talks to satan he says job is perfect but when god comes down to job he said who is this that darkeneth counsel against the almighty hello so you're perfect in heaven but you are many many faulty on earth and the church said god talks to the devil about you she's perfect he's he's a perfect man of god he hates evil but when god comes to correct you who are you who are you who do you think you are job to talk about me like that doesn't sound like a babying type of situation does it he wasn't babied by god was he no as a father corrects his son so does the lord pideth and correct his children this is some of the most beautiful revelations god showed me in the last few years job is a type uh if you've got your bible here let's go to uh go to job 16 12. i want to prove this to you job is a type of laodicea go to job uh 16 verse 2. can you put that up there brother when you get a chance thank you are you doing that brother troy thank you sir oh yeah sister thank you sister i love that look husband and wife working together my wife don't do anything like that so don't worry about that you know she she's gotta hold the baby the whole time look at this i'm sorry it was uh 16 12. i'm sorry my fault now look here's job confessing look what he says i was at ease but he had broken me asunder he had also taken me by his neck and shaking me to pieces and set me up for his mark keep that up there what was job doing at ease what did they say in the military at ease relax i do taekwondo they say at ease just relax if i gotta do something else i'm gonna waste my life i don't want cancer i don't want diabetes i gotta do something to work hard so job is a perfect type of laodicea he was rich increased with goods had need of nothing and he even says it spiritually i was at ease spiritually so when this trial came he was in a bondage to fear and he wasn't as diligent as he could be spiritually and the church said now the thing i love about the laodicean description he said i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire pulled up job 23 10 brother or sister sorry get them all mixed up so jesus tells laodicea come to me i'll give you gold tried in the fire what does job say he says but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold and this is after he had seen my redeemer that was chapter 19. i know my redeemer liveth and i'll stand with him on the earth at the last day praise god so what was in the midst of his trial sometimes he was up sometimes he was down sometimes he had revelations sometimes he had trials sometimes he said good things sometimes he say bad things sounds a lot like us go to job 42 5. the bible said and jesus said anoint thine eyes without i salve that thou mayest see does that apply to laodicea job said i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my eyes this is amazing amen job is a perfect type of you and i going through laodicea rich and increase with goods have needed nothing but you've got to be gold we've got to go through the fires and have gold brother said it's christ-like character patience tried and tested by fire praise god an eye self that you can see seeing is always understanding in the bible seeing as always you understand well now i know what this means now i know why this happens sight is always understanding you know what you see so job is the perfect type of you and i as many as i love i rebuke and chase him god chastens this man go to job let's go i think it's 40 go to joe 40 i think it's 40. now we saw job 38 right yeah go to job 40 here yeah we read job 38 god rebukes job in job 38 1-3 he says who is this can you imagine can i just dramatize this real quick for all those days job and his three friends just start sat arguing one would step up and say you're this that they'd finally sit down ah yeah i really gave it to job job would stand up and say [Music] i really gave it to them and the next one would stand up and after all their blabbering some clouds started coming off in the horizon job had said earlier i demand to talk to god i've done nothing wrong and yet he said all these things pretty soon the storm starts coming in then you hear the wind blowing pretty soon the wind all gets into one spot as a whirlwind and a whirlwind starts forming by job and his three friends and allah who's standing right there the whole time too you know he's like and all of a sudden now the world when god speaks and says who is this that darkeneth counsel he said gird you up your loins like a man in other words when you grind up your loins you're ready to work in other words joe come on show me what you're going to do show me how powerful you are gird up your loins show me what kind of man you are and god takes job on a virtual tour of the entire universe he starts by zooming out and saying did you lay the foundations of the earth tell me what are the pillars of the earth can you tell me how they hang there then he goes to the scene he says can you tell me how deep the sea is remember job said let me talk to god and god didn't ever answer this question god asked him questions he takes them up to the mountains brother keith and said do you know when the goats bring forth their babies do you make sure they got enough milk he said can you loose the bands of the stars of orion can you kind of change where the constellations are he said where is uh darkness is home where does light live can you show me where the snowflakes and the hail are stored up in their treasure houses can you tell me that he asked him over 60 questions he goes through all the universe and then he ends with these last two two animals dinosaurs he shows him the brachiosaurus and said can you handle this brachiosaurus his tail is like a cedar tree then he takes him to the sea and says can you handle this leviathan this plesiosaurus that breathes fire can you handle this he said you can't even tame the beast and i made the beasts hallelujah in other words we must not talk against the almighty god amen we must not accuse him of anything wrong because he does everything right amen we're the ones that make mistakes we're the ones that are guilty but he's made a way that we can have fellowship through the blood amen through the blood are you with me tonight i appreciate that let me find a little place to close so what were job's failures he had great fear in job 3 25. go to job 33 9. sister i'm gonna i'm going to give you a lightning round here okay job 33.9 i want everybody to see this before because i'm not making this up this is right of the bible look what allah elijah says about job i am clean without job said i'm clean without transgression i'm innocent neither is there iniquity in me in other words a lie who's saying you committed iniquity you said you were you were you were free from all this he said you had fear you had iniquity in you you know what to do is right but you didn't do it all the time go to verse 12 and we'll go to verse 12 33 12. behold in this thou art not just i will answer that god is greater than man so job is saying i'm just i'm fair i'm righteous and elijah's saying you know you're not you're more he said you were saying you're more just than god go to verse 17 sister this lightning round you're doing a good job so far he that he may withdraw a man from his purpose and hide pride from man so joe elijah's saying you've got pride pride has built up in your life pride iniquity fear but yet in heaven god said he's my perfect boy there's nobody like him oh hallelujah go to job 34 37 this kind of nails it down here 34-37 then we're going to give our sister round of applause for her lightning round here 34 37 the last one job the last clear sin is he rebelled against god for he added rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplies his words against god go back and read job if you haven't look at some of his statements he said where's god i need to talk to god i demand god come talk to me i did nothing wrong that's proof you did do something wrong you're talking like that so out of all job's good when the trials came he had a lot of bad too fear iniquity pride laziness rebellion i hope this is helping somebody elijah says job was drinking up scorn we don't have time to go through this he was in other words he was drinking up mocking against god he was scorning against god just just dissatisfied with god's treatment of him he drank it up like a cup it's in job 34 verses 3 through 9. elijah says elijah justifies god and eli who says if god would personally reply to you job men would turn to dust is what elijah said and then elijah who says job is condemning god the most just one and i'm putting these on here for people that watch it go look it up in your bible in church we need to do more of that we need to go look up these in the bible don't take my word for it you go study the word of god romans said when you get those tapes go study in the quietness of your room and see he said see what god will reveal to you that's the trouble people just want the preachers to study for themselves preachers need to study but you need to study too if not you're going to go study something else and the church said if you don't study god's word you're going to study something else i've seen friends do that they were so close to god in our church but they started studying business more in the word of god and their lives have just fallen away from the word they'll let makeup in all kinds of things evil video games before they would have never thought of that but because they stop studying god's word their minds go study other things and they're not strong enough to fight off temptation anymore right there's my hour so i'm going to set a timer for hopefully i can finish in 10 minutes i like to keep track of my preaching i don't want to wear you guys hallelujah so in other words god comes in a world when he basically says job who are you you're an ignorant man because he just asked him 60 questions and he couldn't answer one of them what does god want us to be humble are you with me we don't know at all praise god can you tell me any of these 60 questions job said no i can't tell you anything let's read what he said i think i had you in job 40 right yeah job 40. look at joe 40. look at verse 3 then job answer lauren said behold i am vile look at that saints we ought to rejoice he's perfect in heaven but he realizes he's still vile on earth but the man said we walk through this world and we got to keep our skirts clean sometimes we get vile when we get in the flesh god said he's perfect but down here after god talks to job he said i'm so vile just like peter right jesus said casternet on the other side he's like fine we we did it all night go ahead they pull the net and there's so many fishes they can't handle it he falls out and said lord depart from me i'm a sinful man that's what we all are praise god we're all sinful men we all need a savior amen what shall i answer thee i will lay my hand upon my mouth what's my answer here's my answer god i can't answer any of those questions once i've spoken verse 5 but i will not answer yey twice but i will proceed no further then the lord answered joe by the world and said girl thy loins like a man i'll demand of thee and thou declare unto me look at this church god wasn't babying him around like a little baby god would say no you asked and demanded i come down here i am now i'm demanding of you tell me god don't play around the holy ghost is the holy spirit not an unholy spirit be careful what we create with our words we must be very careful what we create look at he says in verse 8 will thou distance my judgment see job had disannulled god's judgment said god judged wrong god's treating me wrong god never treats anybody wrong i'll say it again god never treats anybody wrong will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous what was job doing he was condemning god job was condemning god for letting these trials happen but god said it's you're just passing through a fire you need to pass through the fire to get rid of all your jaws amen how did this that you can come forth as gold amen i want gold character i want christ like character you have to go through fires god judges everything right god is holy everything he does is right whatever happens in your life is good thank god for it amen you're going to condemn me god said let me ask you some more questions that's what he did you want to ask him more of those 60-some questions go to job 42 verse 1 then job answer the lord said i know that thou canst do everything that no thought can be withholding from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not look job in the prince of the holy ghost the prince of that whirlwind brother keith that holy spirit he finally gets honest and he recognizes reality i have said things i didn't understand i judge myself righteous and i accuse god of i condemn god notice church he never cursed god he just condemned god by saying his judgment wasn't right and the whole time brother elijah god's saying he's perfect in heaven you have a sacrifice to cover your sins devil he's perfect but when he deals with his son down on the earth he said you've got a lot of problems you really need to be burned up you really need to be cleansed hallelujah the bible calls it a refiner's fire brother jesse i made lots of mistakes that's fine he's just refining you praise god you're going to be better after this trial gets over after you confess your sins you'll be a much better christian because you're going through my fire but you've said some things you should not have said and see the holy spirit will show how vile we are how many can say amen to that anybody anybody seen their vile nature their sin nature lately i have utter things too wonderful for me in verse three which i knew not here i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me i have heard thee by the hearing of thy ear but now my eye seeth wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes now you know he's he's the example too he's the example of his the last part of his life was the best part of his life because god bless his children god bless his finances the bible said god gave him double so church we can expect hopefully by god's grace double blessings amen double peace double joy double mercy last scripture james go to james i'll pause right here because i'm almost out of hour yeah i'm almost at hour and 15. james i hope this gives you a real good understanding of job and how it's so much like your life job five i'm sorry james yes i'm sorry thank you appreciate that thank you job i'm sorry james 5 11. forgive me i'm human forgive me james 5 11 behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job church this is an anointing these are anointings you receive brother man said they're like portions of god's holy spirit portion more holy ghost more holy ghost more holy ghost until the holy ghost comes to live there himself you've heard of the patience of job as before the holy ghost could come so job what helped him get through his trials patience you've heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercies can you imagine god forgave job of job condemning god what if somebody condemned you would you be quick to forgive them and then reward them a whole bunch after that church god has divine love he is divine love amen god is love amen and god is very pitiful he's very merciful we count them happy which endure so let me tell you this if you're going through a test of faith i don't care how long it's been months years decades i don't care let me just encourage you with this endure it confess your sins right confess any sin that's what job had to do i repent i abhor myself in dust and ashes let's stand to our feet here's what trials do as you're standing i'm just going to go the musicians could come brother branham said look at job a perfect man this is in questions answered on the holy ghost 59 and god permitted the evil devil to come upon him and chastise him and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit these trials were just making perfect but yet god already said he was perfect well yeah part of him was perfect but part of him wasn't his human spirit his mind his thoughts wasn't perfect so the trials came to make him perfect there's four reasons god allows us to suffer self-judgment and humility that's what job said i repent i abhor myself the second reason god gives you trials is so you'll obey the word next time the third reason so you can be more fruitful after the trial is over and the last reason you can be a testimony to others that you went through the trial and just like job if you endure you'll come out as gold on the other side and the church said let's bow our heads here [Music] heavenly father we're grateful lord for your word lord i want to just thank you personally this message has helped me so much lord god as i've seen brother branham's mistakes my own mistakes job's mistakes all of our mistakes we've all fallen short of the glory of god and roman said in every mouth is an open sepulchre every mouth can be a grave of dead men's thoughts and bones oh god and the tongue is untameable by man but it's tameable by the holy ghost hallelujah lord my prayer for your people tonight is first bless them for being in your house dear god we see most the church don't come some of them might have a reason why they can't but lord for those that could lord forgive them lord god and may they repent and come closer to you and put a special blessing on these that have come that when they go through trials they'll remember the promises of god that they're going to be more perfect they're going to be more obedient they're going to be more fruitful after they get through the trial and lord let their words please you may they not speak anything against you forgive them if they do lord god bring them to a self-acknowledgement lord of their current condition [Music] lord that they can bring forth fruit that pleases you lord i've been
