just going to get right into the word of God Hallelujah I appreciate him kind of holding the service for a while for me because the enemy tried to pull a trick on me I thought my uh iPad was charging up when it was charging down so by the grace of God we're here and we're just going to go right into the word of the Lord and when it goes out Jesus steps in amen you love the Lord I love music of all kind I just do I can't help it just in me when it comes to worshiping the Lord is what I'm speaking of God is good to us and he's worthy to be praised no matter what you feel like you have to put forth your best effort sometimes just to tell the devil no matter what I'm gonna do it any on how amen we have just a little subject tonight and it's actually um dealing with the training what God is doing for us we spoke a message about the Shekinah Glory and and when we were in um Murfreesboro we spoke on he is she is Shekinah but you know those things are really good to say and it's really good to know but you also need to know that we're in an army and what God is doing for us today is what uh he's already planned to do and as I said you know when it comes to God we must realize that the battle has already been fought and the victory has already been won you know it's just like brother Branham say even the Gospel of Jesus Christ when we preach the gospel we preach to that everybody's going to be saved we preach like everybody is bride but we know by God's grace everybody is not but we have been commanded to throw it out like that to put it out like that so that God so that um those who are ordained to catch it will catch it by the grace of God you love the Lord and we appreciate God and all that he's doing as we stand let us go right to the word of God we're going to come from first Samuel the 17th chapter I know our brother Isaiah preached on David a little bit and you know I was inspired by his message but I'm just going to go a different a little different way than what he went um you know I appreciate all the help God has given us and we are in a time that we must um girdle up The Lawns of our minds we must be sober by God's grace and I could have announced I could have used as the power and the authority of the Bride but I wanted to to emphasize the word training uh training for the battle and that's where we are right now because there is a great battle and we understand that the battle is basically fought within our minds right now it's between belief and unbelief faith and disbelief but we we know that um in it all God is going to work out his will I I love the very fact that before even God laid the plan out in the Physical Realm uh Satan had was already defeated amen first Samuel the 17th chapter we're going to read the 33rd verse beginning there and Saul said to David Thou Art not Thou Art not able to go against the Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and a man of war from he and for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and I smote him and delivered him out of his mouth when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him I love David's attitude because he was not going to allow the devil to steal not even one of his sheep and he went after the enemy and that's what I feel like we sometimes fail to do when somebody Falls sick uh whether it be with cancer or would it whether it be with any type of disease that will take us out we sometimes fear but David says there is no fear for the Lord is my shepherd we we don't look at conditions we don't look at what the devil calls circumstances by faith this is our our Revelation and it's not by our faith the just shall live by his faith we've moved up to the ladder you know when we were in denomination and stuff like that many things were done by and through our own faith that's why they were able to say Lord have I not done this and Lord have I not done that but in this day the just shall live by his faith because we've moved from just the baptism of the Holy Ghost into a realm where Christ himself is standing as the mighty angel in the mighty Soldier before us amen you love the Lord and when I and I went after him and smoked him and delivered it delivered it out of his mouth and when he aroused against me I caught him by his beard and smoked him and slew him thy servants stood both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the Lord of our God right let's turn to Proverbs 28 15. and I'm going to read it from the other new version or the better version of csb uh but it gives a clear uh understanding to uh what David was against because David wrote this he says 28 15. a wicked ruler over a helpless people is like a roaring lion or a charging bear now he describes his uh basically what he went through with Goliath but you see uh we must understand that David had no fear because he knew God was with him let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you and we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for being so good to us and so kind to us Lord without you Jesus we would be nothing and we pray father God that you would bless this service in a special way give us what we stand in need of Lord tonight and we'll be as we say careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in your in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated right now we're at a time where we must understand amen that the battle is not going to get easier we're at a tough time there's a time uh where we must understand that uh it's been ordained for us just as much it's been it was ordained for David to fight Goliath now the truth of the matter is he never thought about one day he would be fighting a giant but what we must understand that that the opposition that is now facing us is more like a giant it's something that it's with your natural eye you can't possibly think you can defeat them but we understand by God's grace that the the the the god that we serve is not only uh uh has brought down has opened up the word of God but he himself is here and he's now here to occupy our bodies to fight Even in our bodies and it was it wasn't David he himself that slew the giant it was God through and by David that slew the giant it was what we call Christ and we said that Christ is the Shekinah Glory Christ is God there's no difference uh only just a a a presence or how would you say a manifestation a different manifestation of God but the same God now here in the world we must understand that God is doing a great work and we we we we must yield ourselves to it and I find out that yielding is not so easy but it is what God is requiring us to do see the holy ghost that we're dealing with and and I like to say it like this because you know we understand that the Holy Ghost himself is a person not just a person he is the person he is the Creator and we must understand that the revelation of this creator that we're talking about must not be just in your head it must be in your heart and the only way he's going to get into your heart is that you come through the stages of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to be a clean vessel in order for God to come and reside in your heart but once he reside in your heart you have now put on the whole armor of God because he is the whole arm of God God David said he's my battle ax Amen in other words he's my he's my warrior he's the one I depend on I don't have to do anything but under his inspiration I can conquer all coming from the message uh uh uh you know Faith by experience the prophet of God says now God knowing that this last day there would come intellectual Giants there would come everything intellectual all kinds of uh all kinds of the enemy with reasoning power to try to prove to the church that the days of Miracles has passed and all this God packed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost with what speak with tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies gifts and all kinds of things they may seem hard in training but brother on the battlefield every one of them has got to be used God equips his Soldier exactly what it takes to use and this is what why we must understand and to whom much is given much is required and we must understand that here we are at a time when it seems like God Things Are not moving but for those of you I I sent a little clip that was sent to me and and it testified of this Pentecostal woman or they call a Holy Roller on this this one thing and this is a recent event uh matter of fact uh brother brother Ben narad sister is related to the sister that prayed and um this lady fell dead in the restaurant and and and and and she had some unbelieving people around calling the lady uh a Holy Roller but and she described these people who long hair long dresses and she said oh they must get ready to have a Holy Roller meeting in there not knowing that same Holy Roller was going to be the one who raised her mom or uh from the dead sister whichever relative it was but the point is God used these women to gather around this sister and one was a physician and they declared her dead and everybody that took her pulse and everything else understood she was dead but God through these sisters raised the dead in our day and so I was really stirred about that because I thought that's exactly what's happening uh when I was in Michigan I experienced the anointing and on a higher level than normal and and then when I went down there uh to uh uh uh uh uh Murfreesboro God did a great work there I mean the same kind of anointing where people would be filled with the Holy Ghost and healed and delivered and it was an awesome service I had nothing to do with it but one thing I want to say for certain he showed up and all I can say is that if we can get the people on One Accord it's amazing what God will do for us he goes on to say in the in in the in the same quote he says oh they might say just learn psychology that that won't work he said no sir that's that's as thin as the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken that's starved to death so that's no good we have to have power of the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him hallelujah it's not about the church it's about you it's a youth thing individually you and the only way you are going to get this is that you must die out to yourself and rot to your ideas surrendering to God is what we need but you know what the truth of the matter is we think oh what is going to be really if God said we are his wife or he says we are his bride you know we are a woman who is clothed in humility and we accept Jesus Christ as the head of Our Lives Hallelujah he said oh you say I don't I I just don't like to get down there he's talking about prayer I don't like to pray all night I don't like to well then you're going to be killed out on the battlefield you stay there till God equips you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you got need of in this world or the world to come live right in you that's all wise God knows how to equip his army he quips it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly what he sent for these last days that's your equipment and it must go down to the soul this is where the devil is deceiving a lot of people is on the flesh is on the spirit but it has to go down to the soul the Bible says I'm knocking at the door if any man would open up to me he said I will come into him and sub with him that's what God wants to do come all the way into us Hallelujah we can't just stop him at the bed I mean at in the living room we got to take him from there and bring him all the way into the bedroom where the intimacy of God is listen what he says he says now Faith by experience he said the biggest man and the biggest trained man and the more equipped man to fight the man was cowardly brother it doesn't doesn't lay in training it lays in experience and that's the problem a lot of Christians they have never had an experience but you say well what do you mean and when I say that I don't mean you got to feel chills all up your spine I'm not talking about Goosebumps and you know hair standing up on your head I'm just saying the very fact there have been things in your life that you know that you know that only God could have done it Hallelujah so when the Devil comes in like a flood you go back like David did Lord you you you you destroyed the lion you killed the band and so it was training and understand training and every time you go through training even when it comes to boxing when it comes to resting when it comes to football whatever the case may be there is a lot of pain involved but when the real Showdown comes you have been equipped Hallelujah you equipped and you can take the pain Hallelujah to endure the fight and this is what God is doing don't be the Bible said thinking not strange when you fall into diver's Temptation knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold Luke 12 32-34 says fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he finds pleasure in giving you the Holy Ghost he finds pleasure in giving you the kingdom but the problem with us we still have this Pentecostal idea that you gotta feel him you don't need to feel him feeling is all good but there's a lot of people who feels the anointing and they're still not filled he said in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me and I am in you that's what you need the Revelation that God is in you and when God is in you that Revelation says in you you become an invisible Army you don't mind the training Hallelujah and whatever the trainer tells you to do you'll do it why because it's for your own good Hallelujah you love the Lord is what God would do listen what he says brother welcome says this he said in the greatest battle ever fought 75 paragraph 75 he said if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be on in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there will not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be a nobody here designing the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your mind where you where where whether you will see what he's saying is because people many of them they have clocked themselves with so much religion they think their religion is their power but that's no power it's weakness see you say well what do you mean because Israel had a lot of religion but when Goliath came to face them they cowered down but he was a man who had an experience and knew that his anointing was of God that's another thing you've got to know that your anointing is of God I wish I could replay some of the things that took place even in in Murfreesboro you know as we prayed and and and and I'm glorifying God because something inspired me to say Lord the anointing that's anointing me feel these people and God did just that it wasn't me he anointed me I wish I could replay it or or cause it to happen now but it's something that he does he's sovereignty Hallelujah oh God help us here because you and I must understand we don't have to fear anything that's what that's what I've been really defeating the devil with because you know every one of us have had thoughts we've all all made mistakes and you know the devil will never let you you you forget that but you got to realize that when you you you're a new creature right not a patched up job so don't let him take you down memory lane when God Justified you according to this message you was justified as though you never said in the first place so why do you go down that lane when God has already Justified you Hallelujah he gave you the Holy Ghost when he knew he was going to make mistakes he know many of us were weird in our own way and he still gave us the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's not a man's approval that's God's approval Hallelujah glory to God yes Lord I'm not going to be long tonight but I just wanted to get this out listen what he says what's the matter you had to open the Channel first you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he is the word and he stands there there nothing going to stop it then there's nothing can every one of the uh uh every one of of the other channels is cleared out just like a old baller with the flu stopped up you got you'll put a fire in it'll blow your thing up that's what's the matter with so many blowed up Christians is it because they that they don't clean the channels out right they don't go down to the inside you got to cleanse it conscience memories thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadulterated word he said that is the truth so you got to clean everything you you you you you you know you bathe every day but you got to go inside of the inside and Only God the word can can go down into that depths of your soul and tell you what you need to repent from and people don't do it but you got to do it that's your tree in order to be fit for the battle you listen the part that I love about Jesus before he was crucified he said I know Satan's coming but Satan has no part of me and above otherwise he says there is no darkness in me and this is where God is trying to get us so that Satan won't have anything in you to pull on Hallelujah and I'm pressing toward the mark depressing every day I'm pressing I win some and I lose some but you see what I've got to go I have a Mark I know where I'm headed Hallelujah and you know what I don't have to worry about it because he won the victory and my victory is in him and because he won the victory I win Hallelujah we are new creatures that right but the Bible says once you get that faith in you once you get Christ and you the way you where you are he said you're like a solar system he said the moon the stars and none of them moves out of place everything moves and everything does exactly what it's supposed to do it's solid Hallelujah basically that's what he's saying once you get everything in place you become a solid Christian and Satan can't move you at all Hallelujah I'll read that to you about I did something to my little thing back there but he says now what you got then he said you've got a solar system Hallelujah if you get the stars in order and says hang there till I call you they they they stay there see nothing's going to move them when when God can get a man in his hand till he can get senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there he said that's right and the problem is we these eyes become lion eyes if God said with his stripes we healed that's exactly what he says that's what he means amen he had to teach Mary and Martha he had to teach them your eyes don't mean nothing circumstances mean nothing man should not live by bread alone but by every word of God every word that proceed out of the mouth of God he said if you believe it he said I'm gonna give you a test why don't you roll away that stone and they did and that stone was a type of unbelief Hallelujah they rolled it away and Jesus said now this day you're going to see the resurrection huh what did he say he didn't say uh you know I've got something over here to press a button he didn't use no kind of psychology you know what he said he said I am the resurrection and I am the life Hallelujah and they were able to see the resurrection in motion Hallelujah because when he called for Lazarus Lazarus got up oh I can't imagine what that must have been like but he got up a man that had been dead for days stinking but God in a moment's time brought every piece of his flesh Back Together made him brand new Hallelujah just like I was telling the sister down there she was talking about her condition I said well you ain't as bad as Lazarus was now if God can raise up Lazarus from the dead he can heal your disease he can cure it what is that Hallelujah these things are nothing but a drop in the bucket hallelujah we're like a grain of sand he's holding the moon holding the stars all of them none of them moving out of place because his word told them to stay there and so when we understand his word and the power of His word you just stay there speak it believe it stay there and watch it unfold because that's what Jesus did in creation he spoke it and stood back and watched it unfold he didn't waver we don't know how long it took to bring it to pass but he stayed there and he kept saying it's good it's good it's good and that's exactly what we must learn to do if we're going to be like him we must speak like him and there was not one word of Doubt ever coming out of his mouth Hallelujah he said a man can't even come see Hallelujah here it is a man cannot sin until first he cast aside God's word that's unbelief that's what sin is that's in the battle huh we can't do it oh God let this happen no no no no no we must come to a place as no I don't care what it looks like can you imagine how Moses was when he stood there at the Red Sea and God said telling him to stake out your rod and speak to it or whatever Durant see what kind of Faith see what we must understand it wasn't Moses faith it was God's faith it was Christ on the scene that's what we call the Shekinah Glory it was God on this that's what we want with us not sometimes all the time this is what we're striving for this is what we're pressing for every day we must die we must search our conscience we must search our Spirits our thinking our everything Lord show me have I looked at something have I done something have I thought something whatever it is cleanse me oh God constantly we got a must do we must do that Hallelujah don't feel bad you're not the only one all of us has to do this daily we should if we're going to move forward we must do this daily if we want God to come down and cap us off the way he's perfect you know to do listen he we are in training right now and many of us are failing because we're not doing just what I said cleansing ourselves on a daily basis foreign see the battle is not tomorrow the battle is now this is amateur now this is amateur you wait to the squeeze and the pressure comes and you know that you got to battle people battle devils and at the same time you got to love them that's something something get all upset like Peter you want to take somebody head off no sir you got to be like Steven's Lord forgive them for they know not what they do that's why we have the battles people is to perfect us it's to grow Us in character oh we all got a right to be what we want to be and do what we want to do but that's not what we're here for we came to be what he want us to be and we're living in that time when culture and education and things have smothered over the word of God and got into reasoning and so forth the Battle Is Now who will stand Hallelujah the battle is ready to go in she's arrayed now look what a great opposition we've got Yonder who will be like David said you stand and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God I'll go fight him hallelujah how are you going to fight him down on your knees you got to pray and hold God and don't let him go Hallelujah is that right wrestle like Jacob did hold him don't let him go Lord you promised Lord you promised Lord you promise don't let him go and you got to come to a place where you where no cannot be an answer five star general that's what he is five-star bride faith and Grace and Jesus see nothing can be done without him the Holy Ghost see started the church by giving them power and authority

nothing and that means abide abide that don't doesn't mean go in and out it means abide stay there right amen and that's where God wants us to be not in the outer Court not in the in the inner Court he wants it right in that Shekinah because that's where we belong that's him and her if I can say it like that that's God masculine excuse me and feminine there on the throne is that what he promised if you overcome I will grant with you to sit with me in my throne even as I have sat in my father's throne um that's his that's is what he's saying see and and and you say well he thought it not

the substance is drained so that's how it is it's what's in you the Bible is not a Coke it's the substance in the bottle that's the coke oh help us Jesus right see our minds is the channel That Satan is working in he is trying to convince us that we are alone and that the Lord is not with us and of course we know that's a lie right he has always been a liar the truth is where where where God has
