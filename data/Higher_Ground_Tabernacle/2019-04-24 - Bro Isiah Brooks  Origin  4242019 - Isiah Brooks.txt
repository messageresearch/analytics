TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the days of Noah we find out that God raised up a prophet by the name of Noah and that prophet began to preach he began to preach now he prepared listen we didn't know we thought oh the ark was built for everybody to go in there but if you read and I think it's a book of Jude it tells us that Noah built the ark for the saving of himself himself in his family so God only had a room of rooms that was going to actually take care of eight think about it and he looked pretty crazy right now I'm not come to preach on the Prophet but I wanted to say this that that is the way we know God is soon to come because God will always raise up one man that the world will hate he hate they hated Noah when Moses came they hated Moses when Jesus came to him with all these churches and you Jesus thank you only one right jesus said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins so God always have a warning before judgment right when Israel got so bad amen and they became so hard-hearted and stiff-necked God raised up Jeremiah God raised up Isaiah and what did they do they kill the prophets is that right oh yes they kill the prophet they soul dies then they they song Isaiah in half and Jesus even rebuked it he rebuked the Pharisees and the Sadducees well there they said don't even say Abraham is your father you're the guys that put him in the tomb say your mom and your daddy put them in the tomb and you going there to garnish it right so we understand that true preachers whether it be 20th century preachers or a whenever whenever God has an anointed man the world do not want to hear what needs to be said or what he's going to say so the appearance of a prophet is one of the ways we know because when Jesus came on the scene who showed up before John the Baptist and John was able to introduce Jesus to the church world but did they follow him no because they thought John was a crazy man right whenever you come to try to tell people about Jesus and tell him that he's not a system but he's a spirit and he's a free spirit you understand me and that he and God is one they say you are off your rocker now let's go on you're gonna have scoffers and you know in this day you know I remember the time when it all switched in my earlier days you know when you had Jim Baker and Tammy Bakker and all of the PTL people everybody loved them and Christianity in 1977 was flourishing healing this message was flourishing anointed anointing was falling people being baptized and the name of the Lord Jesus Holy Ghost filled people being filled in miracles in signs and wonders and here comes Jim and Tammy and they messed up and the whole world saw the Christian fall and it was at that time according to way I could remember people began to disrespect Christianity and saw it as a racket saw it as a way of making money yes they saw the spirit of Judas and here it is in the midst of all of that God was pulling a bride out of chaos because at that time for myself I could see the hypocrisy I can see the showmanship I can see the that the Hollywood nasaw of this Christianity had become Hollywood and and so I saw her that I was there I went to PTL and I saw the performance I saw how they acted and and this what they were doing they were acting for the camera and as soon as the camera was off of him they were laughing and playing and having making jokes and everything else as soon as the man said camera they got back on the stage and they act holy I saw it with my own eyes and I knew at that time in my life that's not what I wanted now buying you many people were healed in that ministry so you'll know that the gifts and calling of God is without repentance God calls you he gives you gifts but it doesn't mean you're saved right you can never be sure your salvation on the gift if that be the case I might get to heaven before some of y'all because they say I can sing but can i base my salvation upon my singing that's foolishness oh but my brother Samuel make it before I would because he can play the piano and I can't see it doesn't work like that I'm coming in just a moment but I want you to understand that everything looked chaotic it looks like it's off course but it's not everything that's happening right now is happening according to the plan of God is that right you had to realize that God has to shake the world just to get his own out of it is that right when God sent Israel a mentor to Jericho Jericho had to fall the great city of Jericho they had walls which areas raced upon them is that right and what did God shake Jericho down for a family that was led by a prostitute is that right a man it was Rahab who saw them though those are men coming it was Rahab who hid them in her house she literally lied for them and God still justified her Oh somebody help me here but you see God had to do that just to shake everything when God get ready for you guess what he does he shakes your world and you don't have to ask him to he's your God and he's going to do it anyhow hello you said well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm saying this even when it came to Peter James John all of them God went on their job and say follow me he went by the tax collector follow me and they had to quit they had to he shook their world guess what Paul thought he had it all together and God shook his world when it was time for Paul assault become Paul God intervened right so what I'm trying to say is that every one of us has an appointed time and when that upon a time is right God don't care about what you getting ready to do God is interested only in you and his purpose in which he made you must be fulfilled right so let me move back to this cheer a sign of the coming of the Lord because the Bible says according to Genesis that people multiplied multiplied look at this this whole world is multiplying in spite of all of the abortions it's still multiplying it's like in Egypt when they were trying to kill all the male babies they still was producing them nothing could stop it because God has seed and that seed must be made manifest and no no no birth control no no nothing will stop the seed of God from coming right apostasy when people don't know the difference between God and the devil they have gotten so blind they read the scriptures but yet is still they think it's okay in other words everybody is right in their own eyes you know guarding or God guarding or judge that they already that doesn't matter but God's Word matters everything matters right let me move on as I said this earlier sheis people right everybody got a right I got a to do what I want to do right and then you know the world has gotten rid of the Bible churches have gotten rid of the Bible you very seldom see people carry the Bible even the church but it is what it is it is the age of insanity everybody's insane couple of y'all know it's the truth now y'all know the truth and I ain't gonna hit too hard but sometimes you see these people dressed outside and you think to yourself oh they must have left their clothing at home y'all know it's too right I mean the little bit of things that they wear and they expect for a man not to look but it is a natural thing that's why sons of God must turn their heads is that right because the Bible says are calling the revelations third chapter they'll be naked and they don't even know it whew as I said is the age of perversion is the age of fake news is the age of deception hallelujah and the only thing that will span as truth is God's Word and that's the thing that everybody's saying is a lie ain't none to that Bible is old-fashioned we got to revive it oh we don't revive nothing it revives us yeah yeah oh but see it's the truth this is why what is it that Muslims Hindus whatever you name it can have their Bible books in a Christian store but we can't have ours but because they don't want truth what is it that everybody gotta have books explain in the Bible let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if there was if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you Oh what comforting words to know that we will not remain here now you got to understand this catching away on this rapture that we're talking about it is a snatching or catching away or however you want to put it it is God coming down and changing your body from moral tool immortality hallelujah and right now we are now in the process of God doing that that's why God has to show he had to sin a word so that we would know how to prepare ourselves right or they said oh we're going to be changed in a moment of twinkling and I that's right but it's because you have already come up to that point where you could be changed no sinners no no no no no the Bible says no unclean thing shall enter that City so therefore there must be a message there must be a word that God can give us to change us from unclean to clean I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also in my father's house in other words in my father's Kingdom I have many palaces that's the way it works because I want you to understand that the bride of Jesus Christ is outside of Jesus the celebrities of heaven hallelujah amen he's the number one but we fall it right there with him right but lost you got to understand the Bible said the whole heaven and earth is named after him is that right and the Bible said his new name you and I will be given think about it think about it how did God when God changed his name from Jehovah to Jesus and how that Israel called upon Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah and they didn't get nothing to this day they still are not getting it because the power is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ neither's their salvation in but there's no other name given among men whereby we must be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ being a Buddha won't do it being a Muslim won't do it you know you know you know it doesn't matter Christian science those things don't work the Bible said just shall live by faith now let me go on because you and I must realize that God has given us something and you must come to understand when God quickened his Holy Spirit in you when that was quickened now that yearning is in you more God more God more God right no matter how many times you fall no matter how much you fail you still crying out more god more god hallelujah why he put that in you you didn't derive it you didn't come by it by your own self yourself he placed that in you before the foundation of the world God was the one who switched on the switch some of us was in a club some of us was on the street we didn't know who we were like Peter James and John and all of them they didn't know who they were but then Jesus met him and when Jesus called him with what he said I knew you and you were with me before the foundation of the world that's your Bible and in Peter James John and all the rest was with him before the foundation of the world so were you why because we were in him sin what did sin do sin made us forget who we were and who we are where we came from and where we're going that's why we needed Jesus we needed somebody amen is that right let's put it this way he came out of Adam it was Adam who told Eve who she was she didn't know it but it was Adam said listen you came for me and unless you're born of my bone and flesh of my flesh and I I was here before you came you were made out of me and Jesus did the same thing we came out of him and we made all for him is that right the Bible said according to revelation in 3rd chapter he is the beginning of God's creation Alleluia and the scripture calls us what his brethren I'm coming why he's all Lord I can't hardly wait to get home but how can you call heaven your home if you never been their home it's a place that you've been there before yes and you and I must understand heaven is our home because that's where we came from jesus said I came from God and I go back to God you see only those who came from God from the beginning goes back to God it's a roundup we call it a gathering when the Feast of the trumpets but what he goes trumpet what was it doing it was literally calling people to a gathering a feast and then and the wedding supper in the sky the marriage supper excuse me is a feast that Jesus had prepared for all the redeemed that's your rapture he's oh I'm going to escape well that's true it is us in escape but when you escape is not you escaping from danger because at that point in time you have come into his very image and his likeness there's nothing can harm you but the rapture the changing of the body is to produce you with the body that can literally go through the sky through the air through the dimension because as we are flesh and blood the Bible says no flesh and blood can enter no we can't go this way God has to change this body like his own body his resurrection body y'all hear me because that's what he did when Enoch was translated you think Enoch went up to heaven in a flesh and blood body he couldn't do it you can go by so much fought so far up then you'll die from suffocation your freeze to death so he had to change his suit right and we said well Oh what about what about Elijah Elijah went up in a chariot of fire whirlwind and all did to God God had to change him is that right oh yeah because remember when he stood there on Mount Transfiguration he stood there Jesus Moses and Elijah stood there but Moses was there they say but Moses may have died but he resurrected because even the devil looked for him and couldn't find him hallelujah that's the part I like one of these days they'll look for me and I'll be gone see and we know by God's grace the glory of the Lord was done about Transfiguration who stood there Jesus only and basically was saying I'm the reason for Moses Moses was a shout and a type of me I'm the reasons for Elijah Elijah was a shattering type of me you see but he is the real one the true God nor three Tabernacles let us be a one for Moses let us be a one for Elijah that was me a one for Jesus and then unknown Jesus only ma it is God alone right now let me hurry up I'm taking too much time you and I must understand when we talk about the translation or rapture it is a in a process add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge temperance patience godly brotherly kindness right on up into divine love if you go to Peter you'll find out that is what Peter called the divine nature of God each one of those virtues that I have listed on that wall calls for battle you're battling it you're battling it's like the children of Israel who God gave that the land of Canaan and they had to kill all the Giants and if you don't kill the giant it will what about said if you don't kill and if you don't kill all the inhabitants of the land scuse me not the giant if you don't kill all the inhabitants of the land guess what they will become a thorn to your wet flesh and these virtues if you don't obtain these virtues you said all brothers I can't do it you're right you want to sit right you cannot add one cubit to your statue but there is a seed gene that God placed in you and when the preaching at the preaching of the word that see seed gene was quickened that's why you love the word I love it I love it I love it I want more of it more of it it's like a baby when it's born and give me more give me more right and as that baby eats it grows that's how it is with the word you don't have to mince our fake it eat it and the most of us are stuck in our growth because we're not reading our word we're not selling shipping we're not in there amen we're we're just laying in the presence of the Sun for God to ripen you because most of us Christians are too green yet and harvest this you know the we just golden has laid in the Sun one thing I know about the harvest time you know when it's when it's Winnett that wheat is green it stands with pride but as that Sun began to bake it it begins to brown down in prayer it drops his head that's how you know you're maturing when you learn how to pray when you start praying and stop being this and come back to this is that right because you got to realize amen that's the way a baby is born a baby stands straight in his mother's womb but when it's time for it to be born it goes into a prayer position hmm and that's the way it is at the time of this rapture ya ain't gonna be partying you're gonna be in a prayer mode yes people don't understand how powerful prayer is but when the foolish version asked give us up your oil then why I said you go pray up prayer is essential to making a rapture if you are a true bride why because you're constantly asking God for forgiveness and you're asking God for virtue you're asking God constantly lord give me patience lord give me God in His Lord give me brotherly kindness I need that Lord I need that and then as you ask God gives he anoints that spirit He pours water on the seed and it begins to grow you can't do it but the seed in you that's why the problems I said you have in that seed the potential everything you need for the rapture and what is God coming back for character what character the character of the Lord Jesus Christ and it must be in you and me right all this integrate did you know that that God is the god of the dead and the living there's coming a change and you and I realized amen that this change y'all better enjoy Jesus you know I get I can't get over these Americans and how we carry on like we're gonna have freedom of religion all for until Jesus come our country's getting ready to flip you barely enjoy these things like let the Prophet God said it's gonna be a farm memory oh I remember when brother Brooks was dancing in the spirit know you better enjoy yourself now because it ain't gonna be so easy down the road Christians are becoming less popular all the time the world don't want you anymore you in their way you remind them of their conscience they know that consciousness tell them is wrong and as a Christian you spend there as a witness to what they say they says is right you know it's wrong see that I want that they don't know because if they get rid of the Bible they don't have nothing to do to judge them or condemn them or accountability is the word I'm looking for they don't have to have accountability that all right verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live for as as a father have life in himself so have you given it to the son to have life in him and have given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man Marvel not at this for the hour is coming into which all that are in the grave share hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation two different calls the first resurrection are those who are saved and redeemed the second resurrection are those who come forth for the white throne judgment and included in that is the foolish virgins among the sinners and that's when God said he will separate the sheep from the goat hallelujah is this okay so you understand by God's grace amen that we're the original right the original is how can I say it must be proven you can't say all I am of the original no no no no no no it's like somebody you know how they doing blood tests now to see who's the father God has done a blood test he knows who the father is right so you must understand amen the blood test is what tells the doctor who you belong to that's why when you become a Christian and you become you get filled with the Holy Ghost amen what is it it is a blood transfusion that's right the Holy Ghost really is just the life that was in the blood of Jesus we don't work with the chemistry anymore it is the life that was in the blood of Jesus right because that's what the angel said to Mary Mary said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you right and you will have a son and called his name Jesus so if the Holy Ghost is Jesus father then who's the father it was the Holy Ghost that overshadowed Jesus so the Holy Ghost must be the father he is that's why people don't understand he meant that the Holy Ghost of God in Christ all it is is Lord Father Son Jesus Holy Ghost it is in the church today right three offices God as a father he created everything he came down as a son he's still the creator but he created himself a body and the Bible says in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily but the same Holy Ghost that created everything is in that body so what's the difference if ilyinka if I linked a coca-cola from a plate a drinking from a cup it still coca-cola it's just the containment is different right and the Holy Spirit is Elohim Himself the self existing wine but does it take Jesus from being a man he had to be a man because God made himself a man he's the only one that can change you hmm is this okay I said it let me hurry up we know that when the angel of the Lord when he said the Lord Himself said is sin from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we understand that all of this is still in process the voice Amen is the shout is the message that voice of the Archangel when when God came down ain't mental Lazarus and and Jesus stood there and he said I'm doing this for you not me but when he cried aloud to us come forth is that right a ladder's awakened and he came forth when Jesus was on the cross and he's kind of Father forgive them for what forgive them because they know not what they do when he scream with that loud voice the Bible says and gave up the ghost said the earth shook hallelujah what was he doing he was getting the attention of the other regions the other dimensions heard that voice is that right those that were in the grave something took place it shook amen that dimension and all of a sudden Abraham's soul and spirit came back to the dust that we was in let me tell you something and then they began to walk around read your Bible for 40 days 30 to 40 days where I was Abraham does where was Joel dust who knows where it was it doesn't matter where it was it was a resurrection that means if the wind had blown it to the four winds of the earth God had to take every piece that I saved us and bring it back together that's how God will do it I don't care for fish eat you when the resurrection comes the fish got to give it up because the resurrection means to bring back that which it which was he ain't get I'm sorry I know some of y'all might want to look a look better than all that it'll be only because it's a glorified body but you gonna still look like you my precious brother Simon Smith you know he's a little short so if I could just get a few more inches no God purposely made you short just like he make us all right amen Oh God have mercy so we realize you so how do you know because David said that when he descended and he began to us sin he approached the gates and he says open up the gates and let let the King of glory come in right y'all know the song they said who was this King of glory they said the Lord strong and mighty in battle he is this King of glory somebody help me and what happened all of the dares Saints arose but before they went into that big March well I can see him I don't know how to eat him but I I just I when we get there they could just replay it nevertheless when they got the Saints Abraham and Sarah and all of them walked around the city and everything Amen because that's what the Bible said the graves were open and many of them what they walked around people saw them I think over five hundred people saw the resurrection but where were they five hundred people became witnesses but where were they didn't show up on our Burien it they are upper room look it up five hundred people five hundred and out of all of that they get 120 in the upper room what happened to all those who seen signs and wonders of the resurrection think about it look at in America she saw signs and oneness dead raised as an a blind open all of these things and where are they now see what about the man ten lepers who was healed and only one came back to say thank you Jesus what happened to the nine you see is that's that's where we are the Bible said we're living in an age that is unthankful it's an unthankful a each the more God gives you it's just ain't enough give me more think they just not satisfied is that right you know instances that Christians have become too materialistic and we have lost our vision of why we're here we're here to make the devil know that the seed of God lives and we come to declare Jesus Christ in Satan's Eden we got to prove to him that we're not his children I was a little disappointed Sunday I thought everybody would come here hallelujah is Easter oh it didn't happen that way but you know I thought to myself I said Lord only God can get you excited and the joy of the Lord is your strength so when I don't see joy I know you're going through something but let us not lose the fire of God that he's given to us let it not just come to a simmer it must be on fire the Bible said Amen he listened is that right revelation said I would that you be hot or cold lukewarmness is a dangerous position to be in you got to be hot or you got to be cold and that right so you got to understand I'm always done for this session it understand this you and I must remember and I was telling the Lord us is Lord we've got to take our post we've got to take our stand we've got to come to this place where we where we were supposed to be right you've got to come up you can't just stay back here in the back you got to get on the front line you got to declare what you are and who you are is that right every age if a prophecy was given it manifested itself every age paul aid they manifested it all the way up Lutheran's manifested their age West man's manifested a age the pillar as manifested their age this is the word age where the whole word comes together right the Alpha and the Omega you are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh but you know what I think a lot of times people say well when I get old no no no it must be manifested in this dimension when Jesus he you got to understand that Jesus did not only declare he was the Christ what was so great about him being crucified he wasn't the only one that had ever been crucified merely before him many even on that day was crucified but the thing that made him Christ and made him Lord was that he got up there was a resurrection he said you can destroy this body I can destroy this temple in and in in three days I'll raise it up did he come up he came up Wow because in the Bible it is written in the Psalms I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I allow his flesh and men to see corruption is that right that's why this resurrection must take place is that right the Bible said if that same spirit being you that was also in Christ Jesus as it quick tan is body it will quicken yours it'll raise you up it doesn't matter how you die a an atomic explosion drown in the ocean burn to a crisp when God said come every portion of you will come back together and then what happens hallelujah whoa God crowns you see people don't understand we will get a crown but the greatest crown you and I will get from God is the glorified body that's the crown brother Balaam talked about that's the crown that glorified body whew anybody with me if I had a different body I'd be perfect but this that gives me trouble in my soul I'm right in my spirit I'm right is this get rid of this and give me a new one I'll be alright I know how you feel I know to see him I know it it's the truth I love brother mahashiv praise the Lord this this this this this see what you feeding on and what you're experiencing is it's the body word the bleeding body word of Christ it is it is it is the revelation of this power it is the revelation of this day and it can only be given to a special class of people everybody can't receive this there hear it and call it a name but for those who are truly of God it rings the bell that's that's it it's right you may not even be able to fully explain it but you know it's right listen I'm a close on this thought because I'm not done with this but I want you to understand because of the origin as we said Christ says Jesus said I came from God I go back to God right in that same way you and I must see ourselves we came from God and we go back to God hello where was Jeremiah before he was in his mother's womb he was with God Jesus even said God said I knew you Jeremiah before he was formed in your mother's womb and I sanctified you and I called you to be a prophet before the child was born that call that's what we call predestination Alleluia Jesus himself was predestinated did you know that you were predestinated God saw you coming that's why the devil wanted to kill you and he couldn't wanted to get rid of you and he could not why because God saw you here today Jesus was look how crazy it must have sounded when when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive you know the people say you know he's off his rocker now he doesn't even promise out a lot of thing but house they're messing up now even Isaiah probably thought what in the world and why did I say that could you know what he didn't have to necessarily understand what he was saying he just said what God told him to say no doubt he went through his old life not seeing that virgin come to pass but one thing Isaiah knew God spoke it and it was something that he'd never had to recant from he said I'm saying we know the wraptor or the translation of this body God is getting ready to change us why we are experiencing the change right now little by little right little by little you don't see oh all of a sudden like it's boo no no no little by little you have seen changes in your life it may not even be in the very area that you wanted to be wanting to be the most but it comes it comes because sometimes God leaves that thing that torments you the most there until he can get you where he wants you to be in other words it becomes your thorn in the flesh like Paul's thorn in the flesh God always got something in you to keep you humble you get puffed up with this revelation God said he let you drop a fall a little bit so you can look up again any good he's good he's merciful and understand because we have a perfect Savior he will bring forth a perfect people I'm a closed on this scripture 2nd Timothy 4 6 to 7 Paul says for I am now ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but unto all of them also that love his appearing who you love is appearing oh yes Lord I'm just going to closing that note we're finished the next time we come through and my thing is it this rapture there's changing of the body it's it's it's in motion it's in progress now it's it's a secret that the world has nothing knows nothing about and I say this and I said you know humble way organizations and humble are they can't tell you they don't know this and and it's in its way it's supposed to be because what in Revelation the third chapter they put Jesus out the door read it he said I stand at the door knock what else Laodicea the third chapter of Revelation is the only time that Jesus Christ is put out of his own church but there was always somebody that was going to open and God said him and he's never left himself without a witness lest an I'm just trying to encourage you keep you on the right path times are hard and we're pressing right pressing press toward the mark of a high calling this is the high calling there bill many people cram any Christian saved but all Christians won't be raptured we're working for rapturing we want rapturing faith we want that material that's going to take us up is that right Enoch was translated but Noah being a Christian had to go through the tribulation he was a type of the tribulation Saints they weren't lost but the Bible said to be cast into outer darkness and there'll be a lot of gnashing of teeth and wailing why cuz so many people are gonna say oh my god I wish I had listened why didn't I hear him why why why can you imagine what Jenna's and Jambres felt when they found themselves in the region of the loss can you imagine those ones who raised up against Moses and their earth swallowed them up and they failed into the midst of a fire think about it we have that opportunity we have one of those invitations you know Hollywood always try to mimic eight I think they call it the red carpet type thing they got all the celebrities and only those VIPs are invited see God got that too that's the real one but the only thing is the streets will be made of gold real gold transparent gold something that will not fade or break right and you and I must understand that we have been called to this great banquet in the sky it sounds like a fairy tale but come and go with me to my father's house blue to my father's house
