[26:50] [Music]
[26:58] [Music]
[27:15] [Music]
[27:20] [Music]
[27:34] [Music]
[27:41] [Music]

[29:31] [Music]
[29:39] [Music]
[29:44] [Music]
[30:11] [Music]
[30:20] that's what we want God to do amen I
[30:24] want everybody in respect to the church
[30:27] in Iowa not just to think Des Moines not
[30:32] just to think Iowa City but the Church
[30:34] of Iowa because that's what we are and I
[30:38] believe God has given us this whole
[30:39] territory not just a piece of it and so
[30:43] when we do that we understand that the
[30:45] body is not divided we're not two
[30:48] separate churches because one is in Iowa
[30:51] City or one is in Des Moines is that
[30:54] right
[30:55] the Bible tells us that we are one body
[30:57] by one spirit so you and I must
[31:00] recognize and stop beginning to think
[31:02] that way so that we won't find ourselves
[31:05] just so into this when God has so much
[31:09] of this right amen
[31:12] my it's been really on my heart to
[31:15] invite brother lunga on a preach at some
[31:18] point in time you know he was really
[31:20] gracious to us when had us dedicated
[31:22] service and and things like that but
[31:24] when we do I will definitely be present
[31:27] by God's grace but it's just been on my
[31:30] heart to reach out and and understand
[31:34] it's it's just a strain on them as much
[31:37] it is on us because a lot of them can't
[31:39] understand English and a lot of us can't
[31:42] understand French but the love of God
[31:45] compels us to unite at a time when we
[31:49] see the darkness uniting we ought to
[31:50] learn how to unite there are and like I
[31:53] said that which is not right God will
[31:56] make right is that all right but we must
[31:59] not allow ourselves to become
[32:03] denominational that's not the will of
[32:06] God now understand
[32:11] I can't we talk we call how many chances
[32:14] God has given me I'm so glad that God
[32:20] don't give up on me sometimes I give up
[32:23] on myself and God have to kind of slap
[32:25] me a little bit you know to make me wake
[32:27] up and realize that I don't have to give
[32:30] up on myself because he won't forgive up
[32:32] on us and that's what matters more than
[32:34] anything else God will not give up on us
[32:39] yes sir
[32:40] fresh from the throne brother God is so
[32:44] good to us oh he's better to us than
[32:47] we've been to ourselves we want to
[32:49] continue our service
[32:53] hopefully by God's grace we'll be able
[32:55] to complete I don't know I just know
[33:02] that God has given me something and I'm
[33:04] trying to get it over to the people of
[33:05] God and I wish that I can give it to you
[33:08] like I like it came to me all I know is
[33:12] that it has benefited me in the sense
[33:15] that I can see myself clearer now than
[33:18] ever it's something how when you
[33:21] fighting an enemy and he's behind the
[33:23] bush and you can't see him
[33:25] you know you got the right equipment to
[33:27] handle him but you can't see him because
[33:30] of the bush but once the bush has moved
[33:33] out of the way and you can see him guess
[33:35] what the great surprise was I saw who my
[33:38] self which is my greatest enemy
[33:42] it ain't Satan Satan has no power over
[33:45] the bride
[33:46] but it's ourselves that we must work
[33:49] with Saint Matthew the 3rd chapter
[34:01] 17th verse in Saint John 8 chapter 28
[34:14] this morning I was really uh I can't
[34:17] explain it but spiritually just hurting
[34:20] and then I had a lot of joy and you know
[34:24] it just was a lot of mixed emotions this
[34:26] morning but I trust by God's grace that
[34:29] you were blessed by the word I thank God
[34:32] for allowing my brother Frank to sing
[34:36] that song he was it was right on time
[34:38] it was really an encouragement to me I
[34:41] heard that you anytime we go to Iowa
[34:45] City you might want to join us so be
[34:47] careful to remind me to remind you so
[34:50] you could make the choice or whether you
[34:51] were able to or not anyone else who
[34:56] would like to go at times you're more
[34:58] than welcome
[34:59] I'll do the driving down there and you
[35:03] do the driving as we stand Matthew 3:17
[35:09] into a voice and lo a voice from heaven
[35:13] saying this is my beloved Son in whom I
[35:18] am well pleased
[35:19] say John 8:28 then said Jesus unto them
[35:25] when you have lifted up the Son of man
[35:27] then shall you know that I am he and
[35:30] that I do nothing of myself but as my
[35:34] father hath taught me I speak these
[35:37] things and he that sent me is with me
[35:41] the father hath not left me alone but I
[35:45] do always those things that please him
[35:47] as he spake these words many believed on
[35:50] him I want to say by God's grace before
[35:54] I forget when God gives you a territory
[35:57] that territory
[35:59] is yours and I believe that God has
[36:03] given this little bride in DesMoines the
[36:05] territory of Iowa I don't believe that
[36:08] God put us in the Capitol for us just to
[36:11] set in the Capitol so I'm saying this
[36:14] we have a people that I know that God
[36:17] has are called in their lives sister
[36:20] Irene marina and her group and so we got
[36:24] to not only need your prayers and your
[36:25] help because I'm gonna reach out to them
[36:27] again and by God's grace try to somehow
[36:33] get them to see the importance of this
[36:36] message they need to know I know their
[36:40] hearts they love God as much as they but
[36:42] you understand what I'm saying
[36:44] we all have our battles with our
[36:46] reasoning and self and so if we could
[36:50] get us praying and believing that that
[36:54] God will bring them in then I believe it
[36:56] will be so you love the Lord let us pray
[37:00] father God we come before you we thank
[37:02] you for your grace we thank you for your
[37:04] mercy we thank you for everything that
[37:07] you have given unto us father most of
[37:10] all I thank you for this opportunity
[37:12] Lord to see that you have been so
[37:16] gracious to us oftentimes I look at self
[37:21] and wonder how can you love such a thing
[37:25] the way you love me and and now I see a
[37:28] God it's just that see that that part of
[37:32] you that you can't help but to love and
[37:35] we thank you for imparting part of that
[37:37] life into us that in spite of all of our
[37:40] shortcomings you love and and not only
[37:43] nor you you chasing us and you correct
[37:46] us and and your bringing us into that
[37:49] perfect statue of Christ you are a
[37:51] beautiful God and you have produced a
[37:53] beautiful situation we're so happy this
[37:56] morning or this evening be part of you
[37:58] there are no words to express our
[38:01] gratitude and we just trust that you
[38:03] would give us Lord the revelation and
[38:06] understanding of how to completely die
[38:08] to ourselves every day all day that that
[38:13] the prophecies of this message may be
[38:15] fulfilled through us your bride in Jesus
[38:19] Christ's name we pray amen
[38:21] you may be seated
[38:26] you know I was saying this morning and
[38:29] I'm still willing let thy will be done
[38:32] in earth as it is in heaven
[38:34] and our theme kill the will we must
[38:38] understand by God's grace that what God
[38:41] is doing in the stage getting us to
[38:43] first of all understand who we are you
[38:47] know we often hear the the pastors and
[38:51] preachers and I have been guilty myself
[38:53] we quote brother Branham and he says
[38:56] when the bride began to see who she is
[38:58] she will become an invincible army well
[39:02] I believe that the bride is beginning to
[39:05] see who she isn't because yesterday I
[39:08] was thinking how long is it going to
[39:10] take for the bride to come to see who
[39:12] she is first of all you must understand
[39:15] that in these last days amen there was a
[39:19] call a Lynn tonight cry according to
[39:21] Matthew 25 the Bible said the five were
[39:24] wise and five were foolish now those
[39:26] five wise Brides had to know Amen who
[39:30] they were otherwise how could they have
[39:32] ever gotten into the door those who were
[39:34] foolish were late and they came to
[39:37] understand that they had an opportunity
[39:38] that they did not make because of their
[39:42] lake of I could have a late arrival upon
[39:47] the revelation on what they were called
[39:49] to be I believe those who are of the
[39:52] bride they are trying their best to trim
[39:55] their lamps they're doing everything
[39:56] they can do Amen to make that eternal
[39:59] fire burn through them and by way of
[40:02] doing that they come to know who they
[40:04] are now you say well what do you mean
[40:06] brother Brooks I'm trying to say this
[40:07] amen the light in which God has given us
[40:10] in this day this message has already
[40:13] separated us from denominationalism and
[40:16] organizational ISM and if we are
[40:18] therefore separated from organizational
[40:20] ISM and denominationalism in that it
[40:23] defines us it began to identify who we
[40:27] really are
[40:28] my point is when we come to a place and
[40:31] we've come to see who we really are we
[40:33] must know the benefits of who we are or
[40:36] what we have rather
[40:39] let's say it like this Amen God has
[40:41] promised us and he that's why I want to
[40:43] work with the word promise
[40:45] now I worked with the fact this morning
[40:48] that we've had to meet God's criteria
[40:51] but understand if God has promised and
[40:54] he has that there will be a bride in
[40:57] this day then there will be a bride is
[41:00] that right
[41:01] but it is up to you by faith to
[41:04] recognize that you are part of that bry
[41:07] right you can't continue to Alette allow
[41:11] reasoning or your own thoughts or your
[41:14] own will affect you in the sense that
[41:17] you have you are doubting God's promise
[41:20] it is like Sarah Sarah was the one who
[41:23] doubted right how can this thing be
[41:26] seeing that I have never known a man on
[41:30] excuse me Mary she didn't know a man and
[41:33] but Sarah laughed it's what I want to
[41:35] say and the promise is that God had
[41:37] promised Abraham that Sarah represents
[41:40] who you and I and we know by God's grace
[41:44] Amen that if God promised did we need
[41:48] not to laugh or look at it as it's
[41:50] impossible you got to understand Sarah
[41:53] look at her physical condition she
[41:56] looked at her spiritual condition
[41:57] whatever it was whatever made her laugh
[42:00] she looked at it it says impossible
[42:02] right if you look at your natural the
[42:07] natural man you're going to come up with
[42:10] the same conclusion it is impossible
[42:13] hallelujah but I asked the question this
[42:16] morning it is evening is there anything
[42:18] too hard for God hallelujah
[42:21] you think that you are a task if God
[42:24] could take a world that was void without
[42:26] shape without form speak the Word of God
[42:29] and then light comes and he forms as any
[42:31] shapes it and he breaks on days and
[42:33] flowers and whatever out of something
[42:36] that was dead and in chaos what do you
[42:39] think God can do for you because let me
[42:41] tell you this you were there you may not
[42:45] have been in your body as you are now
[42:48] but your elements were there
[42:50] hallelujah theirs
[42:52] no extra cents grains of sands
[42:55] hallelujah there is no extra water
[42:57] garden and no extra water he added no
[42:59] more chemicals to this world every piece
[43:02] of this world is still here and you were
[43:05] there in all of that so I want to build
[43:09] your faith because it's really simple
[43:11] it's simple
[43:13] stop thinking on your own let God think
[43:19] for you let God's choices be your
[43:22] choices right when you are in doubt of
[43:26] anything you go to God in prayer you
[43:31] always if you can keep your mind Lord I
[43:33] want to know your will for me today and
[43:36] you keep your mind on that throughout
[43:39] the day God will direct your path why
[43:42] because you have acknowledged him is
[43:45] that right acknowledge the Lord in all
[43:47] of your ways and he shall direct your
[43:50] path right so we are in a place right
[43:53] now and that's that's the way Jesus was
[43:55] that's the way brother Brandon was I
[43:57] believe all the prophets were of the
[43:59] same way it meant they wouldn't move
[44:01] until they got a direct direction from
[44:04] God and you and I need to seek that we
[44:07] need to stop even allowing Satan and I'm
[44:10] speaking to myself because I'm guilty
[44:12] allowing Satan to make us think that
[44:17] we're not in a position to do anything
[44:19] for God because let me say like this the
[44:23] Bible said that the bride of Jesus
[44:24] Christ is justified so if God has
[44:27] already justified you and the Bible said
[44:30] whom God justify he glorified so you
[44:33] understand God can use you God wants to
[44:37] use you hallelujah
[44:39] and I believe by God's grace but we make
[44:42] we must make ourselves available is that
[44:46] right
[44:47] because you and I must understand that
[44:49] that when it came to our Isaiah Isaiah
[44:53] was an unclean man he was he says not
[44:56] i'm unclean i dwelling in and among the
[44:59] people that that that are unclean lord i
[45:01] mean and here isaiah was a great prophet
[45:04] of god
[45:06] but when he came before God he
[45:08] surrendered before God because remember
[45:10] Amen he had aziah as an image but when
[45:14] as iodide as there was left to himself
[45:18] and now he realized Amen there is no
[45:21] covering for me there is nothing for me
[45:22] to hide behind and therefore I need you
[45:25] Lord so when he began to really seek the
[45:28] Lord in that way God unfair unfolds
[45:31] himself unveils himself to Isaiah and
[45:33] the Bible tells us that God took a cold
[45:36] off of the altar placed it on Isaiah
[45:39] trunk and that's when Isaiah says war
[45:41] with me Oh Lord
[45:42] and that's the next thing he goes on to
[45:45] say well Lord if you need somebody send
[45:47] me see when you know a change is taking
[45:50] place in your life and that change came
[45:53] by God not by you but one of the things
[45:56] that Isaiah wanted he had a will and he
[45:59] wanted to his will was to meet the
[46:02] Living God see because what is a prophet
[46:05] if he doesn't have God he's nothing
[46:09] right so let's look at this thing he
[46:12] said I'm saying all these things to let
[46:14] you know that here Jesus Christ who was
[46:17] a man yet God but God used him as an
[46:20] example everything that Jesus did he had
[46:23] to make a decision whether to do it or
[46:26] not
[46:26] alright he was a word the Word was with
[46:29] God the Word was God but as a man he
[46:33] still was subject to vanity is that
[46:36] right brother Adam said he got sick he
[46:38] had headaches I mean those things that
[46:40] that touches our physical RAM touched
[46:43] his physical RAM but there was not one
[46:45] time in the scriptures you find Jesus
[46:48] complaining right because he knew I mean
[46:52] everything that came to him was he's a
[46:54] trial or a test it was the will of God
[46:57] nothing could come by him a come by his
[46:59] way with our God sin in it and we must
[47:03] realize it man we're the same way we are
[47:05] the bride we cannot get out of the test
[47:08] we cannot get out of the trial and we
[47:10] can't run from it many times I have felt
[47:13] many times they long come take my life
[47:15] you know I'm tired of living hallelujah
[47:17] but all that was is a way you
[47:20] escape what you put what God is ordained
[47:22] YouTube to test to take you understand
[47:26] me
[47:26] we can't run from it and and you can't
[47:30] take your life and God you can't give it
[47:33] up until God has sent you through the
[47:37] things in which he has ordained you to
[47:40] go through see because every one of us
[47:42] need each other not one of us said alone
[47:46] in such a sense that God is just
[47:48] consistently thinking about you only
[47:51] but God thinks about his bride and he
[47:54] thinks about how she's operating how
[47:56] well she's moving into that realm that
[47:59] he's already pre predestinated for her
[48:01] right and you and I must understand and
[48:04] just what the Lord spoke to me in this
[48:05] evening on my way to church he said just
[48:08] me he said did you not know the will of
[48:10] Satan is what brought all of the
[48:12] division that's why the Bible tells us
[48:17] in Jude that if a brother bring division
[48:19] in the church he you just think he has
[48:22] the Holy Ghost but the hope because the
[48:24] Holy Ghost doesn't bring division
[48:27] hallelujah how can God tell you in John
[48:30] to love your brother even as yourself
[48:32] and then at the same time that God tells
[48:34] you to hate him despised and rejected
[48:36] whatever that spirit is not of the Lord
[48:38] it is will and it's not it's the devil's
[48:42] will not God's will right it is Satan
[48:45] who comes to steal kill and destroy but
[48:48] it's God who comes to give us life that
[48:52] we may have it more abundantly right so
[48:55] you and I must recognize and understand
[48:58] that God is not padding any of us on the
[49:01] back we have come and we are at war and
[49:04] what are we warring against all unbelief
[49:09] whether it be in you whether it be in
[49:12] your brother it doesn't matter where it
[49:14] is you and I are here to conquer all
[49:18] unbelief that right Jesus mother came
[49:22] unto him and said uh-uh know that called
[49:27] Jesus your father and I remember when
[49:30] they were add up to at the feast and
[49:32] Mary and Martha Mary she's married
[49:34] Joseph was looking for Jesus and they
[49:35] run up to Jesus and and say your father
[49:38] and I we've been looking for you
[49:40] and Jesus corrected the unbelief cuz
[49:43] that's what it was
[49:45] brother Balaam said she had forgotten
[49:47] your visitation from the angel and by
[49:50] speaking that I'm your mother this is
[49:52] your father you just denied your
[49:55] experience and the word immediately
[49:57] corrected her and says know ye not that
[50:00] I'm about my father's business
[50:02] she that's how we are he never thought
[50:06] about oh this is my mother cuz I'm sure
[50:09] that was her it's only returning
[50:12] mother's and mother and father but Jesus
[50:14] took it to the fart the level of what it
[50:16] really was because he heard he heard and
[50:21] he didn't reason with her
[50:23] he didn't even process it in his mind he
[50:27] just straightway came because a word
[50:29] will correct all error
[50:30] I am the word you are the word and you
[50:34] must believe that is that right so you
[50:37] and I must understand that Jesus did
[50:39] everything that please the father even
[50:41] if it was against friendship can you
[50:46] imagine how Peter must have felt when
[50:49] Pete when Peter said to Jesus Lord
[50:50] you're not going to die no this is not
[50:53] the way it's going to happen
[50:54] and Jesus said get behind me Satan but
[50:59] that was his friend that was a disciple
[51:01] of his but he understood he couldn't
[51:04] reason he being the word had to correct
[51:06] the error because what was Satan doing
[51:10] now he was trying to bring in a will and
[51:13] bring in a division right separating
[51:17] Christ from the word and it is our duty
[51:20] to never let mother father sister
[51:22] brother friend or whoever separate us
[51:25] from the word am I making sense because
[51:32] it is our thoughts that makes us why
[51:34] will the devil comes to steal kill and
[51:37] destroy and how does he do that
[51:40] he changes your mind like God said let
[51:43] this mind be in you that was in Christ
[51:45] Jesus a mind of OBT
[51:47] a mind of surrender a mind Amen that
[51:50] would be subject to the word on the
[51:53] under any cost right and and and if but
[51:58] Satan comes and he tried to switch that
[52:01] thing and he works with our emotions oh
[52:04] god I know I'm guilty me at times I
[52:07] never I didn't witness the people only
[52:09] because of feelings I've had people die
[52:13] on me and I wonder did I tell them
[52:16] enough anybody know what I'm talking
[52:19] about
[52:19] that's why when you ever get a chance
[52:21] you tell them everything that you can
[52:23] whether they like it or not this might
[52:26] be your only opportunity but Satan will
[52:32] make us think for the pulse it is
[52:35] because you might be giving them too
[52:37] much and you may not ever get another
[52:41] chance that's why it's so important to
[52:47] know the will of God to be in the Spirit
[52:51] of God all day right yeah not some all
[52:56] day we ought to fight to stay into the
[52:59] Spirit of God right keep him on your
[53:03] mind is that all right listen
[53:07] Deuteronomy I read that this morning he
[53:09] says 429 but if from his thou shalt seek
[53:13] the LORD thy God thou shalt find him if
[53:16] thou seek him with all thine heart and
[53:19] with all thy soul without all in
[53:21] tribulation and all these things are
[53:24] come upon thee even in the latter days
[53:26] if thou turn to the LORD thy God and
[53:29] shall be obedient unto his voice for the
[53:33] Lord that God is a merciful God he will
[53:35] not forsake thee neither destroy thee
[53:38] nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers
[53:40] which he sware unto them now you and I
[53:44] know that he told Abraham that he had an
[53:46] unconditional covenant right that
[53:49] doesn't mean we go out and we do
[53:51] whatever we want to do oh I can see it I
[53:53] could do whatever I want to do because
[53:54] grace abound there's a there's a church
[53:57] I know other just exist I'm not sure
[53:59] there now if
[54:01] Jr and they called it total grace and in
[54:03] this total grace the women can cut their
[54:05] hair and do whatever they want to but
[54:07] because they believe this message see
[54:08] the devil this message well do we
[54:13] understand it or not is the will of God
[54:18] it's not the thought of a man it is the
[54:21] will of God and we can be submissive or
[54:24] we can be stubborn stubborn this is who
[54:26] you stubbornness is the will of a man
[54:30] it's not the will of God I don't care
[54:34] who you are it is not of God that is a
[54:37] devil but the venom said it like this he
[54:39] said you can't beat a stubborn spirit
[54:42] because that's fuel to the fire I'm
[54:46] paraphrasing it
[54:47] he said beating a stubborn spirit makes
[54:49] the spirit more stubborn how can you get
[54:53] rid of a stubborn spirit only thing you
[54:55] can do is pray and fast and ask God to
[54:56] deliver because some spirit are some
[54:59] stubbornness is like other spirits
[55:01] hereditary so it's difficult some time
[55:05] to get rid of them they're really
[55:06] difficult to get rid of them
[55:08] but is there anything too hard for God I
[55:13] believe that when God saved me he came
[55:17] to clean out every devil devil scene and
[55:22] Devils unseen genetic Devils and every
[55:27] kind of hereditary devil I will not go
[55:31] to heaven with the man's gene no flesh
[55:40] and blood will enter only God's blood a
[55:46] supernatural blood y'all you mean uh-huh
[55:51] when I get to heaven there will be no
[55:53] impatience in brother Brooks see God is
[55:57] getting all that out of me now there
[56:00] will not be
[56:01] Amen ungodliness among me why God is
[56:04] getting rid all of that now oh it won't
[56:07] be long I'm in heaven and I don't have
[56:09] patience you can't you die you die
[56:12] if you didn't have pieces in heaven
[56:13] because there is no time clock see so
[56:20] God is getting all of those things out
[56:22] of me right now well what am i doing I'm
[56:26] pressing toward the mark of a high
[56:29] calling which is in Christ Jesus
[56:32] all right pressing and you know what let
[56:36] me tell you something God can't make you
[56:39] believe faith in God is something he
[56:44] gives you faith but he can't make you
[56:46] want it it is something that you desire
[56:49] if you desire God has it for you but
[56:53] faith is a gift and you know you said
[56:56] what brother Brooks walk can't listen
[56:57] every one of us brother and him said
[56:59] like this he said every one of us have
[57:01] our different measures of faith that's
[57:04] why the Bible tells us don't compare
[57:06] yourself to another man you comparing
[57:10] him yeah he's got 50% and you got 60 or
[57:13] he got 60 and you got 50 a man you could
[57:15] never be what he is and he can never be
[57:17] what you are right you look at a boulder
[57:21] a boulder is bigger than a grain of sand
[57:23] but every one of those boulders are
[57:25] built out of grains of sand I can hit
[57:28] you with a piece of grain or say a piece
[57:29] of saying they won't even feel it almost
[57:31] but let me hit you with a boulder it's
[57:34] more than is what a boulder can do for
[57:36] you is far more than what a piece of
[57:38] grain of sand can do you understand what
[57:41] I'm saying but they both made out of the
[57:43] same material if it wasn't for the
[57:46] saying the man wouldn't have a boulder
[57:49] so you know when I'm saying these things
[57:52] I want you to understand by God's grace
[57:54] we are many limit bodies we have been
[57:57] placed into the body of Jesus Christ to
[57:59] do specific things and those are the
[58:03] things that you and I need to inquire of
[58:05] God what we must do instead of trying to
[58:08] analyze how worthy we are so I will tell
[58:10] you today you're not worthy in yourself
[58:14] you are not worthy you will never be
[58:16] worthy it takes Jesus Christ to make you
[58:19] worry well how are you accepted in
[58:21] Christ not by your own deeds
[58:26] you are accepted in Christ by the deeds
[58:28] of Christ he chose you you didn't choose
[58:31] him and you and I need to wake up
[58:35] because God has great things for us I
[58:40] hope everybody's hearing and different
[58:42] ones are listening when we come about
[58:45] our will now it's up to you like I said
[58:50] this morning you have a will you can
[58:52] either serve God or serve the devil your
[58:55] will would go one or the other it will
[58:57] either go left or right right and you
[59:00] will determine that all right I had a
[59:02] sister say what do you think I'm um do
[59:06] you think I'm right because I'm still
[59:10] doing this this and this I said listen I
[59:12] said God chose you and God will change
[59:16] you in his season everything that grows
[59:23] too fast
[59:24] dies anything in the tree that comes out
[59:29] and brings in in in the spring or fall
[59:32] and winter will die everything is
[59:36] according to season and you can't change
[59:38] it so you might as well have patience
[59:40] and trust in God you understand me you
[59:44] said what what do you mean the same
[59:46] thing that's what happened to Saul Sam
[59:49] you say you stay right here till I come
[59:51] back
[59:53] hallelujah and that's what God said stay
[59:55] here till I get back
[59:56] he told his disciple stay here till I
[59:59] get back and God will tell you stay
[1:00:02] right here till I come back but you get
[1:00:04] all impatience like you're gonna be able
[1:00:06] to change yourself you can't change
[1:00:08] yourself didn't mean to do that but my
[1:00:10] point is you know it why worry about
[1:00:13] something you can't change can any man
[1:00:19] add a cubit to his statue absolutely not
[1:00:23] but you know what God wants in order to
[1:00:25] change you he wants a surrendered we'll
[1:00:28] give it to him even if you don't feel it
[1:00:32] leaving you give it to him not I give
[1:00:35] you my will if you keep saying that
[1:00:37] somewhere it's gonna
[1:00:39] strike your heart and your heart will
[1:00:41] deliver it but you gotta first confess
[1:00:45] it and believe that you're doing the
[1:00:46] right thing that's where the big tree is
[1:00:50] right in your mouth the Bible said life
[1:00:53] and death lays right in the tongue but
[1:00:55] if you don't say the lord have mercy
[1:00:56] like Nicodemus did I mean bono Mayer
[1:00:59] says lord have mercy on me God didn't
[1:01:01] even see him but he screamed it out
[1:01:04] because he knew he desired something and
[1:01:06] if God will be stopped by the voice of
[1:01:09] us of a blind man what about you just to
[1:01:15] give him healing sight what about your
[1:01:18] spiritual cycle if you really want God
[1:01:23] and you want the blessings of God you
[1:01:26] got this you got to call him from your
[1:01:28] heart you got a mean business with God
[1:01:31] and yet no half-stepping because God can
[1:01:33] see all of that whether it being neo in
[1:01:35] you right so when God is speaking amen
[1:01:40] it's it's always polite to - to listen
[1:01:43] and if you need to say Amen say Amen
[1:01:46] because I'm gonna tell you something God
[1:01:49] is pleased when you are approving his
[1:01:52] correction now we look at this thing and
[1:01:57] we must understand he says heaven and
[1:01:59] earth heaven is the Lord and and and thy
[1:02:03] God the earth also and all that therein
[1:02:06] so you know if we see God and with all
[1:02:10] of our heart and this is what I love
[1:02:12] he says circumcise therefore the
[1:02:14] foreskins of your heart and be not stiff
[1:02:17] neck hmm me all right I used to I used
[1:02:24] to a couple of my children and one in
[1:02:25] particular won't call his name but it
[1:02:27] almost didn't no good because he was
[1:02:29] born with a stubborn and you know people
[1:02:33] that they die nowadays they call it hard
[1:02:35] or you hard that means you're not gonna
[1:02:37] allow anything to affect you but I would
[1:02:40] spank my boy now I hit him I would hit
[1:02:42] him down low he just stand there so I
[1:02:45] figured out no one gonna hurt you I'm
[1:02:47] gonna hit you up so I get him in the
[1:02:49] back it didn't it
[1:02:52] it didn't faze him my whipping him did
[1:02:55] not face and trying to help him and all
[1:02:58] I whipped him for was trying to correct
[1:03:00] him but it didn't faze him because he
[1:03:02] stood there stubborn he wouldn't break
[1:03:07] he wouldn't he wouldn't allow himself to
[1:03:11] show the the part that God wants to see
[1:03:15] God wants to see you if affected
[1:03:18] emotionally God created bottles with
[1:03:23] tear bottles tear bottles and we set up
[1:03:26] here like me and we won't even break to
[1:03:28] the holy spirit and cry not one drop
[1:03:30] where did we get that from when you
[1:03:33] master your Lord the Bible said when he
[1:03:35] went down to the tomb of Lazarus he wept
[1:03:37] but somehow we allowed our society to
[1:03:41] break us to put us into a state don't
[1:03:43] you understand when tears can float that
[1:03:46] is a release that is a surrender amen of
[1:03:51] the heart unless you're just acting I
[1:03:57] love it when God allows me to break into
[1:04:00] tears because I know that even in heaven
[1:04:04] every teardrop is it's placed in a
[1:04:06] bottom one of these old days and then
[1:04:09] then used as a perfume before the Lord
[1:04:15] that she might walk worthy of the Lord
[1:04:18] and to all pleasing being fruitful in
[1:04:21] every good work and increasing in the
[1:04:23] knowledge of God strengthened with all
[1:04:26] might according to his glorious power
[1:04:27] and to all patience and long-suffering
[1:04:29] with joyfulness giving thanks unto the
[1:04:32] Father which have made us meet to be
[1:04:34] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:04:36] Saints in life who have delivered us
[1:04:38] from the power of darkness and have
[1:04:40] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:04:42] dear son he didn't say we're going to be
[1:04:45] delivered from the power of darkness the
[1:04:47] Bible said we are delivered from the
[1:04:49] power of darkness and everytime we take
[1:04:51] the darkness back we are we we are
[1:04:53] destroying the work that God has already
[1:04:55] done Paul said I'm not going backwards
[1:04:58] I'm not going to rebuild Amen the thing
[1:05:01] that I have torn down
[1:05:05] and God is torn down the laws that kept
[1:05:09] us in bondage
[1:05:10] right now amen we have one law and that
[1:05:13] law is love hello that's the law God is
[1:05:19] working with the bride now it's not
[1:05:21] touch not taste not handle not it is the
[1:05:24] l.o.v.e your prophesied that who is my
[1:05:29] prophet as well are we so busy a minute
[1:05:33] looking at this and looking at that and
[1:05:34] we missed the whole picture
[1:05:36] we can't even love one another because
[1:05:38] somebody's wearing a different color
[1:05:39] shark and you don't agree with the shirt
[1:05:42] that's what people are doing you
[1:05:51] understand me
[1:05:52] we patty we look at these things that we
[1:05:56] are not to be looking at we need to see
[1:05:58] how much God is developing in that
[1:06:00] individual and guess what then we need
[1:06:04] to help each other
[1:06:05] oh yes the Bobby said you don't even
[1:06:08] have the Holy Ghost if you can't love
[1:06:10] your brother I don't care how much you
[1:06:14] show all these sides and everything else
[1:06:16] he said it ain't there why because
[1:06:20] Satan's wisdom his his will brought not
[1:06:26] only division but brought in hatred
[1:06:29] because he had a right to hate huh he
[1:06:34] said what do you mean look what it did
[1:06:36] here it was those two boys Cain and Abel
[1:06:39] they were just sacrifice under God
[1:06:40] brothers come out of the same womb maybe
[1:06:45] a few minutes apart from one another but
[1:06:48] all of a sudden Satan manifests his will
[1:06:52] in his son and that is he wanted to be
[1:06:56] number one and what happens he kills his
[1:07:02] brother to make sure he's number one I
[1:07:05] don't have no competition did you know
[1:07:07] that
[1:07:07] and that's exactly what Lucifer trying
[1:07:10] to do and he's tried throughout the ages
[1:07:12] and that was and here's two kills God's
[1:07:14] influence so that he could be number one
[1:07:17] and right
[1:07:18] now in this age Lucifer is number one
[1:07:23] this is Satan's Eden and now he's killed
[1:07:27] the effect of Jesus Christ almost even
[1:07:31] among the believers because they have
[1:07:33] willed they meant to follow his
[1:07:36] instructions
[1:07:37] more so than God's instructions we ought
[1:07:40] to be sacrificed we ought to be
[1:07:44] crucified is that right Paul said I'm
[1:07:48] crucified with Christ nevertheless not I
[1:07:51] will not my will not my will not my will
[1:07:54] let it walk on you let them Trump you
[1:07:57] whatever they've got to do as long as
[1:07:59] you know that you are in the will of God
[1:08:01] oh you got a right that's right and God
[1:08:07] will never take that right from you but
[1:08:09] God is far more pleased when you give up
[1:08:11] your right for his right can you imagine
[1:08:16] the lord of heaven it meant being
[1:08:18] persecuted stripped and beaten and the
[1:08:22] scripture says he was dumb and opened
[1:08:25] not his mouth
[1:08:27] hallelujah can you imagine what he went
[1:08:30] through and he did it all for you and I
[1:08:33] and if Christ could keep his mouth shut
[1:08:36] during persecution so can we why because
[1:08:42] you were there if you were in Christ you
[1:08:45] have the same ability that he has he was
[1:08:51] able to ignore all of the negative
[1:08:54] things said about him
[1:08:55] ah he had one thing in mind and that was
[1:09:00] you and I 1 breaking him he had broken
[1:09:05] one part of that word it would been
[1:09:06] finished but he kept the word because he
[1:09:12] was a family man he realized that if he
[1:09:15] broke the word if he was to ever have
[1:09:18] children they would break the word to
[1:09:22] y'all understand me
[1:09:24] see because he was the original and
[1:09:26] whatever he would do would was all all
[1:09:29] lined in his DNA
[1:09:32] that's why we could never go back to
[1:09:33] where we used to be because when Adam
[1:09:35] broke it it literally broke the DNA
[1:09:41] where Adam was weak
[1:09:43] we were weak right you are the strength
[1:09:47] of the tree in which you came from
[1:09:50] that's why we must be born again
[1:09:53] we must come from the tree of life in
[1:09:56] order to stand in these last and evil
[1:09:58] days in that tree of life is Jesus
[1:10:01] Christ hallelujah
[1:10:03] like they oh they say the fruit doesn't
[1:10:06] fall too far from the tree I don't mind
[1:10:09] as long as I came from that tree
[1:10:17] we've been ordained ordained this is our
[1:10:23] inheritance and I'm not gonna let I
[1:10:25] totaled evidence this morning and last
[1:10:27] night I said I'm not gonna let you take
[1:10:29] my inheritance away from me we can't be
[1:10:33] taken well Jacob took Esau you
[1:10:38] understand me but my point is this this
[1:10:40] is mine God gave it to me he gave it to
[1:10:44] you and he expects you to reverence and
[1:10:47] respect what he's given to you hmm oh
[1:10:52] yes you know when he told you Israel he
[1:10:55] said Israel I want you to go and over
[1:10:57] the over the in Canaan and I wanted you
[1:10:59] to conquer the land he said no but if
[1:11:02] you don't conquer it he's dead he's
[1:11:04] saying Devils or will become thorns in
[1:11:07] your flesh right now the Philistines are
[1:11:12] thorns in the flesh of Israel we call
[1:11:17] them Palestinians the same tribe of
[1:11:21] people that they did not kill and get
[1:11:23] rid of are now their thorns and the same
[1:11:28] demons that we know we possess if we
[1:11:31] don't get before God to get rid of them
[1:11:33] they will always be thorns in your flesh
[1:11:35] every time you think you have come to a
[1:11:38] height or level in Christ that devil
[1:11:41] will come and slap you down every time
[1:11:46] it's true the chain is as strong as his
[1:11:53] weakest link Paul said I die daily that
[1:12:05] all right oh my he said don't be
[1:12:09] deceived and a lot of time we are he
[1:12:12] said but don't be the seed Eva
[1:12:13] communication corrupts Miss Manners you
[1:12:17] hang around corruptible people you will
[1:12:19] soon be corrupted hello
[1:12:24] oh but these are my friends what are
[1:12:26] your friends burying what kind of devils
[1:12:28] and demons they bring into your house
[1:12:32] and you better understand by God's grace
[1:12:35] your demons can be transmitted just by
[1:12:38] with the handshake or giving up
[1:12:40] something this or that email I've seen
[1:12:42] it I've experienced it it is okay this
[1:12:47] age requires one thing we're not an
[1:12:50] organization we're not a denomination we
[1:12:53] are Jesus Christ we are the body of
[1:12:57] Jesus Christ and that's all God wants to
[1:13:00] see who oh I got a quote just hold up
[1:13:05] because I'm gonna tell you something the
[1:13:07] only way we can become Jesus Christ we
[1:13:08] got to be born of God right the Prophet
[1:13:12] God said when we're born again we right
[1:13:13] there at faith hmm I heard him just the
[1:13:17] other day he said we're not in Laodicea
[1:13:19] he said we are in Ephesus again you know
[1:13:22] what Ephesus mean Ephesus is the promise
[1:13:26] it is the promise of not only the Holy
[1:13:29] Ghost but a full maturity in Christ it
[1:13:31] is the Caleb's mountain hallelujah so
[1:13:36] you and I must understand we are in the
[1:13:38] Ephesus a we're no longer and what was
[1:13:40] Ephesus emphasis was not only faith but
[1:13:42] Ephesus was love - he said how can it be
[1:13:46] love because remember when the church
[1:13:47] started the Bible said they sold
[1:13:49] everything and they distribute it to
[1:13:52] everybody so nobody would have a need
[1:13:55] that's love
[1:13:59] smitten out of laodicea back into the
[1:14:02] eighth day and people don't want to even
[1:14:04] believe that but it's true Christ is to
[1:14:08] be seen in this church not your
[1:14:11] personality not mine
[1:14:13] well that's right you say well prove
[1:14:17] that the Bible said he meant that on now
[1:14:19] Transfiguration there was Moses and
[1:14:21] Elijah and said here Peter says all let
[1:14:24] us make three Tabernacles amen
[1:14:26] so we can worship them and they said
[1:14:28] next thing they look around they saw one
[1:14:30] and that was Jesus Christ only oh I got
[1:14:33] a quote here where the velum said they
[1:14:34] went a lot when the properties move off
[1:14:36] the scene he said it was a pole it's
[1:14:38] supposed to be Jesus only and we realize
[1:14:43] it when we're not of Jesus only but he
[1:14:44] is to be glorified that's why that third
[1:14:47] pull hit man is not about man is not
[1:14:50] about even william branham he stood off
[1:14:52] on the side seeing these things happen
[1:14:55] and I really believe that when he said I
[1:14:58] ride this try this trail again he wasn't
[1:15:01] talking about himself
[1:15:03] that was God speaking through the man
[1:15:05] God will ride this trail again but when
[1:15:09] he does it won't be no personalities it
[1:15:12] can't be the only personality it will be
[1:15:15] is Jesus Christ himself there won't be
[1:15:19] another eighth angel if there is ain't
[1:15:22] eighth angel is Jesus Christ himself
[1:15:27] forgive my voice I ate a few breath
[1:15:29] mints and it just turned my voice but
[1:15:35] you know I look at this thing you know I
[1:15:36] want us to see people you that you it
[1:15:39] it's not a one-man ministry anymore
[1:15:42] you're the bride of Jesus Christ if the
[1:15:45] world is going to see Jesus Christ again
[1:15:48] it will be through you that's why it's
[1:15:52] so important look at what people are
[1:15:56] doing what the Spirit is doing because
[1:15:57] of people's reasoning they're directing
[1:16:00] people back to the Prophet if they're
[1:16:01] not directing them back to the Prophet
[1:16:03] in the sense that now amen they they do
[1:16:05] away with the ministry that's nonsense
[1:16:07] that's Antichrist and if they're not
[1:16:12] doing it there's a friend
[1:16:13] my I preach that is judge many times
[1:16:15] there in in South Africa
[1:16:18] and I saw on the internet the other day
[1:16:20] it meant they didn't they don't the man
[1:16:22] got thousands in his church started off
[1:16:24] with this message and now they got a big
[1:16:27] old bus with his figure his face and
[1:16:29] everything on it and they calling him
[1:16:30] Elohim nonsense that's blasphemy and
[1:16:39] people well I want you to understand
[1:16:41] that this is really but I'm being led to
[1:16:43] say it read your Bible
[1:16:49] you got to understand there was a lot of
[1:16:52] prophets children who didn't make it and
[1:16:57] because their prophets children doesn't
[1:16:59] make them holy I'm in the scripture
[1:17:05] where we have we were we were
[1:17:06] commissioned to follow children and I
[1:17:11] strayed this not discrediting I've got
[1:17:13] these people of my friends but you've
[1:17:15] got to keep your eyes on Jesus you can't
[1:17:19] turn from him why because the day of man
[1:17:22] is over this is God's day this is the
[1:17:25] Lord's Day we've actually moved out
[1:17:27] earlier this year we enter into what we
[1:17:29] call an eternal age there's only one
[1:17:33] setting on the throne and that's Jesus
[1:17:36] Christ he's the only one and don't get
[1:17:40] me wrong we're not to forget everything
[1:17:42] Malachi said we supposed to remember
[1:17:44] because remember when Joshua came on the
[1:17:46] scene he said God told Joshua remember
[1:17:49] everything Moses said that's your key
[1:17:53] because Moses didn't preach his word he
[1:17:56] preached the Word of God I don't know
[1:17:59] why I'm here but I'm here now it's not
[1:18:02] even in my notes but my point is you and
[1:18:04] I must understand you're married to the
[1:18:06] Lord Jesus Christ and when you married
[1:18:09] to the Lord Jesus Christ he is your
[1:18:11] headship and you're supposed to
[1:18:13] communicate with him
[1:18:20] I love the people of God and you know
[1:18:22] what I can't tell you what I see only
[1:18:25] God gives us revelation but I could tell
[1:18:29] you one thing I know I've been sent by
[1:18:32] God I understand it the judgment and I
[1:18:38] know how they give an account for
[1:18:39] everything I say he but I'm going to
[1:18:43] tell you something you better fall in
[1:18:44] love with Jesus Christ you better come
[1:18:47] to a place where you listening for his
[1:18:48] voice every day coming from the message
[1:18:58] what is the Holy Ghost prophet God said
[1:19:01] the Spirit of God has worked under
[1:19:03] justification under Luther
[1:19:05] sanctification on the West day the
[1:19:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[1:19:09] Pentecost and here it is the last day
[1:19:11] performing and doing the very same
[1:19:13] things that it did when it was in Christ
[1:19:15] what is it the church and Christ has
[1:19:18] become one and as soon as they connect
[1:19:21] together that lastly she she'll go
[1:19:25] through the sky shouting up with one up
[1:19:30] will come Wesley Luther and all the rest
[1:19:33] of them back in those days there he that
[1:19:36] first would be last and he that last
[1:19:39] would be first and they will come they
[1:19:41] will come the resurrection we're at the
[1:19:45] end time listen that's what the Holy
[1:19:47] Ghost does the Holy Ghost by
[1:19:49] justification sees just a little shadow
[1:19:52] of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a
[1:19:54] little deeper shadow of it the Holy
[1:19:57] Ghost by the baptism of it is a deeper
[1:20:00] shadow now the Holy Ghost by the
[1:20:02] restoration of it's very person being in
[1:20:06] here for me signs and wonders like he
[1:20:09] did at the beginning
[1:20:11] hallelujah going back to Peter that we
[1:20:13] are now partakers of his divine nature
[1:20:17] so God is now restoring us to the very
[1:20:20] person each age got a piece of Christ
[1:20:23] but in this age we must have the full
[1:20:26] measure Laura Beamer
[1:20:31] to us is that right
[1:20:36] he's at glory going to call me Holy
[1:20:39] Roller anyhow you might as well get
[1:20:41] started he said listen in the message
[1:20:44] Amen why are people talked about he said
[1:20:47] let him hide himself and let him loose
[1:20:51] let me lose myself and find it Lord in
[1:20:55] thee let all self be crucified let my
[1:21:00] neighbor's gossip let all this that or
[1:21:02] the other
[1:21:03] begone I go to church for one thing and
[1:21:06] that's to stay in the presence I am
[1:21:09] moved in their Lord
[1:21:11] I never desire to leave it again I'll
[1:21:14] trust your word what you say there is
[1:21:17] where I want to be drop the veils around
[1:21:20] me Lord that I could only see Jesus only
[1:21:23] and live and walk and die in him there
[1:21:27] you are
[1:21:27] on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus
[1:21:30] stood transfigured before the apostles
[1:21:33] when they looked up they seen Jesus only
[1:21:37] they said they'd seen Jesus only
[1:21:40] standing there
[1:21:41] oh god hide me in that place hide me
[1:21:45] over in that place where other veils
[1:21:48] will drop and I'll see nothing but Jesus
[1:21:51] himself I don't want to hear the from
[1:21:54] that net fantasticks of the world I
[1:21:56] don't care whether they got atomic bombs
[1:21:59] whether they got a jet plane whether the
[1:22:01] news new Cadillac's look better than the
[1:22:04] Buicks all of it doesn't matter the
[1:22:06] thing of it is I'm walking and living in
[1:22:10] Christ daily and I've died to self and
[1:22:13] the veils are dropped around hallelujah
[1:22:16] and I am in he and he in me hallelujah
[1:22:20] now you and I must understand these
[1:22:23] words are not just something that we're
[1:22:25] going to just drop to the ground he God
[1:22:27] is an inspector for the Benham says now
[1:22:29] notice but in this the Holy Ghost is a
[1:22:32] sign the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a
[1:22:35] sign that God gave to his chosen
[1:22:37] children children to jury to rejected is
[1:22:40] to be cut off from the people and to
[1:22:43] receive it is to be
[1:22:44] finished with the world and all the
[1:22:46] things of the world and to be a product
[1:22:49] that God has put a seal of approval on I
[1:22:53] used to work on a rail room out here
[1:22:56] with Harry Walter berry
[1:22:58] and we would go down onto loaded car my
[1:23:01] brother dark standing back there helps
[1:23:03] me load cars when a car is being loaded
[1:23:06] they go through the car that car the
[1:23:09] inspector and if he finds anything loose
[1:23:11] where it would fall and break or
[1:23:14] anything that would destroy he'll not
[1:23:16] seal that car until that car is so
[1:23:19] completely packed until it's so packed
[1:23:22] down and so in order that the shaking of
[1:23:25] the ride won't bother the product that's
[1:23:27] on the inside that's what the matter we
[1:23:31] don't get sealed so much we're too loose
[1:23:35] about things when the inspector goes
[1:23:37] through to inspect your life to see if
[1:23:40] you're not just a little loose about
[1:23:42] things a little loose about your prayer
[1:23:44] life little loose about your temper
[1:23:46] little loose about your tongue to talk
[1:23:48] about others he'll never seal the car
[1:23:51] some dirty habit some vile thing some
[1:23:55] vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but
[1:23:59] when he found everything is in its place
[1:24:01] in its inspector then he seals it dare
[1:24:05] be anybody open the seal until that car
[1:24:09] has reached its destiny to wear is
[1:24:11] sealed for there it is touch not my
[1:24:14] anointed do my prophets no harm for I
[1:24:18] say unto you it is better for you that a
[1:24:20] millstone has hang at your neck and you
[1:24:23] were drowned in the depths of the sea
[1:24:25] than to ever try to a fin or shake a
[1:24:28] little little on the least of these
[1:24:30] that's been sealed you see what it means
[1:24:33] that's what the Holy Spirit is is your
[1:24:36] assurance is your protector it's your
[1:24:39] witness it's your seal it's your sign
[1:24:42] that see I'm heaven bound don't care
[1:24:46] what the devil says I'm heaven bound why
[1:24:49] he sealed me he gave it to me he sealed
[1:24:53] me into his kingdom
[1:24:54] and I'm glory bound let the winds blow
[1:24:57] let's say to do what he wants to do God
[1:25:00] has done seal me till the day of my
[1:25:03] Redemption hey man that's what the Holy
[1:25:05] Ghost is oh you should want it I
[1:25:09] couldn't go on without it so must so
[1:25:13] much could be said there but I'm sure
[1:25:15] you know what I'm speaking of now also
[1:25:18] let us turn to John 14 just a minute I
[1:25:21] trust love I just love the word it's the
[1:25:25] truth now the Spirit of God the Holy
[1:25:28] Ghost what is it what is the Holy Ghost
[1:25:31] it is the Spirit of Christ in you now
[1:25:35] before we read I just like to say a few
[1:25:37] comments words here what is the Holy
[1:25:39] Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost
[1:25:42] it's a covenant what is the Holy Ghost
[1:25:44] it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:46] its spirit of Jesus Christ in you a
[1:25:49] little while said Jesus and the world
[1:25:51] what world sees me no more yet you shall
[1:25:55] see me for I will be with you even in
[1:25:59] you to the end of the world Spirit of
[1:26:01] God in His Church is that Alright see
[1:26:05] our desires our desires are to be the
[1:26:07] bride's desire and that desire is I want
[1:26:10] to please him hallelujah but not the
[1:26:14] desire of Esther I want to please me
[1:26:16] tell me what pleases the king martyr
[1:26:19] Chaya that's why I want to know what
[1:26:21] pleases the king so I can act upon it is
[1:26:24] that right now here's another quote
[1:26:26] coming from is the rising of the Sun he
[1:26:29] says now look at Transfiguration we was
[1:26:32] everyone pre-death up represented there
[1:26:35] there was a living Saints that had
[1:26:37] rapture there was a larger standing
[1:26:40] there there and there stood Moses the
[1:26:42] dead Saints represented also but both of
[1:26:45] them had quickening power whether one
[1:26:47] died or the other one didn't die they
[1:26:50] are they are there notice oh look what
[1:26:53] we are now seeing in these last days the
[1:26:56] same thing that he promised certainly
[1:26:58] people say you claim to have power no no
[1:27:01] no we're just like them on Mount
[1:27:04] Transfiguration see certainly we do not
[1:27:07] claim power
[1:27:08] like they was on Mount Transfiguration
[1:27:11] they wasn't saying Moses say see why
[1:27:16] right let me see he says on Mount
[1:27:19] Transfiguration they wasn't saying Moses
[1:27:22] say see who see who I am right the
[1:27:26] disciple says see Who I am
[1:27:28] see who I am no no no no Moses wasn't
[1:27:31] there Elijah wasn't there to try for you
[1:27:34] to identify him see Who I am
[1:27:36] oh sure we're not here in the bride of
[1:27:38] Jesus Christ so people can see who we
[1:27:40] are we're not promoting ourselves if
[1:27:44] you're promoting yourself that's the
[1:27:46] fluence of Lucifer that's the influence
[1:27:49] of the denomination of preachers my
[1:27:51] ministry you got no ministry the only
[1:27:55] ministry we have is the Ministry of our
[1:27:57] Lord Jesus Christ working through us
[1:28:00] hallelujah
[1:28:02] oh my god she noticed they seen Jesus
[1:28:06] glorified that's all they wanted to see
[1:28:10] represented Jesus glorified and so is it
[1:28:14] today we don't try to be some big person
[1:28:17] we don't care what the people say about
[1:28:19] us our names
[1:28:20] ain't nothing is his name our life it's
[1:28:23] nothing it is his life it's his power
[1:28:26] not our power and there's only one thing
[1:28:29] that we'd love to do is see him
[1:28:31] glorified and how can it be when he's
[1:28:34] glorified in us by the resurrection
[1:28:36] that's in us we see him represented
[1:28:39] again as he was today oh I love my
[1:28:42] prophet I love that my prophet that's
[1:28:44] what makes me know that he was a prophet
[1:28:46] cuz he never glorified himself he always
[1:28:49] glorified Jesus Christ he tell people I
[1:28:53] can't heal you if I could do this I
[1:28:57] would do this but I gotta wait on him Oh
[1:28:59] can't you do this let's approach him in
[1:29:01] prayer and see what he says we the one
[1:29:05] turn this thing around
[1:29:07] ah because Satan will need to be so
[1:29:10] because he knew that if we turned around
[1:29:13] and worship the Prophet we made him an
[1:29:15] idol and we became idolaters
[1:29:21] did you get that see our desires not to
[1:29:25] be glorified our desire is not some big
[1:29:28] name our desire is not boost some church
[1:29:31] or make some more in Sunday school or
[1:29:33] try to bring in how hog-tied push in
[1:29:37] offer a picnic party or bring stars
[1:29:39] buttons and something else like that
[1:29:42] that's not our desire our desire is to
[1:29:45] see him glorify glorified what not with
[1:29:48] self pride but in us our lives to prove
[1:29:52] he's alive and living in us hallelujah
[1:29:55] can I get another one here coming from
[1:29:57] the Easter seal he said but we do one
[1:30:00] thing when they looked around with all
[1:30:03] this power upon them they saw Jesus only
[1:30:06] and the real true believer don't care
[1:30:10] whether he's backing up a denomination
[1:30:12] or nothing about it he doesn't care
[1:30:14] about those things he only wants one
[1:30:17] thing for you to see that glorified
[1:30:19] Christ makes difference a real true
[1:30:23] listen a real true Mount Transfiguration
[1:30:27] experience only glorifies Jesus Christ
[1:30:31] it didn't glorify Moses it didn't
[1:30:34] glorify Elijah it didn't glorify
[1:30:37] themselves
[1:30:38] it didn't glorify nothing else but they
[1:30:41] seen the glorified Christ and in true
[1:30:45] believers that's what's in his heart to
[1:30:48] glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's
[1:30:51] trying to get to the people to see
[1:30:56] Easter seal 1965 4:10 go listen my last
[1:31:04] quote see this is what I'm saying cheap
[1:31:08] things if we're not careful we allow our
[1:31:11] flesh to be puffed up and when we do you
[1:31:13] see that's why I ran I've always ran
[1:31:15] from popularity people make me popular I
[1:31:17] run from that stuff because I know how
[1:31:19] her brother branham say brother Graham
[1:31:21] said it like this he said if the people
[1:31:24] to push you a prideful you make you and
[1:31:26] when you sell what they doin even build
[1:31:29] you up to pride he said God is a jealous
[1:31:31] God he'll make you fall
[1:31:35] oh come on somebody I've seen people in
[1:31:40] this message worship ministers worship
[1:31:44] and the minister just take it ain't
[1:31:47] nothing great about us yeah everybody
[1:31:50] like compliments but you always should
[1:31:52] always bring Jesus in it ha thank you
[1:31:55] but if working for the Lord Jesus I
[1:31:56] wouldn't be nothing you just said it
[1:31:59] like that and you just you don't say it
[1:32:01] that way and you just accept all that
[1:32:02] you know what's going to happen you're
[1:32:04] gonna get all pumped up and prideful and
[1:32:06] now you're gonna ruin the anointing we
[1:32:15] find that on their camp
[1:32:17] where this great occasion took place up
[1:32:20] on Mount Transfiguration as Peter later
[1:32:22] called it the holy mountain where he met
[1:32:25] with them now I do not believe the
[1:32:28] Apostle meant that the mountain was holy
[1:32:30] he meant it was a holy God on the
[1:32:34] mountain it isn't the body Holy Church
[1:32:37] it's not the holy people it's not it's
[1:32:40] it's the Holy Ghost in the people the
[1:32:43] Holy Ghost is holy he is your director
[1:32:47] and your leader and we find on this
[1:32:51] little camp up on Mount Transfiguration
[1:32:53] when they were commissioned to here the
[1:32:56] only thing they were commissioned to do
[1:32:58] was to hear the word only thing they
[1:33:01] seen was not a Creed they'd never seen
[1:33:04] nothing else but Jesus and he is the
[1:33:06] word made flesh and if you're gonna cut
[1:33:13] these quotes out you might as well cut
[1:33:14] all of them out these quotes were given
[1:33:18] to us after the seal and you know I look
[1:33:22] at this thing and I'm saying it's up to
[1:33:25] you like I said this morning is simple
[1:33:27] you make the choice your will versus
[1:33:31] God's will and I don't know about you
[1:33:34] but I choose Jesus whatever god has to
[1:33:38] do to me to kill and destroy every piece
[1:33:41] of my will I'm saying to you Lord in the
[1:33:44] witness of all these people so let it be
[1:33:49] I have no desire to be anything but what
[1:33:54] God wants me to be and whatever it takes
[1:34:00] I'm trusting that he'd keep me from
[1:34:03] being stubborn
[1:34:05] because all of us have a have their
[1:34:08] possible you know stubbornness can fall
[1:34:10] on anybody I don't want to be stubborn I
[1:34:13] trust that when the word comes to me to
[1:34:16] correct me that I will humble myself and
[1:34:19] let God's will be done in my life when
[1:34:24] God tells me to run I want to run hmm my
[1:34:32] point is people if you don't put your
[1:34:34] life in God's hands totally his hands
[1:34:37] you gonna come up with shipwreck only
[1:34:40] God can lead you properly you are sheep
[1:34:43] like and you cannot lead yourself you
[1:34:46] need a shepherd this is why God brought
[1:34:49] to me this morning
[1:34:51] Psalms 23rd 23rd Psalm the Lord is my
[1:34:56] shepherd I shall not want
[1:34:58] right he is the one that's leading me
[1:35:00] through the valley through the shadows
[1:35:02] of death he's meeting me he's the one
[1:35:05] that's directed me he's the one that
[1:35:07] leads me by the still waters and the
[1:35:10] green pasture don't know what that mean
[1:35:11] that means a good old revelation
[1:35:13] he's the one I don't know how to find it
[1:35:17] but he knows where the pastures are
[1:35:19] hallelujah and the brother told me in
[1:35:21] closing he said he'd been there where
[1:35:23] they lead the Sheep he said you think
[1:35:25] you know you have all these pastures and
[1:35:27] everything he said no he said sometimes
[1:35:29] you got to go through a lot of rough
[1:35:30] terrain a lot of rough territory you got
[1:35:33] to go through some some some some ways
[1:35:36] like two big stones rocks here and you
[1:35:38] got a you don't even that's why they
[1:35:40] knew that the thieves would be waiting
[1:35:42] on the other side just to rob you he
[1:35:44] said but you have to go through there
[1:35:45] with that Shepherd trusting I mean a
[1:35:48] bear or any kind of animal could be
[1:35:50] right there waiting just to devour
[1:35:52] but that Shepherd is there to protect
[1:35:54] you I'd rather have a shepherd I'd
[1:35:58] rather have him leading me
[1:36:00] I'd rather say Lord I take your
[1:36:03] not my own right I hope something came
[1:36:09] through I just know one thing it is so
[1:36:12] simple and everybody deals with their
[1:36:16] will every day all day is that when we
[1:36:22] come to those things that you and I know
[1:36:23] that's not Scripture we need to go into
[1:36:27] prayer especially if you feel that there
[1:36:28] is no strength Lord I'd be done is that
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:34] because Jesus as a man knew he couldn't
[1:36:36] do it on his own
[1:36:37] per se Lord not my will but then the
[1:36:42] Lord sent an angel and strengthened you
[1:36:45] so you want God to strengthen you in
[1:36:48] those areas that you weaken you need to
[1:36:51] say Lord not my will but time he does
[1:36:53] best in here
