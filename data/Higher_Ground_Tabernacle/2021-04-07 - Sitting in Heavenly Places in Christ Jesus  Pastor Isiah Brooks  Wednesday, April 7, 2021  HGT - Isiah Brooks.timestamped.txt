[46:14] this
[46:18] yes sir one of these old days we're
[46:20] going to
[46:21] put away this old sinful flesh
[46:24] and the real man that's made out of the
[46:28] image of christ
[46:30] we'll spend eternity enjoying him
[46:37] as i said we're coming from first john
[46:39] the first chapter
[46:42] we're going to read the
[46:46] fifth verse beginning there at the fifth
[46:48] verse and read down
[46:49] to the tenth verse
[46:52] this then is the message which we have
[46:55] heard
[46:56] of him and declared unto you
[46:59] that god is light and in him
[47:03] is no darkness at all
[47:06] if we say we have fellowship with him
[47:09] and walk in darkness we lie
[47:12] and do not the truth but if we walk
[47:16] in the light as he is in the light
[47:19] we have fellowship one with another and
[47:22] the blood of jesus christ
[47:24] his son cleanses us from all sin
[47:28] if we say that we have no sin
[47:32] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[47:34] not in us
[47:36] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[47:39] and just to forgive us
[47:41] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[47:44] unrighteousness if we
[47:47] say that we have not sinned
[47:51] we make him a liar and his word
[47:55] is not in us
[47:58] one more passage of scripture
[48:07] let's just go let me see where i want to
[48:09] go here
[48:11] hallelujah
[48:19] let's just go to ephesians please
[48:26] ephesians 1.
[48:36] we'll be gone for about 10 days and
[48:39] we're trusting that you keep us in your
[48:42] prayers and we will definitely keep you
[48:44] all in ours ephesians 1
[48:48] 3 brother troy would be
[48:51] handling the ministerial part of this
[48:54] services
[48:55] he uh and we talked to him about that
[48:58] and so
[48:59] i pray that everybody will cooperate
[49:01] with him
[49:03] in our absence ephesians 1
[49:07] beginning at the third verse blessed be
[49:11] the god
[49:11] and father of our lord jesus christ
[49:14] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[49:17] blessings
[49:19] in heavenly places in christ
[49:23] according according as he have chosen
[49:27] us in him before the foundation of the
[49:29] world
[49:31] that we should be holy and without blame
[49:33] before him
[49:34] in love having predestinated us
[49:37] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[49:40] christ himself
[49:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[49:44] will
[49:46] hallelujah you love that
[49:50] so let us thank god for his grace by way
[49:53] of prayer
[49:54] father we thank you for your grace and
[49:56] your mercy we thank you for being
[49:58] so good to us lord we thank you for this
[50:01] time and opportunity to preach your word
[50:04] we ask oh god that you forgive us of all
[50:06] our sins cleanse us from all of our
[50:08] unrighteousness
[50:09] all of our sins all of our thoughts
[50:11] desires that have not been pleasing in
[50:13] thy sight
[50:14] father we pray that you wash us clean
[50:17] because we're guilty lord
[50:19] when you say oh just if we break one of
[50:21] the law
[50:22] we're guilty of the whole and father we
[50:25] are your sinners saved by grace but
[50:28] because of that
[50:29] you have done a great work in us uh
[50:33] and we thank god thank you for that lord
[50:36] that you would take
[50:37] such a worm as i and do something great
[50:40] by making us sons and daughters of god
[50:43] bless us now in this
[50:45] your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[50:48] amen
[50:49] you may be seated i like to entitle this
[50:53] message
[50:56] sitting in heavenly places
[50:59] in christ jesus now remember we have
[51:02] been dealing with
[51:05] elevating ourselves our minds letting
[51:08] the mind of christ
[51:09] be in us stop thinking like men and stop
[51:12] thinking like failures when we
[51:16] look at ourselves as being failures then
[51:18] we're denying the grace of god
[51:21] because paul said that we are more than
[51:23] conquerors
[51:24] through christ jesus i think the most
[51:27] difficult thing for us to do
[51:30] uh sometime is to reject the lies of the
[51:33] devil
[51:34] it is satan who is contrary to the word
[51:37] now whenever the word speaks anything it
[51:40] is so
[51:41] and it has nothing to do with you you
[51:43] know you didn't choose god
[51:45] god chose you is that right
[51:48] and we understand by the message of
[51:50] today that we are under what we call an
[51:52] unconditional covenant
[51:54] it ought to make every man shout and
[51:57] jump for joy
[51:59] to know that it's not what you can do
[52:01] for him but what he has done for you
[52:04] now we look at the scripture and we must
[52:06] understand that the bible says that
[52:08] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[52:11] light
[52:12] uh it talks about how we have fellowship
[52:15] one with another and the blood of jesus
[52:17] christ his son
[52:19] cleanses us from all sin and you and i
[52:22] must
[52:23] understand this is what makes us
[52:24] different from the others
[52:27] because the sun doesn't stay in one
[52:29] place
[52:30] it moves from the east to the west
[52:34] you all know what i mean by that i mean
[52:37] as the earth rotates
[52:38] it moves we have seasons what we call
[52:42] winter spring summer and fall
[52:45] and you know but we understand
[52:48] that light doesn't stay in one place
[52:52] it moves and god works with those things
[52:56] according to his own pleasure in his own
[52:59] plan
[53:00] now that's basically the way the gospel
[53:03] has moved
[53:05] the bible said it was starred in the
[53:07] east
[53:08] and shine in the west and it says where
[53:11] the caucus
[53:11] is there will the eagles be gathered
[53:15] so we realize amen that the gospel have
[53:18] traveled from the east starting with
[53:20] lustre then wesley then the pentecostals
[53:23] and
[53:24] now god has brought us to a different
[53:26] light
[53:27] but but it is the light
[53:30] also when the light moves the blood
[53:33] moves
[53:34] as well you understand me i'ma say it
[53:37] again
[53:38] when the light moves the blood moves
[53:42] as well because what was good for
[53:46] yesterday that which would have
[53:49] satisfied god yesterday will not satisfy
[53:53] god today
[53:54] because the light has moved and you and
[53:58] i must
[53:58] always follow the pillar of fire
[54:01] wherever he is is where we
[54:05] want to be or should be now i said
[54:08] all of that to say amen that this
[54:11] message in itself
[54:13] if we don't move with it we become
[54:16] stagnant ourselves
[54:18] uh we know that jesus christ is the same
[54:20] yesterday today and forever
[54:22] he is a god that change is not
[54:25] our biggest adversary is is the devil
[54:28] himself
[54:29] and you and i must understand who he is
[54:33] now the bible says that we're not
[54:34] ignorant of his devices
[54:36] and so i want to just read a few
[54:38] scripture
[54:39] and expound on these scriptures so that
[54:42] we can believe where we are
[54:44] you understand me if this word the seals
[54:48] have been opened
[54:49] and and god called john and brother adam
[54:52] said
[54:52] that john typed out the church so when
[54:55] john was able to see
[54:57] all of these things prophecies and
[54:59] things
[55:00] amen that even he himself did not
[55:02] understand
[55:03] at the point of time but now that the
[55:06] word has been
[55:07] opened that which have been prophesied
[55:10] in daniel where the book was closed now
[55:12] that the book is
[55:13] open amen and the bible said that the
[55:16] book was opened in him who
[55:18] in his the hand who made it amen
[55:21] so we know that we're living in a time
[55:23] when the scripture has been opened
[55:25] and then the word of god said let him
[55:27] that read it because there's a time
[55:29] no man can read it and understand it but
[55:32] now let him that
[55:34] readeth run because he who tarry won't
[55:37] always carry
[55:38] god is not going to always wait and now
[55:41] we're approaching
[55:42] amen the translation of the saints hello
[55:46] now if that be true which it is then
[55:48] where are we
[55:50] in time you know there's not going to be
[55:53] a great universal
[55:55] uh uh revival i mean that has already
[55:58] happened
[55:59] but each and every one of us is being
[56:02] revived
[56:03] now the bride revival is actually going
[56:06] on now
[56:07] in the hearts of individuals and that
[56:10] that revival is removing all of the
[56:14] trash
[56:14] out of your life hallelujah
[56:18] you understand me it's like a dirty cup
[56:20] you pick it up it's dirty as
[56:22] justification
[56:23] you wash the cup right you bring it to a
[56:25] sanctification
[56:27] and then when you feel it up you bring
[56:28] it into use which is the holy ghost
[56:31] hallelujah but the cup was a cup when
[56:33] you found it
[56:35] hallelujah you understand me a son
[56:38] is a son a daughter is a son a daughter
[56:41] no matter how filthy and dirty you were
[56:43] before god picked you up
[56:46] it does not change who you are you were
[56:49] that when he picked you up
[56:52] so now the scripture says all
[56:55] spiritual blessings so you can't make
[56:58] god a liar
[57:00] now i'm going to come to that in just a
[57:01] moment because when the devil said you
[57:03] can't have
[57:04] such and such he is a liar
[57:08] you understand me if god has said that
[57:10] all spiritual blessings is given to you
[57:13] by way of christ jesus right
[57:18] you must believe that
[57:21] we don't even know what all is but it
[57:24] surpasses our understanding
[57:27] in other words we do not have to live
[57:30] like
[57:30] beggars or failures
[57:34] or people amen who who cannot accomplish
[57:37] anything
[57:37] now paul has told us we're more than
[57:40] conquerors
[57:41] through christ we can't do it but he
[57:44] has already done it for us
[57:49] sometimes we we get to the place where
[57:51] we
[57:52] mix up law and grace and i know how that
[57:54] is because i have struggled many times
[57:56] myself
[57:57] but the truth of the matter is amen none
[58:00] of us
[58:01] can work hard enough to make a rapture
[58:04] amen i'm gonna say that again
[58:08] none of us can make work hard enough
[58:11] to make a rapture our words will never
[58:15] make us worthy hallelujah why
[58:18] because the bible said we are accepting
[58:21] in the beloved
[58:23] so why would we allow satan to make us
[58:26] think
[58:26] we're not going to make it just to hear
[58:29] this message
[58:30] the bible said if you can hear it and
[58:31] read it says you are blessed
[58:36] the blessed and nobody no one can
[58:39] curse that in which god has blessed now
[58:42] ephesians 1 20 says
[58:44] which he had wrought in christ when he
[58:47] raised him from the dead
[58:49] and set him at his own right hand
[58:52] in heavenly places far i need you to
[58:56] listen to this
[58:57] far above all principalities and power
[59:01] and might and dominion and every name
[59:03] that is named
[59:04] not only in this world but also in that
[59:08] world which is to come you understand
[59:10] what paul is saying
[59:12] you are setting in heavenly places in
[59:15] christ jesus
[59:16] right now which he wrought in christ
[59:20] when he raised it from the dead and set
[59:22] him as
[59:23] his own right hand that right hand means
[59:25] power
[59:26] and authority where in heavenly places
[59:31] listen oh i i might be able to defeat
[59:34] the devil no sir
[59:36] far above all principalities it doesn't
[59:39] matter
[59:40] if he's the king of satan or satan is
[59:42] the king of all
[59:43] satan has been defeated and we must
[59:46] always remember
[59:48] he has no power no power at
[59:51] all and if there is power if there's
[59:53] some that he have
[59:54] you gave it to him
[59:59] when he wrought in christ i'mma say it
[1:00:01] when he raised him from the dead and
[1:00:03] said him
[1:00:03] now we're in him we are in christ
[1:00:07] sitting in heavenly places that means
[1:00:09] wherever he
[1:00:10] is we are and that what that means
[1:00:13] whatever authority he has
[1:00:15] we have are far above principalities
[1:00:19] and power and might and dominion
[1:00:23] hallelujah it doesn't matter what you
[1:00:26] call the name of the demon or the devil
[1:00:29] remember the word satan is not even in
[1:00:31] the bible
[1:00:34] we put that in there we gave him a name
[1:00:38] he was just a devil
[1:00:41] a name was once once once once
[1:00:44] only one time you'll find the name
[1:00:46] lucifer
[1:00:48] and that was when he was with god but
[1:00:50] when he fell
[1:00:51] he received a new name and only thing
[1:00:54] god gave him was a devil
[1:00:58] just described his character i'ma come
[1:01:01] on with it
[1:01:02] because i want you to understand
[1:01:04] anything that is not truth
[1:01:06] is a lie and anything that is a lie
[1:01:09] is the devil may manifest
[1:01:13] right you say well i got cancer that's
[1:01:16] a lie because with his stripes we were
[1:01:20] healed
[1:01:22] you see what i'm saying oh i got this no
[1:01:24] you don't that's a lie
[1:01:26] if you believe a lot see that lie is a
[1:01:28] devil
[1:01:30] and that devil is there to make you
[1:01:32] believe his lie
[1:01:33] but if you stand on the word of truth
[1:01:36] the bible says it will make you
[1:01:38] free no devil nothing can stand
[1:01:42] in the face of truth far
[1:01:45] well i like that word far that that
[1:01:48] don't mean
[1:01:48] close i mean far
[1:01:52] above all principalities and power and
[1:01:55] might
[1:01:55] and dominion and every name that is
[1:01:57] named not only in this world this is
[1:02:00] what i'm talking about
[1:02:01] but also in that which is to come
[1:02:04] in not just in this world but the other
[1:02:08] dimension
[1:02:12] we're you know this is where god is
[1:02:13] trying to tell us we're in this third
[1:02:15] dimension
[1:02:16] but we must elevate our minds to the
[1:02:19] higher dimension
[1:02:20] where god works and operates
[1:02:24] you know that's the only way that you
[1:02:25] can get the holy ghost your mind has to
[1:02:28] switch
[1:02:29] from this third dimension into the
[1:02:32] dimension where god is
[1:02:34] amen boldly go go before the throne of
[1:02:38] grace where
[1:02:39] not here in another dimension
[1:02:42] and you have to bring yourself to that
[1:02:44] condition
[1:02:47] that's why sometimes people don't
[1:02:48] understand why it takes a long while to
[1:02:50] get into that prayer
[1:02:52] because you're you're traveling you're
[1:02:54] pressing from out of this dimension into
[1:02:56] that next dimension
[1:02:58] and when you get in that heavenly
[1:02:59] dimension that heavenly place
[1:03:01] all of a sudden words come to your mind
[1:03:03] prayer words thoughts and things from
[1:03:05] your word
[1:03:05] that normally won't come to you in this
[1:03:08] dimension
[1:03:14] you know what it is sometimes people
[1:03:16] don't understand
[1:03:17] that being carnal can't get you there
[1:03:20] that's right you got to be spiritual
[1:03:22] minded to get there
[1:03:23] and you can be being spiritual minded
[1:03:25] without the spirit of god
[1:03:27] making you spiritually minded amen
[1:03:32] you know it's amazing that we this word
[1:03:35] was behind the
[1:03:37] veil and we treat it like his common
[1:03:39] manner
[1:03:41] it's not what god has brought to this
[1:03:44] message
[1:03:45] in this last day is not common manner
[1:03:47] once it become common to you
[1:03:50] you're not walking in the light as he is
[1:03:52] in the light
[1:03:53] because the bible said in his presence
[1:03:56] there's fullness of joy
[1:04:00] hallelujah and have put all things on
[1:04:02] his feet
[1:04:03] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:04:06] things
[1:04:07] to the church which is his body
[1:04:10] the fullness of him that filleth all
[1:04:13] wait a minute
[1:04:14] the church which is his body that
[1:04:17] filleth
[1:04:17] all uh which of the fullness of him
[1:04:21] that filleth all all and in all
[1:04:25] can't get away from him ephesians 2 4
[1:04:29] but god this is what i love about him he
[1:04:32] lays it out that's why
[1:04:33] brother branham says that that ephesians
[1:04:35] parallels joshua
[1:04:37] because you got to fight to maintain
[1:04:40] this it just doesn't come easy
[1:04:43] because you got you got all of the uh
[1:04:47] the ikes fighting get against you in
[1:04:50] this territory
[1:04:52] hallelujah but god who is rich in mercy
[1:04:56] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:04:59] when even when he were dead and even
[1:05:02] when we
[1:05:03] we were dead in sins have quickened us
[1:05:06] together with christ
[1:05:08] by grace you are saved
[1:05:11] hallelujah hey and have raised us up
[1:05:15] together and made us together
[1:05:17] in heavenly places in christ jesus he
[1:05:20] said
[1:05:21] made us you know what made to make
[1:05:24] somebody do something he put you there
[1:05:29] made you sit in heavenly places in
[1:05:32] christ jesus
[1:05:32] you got to understand about jesus he's
[1:05:35] the only one that can change the
[1:05:36] dimensions
[1:05:37] he can walk from one to another with no
[1:05:40] problem
[1:05:42] hallelujah and because of that
[1:05:46] amen have you ever thought about it this
[1:05:48] i'm gonna throw something out at you
[1:05:49] because this will
[1:05:50] be something that i'll be working with
[1:05:52] in the future but you know what
[1:05:54] brother bam said when we have heard this
[1:05:56] message we have heard from our theophany
[1:06:01] well you must understand that theophany
[1:06:03] is a body
[1:06:05] and every spirit don't have theophanies
[1:06:09] so where do their spirits go
[1:06:14] they don't have bodies
[1:06:18] i don't know how they move from one
[1:06:20] place to another
[1:06:22] i don't even know how they recognizable
[1:06:25] because remember the rich young ruler
[1:06:26] was not recognizable
[1:06:29] well we know that that lazarus was
[1:06:33] but the point uh i'm getting over to you
[1:06:36] is this
[1:06:37] can you imagine brother i'm saying like
[1:06:38] this he said one of the worst things i
[1:06:40] when i came to dying i feared and that
[1:06:42] was that you know we'd be like a puff
[1:06:44] cloud somewhere
[1:06:46] without shape boy can you imagine
[1:06:49] and that's the way the world was before
[1:06:52] god said let there be light
[1:06:54] it was void without shape it was
[1:06:58] lost
[1:07:01] and i'm just you know i look at this
[1:07:03] thing and i said i've always wondered
[1:07:05] why we have in our minds that these
[1:07:08] people are going to have
[1:07:09] these bodies and i don't know that
[1:07:11] that's lost and i don't know how all
[1:07:12] that worked
[1:07:13] but i think to myself then what body
[1:07:15] that they do have
[1:07:17] because see the word body is eternal
[1:07:21] you understand me but whatever they're
[1:07:23] in
[1:07:24] even if it's just a spirit or whatever
[1:07:27] the bible says
[1:07:28] in that place the worms never die
[1:07:32] so whatever that is i don't want it
[1:07:37] you understand me whatever state of
[1:07:40] being they
[1:07:40] are in let them have that
[1:07:44] because that in itself is hell
[1:07:52] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:07:55] great love wherewith he
[1:07:56] loved us even when we were dead and sins
[1:08:00] have quickened us together
[1:08:01] with christ i have to say it by grace
[1:08:05] he are saved see you got to understand
[1:08:08] he
[1:08:08] quickened us what makes you love this
[1:08:11] message
[1:08:12] he did it in all that you've gone
[1:08:15] through why do you stay with it
[1:08:18] because of him he quickened you
[1:08:22] how many people walked in the face of
[1:08:24] jesus
[1:08:25] looked in the face of jesus and turned
[1:08:27] away from it
[1:08:28] saw him touched him is that right oh
[1:08:32] yeah
[1:08:33] the bible says there were times they
[1:08:35] thrown him that means they were so close
[1:08:37] to him they
[1:08:38] were bumping you know but
[1:08:41] even in that crowd they still walked
[1:08:44] away from christ
[1:08:47] they said oh he touched me see that
[1:08:50] ain't enough
[1:08:51] you need more than a touch you need an
[1:08:54] infielding
[1:08:58] totally in feeling
[1:09:01] right because now remember when they're
[1:09:03] raised up in that second resurrection
[1:09:06] they raised up in whatever body they had
[1:09:08] before
[1:09:09] but what is it that they have in hell
[1:09:13] it can't be eternal
[1:09:17] but whatever it is they can feel
[1:09:22] they can smell i soon smell whatever
[1:09:24] senses are heightened
[1:09:26] at least that's what they say but i
[1:09:28] don't know no man
[1:09:29] scripturally you know how they say oh i
[1:09:32] died and i went to hell
[1:09:33] and i saw whatever well
[1:09:39] if god told lazarus the rich young ruler
[1:09:41] you couldn't come back
[1:09:43] that's the word how you figure all these
[1:09:46] other people are coming back
[1:09:49] it's a lie i am telling you
[1:09:52] it's a lie because once you're gone
[1:09:56] you're gone you can't come back and
[1:09:59] y'all
[1:10:00] have you ever noticed the people that
[1:10:01] die and come back
[1:10:03] there is no truth that they believe
[1:10:08] many people who have not even don't even
[1:10:10] know jesus
[1:10:12] but they die and come back i don't know
[1:10:14] what that is
[1:10:15] but i know one thing according to the
[1:10:17] word once you're dead
[1:10:20] and you go to hell or wherever the rich
[1:10:23] young ruler was
[1:10:24] you don't get a second chance if that be
[1:10:26] the case
[1:10:27] god would have to raise him back up and
[1:10:29] say okay go preach to your brothers
[1:10:32] see but we'll believe that lie we'll
[1:10:35] believe it because it sounds good or
[1:10:37] sound right
[1:10:38] it ain't about sounding right it's
[1:10:41] whether it is right
[1:10:43] because you got to understand brother
[1:10:45] baby said but once your time is up on
[1:10:47] this earth it's
[1:10:48] up you're finished
[1:10:54] i'm not saying they i don't know where
[1:10:57] they
[1:10:58] were maybe it was a coma
[1:11:02] i don't understand it but i know one
[1:11:05] thing
[1:11:06] satan is a liar and even in that ram he
[1:11:09] can deceive you
[1:11:11] making you think you see jesus and one
[1:11:14] of the things that give me this
[1:11:16] oh i went over there and i saw children
[1:11:19] and babies
[1:11:20] do you really think god would do that to
[1:11:22] you
[1:11:24] can you imagine a man nursing a baby
[1:11:28] through eternity
[1:11:31] babies came by the fault and i'm off my
[1:11:33] message but i'm building
[1:11:35] to show you that whatever is not truth
[1:11:38] is a lie
[1:11:39] and that lie is a manifestation of the
[1:11:42] devil
[1:11:47] i'm not talking about near-death
[1:11:48] experiences those things can be real
[1:11:52] but if you go down in there unless
[1:11:54] you're going by way of a dream
[1:11:58] you don't come out of there you
[1:12:00] understand me
[1:12:02] see now and raise us up together and
[1:12:05] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:12:06] in christ i'm coming that in this age to
[1:12:09] come
[1:12:09] he might show the exceeding riches of
[1:12:12] his grace
[1:12:12] in his kindness toward us through christ
[1:12:15] jesus now god is
[1:12:17] mad with you that ain't what the word
[1:12:20] says
[1:12:22] that is not is not what the word says
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:25] thought in your mind is what the devil
[1:12:28] has placed in you
[1:12:30] because if god has justified you as
[1:12:32] though you never said no i'm talking
[1:12:34] about holy ghost real people
[1:12:35] i'm not talking about potentials i'm
[1:12:38] some of the real god
[1:12:39] godly people who have come in contact
[1:12:41] with the philippians
[1:12:42] the holy spirit and now he's in you this
[1:12:46] is your covenant
[1:12:48] up until then his potential you've got
[1:12:50] to get to god and god must get to you
[1:12:56] is that right because you remember jacob
[1:12:58] had promises
[1:13:00] but jacob did not get what he wanted to
[1:13:02] get or needed to get
[1:13:03] until he wrestles with the angel
[1:13:06] that's prayer you wrestle with the angel
[1:13:10] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:13:12] and that not of yourself it
[1:13:14] is what the gift of god oh i've got they
[1:13:17] said brother
[1:13:18] i got faith i got faith brother i said
[1:13:19] if you had faith you wouldn't be up here
[1:13:22] you got perfect faith why are you coming
[1:13:24] up here in the prayer line
[1:13:27] hallelujah you understand me
[1:13:30] now i'm going to say something and i it
[1:13:32] might get on somebody's nerve
[1:13:35] but i can tell you when i look at the
[1:13:36] scripture when jesus was crashing out
[1:13:39] devils
[1:13:40] he spoke a word and he left it the devil
[1:13:43] had to go
[1:13:44] you'll never see it in oh praise god it
[1:13:47] took me
[1:13:47] hours to get rid of that devil that's a
[1:13:50] lie
[1:13:53] and i'm gonna tell you something he's
[1:13:55] gonna show up
[1:13:56] again the devil like he liked
[1:14:00] show he liked drama he he liked
[1:14:02] theatrical stuff
[1:14:04] right because remember the man who had
[1:14:06] the left uh the
[1:14:07] epilepsy when jesus told him to get up
[1:14:09] out of that man
[1:14:10] what did he do he wallet all over the
[1:14:12] floor jesus just stood there and said
[1:14:14] all right now
[1:14:16] you know i ain't gonna talk again i
[1:14:18] don't have to say get out
[1:14:19] once i told you why because light will
[1:14:23] always defeat darkness
[1:14:25] and truth will always prevail over a lie
[1:14:28] but people rather believe lies you see
[1:14:32] but what we fail to see is we got that
[1:14:34] hollywood thing
[1:14:35] even in the message that's hollywood
[1:14:41] you'll never see jesus do it and you
[1:14:43] never saw brother branham do it
[1:14:45] he never wrestled with the devil
[1:14:49] he spoke the word and the devil had to
[1:14:50] come out
[1:14:52] see let me tell you something when you
[1:14:53] know truth and you know that that's a
[1:14:55] lie
[1:14:56] that's that's that that has imprisoned
[1:14:58] that person
[1:14:59] truth will always set them free if they
[1:15:02] can receive it
[1:15:03] you don't have to go through all that
[1:15:05] sweat and carrying on i've seen people i
[1:15:07] know they're
[1:15:08] if they become christians it'll be a
[1:15:10] miracle
[1:15:11] because i've seen what pentecostal
[1:15:13] people do they shake their head and
[1:15:15] make them fall and you know all kinds of
[1:15:17] stuff
[1:15:18] in the name of this message
[1:15:23] oh no no no no no that's not truth
[1:15:28] well people get mad with me on that one
[1:15:30] that's okay
[1:15:32] for grace you are saved
[1:15:35] but by grace are ye saved through faith
[1:15:38] and that not of yourself it is the gift
[1:15:40] of god not a word
[1:15:41] lest any man shouldn't boast
[1:15:46] but we are his workmanship we are
[1:15:49] his workmanship he's working you you're
[1:15:53] not working him
[1:15:53] he's working you created in christ jesus
[1:15:57] unto good works which god hath before
[1:16:00] ordained
[1:16:01] that we shall walk excuse me in them
[1:16:04] what are you talking about are you going
[1:16:06] to make mistakes yeah but don't god is
[1:16:08] not even looking at that
[1:16:10] and i'm not saying listen i'm going to
[1:16:11] say well i can do what i want to do no
[1:16:13] the bible says if you say you have no
[1:16:16] sins you make him a liar
[1:16:17] and the truth is not in you hallelujah
[1:16:20] but when we
[1:16:21] do sin we confess our sins and god knows
[1:16:24] because we're going to confess it he's
[1:16:26] already forgotten it
[1:16:29] let me hurry up because i'm going too
[1:16:31] slow ephesians 3 8 says
[1:16:33] unto me who i am less than the least
[1:16:39] i just want to make sure i hadn't you
[1:16:41] don't you feel like you don't you have
[1:16:43] this longing in you though
[1:16:45] and there's a longing for god for god in
[1:16:48] you
[1:16:50] yes ephesians 3 8 says unto me
[1:16:53] who am less than the least of all saints
[1:16:56] is this grace given that i should preach
[1:17:00] among the gentiles the unsurgical riches
[1:17:03] of christ
[1:17:04] well then why do people feel like they
[1:17:07] know
[1:17:07] it all that's a lie
[1:17:11] it's unsearchable
[1:17:15] it's going to continue to unfold and
[1:17:17] unfold and unthought
[1:17:18] and we do just like the ages before us
[1:17:21] once god began to unfold another truth
[1:17:24] in the message
[1:17:25] we labor that person as being insane or
[1:17:28] you know you're leaving the message what
[1:17:30] did not lutheran say that to the
[1:17:32] wesleyans
[1:17:33] and didn't the western say that to the
[1:17:34] pentecostals
[1:17:36] and the pentecostals have said it to us
[1:17:39] and brother robin said when that seal
[1:17:40] opened rockets when
[1:17:42] whoa five went here and five out of ten
[1:17:44] five it continues
[1:17:47] until god brings a message and a word
[1:17:50] where it transforms us completely into
[1:17:53] the very image of god
[1:17:54] but first of all he must work on our
[1:17:56] minds
[1:17:58] our minds let this might be
[1:18:01] in you you understand me we've got to
[1:18:04] stop thinking like men
[1:18:05] working like men acting like men we must
[1:18:08] think like god and act like god
[1:18:11] hallelujah that's what jesus was trying
[1:18:13] to tell his disciples
[1:18:15] you have the authority over everything
[1:18:18] didn't that i read that just now of
[1:18:20] about principalities and powers and
[1:18:23] it doesn't matter who name it comes in
[1:18:26] you have the authority over it he's
[1:18:28] given that to us
[1:18:30] and we must receive it and we must
[1:18:32] believe it
[1:18:35] in order to please god otherwise you're
[1:18:37] gonna you're gonna believe a lie
[1:18:40] you're finished man you're not saying
[1:18:42] too much you've gone too far
[1:18:44] not with the grace of god do you don't
[1:18:47] you know the elected cannot blaspheme
[1:18:49] the holy ghost
[1:18:51] huh look look what paul did
[1:18:54] see what paul calls a lot of the
[1:18:58] new testament saying the blessing
[1:19:02] and you know he had been doing something
[1:19:04] but he was chosen and elected
[1:19:08] who's going to lay the charge in god's
[1:19:09] elect
[1:19:11] see not even god can lay a charge to you
[1:19:15] because you are elected if he puts
[1:19:18] that who that who who gonna lay in
[1:19:20] charge because he lacked
[1:19:24] y'all understand what i'm saying he bind
[1:19:26] him all himself with that that scripture
[1:19:29] who is he not a part of the who
[1:19:36] and what we must realize by god's grace
[1:19:39] amen that god is more than just
[1:19:41] how can i say it religion and you ought
[1:19:44] to be
[1:19:45] tired of it all of us ought to be
[1:19:48] ashamed we ought to be
[1:19:49] saying lord i gotta live above this
[1:19:51] carnality
[1:19:53] that's what god wants for us
[1:19:57] that early church did they weren't
[1:19:58] carnal they were spiritual
[1:20:01] and they were so spiritual it they would
[1:20:03] call christian at antioch why
[1:20:05] because they walked like and they talked
[1:20:07] like him they were the original seed
[1:20:09] they're the ones who fell into the
[1:20:11] ground that we might be living today
[1:20:15] yeah and we supposed to bring forth the
[1:20:17] same kind
[1:20:20] not some organization some club and
[1:20:23] that's
[1:20:23] that's basically what a lot of us have
[1:20:25] become like a message club you know
[1:20:29] god help us
[1:20:34] unto me who am les paul uh paul says
[1:20:37] unto me who's less than the least of
[1:20:39] all the saints is the grace of given
[1:20:41] that i should preach among the gentiles
[1:20:43] the unsearchable riches of christ
[1:20:45] and to make all men see what is the
[1:20:47] fellowship
[1:20:48] of the mystery which from the beginning
[1:20:50] of the world
[1:20:51] have been hid in god who created all
[1:20:54] things by jesus christ but let me tell
[1:20:56] you something see because god reveals
[1:20:58] something to you
[1:20:59] and doesn't reveal something to the next
[1:21:01] man look at all the people
[1:21:02] who god revealed that jesus christ was
[1:21:05] the messiah
[1:21:06] and those people who could not see it
[1:21:08] they called those people who the
[1:21:09] revelation came to
[1:21:10] devils but that's what we do
[1:21:14] because you don't see it i tell you what
[1:21:16] what we need to do is stop praying
[1:21:18] and stop trying amen to sift this
[1:21:21] message
[1:21:21] through your previous
[1:21:25] teachings this is
[1:21:28] the urim ethereum and this is where you
[1:21:31] take every thought
[1:21:33] and go back to it
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:38] that's what we do and you and i must
[1:21:41] understand this thing is
[1:21:42] it's it's mighty what i'm seeing it's
[1:21:44] mighty it's just
[1:21:46] it's mighty
[1:21:49] just those words come up hither that was
[1:21:52] the bride
[1:21:53] that's john that means you gotta you
[1:21:56] can't stay here
[1:21:58] for me to show you what i need to show
[1:22:00] you you've got to believe
[1:22:01] earth you understand me so what are you
[1:22:04] saying
[1:22:05] think about it when christ was crucified
[1:22:08] he was
[1:22:08] suspended in in in a dimensional form
[1:22:12] he was right in between heaven and earth
[1:22:16] and if you're going to see him you got
[1:22:18] to look up to see it
[1:22:20] right that's it
[1:22:28] listen brother i'm saying like this he
[1:22:29] says there is something inside of me
[1:22:32] and i want to bring this to your mind
[1:22:34] let me tell you something whenever a
[1:22:35] challenge comes don't you back down
[1:22:39] don't you don't you call down like like
[1:22:41] moses did and he did
[1:22:43] brother batman said he got scared god
[1:22:46] said why christ
[1:22:47] speak he said but you take the anointing
[1:22:48] of david when goliath amen was over
[1:22:51] there boasting
[1:22:52] god like it just gave david more power
[1:22:55] more strength
[1:22:56] more courage why because he knew his god
[1:22:59] was supernatural
[1:23:00] and he understood his god was god
[1:23:03] he wasn't afraid of goliath
[1:23:07] goliath boasting was a lie
[1:23:10] and all the boastings of the devil is a
[1:23:13] lie
[1:23:14] listen even y'all know i don't you know
[1:23:18] i was at my doctor the other day and you

[1:23:32] they're not gonna understand it but i
[1:23:34] i will it's because i believe it
[1:23:39] but you know he acted as if i didn't get
[1:23:41] the shot
[1:23:42] you know he don't know whether he's
[1:23:43] going to wait work on me i'm like do you
[1:23:45] think i can

[1:23:49] man who's creator of all things

[1:23:59] christ hallelujah that's jesus christ
[1:24:02] himself
[1:24:03] hallelujah you know they tried to get
[1:24:05] rid of paul

[1:24:12] supposed to be
[1:24:13] dead and here he is over here preaching

[1:28:24] that term
[1:28:25] hot breath of judgment
[1:28:28] you know and one place he was talking
[1:28:30] about the hound that was after the deer

[1:28:52] judgment when he said that i thought
[1:28:55] about all the volcanoes
[1:28:57] you know but he says come into christ
[1:29:00] when you see the hot breath of judgment
[1:29:03] hanging on each side now swinging
[1:29:06] 1800 miles in an hour
[1:29:10] an hour uh around i think he's talking
[1:29:13] about dispatching
[1:29:14] and 18 000 miles an hour around and
[1:29:17] around the world
[1:29:18] and a sinful nation with their hands on
[1:29:21] a button
[1:29:21] that could send us all to power powder
[1:29:25] in five minutes he said don't look for
[1:29:27] something great to come
[1:29:29] a great revival you look for the coming
[1:29:32] of the lord

[1:29:36] your eyes to
[1:29:38] these things
[1:29:41] the devil he's making us think oh we got
[1:29:44] all this time
[1:29:45] and we know character-wise we're not
[1:29:50] there yeah
[1:29:53] he's coming back for characters is that
[1:29:55] right brother brown said he's coming
[1:29:57] back for character
[1:29:59] hallelujah god don't care about how long
[1:30:03] you've been to church how long you've
[1:30:04] gone to church how
[1:30:06] what how you dress what job you got he
[1:30:08] don't
[1:30:09] he doesn't care anything about that
[1:30:13] he's only looking for his image
[1:30:20] what we need is a holy ghost
[1:30:24] atmosphere that's right an atmosphere
[1:30:27] where the power of god
[1:30:29] are moving one accord one place
[1:30:32] gathered together under the atmosphere
[1:30:34] of expecting
[1:30:36] god to move down and do signs and
[1:30:38] wonders
[1:30:39] see what he's saying is that what we
[1:30:41] need now people say well you know
[1:30:43] what time or what message was that in
[1:30:45] i'll tell them what time and what it was
[1:30:47] it was the same yesterday today and
[1:30:49] forever
[1:30:52] god don't change we think we're going to
[1:30:54] be these
[1:30:55] intellectual message people that's
[1:30:57] nonsense
[1:30:59] amen that's a lie brother the bible
[1:31:02] tells
[1:31:03] us that you shall have power after which
[1:31:05] the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:31:07] amen and you mean to tell me we got all
[1:31:09] his power

[1:36:55] i'm just gonna give you a warning though
[1:36:57] didn't even give me a sheet of paper
[1:36:59] just a voice warning what was that that
[1:37:02] was god
[1:37:03] see the word is right
[1:37:10] hallelujah remember the bible says enoch
[1:37:13] walked with god and was found not
[1:37:18] he no whirlwind picked him up he doesn't
[1:37:20] say
[1:37:21] it just said he walked with god and
[1:37:23] enoch types the bride
[1:37:25] and brother brown said that one day
[1:37:26] enoch was walking with god he turned
[1:37:29] around and said goodbye to his family
[1:37:33] and he was found not now what do you
[1:37:36] think you're doing
[1:37:38] enoch was in a different dimension y'all
[1:37:41] hear me
[1:37:42] many times brother branham lived in it
[1:37:44] when he began to talk
[1:37:45] okay you this and he went way in the
[1:37:48] future went all the way in the past
[1:37:50] what was it he was in two dimensions
[1:37:53] but we're to live in this this is what
[1:37:56] the seals were all about
[1:37:58] this is the breaking of the word this is
[1:38:00] what the thunders was all about
[1:38:01] he said i can't tell you how to do it i
[1:38:03] can't tell you what's there
[1:38:04] but this is where you belong because
[1:38:07] we're the only generation
[1:38:09] that had that portion that could not be
[1:38:12] explained he explained everything else
[1:38:16] but now this we're the generation that
[1:38:19] he couldn't explain it
[1:38:20] then if he couldn't explain it then let
[1:38:22] me ask you a question
[1:38:24] how will we know what to do the bible
[1:38:26] says
[1:38:27] that the holy ghost will lead you and
[1:38:29] guides you
[1:38:30] into all truth it'll be revelation after
[1:38:33] revelation at the revelation
[1:38:35] and that revelation is given to you
[1:38:37] personally
[1:38:42] personally
[1:38:45] help us jesus we're sitting in heavenly
[1:38:47] places in christchurch and you know what
[1:38:49] i'm excited
[1:38:50] because one of these old days we're
[1:38:52] going to walk from this dimension to the
[1:38:54] next
[1:38:54] they will look for us and we'll be gone
[1:39:00] can i say something when jesus rose from
[1:39:03] the dead i want you to understand he
[1:39:04] revealed himself
[1:39:07] in different ways to different people so
[1:39:09] your revelation of him
[1:39:11] after you know may be a little different
[1:39:17] you understand me at the
[1:39:20] at the at when he rose from the dead
[1:39:22] when mary came there he was the gardener
[1:39:25] understand me hallelujah and then
[1:39:29] when when they were on their road to
[1:39:30] emmaus he was a
[1:39:32] stranger but he began to appear to them
[1:39:36] in different forms and different ways
[1:39:38] to where they didn't even recognize him
[1:39:41] until
[1:39:42] he called mary mary
[1:39:47] so this message you may not have it like
[1:39:50] i got it
[1:39:50] but whatever you have will be that
[1:39:53] portion that will translate you
[1:39:55] one thing for certain they came and said
[1:39:58] he's alive
[1:40:00] he's risen hallelujah y'all understand
[1:40:03] me
[1:40:04] and that's what he's doing now amen he's
[1:40:06] revealing himself to individuals in
[1:40:08] different ways
[1:40:10] but he's still the same lord jesus
[1:40:13] so much so thomas says well i ain't
[1:40:15] going to believe your revelation
[1:40:17] until i see him myself
[1:40:20] and because he was elected and what i
[1:40:23] understand is that once thomas seen
[1:40:26] jesus and he became god to thomas thomas
[1:40:29] had one of the greater missionary
[1:40:31] admissions
[1:40:32] of all the disciples and you may not
[1:40:34] hear much of him but he went to india
[1:40:36] and tore it up
[1:40:39] you see what i'm saying i just believe
[1:40:42] with all my heart people
[1:40:44] when it comes to christ you know
[1:40:50] i used to be you know a lot of times you
[1:40:52] don't know your god pride until
[1:40:55] i used to have such a pride i wanted to
[1:40:58] pray for people but i didn't want people
[1:41:00] to know when i got sick
[1:41:03] and i used to so hate it when my wife
[1:41:06] would put in a prayer request
[1:41:09] for me because with me i'm not supposed
[1:41:13] to get sick
[1:41:14] you understand me i thought i had a
[1:41:16] faith that that ain't gonna happen to me
[1:41:18] y'all understand me that's what happened
[1:41:21] even with the copy
[1:41:23] god had to humble me it ain't gonna
[1:41:26] happen to me
[1:41:27] y'all understand me
[1:41:31] i was more embarrassed than anything now
[1:41:33] that's pride
[1:41:39] many other afflictions are the righteous
[1:41:41] and god will deliver you
[1:41:43] and it seems like when people still are
[1:41:45] ashamed to tell people
[1:41:46] well i got colby they still ashamed of
[1:41:50] it like it's some
[1:41:51] something to be ashamed of well you
[1:41:53] don't see no well you know what i had a
[1:41:55] bad flu they said
[1:41:58] nobody of it but when it come to covert
[1:42:01] oh you did and some people act like
[1:42:03] you're still contagious
[1:42:05] shame it's a shame it's a shame but let
[1:42:08] me show you something i gotta hurry i
[1:42:09] gotta hurry
[1:42:10] show you what lies are right in the
[1:42:13] christian
[1:42:14] realm even when it comes
[1:42:17] to christmas do you know what the devil
[1:42:21] has done he's placed a lie in there
[1:42:24] first of all it's a lie that he was born
[1:42:26] on december in
[1:42:28] december we believe it
[1:42:31] many people celebrate and carry on amen
[1:42:34] with christmas amen and they think well
[1:42:36] they put up all their decorations and
[1:42:38] the three wise man is dead
[1:42:40] that's a lie
[1:42:43] he said they weren't there but we
[1:42:46] believe it
[1:42:47] you know what what i'm saying we believe
[1:42:49] it look you go in
[1:42:50] all the stores and you see angels with
[1:42:53] wings
[1:42:55] when you die you do not get wings
[1:43:00] but we'll believe it right
[1:43:04] and we got this thing in our mind that
[1:43:06] the devil has this
[1:43:08] red face a blue face with pointed ears
[1:43:10] and this net and a pink falcon
[1:43:12] where is that scripturally nowhere
[1:43:17] it's hollywood it's the devil
[1:43:20] who makes it so just to make you fear
[1:43:29] oh it's true you know and we
[1:43:32] we don't we don't you know we don't even
[1:43:34] take what the bible said hell is
[1:43:39] right now you know a lot of these people
[1:43:41] think when they go to hell they gonna
[1:43:43] party
[1:43:43] you'll be jumping but it won't be
[1:43:45] because of the music
[1:43:49] as i said like casting out devils look
[1:43:51] what they've done to easter
[1:43:53] you ask a lot of people out there in the
[1:43:55] world now who who
[1:43:56] have christian backgrounds i guarantee
[1:43:58] you they're coloring eggs
[1:44:01] and bunnies and all that and i used to
[1:44:03] think those little chickadees were so
[1:44:05] cute when they were green and pink and
[1:44:06] orange
[1:44:08] but they don't remain that let them grow
[1:44:12] up and all those colored fellas are
[1:44:13] going to disappear
[1:44:15] and the truth will be known but i'm
[1:44:18] trying to tell you this that whatever is
[1:44:20] a lie
[1:44:21] is not of god
[1:44:27] this is another lie that's been given to
[1:44:29] message people
[1:44:30] that if the more revelation they have
[1:44:33] the more secure they are
[1:44:35] and paul said you can understand all
[1:44:37] mysteries
[1:44:39] and have that charity they ain't even
[1:44:41] working about with charity
[1:44:43] but have not charity it profits you
[1:44:45] nothing and charity is the holy ghost
[1:44:47] the divine nature of god but they're not
[1:44:49] worried about that they worried about
[1:44:51] this quote and that quote and i can
[1:44:52] remember oh i know this this this this
[1:44:55] and you don't understand there's so many
[1:44:59] who are still lost but religious
[1:45:05] don't talk like that brother bro where
[1:45:06] you get your authority just ask him
[1:45:09] he's the one speaking it i don't have
[1:45:11] those on my notes
[1:45:13] paul amen according to titus i'm a hurry
[1:45:15] a servant of god and apostle of jesus
[1:45:17] christ
[1:45:18] according to the faith of god's elect
[1:45:20] and an
[1:45:21] acknowledgement of the truth which is
[1:45:25] after godliness
[1:45:29] you can't be godly unless you've got god
[1:45:32] yeah
[1:45:32] in hope of eternal life with god that
[1:45:36] cannot lie promise before the world
[1:45:41] began now he promised us eternal life
[1:45:46] right but have in due time
[1:45:49] manifested his word through preaching
[1:45:52] which he committed unto me
[1:45:54] according to the commandment of god
[1:45:57] our savior paul said it's committed
[1:46:01] i got to show the gentiles this
[1:46:04] wonderful thing god has done for them
[1:46:06] it's unsearchable riches it's beyond
[1:46:10] anything i've ever seen before
[1:46:12] what god has done he's chosen a gentile
[1:46:15] bride
[1:46:16] y'all hear me now you got to understand
[1:46:19] that god even when it came to esther
[1:46:21] elsa didn't fully know who she was until
[1:46:25] times changed things started changing
[1:46:29] and then esther found herself in a place
[1:46:31] she never thought she'd ever be
[1:46:33] in her life
[1:46:37] and god has to change things that's why
[1:46:40] this whole
[1:46:41] mess we got in this world is moving it's
[1:46:44] not
[1:46:45] just do you realize it's not just in
[1:46:47] america
[1:46:49] the whole world is conspiring
[1:46:53] and everything has become a racial issue
[1:46:57] did y'all know all over the world
[1:47:00] and everybody won't recompense
[1:47:06] pay me for making me this way
[1:47:09] oh come on somebody and you know what
[1:47:12] that's the way
[1:47:13] it is everybody feels like they can pay
[1:47:16] their way out
[1:47:18] no no the price has already been paid
[1:47:20] and the only way out is jesus christ
[1:47:23] right i heard somebody say the other day
[1:47:26] it ain't a skin problem it's a sin
[1:47:34] problem
[1:47:36] y'all it's so funny it really is
[1:47:40] i said people are so s i don't want to
[1:47:42] come lord have mercy
[1:47:43] we all i don't care what color you are
[1:47:46] you're born the same way your daughter
[1:47:48] say wait
[1:47:49] you're born like an animal and you die
[1:47:51] like one
[1:47:57] and what we're afraid of is that satan
[1:47:59] is stripped of all his powers
[1:48:02] you know let me see one more thing
[1:48:04] everybody talking about equity
[1:48:06] what is that ain't nobody gonna be
[1:48:10] equal not in this world
[1:48:16] you can try to give everybody the same
[1:48:18] amount of money give them all the same
[1:48:20] amount
[1:48:22] at the end of the day one gonna have
[1:48:24] zero
[1:48:27] and the other one's gonna have some
[1:48:28] investments you understand me
[1:48:31] because they made different they think
[1:48:33] different
[1:48:34] they act different there's such thing no
[1:48:37] such thing
[1:48:37] i don't know what people are thinking
[1:48:39] what it's never been and never will be
[1:48:41] right since the fall there's never been
[1:48:44] equity there's never been equals
[1:48:46] never
[1:48:49] you know everybody think when they get
[1:48:50] to heaven it's gonna be equity
[1:48:55] but everybody's gonna have different
[1:48:57] rewards
[1:48:58] everybody ain't to have the same stuff
[1:49:00] but the only difference is we're not
[1:49:02] going to be jealous of one another
[1:49:05] we're just not going to be that way and
[1:49:08] that's mainly the reason why
[1:49:10] everybody is the way they are because
[1:49:12] one can have more than the other because
[1:49:14] it's jealousy just plain old jealousy
[1:49:16] let me move on that one that wasn't part
[1:49:18] of the word that
[1:49:20] what god put there so let me hurry up
[1:49:22] right listen
[1:49:24] satan not he like i said the word is not
[1:49:26] even found in the bible
[1:49:28] he's discovered as the devil that's
[1:49:32] the devil you know and
[1:49:35] they made satan such a character till
[1:49:37] everybody's afraid of him
[1:49:40] and when it comes to casting out devils
[1:49:42] you know he puts on this thing
[1:49:44] and he's just making everybody fear and
[1:49:47] you can't fear him
[1:49:49] you can't listen you can't go over in
[1:49:52] africa or
[1:49:53] india anywhere those places where they
[1:49:55] you know what what people don't realize
[1:49:56] is that we got more witches here in
[1:49:58] america than they have over there
[1:50:03] they just look different you understand
[1:50:06] me so my point is
[1:50:08] how are you gonna be afraid of a witch
[1:50:09] or a devil and say you got jesus
[1:50:13] that's a lie that's a lie
[1:50:17] it irritated paul when that woman was
[1:50:20] carrying on
[1:50:21] you know oh blessed that son of god
[1:50:23] whatever she was saying
[1:50:25] and he had to put up with that for
[1:50:26] several church
[1:50:28] search services before he could call
[1:50:30] that demon out of her
[1:50:32] he didn't wrestle with her he called it
[1:50:34] out
[1:50:35] the devil had to go
[1:50:38] let me hurry y'all understand what i'm
[1:50:41] trying to say
[1:50:42] authority is a different word from just
[1:50:44] power
[1:50:46] and even the devil has to obey you
[1:50:48] because
[1:50:49] all of heaven and earth is named after
[1:50:51] him
[1:50:52] your name lord jesus christ amen
[1:50:55] is a threat to his kingdom and if you
[1:50:58] learn how to use it
[1:51:00] he'll tremble in his shoes just like
[1:51:02] legion did when he saw jesus
[1:51:07] let me hurry up lord i'm taking too much
[1:51:09] time but listen
[1:51:10] um
[1:51:14] look what brother um says he said now
[1:51:16] now we use the devil the word satan
[1:51:18] because we
[1:51:18] identify him as the chief one but and he
[1:51:21] said and satan
[1:51:23] you who bound the people are charged
[1:51:26] thee as a deceiver
[1:51:28] and that's what a lie is deception i
[1:51:30] charge thee as having no power
[1:51:33] you're only a deceiver jesus christ
[1:51:37] triumphed over all the powers you have
[1:51:40] and strip you from every power you're
[1:51:43] deceiving the people
[1:51:45] and you've been exposed tonight come out
[1:51:48] of this
[1:51:49] audience can you imagine
[1:51:52] brother branham having to go one by one
[1:51:55] trying to cast out devils and wrestle
[1:51:57] with them and
[1:51:58] yeah come up out of here
[1:52:03] come out of this audience in the name of
[1:52:07] jesus christ
[1:52:08] leave them people and they did
[1:52:14] he said our lord died at calvary and
[1:52:16] through his holy unadulterated blood
[1:52:19] unadulterated blood the blood of the
[1:52:20] almighty god that was broken at calvary
[1:52:22] you redeemed the human race lord and you
[1:52:25] defeated satan
[1:52:26] by the same blood stripped him of every
[1:52:29] power that he had
[1:52:31] now y'all understand why i'm reading
[1:52:32] this because we give him power
[1:52:34] when he doesn't have any now you're
[1:52:36] either going to believe the word
[1:52:39] right or you're going to believe the lie
[1:52:42] don't blame god
[1:52:44] if you believe the lie because if you
[1:52:46] believe the lie
[1:52:47] you're going to get a manifestation of
[1:52:49] that lie
[1:52:52] and we're living in a generation even
[1:52:54] with lies
[1:52:56] amen are exhausted remember satan said
[1:52:58] i'm going to exalt myself
[1:53:00] and that's ex he's a liar
[1:53:03] and that's what he's doing he's
[1:53:04] exhausting his life and the bible said
[1:53:07] every evil imagination every one of them
[1:53:11] pull them down anything that exalts
[1:53:14] itself above the word of god
[1:53:15] pull it down it's a lie
[1:53:22] hallelujah oh god i didn't intend to go
[1:53:26] this long
[1:53:31] let me read this and i'm gonna let you
[1:53:32] go saint john 8
[1:53:35] 42 47.
[1:53:43] jesus said unto them if god were your
[1:53:46] father
[1:53:47] you would love me
[1:53:53] because jesus is truth if god is your
[1:53:56] father
[1:53:57] you're going to love truth
[1:54:00] for i proceeded forth and came forth
[1:54:03] came from god neither
[1:54:04] came i of myself but he sent me
[1:54:08] why do you not understand my speech
[1:54:11] even because you cannot hear my word he
[1:54:14] said
[1:54:14] ye are of your father the devil now
[1:54:18] he's saying you the devil got his
[1:54:19] children he got
[1:54:21] children and they're going to act just
[1:54:22] like him right
[1:54:24] and the lust of your father ye will do
[1:54:27] he was a murderer from the beginning
[1:54:30] and a bold not in the truth because
[1:54:32] there is no
[1:54:33] truth in him that means he's a liar
[1:54:36] and when he's speaking the lie he
[1:54:38] speaketh of his own
[1:54:40] he makes it up for he is a liar
[1:54:43] and the father of it he started it
[1:54:46] he's the perverter he's a deceiver
[1:54:51] hallelujah and when you believe a lie oh
[1:54:53] i can't do this and i can't do that
[1:54:55] that's nonsense
[1:54:56] when the bible said all things are
[1:54:58] possible to them that believe
[1:55:00] and paul said we are more than
[1:55:02] conquerors through christ
[1:55:03] which strengthens us hallelujah we've
[1:55:05] got to stop
[1:55:06] believing the lie and carrying on like
[1:55:09] we're helpless we're not helpless
[1:55:12] we're acting like moses we all do it
[1:55:16] we all i've done it many times god come
[1:55:19] right around and rebuke me
[1:55:22] why because he's trying to get us to
[1:55:24] understand
[1:55:25] you're the son your daughter you're
[1:55:28] supposed to act different
[1:55:30] if anybody's gonna believe me it must be
[1:55:32] you
[1:55:36] look at the closest
[1:55:41] that's why philippians says 4 he says
[1:55:43] finally brethren
[1:55:48] whatsoever things are true
[1:55:51] what's everything are honest he's
[1:55:54] uncovering the devil
[1:55:55] whatsoever things are just what sort of
[1:55:58] things are pure
[1:55:59] whatsoever things are lovely what's over
[1:56:01] things of a good report
[1:56:03] if there'll be any virtue huh if there's
[1:56:05] going to be strength in you
[1:56:07] if there be any praise think on
[1:56:10] these things
[1:56:14] i'm just going to leave it there but
[1:56:16] what i'm trying to say is that we're
[1:56:17] living in a world
[1:56:18] where lies are influencing everybody
[1:56:22] if you're not careful you'll believe a
[1:56:26] lie
[1:56:31] look at the world it's so perverted now
[1:56:32] why and every
[1:56:34] every perversion is built upon alive
[1:56:39] satan has changed things
[1:56:43] and i believe with all my hard people of
[1:56:45] god you know we've got to come up higher
[1:56:47] it's my mind if we believe that he
[1:56:51] is god he is a rewarder of them that
[1:56:54] diligently seek him
[1:56:57] he will reward you when you approach him
[1:57:01] as god as the rule of all things
[1:57:05] all things is under him you understand
[1:57:08] me
[1:57:08] you approach him like that that's how he
[1:57:11] will receive you
[1:57:12] and he will reward you amen when abraham
[1:57:17] finally came to the conclusion that he
[1:57:20] was god
[1:57:21] that god was god met him
[1:57:25] as melchizedek and said let us have a
[1:57:28] feast
[1:57:31] and they did and then abraham paid his
[1:57:34] tithing
[1:57:35] where did that revelation come from walk
[1:57:38] in the light as he is in the light
[1:57:41] right if you walk into the light you'll
[1:57:43] forget if you're not walking in the
[1:57:44] light your sins can't be forgiven
[1:57:46] how when you walk in the light of here's
[1:57:50] the light
[1:57:51] what he said we have fellowship one with
[1:57:53] another and the blood of jesus christ
[1:57:54] would cleanse you
[1:58:02] excuse me drunk that a little bit too
[1:58:04] fast let's stand
[1:58:06] didn't mean to keep you so long i'm
[1:58:08] excited
[1:58:10] i'm really excited i've been battling
[1:58:15] even since i have made that declaration
[1:58:18] of what i'm
[1:58:18] going to do and i know satan
[1:58:24] he's mad and doesn't like it but he
[1:58:26] can't stop it
[1:58:28] whatever it is he can't stop it you know
[1:58:31] what i'm not guess working i'm not
[1:58:33] guessing whether i'm in the will of god
[1:58:34] i know i'm in the will of god
[1:58:36] and i know because i'm in the will of
[1:58:37] god i make an expectation
[1:58:39] of whatever god is going to show me i
[1:58:42] don't know
[1:58:42] but when i know one thing for certain
[1:58:45] that whatever it is
[1:58:46] it's not only going to benefit me but
[1:58:48] it'll benefit this church
[1:58:50] i just don't want to be what they call
[1:58:54] a message
[1:58:58] i say that all the time i'm so tired of
[1:59:01] that stuff
[1:59:03] i'll never turn my back on this message
[1:59:07] but i won't see it i want to see it live
[1:59:10] and i want to see it live in me you need
[1:59:13] to have a desire to see it live
[1:59:27] he wants you on fire he gonna get you
[1:59:30] from being that he is
[1:59:32] it's okay that means he loves you
[1:59:36] i've had him spank me a couple of times
[1:59:38] let me tell y'all something when i had
[1:59:40] cancer
[1:59:40] that was a real eye opener i wasn't
[1:59:44] afraid of death
[1:59:45] i really wasn't i'm not even now
[1:59:49] but one thing i did it had me
[1:59:50] acknowledged
[1:59:53] in a way i hadn't lived right now
[1:59:57] because i noticed like i told my son
[1:59:59] today
[2:00:00] he's got a gift he called me and he was
[2:00:03] telling me some things
[2:00:07] but the thing i told my son said you
[2:00:09] know what i
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:24] i don't want to go feeling like i'm here
[2:00:26] because feelings can be deceiving
[2:00:29] satan can deceive you right you all
[2:00:32] remember that one lady
[2:00:34] a man who had a husband and left her
[2:00:36] husband
[2:00:38] and then she got venereal disease and
[2:00:40] then she smoked a cigarette and god sent
[2:00:42] a servant of memphis to her to
[2:00:44] tell her you know try to get her right
[2:00:46] i'm just a savior
[2:00:48] and then
[2:00:52] when the veil was
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:07] you'll deceive me you told me this that
[2:01:09] the other where's brother battle
[2:01:10] somebody gonna get brother around
[2:01:12] it was too late
[2:01:15] it's too late we don't go off feelings
[2:01:18] even even when the preacher preached
[2:01:20] check him out
[2:01:22] when i preach check check me out
[2:01:26] make sure what i'm saying is true
[2:01:29] i don't mind being corrected i don't
[2:01:32] [Music]
[2:01:33] if the approach is correct
[2:01:35] [Music]

[2:01:39] and i i
[2:01:41] see my position you don't understand

[2:02:14] have things you have to overcome and be
[2:02:16] delivered
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:26] don't tell me this is perfect it's not
[2:02:28] perfect yet
[2:02:31] and this is where satan gets us right
[2:02:32] here
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:34] but at the end of this it's so beautiful
[2:02:38] to know that god took us this way
[2:02:40] [Music]

[2:02:43] a problem
