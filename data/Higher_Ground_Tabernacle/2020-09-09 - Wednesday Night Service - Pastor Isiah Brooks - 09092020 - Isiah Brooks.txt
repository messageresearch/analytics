appreciate you i'm going to ask that you turn with us by god's grace to matthew the 25th chapter and then we'll come from colossians 1. hallelujah i believe that song will soon be a reality amen we're going to hear him call i believe if you can hear his voice calling you out of denominations and organizations i believe you'll be able to hear his call when he says come up well that's what i'm looking forward to i believe with all my heart that we're not far from that event i really believe that we are in the midst of it and if we're not i'm still going to take the joy of it all and keep running with it matthew 25 and 6. and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him colossians please 1. we'll read the 15th verse who is the image of the invisible god and the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominion or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things are uh consists and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray this evening lord that your perfect will will be done tonight give us the words to speak we come in your name lord jesus we sing in your name we preach in your name we live in your name we pray father god that you would receive us tonight and give us the words to utter that your people may be blessed in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated glad to see everybody here tonight on a rainy cold rainy day i told the lord i said lord you know i'm not ready for winter [Laughter] i can't even take 49 59 50 degrees right now and we all know that it's going to get it's going to drop when it comes but you know by god's grace his grace is sufficient and we so thank god for that we appreciate god giving us the grace to live and you know we look at this thing and i wanted to uh kind of uh give a little thought you know working with the new book and uh my subject would be behold the bridegroom cometh i kind of looked and i looked at the scripture today and i kind of looked on the internet to view what the jews would do for their ceremonial wedding the orthodox jews and i was really impressed i was amazed at the way a jewish wedding is constructed some of the things i will bring out tonight but not all but some of the one of the things that i didn't notice is that they had a ceremony where the bridegroom would break a glass he would put the glass on the floor and he would crush the glass and of course it had several meanings to it but one of the main thoughts that caught my mind was that the glass was to end one life like a single life in that life and of course the woman had to break a plate and of course that was to end her life the old life because now they're getting ready to unite as one and they used simple gold simple gold rings which symbolized of course deity but it also had the meaning of a circle or life that that would be enjoined that would never end and and i thought that was pretty good but one of the amazing things was that you know the brethren dance with the brothers and the sisters danced with the sisters and uh they would they would take uh a platform and they would have that the bride stand on that planned four set on it however and then they would lift her up above the head i thought that was pretty good and uh of course those of us who have a little something we can see what that mean uh and by the grace of god it was a really a wonderful thing and i thought to myself one of the things that that did happen that was quite unusual was that the bridegroom was the one who would put the veil over the bride and you know we normally in our service waiting ceremonies the bride comes in with the veil but here they lead the bride around with the veil on from one station to another and uh it was to see signify that that the groom was no longer interested in her features he was more in love with her character and uh i thought that was pretty good and you know the thing the thing that i also thought about is how um they were always giving secrets or they called blessings and uh the the the the bride had to walk around the groom seven times in a circle now if you're spiritual you'll get a little something and i thought that was awesome you know and you know we we know we come through seven church ages and uh and each parent had the blessed blight and it was wonderful and then the group had to whisper in her ear the contract that he had written out for the bride and i thought that was awesome because my god wrote out his contract too when we think about this message and we talk about uh a wedding and being betrothed or engaged you and i must understand that that's what brother branham did he was like eliza he introduced us to isaac even before we we did see him and he began to tell us all of the things that he uh that uh isaac liked and of course we fell in love with the words of character and that's what the bible is the bible is is the word of god and this word of god is describes the character of god and that's what i was trying to tell somebody i said it's not all the blessings that god has given me all the little you know things that he's done for me and his natural life it's not that's not what i have fallen in love with i have fallen in love with his character and that's the thing that i see in you know when i look at the kind of a man or the prophet that that god sent and he re god jesus christ reflected his character out of him it you know and i understand how sometimes people can't you know distinguish the difference between the two but one of the things that i i know is that uh the way uh the prophet of god handled himself was the character of christ reflecting through him because remember this prophet of i we know in his own nature had a few kinks in there but we find that god so loved us that he sent a prophet after his own heart someone that could really reflect uh christ or through christ could reflect himself through and and we could see god in in a way that denominations and organizations could not see now we understand that the bible has become a new book and and the reason why it's become a new book to the bride is because he's he's he's getting uh how could i say it he wants you to know him we're current in the new book in the new message in the word that god has brought to us in this day we are now beginning to understand jesus christ our lord in a way that we've never known him before now we've known him supposedly as a savior as a healer as a deliverer but i believe that in the portion that we're now uh uh uh how can i say the portion that we're now uh taking part of uh we're learning uh his what it is to be a husband right because the word of god tells us he's not only our savior our deliverer but he is our husband and so now we're learning how a husband is because remember the bible doesn't say where adam was when eve was deceived but one thing i know about my husband he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you he's always there to keep us away from deception now brother branham had actually had some uh supernatural events happening in his life that he fully didn't understand all of a sudden he gradually moved into the revelation of who he was and what he had come to do and the prophet god said uh you know whatever it takes i am going to make that happen i am going to see that my purpose is fulfilled he tells us of a time that him when he was in slovenia canyon and he said while god called me up early in the morning up there i was up with my hands in the air praying and a sword came to my hands you know that i stood there and looked at it just natural as my hand is now not knowing what it meant and it was left in it and it was left me with a voice that said this is the king the sword of the king and then later when the angel of the lord revealed it it was the word in my hand hallelujah so if you can tie this particular quote into the very scripture when john went and took the book out of the lamb's hand then you can understand that there was a a transferring of authority all right and the the transfer of the authority didn't stop with william branham but the bride of jesus christ is told also to eat this book and and and make it part of you in other words it's something that you must dearly eat it's something that you must dearly allow to be a part of you because in this book there is a transforming power all right because remember now we're we're moving into a place of rapture right a changing of the body and the word of god is the only thing that can change your body because the word of god is the quickening spirit right then the prophet god said immediately after that the angels of the lord appeared and told about the seven trumpets or the seven seals that i was returned back here to jeffersonville and preach the seven seals in there and if i ever said anything that was inspired it was that there were those angels of the lord met us and the bible becomes a new book there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was complete revelation of jesus christ all together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture that that was the word which was all always been it was known it was so inspired and directed so he's saying listen i was learning too i was experiencing things i had never experienced before in my life and i came to see that the revelation that i was led into goes exactly with the scripture it was everything the scripture says but understand when we come to the seven seals and the seven thunders remember i read last service amen brother branham said it could not be something added to it had to be there all along because you can't add from the book neither can you take it away from it you'll be cursed so whatever the mystery was it was in the book but yet hidden in the book and so we understand by god's grace the world seen a lot of manifestations pentecostals they see the shouting the dances speaking in tongues but what they don't see they don't see the reality of life right because remember no matter how they appear to be righteous the pharisees appeared to be righteous but they did not have god on the inside matter of fact jesus and john told them that they were dead men bones they appeared to be righteous and holy on the outside and see that's what we're looking at matter of fact when we talk about the organizations and and the denominations is harsh to say it's really it's really a hard thing to say but the prophet of god saw them as a dead corpse and saw the preachers making love to a dead corpse now that was that's the eyes of god and he talked about you know how that that when they then they're lost is because they never had life did you hear what i'm saying they never had life but those that hear my voice he said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow now the word has been opened and what is the word open for it is can i say it like this the word is courting you hallelujah and you're courting the word he you know he knows you but he's he's teaching you about himself and when i saw that young man in in the marriage of this woman he was constantly whispering in her ears and understand the bible says about god whispering secrets into us and this is what god is doing he's literally giving us the secret of himself and he and and in so doing he's identifying who you are because the first human adam ever spoke to was eve amen and the first thing he told her was like you've heard me say where she came from you came out of me bone in my bone flesh of my flesh and all of us know this we've heard these things but let me tell you something don't you ever let this message become common to you the worst thing people can do once they get married is to make them allow their marriage to become common once it becomes common you begin to have problems like they say you're supposed to always try to keep the honey on the moon without the honey on the moon you know what you got a moon full of craters amen so let's move on in the spiritual food industry and i'm saying these things because i'm trying to get to a particular place brother barnum says one day turning to the right and he's talking about the cloud and you wonder why i keep going back to the cloud because this thing means a lot more to me now than it ever had since i've been in this message i see something that have taken place that i didn't see happening before and i see something amen that god is moving in right now and people in the message are missing it they think it was just an event and they don't understand that brother branham constantly kept telling us god interprets his own word hallelujah understand when the seven thunders uttered their voices the bible had already declared time will be no more so basically we're at the end of things we're at the end of things god is interpreting his coming to us we can accept it or we can refuse it but the bible said he will appear to those who love his appearing in other words you'll get a revelation of what this is all about hallelujah the word that comes how many people in them in denomination organization know about what happened in 1963 matter of fact people who were in the message have now downed it and cast it away not knowing that they have sealed their destiny and you and i we we've got something here and what we need to do is really focus on what he's saying to us is that right because this message if it's not changing you something is wrong hallelujah the message comes to change you right when god told abraham you're going to have a baby sarah laughed at it hallelujah but it could not stop god from doing what he said he had already pronounced it and the word of god cannot come back void god said i'm going to have a bribe without spot wrinkle or blemish it's already out there it cannot come back void but what we must find out how and how god will do this thing hallelujah now now watch the promise to abraham and sarah they had they didn't have to do anything for the change to come other than to believe that the change was coming y'all understand me abraham and sarah remain the same but they had an unconditional covenant see this this is not something god wants you to be uh uh uh ringing your hands with and and getting all scared and nervous and and you're thinking making you think oh how i'm gonna do it well let me tell you something to help you tonight there is nothing you can do to do it you can't do it that's why he had to come himself hallelujah he is the transformer is that right when he was at lazarus grave amen he told his uh he told uh mary and martha i am the resurrection i am y'all understand me he said i am the resurrection and that was before pentecost but because of election and because of the predestinated seed and because god had already in his mind thought to raise lazarus from the dead there was no way nothing could stop lazarus from being raised from the dead if he had laid in the tomb 14 days it still would not have stopped lazarus from coming to life once the voice was spoken y'all understand me and last week was un under under uh you say the the lambs and the goats and now the law that's where he was now if the law under the law jesus who is grace and truth can raise you from the dead what about being under grace and truth this should be this is supposed to be a time of triumph this is supposed to be a time where you can shout the victory because you know by god's grace you got the victory you when you get the victory you don't have to feel it hallelujah victory is victory but you ought to rejoice because you have the victory because god has promised you the victory hallelujah it's what god is doing behold the bridegroom coming how many people know that how many people can see that see when he when he actually put his face in the cloud in 1963 that was only for a special group of people it was not for the world they couldn't see it they wouldn't believe it this is his time out for fighting it's time out for uh striving with one another that's nonsense it's not based upon how much knowledge you have of the message it's whether you've got the seed of god in you that's it paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not love it profits you nothing that's what god wants us to have this message is come to to develop and mature divine love in you you say well brother listen god is a god of contrast is that right and guess what he puts you and i in the most evil age ever this is satan's eden and god says i want to see some divine love [Laughter] the darkest of any time of every time i want to see some divine love oh lord i got to have divine love oh lord i gotta divine love oh you know how we do it you know you do a little some nice deed and and something in the back your mind is not agreeing with your deed that's not divine love man he asked me for my last dime divine love don't care about that being the last dime here you go is that right just to exemplify brother said he saw a man with no shoes he went up to the man to measure his shoes to see if the man could fit his shoes he was going to give the man his shoes never thought anything about like i don't have another pair huh but we would think oh my god this is all i got but divine love don't think about stuff like that hallelujah because once you give away good measures pressed down shaking it's going to come running back to you god don't how many of y'all know that's the truth you give somebody something in love and all of a sudden it comes back to you and sometimes twice as much it always happened that's the laws of god but let me move on by the grace of god talk about divine love i'm talking about something that i have fret about i fretted about it because i'm thinking to myself oh god how in the world i'm going to produce divine love with all these distractions all this stuff about me you know you took my distraction plus you got to deal with yourself except the lord builds the house the laborers labor in vain god is the builder not you and so you and i must understand what we must do lord you know what i need see prayer is essential in this hour y'all hear what i'm saying prayer is essential you don't have to feel nothing don't let the devil trick you he might take away the anointing you may not feel it but you got to recognize one thing god said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you he didn't say oh when you feel me to be there i'll be there no he said i'll never do y'all believe that word that's the word it has nothing to do with your feelings hallelujah glory to god he said one day he said talk about the cloud and i'm going back this because i really want he says listen he said there was jesus christ just as perfect as the hoffman ever drawed him he was standing there with a white wig on looking back down toward the earth showing that he is supreme authority the heavens declared it the bible's declared the message declared all the same supreme authority with the white wig on you see his black beard under many of you have seen the picture we got it back there just turn it to the right sideways look at it there he is just as perfect as he was it was it has uh has been uh photographed of him they they're looking at it from the wrong angle you've got to turn it in the right angle and only the lord god can reveal which it is the right angle you turn it to your right and look at it hallelujah now you think about it why was it important for god to show what that was he could have let it go on they could have seen oh he kept calling the seven angels he you know the and and different one the angels of the lord he you know he he named it everything then all of a sudden boo right he saw it was more than that how i mean it's amazing how you know so much can be in one picture hallelujah but you see he's everything he was the seven angels yes sir hallelujah he was the angels of the lord it was god in morphe hallelujah and you see when you begin to see that he's supreme authority hallelujah it makes something happen because i want you to understand who you're marrying i want you to think about this just for a moment who you're marrying who you're becoming part of who you are uniting with not somebody in the trinity some second person or third person recognize who god god has chosen you yeah whoo i almost fell apart just a moment i pulled it back my point is this when you realize amen that you are part of this whole thing and it has been all about you the whole bible has been about you that's why they call this book the book of redemption amen hallelujah he fell god knew that the flesh that we would would be clothed in would fall he ordained it so it could fall because he wanted to love you and you know he got to the place where he he put laws and rules on us to show us that that flesh that you got was going to betray you all every time you can't have confidence in the flesh hallelujah it's going to fail you if you think you're because i'm strong you're not strong and any man in their right mind know you can't live holy without the holy ghost and anyway so he shows you how many times he says a just man falls seven times in a day and he gets up hallelujah david said i'm gonna tell you something i've been into a lot of situations one time i was in a horrible pit but he came and he lifted me up out that pit placed my feet on a rock see that's how it is he'll allow you to even fall into a pit and he'll still pick you up because of who you are and what you mean to him god have mercy on us see the word prepares his bride god prepares his bride and you and i come here and we think oh my god i can't i don't know you know you think to yourself i can see the times times are happening things are happening i don't know when he's coming he's already come he hears he's a hero he's among us he's supernatural he's in spirit we call him the holy ghost right he's here but he wants us to make love to him he wants us that intimacy he wants that fellowship that's why he said walk in the spirit talk in the spirit pray in the spirit sing in the spirit whatever you do spirit spirit spirit in that day you'll know that i'm in the father the fathers at me and i am in you and let me get there because i don't want anybody to think i'm dismissing that we'll meet him in the air but i want you to understand he he if you can get what i'm saying he interprets his own word you got to go with his interpretation and not with what you've been thinking in the past you can't deny that he came in 1963 because the bible declared that he did but the prophet said we will see him right and remember because i'm not going to be long but let me say it like this remember one of the things that that happened in egypt joseph and joseph when joseph began to make himself known to his brethren and you know who his brothers is benjamin and and the others israel and we know that what happened in world war one and world war ii and how god in world war ii brought the jews back to their homeland and that was god the great jehovah bringing them back on eagle's wing prophecy being fulfilled now we see the jews are in their land most of them anyhow but a jew ain't a real jew till they go home and so when those who those orthodox jews that's dead and constantly praying and doing what they need to do before god those are the one god is coming back for but if you understand brother barnum said when that sixth seal was open he said that sixth seal also was open and and like like like how can i say it the seventh seal was open under the six but that seventh seal could not be opened until brother branham came right that was god's seventh angel messenger right but all of the one two three four five six were open is that right otherwise we would not have known the fifth seal we would have known the fourth we wouldn't have known the others but those seals had already happened it was history to us and then with the prophet of god god used him to go back into history and showed us what happened through all those seals and showed us how they overlapped one another now there was a time he said i wanted to preach the trumpets then brother god show brother branham you've already preached the trumpets because the seven seals to us is the seven trumpets to the jews so in is saying all of that so when the six seals were open don't you know over there those jews was being there was a manifestation going on with them and we don't know what it is we weren't there we don't understand it but he also said just like the seventh seal was released he said the seven trumpets would have to be released too so therefore whoever he is moses and elijah we don't know who they are we don't know what's happening there but we do know that at some point in time they will appear now we know this that if they appear while you're here you miss the rapture right because you and i must understand that in between the sixth and the seventh we the bride is supposed to get out of here right so this is a mystery that god heared he's now uh uh uh how i say uh uh loving on you loving on us trying to get us to see the revelation that who we are i'm not talking about your flesh i'm talking about this inside that you that man you that's inside is what god is working with right trauma is trying to tell you that everybody don't get this brother brown said a special class of people a chosen people and elected people are predestinated people right and the thing about it is you do not have to be some great intellectual all you have to do is have faith in what has been said right and god what does god say about abraham abraham staggered not and if you be abraham you stagger not at the promises of god you don't know how it's going to happen and really it ain't your business it's about god and what god chooses to do so anyway he says now listen we meet jesus in the air before we go home get home that's right second thessalonians tells us that for we meet him in the air and a beautiful type of rebecca meeting isaac in the field in the cool of the day we meet him in the air second thessalonians tell us so for we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep and i'm saying something i saw something and i hope i can get a chance to read it where brother branham said now after this word will one day materialize itself it will materialize so you got to eat you got to eat the word and he said one day you'll get so to a place where it will materialize jesus right in front of you this is an individual thing everybody might see the cloud but when it comes to his return it will be an individual thing he will materialize himself in you once you become where he desires you to be and who's bringing you that who's bringing you to that his word that's why he gave it to us he gave us this word so we can have a transformation listen abraham and uh abraham and rebecca did not walk around with a book in their hand they just believed god you understand me and brother brown said that god suddenly changed them from old to young hello because you got to understand this is god's warfare he's not going to tell you everything he didn't tell the prophet everything and when he gets ready to do something he's going to do it right if you've got a dead loved one the prophet god ain't going to say hey you know susie's coming by your house this morning no she gonna come and you're gonna see it right that's what's gonna happen so anyway we look at these things and we say oh brother brooks uh there's something wrong knows nothing wrong with me you know i look at these things and i say to myself you know when we begin to really look at this world seriously we'll begin to see that there it brings change now i don't know about you there's a change happening in me and i know it's happening because the things that's changing is things that i could not have changed on my own and we he goes on and says listen for we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air perfect all these types you guys can smile tonight and you can say amen if you like it therefore the theophany if you have died and entered into theophany what happens that theophany comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you heal on in the air you take the body to meet the theophany there you are and caught up and go to meet the lord in the air he said who is this mechadeck but god now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely the stages of eternal purpose he had his secret has now been revealed notice there is still stages to to perfection now i'ma stop right there he said his secret has been revealed and what is his secret he comes back to return he comes back for his bride hallelujah but he knows he can't bring her where he's going in the condition she's in so he knows that there's got to be a change it has to be a change now you know you can't think that you're going to just you know you go god going to catch you in a bar room and rapture you it ain't happening right so the power of the word must be active in your life it can't be something just in your head it has to be active in your life literally changing you from glory to glory right and that change will continue watch as the days go on it's literally going to speak uh speed up and the reason why it's going to speed up is because we're going to have pressure he's going to help us speed up right because the squeeze is coming the pressure is coming and it will help us speed up right now we're not like the organizations and denominations they think that they will be secured in their churches that's what israel said well you don't hear his titus let us go back to jerusalem let's run into the temple and they missed the message of the hour jesus said to his disciples when you see the the city encamped about with with the armies don't go back to your house if you're in the field stay out there if you're on the mountain stay out there never go back in and they did right and it got so bad the prophet god said they were eating their own children hello i'm gonna tell y'all something you think america is exempt from that they know i mean they might be doing that kind of stuff now this is an evil wicked wicked wicked and whatever the devil can get them to do he's going to get them to do it and a lot of us we don't even think about those things and maybe i'm just out of my mind but what happens to 800 000 children that disappear every year you know it's something to that but my point is this they have all kinds of movies zombies and all that i don't watch that nonsense but my point is this they're introducing people into eating flesh hmm this civilized uh a world is now being introduced not you know it wasn't not enough to just kill each other but now they're killing and eating now i'm gonna move on because that sounds pretty rough but my point is folks i just don't trust folks i don't i don't now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives and our journey and our death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely maybe y'all don't know but my wife says well i'll come back on the bus i said oh no you're not coming back on the bus if you come back home i'll come back and get you if i got a i've got a uh you know yeah if i got to rent a car y'all forgot just a few years ago the man would sleep over there in canada at the bus stop this man was on something not only did he kill the man but he started eating the man right on the bus this is this is facts man would sleep down in uh down there in in florida a homeless man and some man come up and start eating all his flesh real people it's a reality and when you see things like that it's like a like drops of rain before the storm you do not want to be here if the rapture should take place that's why people are going to try to kill themselves and death is going to flee from them right let me say it like this if you have ever seen movies or videos of the holocaust and what those germans and everybody else did to the jews i want you to understand those the same demons the same demons that's loosed y'all understand me that's going to torment everybody that misses the rapture and whatever they did to the jews will be like child play compared to what they're going to do with those who are left behind and that's what people don't understand folks in the message que sera sarah whatever would be will be if i am if i am predestinated then he's going to do it wrong attitude wrong you'll miss it a hundred miles uh more than that if that's your attitude to him that knowing that too good and doeth not to him is sin now we see his plane is the complete secret of our journey right the stage of eternal purpose he had in the secret has now been revealed notice there is still three stages to perfection just like he redeemed the world same way he redeemed his church he redeemed the people three stages now look first is justification like luther preach second wesley sanctification right wesley third is the baptism of the holy ghost then comes the rapture right but you see what happened is in the pentecostal age they they redefined the baptism of the holy ghost and gave it a false description or definition everybody thought that they received they were receiving the holy ghost because they were speaking in tongues and the pentecostals became blind when they made the evidence of speaking in tongues the holy ghost and you know what they did they opened the door for devils because devils amen speak in tongues so they were able to filtrate the pentecostal world by doing so hallelujah and look at them now right but then god brought a prophet who told us amen what the holy ghost is given for and what it really is and how to know when you got it hallelujah you don't need nobody to tell you you got the holy ghost when you get the real holy ghost you know that you know that you know hallelujah amen and that's what people don't understand they said well they got it on the day of pentecost but you understand they were through jesus for three and a half years and you know what before they could get the holy ghost they had to be sanctified because jesus sanctified his eye i breathe on you and he sanctified him through his breath and his word so when they got on the pentecost they didn't they didn't need to clean up they were already cleaned up right and then the holy ghost don't think god's gonna come into you and and you still living unclean no it ain't gonna happen no help us lord jesus now the world how did he redeem the world the first way y'all know how these things so i'm gonna go head on now at midnight and how many of y'all know we're beyond midnight hello hallelujah when brother branham came it was midnight is that right but then when he preached the dawning of a new new uh day star right the rising of a sun amen he he began to tell us the dispensation is changing it's no longer midnight right it's the dawning of a new day the day star the north star that star is shining but remember before the full day break it is darkest before dawn hallelujah and then he preaches us and tells us there's a man who could turn on the light what was he telling the bride he was telling the bride it's going to get so dark you are you will be frightened fear not little flock it is the father's good pleasure the pleasure to give you what the kingdom but he's telling you it's going to get so dark but don't be afraid there's a man who can turn on the light is that right the same one who turned it off it's the same one who turns it on hallelujah amen what is it we're coming into the very image and likeness of god coming into a place we didn't know how adam was did we but we saw jesus and we didn't know how we would be what we saw a prophet william branham you understand me the dark ages had to be from from all the way from paul's or ephesus age all the way up to our age you see it had to be dark there was real no real vision everything had been eaten away by the palmer worm the cake worm the locust and the caterpillar and the word could not be restored until god sent the prophet y'all see what i'm saying y'all understand what i'm saying had not god sent him we would be in darkness to this day because god had already ordained his system according to amos 3 7 god will do nothing except he revealed it to his servant as a prophet so we needed him and when people when people reject the messenger they literally willfully places themselves back into darkness they love darkness that's right the bible said evil men love darkness more than light coming into that image you and i can't even fathom it brother i can't but i believe it i can't imagine amen being just like jesus in every respect but i believe it i know it's possible because god says so right going on you say well what do you mean you're wondering why man is is it the way he is because god made him that way brother said now when when when when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on earth he gave him jurisdiction over everything on earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the fowl life the fish of the sea he controlled the wind he controlled the plant life he controlled everything man was made a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things all elements on earth that was adam adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to to make himself is where he fell so what are you saying now here it is the seals are open we didn't know you know i don't know about y'all but i came through the domination of churches and you know you always just hope that god will save you you know because everything was working with law you know what i mean if you messed up you was really condemned right and god came in his last day and said that is not how it works your covenant is not law your covenant is grace you got to believe this now you can't you can't you can't make heaven without believing this because satan gonna make you make mistakes he'll gonna trip you at times but you got to understand with all that tripping he he he do to you you're still perfect he's not the man who's judging you god is judging you perfect as long as the holy ghost is in you god has judged you perfect are you ready for heaven right now hallelujah see and you got to understand amen so god we understand that adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife and it would obey him he could speak to the waters if ever what he was everything obeyed him now you think brother man if you think god just got this in here huh what do you think is in here for you think god just put it in here well i'll just give them this something to make them feel good fundamental faith the fundamental foundation faith perfect this is what he put that in there so you can know when the squeeze comes if you're in the image and likeness of god everything is at your disposal we don't care about the electronics we don't care if they can say oh i see where he's at or he can't run his heat the body of his heat giving him away that has nothing to do with us that's a natural thing they working with hallelujah but my father was able to walk through doors y'all understand what i'm saying he was able to walk on water he was able to translate philip y'all understand what i'm saying the bible is real it's it's open to it's no longer a history book it's a book of instructions it's a book that god is trying to get us to see and to understand amen what is available for you and me that's why he has it there now how can he let this man preach this thing if it wasn't for us well why you might as well throw mark 16 out if you're not going to believe this this word is real very real hallelujah you try it ask god you know you you you say uh how can i say it all god all the lord told uh uh in the word says whatsoever you say [Music] do you think you just got to have a visitation from the angel every time you come to a conflict one day one day my little boy isaiah like that he was just little and uh he was going in the back into the in the refrigerator that says no don't you go in that refrigerator and he said daddy why can't i go in the refrigerator you go in there from that day on he was able to go in the refrigerator why because i realized he was mature enough to know what he wanted inside that's what god is looking for he's looking for us to mature and stop looking at him to do things that we supposed to be doing on our own if you led by the spirit you are the sons of god you say well oh brother listen jesus was standing right there and he rebuked his disciples because they did not rebuke the wind they did not rebuke the storm what were they waiting on he said i've already given you power i've given you the authority and here you allowing the elements of the earth to get the best of you peace be still and you need to turn around and rebuke them for having no faith little faith oh ye of little faith where did you doubt huh they could say oh we was waiting on you jesus and jesus said but i was waiting on you i've given you the authority to do this thing why are you doubting it bride of jesus christ god has given us so much authority and yet we're walking around like underprivileged children you know what that stands for upc that's what we're doing and you know that's we're beyond that this is not a pentecostal message this is a message of authority this is the real tree putting back the real tree putting forth another branch you either a branch that's coming from the real tree or you're a hybrid you got to believe i'm from the original branch that's what god has come to do he's come to get us that's why i said don't let it be don't think it's not robbery to be equal with god right don't think he you see that's what the devil the devil we fear for if i take a challenge if i take that on then then then i'm almost blasphemy and i'm trying to make myself god no you're not trying to make yourself god it's the god in you that's trying to be made manifest hallelujah i've seen things i've seen things i've seen god talk to me and say things and i say it and every time i think i can't do it that's when god wants me to do it oh it's true it's true it's true what happened you know it talks about when when when god went to get rebecca she she was blood related to isaac somebody help me here you said see what made you move what made you come to this message the only thing you could have why do you think he put that in there he put it in there and he brought out the fact that rebecca was related to isaac that's why she moved there was something pulling her the same bloodline that's what got you in the message why do you doubt it you couldn't even hear this except the blood of christ was in you somewhere you represent christ and he represents you you've got there's a relationship here he could have gotten another woman but he says don't go among the canaanites don't get none of that go over here where your realities are all right the blood and the reason why we can hear this message because that same blood was applied before the foundation of the world right now is now expressing what god did for you back there right god's thoughts don't evolve people when god's thoughts see you he sees you right he don't see oh the eyes the hair no all of a sudden we can't explain it but god starts to revolve i got a quote on that when he see you you say well i was just a thought but when you as a thought you was in your perfection when he saw you hallelujah he chose you and i don't know why we think you know we're still acting strange like we chose him i came to jesus you came to jesus because he called you you would have never found your way right unless the father draw you it's christ the spirit god drawing you drawing us right notice god compromise come pro com god promised in his word that he would choose his bride by his original way he chose uh his he chose his see the bridegroom he he foretold it by the prophets and sent a prophet to identify it the prophet says standing on the bank of jordan behold see you're the messiah aren't you he said no i'm not the messiah you must be the messiah but i'm not him but he is standing among you and his shoes i'm not worthy to loosen when he comes make himself known see and today he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church and making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same making himself known and one day you'll see that one you're filled in your heart here it is see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one did somebody take a flash at this ceiling flash okay i want to make sure it's not it did to me the other day and i'm like wow is that real or okay so we look at this thing and you say well what do you mean you've united by the word and the word was in the beginning we'll go back to the beginning which is god that word means meditate on that meditate on that get your natural mind out of the way and meditate on that you're a part of god and you go back to god oh mercy jesus that's too much to even my mind about to explode i mean they think about it i'm just not saying these things but when you think about where you're going this miserable life that you know how much i hate this world this miserable life your life ain't miserable mine is as long as i wear this coat my life is miserable the inside i've got joy but other than that this old man if i could peel him off i would come on folks you all know he'd give you trouble you can get in the mirror and grooming it and still ain't good enough right still ain't good enough but that's the way it is you can't never satisfy the flesh because this flesh represents satan you're invited to the word you're not united by the word and the word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is god and that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me and i and you and you and me you got to know that and that's what this bible is this word is bringing us to to the reality that we are not a you didn't get here by chance this didn't come by some fake mistake false no it was pre-planned now this is the part you need to see you're at the top of the tree you're the crooks you the what's that what's that uh word i'm trying to look for the the the the height of it all you said i i uh yeah the pinnacle i don't know about that well let me say like this after all of that battling armageddon all kinds of stuff that went on then then after all that crazy stuff is going on i call it crazy but god in his own wisdom made it just that way john says behold the bride the lamb's wife she have made herself ready and then when she comes down she's descending and her glory is the glory of god you and i don't even know what that means it's more than what we call illumination it's the very essence of god his glory and every stone in the city has a story whatever jewel it may be sapphire crystal diamond whatever there's a story behind it where somebody got a victory somebody triumph over the devil right and you'll go through your home and your mansion or whatever it is and every little piece of it will tell your story hallelujah testimony throughout eternity you know that and the thing that i say is this when the lord came in the cloud not the way the world thought it would be but the way he manifested himself the way he interpreted his own word there's a time he will come and the bible said all eyes will see him but that is not a good time especially for the non-believer and the make-believer but now he's coming to translate us and change us the thing that i'm looking for i'm looking for the change i'm expecting to change and i'm realizing that god is in me he put himself in me he accepted me and then i accepted him his pregnancy came by his own will and not mine see because brother said jesus christ is choosing his own bride just the same as excuse me men choose their brides today and the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride ye have not chosen me understand that we hear it all the time ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you [Music] now according to the word of god the bride was chosen from the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9 and in romans 9 11 that the purpose of god according to election might stand this is why i want to encourage people you may be at home you may be somewhere the bible said when you see the day approaching come together the more now he just god is not just telling you that for no purpose he can talk to you at his home but god loves fellowship he loves to see his people gather together and i marvel at the people that do not come to church when they can come to church because i think and i think within myself they don't see the hour we're living in there is no way you can see that the time is at hand and you fail to come to church like i don't understand that because i'm gonna tell you something it doesn't matter if the majority of the people don't come the bible says where two or three are gathered i'm there in the midst wherever jesus is i want to be and with all of the lockdown that we've been having you think people would have been flocking but nothing has changed with most but i want to encourage the people that who've been coming you've been you've been you've been you've been sacrificing don't stop this is not a time to quit god is doing something whether you see it or not i know he is i believe that with all my heart because i know what i'm going through i've been feeling strange very strange for several weeks now and i can't even explain it but i know something's moving and i want to be part of it and i believe that i am you love the lord i'm just going to stop right there but he's coming behold the bridegroom coming i'm a little tired in my body but i'm okay i'm not sick or anything but i want to say by god's grace that you and i must understand look up for your redemption drawers now why are you telling us to look up because that's where the cloud was look up your redemption draws nine don't don't let this hour slip away one of the worst things can possibly happen to any of us is that we're left behind and i really believe that if the bride if you're bride there's a pool in your life right now there's a pool people it may be a little small little thugs but it's there it's there and so take advantage of that don't let it die keep moving forward in jesus name let's stand i'm so glad that god shattered my past i'm so glad that my past mean nothing to him that's that's he's not looking at what i used to do or even what i used to be all that's behind and all he's doing now is whispering sweet stuff in my ears i don't know whether i had this dream last night or this morning because i talked with a brother but that was one of the things that inspired this message and all i know is that we were preparing ourselves brother paul was in it his daughters were in it and we were preparing ourselves for this wedding and i ain't never seen brother propose jumping shouting and dancing and he was jumping and shouting and dancing and so i i did a little something myself but my point is this it was something grand it was something really great and and all i could hear when i woke up was behold the bride and that's why i got where i got this message from because i believe that god showed me that for a particular reason and i i believe with all my heart and i can't say it i can't make a person believe the bible jesus christ can't get you believe nobody can but i do know that the hour is late and i trust that everybody will make sure that their lamps have been is [Music] lord jesus thank you for your grace [Music] side we rebuke it we rebind it in the name of jesus christ and we curse it and we commend that devil that's occupying it to release her right now in the name of jesus christ hallelujah by the authority of the word not my word lord it's your word you commanded us to do it thus we have done so thank you for your victory lord thank you for your glory thank you for your victory thank you for delivering her thank you for healing her lord thank you father for for ministering to his children in these times now lord and i pray father through all of this you'll cause their heart to turn toward you bless them now in jesus christ's name bless our brother king give him the strength the eyes the ears amen to know what your will is in this play in this part granted now in jesus christ [Music] [Music] sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirits [Music] my rest is completely when i see his feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul [Music] sweep over my soul sweep over [Music] sweep over my soul [Music] sweet
