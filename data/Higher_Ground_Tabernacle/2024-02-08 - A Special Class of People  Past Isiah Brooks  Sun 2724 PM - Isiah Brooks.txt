out God is good to us am we thank the Lord for this day giving a testimony my sister-in-law my S my bed amen had what happened he vacated the house he had to get out the prayer of a righteous man availeth much and my brother is a prayer Warrior he said I can't explain to you how happy I am that God would Grant my wife and [Music] I more years together here on Earth I told her while she would while she she's here I I would give her space and time to show you the doctor's graphs where she was and where she is now the thing about it is the doctor even said she's like one in a million whatever this thing was amen God took it out so I know God is still a miracle working Hallelujah and I've never seen him fail because there is no failure in him 1 Peter 2:9 says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of of Darkness His Marvelous Light Jesus I'll never forget what You' done for me Matthew 13 appreciate the song service I tell you what the preaching and the singing has been really getting Gooden the presence of the Lord is in this place Matthew 13 it's going to be a lengthy scripture reading from 34 to 44 so bear with us all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will were utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sth them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burned into the fire so shall it be in the end of this world so the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity I want you to take notice to that particular scripture the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity so there is a separation of those who are of his kingdom Hallelujah they shall cast him into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their father who have ears to hear Let Him hear the Kingdom of Heaven is liken to to treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he had and by that field let us pray father God we come come before you Lord humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for this time and opportunity to come before you Lord we pray that you would give us grace mercy Lord to move completely out of your way that you have preeminence tonight speak to our hearts Lord sow the seed in a good ground that we may bring forth a 100 fold help us now Lord Lord because we we need you the word of God is life to us forgive us for anything we may have said or done that would hinder this service Lord have th Own Way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated um I I know you've heard this term before the prophet of God tell tells us that we are a special class and that's my subject tonight we're living in such a horrible world and Satan uh purpose is to wear the Saints out and according to the scriptures the Bible said that the of people means that you're not just ordinary you have been set aside for a particular purpose a special purpose uh if you if you if you if you ever fly on a plane you have several different classes the poor people like me we we we normally sit in the back and they call that the economy class and uh then you have like a a main cabinet or something like that yeah that class main cabinet but then there is that first class the first class is treated differently well it's it's only right because the price that's paid to fly in first class it's different from the price of the economy and the main and of course the greater the price the greater the reward is that right so we understand that in this last day there is a people that will pay a great price I read the scripture I read the parable when the individual found a pearl in the field he purchased the whole field to buy the Pearl in other words he gave up all that he had uh to hold fast to the the Pearl that he had the riches wasn't the field the richest was the Pearl in the field often times people think it's the field that's who were not of the special class uh when we look at Jesus disciples they may have come from a rough background many of them look like the many of them look like the scum of the Earth but in the eyes of God they were a special class of people uh they were a people that God knew be before the foundation of the world I mean just like he told Jeremiah before you were even formed in your mother's womb I knew your mother's womb knew every single person who were in the mind of God hallelujah as Sons and Daughters they have an eternal security they can never be lost Hallelujah and you say why would you say that because Jesus said Lord I've I haven't lost one Hallelujah and the and Judas wasn't really mine but everyone that you gave me is still mine see that's the way God works he doesn't give you eternal life and then take it back Hallelujah hallu eternal life is not based upon your righteousness eternal life is based upon his righteousness Hallelujah and only God can give you that righteousness I heard the prophet of God say today uh in a message uh uh and he was saying I don't ask for God righteousness he said I ask for God's mercy and Grace hallelujah hallelujah and I said to myself Hallelujah that's exactly right Hallelujah I ask for his mercy and Grace Hallelujah you understand me because it's so easy to get confused in the field of righteousness you understand me because we can think that we're righteous and the things that we do is righteous but the Bible said our righteousness is as filthy R Hallelujah and so in order to get the righteousness of God you got to approach the throne of grace you got to ask God for his mercy and his grace in order to receive a robe of righteousness Hallelujah that comes through humility see the secret is this the truth of the word is hidden from the world they can't see you know most snakes if not all see they feel with their tongues vibration they're blind but their eyes look like they're wide open and that's the way John saw those Pharisees in that day he said you Generation of Vipers you looking right at me but you can't see who I am you're looking right at Jesus you can't see who he is you're looking at the skies you're Discerning all the things and signs but you don't have the the ability to discern the time and season that you're living in right now hallelujah hallelujah but God has never left himself without a witness there have always been a special class hallelujah hallelujah God has always had a people that can see the hour and the time that they're living in there's always been a people that can recognize the Messiah when the world can't see hallelujah hallelujah think about it all Abraham had to do was believe the word and the Bible said God imputed it to Abraham is righteousness Hallelujah there's only one per man that's Jesus Christ himself hallelujah hallelujah but because we believe in our sacrifice because we believe he's the sacrifice because we believe he's a perfect one hallelujah our belief is imputed unto us as righteousness it doesn't mean that you're going to live an ungodly life but when you are truly born again try to live as close to God as you Poss can Hallelujah but when you fail when you come short the blood of Jesus still prevails the blood of Jesus still covers [Music] Us this blood is an eternal Covenant of God yes sir glory to God Luke 10 L 21 10 21- 24 hallelujah hallelujah we we we we looking at and we must know these things keep them in our hearts and our minds if you don't Satan is going to wear you out yes that's true hallelujah hallelujah he's going to wear you out I know what I'm talking about hallelujah hallelujah just as soon as you get your eyes and your mind off the word ground we must learn how to give thanks in all things how to give thanks in all things okay amen Luke 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit I thank thee oh Father Lord Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed themto babies even so father for so it seemed good in th side let me tell you something Jesus disciples him for three and a half years and still didn't know who he was because they were drawn by way of election they were drawn to the voice of God my sheep hear my voice and will not follow so they follow Jesus for and half years they cast out Devils they were out on the street preaching they still didn't have the Holy Ghost you can follow Jesus for a long per time before getting the Holy Ghost know that the Holy Ghost is a promise the B said repent in the name of Jesus remission of your receive the know about you everybody can't see thisall if you elected of God will open your eyes hallelujah hallelujah think about it they didn't even know who Jesus was he had to ask the question say I the son of man and only one of them knew who he was by Revelation you talking about a special class of people none of them had their d ddds none of them were theion and fisherman Hallelujah but that's who God reveals himself toall he HS himself from the wise and The Prudent Hallelujah is that what he said in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth thou has hid these things from the wise in The Prudent and has revealed them unto babies so father for so it seemed good in that sight for father so it seemed good in that sight all things are delivered to me of my father no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son somebody and to whom the son will what hallelujah hallelujah you can look right at the scripture and still beind hallelujah hallelujah why because the letter kill it the spirit give life the Church of the Living God is built upon a revelation Hallelujah glory and Upon This Rock Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and he turned and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are your eyes now I'm telling you something the word is speaking to you blessed are your eyes which seeth these things that you see hallelujah hallelujah he said but I tell you that prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you and have not seen them and to hear those things you hear and have not heard them what do you say secrets that God held and God kept in secret because the foundation of the world is now unfailing himself un in the Mysteries according to the Book of Revelation to the of Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm saying special class thank you Lord thank you Lord amen think about it Cain could not see the truth the truth was preached to him by God God said go do exactly what your hallah and I will grant you the victory Hallelujah I'll make you rule over him that devil should have known if he could only have been obedient he would not have fight he didn't wouldn't have to fight for this thing to him right there God knew he was not here he have eyes to see he was a serpent help me somebody you I see you can see it and because you can see it it classifies you as a special class Esau could not see the truth see the importance of the birthright Hallelujah but Jacob though he was a Shar he was a schemer he was a trickster on the inside there was a seed of God hallel hallelujah before we got saved everything the children of raed but on the inside there was a seed hallelujah hallelujah a special class of people a certified seed yall hear me a genuine seed a seed that couldn't be h was in the inside of all of us attraction that's why you are attracted to the word something that's in you that's telling you this is the truth not be able to live it Hallelujah to God yes sir glory to God RAB a prostitute could see the god of Israel she knew it was the God all of those statues and Idols they had in Jericho when about the God of Israel she already heard what Israel did in Egypt the she departed Hallelujah Jero they don't now they've heard the history but now the the the the the history has become a reality because now that same Army of people that walk through the Red Sea is now walking through the Jordan you better hear what I'm saying this is why the scriptures say the hearts of the the of Jericho melted they knew they were defeated before they were defeated Hallelujah but in the in in the midst of all that God had a special class there was a seed of God in Jero by the name of RAB God don't care about the life that you live here have sin comes we all sin of the glory of God hallelujah but thank God for election for election predestination Hallelujah right but the said God hand picked you Hallelujah I want this one that one this one that oh my God don't you understand in my family to witness too they can't see it Hallelujah but thank God for these thank God for the eyes that God me that God is to [Applause] God I don't wonder about him Hallelujah is that all right RAB a prostitute when all of Jero was dind to the god of is what about the woman with the issue of blood the phares and the Sadducees trying to figure out who Jesus was by Revelation by Revelation this this man is the Son of God and she said oh but if I can just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole see we do as people as as a special class we do some strangest things because when you're led by the spirit help you do strange things you can't explain it sence science can't explain it but when you know that you know that you know that you know that God is leading you to do something of everybody else hallelu no doubt the devil fought that woman pretty stupid crawling down here on the ground trying to get a hold of jesusall she she wasn't worried about getting a hold of all of them said if I can just touch the him of his G do y know where the hill is down there she had to be hum down to get there hum herself to get there way is now you God you got to humble yourself hallelujah hallelujah she said if I could just touch it I'll be made whole now you said what a minute wait a minute Jesus wait a minute Jesus wasn't even told by God she was coming hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there was no scripture she could read but there was an inspiration that's what people don't understand those animals that was on the ark there was a special class of animals about it they couldn't read or right they didn't know nothing about science but there was an inspiration hallelujah hallelujah that led them into the so will it be the Rapture inspiration that will make us know is hallu it won't be anything so written it be revealed to those who are in the you say well what do you mean it the Bible said that John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day in the spirit on the Lord's day and he was reveal the whole book of Revelation so when you're in the spirit it's no telling what God is going to reveal to you this is why the devil tried to keep us caral because the caral mind receive the spiritual that's true hallelujah hallelujah what about the blind man I'm coming on blind man from birth had a better eyesight he had a better eyesight than all the religious people of his Hallelujah a question who healed you and basically calling Jesus a devil and this man had so much wisdom it's not even written in your law God never ever healed blinded eyes Hallelujah say what you want to say about it but one thing I do know I was once blind now I see hallelujah hallelujah and we know that only God Open the Eyes of the Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah now I'm moving on Hallelujah you got to understand that we are rejoicing but there is a power an antichrist power and this Antichrist power has been given the power to deceive the whole world all of the world except those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life thank you for your word Lord yall understand me now y'all should be jumping by now the reason why I'm not trying to make you jump but what I'm trying to tell you is that because of your special class because God has revealed himself to you in this last day how can it how can you receive the mark of the beast listen if you got the Holy Ghost you can't receive it because you've already been mocked by the hoost hear me you can't be mocked by the Holy Ghost but when you mocked by the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ has been applied it doesn't it ain't about your righteousness his thank you Lord Abraham didn't come to God came to Abraham Hallelujah you never came to God hallelujah hallelujah no one can resist him Antichrist now no one who can resist him except those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life because we have the knowledge of who he is and the Bible says my people are destroyed because of the lack of knowledge but God has given us knowledge he given us a revelation not only of the person of the of the Antichrist but he's given us knowledge of the spirit an Hallelujah he said that Spirit of the Antichrist coming to the church and make it powerless hallelu it will defile the church itall you know all the fruits of the spirit of God will be abent there hallel they have a name that they live

Hallelujah Darkness don't hang out with light light don't separate yourself the word of God they going to think you crazy anyway all you got to do is talk about Jesus and they'll leave you alone

come yet and Dreadful day is now hallelu it's great for the Bride of Jesus Christ and it's dreadful for the unbeliever Hallelujah and he shall what he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and heart of the children to their fathers L I come and smite the Earth with the curse Hallelujah that means how can you get rid of Pentecost how can you get rid of the Pentecostal experience Hallelujah this generation is to returned back to that Pentecostal experience I'm not talking about just speaking in tongues I'm talking about jumping and shouting none of that is the evidence how they say the the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost you can do all of that and still not have it God change you hallelujah hallelujah and that's what people don't believe they don't understand when God changes you when you become uh you you're born you a baby hallelujah hallelujah but often time people want oh i' I've been oh I got it I been and then when they fall when they come short they don't understand you're a baby you born a baby not a man you to be a man you got to up into Christ Hallelujah and that comes through sufferings that comes to trials that comes through prayers amen but God don't throw you away when you stumble and fall your experience was real amen and and if it's real you couldn't get away from it if you tried because he that begun the good work he he he he to complete it I'm almost done the designation of a special class of people and we're protected by election amen that's true yeah you didn't choose God God chose you your election was before you were born is that right the Bible says in the Book of Revelation your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life Foundation the world so God divinely elected you and chose you hallelujah hallelujah and that is your destiny Hallelujah is that that's the truth amen Jeremiah say I Ain preaching no more I'm tired of these stiff people amen Jeremiah thought he could stop see you can't stop when fire on all of a sudden that little that that revelation of who God is and everything God has done you see the Holy Ghost something else he'll Stir It Up Jeremiah says I got to preach fire set up in my how try to quit the message but the message can't quit you the Mage hallelujah hallelujah when God gave you the Holy Ghost he took that that very message and it in your heart hallelujah hallelujah not in your head he said this is I think the church ages he said you will you will remember you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book was we we are studying is actually the revelation of Jesus in the church and his works in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation we will fail to get it hallelujah hallelujah bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real see the intellectual they can take that Bible and they can prove to you by the Bible there are three Hallelujah but Revelation reveals that the three are not three persons one person revealed in three offices hallu I am a father I'm a preacher I'm a pastor I'm one person I function three different manners hallelujah hallelujah but my name is Isaiah BR so is it with God God in creation father he was God in son Hallelujah Jesus he God is the Holy Ghost working in the church today Hallelujah but his name is the Lord Jesus Christ one God three offices hallelujah hallelujah yeah yeah yeah they going to come after you for that hallelujah hallelujah they were they were considered Heretics when they believed in one God hallelujah but if they watch it and see where that three Trinity came it came from ba worship it came from ba worship inste they brought all of those Creeds Traditions into the work into the into the church what scares me about a lot of countries they want their traditions church and they don't know that these things are the things that the word of God it of n it did it then and it does it now am amen hallelujah the tradition of the elders it got so bad to ask Jesus why you don't wash your [Music] hands yeah cuz they took that as the word traditions and they tried to correct the word with the Trad the word comes to correct the tradition y oo God help us Jesus Lord have mercy Lord it is going to take operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class do you see yourself hallelujah hallelujah listen let me tell y'all something you better remember the types and the types and the Shadows they tell the truth hallelujah it wasn't that many that made the rapture when Enoch and we declare that we're the Rapture age many hallelu but in the tribulation there was eight you know eight Souls no in his family Hallelujah had to go through the Great Tribulation hear what I'm saying even though they were saved they remain on Earth am when Enoch was in Heavenly Place hallelujah hallelujah so will it be the of Jesus Christ would take a Rapture but the foolish virgin will remain here and when they die it's going to take a thousand years before they come up [Music] again hallelujah hallelujah it would take one one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from God it would require the supernatural Instructions Not Just of a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the Holy Spirit it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know Hallelujah can I go on as I have already said this book re this book Revelation is the consummation of the Scripture it is even placed exactly right in the Canon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hear it is blessed it is the revelation of God that would give you authority over the devil now he didn't say power he said Authority there's a difference between Authority a king could be sick on a bed strength but that being sick with no strength doesn't change his authority his word when going when it goes out it must come it cannot come back vo cannot change the order amen hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it will have to be so can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God overcome the enemy this is why everything has become social a social club there there no power having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof Hallelujah just just give me a few more minutes hallelujah hallelujah it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word a blessing is pronounced those who give special attention I think this refers to the Old Testament of the priest reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as it was the word the blessing was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard Hallelujah you love the Lord I'm I'm going to cut it short but I just want to say by the grace of God God is interested in everything that's wrong everything that you anticipate in every Walk of Life God is interested in you you are his child and he is rich in Mercy he wants to do for for you and often time we think God is there to send us straight to hell but God is there to give you his mercy God is there to give you his grace that's why he saved you not to lose you Hallelujah he cannot lose you even like he said about Israel hallelujah how can I forget you how can I lose you I've got you written in the palms of my hand Hallelujah but we were even in a better place we were in the mind of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of Christ Is Now hidden in Earth and vessels Hallelujah I'm just going to leave it there hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus said in this in that word St John 1420 he said at that day you shall know that I am in my father ye in me and I in you let's stand amen thank you Lord thank you Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah what was that
