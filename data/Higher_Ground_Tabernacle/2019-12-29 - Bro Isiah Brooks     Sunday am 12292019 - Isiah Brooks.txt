that's what we are undeserving [Music] amen as we we have a sister that really needs our prayer today amen Satan has afflicted hurry so we're trying just to get y'all warmed up so the atmosphere would be good where Jesus is God always do things and as our brother Troy said this morning where two or three are gathered in his name there he is in the midst let's find a word of Prayer dear Jesus how sweet and lovely is your name there is none other like you and father we thank you for those who gave those who've had a desire to give bless them both Lord bless your ministry Lord here anoint your people break and destroy the yokes of the enemy Lord we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated as we were saying it's good to see our sister God is so good to us man we're glad to see everybody here today amen so I won't forget brother Maurice we'll speak with you after service you're not in trouble no brother Maurice that's okay yes okay God is good to us amen and we just love the Lord they were supposed to be baptism today I don't see the sister but God knows and we're praying for the sick afterwards by God's grace before I get into the message I'd like to say that we're getting ready to embrace a new year and I don't know about you but I want to be a better Christian this coming year than I was the year before I want to get to a place where there's no difference between me and my lord so I desire your prayers pray for me and I'll pray for you that God's perfect will be done the reason why we're having the New Year's Eve service down and Iowa City only because I asked I told them last year when we traded up that we we had it here last year and I told him we would switch it up and so they'd brought that to my memory and that's the reason why we're having the service down there but from this point on if the Lord Terry we'll just have it here and they would have to migrate this way because it's a bigger place so those of you who can make it on the 31st down there for the services they start the service start at 10 have testimonies if you like whatever God places on your heart songs but we come to have a glorious time and this is it won't be a funeral service we're coming to have a glorious time and we want people to have their Liberty like I told them you could shout dance and whatever more you want to do because God has brought us a mighty long way coming from the scripture you may stand now I'd like to read three passages of scripture and I come from first Timothy 6:15 see that our sister they all missed you hanging in there I think we should be the most happiest people in the world and but the Frank is going to pass out some headsets someone would assist him especially seeing the time that we're living in I believe that we are at the closing of everything I believe the message I believe the seven seals is opened and I believe time shall be no more we have come to a time where everything is ending fast and quickly we know by God's grace that our prophet told us years ago that America is a woman's nation and we can see that coming into play clearer now than ever before but at the same time we're when everything else is falling apart there is a uniting of the bride of Jesus Christ we're not united by a church that we attend the Bible says by one spirit are we baptized into the body of Christ so by God's grace were trusting that everybody has received that baptism because it's important we won't make a rapture without it it doesn't say that you're not saved but you won't make a rapture without the baptism of the Holy Ghost first Timothy 6:15 first Timothy 6:15 everybody loved the Lord this morning I will try my best to keep these thoughts the Lord has been so gracious to me in these last last few days we have had tremendous mind battles but one thing I know for sure through it all God has given us the victory first Timothy 6:15 which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and the Lord of lords if we would then go down to Romans the 11th chapter Romans the 11th chapter we all are going through tremendous battles but we don't have to worry if you are in the cleft of the rock the storm will pass over Romy's 1132 well God have concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all I love that oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who have known the mind of the Lord or who had been his counselor or who have first given to him and it shall be recompense unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen can we go to another scripture let's go to another scripture if you don't mind standing first corinthians the second chapter we'll begin reading at the sixth verse 1st corinthians 2 6 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect I like that yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of God but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God I've jumped down to the 14th verse I'm sorry down to the 14th verse of the same chapter but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritually judgeth all things yet he himself its judged of no man 16th verse in closing for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us Lord than we have been to ourselves I thank you for your presence Lord I'm so unworthy Lord but I thank you because you have made us worthy you have caused us to be accepted in your dear son Jesus Christ and we're grateful for that words cannot express our gratitude this morning and we just pray right now Lord that you bless the service I pray for our sister Janina who's standing in the need of prayer Lord that you would touch her lord coz you are the healer you're the one who can change things transform make something different into something else lord help us now as we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'll try my best to counter go at this pace so that those who are interpreting may be able to relate the message to those who need to listen or to hear I thought about God and I've been thinking about God and just thinking about how powerful he is often time we we forget just how powerful God is sometimes we worry in places where we shouldn't worry we often forget what's only inside of us because we're so used to feeling things seeing things tasting things we seem to just want to classify God or or how can I say a character arrives God's presence by our natural feelings but your natural feelings can arm sometimes be wrong so it's not wise to declare God's presence by hid your feelings because God declared that I will be with you I will always be with you I will never leave you and we must believe that and that faith doesn't feel you don't feel that you must come to know that I was telling brother Troy this morning Jesus never complained about being lonely when the seventy left him he never complained matter of fact he even asked his disciples will you go to when Judas left him he never complained the only time that he ever complained I would say complain but he asked God is his father why has thou forsaken me and brother Troy brought out that one scripture when Jesus says that God is always with me I was talking with a brother the other day and he made a statement that just echo through my soul is that when you are in the Shekinah glory you are never lonely and that was the difference Christ Jesus was always in the Sakana and the Shekinah was always in him and so therefore he did not know what it would feel like for the for the Almighty God to not be there but sometimes in our daily walk we question whether he's there or not but I want to say by God's grace that everything in the universe is connected yet there's only one God and the Bible declares that he's the only potentate in other words he's the only ruler he doesn't have to have counseling with anyone he doesn't have a board that regulates anything he's a regulator he Almighty God he is the one that we claim that's in us and I think about the majesty of the majestic part of God how that God connects everything and nothing moves until it will he wills it to move I think within my mind how that the world in itself can rotate around the Sun spin in the air and never miss a beat always the same time never gets behind in time why because our God is eternal and we understand that everything is moving by the power of God everybody's life is connected you may not think so but it's true we know that when someone passes on we always feel that some is now missing we can't explain it especially if it is a loved one someone we've been connected to someone that we knew and you know what is so funny because I used to wear funny but I mean it's strange that even those people who you may not even you may not have known but if they should pass away you miss their presence we're connected the world call it a circle of life it life is a circle it is eternal but not the way they defines it because you got to realize Amen that God does things in a way that sometimes I would say like this most of the time God's Way demands for us to have faith faith in God because his ways of past finding out even the prophet of God tells us that sometimes when we see what we call at night a shooting star he said it's not a star falling it's just light because if a star would move out of his orbit it would probably influence everything in the circle in the whole universe things will move will it will affect now you think about it what I'm saying because you got to realize that when Adam fail it affected the entire universe so much so that everything must be renewed everything must be done over a new creation had to be formed because of son of God got out of position so we must be in our place we must be as sons and daughter of God if we never fallen back there the thing would have been turning there have been no death and not nothing else but things be to God there is coming a paradox when God Himself was set her back in place where she should be is that right remember the ant alluvion world when they exploded the water and the water came in front of the earth the earth spun out from God out from the Sun and that's what we call the Ice Age but it was an instant freezing an instant cold is that right and every time we move out of the presence of God there is a chill there is a coldness that come upon us but when we in that presence God does something for you hallelujah most people don't even believe in a paradox why because it's unexplainable here we are we breathe in God's air every day and we can't even explain we don't have a motor and if we had a motor what's powering it up it's all invisible is that right it's all invisible and you and I must understand there are so many things that we cannot even explain but the Bible tells us trust the Lord with all of your heart and lean not to your own understanding I want to say it like this when sickness falls upon us we would have never known it was a bad spirit that causes the sickness hallelujah it was the Bible debt that are described what sickness is afflictions that it was demon power that caught all these things that happen to us is that right and all of those things came by the fall but think about it just at the speaking of a word by the authority of the word can make that devil leave now you can't explain it you and I don't see it when it happens we see the effects of it but when the devil leave we don't normally see the devil but the effects of his leaving brings our healing bring something about that we can see with our own eyes hallelujah the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God you know that's what I don't understand why people will allow demons to enter into their spirit and they have a hard time letting the Holy Ghost in I just got one amen you understand what I'm saying somehow the devil in our minds have deceived us because it is amazing how we will allow a spirit that's not of God to occupy when we've got the power to cast it out where two or three are gathered in my name the Bible said they can ask what they will Condon ask you to try to figure it out and all of us have to deal with spirits you understand me and I say this by the grace of God I'm trying to build your faith because brother Bruce can't do a thing but the Lord Jesus Christ can do all things and all things are possible to them that believe now sister came here for help if she can't get help from us where can she go you understand me I'm talking to a church this morning because I want you to realize by God's grace it's unexplainable but it's possible though what we need to understand that if the Shekinah glory is in you that's life everybody looks for that Fountain of Youth but that Fountain of Youth is God himself then he said he did not say he said to the woman at the well if you believe on me as the scripture has said out of your belly shall flow rivers of water you'll never thirst again that's the God we serve our God is not an organization our God is not a denomination our God is the word hallelujah you love the Lord we must realize that he is the only authority we cannot allow ourselves to believe that Satan has authority when we know he's been stripped Jesus Christ defeated the devil at Calvary hallelujah and it has been proven to us through this day by Malecha for cuz no man could have done what he did that was Jesus Christ openly showing us that what happened at Carey was a finished work hallelujah and what God is doing in you is a finished work there is nothing you can do to save yourself salvation is of the Lord hey somebody help me here do what God did for you and that's the thing we keep looking at ourselves and yes the Bible said examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith but when you find yourself not in the faith all you've got to ask God for is forgiveness and restoration hallelujah because not one man have ever stayed with the word like they should hallelujah when the book of redemption was open when those seven seals were opened by God's grace amen it revealed God's purpose his plan and his victory for all of us Tom by going to a new city you must become that new city before you go to the new city hallelujah you are really miss Teresa lung hallelujah a city of what peace hallelujah and if you represents peace you must reflect peace that right hallelujah Jerusalem was conquered by David and his band they gave Jerusalem a new name and the only way that you can ever receive that name is that you must be conquered by David not a David D David the God that was behind David Jesus Christ Himself the son of David hallelujah who have known the mind of the Lord and you and I must understand we don't understand why we go through all these things but understand we go through these things for a divine purpose the Bible said we were created for his pleasure and his will hallelujah my brother ever said that if you please God for him for God to send him to hell he won't God to do what's going to please him now you got to have a great low level of love and understanding hallelujah to say that cause when you say that you realize there is no way that you can go but if that's what he would choose for me so be it hallelujah ah you won't be able to change it anyway ha little come on somebody you must understand that even in this day what you do doesn't change the fact of who you are and where you're headed Oh somebody help me here you see I ain't trying to be saved because I was saved before the foundation of the world so were you and if I was saved and you were say before the foundation of the world what is the problem the problem is that we got mental situation here God is either God or he's not God Jesus Christ is either God or he's not God is that right God told a brother Barry said listen Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new how many I believe that oh I believe that then whatever Jesus Christ did in the Old Testament he can do it again because Hebrews 13 and eight said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever did you know that even in the Old Testament people were being healed hallelujah is that right look at the leopard naman right dip seven times a leopard nobody put no oil on him that water didn't change him but obedience to the word Oh somebody help me here it was the obedience to the word that literally healed him and obedience to the word right now today works in the same way if you have faith you can say to a mountain be thou move hallelujah I don't care if you say Lord Jesus Christ I believe that I'm healed this moment and you never ever say or give a negative report after that God is obligated to heal you now I just got that off the tape God is obligated once you say Lord I believe this I ask of this I receive of this and you never give a negative report after that because that negative report will erase everything but when you hold fast that do the words that have been spoken there's an angel that must bring it to pass that's God's will that's God's Way and who's gonna change it they ask that man and I'm just going the way that God wants me to go they asked that man who did sin the man who was born blind thirty years never seen eyesight before now Mateus I'm let me let me let me say this to you if you've never seen before how can you have faith for something you've never seen you don't even know what light is you've never seen light you've never felt light you don't know what it is but God said you can have it somebody help me here you've never seen heaven you've never been you understand me in the natural but something tells you it exists and you have prayed to know that is yours it becomes yours Abraham looked for a city whose builder and maker was God never been there before but he knew he was going he knew it existed brother man said where where where where Abraham stopped he said the city was right above him hallelujah see what we don't understand is that this is what we call a faith gospel hallelujah we a faith civilization everything we do must come by faith my faith must be applied and faith is something that God gives you it's not hope it's beyond hope it's when hope has no hope Faye says it's possible faith still says it's mine it's not what the doctor say I wish I had been there I would say hey if there was a doctor let him go examine Lazarus hallelujah oh my you understand me a situation that seems out of control a situation that seemed like it was unrepairable but then jesus said it to Mary and Martha if you believe you'll see the resurrection somebody help me here you see ah you must understand once God set you free and Jesus Christ has set you free the devil has no right to reimprisonment Eve the slave driver who was the devil you do not have to go back ha because your Jubilee has sounded you're free and he whom the son have set free is free indeed think about it God allowed us all to be unbelievers at one time I love that not some of us all of us all of us were unbelievers and God did that so that he could show his mercy toward us oh I believe well if you believe is because of the mercies of God it's the grace of God that causes you to believe hallelujah I'm so glad that I'm saved who can know the mind of God did you not know all of us this morning was predestinated to be here before time God saw you here the very color dress and color pants the color everything God saw you here you was ordained to come here you was ordained to hear this hallelujah because God cares whoo Jesus help us Lord talk about a paradox I don't know why I believe other than he gave me the faith you understand me something holds me I don't hold it it holds me and it's unexplainable it wasn't that I was a good person I was just as wicked as everybody else maybe a little more exceedingly but God's mercy and grace family why God ordained you to see this message and others can't see it why can your eyes see this when others can't see it that's the mercy and grace of God I feel like shouting the thing that I love about this message because we realize by God's grace that we've got more of God coming you say well brother books the bride is already in our revival yeah but when the revival is over what comes next because revival means getting all the trash out God coming alone getting all the trash out of it I wanted to get everything don't leave a speck of darkness in me get everything out of me and when everything is gone he brings down that anointing whew then it's going home time but don't reject the anointing you know God's anointing is not always you know you got to feel the wind blow you ain't got to feel cheers all the time when God comes to anoint you it's just anoint you to do right huh when Jesus stood up there in that pulpit and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled he was so anointed because the presence of the Lord was not only over him but in him and when you get that anointing like that you don't run and jump there's something serious about it how old somebody help me hallelujah you and I must understand that God says and I read this last week I was out of Isaiah 30 and 26 moreover the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be Sevenfold you understand me how many fools do you have when the Bible says 7 oh that means that revelation of this message is supposed to cause a Sevenfold effect on the believer so what they did yesterday cannot be compared to what God wants to do today but we sitting back as if there's nothing for us to do when the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations of God but God is looking for somebody with a made of mine Sevenfold light of seven days in the day that the Lord binded up the breach of his people is that right we're still living in that day where the bridge have been bind is that right with that lamb took the book somebody help me here when the lamb took the book when that when that it came to a place it was a matter of life and death because no man was fine worthy that bloody lamb he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that said on the phone it was at that time the breach came back together man and God became one again that's why Jesus could pray father I would that may be one even as we are one did you know the Bible says if all the miracles that Jesus wrought on earth would not be contained in a book he did too many things you understand me and likewise if he's the same today as he was yesterday God is still doing things hallelujah is that all right now I'm bringing this to you because I just believed not only just in a supernatural God but I believe in a supernatural people who's being formed into the very image and likeness of God hallelujah God interested in your failures as I was with Moses he says Moses I'm not concerned that your failures I'm looking at your commission and you and I must understand God ain't looking at your failures he's looking at your commission at the Commission and the bride supposed to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh there is a work to do but we must wake up come out of this dust that we've been laying in shake yourself realize that who you are hallelujah you either born of God or you're not born of God you either up God or you're not of God you must say who you are you must recognize that that's who I am you know what do you mean one thing I say I love Samson you hear me call him and say things about him all the time because to remind me him I'm Neal he reminds me of me yeah and you come to that place in your life and you say Oh Lord once more well how would he say Oh Lord once more if he didn't know who he was he was among the Philistines was Samson knew he was a Nazarite he understood he was chosen of God but look at Samson he looked like a wreck he was a mess everything God told him to do he failed at it hallelujah all he had was history I remember we in God don't know God wants you to be Jesus today hallelujah is that right God want us to be Jesus today Jesus yesterday K help you Jesus today is that right we can look in the past at all that's what he used to do oh that's what he's gonna do in the future but he won't let Jesus today that's what this message is about when the prophet of God was here he was the Jesus of that day somebody help me here not just him there were other believers who reflected Jesus Christ in a man in their right mind know that we don't have the power to do nothing but all power in heaven and earth is given to Jesus Christ hallelujah are you the body you know I think sometimes we like I said we let these feelings get in our way uh-huh oh god don't worry about that he worked with faith faith and feelings are two different things two worlds apart you understand me feelings is a scientific hallelujah that's what the scientific church worked with hallelujah but the church that is born of God she only moved by faith in God am I making sense you and I must understand that this word come to transform us and I don't know about you but I look for changes every day I get discouraged when I don't see changes in me positive changes moving closer to God hearing God's voice more often you understand me being able to talk with him and he talks back to me now I don't know whether y'all experience those things but he's real God talks back did you know that hallelujah it ain't just your mind sometimes your mind can't even come up with that good stuff like that God talks is this okay give me a few more minutes you and I must understand that the bride she's recognizing who she is little by little she's coming into play she's coming into her position now to be honest with you we should have been there long time ago but we got too many distractions we got too many worldly interests hallelujah but don't you understand God calls for a total separation from underneath oh I've got some good quotes but I better move on my point is sometimes you have to move on and say bye-bye to even friends in order to do the perfect will of God there's a transition Rebecca had to say mama I'll see you later daddy I'll see you later brother sister I'll see you later I'm going to meet the king she had to separate why they wanted her to stay you can't stay in one place when God calls you got to move hallelujah you've got to move you got to go forward because I'm going to tell you something you you you you until you circumcised away everything that's not like God he cannot John the Baptist had to do it Jesus had to do it brother Branham had to do it and you got to do it we all must separate ourselves you love the Lord it's a transition because you must realize that that book of Revelation 21 9 the Word of God says I will show you the the bride the Lambs wife so she transitioned she's not she changes from bride into wife you can't just Phaedra I'm the bride no there's got to be a transition there's gotta be a marital affair there's gotta be an invisible union between you and God you in Christ oh yes the great ceremony will be celebrated in heaven but there is an invisible union right now between Christ and the believer and God will not be unequally yoked love the Lord just give me a few more minutes you and I must realized that the pressure is on God is expecting things out of you hallelujah God is expecting things out of you and guess what you can't even do what he's expecting you to do and the thing about it is he didn't ask you to do it he promised he would do it he that begun the good work in you he is faithful to completing but if you don't trust a word what's gonna happen to you you're not gonna be happy you're gonna be sad because oh you're trying to work it out Jesus on already worked it out the Bible says that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former you know that was the longest that was the reason why didn't get saved at the beginning when my mom would say come on go to church come on big you know Christ and got another but you know what I cuz in my mind I thought I had to do it I thought I had to stop this stop that stop this stop that and I didn't it quit me when I made up my mind to serve the Lord Jesus it quit me y'all hear me I don't get a lot of emails on that one but it's the truth the prophet of God said you don't have to quit nothin if you eat and you read and you pray it will quit you if you resist the devil he will flee from you the devil don't want to be around you if you came manifesting y'all know that's the truth if you said hey I try to tell people you don't need the Holy Ghost to quit smoking you don't need the Holy Ghost to kick quit drinking hallelujah you just gotta have a leader my cuz if your mind is made up guess what the devil said I ain't playin with him no more her no more she ain't gonna do what I wanted to do what is an alcoholic demon or a cigarette Dean come on you wouldn't even know people are smoking but you know what the devil do he'll put them out there in the cold cold weather on the side of the building and they go like they so enjoying it what is that demon that was to be seen hallelujah oh the man walking down the street whatever he's doing it's a demon in him that makes he you know right and if a demon wants to be seen what about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wants to be Sene he wants to be on display you can call it the token of your life but he wants to be on display he wants the world to see you as the redeemed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he wants to be singing Hallelujah is that Alright come on somebody I will keep saying that I believe that a person if you really want to quit you gotta want to quit and when you want to quit in God see that your mind is made up he will then come in and do it but you can't fake it when it comes to God hallelujah the moment you say this is gonna be my last drink you ain't delivered this is going to be my last cigarette huh you just deceiving yourself you have compromised when you say Lord I'm not gonna do it that's it you don't go back oh come on didn't I tell you the universe and everything is united is that the truth did you not know that even the Prophet says when he was ready to cast out Devils according to whatever the devil is they will star you 19 because their strength by force force you know me in multitudes in a number you get a greater strength so the demons unite to keep away keep from being cast out come that's the truth now if demons got enough sister unite and become one accord on one Accord what about believe us Lord hallelujah if the Holy Ghost and we get on one mind one Accord not one devil would be able to stand in this service he's at just two or three one God one mine we could cast out whatever devil come in here cuz that's the Bible that's whatsoever you will in my name you believe in it you shall receive it hallelujah I don't need people you know say what brothers dad times I lay hands on me and I pray for me is that right the Bible said lay hands on the sick they shall recover you part of that lay hands on yourself if you believe that God would give you the victory all right just the way it is you love God this is your inheritance hmm this is your inheritance you mean to tell me the only potentate is in me the potentate the only authority God Himself in me in you and then he says that's what you will he can't go back on his word and you understand if God said no that know it to me is just as good as yes he knows what's best Lord not don't even don't even put that on the end of your prayer if you don't mean it not my will but thine be done y'all know your we say that and we said an original istic way when we really want our will to be done but God knows what's best I hope you been blessed with this this morning see do you realize your children of the promise see we're not from the wild side we are the children of the promise I love that God keeps every one of his promises hallelujah let me tell you let me say it like this don't you understand being a child of the promise that means that every promise God promised to give you he's gonna give it to you you gotta wait some time but is yours hallelujah understand you didn't bring yourself to God God called you and some of us who've been raised in the message you just raised in the message until God called you that's what made the difference cause you was in there but you didn't can feel the call like everybody else oh I'm raised in the message what that means until God put a desire in your heart you were just raised in the message but God has to put something in yo huh and then we put that in your heart you call it's an assurance you elected and now God is gonna do great things for you I know you said what brother what are you saying I'm so thankful that the seed that I have in me is incorruptible hallelujah it cannot be corrupted what are you saying brother Brooks oh yes listen because we do bad things we have bad little habits doesn't mean we're not saved oh that's the truth remember the preacher who died and I call it brother Baron said he was their God spanked him and put him to sleep right so God don't lose one but you see when I get there hallelujah whatever will walk that is and that look chest I want something I want some rewards I want to be able to go in there and find all kinds of stuff that God then gave me I don't want to just go through a big old chest and all I could find is one thing big ole chance and you ain't got number one reward in there huh y'all did y'all know that everybody's gonna receive different rewards everybody's going to receive different rewards some gonna receive more than others because some worked harder than others some did more than others somebody help me here hallelujah one brother said at least give me a crown so I could throw it at his feet hallelujah give me something to the heart that I can say God because of your grace and your mercy is that right your grace and mercy brought me through is that right that's all we'd be able to see how God I've got a lot of stuff here but by God's grace trying to find something here I want to be totally transformed and I'm closing on these thoughts now if God saw a world that was void without shade you and I don't have no idea what that was like before God moved upon the water and before he spoke and said let there be light we have no idea I edges probably was a catastrophic mess everything was rearranged y'all believe that if you don't look around the world is void is out of cadence it darkness cover the whole place you understand me upon the waters the people look at him look at him look at him they look like creatures of the dark of the night is that right oh come on did you go down into the ocean where there is no light and bring up a fish and it looked like something from another planet why because there is no light to transform it you know what perhaps before the fall it looked differently because remember cactus is only came by the fall the way we see cactus was not the way it was it was after the curse thorns and thistles came into existence bro Isaiah said that they're coming a day that even the deserts have blue God at the rising of the Sun is going to cause all those things that have been perverted by the darkness to change oh I'm coming to something God want to transform us from a tadpole right you know tadpoles are transformations they start off like a little fish then the tail drops off then they grow legs yeah the tap one might be a bad example for some of us cuz I ain't calling nobody a frog but let's go to them to the world right to the butterfly what a transformation hallelujah but when that butterfly is transformed from that worm they look nothing alike and God wants that kind of transformation in us that the Holy Ghost can change you so much till you look nothing like you used to even the world can see you've been transformed Alleluia hey that right I'm gonna read this quote in I'm a clothes for this so and pick it up this evening because we'll be chewing on this for a little while because I won't understand that the that Aaron's rod bloomed I used to wonder for years how did that Manor stay fresh in the Holies of Holies I did not understand it for a long time until I heard brother Brown say because of the Shekinah glory was always there you understand me it took a day rod don't tell me you in the challenge that kind of glory and there are no changes when you in the Shekinah glory there must be changes and these changes comes by the Shekinah glory and not just the stick you understand me it wasn't the rod that changed itself it was where that rod was playing behind the veil behind the curtain when you are behind the curtain of God amen your life will change and the prophet of God said that's the greatest of all mysteries God warning us back behind that veil into the shikhandi said we should live in as a kind of everyday everyday he loved the Lord you're brought with a price and you're not your own right that's why the Bible said therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods now you and I must understand that God owns us I'm so glad he bought me I'm so glad he bought me I don't have when you buy something you got it in your house you don't have to worry about that thing you'll sit there that little job whatever fly it you know you don't take it doesn't take care of itself the owner take care of it when I want to come and see that that look that Jah got a little dust on a tea dust is it hallelujah we're not only season that John needs some washing or whatever it the owner washes it that's how I am when dust gets on me he dust me off when I get dirty he washes me you understand me it's all God's doing and I'm so glad about it God has called you but what God is what is God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or son whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the Word of God regardless of what the price is our redeemed emption wasn't a cheap thing it the son of God had to die for us things of value comes of great price we can't handle rose a message like his cheap it took a lot the price was great the value of it amen we can't even put a value on it because it's priceless and you and I must realize because of this message we cannot allow this message to look like some denominational thing it's priceless this is the word and the Word of God will not come back void won't do it can't happen God's will will be done in your life my life our life whatever that may be you love the Lord let us bow in a word of Prayer father God we come before you we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you've been better to us and we been to ourselves the Lord I've seen you do great things you've done great things for me when Satan gave me strokes you changed that when he declared I had cancer you changed that Lord when he tried to take my sight you changed that hallelujah and I'm so thankful because I know hallelujah you are alive and well yes Lord and there is no failure Lord I pray right now for my sister Janina we're gonna pray for her lord hallelujah I feel your presence lord I know because of your word it's done but we go to pray Lord because you said if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover and Lord right now we believe with all of our heart we thank you for your word there is no good thing in us but we trust your word Lord we know that your work and not come back void so we give honor to your Lord we give respect to you Lord we know we can't make you do anything but we want to say whatever your perfect will is for our sister's life so let it be done but we're coming in your name we acknowledging you because you said whatsoever we do word or deed do it all in your name Lord and you told us O God that if we acknowledge you in all our ways you will direct our paths we pray for those who heard the word today lord I pray something was said or done that will give them more faith and more love for you bless the service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen as our sister come we're gonna pray for her me [Music] if I brother Troy would come my brother Keith will come come and help me pray please god bless you sister so so Janine I'd like to say by God's grace the only way the devil won't leave if that there's some sin or something in your life that you haven't confessed you know I'm not asking you to confess it to me but right now we're just going to give you a little moment to search your soul and if there be anything that you need to make right before God ask for his forgiveness we ask that you do that now
