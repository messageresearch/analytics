TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh let us stand as we stand and let us turn to Isaiah 4 you love the Lord Isaiah 4 and then we're going to go to Ephesians 1 Isaiah 4 and Ephesians 1 for those of you may not know our brother Luna had a beautiful baby boy sent us a beautiful picture he look like brother uh John already amen so we thank God for the delivery and that everything went safe with them amen we appreciate it amen glad to see everybody here this morning so anyway Isaiah uh four you love God people of Lord we are in a uh place where I believe that if we could see what God is doing um I believe we will be okay uh you we've been dealing with um uh the age of the of The Perfect Bride and and we're still continuing this we may give it certain uh uh different topics to kind of emphasize something uh more so but I I want to say uh to you this morning um this is the greatest time in my life uh uh because I realize who I amallah and uh and hopefully uh by the end of the day you'll know who you are if there be any question uh my message on tonight is or this morning is to the elect lady amen so coming from Isaiah 4 uh start we start reading uh the uh from the first verse and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our bread and wear our own apparel only let us be call by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assembly a cloud and smoke by Day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense you can hold your finger there because I'm coming back let's go to Ephesians please Ephesians 1:10 Ephesians 1:10 reads and in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen let's read the 11th verse in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and I can go on with that scripture it's wonderful scripture amen but you know we've got to get to the lesson amen so let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you right now Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord oh God you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves and we just pray father God that you break the bread of life to us this morning as you always have and Lord we'll be uh grateful we'll give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen one of the things I'd like to bring to our minds is that we are in our different Age We liken ourselves to be in the seventh Church age but according to the messenger the Bride of Jesus Christ is no longer in the seventh Church age and if you don't believe that you go listen to the Future home brother brandham says amen the Le Andy and age is over and so therefore we are now in what we call an eternal age he liken it as the uh Eighth Day or the holy convocation now we're at a time amen that we're back to where we come from Hallelujah and this is what the seven Thunders was all about the mysteries of God being revealed the prophet of God tells us amen that in this message that he uh God ordained him to give to us was not only to reveal to us amen uh the the the present tense but also the future amen he he also was ordained to tie up all the Loose Ends that uh uh Wesley and uh Luther and all of them uh the reformers left off amen so we also had uh the understanding how God comes along and he opens up the seven seal to us we realize Amen brother bham said it like this he said the Sixth Seal is Moses and Elijah so when we understand amen the six seal amen being persons or individual we understand as brother bandam said those messengers of each age was a seal all right and the voice amen of those Messengers were Thunders it was the voice of God speaking to us that we might understand the message of our day so when that those Thunders would utter their voices those who had an ear to hear would literally hear amen the message of their age it was like when Jesus Christ went to Peter James and all the other and said come follow me Hallelujah it was the same voice amen that caught you and I in every age not some other voice it was the voice of God Amen that is now echoing to us right now amen is that all right that's why Amen in 1 John 3:2 the Bible said beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when we He Shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as what he is and see that is the mystery of our age not another Jesus but the same Jesus you see what I'm saying because denominations are and organizations are worshiping another Jesus the Same Jesus another Jesus that Paul speak spoke of he said if I preach to you another Jesus amen but Paul did not preach to us another Jesus he had preached to us the original Hallelujah the same Jesus declaring to us that he's the same yes today today and forever he's a God that changes not amen so we see by the grace of God Amen that the Bible said when he shall appear so shall we he be we be like him is that all right when did he appear in 1963 but when in his appearing now let me put it this way when the prophet was on the scene whether people recognize it or not that was the appearing of Jesus Christ y'all hear what what I'm saying it was the appearing it wasn't a man it was actually the appearing of Jesus Christ because Amen in the spiritual realm he was doing everything that Jesus would do so he wasn't a he wasn't um uh uh uh showing himself like like the original John John the Baptist said I must decrease and he must increase so we find out amen that's why the prophet of God had to go off the scene y'all know that that he might decrease and that God might increase where in your hearts so we find out amen by the grace of God Amen that here the appearing he's he's coming he's doing the same signs and what is he doing he he he he brings us to a place that he's he's he's the signs and the Wonders they were all to catch the attention of the people hallelujah right that he would co uh uh attract amen the Bride of Jesus Christ come on somebody see they didn't understand it but Jesus said that his coming would be like a thief in the night amen and what was he doing he was breaking into the kingdom of Satan see because a lot of us didn't know that organizational ISM and denominationalism had become the kingdom of Satan amen so he was breaking into the kingdom of Satan and stealing out his jewels by what the word of God he was like a thief in the night amen coming in taking in and catching the elected and saying come out of her my people that you'll be not partakers of her sins am amen but as as as always when he appears we find the intellectual calling it a devil come on he said if they did it in the green what what to do with in the dry so we find out when he comes he's literally bringing a a a message and the same thing that happen to Jesus happened to Jesus again amen because it wasn't the that they were call him the the the Flesh of the man or devil Hallelujah they were saying just like they said in that day he doeth these things by beaz above and and the word of God said now this is Forgiven in my day Jesus said he said but when it comes Amen to the day of the son of man when it comes when I am revealing myself over again and you say these things he said it is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost and it will not be forgiven you so he comes along and now the the the the the part that's uh uh coming we find amen that he's now fulfilling Revelations 3 in the leian age after breaking uh uh and identifying uh who the the organizations are and who they really what's happening bringing in the market of Beast telling these people amen you're not living holy anymore what appears to be holy is not holy it's it's legalism and words and man-made doctrines and Creeds and these things be not of God he said I don't care what it looks like I'm telling you what it is in the way that God is looking at you right and so when he began to bring all of these things together amen we find out amen they turned him out women were still wearing long dresses for the most part most of them were still wearing long hair and when he comes along and says now it is not the perfect will of God for a woman to preach and a lot of them had women preachers and women pastors I'm talking about the Pentecostals right because God sent him to the Pentecostals is that right that's what he said none of the other organizations would have him so he had to come to the church amen that would literally come to a place of manifesting what leay out sea means people's rights right he said that was really why most of the ministers missed him because the church had her rights now let me move on by the great of God I'm saying all of this so you can recognize that you are special that you did not come to see this because of your intellect but I want to say it like this God had you written in his heart before it was ever written Amen on the pages of this book now come on somebody as I was telling the children in Sunday school this morning this is not the beginning your life did not begin here it literally it began in in C if there's such thing as a beginning because eternal life has no beginning and so what is happening here is because God allowed us to know evil so we could be just like him come on the Bible said when Adam and Eve Sinn he said now the the word went out man has become like you God he knows good and evil see you claim be like God and just know no good if God didn't know good and evil he would have never caught Lucifer in his heart but because he knew good and evil he said Lucifer you're evil you have said in your heart I will have sin come on somebody nobody else in heaven would have seen it oh Lord have mercy but here God and that's why discernment this every holy ghost fill individual has discernment God gives you a portion amen where you can discern good from Evil to the elect lady chosen by God woo hallelujah amen God is bringing this message to you this morning amen so that you can see that we're not just coming to something that God has previously made but this thing was before the foundation of the world the Bible said we were even in him going back to Isaiah 4 the word of God tells us that in that day brother brandham in the future home said this scripture refers to our day he said where seven women amen will come to one man basically say take away my reproach he said prostitutes illame women you name it he said they come and they want the the the the the reproach taken away he said but yet in that day also he said there will be and he said wherever you see Zion he said that represents the bride Zion is another name for the bride and he said wherever you see Zion he said that is the Bride of Jesus Christ he said because in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and C for for them that are escaped of Israel amen so we understand who the bran the branch is Jesus Christ folks I am the branch I am the branch right amen so we realize by the grace of God God comes along and he's basically working with us and showing us amen that in this day not only will the Bride of Jesus Christ be saved are redeemed hello but Israel will be redeemed as well right and brother B say this is this scripture refers to our day amen now I I want you to understand amen that you and I and no matter how I how can I say it God is the magnet he's the one that's pulling on your heart right now right amen so when you realize amen that God is the one pulling on your heart you must recognize that he will cause you also to Triumph amen I haven't even got to my scripture yet but he will cause you to Triumph is that right amen and he goes on brother brandham I'm I'm kind of working with these scriptures back and forth Ephesians talk about the fullness of time when God will manifest himself self in the fullness of time but he said when it's full what do you do you go back to the eighth day and he said there's no Eighth Day in reality it's the first day right so you go back Amen to the first day before the fall this is why brother Brandon brings us to this place he said the seals when the opening of the seals amen when it came forth it brought the bride amen not just the calvary amen it brought her back before the fall amen we are now living in a time where you as a bride of Jesus Christ have the potential to live in such a Godly way amen you'll be living in Eden amen oh Hallelujah before the fall amen living in Eden before the fall that's your potential am amen that you can literally because remember we wouldn't have known had not this message come we would have not known what Adam was capable of doing am but brother Bram tells us that Adam had the capability amen of changing the weather yes commanding the animals come on somebody if anything would move contrary Amen to what Adam desired he the spoken word put it back in place and that's our potential we are in a place right now if we can have the faith that God that's why he said in that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father's in me and I am that's so important amen goes on to say when in the future home he says that's always God's judgment now listen when he makes his final judgment first of all he calls you he justifies you and bring you to redeem Redemption then his judgment break forth upon you see God looks at you he brings you to a place of redemption then he brings you he said then his judgment break forth upon you and the Holy Ghost in fire cleanses away the sin amen he said then you're his right then he can come live in you and Rule Your Kingdom right because really it's not you ruling your kingdom it's a God in you ruling your kingdom because remember when God separated from Adam Adam had no rulership it was always God and him ruling let me say it again when God separated from Adam Adam became like everybody and everything else he had no rulership he was no longer amen as we would say the god of the earth he was Fallen right amen the God but once God comes back into man he's now standing in the same place Adam stood before the fall hello amen if that wouldn't be the case then why would he say in the Book of John greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world wo come on somebody right I showed you by the grace of God last week how that brother brandham talks about it and how in the in this message Israel and the church brother brandham said when God when it uh uh Jesus Christ died God took his soul and sent it back to us as the Holy Ghost so you and I must understand that's why the nature if you got the Holy Ghost will not be your nature it will be the divine nature that Peter preached oh my God in you because that nature was the thing that was hidden amen from the world throughout all times and why would it not be that God would take a hot tempered Jew and show him that you couldn't be what I wanted you to be until this divine nature amen ah Hallelujah is on the inside of you and on display oh come on somebody now amen so you and I must realize amen that we're not called to be church members actually amen that age is over amen we're now in what we call the bride age and this bright age amen brings us into an eternal age oh my that's why the Bible said he that believeth on me as the scriptures are said out of his belly shall rivers of water amen and he said you know what you will and you cannot die amen Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle be desire he said I've got one waiting for me why he said no matter what comes my way I cannot die did you know brother random said it like this she said you were always saved amen if you are truly the elect of God you've already you've always been saved amen he said this is just the gospel is to bring back to memory of who you are oh glory Lord but you were saved before the foundation of the world Amen if you were in him you never was lost I don't mean no har we were lost to ourselves but Jesus Christ always knew where you were God don't have to find nothing he knows where you are Oh Glory to God is that all right turn with me now to second John please second John now we we talk about um I'm telling you like this it's true the bride those who are of the Bride are pressing into two and let me put it this when I say pressing into let's take that word and say yielding into yielding into y'all understand what I mean because I'm going tell you something it's not easy to yield from your will versus in into God's will you say yes it is I can just do it like the drop up no you can't can't because even my Lord had to pray he says come follow me and pray with me an hour right come pray with me an hour maybe some things are easy but when it comes to real serious situations amen where you've got to deny yourself and die in it you need some prayer is that right 2 John 1-5 any everybody know what I'm talking about there's a fight going on every day to do the perfect will of God at all times in my mind in my spirit and mostly in my soul right you know the word of God and that's what that's what what what gets you because that life in you is saying do what I want you to do do what I want you to do right so he puts you in a position to see whether you can obey him because remember Adam had the choice to do what God wanted him to do or to do what his will said right and he did what he wanted to do right which was contrary in that sense to what God will was for him second John amen 1 we'll read it the Elder unto the well beloved gaas whom I love in the truth beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper e t h continue to prosper so that means you're on a journey that means amen that you you you you're dying like Paul says daily Amen to yourself and you're living unto Christ and the more you live unto Christ the more your soul Prosper amen is that all right am for I Rejoice I'm I'm reading the third third division of of John I'm sorry for I rejoiced greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walth in the truth right I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth M and and that's that's every Minister's that's every uh pastor's prayer Amen to see the people of God walking in the truth is that all right turn back with me now to second John which I originally wanted you to read wanted to read he said the Elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but I also all they have known the truth for the truth sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever what is the truth Jesus Christ says I am the truth so this truth that you're walking in is the fact that you know that Jesus Christ is on the inside you're no longer a caral man amen you're no longer listen let me put it this way until we come to a place in this message that we believe that we are a new creature you will always look backwards like a frog amen let me say it again until we in this message come to believe that we are a new creature amen created after God in his own image if you don't come to the place that you know that you're a new creature you won't have no fight amen because you'll always be looking back like a frog hello somebody you will always look back because you don't REM like James says don't come to the mirror of the word and forget what kind of a man you are amen and that's what we do the word of God comes we say Amen we rejoice in it we walk out the door forgetting that we are truly Sons and Daughters of God right now amen being formed shaped and molded into the very image of Our Lord I'm glad about it for the true sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever amen Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the father in truth and love let's read all the way to the fth verse I rejoice as greatly that I found of children walking in the truth as we have received a commandment from the father and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto you the unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and this is the love that we walk after his commandment this is the Commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning you shall walk in it amen now no other age let me put it that way could literally do this am but now amen we're not amen like in the Pentecostal age amen just dealing amen with the with the blessings of the Lord Brother Band said when that presence come in the church like that he said that's the blessings that's his that's just basically his presence but we don't we don't just want the presence am we want him amen God in us knocking knocking knocking trying to get in Hallelujah into your heart the presence is good come on somebody amen when we feel the presence of the Lord that's good amen but that's not all it amen because remember brother Brandon standing there in the pool pit and the presence of the Lord was everywhere the rejoicing of God was everywhere and he's standing there and he says I'm waiting on him so we got to recognize by the grace of God Amen we're we're beyond that that that experience of his presence in that sense won't get us all the way oh come on somebody you got to have the literal life of Jesus Christ on the inside of you and Peter told you how to get it am Every Man Has a cross Jesus said take up your cross and follow me you got a cross and you got to crucify yourself amen amen amen amen amen second Peter 1:10 is this okay to the elect lady you chosen of God everybody everybody I put it this way God has given you a different meal is that all right come on look at look at look what God did there in Joseph he took Joseph and all of his brothers and laid him out at the table and then he G gives a double portion to Benjamin come on somebody amen and that's the way God does Amen to the bride he gives a double portion oh my of his Spirit of himself of everything right amen second Peter amen when we look at uh uh uh we can read it wherefor the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall amen do what things the things he previously wrote about amen all right and brother bandam said it like this you can't add on to it until the birth comes when the birth comes oh Hallelujah that's good but we're growing up into who Christ amen and as I said if you read the songs of Solomon he did not want an immature woman he wanted a mature life so in that that Songs of Solomon God is telling us I won't settle for less than a mature bride oh come on somebody who will be in my image and my likeness now I showed you by the grace of God why go brother said listen he said God took Adam he took Eve out of Adam he said he didn't take another dust right he used the same dust amen every substance of Adam was in Eve come on somebody Adam was made from the dust of the earth Eve was made from Adam right and he showed I showed you amen that God significantly did a thing that we would have missed but by the grace of God through Revelation he showed us that when God breathed into the first Adam he had he breathed into Eve amen amen because when he formed Eve out of Adam she was already living Hallelujah and if he did that to the first Adam he's got to do it to the second Adam who is Jesus Christ himself you must be made out of the same system that's why the Bible said if that same Spirit be in you that was also in Christ Jesus as it quickened his Mor bottle body it shall Quicken yours the same stuff that's why he said it's got to be the same signs the same wonders the same Miracles the same amen understand this though where the church is falling is because we can't keep our tongues quiet huh you know the backbiting the gossip and whatever more we going that hinders that hinders the move of God and and and and until you as an individual let me put it as an individual you'll never come to Perfection until this is controlled amen till that tongue is controlled you won't reach Perfection not as God would have it you understand what I'm working with amen now coming from the message of the 10 virgins is this okay he says now she makes up in her mind which way she has a pattern showing that God has a pattern brother brandom talks about it amen in the in the five wise and the five foolish versions he said they one is predestinated to be bride the other one is predestinated to be foolish 10 versions and he said it was determined by God Amen which way he would cut the pattern amen it's not even determined by you amen it's determined by God which way he he cuts the pattern thank God you on the bride side amen hallelujah thank you Lord you know I can preach this but I want to go this way I'm excited enough to do it but let me go the way I'm going see she makes up her her mind talking about a lady with a pattern which way she has a pattern here and she makes up in her mind which way she's going to cut this pattern and what it's going to be cut from is that right well she gets what she thinks is the sufficient and best part of the pattern is that right and causes it uh all the same Goods but she lays it like this maybe or like that She lays it down then she takes her scissors and she cuts it out now what's left over is called Remnant all right now what is this pattern how was it known the place that the lady elected to cut from right so you got to realize by the grace of God that that the remnant amen will be saved the foolish virgins will be saved they can't help it God cut and they were on the other side of it it was what God determined now you look at it's the truth Saul amen this is what I look at people I said well people don't understand this is what I was trying to say last week Saul amen was just Anointed with a little vow right and he typed out the denomination and organization of church why because they assumed God wanted them amen to to ordain themselves as a priesthood it's the TRU remember he said they sending them to schools they getting the ddds and ldds not even called by God oh come on somebody and because of it God has left them and you take David who do more sin but David was called by God and Saul was called by the people hello somebody and David messes up all alone one thing I love about David he knew how to repent Hallelujah he knew how to break down and say God forgive me hallelujah amen he knew how to exalt that word above him in spite of all of his failures he said God before the foundation world who knew the end from the beginning by for knowledge he elected where to cut he knowed the difference between Esa and Jacob hey somebody he know the difference between Sinner and Saint he knows the difference he knows the motive of every heart so he elected us before the foundation of the world put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life and also the lamb that was to be slain and put our names on before it was slain and the Bible said that Christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and our names were put on the book when he was elected back there to be the lamb to be slain and we were elected to be the one that he was slain for amen he said you see it now listen let me let me say it like this because if you can grass what God is saying to you this morning to the elect lady it it ought to leave you out here full of joy you're missing it if you're not being filled with joy right now if your joy faucet is not turned on something you're not hearing correctly Oh Glory to God and he goes on in the message Shalom and I love this why did he preach Shalom to a bride peace don't worry about it it's already in the bag it it's been fixed for you you don't you don't have to worry about what I'm doing just just follow through with this thing like I said receive the end of your faith amen right like the boy on on the bicycle on the board Hallelujah he wasn't looking down at the board and that's what a lot of us we constantly looking at all of our trials and our troubles it'll cause you to fall sir Hallelujah but if you look at the end results you stay steady you keep it steady you keep it steady Hallelujah no matter how how narrow the board is keep it steady amen right he says now New Year's message is to the church elected Jesus Christ he says not just the church group but the elect the lady the lady of the church Christ B see that's who I'm addressing now he's not talking to women or woman or a modernday woman he's talking to a lady and and listen what he said you remember brother said something has happened to the women in this day he said they used to be so Dy and so sweet and you know girly like you know they you you see something happening they the roles are changing and you know what he said it's not easy on them he said in their hearts they want to do it he said but there's a spirit pulling them hello somebody let me bring it to you it's in your heart to be meat it's in your heart to be lonly it's in your heart to be sweet it's in your heart to be gentle it's in your heart to be kind it's in your heart to love but the spirit of this world will pull you it'll pull you if you don't stay in his place presence see that's what happened to Eve she left the presence of Adam but as long as you stay in his presence Hallelujah he become your buckler he becomes your SE Shield Hallelujah he becomes your sword he becomes your what defense I read there Amen in the scripture the Bible said he'll be as flaming fire and smoke and all he said it'll be there as a defense it's not that he just did that he did that in the days of Noah Moses Hallelujah he was a pillar Cloud by day and a pillar Five By Night what was it a defense hallu a defense and he says himen that's way it is with a bride he said listen you've heard the scripture he said that we have a wall of fire about us what is that wall of fire but the Holy Ghost as a defense amen not one germ in this world can touch you amen unless God allows it to happen and believe you me if it does it's just for a test he said we're facing here in our two subjects that we are reading the two scriptures rather a very contrast one to the other it says arise and shine for the glory of God is to come upon you the light is here and then the very next it says gross Darkness is upon the people now what brother Ram is doing here he's basically trying to get you to see the time and day you're living in oh I can't I I tell you I get so excited because he's trying to show you you there's a light which is a supernatural light that's coming in a gross time and the light is for the seeds of God Amen and gross darkness is for the seed of the devil right gross darkness is upon the people and then we are in a mixery of light and darkness and then by my address to the church of Shalom which is peace amen we are facing this year both Darkness and Light and the world is is one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that ever stood in now you got to realize what God did and I love this because amen if the prophet of God was still on the scene we would have never come to see Jesus Christ as he is amen right so he takes the prophet off the scene which it appeared that the light was out he's gone there'll be no more of his teachings but what they fail to see is that Eternal Light can never be put out it could never die and what happened is those that light seed if I can say it like this was swn into the people's hearts so wherever they would walk amen they were bringing the light of God in the dark places and that's what you and I are supposed to do oh come on somebody amen and I tell you what it's like this if you riding down the road Amen in all a country road where there is no no light and all of a sudden you see light coming up hallelujah what does it do it gets your attention that's why when you walk at the places amen it might be dark before you get there but when you get there the light start shining and people start looking at you like what's going on here what is it it's that Supernatural light that's attracting them amen y'all hear what I'm saying and this Darkness this dark time has been set just for you cuz you must shine like the Stars come on somebody amen all around around you is Darkness but I tell you what not one star in the heaven is being defeated Hallelujah they're still breaking through that mass of Darkness amen elect Lady this is your position this is where you are you you're at the top of the pyramid you can I say it like this you're right at the top of the Bride tree the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the world water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness I believe that we are now living in that hour again that when God is what separating light from darkness and he's pressing it into the other side of the world and that the light might be made manifest now you and I must recognize that's why the light in the darkness is pressing fighting really within you am and never ever in the history of man or God Darkness overruled Hallelujah light will always destroy Darkness Hallelujah God fixed it that way come on somebody you better recognize it let me say it like this Samson didn't really know who he was until the pressure came and I'm going to tell you something that's exactly what happens to us a lot of time we forget who we are we forget what we came for

is that you've been elected and chosen of God and if you believe that God gave you that amen you can't believe it without God giving it to you you can't even receive the Holy Ghost unless God give you

Isaiah oh lord lord lord I got that down Isaiah 61 arise Shine for the light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross

coming amen amen because it's all for you to show the world who the light is oh come on somebody you got to recognize there going to be some super Supernatural things going on in here amen because remember when Jesus Christ was being put to the test amen and when when it was all said and done that Roman soldier said surely this was the light of the world surely this was the son of God surely all nature testified of who she who he was if it happened then it's got to happen again light has come to you God peace to you elected woman elect to the elected lady those who guard before the foundations world called out and ordained to that am oh come on let me break it down to you if you ordained to be a prophet you can't even get out of it you were born to be that Hallelujah brother brandham didn't even know who he was Hallelujah and God was working on him every amen from the age of three all the way up God visit and visit and visit and visit him Hallelujah let him have an experience of going to hell amen brought him back up and from that time on y'all hear what I'm saying God knows how to get you amen you might be stacking around and faking it till you make it Lord but I guarantee you if you're bride God knows how to shut it down for you and bring you back to your proper place he'll do it he'll make you look up amen he'll make you look down come on somebody oh thank God he said the rest of them will never see it they'll never know what what about nothing about it the Bible says so Jesus said no man would come to me except my father draws him first and the father giveth and the father has given me will come is that all right now listen he said there stood Judas light shining up here back in the heart was dark seed and when The Showdown come the darkness showed hey what's happening to people the darkness is showing I don't care they were around Jesus the whole time Judas oh come on somebody amen the Miracles the sign the wers the breaking of the bread amen but when The Showdown came look look at a time when people ought to be standing they're quitting at a time Judas should have stood he quit what was it that dark seed that thing in him wouldn't allow him to go no further come on somebody but not John oh not John John said I'll follow him everybody else scattered but John said I'm I'm going wherever they Le him I'll take him I'm going with him Hallelujah John was right there in the scene out of all of the disciples he never ran he never allowed the pressure to get to him that he disconnected himself to the Lord even in spite of the Romans persecution and John Was Right There When They Crucified him Hallelujah come on somebody John saw the whole scene that's why he says lead me to calary hallelujah amen you want to know him in the power of His suffering and his resurrection Hallelujah is that all right I love this amen it says for by Grace you are saved Hallelujah by Grace you are saved Lord we are saved not by what we can doen what we can or whatever we do is is not countered to us Grace is what save us amen by grace are you saved through faith is that all right and I'm going to shut down and just little he said but may I add this to this woman Grace may I place her in the Bible also is called the elected lady elect lady this misg Grace I'm going to talk about you know the Bible declares says to the elect lady that if you notice elect come from the word elected lady one lady among all the other ladies were elected like the Virgin was to bring forth the body of God on the earth she was an elected woman God chose Mary and also God has chosen an elected lady which is his bride she's elected I hope we're remembering of that to tonight let me put it this way so you can better understand cuz most of us have brothers and sisters most of us we have cousins uncles nephews and all and a lot of us are the only one saved brought into this message because of what election some of them may never get it but you got it yeah come on you got to see this you you didn't you was no better off you said you had the same bloodline you were capable of doing the same stuff everybody else was doing and some of us were amen but God had a jean seed on the inside of you that was placed there before the foundation of the world oh come on somebody and at that appointed time God called you my chosen like Rebecca elected by for knowledge God let me put it this way God knew what Abraham and Ela was going to ask him y'all don't believe that let let's put it this way brother brandham comes uh to uh uh hary W's house and he's telling her about all of the supernatural natur things that he done or God did through him right and all of a sudden inspired to me I can almost see had it right like a Hallelujah but she said that ain't nothing but the truth what was that that's was the Holy Ghost in hadie that was God Amen in himself she yielded to the Holy Ghost and then God said thus said the Lord give whatever she asked for now you got to recognize God knew what Haddie was going to ask for because those two boys was on his list Hallelujah those two boys was on his list and when she said he said you can ask for a million dollars you could ask for your sister to be healed he said she said but I want my boys Hallelujah and she spoke the mind of God and the power of the Holy Ghost come right now now I don't care what they doing right now they pass from left to death to life and God said they cannot die he didn't say they wouldn't backslide or whatever the case but he said they cannot die your judgment means nothing is what God judges it to be I'm going have to close but my point is I'm trying to bring I'm trying to come to a place because I want you to understand you so elect and if you could see this elected lady if you could see how blessed you are if you could see how much he loves you that this whole Bible was written laid on pages for you it tells up all about you as I I preach a couple of weeks ago under no circumstance will God not come for his bride nothing can hinder him from collecting you he don't care where you are he don't care how messed up your life is he don't care amen if you had six husbands if that seed genus on the inside of you God's coming for you and nothing can stop him he doesn't care what kind of mud you ought got in your life like I said the better the manure the battle the growth there nothing but the truth heyen is that all right let me just read one more quote he but to the elected to the elected God is calling to the elected they know it they know it God is calling to the elected they know it because you've responded to this message you know it you know it's right what got you standing now you know it's right where Paul said listen I know it's all right but how to perform it that's where I'm having problems because no man will be able to live it like Jesus himself and until you get Jesus on the inside you won't be able to live it amen they know it calling The Virtuous bride the word the last day Church the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus Christ word Jesus see if Jesus is the word how many believe that then the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it'll have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ amen let me put it again let me read that again it must see he say it have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ amen he promised to do it so it's not coming out of the denominations and organizations that make you bride it's going into ah amen amen you mean to tell me that God shook the whole of Egypt for two people because Joshua and Caleb was the only two that came in out of that he shook it yes the whole of Egypt for two and he'll do it again amen yeah never yes he says he says he promised to do it see he said how he did now uses or loses his pattern he always did it by the pattern he done it every time by the pattern he does it again calling out his virtuous bride in the last day the lovely Rebecca waiting for her ISAC what a beautiful time in other words if it took a Prophet by the name of Moses a Noah to call him out same way same pattern it took a Moses to call him out same pattern it took a Jesus to call him out same pattern it takes God in this last day by Prophet William brand again to call him out he cannot change his pattern let me show you how blessed you are maybe you don't recognize it by following this message because only those who follow Luther's message went in everything else was cut off that's the pattern come on somebody Hallelujah I don't care you see we may not understand it all he didn't say you had to but we following the messenger of the day and he steps beyond that and he goes in and says now I must decrease oh come on he must in in come on John says I got to go up and look Behold the Lamb what was he doing pointing to the pillar of fire Behold the Lamb Hallelujah follow this lamb if you don't if you miss the pointing to the lamb you still the pattern Cuts you got to follow the pillar of Fire amen W come on somebody and and people don't understand amen it's that pill of fire amen that's in you amen oh oh oh oh oh it is it's not above your head it's in you that's why he said you got to have a a back in the back of the desert experience you got to have a burning bush experience you got to know that the pill of fire is not it's just in the air but he on the inside of the heart right ring in your heart as Lord can I read one more and I'll let you go let let me finish this one first he said he how he did it right right he done it he done it every time by the pattern he does it again calling his virtuous bride in the last day the lovely Rebecca waiting for her Isaac what a beautiful time now he said other otherwise you're going to form what what to be known now she's invisible as to me as a bride see all right it'll go with you you will be part of me you'll be part of my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and his wife is one person you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me I just love that he listen what it says Satan just gets so angry at that Satan gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God see he gets so angry at that we ought to remind him right amen he's in me like the brother said at the picnic we need to torment Satan he torments us enough we need to torment him by declaring he's in me right he poured out is that all right people of God just like the husband he said now at that day you'll know that I'm in the father of the fathers in me I in you and you and me he said Satan just gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured it into Christ all that Christ was he poured it into the church there you are what did he pour into you what did he pour into you himself now what what is he working when he say pour in he's talking about nature the nature of God was in Christ the fullness of the nature of God was in Christ the fullness of oh come on somebody and the fullness of the nature of God was in Christ in that same nature he poured it into you by the Holy Ghost it's the nature that changes why would he say okay if you're a Cocker but if you put the nature of a weed in you you weed amen see it's the nature that God is saying you got to have I'm reading to you what he said elect lady you can have the Holy Ghost and grieve him you know you can grieve the Holy Ghost by not let him do what he wants to do in you but the Bible said he that begun a good work in you was faithful to complete it you may not be faithful but he's faithful how can you say to the Potter how you know how you know how how you going to form this clay this way y'all hear what I'm saying but if you don't work it he will work it I'll start this evening with the message she cannot die let's stand ain't God good to us you see I love this so much because it's taken out of the hands of man it's not in the hands of man this whole thing is in the hand of God it come on somebody we didn't understand it we do now right you say oh we didn't know it we didn't understand it it was always in his hands right but you got to recognize William brandom said I I wanted to kill him right he had his gun and and the gun wouldn't go off that was William Brandon but God was in control Hallelujah come on somebody brother Bram said I wanted to smoke but all of a sudden he heard that whoo What was it God was in control come on somebody who stop you from doing evil when you want to come on come on y'all like y'all ain't never been there before who stop you who runs the roadblocks who convicts you oh come on somebody nobody but the Lord Jesus why cuz he's in control he's going to have a bride without spot wrinkle of blemish she's elected to be so and I'm going to tell you something you are miss lady elected lady I believe with all my heart that this message come from almighty God and I tell you what somebody God's talking to this morning if not all of us some of us amen and I don't know about you he's talking to me amen telling me that he's elected me and and and this thing is not my my destiny is not not hinging upon what the Bishops or anybody else the pope or nobody else thinks about me it all is what he thought hallelujah hallelujah
