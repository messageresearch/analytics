[0:01] You don't get with this program without
[0:03] dying to yourself.
[0:06] Brother Benham said he said the man that
[0:09] has conquered himself,
[0:13] he said he has more power than the man
[0:14] that runs all over the building.
[0:19] Learn to conquer himself.
[0:23] We are as remember
[0:26] I can't even get past the first
[0:29] paragraph.
[0:33] He says and it's a dangerous hour. I'm
[0:36] going to just come down here. He says um
[0:39] that choice has to be made soon. He says
[0:41] it's a dangerous thing to wait till that
[0:42] last hour too because you might take on
[0:45] something you couldn't shake it out.
[0:54] Brother said, he said, "You say when
[0:56] that time comes, we'll we'll get out."
[0:58] He says, "You won't be able to."
[1:04] There's people,
[1:06] let me tell you, there's people
[1:09] that
[1:10] they've
[1:14] I'm going to put it this way. There's
[1:15] people that have spirits. Amen. Have um
[1:21] devils and demons working on them and in
[1:24] them moving,
[1:26] moving them.
[1:29] And I want to say this this morning,
[1:32] some people,
[1:34] they're absolutely fine with living that
[1:37] way.
[1:41] Because they'll still come to church.
[1:43] They'll act as religious as the next man
[1:45] or next
[1:48] But you always can tell
[1:51] the people
[1:54] that aren't interested in getting rid of
[1:55] their demons
[1:59] because the Holy Ghost will start to
[2:00] fall as the spirit of God begin moving
[2:04] and the altar call made or maybe there's
[2:08] maybe you can feel the presence of the
[2:09] Lord moving to you
[2:12] and they'll find a way to leave the
[2:14] sanctuary. they'll find something else
[2:16] to do. They'll start messing with their
[2:18] hair. They become uncomfortable in the
[2:21] presence of the Lord.
[2:23] Judah spirit all over again.
[2:26] Brother said he said Judas.
[2:29] He said he went through justification.
[2:31] He went
[2:34] to receive the
[2:38] time to do that.
[2:40] That same spirit
[2:42] today
[2:44] with the work.
[3:01] They're not going to do that.
[3:03] [Music]
[3:04] Why would the devil leave when he you
[3:07] made him so comfortable to stay?
[3:11] And I wonder sometimes because
[3:15] I'm talking about you might maybe one of
[3:17] he said one of these days you'll wish
[3:19] you could go to a Holy Ghost meeting.
[3:22] He said one of these days you'll wish
[3:24] you could open up that old him book
[3:26] again.
[3:28] He said, "But that time will be over."
[3:32] [Music]
[3:33] This is incredible, brother. He said,
[3:35] "One of these days," he said, "the
[3:36] rapture will have happened."
[3:39] Do you realize when the bride is taken
[3:41] up, the Holy Spirit leaves?
[3:45] Brother, when that bride leaves, the
[3:47] Holy Spirit comes,
[3:49] then it's poured out all the Jews. There
[3:51] will be no more Gentiles.
[3:55] After that time comes,
[3:57] He says, "People will go to church.
[4:01] They'll just keep on going to church.
[4:04] They'll keep doing their thing."
[4:07] Some said they didn't even miss the Holy
[4:09] Spirit in their services cuz they never
[4:10] had
[4:17] they just kept singing, preaching, and
[4:19] the Holy Spirit wasn't there. The
[4:23] missing
[4:25] after the rapture, he said, "The service
[4:28] go out to drink coffee after
[4:31] and say, "Brother, wasn't that a great
[4:33] service and have no idea that the Holy
[4:36] Spirit won the whole
[4:39] vain do they worship me, preaching for
[4:42] doctrines, the commandments of menop
[4:50] you talk about a showdown, brother,
[4:51] there's a showdown coming
[4:54] down
[4:57] I'll tell you what, there's going to be
[4:58] a lot of people surprised.
[5:00] Going to be a lot of people going to be
[5:02] shocked.
[5:04] But I'll tell you one group that won't
[5:06] be surprised. I'll tell you one group
[5:09] that won't be
[5:23] shocked.
[5:25] said for the true bride. He said, he
[5:28] said the rapture will just be a regular
[5:31] routine of following the
[5:35] routine.
[5:37] She's been following the sheet music the
[5:39] whole time.
[5:43] You know, a real good musician, no
[5:44] matter what you do, you can't throw them
[5:47] off.
[5:49] You ever notice a good musician? No
[5:51] matter what happens, the singer miss a
[5:54] note, the singer miss a word, the music
[5:56] don't stop.
[5:58] Just keep on playing.
[6:02] Glory to another message.
[6:07] God's great symptom. All right.
[6:09] And it's
[6:10] brother, the point I'm getting at is
[6:12] that people will wait till the last
[6:14] possible moment.
[6:21] You know the Bible says that adulterers,
[6:23] fornicators, it names
[6:25] they will not be names they will not be
[6:28] in heaven.
[6:32] If you for if you commit one of these
[6:34] you commit adultery or you commit
[6:36] that don't automatically make you an
[6:38] adulterer or
[6:40] you can repent, get right, God will
[6:42] forgive you and you can go on living
[6:44] right with God.
[6:48] But brother, what makes you an adulter
[6:51] is when you do that thing and you
[6:53] continue to do that
[6:57] and what happens after a while that
[6:59] spirit don't want to leave
[7:02] that spirit and you have become one.
[7:06] You are now an adulterer. You are now a
[7:08] fornicator. You are now this other you
[7:11] are now a liar,
[7:13] an addict or you are some brother You
[7:17] you want to keep that thing going.
[7:20] You want to get right. You want to die.
[7:22] Pretty soon that thing won't leave.
[7:25] Amen.
[7:26] You remember that maniac that came into
[7:28] brother's meeting.
[7:30] He said he was stormy. He was telling me
[7:31] I was I was a snake in the grass.
[7:36] Said the Holy Spirit came down and said,
[7:38] "Because you have challenged the Holy
[7:40] Spirit, tonight you'll fall over my
[7:42] feet."
[7:42] Amen, sir.
[7:44] Amen.
[7:44] Amen. Right.
[7:49] Remember brother brother said he fell
[7:51] till the deacons had to roll him off of
[7:53] my feet.
[7:58] Amen.
[7:58] Brother said they asked they say is he
[8:00] dead?
[8:02] He said no.
[8:05] He said well is that spirit God?
[8:10] He says he loves that spirit.
[8:13] said as soon as he wakes up that spirit
[8:16] will come right back to him
[8:18] because he loves
[8:20] brother. It goes to show you could pray
[8:22] a spirit off you by faith. You can pray
[8:24] a spirit off a person. God honors faith
[8:26] that thing will come. That thing will
[8:28] leave.
[8:29] But if you don't want it gone, that
[8:31] thing will come right back.
[8:34] You remember when the spirit has left,
[8:36] brother, this has nothing to do with
[8:38] when the spirit has left a person,
[8:40] it walks through dry places.
[8:43] seeking rest. It doesn't find it.
[8:46] It goes back to the house where it came
[8:48] from and it finds it swept
[8:51] and
[8:55] it's not full of anything.
[9:00] Here is the problem
[9:02] that many people empty out at the altar.
[9:07] Many people empty out during the
[9:09] service. Oh, they cry.
[9:11] Lord, I'll be forgiven.
[9:14] You should do that.
[9:16] You don't ever get up.
[9:24] And the state of that man is worse than
[9:27] the first.
[9:31] I didn't like the one demon that was in
[9:33] me.
[9:36] How about him and seven demons worse
[9:38] than himself? He ain't coming back
[9:40] alone. He came back with somebody.
[9:46] Amen.
[9:47] Remember what Jesus told her? He told
[9:48] that he said, "Go your way. Sin no more.
[9:52] Lest the worst thing come upon you."
[9:54] We are one that should be
[9:58] right.
[10:00] He said
[10:02] he said it's a dangerous thing to wait
[10:04] till that last hour or two
[10:07] because you might take on something that
[10:09] you could never shake out of it.
[10:13] Today you hear his voice
[10:17] hard in your heart
[10:19] in the days when they provoke God to
[10:21] anger. Don't do it.
[10:22] Don't do it.
[10:25] Oh yes.
[10:28] He says, you know, there is a time when
[10:30] you can be warned.
[10:33] But I believe many people are going
[10:34] through that time of warning right now.
[10:36] That's what you know that brother Vanam
[10:39] said, he pointed out that a New
[10:40] Testament prophet is a preacher to
[10:44] prophesy is to foretell or to tell
[10:46] forth. You know that every time
[10:49] that a God called minister is behind the
[10:51] pulpit preaching you, he's prophesying
[10:53] through you. He's telling forth this
[10:56] word, brother. It's to help you,
[10:59] to tell you when you're wrong so that
[11:02] you can get right.
[11:05] Many people leave mad after a service
[11:07] when the pastors really come down
[11:09] something
[11:11] and start saying, "Lord, thank you for
[11:13] your grace.
[11:14] Thank you for your mercy
[11:17] because I was going on
[11:20] to the world.
[11:26] Amen.
[11:26] Yes, sir.
[11:28] He says, you know, there's a time when
[11:30] you can be warned.
[11:33] Then if you step across that line of
[11:34] warning,
[11:36] then you're already marked on the other
[11:38] side.
[11:45] My advice to you,
[11:49] when God speaks to your heart,
[11:54] you act right then. Yes, sir.
[11:57] Amen.
[11:58] You say, "Well, brother,
[12:00] the preacher's in the middle of his
[12:01] message." No, you respond right. I was
[12:05] in a youth service one time years ago. I
[12:09] wasn't even married.
[12:12] So it's been
[12:15] probably 13 years back or
[12:19] 13 14 years back.
[12:22] Brother,
[12:23] my dad was speaking.
[12:25] I'm not saying it because it was my dad.
[12:27] He just happened to be.
[12:31] He was maybe 30 minutes into his
[12:33] message.
[12:35] My dad preached an hour and a half, two
[12:36] hours sometimes. He was maybe 30. He was
[12:40] maybe about a half hour in.
[12:44] He didn't ask for anybody to come. He
[12:46] didn't make an alter call.
[12:50] He had made a statement for brother. He
[12:53] said, "How many be willing to lay aside
[12:55] all of yourself
[12:58] to give all yourself to the Lord?"
[13:00] That's all he said. I promise you, he
[13:03] probably still had at least another 30,
[13:06] 40 minutes left.
[13:09] I don't know. I've never been in a
[13:11] service quite like that.
[13:14] But it was like God put a magnet at the
[13:16] altar.
[13:19] You might have not even been planning on
[13:20] going to the altar.
[13:24] He made that statement.
[13:26] And with my hand raised to heaven this
[13:27] morning,
[13:29] every single young person, there was
[13:30] probably at least 60 young people in
[13:32] that room. Every single young person ran
[13:35] to the altar. Praise God.
[13:38] Every one of them.
[13:41] Um,
[13:41] brother, you could have seen it. Maybe
[13:44] there were people pushing one another
[13:46] trying to get there. Who could get there
[13:48] quicker? There were people, you know,
[13:50] brother made the statement.
[13:52] He said, "If hell could open up its
[13:54] doors,
[13:56] he said you'd never have to make an
[13:58] altar call."
[14:02] He said, "If hell could open up," He
[14:04] said, "You'd never have to make an altar
[14:05] call.
[14:07] He said they would be coming out of
[14:09] there crawling over one another
[14:14] to get to the service you won't go to
[14:19] to get to the altar that you won't go
[14:21] toward.
[14:28] He says because they've realized there
[14:31] in that place just how wrong they were.
[14:36] just how defeated they were.
[14:40] He said they have the same opportunity
[14:42] you do tonight.
[14:46] They have the they have the same
[14:48] opportunity you do this morning.
[14:52] Amen.
[14:53] He said, "But they pass beyond mercy.
[14:55] They'll never be redeemed."
[15:02] He says, "You wouldn't want to take
[15:03] their place.
[15:07] He says, "Then why not take your place
[15:09] with the redeemed?"
[15:13] But I'm telling you this morning, I got
[15:16] past one page, there's a Mount Carmel
[15:18] experience going on right here.
[15:21] People are making choices.
[15:25] People are making decisions.
[15:27] Every time this word is preached, you
[15:29] have to make a decision.
[15:31] You have to make a decision whether
[15:33] you're going to receive it.
[15:37] What are you going to do about this
[15:38] word?
[15:40] You going to live it
[15:42] or just the parts that are easy or just
[15:45] the parts that are convenient to your
[15:47] lifestyle.
[15:51] Tell you what, you can't live this word
[15:52] of God without the Holy Ghost.
[16:00] Amen.
[16:03] Amen. Amen.
[16:04] That's the truth.
[16:05] Can't do it.
[16:07] How could you do it without the life
[16:09] that wrote this word in you? You
[16:11] couldn't.
[16:15] You know that God gave the children of
[16:17] Israel a life
[16:20] knowing they couldn't live it.
[16:23] He gave them something to keep that he
[16:25] know they couldn't keep.
[16:28] He knew the frailty of human beings. He
[16:31] knew they couldn't keep it.
[16:33] He knew they were going to fail. He knew
[16:35] they were going to fall.
[16:40] And he gave them it anyways and said
[16:41] keep it knowing they were
[16:46] true brother. Amen.
[16:47] Right.
[16:48] That's true.
[16:49] They were written on tables of stone.
[16:54] Brother, you can't roll it up like a
[16:55] scroll.
[16:58] You either keep them or you break them.
[17:02] There is no stone.
[17:04] Aren't you thankful that now the tables
[17:07] of the heart
[17:10] came?
[17:16] God knew you couldn't live this word.
[17:20] God knew you could just as much as you
[17:21] could make it to service on time this
[17:23] morning.
[17:30] Amen.
[17:30] Amen.
[17:32] But the lamb in you can live it.
[17:40] He that is born of God does not commit
[17:43] sin.
[17:45] The sea of God remains here.
[17:50] to go there.
[17:58] As a human being, I couldn't keep
[18:00] myself.
[18:06] It keeps me from sin and it keeps me.
[18:12] God works through the blood and he sees
[18:14] perfection.
[18:19] Amen.
[18:20] That's right.
[18:20] Hallelujah.
[18:21] But that's why we ought to be striving
[18:23] daily to get
[18:25] to get those in.
[18:30] Amen.
[18:31] Diligently seeking diligently working
[18:38] because brother without that there is no
[18:40] rapture for you.
[18:43] There is no seal. There is no adoption.
[18:47] That's why you find many people in and
[18:49] out of church all the time. In and out
[18:51] and out back and forth.
[18:54] One day they're good, one day they're
[18:56] mad. One day they're losing, one day
[18:57] they're not.
[18:59] I said it matters where you're eating it
[19:01] at. It matters if you have the
[19:09] Amen.
[19:10] Oh, we're tired of hearing that word.
[19:12] Sound like something familiar? Oh, we're
[19:14] tired of hear the pastor preach the same
[19:16] thing. We just preach same scripture,
[19:20] same old stuff. Sound like the children
[19:22] of Israel, same old man.
[19:27] Where is this life bread? All this
[19:30] matter was kind of this.
[19:33] You know when it gets old,
[19:36] I say, you know, when it gets old, when
[19:38] you don't want to hear it no more.
[19:42] When you don't want to hear it,
[19:57] it's not warmed over to you. It's just
[19:59] as fresh as the first day.
[20:11] Don't remove the ancient landmarks that
[20:14] were set.
[20:19] You know, he says, he's talking about
[20:21] the woman that lost that coin. He says,
[20:23] "We haven't lost one." He says, "We've
[20:25] practically lost all of them.
[20:29] Brother, there haven't been one landmark
[20:31] taken out. There's been almost all of
[20:33] them taken out.
[20:36] Where do you even find hardly anybody
[20:38] that'll stand for everything that this
[20:40] prophet said regardless of understand?
[20:46] You can't do that without the Holy
[20:48] Ghost. I promise you that.
[20:51] I promise you that.
[20:53] Thank you, Lord.
[20:54] Watch. She says, "We're going to let's
[20:56] true sign that's overlooked." 61. When
[20:58] Elijah then called for a showdown
[21:02] spectacular
[21:10] and called for a showdown, said, "If God
[21:12] be God, serve him.
[21:14] If Bao be God, serve him."
[21:21] He said, "Couldn't that be a wonderful
[21:22] day for Elijah today?
[21:25] be a wonderful thing for the Elijah
[21:26] today. How many knows who our Elijah
[21:28] was?
[21:29] Yes, sir.
[21:31] Absolutely. Look,
[21:34] he said,
[21:36] "If God's God, serve him. If Baal be
[21:38] God, serve him."
[21:42] A double-minded man is unstable in all
[21:44] of his ways.
[21:47] What Elijah, when he stepped out, he
[21:48] said, "How long halt you between two
[21:50] opinions?
[21:54] I bet you there's people here this
[21:55] morning halted between two opinions. Man
[21:58] made a decision on what they believe in.
[22:00] They're halted between two different
[22:01] things.
[22:04] You know the brother random said that
[22:05] God act in the beginning when the battle
[22:08] happened in heaven.
[22:10] You know that actually twothirds of the
[22:12] angels were deceived.
[22:14] Not just one
[22:17] because there was a group that couldn't
[22:18] like their minds.
[22:22] There was a group that was totally
[22:24] deceived.
[22:25] There was another group that couldn't
[22:26] quite make up their minds.
[22:28] And there was another group that fought
[22:30] with Michael.
[22:32] I don't know about you, but I just
[22:33] believe I'm one of those Michael.
[22:36] I'm one of those that fought with
[22:37] Michael. I just
[22:39] I just believe it that way.
[22:42] But there was another group that
[22:43] couldn't quite make up their minds.
[22:46] No, brother said, "The foolish virgin is
[22:48] absolutely deceived of the devil and
[22:50] doesn't know it.
[22:53] I'm just going to leave it there. I'm
[22:55] just going to leave it there.
[22:57] I'm just going to leave that there.
[23:00] Amen.
[23:00] Amen.
[23:02] Yes, sir.
[23:06] You better choose what God you're going
[23:07] to serve.
[23:09] So, brother, I made that decision long
[23:11] ago. I've always believed in God. Ever
[23:12] since I was
[23:14] two years old, I believed in God.
[23:17] No doubt up here you believed in God.
[23:20] But brother, you show what you believe
[23:22] by what life you live. That shows what
[23:24] you really believe.
[23:28] Amen.
[23:30] You show what revelation you have by
[23:32] what life you live.
[23:36] Anybody can believe a lot of things up
[23:38] here can say a lot of things here. But
[23:40] you prove what it is you do believe by
[23:43] what kind of a life you live. By their
[23:45] fruits you shall know,
[23:48] not by what they say with their mouth.
[23:50] By their fruits,
[23:53] brother Adam said, "What we need in
[23:54] Jeffersonville is thousands of lived
[23:56] voices."
[23:59] We don't need a lot of people saying a
[24:01] lot of things. We need people a lot of
[24:03] things.
[24:06] That's the hugest hindrance to the
[24:08] message churches, the Christian church
[24:10] of today is lives that aren't lived
[24:13] according to what they preach.
[24:19] We talk about victory. We talk about
[24:21] Holy Ghost. We talk about a life. We
[24:23] talk and then go outside and live
[24:25] contrary to what we just said.
[24:28] Contrary to what we just raised our
[24:29] hand.
[24:33] Amen.
[24:34] Amen.
[24:36] Dance all you want, shout all you want,
[24:38] and then go inside and say something
[24:40] that'll split a church.
[24:43] Show what kind of spirit you really
[24:48] I might feel a lot of things as a human
[24:50] being, but guess what? If the spirit of
[24:53] God is in me, it's going to cancel all
[24:54] that out.
[24:57] You want to cancel somebody, cancel
[24:59] yourself.
[25:03] You should cancel yourself.
[25:07] My brother don't give me problems. My
[25:09] sister don't give me problems. My pastor
[25:11] don't give me problems.
[25:19] Your brother, your sister, your child,
[25:21] your family.
[25:26] Well, brother, all my family this way
[25:28] this way. Yeah. All the way back to
[25:30] Adam. You can all you can change it all
[25:32] the way.
[25:32] I don't sure, but how long are you going
[25:34] to blame it on Adam?
[25:38] Amen.
[25:39] Yeah. I believe God gave us this message
[25:41] to rise above.
[25:47] The blood gives us power to rise above
[25:49] the fall.
[25:51] To rise above
[25:54] the
[25:55] Do you realize the new birth takes care
[25:56] of family curses?
[26:04] Hallelujah.
[26:12] Yes, sir.
[26:12] Amen.
[26:14] Amen.
[26:15] Amen.
[26:16] Well, this happened and that happened.
[26:19] What does that have to do with you?
[26:24] Come on.
[26:25] Don't tell me you're going to get there
[26:26] in that day and say, "Lord, the reason I
[26:28] couldn't do it was because of all the
[26:30] hypocrites."
[26:35] What does that have to do with
[26:40] this one didn't limit and he claimed to
[26:42] be this couldn't do it.
[26:46] What did that have to do with
[26:49] a personal experience?
[26:53] No. based on what this person did to
[26:55] that person. You still got your eyes on
[26:57] Miss Jones.
[26:59] You still got your eyes on Miss Jones.
[27:03] But what about you?
[27:06] What are you going to do?
[27:10] What are you going to do when they say
[27:11] bow to that idol?
[27:15] You going to bow down with the rest of
[27:16] them
[27:19] or regardless you're going to stand. You
[27:21] know that brother said Daniel
[27:25] and Shadrach, he said they kept the
[27:27] victory with no home church to go to
[27:33] have a hym book to sing from.
[27:36] They didn't have a screen for him and
[27:39] read words.
[27:41] But you go to some churches, they can't
[27:43] even open their mouth and there's a
[27:44] screen with words on it.
[27:46] Amazing
[27:49] grace that people still sit there with
[27:51] their lips
[27:52] never
[27:57] in the right place of God.
[28:14] Don't tell me not to praise my God.
[28:18] Amen.
[28:23] [Music]
[28:29] [Music]
[28:36] Amen.
[28:38] Amen.
[28:39] Shut up, devil.
[28:43] [Applause]
[28:44] Amen. save my Elijah.
[28:52] Hallelujah.
[28:53] Amen.
[28:53] Brother, he got up there.
[28:55] He said, "Now, I'm going to let you go
[28:57] first."
[28:59] He said, "I'm going to let you guys go
[29:01] first."
[29:02] You guys go ahead and do your thing, and
[29:04] I'll wait back here and just wait for
[29:06] you all to be.
[29:09] But they got up there, they lanced
[29:11] themselves, they cut one another, they
[29:13] yelled, they scream.
[29:17] like a lot of pet people today in
[29:19] churches.
[29:20] Oh, sure.
[29:21] They scream, they shout, they cry.
[29:24] They do it all.
[29:27] Laughing against those things, brother.
[29:28] I I want those things in the church.
[29:30] Holy things. I have no problem with
[29:32] sitting, dancing, rolling, screaming,
[29:35] hopping chairs, throwing chairs. You do
[29:37] whatever the Holy Spirit puts on. I've
[29:39] seen it all, brother. I've seen people
[29:40] crawl around making noise. I've heard
[29:43] the whole night. And you know what,
[29:44] brother? I don't I don't mind it. As
[29:46] long as it's the Holy Spirit doing it in
[29:48] you, I don't care.
[29:50] Amen.
[29:50] But brother, when you can do all that
[29:52] and the God of heaven not behind
[29:54] anything you're doing with it,
[29:58] that's why brother was always on the
[30:00] Pentecostals, there was nothing wrong
[30:02] with their joy. What was wrong with it
[30:03] is they didn't have a life to back it
[30:05] up.
[30:07] You left the word. You've left the life.
[30:14] the life
[30:15] that was very uh brother John back there
[30:18] he was teaching the Sunday school
[30:20] earlier on Samson
[30:23] says you let out the secret
[30:26] that's why the gloryy's gone he said you
[30:28] let out the secret
[30:30] was that godly life you were living
[30:33] [Music]
[30:34] without holiness no man shall see God
[30:38] and brother without holiness in the
[30:39] church you shall not move and you
[30:45] One one person out alive can cause an
[30:47] entire church to fail.
[30:51] He said it could cause someone.
[30:54] [Music]
[30:57] I don't want that on my record.
[31:01] I just didn't feel like worship today.
[31:05] Then you ought to apologize to the
[31:07] families who kids didn't receive the
[31:09] Holy Ghost because you just didn't feel
[31:10] like worship.
[31:16] I didn't feel like I feel like I feel
[31:18] like
[31:21] you got to apologize to the parents that
[31:24] their kids didn't get what they needed
[31:26] to out of service because
[31:31] God is good. He's sovereign in spite of
[31:34] our failures and our misfort.
[31:39] Amen.
[31:41] Aren't you thankful for that?
[31:43] Many times we get nothing.
[31:46] We get nothing, brother sister.
[31:48] Yes. Amen.
[31:49] Lord.
[31:50] Oh my.
[31:51] Elijah, he was he was confident,
[31:53] brother.
[31:55] Amen.
[31:58] Let me I'll tell you the other side of
[31:59] this, too. Those people put forth more
[32:03] effort
[32:06] and more because the Bible says they
[32:08] they did that all the way to the evening
[32:10] sacrifices. They did all that all the
[32:12] way. It was time for the evening
[32:14] service.
[32:18] They cut themselves, worshiped, did all
[32:20] their till it was time for an evening
[32:22] service.
[32:23] But they put forth more effort and gave
[32:25] more of their time than most people that
[32:27] call themselves message believers. Amen.
[32:32] But
[32:32] if they've got anything else going on,
[32:34] they just ain't going to be in church.
[32:38] Maybe this is stuff for the pastor to
[32:39] say, but I'm just I'm just saying it as
[32:41] it comes.
[32:46] You got anything else going on? We just
[32:47] won't be at church today.
[32:50] I got something else. You got something
[32:51] else.
[32:52] You got something else that's more
[32:54] important than coming to the house. You
[32:55] got something else.
[32:57] But I want to know what you're doing.
[33:00] It's that much better and that much more
[33:02] important. I want to know what you're
[33:03] doing.
[33:04] Shoot. I'm I'm in the wrong institute.
[33:07] I'm
[33:08] I'm doing the wrong thing. I didn't know
[33:09] what you're doing.
[33:10] Apparently, it's more important and more
[33:13] than going to the house of the Lord. I
[33:15] don't know what it is. It must be the
[33:17] funniest thing I've ever had going on.
[33:21] It was much much more important than
[33:22] eternal life.
[33:25] Right. Right.
[33:27] Brother said it mattered where you went
[33:28] to church.
[33:29] It mattered who taught you.
[33:32] He said you ought to seek out the very
[33:33] best.
[33:36] That's a slap in the face to your
[33:37] pastor. You don't show up because you
[33:39] had something else you had going on.
[33:42] You're telling him, "I don't feel like
[33:43] you're the very best."
[33:46] Well, you want to find somewhere you
[33:48] like going.
[33:50] You got to find somewhere that you want
[33:51] to come to.
[33:56] They did their thing.
[33:58] Elijah tells them, "Hey, maybe your
[33:59] God's asleep. Maybe he's gone fishing.
[34:02] Maybe he's done this or that." They cry
[34:04] loud. Cry loud. They do.
[34:07] They cut each other more. Then all this
[34:10] stuff going on.
[34:13] But then it came time for the offering
[34:15] of the evil.
[34:18] Amen.
[34:19] It came time for the real thing.
[34:24] And at that time,
[34:26] all the things they were doing went,
[34:29] "Amen."
[34:30] All their hollering, all their
[34:32] screaming, all their worship went.
[34:36] Now it's time for God to action.
[34:39] And when they stop,
[34:43] you might come to find out, God's
[34:45] waiting for you to stop talking. So,
[34:48] he's waiting for you to stop screaming,
[34:50] will he?
[34:53] Amen. Amen.
[34:57] Oh, hallelujah.
[34:59] Yes, sir.
[35:00] Now came time for the evening sacri the
[35:03] evening time.
[35:05] Now it came time for the evening time.
[35:10] And all their thing.
[35:15] Now it's time for Elijah to speak. But I
[35:17] said, "When the lion roars in the
[35:19] forest, everything else shall."
[35:22] Now, after the lion roars, maybe it's
[35:23] time to prophesy. But while he's
[35:25] roaring,
[35:27] you know, when brother was here
[35:30] speaking, doing things,
[35:35] just in my mind, I believe no one else
[35:37] had a right to be on the field.
[35:39] I know they had their place, but brother
[35:42] the prophet of the ages on the field,
[35:45] it's time for me to turn my attention
[35:47] towards what God
[35:49] is speaking.
[35:53] But when Elijah left, guess what?
[35:56] It was time for Elisha to pick up on
[36:00] continue preaching this word and
[36:02] continue
[36:05] and continue on.
[36:07] Amen. Amen.
[36:09] Hallelujah.
[36:11] The lion has roared. Who can but
[36:12] prophesy?
[36:14] While he's roaring, I don't want to say
[36:16] anything.
[36:18] But after he's roared,
[36:20] now it's time to tell forth.
[36:22] Time to prophesy again.
[36:26] Time to read the book.
[36:29] Listen, he was brother said he was
[36:31] certain of God. He was certain where he
[36:33] stood. When it came time, he said, "Give
[36:35] me put all the altar together." He
[36:37] rolled those stones together. There'll
[36:39] be no schism in the body, brother. He
[36:41] rolled the whole thing together.
[36:44] And he was so calm, he said, "Pour on
[36:45] some water.
[36:48] I don't need this thing to be dry. Go
[36:50] ahead and pour it on,
[36:51] brother." He went through three pools of
[36:53] water.
[36:55] He went through three pools of water
[36:58] and he poured it on.
[37:01] Amen.
[37:02] And he said, "Okay. Now we'll do that.
[37:06] Lord,
[37:07] according to your word,
[37:10] oh brother, sister, do you realize
[37:13] notice also he said, Lord God,
[37:16] of Abraham,
[37:17] Abraham,
[37:17] Isaac,
[37:19] he didn't say of Jacob.
[37:22] He said, "And of Israel,"
[37:25] he didn't use his deceiver name.
[37:29] He used the name God had given.
[37:32] Oh brother, you might have the rest of
[37:34] the family might only remember your past
[37:36] and who you were. They only remember the
[37:38] guy that used to be old that used to be
[37:48] Jesus.
[38:03] I will do a new thing among you.
[38:07] I will do a new thing among you.
[38:10] And then I'll put your name
[38:13] and then I'll write it in white stone.
[38:18] [Applause]
[38:21] And the rest of the world may not know
[38:23] it, but you'll know it. God gave it to
[38:26] you. It's a personal revelation to you.
[38:30] I know the forgiveness of sins.
[38:43] Amen.
[38:44] Praise God.
[38:47] Amen.
[38:48] Said, "Lord, I did this all at your
[38:49] word.
[38:52] I did all this at your word. Lord, I
[38:53] don't know what else to do.
[38:55] I didn't do this of my own accord.
[38:58] I didn't do it cuz I woke up today and
[38:59] said, you know what? I'm going to go out
[39:01] here and just do some wonderful things.
[39:04] I did all this at your word, Lord.
[39:06] At this point, it's all up to you cuz I
[39:09] did everything you told me to do."
[39:12] Brother said, he said, "When Moses got
[39:13] to that Red Sea,
[39:17] He said it wasn't Moses's job to open up
[39:19] the Red Sea.
[39:20] No, sir.
[39:22] Those are things I can do. You know,
[39:25] everybody in this building could blow as
[39:26] hard as they want at a sea somewhere and
[39:28] that thing ain't going to open nowhere.
[39:32] Brother, there's things only God can do.
[39:36] Only God can do.
[39:40] He said it's not your job to open the
[39:41] sea. It's not your job to speak in the
[39:46] job speak
[39:59] when you met God's conditions. Call for
[40:04] it.
[40:06] Brother, if you call for fire and it
[40:08] don't fall, go back and check. Roll over
[40:11] every stone. Make sure you condition
[40:16] because he said if you did, you could
[40:18] call for
[40:22] a
[40:23] I'm not taking the prophet's place, but
[40:25] I do want to take mine.
[40:27] I don't believe in taking brother
[40:29] Benham's place,
[40:30] but I do believe in taking mine.
[40:33] Amen.
[40:34] Amen.
[40:37] on my gospel again.
[40:39] Amen.
[40:41] Amen.
[40:42] I don't want to be more than what God's
[40:43] called me to be, but I definitely don't
[40:44] want to be less than what God's called
[40:46] me to be.
[40:49] You're the man who said she'll speak and
[40:50] it'll flash.
[40:53] Did he say it?
[40:54] Anybody ever seen lightning flash?
[40:57] Pretty bright,
[40:59] pretty loud.
[41:02] They'll speak and they'll flash.
[41:05] like
[41:07] he said, "One of these days the sons of
[41:08] God will speak and their word will be
[41:10] backed."
[41:11] Not praying anymore.
[41:13] The third is not
[41:18] pray.
[41:20] We've done that for years.
[41:28] Hallelujah.
[41:35] It's a miracle every
[41:41] day.
[41:43] The Bible says when Paul and Silas
[41:47] [Applause]
[41:53] were single.
[42:00] Amen.
[42:05] Amen.
[42:07] The earth begin
[42:10] [Applause]
[42:23] [Applause]
[42:23] [Music]
[42:27] look at that scripture again. It says
[42:28] suddenly
[42:32] Paul inside and a couple weeks later
[42:38] and suddenly
[42:41] I sure likely
[42:47] wasn't even expecting it.
[42:51] Maybe there weren't even
[42:54] [Applause]
[42:56] for 10 days.
[42:58] didn't even know what it was.
[43:05] We didn't even know
[43:10] God.
[43:17] [Applause]
[43:22] Amen. Amen.
[43:25] Right. Gandhi
[43:33] [Applause]
[43:36] in my nose, but God's gone down
[43:38] somewhere this morning.
[43:39] Thank you, Lord.
[43:41] Praise God.
[43:41] Glory to God.

[44:07] Yes, sir.
[44:08] Where are you at this morning? Where's
[44:10] your faith this morning?
[44:12] There's a showdown right here this
[44:13] morning. Carnal experience going on this
[44:16] morning.
[44:17] People are making decisions. People are
[44:19] decision.
[44:19] Go see where your faith is or not.
[44:22] see where you're really at or not.
[44:25] But you can't claim all kinds of stuff
[44:27] and not live any of it.
[44:30] I want to claim what my name is on.
[44:33] I don't want to claim anything else.
[44:35] I don't want to be nothing that I ain't
[44:37] called to be. I tell you, the Lord is
[44:39] here this morning.
[44:41] I believe if you'll speak out loud what
[44:43] your need is, I believe God will need it
[44:45] right now wherever you
[44:47] at this morning.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:53] Oh, glory to God.

[46:04] receive Christ.

[48:10] the Lord
[48:12] as he
[48:15] go. Oh, reach out. Reach out and touch
[48:21] the Lord.
[48:23] [Music]
[48:27] Oh, you might
[48:31] not be
[48:33] to hear
[48:37] [Music]
[48:51] and touch the Lord.
[48:55] as he
[48:58] [Music]
[49:00] reach out. Reach out and touch the Lord
[49:06] as he
[49:09] Anybody want that mountain,
[49:13] [Applause]
[49:19] you and the enemy. Hallelujah. If God is
[49:23] moving here this morning,
[49:25] don't let the devil block your mind.
[49:29] Think about it now.
[49:31] Think about it.
[49:33] You have an opportunity
[49:36] to be with God right now,
[49:39] not tomorrow, right now.
[49:43] Amen. The Lord spoke this morning.
[49:46] Those of you who are
[49:49] in caves by hand,
[49:52] God is here this morning
[49:55] to set you free.
[49:58] Don't let the devil keep you bound.
[50:01] Hallelujah.
[50:02] Don't be ashamed.
[50:05] Every man and woman for themselves.
[50:08] Hallelujah.
[50:10] Think about what he said.
[50:11] Think about what God said. Was that was
[50:14] Was that a warning?
[50:17] If those souls in hell,
[50:21] if the door was open to save
[50:25] the would even need an altar.
[50:29] [Music]
[50:30] Hallelujah.
[50:32] Amen. Think about it.
[50:34] Every soldiers in hell
[50:38] they were
[50:41] [Music]
[50:44] you don't know if this is your last
[50:46] moment
[50:48] last day. You don't even know if this is
[50:51] your last hour
[50:54] saying come
[50:56] to me all you that are
[51:03] Hallelujah.
[51:04] Without the Holy Ghost,
[51:07] can't make it.
[51:09] Without the Holy Ghost,
[51:11] you won't take it.
[51:12] Hallelujah. You need God.
[51:16] Amen.
[51:17] Those of you,
[51:19] you need an extra portion. You just need
[51:22] the devil, Holy Ghost. You just allow
[51:25] Satan to you.
[51:28] Whatever the case may be God's portion
[51:31] this morning by the spirit of God.
[51:34] Hallelujah. I don't know whether you can
[51:37] feel him, but I can truly tell you that
[51:40] he's here. He's right here. He's going
[51:43] to do something for you.
[51:47] Don't let the enemy put you in your
[51:50] seat.
[51:51] Lord don't have the joy that they used
[51:54] to have, but God is here to give you the
[51:57] joy. You say, "God, I don't have the
[52:00] victory I used to have, but God is here
[52:03] to give you the victory." Hallelujah.
[52:06] God, I don't have the peace I used to
[52:09] have, but God is here to give you the
[52:11] peace.
[52:13] And the power is in the name of Jesus.
[52:16] The power is in the name of Jesus. In
[52:19] the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow.
[52:23] Every tongue shall confess. At the name
[52:25] of Jesus, demons tremble. At the name of
[52:29] Jesus, every soul is delivered. At the
[52:33] name of Jesus, the Holy Ghost is given
[52:37] at the name of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[52:40] Hallelujah. God is moving
[52:44] the Holy Ghost.
[52:45] Hallelujah. And we know the Holy Ghost
[52:49] comes in the name of Jesus Christ. If
[52:52] you want the Holy Ghost, just call on
[52:55] the name of Jesus. Call him like you
[52:58] need him. Call him like you want him.
[53:00] Call him. Hallelujah. And he will surely
[53:03] answer. God said in his word, if any man
[53:07] come to me, I will in no wise cast him
[53:10] out. Don't worry about God refusing. He
[53:13] said he will never refuse you.
[53:17] Hallelujah.
[53:19] Come to me.
[53:21] Hallelujah.
[53:22] He is the only rest.
[53:25] Don't let the devil trick you this
[53:28] morning.
[53:31] That old demon
[53:36] will tell you you can never overcome.
[53:40] That is a lie.
[53:42] God gave us overcoming power
[53:46] over 2,000 years ago.
[53:49] Brother said, "God can't heal you
[53:52] cuz he's already healed you. God can't
[53:55] deliver you cuz he's already delivered
[53:58] you, but you got to accept your
[54:01] deliverance.
[54:03] You got to accept your healing.
[54:05] Hallelujah. You got to accept
[54:09] the power of the blood already done in
[54:12] your life.
[54:13] Hallelujah.
[54:14] There is not an addict.
[54:18] You cannot deliver.
[54:20] Hallelujah.
[54:21] Hallelujah.
[54:21] He said, Lord,
[54:23] I have problems in my sexual life.
[54:26] I deal here with a lust spirit.
[54:29] My God is here this morning to deliver
[54:33] you from that spirit.
[54:36] if you would allow him to do it.
[54:39] First of all, you must acknowledge
[54:42] that you need that help.
[54:44] And if you need that help,
[54:46] God will deliver you this morning. He
[54:49] has to command
[54:52] for a different woman. So, hallelujah.
[54:55] Is there anything too hard for God?
[54:58] You don't have to know even in your
[55:00] seat.
[55:01] Hallelujah. Is there anything too hard
[55:05] for God? Genesis
[55:18] to help you.
[55:20] But you got to hold the help.
[55:24] You got to acknowledge you need the
[55:25] help.
[55:28] And if you would do that, God will give
[55:30] you that help.
[55:32] Your help is already here.
[55:36] Hallelujah. Oh Lord, I thank you,
[55:39] Father.
[55:40] I thank you for your grace. I thank you
[55:43] for your mercy.
[55:45] I thank you for all that you do and
[55:48] everything that you're doing.

[57:56] really believe.
[58:00] Amen. We didn't get the key just right.
[58:04] But nevertheless, it's not the key. It's
[58:06] the word.

[58:10] in the blood.

[1:07:34] Let's give God a round of applause.
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:45] We thank God for our brother
[1:07:48] Timothy.
[1:07:54] And you know God is still God.
[1:08:00] The thing that I have heard for the
[1:08:02] veterans say
[1:08:05] that many people
[1:08:10] because they refuse to go all the way.
[1:08:16] That is a scary moment
[1:08:20] never want to experience
[1:08:24] and what people don't realize
[1:08:28] is that this message is all about
[1:08:30] character.
[1:08:34] Rebecca was chosen
[1:08:37] because of her parents.
[1:08:40] Ruth was chosen
[1:08:43] because of her character.
[1:08:46] The bride of Jesus Christ is chosen
[1:08:50] because of her character.
[1:08:53] He's given us the character
[1:08:55] or the means by obtaining the character.
[1:09:01] But you must make a choice.
[1:09:05] You've got to die out and rot to
[1:09:06] yourself.
[1:09:10] being said more than once here.
[1:09:14] People of God, this is not
[1:09:19] just a regular church service.
[1:09:23] You may have said to yourself
[1:09:30] with that kind of
[1:09:34] saying a lie to you.
[1:09:37] Amen.
[1:09:38] Because it's so deep,
[1:09:41] many of us didn't even understand what
[1:09:43] he said.
[1:09:46] I don't know what he did, but I I said
[1:09:48] it like that.
[1:09:50] I believe God spoke.
[1:09:53] And God doesn't waste his time, nor
[1:09:55] effort.
[1:09:58] Somebody need to be cleansed.
[1:10:01] Somebody needs the Holy Ghost
[1:10:04] in this church. Amen.
[1:10:07] Somebody needs repent.
[1:10:09] Somebody needs deliverance.
[1:10:12] That's what the Lord said.
[1:10:15] And he gave you the opportunity to do
[1:10:16] so.
[1:10:18] But many of you did just what he said.
[1:10:25] By God's grace, those of you who stood
[1:10:28] and sat there, you'll see
[1:10:31] your
[1:10:32] heart became your altar.
[1:10:35] I have nothing against that.
[1:10:38] But I'm going tell you something. It's a
[1:10:41] possibility
[1:10:43] that you may not get another call like
[1:10:45] you did today.
[1:10:48] And I thank God for
[1:10:50] the message
[1:10:53] because you were challenged by God and
[1:10:55] you didn't even know it.
[1:11:00] You saw a young man appear. thought that
[1:11:03] sermon is not so whatever
[1:11:09] you think
[1:11:12] it can be so simple
[1:11:14] it'll pass right through
[1:11:20] it takes a spiritual mind to
[1:11:23] hear the voice of God
[1:11:26] you know and I'll say it like this
[1:11:29] many of you would have never followed
[1:11:34] But John was always putting the axe to
[1:11:36] the root of the tree.
[1:11:38] John put the axe to the root of the
[1:11:39] tree.
[1:11:41] John asked. He put the axe
[1:11:46] in the root of the tree.
[1:11:49] He cut down trees
[1:11:51] off limbs.
[1:11:54] Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] Shouting, "Oh, hallelujah."
[1:12:00] But John preached so hard.
[1:12:04] They say he had a devil.
[1:12:07] Jesus Christ preached so hard.
[1:12:10] They said he was the answer.
[1:12:14] But every word that was spoken
[1:12:18] never went back for
[1:12:21] it accomplish his purpose.
[1:12:24] And so did the message this morning.
[1:12:25] Amen.
[1:12:28] I enjoyed it, brother.
[1:12:31] Amen.
[1:12:32] It was needed.
[1:12:35] We are at that right there.
[1:12:39] where we're we're getting ready to cross
[1:12:41] over
[1:12:43] and unless the changes be made in you
[1:12:49] by the Holy Ghost,
[1:12:51] you you won't make it.
[1:12:54] Your religion will be in vain.
[1:12:57] Your brother Brandon will be in vain.
[1:13:01] Many people feel like they can follow
[1:13:03] brother Brandon without change.
[1:13:07] This message brings a change.
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:10] That's how you know you follow him.
[1:13:14] Like somebody said, "Well, you don't
[1:13:15] love brother."
[1:13:18] If you love him,
[1:13:19] keep his commandments.
[1:13:21] Glory. Amen.
[1:13:23] Keep his word.
[1:13:24] Amen.
[1:13:26] You can't follow Elijah and not keep his
[1:13:28] word
[1:13:31] or the Holy Spirit. However you want,
[1:13:33] but it all works together.
[1:13:35] You love the Lord.
[1:13:37] I'm only saying these things because I
[1:13:39] love everybody in Jesus.
[1:13:43] Y'all heard what I said. I said I want
[1:13:44] to see you there. I'm going to be there.
[1:13:50] That's all I'm saying,
[1:13:52] you know, because this life is not even
[1:13:54] worth it.
[1:13:57] Look at all those little kids that got
[1:13:58] killed there out there.
[1:14:05] All it takes is a moment.
[1:14:10] And I trust that somehow if you did not
[1:14:13] excuse me did not have the courage
[1:14:17] to come to the altar, I trust
[1:14:20] in your heart
[1:14:25] because it's later than what most
[1:14:26] people.
[1:14:29] You love the Lord.
[1:14:31] Let's just thank the Lord on that. Do
[1:14:34] y'all did you appreciate our precious
[1:14:36] brother?
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:44] The like there's a lot of message
[1:14:46] preachers
[1:14:48] preach
[1:14:50] the great mystery
[1:14:53] but they never preach a message
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:56] that brings you to a sanctification.
[1:15:01] And you got to have it.
[1:15:04] Can't skip Luther.
[1:15:07] You can't skip.
[1:15:09] It was a restoration restoration tree,
[1:15:15] right? So you got to you got to
[1:15:17] understand
[1:15:19] you got to have a little bit of Luther,
[1:15:22] a little bit of western,
[1:15:24] a little bit of Pentecost
[1:15:27] in order to have Jesus himself.
[1:15:30] You can't step, you can't cross over the
