many of y'all know that he's mighty he's greater than natural he's almighty hallelujah we're just gonna go right to the scripture according to isaiah 54 and 17 isaiah 54 and 17 which is a familiar scripture all of us should be familiar with it but if you're not perhaps we'll you'll become familiar with it after tonight we love the lord appreciate all that he's doing for us in this time of pandemic and other things uh under that fifth and sixth seal political disturbances everywhere social disturbances you name it that's what we are experiencing uh isaiah 54 17 to give you a word of encouragement tonight i trust that it will um we we we thank god for who he is and perhaps tonight we gotta we'll realize what we're working with sometimes we think that when we work for god we're working with a little tool or something in our hands but it's greater than that god will never send someone who is not capable of coming back with the victory because he's a victorious god and if anybody gonna if he's gonna send anyone out there to do his bidding or to do his battle they will always come back victorious isaiah 54 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise up against thee and judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord understand you inherit this this is your heritage and their righteousness this the part i like is of me say the lord one more scripture saint john 1 saint john 1. saint john 1 beginning at the first verse we'll read the first second and third verse in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made let us pray our heavenly father we come before you lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for all that you do and has everything you've done for us lord the ending has not been seen as the scripture says that glory has not yet been revealed those things which you have prepared for us and i pray lord tonight that you would have thine own way bless each and every heart tonight those of us who are on the youtube i pray that god will have mercy and bless you we asked these things in your name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i know there was a few announcements made uh by god's grace and one of the announcements that i want to reiterate is the announcement uh dealing with the pastor and his son we'd like to invite those who are on the youtube um uh if you desire to give please do and we'll make sure that we give you a statement of of your receipts um by god's grace we will put the church's address down so if you would like to mail it to this particular place we would appreciate it and we have two weeks that we're working with in order to help our brother and their family and i want you to consider this because here it is a pastor y'all know how we work a pastor and his son died i learned today that his whole family his wife and all had coveted and two of them died which is the pastor and of course there's no one else in the church to run the church but the pastor he was the only one he leaves us a son and i believe another daughter but uh anyway we pray that you would uh god will touch your heart to give and we can assure you that every dime every penny that is given will be uh sent to them we appreciate that i don't normally do that i just feel moved because i'm a pastor and i know if something would happen to me and i don't know how that would be but i trust that god would open somebody else's heart to help us we're living in that day where we need to pull together and help each other anyhow you love the lord all right we're going to be coming from the scripture isaiah 54 and we know by god's grace uh we're talking about war the thing is i think oftentimes we don't know what a real war is some of us have had little battles and fights in our minds but most of us have never been into like a real war of physical fighting where there's real killing and and dismemberment and things of that nature like world war one and world war ii and even those who came back from vietnam war many of them are psychologically disturbed because of the things that they saw and the things that they had witnessed it is something that will affect you uh for a long time except god have mercy when we talk about war we're talking about a conflict that's carried on by force of arms as between nations or between parties or within a nation uh warfare and it sounds like the united states when i read this description because there are warfares between things people are fighting and uh forces are or has armed themselves one against the other just a ball of confusion you asked me but we know that none of this existed in the beginning we know that the first battle ever that did take place uh was during the time of lucifer and lucifer wanted a greater kingdom than micah and lucifer means angel of light and michael means who is like god and there was a great battle going on because even lucifer is still doing the same thing uh now that he did in the beginning because the bible said he will disguise himself as an angel of light meaning that he'll come in the form of god meaning that he will deceive many by way by his way of lies and influence and if you understand uh uh what we're talking about you must understand that there is one tactic of the devil and that tactic will never change he he his tactic is that he calls his men to reason he he made adam and eve fall by way of reasoning and that would always be his way because there's nothing greater than the word that's right nothing greater and he can't go beyond that he can't go higher than that but one thing that lucifer does and can do is that he can pervert it by way of his reasoning i want to note something to you tonight faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god and as he was the word in the beginning was the word that logos that went out of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he was the word of god manifested on the earth my sub topic amen was the person of the word because i think that sometimes people think that this is all god well it is in letter form but the bible declares that he is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and we know what his spirit is the spirit is the holy ghost the holy spirit and his truth is the word amen amen so we know that there is no weapon formed against those who are elected and chosen by god is that right but we need to know really who he is and the bible said he is the word but let's back it up a little bit because before he was the word amen he was what we call the logos the spirit of the word but before he was the logos he was elohim and understand he never changes his nature that's why the bible calls jesus christ the only potentate he really is the only power and everything else are you know of is faking it y'all understand me because even when jesus was raised from the dead the bible said all power in heaven and in earth was given unto him now to bring us to a place where we know what we've got on our side better yet say who we have on our side the bible says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now understand what i'm talking about this this elohim amen condescended into what we call the logos right because remember elohim means self-existing one he had no beginning of days nor ending he was just god it is a mystery that we cannot wrap our minds around because we're finite and he's infinite hallelujah he feels all space and time hallelujah amen he's creator of all space and time hallelujah amen so you and i must understand amen that he is amen the almighty god now even in the book of revelation it describes him after he had conquered death hell in the grave and the resurrection had taken place and now he's getting ready to set upon his throne we're going to crown him amen and in revelation 4 and 11 it says thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things for thy pleasure they are and were created what are you talking about i'm saying everything that has been created god created it and it it's it was all for his pleasure god is a god of contrast amen he can't show that he's almighty until he's uh until you see something that is not mighty hallelujah he can't show that he's a healer until somebody is sick so you understand he created all of these things because there were attributes on the inside of him that he wanted to display but the part that i'm getting to is that he was a father and the only way you can be a father is that you have to have a family hallelujah and the only way that he could have a family is that he had to give birth to it he had to bring it forth hallelujah yes sir one way or the other is that right and so we see that satan like i said satan tactics is in this warfare is reasoning right and we know our enemy coming from the message putting on the whole arm of god he said maybe you didn't get it right the way i said it we know our enemy he says when anyone any spirit any person tries to disagree with god's word remember that's your enemy that's your enemy we know his old tactics that's the one he broke the human race down and that's the way he breaks them down yet today and that's the way he gets you away from god is to disbelieve his word and the only way that you can ever stay in fellowship with god and talk to him in the cool of the evening is stay fortified in the word on both sides right let the curtain of god word drop all around you and you'll be uh dropped right in the middle of it he said then you are fortified in other words amen we know that in a natural army when men before they go to battle they must train you know even in my mind we talk about training but but in reality when it comes to training god only trains us like a tutor or a child amen until we're formed into his complete image but when we come into the complete image of god there is no more training right because you got to understand by god's grace something takes place when it comes when you come to your maturity it's like the adoption it's no longer praying to god in that sense because god has given you the authority to speak the word so much say so much so he said whatsoever you say amen right he said if you say to this mountain be thou move that mountain must move now i'm going to tell you and show you what that's all about in just a moment because this is not about human flesh it's not mind over matter it's something greater than that we see it it's in the word but we must believe it not with the mind but with the heart see we know i i've been military and and i've had to go through basic training and we know how difficult it can be and you know the the the sergeant don't care how tired you get matter of fact if you complain about being tired he might tell you to do 50 push-ups and normally when you get in trouble the whole crew gets in trouble so it is a thing that you learn that if i mess up in such a way everybody has to pay for it that's just like the body of christ right when a can messed up the whole camp had to pay for it right now he doesn't go before us as the prophet of god says in this last battle jesus christ does not go before us he goes in us why because ye are the housing if i could say like that the temple of god and the bible said christ in you you christ in you is the hope of glory this is why the scripture tells us to girdle up the loins of our mind that is that right not the mind here but the mind of the heart because it's in the heart man thinketh hallelujah you love the lord we're preparing for battle but how are we going to prepare brother brooks we've got an enemy coming at us there and there's no way we could defeat this enemy in the flesh is that right you say what are you saying remember peter had been with jesus for three years and a half and when jesus told peter you're going to deny me thrice before the crow peter says no sir i'll never do it but we know for a fact that before the throat crowed thrice and then peter denied jesus even swore about it hallelujah he was lacking something even though he was a believer he was a lacking courage hallelujah is that right he was afraid of the pressure the pressure got to him hallelujah when that lady says aren't you one of them he says no i'm not what was it he was but he did not have the power of courage y'all hear me now he denied christ amen amen but it was his spirit but he needed a change to take place see you can be justified you can be sanctified you can be anointed with the holy ghost we're not talking about anointing we're talking about filled with the holy ghost that makes the difference anybody can be anointed is that right i believe it was herod that prophesied that one should die for the other hallelujah see but we must understand that we're preparing there's a pro there's a there's something coming amen and understand this even even uh jacob knew he couldn't fight the battle that was coming jacob had the blessing the promise but there was still something lacking in jacob and that was a nature change hallelujah he saw he saw coming he knew he saw it was coming and the fear that that enveloped him made him do stupid stuff he sent his family he sent his wives he sent his children amen to meet the enemy hallelujah amen glory to god but he didn't have what it that hour was requiring or calling for but one thing he knew he knew he didn't have the goods hallelujah it is not enough to have the promise of this message it's not even enough amen to to have that blessing spoken over you which the preachers always do you got to know him for yourself hallelujah and jacob knew better he wrestled with the angel maybe it was an all-night prayer but he wouldn't let him go he said lord i'm not gonna let you go until you bless me i'm getting ready to fight esau and i know i need your authority and power backing me amen hallelujah the great and mighty conqueror 1957. he said then he came he came down because talking about god he was in the beginning i'm trying to give you something tonight and i hope you catch it i don't know the bible says it's not something deep it's just something simple that has always been with us he was the word he was the logos that went out of god and the logos in the beginning was the word and he became the word and then when he ascended up on that glorious day of easter he become not only the word but he become the high priest of his own word hello how can you lose if he's a high priest amen of his own word hallelujah oh what a glorious thing just think he's not only the word but he is the high priest of his own word how could he doubt it how could we talk to walk to him and not believe that we receive what he asked for he is the word and the intercessor of the word let me say it like this he's the high priest of his word how can he doubt his word he cannot hallelujah and that high priest will make sure that the word is made manifest hallelujah yes and that same flesh that was in the word received up into glory and now is a high priest making intercessions by himself to his word this is why we pray to jesus christ this is why we don't pray to buddha our lives something like father son and holy ghost only it is in by the name of jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess at the name of jesus demons tremble this is who we pray to amen there is no other name that salvation can come through that's what it takes that's the matter that the church has got material excuse me that the church is god think about it what weapon what weapon i asked the question again what weapon formed against you can prosper there's never been one like it it was the word and when he comes he has bought he was born in a manger he come to see the weapon of love amen to conquer the world not with army bullets not with machine guns and tanks but he come into a different manner he come in the form of love he was god's love so you understand me if the alpha has become the omega amen the only way to conquer the devil in this hour is love not yours his love that's the only way that is why we've got such confusion going on fights in the battles and the family battles in the kingdom battles on the job battles everywhere amen and god says love them you must love you must learn to love your enemy you conquer by love amen is that right and the word god understand what i'm saying we've got to stop thinking that the word is separate from god amen the word is god if you can really see it you understand when you speak that word amen that's god you're bringing on the scene once it comes out it cannot come back void as long as that word is mixed with faith amen hallelujah and the word will defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any condition jesus proved it when he defeated satan not using his power but just on the word of the father it is written and he defeated him hallelujah you don't need no feelings you don't need no emotions the word is god speak the word and the word will defeat your enemy we don't have to be like the pentecostals oh i felt goosebumps oh i shouted or i speak with tongues none of that is needful when you speak in the word y'all understand me i didn't say do away with it i said but when the word is being spoken because you can manifest all those kinds of things and yet not have faith in what you just spoke you have to have faith in this thing hallelujah it is the only thing that pleases god i feel like shouting right now right psalm 61 beginning at the first verse amen hear my cry oh god attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i you know when i was in denominations i used to envision this big old rock that ain't what he's talking about lead me to that revelation that is higher than i is that right he told peter he said when peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god he said upon this rock i'll build my church what was he working with the revelation of who jesus is see he that coming to god must first believe that he is god and that he's a rewarder of them that diligence he came you got to believe he's god and you got to believe that this word is the absolute hallelujah from the end of the rap listen when the devil know you believe he leaves when he sees that you're not moving off that word the devil leaves why because there's a word if you resist the devil he'll flee from you and how do you resist him by speaking that word standing on that word even it's a matter of life and death that's what you must do hallelujah for how for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from my enemy hallelujah when i need somewhere to hide i run to the rock hallelujah in times of tribulation i go to the rock hallelujah when there's no food on the table i go to the rock what is that rock my revelation and who is my revelation jesus christ is god hallelujah proverbs 18 10 says the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is what safe hallelujah no weapon formed against you can prosper what are you talking about brother brooks you'll see it's not long uh the future holds it y'all understand me amen because you watch this confusion turn toward the christian and you better know you got your goods you might think i'm crazy preaching like this but it's the truth anyhow amen you got to realize amen that anytime communism moved into a country the first they persecuted was the christians we don't have to worry about that though but i'm just saying listen in this army you can't practice it's not opening up a witchcraft book or something and you got a wand and trying to practice the voodoo you don't practice this not the power of god you cannot hallelujah it can't be given to you as the practice remember simeon said simon said uh to peter them can i buy this you can't even buy it hallelujah the only way that just this works for you you must be born into it hallelujah listen and even having faith doesn't make it all together just right because many people have faith to do exploits yet they don't know god nor do they love god because they come in the last day and they said father have not we done many miracles in your name and jesus says depart from me you worker of iniquity i don't even know you see there must come a union between you and divine love hallelujah and this is uniting signs in time everything is uniting so it is our evidence that god is uniting himself with his bride no practicing no mind over matter this is a kingdom with the king is that right and who is our king maybe the world don't know it yet but the bible tells us who our king is hallelujah he's the same king he always have been hallelujah he's the king of glory the king of honor the king of splendor he's the king of everything and everyone and everybody hallelujah when jesus was on the earth saint john 18 beginning at the 36th verse he was asked a question several questions uh by pilate and jesus answered pilate my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of the world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from his in other words it's coming but now it's not from hence amen pilate therefore said unto him art thou art king then and jesus answered thou saith that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i unto the world that i should bear witness unto the what truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice now he's made us king and priests hallelujah you can't be a king without a kingdom amen hallelujah and if he made us priests that means that he has given us a life amen that can handle the blood and the bride of jesus christ is the blood of jesus christ by the spirit hallelujah oh what are you saying brother books amen i don't have a second person in me i don't have a third person in me i've got the person that's where i'm going now let me ask you a question before i go any further if the almighty god who created heaven and earth lives in you then what does it make you i'll tell you what it makes you it makes you what he is and he's omnipotent all powerful god see we forget because sometimes we want to feel it amen my heart beats every day but i'm not listening to it and neither do i feel it but it beats and as long as it's beating i know it's alive hallelujah the moment it stopped beating it's the moment i stopped living that's the way it is and god is eternal he never stopped beating if you understand what i mean because he said if any man believe in me though he was dead yet shelley lives hebrews 12th chapter beginning at the first verse we're foreseeing we are also encompassed about with a greater cloud of witnesses we got some folks on our side let us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily set us and let us run with patience the race that is set before what you know what he's saying let us lay aside all the reasoning all the stuff that satan has put in our minds to make us reason let us lay all of that along because understand when you reason that's when you fall into sin looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith did he do it he began it and he ended it hallelujah there was no man worthy to take the book he was the only one worthy hallelujah and he took the book yes hallelujah when he was on calvary he said it's finished hallelujah ah is that all right we know if had he not finished it we all would have been lost but because he finished it my brother is he your brother my brother finished it your brother finished it and if he's my brother i'm in the family of god hallelujah and if i'm in the family of god god doesn't produce amen clay children amen hallelujah you love the lord you know what he produces quickening spirits powerful spirits excuse me nose itching forgive me that's not corona but the thing i want you to understand by god's grace amen he is a spirit and you must become spirit amen y'all hear what i'm saying you must die to your flesh that you might be born again the first adam gave us this house but the second adam gives us a house of a word we call it a theophany body looking unto jesus the authentic finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him amen endure the cross despises shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god you must be equipped for the battle is that right hey you got to have your equipment you don't go into a battle amen not nowadays with a slingshot david did hallelujah samson had a jawbone of an ass but god gives us a greater weapon and that weapon is his word hallelujah if you can believe the slingshot a man killed the giant you know what the difference was david was anointed it wasn't just his effort to kill the giant but he had faith and when he had faith that anointing who was god and then aimed at rock and it hit the giant in the head so is it with with with the samson with the jawbone of an ass it wasn't the jawbone that killed the the philistines it was god's anointed jawbone yeah hallelujah it could not break it could not diminish it was stronger than all the armor of the philistines y'all hear what i'm saying why because it was anointed y'all understand me though you be human flesh when you are anointed you become invincible all power in heaven and earth is given unto you hallelujah nothing what are you talking about brother brooks remember hallelujah when they tried they meant to kill john and they put john on the outer baptism they boil a big old bottle of oil hallelujah they're going to kill him hallelujah but john be anointed by god he had a mission and that was the to write the book of revelation hallelujah nothing could kill john you understand me if that's too too too too uh uh too much for you let's go down to to the fiery furnace they believe god they walked into the furnace and was not even destroyed the bible said not even the fire were sins their clothes and there was no smell of it even there why there was an anointed what anointing it wasn't a second person it was god himself you don't believe that the bible says amen when they looked amen into the fiery furnace they saw one that looked like the son of god hallelujah what was it it wasn't that he he went before them but this time is different in the time of israel he was above them hallelujah yes sir he was with him in the old testament but this test this part he's not just with us above us or before us he's in us you are the housing of god that's why the devil don't want you to get the holy ghost that's why he don't want you to be sealed because once you sealed you are an invincible army you can never be defeated from that point on hallelujah you must be equipped hallelujah no listen no nation sends anyone to battle unequipped y'all know how it is in the united states you've got to go and you've got to go to you know uh train and you know all of those things and you know but that ain't the way god does it hallelujah oh sham god had no training he had no training and some god is the type of the bride hallelujah all she sam god knew is that he had a promise and he took that thing that was setting before him the ox goat and he whooped those devils out he was tired tired of the devil coming in and stealing all of his food and everything else and leaving his family destitute hallelujah somehow we got to get tired of the devil whipping on us right taken away every time you think you got a little money he puts a hole in your pocket you ought to be a tired of that hallelujah fight the devil by the word the bible says to the to the believer god's will is that you prosper even as your soul prosper so you want to see yourself naturally prospering hallelujah let your soul prosper hallelujah your brother adam said it like this be equipped be ready because you wrestle not against flesh and blood but against satan god's enemy principalities and wickedness and evil spirits wickedness in high places and we're pressing toward the mark of the high calling and we're certainly in a battle now you hear what i'm saying at the same time that god is making us into that perfect man we are in an intense battle with the devil with principalities and wickedness and everything else oh and no nation amen would dare to sin a man on a battlefield untrained he might not only get himself killed but another group he doesn't know how to take a hold and so he must be prepared for it and the nations are wise to that they get their men ready hey what do you mean every nation has spies american got spies chinese china got spies iraq and every nation under heaven got spies and everybody got spies in each other's country why because they want to check out your weaponry they want to make sure that if they go to battle with you their weaponry will be better than yours it is a real it's a real deal that's why everybody is all in in in turmoil right now because somewhere they don't know who's got the most powerful weapon and so everybody's afraid to use what they got because they don't want to destroy the world hallelujah but god got spies too you call that angels the bible said amen the angels of the lord is in camp about those amen that fear him hallelujah listen not just angels the bible said these angels are a wall of fire amen oh glory to god is that all right so you and i understand him and we're preparing but the devil don't understand amen nothing can stop the word of god if god is ordained you to be bright nothing can stop you no matter what he puts before you amen you might not be where you want to be when you're getting there god's gonna make sure you're there hallelujah the dog cannot shut until you inside hallelujah glory to god and you know why listen we're putting on the whole armor you know many times i thought well i gotta have that helmet of faith and this and that and i'm not even understanding you know spiritually what he's talking about so you can understand the bible says put on christ in simplicity put on christ put on the whole arm of god put on christ you know why it's because the whole world is controlled by satan every kingdom in the world is ruled by satan we hate to think that but that's the scripture you know the enemy's taking our lord up into a high exceedingly mounting a sling high and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and said they are all mine i'm the rule of them i do with them whatever i want to and i'll give them to you now the devil couldn't offer god jesus christ something he didn't have but because of the fall adam forfeited his inheritance and now it be this is satan's eating you know and we wonder why everybody is so evil and doing so many evil things these are his children amen they're going to do whatever he wants them to do but i want him to know that the children of god is going to do everything god wants us to do amen watch the wisdom of the lord jesus staying with the word of god hallelujah he knew he'd fall air to them in the kingdom and in the kingdom that is to come in the millennium so he said get behind satan let me ask you a question should we come to a time when they say except you bow should we come to a time when they begin to take your house or take your car or take your bank account or take things away from you amen what you going to do cause let me tell you something naked you came into the world and nick is you're going to leave the only thing that you're going to take is your character and don't even dare think amen that god's picking on me and i'm the only one that's going through this list let's go back hallelujah let's go back to the dark ages let's go back when martyrdom was a common thing hallelujah let's go back people of god really i mean if you think about it we've got it easy yes sir yes sir now you see satan can do with them whatever he wishes to these nations were controlled by god we'd have no law he said if this nation was controlled by god we wouldn't have no war there would be no more conflict see but satan is the rule of every kingdom he rules the world but someday you see in this in the people every person is wanting one nation to control the world want one flag and they want to be the most powerful nation in the world is that true that's the truth and take everything under their control and make all the rest of the nation speak their language what is it it only shows that there is a such a place in other words there's a real to this negative there's a positive to this negative hallelujah there is a place where everybody speaks the same language there is a place where there's peace and no war no conflict there is a place but in this kingdom jesus christ is lord ephesians 6 10 through 17 finally my brother be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole arm of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principality against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high place wherefore taken you the whole arm of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day what evil day this day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and have it on the breastplate of righteousness now you've got to understand this how can i say it paul was looking at something a pressure something coming why would he say when you stand stand there for having your lawrence girl about with truth when you've done all to stand stand there's coming a time you're gonna have to stand right yeah you know what church is out during this time church is out there is no more music no more singers you understand me you're by yourself you and god and he says listen when you've done this cause you gotta understand a house divided that cannot stand so let me say it like this if you don't know that this house is divided something's wrong with you and if it is divided it is just on the edge of the fall y'all understand what i'm saying and that's in every nation every nation is fighting each other the houses are divided and who did it but god himself hallelujah because what is he doing while they falling apart there is a uniting time for the pride of jesus christ hallelujah we're becoming one by the baptism of the holy ghost saying your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace huh you're bringing peace in the time of war above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked he didn't say psalm he said oh your shield of faith what is that christ in you that's your shield he cannot deny his word that's the logos in the holy spirit however you want to put it he cannot that is your shield that is your buckler that's your buffet however you want to put it hallelujah and take the helmet of helmet of salvation in the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints hallelujah we're in the under the anointing of joshua y'all believe that because moses has died moses is dead now the holy spirit is joshua is that right listen when the bible said the bible uh just a quote to take on the whole album he said when god gave israel when he was in egypt but they had to fight for every inch of it and he told joshua he said wherever the soul of your foot treads upon that i have given you so footprints mean possession see just keep walking walking pressing on and every time you make a step into the kingdom of god that's yours all things are possible that's given hallelujah and all things are given that's possible ah but it is a battle it doesn't come easy it is a battle but the bible said the battle is not yours saith the lord i'm a soldier of the cross is that all right just give me a few more minutes by god's grace hallelujah just taking on that whole armor which is christ listen just coming up the ladder of the statue of christ it's not gonna you gotta have the full thing and you got to understand that you know a lot of times people are just waiting to be sealed or capped off and god is saying but this can happen now this could be your day i know that god is going to do some great things when that squeeze come on he's coming on the scene yes sir y'all understand me but when he comes on the scene he's not going to be standing in front of you he's going to be standing in you it's about christ and lucifer and it will always be that until time is ended amen so then the first battle that was ever fought was not fought on the earth it was fault in heaven i'm saying that again and michael and his angels against lucifer and they were kicked out of heaven and then the great army of the devil and all the imps fell upon the earth and god know there was going to be a battle let me say this this is these are my words now if this be true then who are you fighting just as we did in the beginning church members fallen angels those who once worshiped god but by lucifer's reasoning amen he reasoned god right out of their minds well how do you know because the bible said god gave them over to a reprobate mind those who did not want to contain god in their knowledge that's the way the angels were in the beginning that's the way they are today look at our political system you say what do you mean those same people that was in power then is in power now hallelujah that's why they hate you because amen you stand for truth you stand for righteousness and you won't allow nothing no one amen to make you reason the word of god away hallelujah what you gonna do when the devil pulled up your record off of the internet and says i got you now look at this what you gonna say all you can say is that yes your record i i did that but there's another record that counts and that's god's record and the blood has washed me clean and i stand before you a perfect man they're gonna say he's crazy he's crazy y'all hear what i'm saying what i'm trying to tell you is that we you you we all made mistakes but let me tell you at the end of the day you better know who you are and know the power of the blood better know the power of the blood cause the devil coming at you i was i read something the other day and i i i i hope not to say something bad but i was told that there be i had some some things on martin luther king threatened him with that he didn't pay no attention to him y'all understand me people follow you you what are you talking about your phone your car wherever this watch when you go to the store you put your credit card in they got all your information it's a system and the system got you paid but one thing they don't know is that you've been born again they don't understand you're not on this earth the only man who had a perfect record was jesus himself hallelujah the bible according to revelation 5 said there was no man worthy so if that be the truth i could never be worthy but he makes me worthy hallelujah y'all love the lord amen listen he goes on to say and when the devil got a record then you know uh uh we know we're fighting against and god knows there was going to be a battle i believe he knows from the very beginning everything that we would ever be if god is infinite he knows every flea that would be on the earth every night how many times he would bat his eye and how much taller they all make together he's infinite so the infinite gods going to choose for his army the best weapon that could be given and he cho he chose it and it was his word god gave his army the best equipment that could ever you they could ever use and you ever could use and it would never have to be changed and he never changed the sense you don't have to prove it it remains the same all the time it's god's word that he fortified his people with y'all understand what i'm going with amen and we keep saying well i've got to learn all of this get him amen hallelujah i may not know all of the book but i definitely know the author y'all understand me hallelujah no matter how many things satan ever gets how many things any good army ever gets or anything can never take the place of god's first choice his word he gave them his word his promise and he said stay with it and the best that could be done right now the enemy knows as long as the human race listen stays with the word he'll never be able to touch him amen now i'm beginning to feel religious right now he said as long as the human race stays with the word god fortifies his family on the earth his army in the fort of his word that is our fortress the name of the lord is a strong is a mighty tower the righteous run in it and are safe they're fortified the lord is the word they are in there fortified and safe forever more as long as the human race stays in the word as long as the church stays in the word it's fortified there's nothing going to bother it now i could go on but there's a few more things i want to read by god's grace and i i said that that came up to that but i want to say this by god's grace because some of us might be concerned in the same message i was thinking about the lord when he gave me this message because he told me what to go listen to and this is what i found he says while we're thinking about communism let me give you a little word this is going to sound strange for a preacher but don't you never fear anything about communism it ain't nothing i want any minister or any scripture leader to ever show me in the bible where communism ruled the world we ain't got to worry about china china will never rule the world y'all hear what i'm saying amen but let me move on he said i want any minister right he said communism will in other words you'll never rule the world romanism is going to rule the world according to the bible he said you watch that don't you think about communism it's just a puppet in the hand of god to fulfill his will now i want you to understand because when these great companies got with the pope things changed and that's what that was being used by god to do what bring america to her knees you that's what's going to happen and i don't know how how long i'm going to stay safe but i ain't scared i want you to understand i understand who i am if i don't know nothing else i do know who i am amen it's just a puppet in the hands of god to fulfill his will exactly what he said he uses that but don't you never worry about communism it's romanism the bible says there are three curtains as i leave you this afternoon i leave this with you remember there's three curtains one of them is called the iron curtain y'all know who that is one of them is the bamboo curtain that was china so forth eastern and then there's a purple curtain don't fear the bamboo curtain why is the prophet of god saying that in this time he see what was coming up hallelujah he said but better be careful right he said but be careful of the purple one and miss purple stood up there she stood up there to let you know she's in control whoo i ain't talking about no woman i'm talking about the church hallelujah oh the antichrist shall be so close to deceive the very elected if it was possible you know why it's not possible because god sent us a prophet amen hallelujah and without a vision the people perish hallelujah you love the lord oh i'm just going to stop here there's other things that i have but i'll just leave it there well it's just one more quote you don't mind he was good with his sword talking about peter peter was good with his sword he he cut that fella y'all that's right he could do the creed just as good as anybody could but he when it comes to spiritual courage he didn't have it there i go again coming right back down to it so he fell right there now why he only knowed one thing his creed but brother after he went up to pentecost he put on the whole arm of god what was that the holy ghost is what the whole arm of god now watch him he's a different person now he puts on the whole armor what was it the word that he walked with was in him amen that's the whole armor burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul he had the whole arm of god on that's god provided army armor he had the baptism filled with the holy ghost what is it god makes himself ever present in his own army god on that day of pentecost sent down the full arm of god for his army that was himself among you yes a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me because i will be with you even in you until the end of the world jesus christ the same yesterday and forever matthew 28 all right that he was he is with us in us that's the armor it's him he is the word and he is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is in us which is the word making the promise manifest true this is the promise this is the promise christ is the word and he makes it manifest the spirit quickens the word right makes the see in other words he's the powder that sends the bullet out there with it like it was the powder when david met goliath with the slingshot with a rock in it he only had one place to hit and that was right between the eyes the rest of it was armored hallelujah god but god in that spirit what was it he had five stones and slingshot look faith in jesus f-a-i-t-h j-e-s-u-s here he comes something fixing to happen because there's the word the promise and the power to sling it that's what we need today is a man that'll take god's word with the power of the holy ghost behind him to press it out there and watch it come to pass that's god's army amen his word of fire his army is all dressed with the ever presence of himself in there going with us hallelujah going with us i'll go with you be in you see not that speaking the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the word huh in his army he he he presents his army did y'all understand that going with you in you that's how he goes with you in you right he presents his army in the form of his five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists huh you mean those things still work oh that's it reasoning what you're going to reason the word away say we don't need this anymore hallelujah he said that's your enemy that's his army that's his soldier and that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on the grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of god amen each one backing one another with him the chief captain not out there in front up here above back behind but in them that's the army
