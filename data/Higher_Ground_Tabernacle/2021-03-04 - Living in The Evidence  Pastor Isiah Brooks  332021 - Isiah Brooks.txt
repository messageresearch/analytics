========================================
[Music] i shall not be burnt on the rock of ages i shall not be moved [Music] oh [Music] shall amen be i shall not be moved i shall not be i shall not be moved [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen let's sing him in this song amen [Music] amen hallelujah not by might it's not by power but by my spirit said the lord amen i'm so glad about that hallelujah it's not by my it's not my power but by my spirit save the lord it's not by my it's not by power but by my spirit say the lord [Music] by my spirit [Music] but by my spirit [Music] shall we [Music] oh amen is our brother comes amen to lord do you remember me amen [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] outside the sun [Music] you oh [Music] [Applause] as much [Music] yes me [Music] i don't mind him forgetting my sins but i don't want him to forget me and i thank the lord for that because he said he would never forget us he would never leave us nor will he forsake us so we thank god for those of you who have come out to the house of the lord who appreciate the lord jesus and all the songs that have gone up before the lord we're not prolonging the time we're going to ask that you turn with us to philippians 2 5 and 6 philippians 2. we preached this message when we were in michigan and we're going to work it this night um some added things and i trust the lord will bless you in his word tonight philippians 2 we're gonna read the fifth and sixth verse and then we'll go to revelations 10 1. philippians 2 5 and 6. let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god revelations 10 which is a familiar scripture we started the first verse and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lift up his hands his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things that which are are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets let us pray dear lord we thank you tonight we appreciate everyone that have come out to the house of the lord tonight lord we realize oh god those who did come came in a way of a sacrificial offering a willing offering though and we thank you for those who have come we pray that you bless them in a special way for those who could not make it here tonight for various reasons we pray that you bless them as well and those are men who are who are listening perhaps on the uh youtube that they will be blessed as well we ask these things in jesus christ's name we pray amen so we thank god for his grace and his mercy and i'm going to try to take my time and speak as clearly as i possibly can so that that those who are listening to the interpreter can understand what i'm saying but i want to entitle this message living in the evidence living in the evidence you know brother branham talks about a witness if you're going to be a witness he said it can't be something that has been told you it can't be a hearsay to be a witness you have you must be there to see it and with your own eyes to be a real testimony that the uh event did happen now we weren't there in our natural 2000 years ago but one thing jesus said that one day you'll be a witness of me and you must understand that if that be the case uh god is expecting us to have an experience that will become evidence that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever when we think about god and how the lord came and what he did for us it really uh encourages our soul it does more than that i'm so grateful that god has given us the grace to live in this hour because out of all of the ages we have the opportunity to see god in his fullness amen not in a partial way but we have come to see god in his fullness when god sent uh saint luke 17 30 and when the son of man was being revealed in our day the world at large large had no idea what they were looking at uh some looked at him as a little kentuckian and some uh look at him with envy and hatred there were those who were jealous and all this was a was a man who had been chosen by god to do a special work in these last days uh william branham was he uh anointed with the spirit of elijah uh he was a prophet of the age and he came to declare that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he did not come to build a kingdom for himself hallelujah like we have you know in in our day different people following different men but we're like the scripture describes as paul said follow me as i follow christ we as i said is living in such a great time the bible tells us that we are supposed to let the mind that was in christ be in us and every time i think about that it just illuminates me it excites me because i believe that i have a promise that will come to pass and god when he promised us things there is nothing that makes him do what he does except his promise he is the god a man that cannot be flattered he can't be manipulated he can't be bought amen and the reason why god do what he does is because he makes his promise and when he makes a promise the bible says that his promises are yay amen every promise god has made god is obligated and will do amen make those promises come to pass there was a time that god was working in men and i want to read a quote in just a moment but he was working in men just like you and i god has always veiled himself in the beginning he was the pillar of fire in moses day he was the burning bush is that right in in abraham's day he was the three men walking up in the cool of the evening is that right amen god has always availed himself but there are those whom god reveals himself to and um these ones who god reveals himself is likened unto sons and daughters of god for example amen you had cain and abel amen they were required amen to bring forth a sacrifice unto the lord but they didn't have any literature and they didn't have any books they didn't have a a computer or in the internet uh the revelation the the understanding of what god wanted them to do had to come by revelation and we realize amen that abel amen received god's revelation in other words he received the very thought of god's mind to understand what he was to do or what was necessary for him to do and we find out but cain amen did not receive the revelation he you know and you got to understand now he understood by intellect but he didn't understand by revelation because god told cain that if he would go and do the exact what abel had done that his sacrifice would be accepted but being who he was a son of a serpent amen he was stubborn and refused to bow down to the word of god hallelujah you see we're here in today we're here to worship god and in order to worship god you worship him in spirit and truth understand what truth is truth is the word he said because my word is truth amen but you must have amen by god's grace that holy spirit because the holy spirit is the author of the word hallelujah he is the alpha he's the omega he's the beginning he's the ending amen he is the shepherd of our soul i heard something today and this man was preaching as a friend of mine and i don't normally listen to others but he said something that really struck my attention and in this he was talking about polycop and how polycock was a true servant of the lord and most of us need we know who apolo cop was and you know he was one that was hated amen among those pretend christians and of course roman itself you know we know how polly cop died they set him afire and uh they tried to set him afire and things wouldn't work and so they literally pierced him in the in the side and all of his blood ran out and and drowned the fire but one of the things that he said uh uh because the voice of god says fear not polycop i'm with thee now i don't know about you but if i have been fearing just a little bit and just to hear the voice of god speak to me amen that voice would automatically cast out the fear that i was experiencing and so what polycop said to himself was play the man now i don't know what my friend was talking about what all he saw when he stated that but i thought to myself the scripture let this mind be in you for example you know many of us don't remember the old stereos we used to have we call them records and they were made out of hard plastic or something but anyway we had uh and you had a little needle on there and it'll drop down on the record player and it began to play and it began to play and that's how we got out sound maybe i'm really old and y'all don't know what i'm talking about maybe that was in the ancient of days but in my day amen we spent lots of money on those kind of things like people are now spending on cell phones and all that kind of stuff but anyhow sometimes that record would get scratched and when it would get scratched it would play the same thing over yeah or skip yeah it would play the same and then you have to hit it for it to skip sometime because you wanted it to move on amen and so when i thought about play the man i thought okay this what i believe god wants us to see you see because we had an example in our day we call him elijah he had the spirit of elijah on him his name was william branham and i believe that if we would could play him because you got to understand the power that was behind him it was not his power it was the holy ghost power and the things in which he did we're able to do it let's supposing we playing a tape and he says you can do it and it gets stuck there you know what's going to say you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do and and and after a while when you hear that you can do it over and over again all of a sudden you say i can do it i can do it i can do it and that's what playing the messages is all about is because when you play the message you're playing the man not the man william branham but the man christ jesus hallelujah and those tapes amen and those books that we're constantly reading over and over sometimes you get stuck on one take for about a week or so amen because it gets so wonderfully good amen you just don't want to let nothing slip through the cracks amen so anyway i'm gonna say a few things on that because i believe that these characters and i heard brother branham say it these characters in the bible was put there for us they're there for us so that we can understand their behaviors in times of crisis hallelujah and if we could catch a hold of their uh life style of what they would do under certain circumstances and play that then you'll realize that what they did you can do also because what they did was impart but now we have the whole hallelujah think about it in the new testament it talks about a greek woman a phoenician woman and the prophet of god has a quote and i'm going to read that to you he talks about it amen and in the message perseverance and i think right now this is a time where god is asking us to persevere you know when you persevere you got literally you got a pressure you got obstacles you got things that will hinder you from moving forward if you didn't put a press to it you know she she you know she pressed through the crowd you see so but anyway he says this little greek woman no doubt had heard i like this of him heard of jesus the great revival a young prophet coming up in galilee from nazareth and was showing great signs and wonders she had heard of him and faith comes by hearing this seraphine woman being a greek hallelujah faith finds sources that others don't see amen hallelujah now you think that god would have used a jew at that time but he took a gentile a greek and he found faith in her heart many times people don't even know they have faith because they're resting upon feelings where feelings and faith lives in two different worlds they are basically of two different dimensions hallelujah faith is something that you cannot explain but you know you got it and see no matter what the devil tells you the devil says you won't make the rapture but the faith is a strong man say you are a liar because i have already made the rapture amen you see and i'm gonna just pause here for just a moment you know when uh uh elijah there was a a mount karma showdown and it was between the bell worshipers and ahab and elijah and remember amen when they were up on top of the mountain amen we we understood that elijah said uh it wasn't going to rain until i called for it but during this mount calmer showdown amen we we know that elijah told his servant go check and see if you see a cloud and he went seven times and on the seventh time he says i see a cloud about the size of a man's hand now you know amen that he wasn't looking at a cloud that was that size but what it was he was measuring you know they didn't have measure but he looked up and that cloud was about the measure of the size of his hand but the cloud up in the sky if he had gone was able to go to that cloud was far bigger than that and when he told elijah he said listen i see the cloud of the size of a man hand you know he says hurry up get in your chariot and go why because we're going to have an outpour i like that i like that but you see what happened the chariot was going too slow and that chariot represented the pentecostal church but this message is faster it's in a different dimension and what elijah running the way he was running what was happening he was in a different dimension you know no man can wear on like that amen without the help of the lord and what happened elijah beat amen ahab and the chariot and everything else to that place where he could see everything else you say tie that in because when we saw the cloud when the prophet of god was caught up he he was transferred uh transformed and changed into another dimension is that right and he ran faster than the pentecostal church in other words he was able to come back and tell us the future of what events would take place amen he told us amen about how jezebel would come and try to and kill and and put out a warrant oh you know a warrant you know what i mean by that for him in other words jezebel wants to kill him amen and you know of course that discouraged him but i'm trying to tell you something when god opened the seals he left pentecost back there and the message that we received since then hallelujah is a message of rapturing faith y'all understand me in other words i'm not doing away with it but i'm trying to tell you that it's already been judged leo this year's been judged she's been found wanting hallelujah god is not in laodicea because they put him out right so i'm saying these things to show you that we must concentrate on one thing he said one thing brothers one thing and and and we must make sure that this one thing of prophecy come to pass and what is that our translation one thing our maturing into christ one thing the fullness of god being manifested in us because we are the evidence of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7. y'all understand me we're the evidence we're the proof that is real when god began to transform us as he has been in these years he we it proves that this message is right because we have accomplished things within our personality that we know that could not have taken place without the supernatural visitation of the angels you understand me let this mind be in you what christian in the denominations understand that scripture you know what they do they water it down says he can't really mean that but he means exactly that let the mind of christ be in you and so i ask you the question what was the mind of christ but god himself see we think like men and god says quit thinking like men think like gods supposedly amen you was in a situation and an obstacle got in your way and you was a god would you fret no sir you tell the obstacle get out of my way because you're god of the obstacle but if you're a man you'll be fight fight excuse me you if you're a man we will be fainting like peter and the rest of them he said what do you mean remember when they were on the boat and the wind began to become bolsterous brother said that was a type in the shadow you know that right we're getting ready for a big storm hallelujah god is getting ready to test your faith not just here in in higher ground the whole christian world is getting ready for a real big storm he said the wind blew the oars away that means you couldn't travel you couldn't move it was it was he was being tossed whichever way the wind was tossing that little ship it had to move is that right there was nothing to guard it with the sails broke you know and they thought here is jesus asleep and brother said that's exactly right he's perhaps resting since the last revival and all they can do now y'all know how oh remember when brother was here oh remember what jesus did oh you know they were going through what they experienced in the past and they forgot that jesus was still on the ship see that's the thing as christian as message believers we have forgotten that jesus is still in the ship he's in there amen he preached a message go away jesus hallelujah another message he preached calling jesus on the scene he said you gotta awaken your consciousness y'all know what i'm saying hallelujah because we have a good conscience toward god by what the resurrection to know that jesus christ is still in the ship but we gotta awaken him we've got to stir him up in order to have a revival in our souls yes sir hallelujah that faith see i said that seraphinisian woman god took somebody that nobody knew faith finds sources that others don't see and when she heard she believed she might have heard it of a neighbor's girl being healed of epilepsy which the child had and they may have they might have heard of the epilepsy being healed so her daughter had needed need of healing and she had heard jesus could do it hallelujah now you say well brothers what are you saying you got to understand that faith presses through the crowd let me say that again faith presses through the crowd what crowd all of the crowds of unbelief faith presses through it when the crowd is trying to hinder you from the object who is jesus christ or from the object which is your healing faith presses through in other words get out of my way yes sometimes faith got to elbow you to get you out of the way but faith never quits and it's something that you can't explain to anybody you don't know how to tell them why you believe what you believe but you believe why you believe this message tell me how what makes you believe this message hallelujah you might say well brother books i'm an evidence i know what god has done for me well a pentecostal church could say the same thing hallelujah but it's deeper than that because this message gives you identity hallelujah remember i've said it before why you did not follow uh uh billy graham why are you not following billy graham why did not you follow uh uh oral roberts but when you heard this message you heard a scream you heard something that was familiar and it caused you to follow why because jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow hallelujah and i i feel like preaching but i got these quotes i got to read amen so really he said for he was god's word thomas jesus made flesh saint john 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever he was there to reveal the promises of god for his day you understand me there was a lot of people who faked it who pretended to be the elijah before the elijah came amen but you can't think it see he couldn't fake it in fact he didn't even know he was elijah for a long time but the gift that god had given to him right the bible said your gift will make room for you right so he had to manifest who what malachi fought he had to manifest revelation 10 7. he had to manifest luke 17 30. he had to manifest those scriptures and if he had not if he was not able to manifest that then he would have been thoughts according to the word but he hid every mark of the scripture describing who he was right he was why because he had christ god on the inside remember jesus did the same thing in his day hallelujah jesus said if you don't believe that i am he go search the scripture for in them they testify of me hallelujah and the prophet of our day could have said if you don't believe i'm the elijah he wasn't a proud man but he could have used it if you don't think that that i am he go search the scriptures find out what jesus promised in this day he promised that before the world in i will send you elijah hallelujah who elijah what the prophet i will send you elijah and not only that the son of man amen will be in this son of man and he will do the things that he did prior to the destruction of sodom and gomorrah he would have a gift of discernment did he prove it there were times several times he turned his back to the audience and called the names out of the people who needed healing and deliverance the same thing that the angels did amen when he met abraham in the cool of the evening here with sarah in the tent laughing at the promise hallelujah how can this thing be how can i have a child how can this thing be amen i'm old hallelujah how can this thing be my husband and i haven't seen pleasure in a long time and the bible said sarah laughed up her sleeve jesus or the son of man amen who visited abraham at that time says why did sarah laugh and sarah said i did not laugh she said yes you did right amen she didn't know who was visiting her hallelujah the prophet god said god would have killed her if she hadn't been part of abraham hallelujah you look at sarah but i want you to know we've been like sarah and god would have killed us long time ago had not we been a part of jesus christ oh hallelujah that's the way it is you know i was thinking there when they were singing that last song i forgot which one when it was but i thought oh my god i'm gonna see the fullness we're going to see the fullness y'all understand me you've been chosen to see the full manifestation of god hallelujah yes don't you understand i wish i had my cloud up here the cloud is not just uh something that god wanted to just take a picture of it came to signify something amen hallelujah it came to signify the defeat of all of the false prophets hallelujah did elijah them kill him he they did hallelujah you hear what i'm saying it it came to show amen that there is coming a fall of jezebel and her whole company that was a sign it was more than just seven angels it they came to signify god's victory over the devil and guess what nothing can stop it [Music] hallelujah amen not even jezebel right oh i'm going to kill him i'm going to kill him god god said yeah the dog's going to eat you up you see what i'm saying we're at a wonderful time that you and i are going to see god in a way we never thought we could see him you know what's going to happen but brother battle said listen he said it like this all that was in god he poured it into the to christ and all that was in christ important in the church what is it the fullness of god will be in the bride before she leaves here oh yeah you talking about a revival yes we've got it coming but it's a word revival because that word will identify god in you hallelujah it will manifest itself at its own will oh oh my god they haven't seen nothing yet it'll be a short quick work you say oh brother that's happening now partially but the pressure must come the test of faith must come you understand me god want to see you under pressure your reaction under pressure will declare who and what you are oh yes don't don't get me wrong amen supreme faith would give supreme grace in the supreme hour y'all understand me we don't have just any kind of faith we have supreme faith we have all an extra oil y'all hear what i'm saying we're not among the foolish we have oil and extra oil amen brother say he is here tonight to vindicate and to reveal every promise that god made for this age and what's been left off the bridges take up you hear me he is here to do it he was in the days of the prophets he was in moses he was in david he was in elijah he was in the rest of them to reveal god's promise of that age hallelujah this is what is so important that we could see that the rapture is on now there is a changing right now in you from glory to glory don't resist the hands of god let him mold you let him make you hallelujah and let and come to know that each trial come to make you strong hallelujah i'm excited tonight because i really believe that will not fall from the translation and after the translation comes the destruction of the world and it's coming it's coming why because i'm coming you coming amen you can't even you can't even break the chain hallelujah the pool that god's got on you is his pool you can't even stop him hallelujah he you're caught in the trap you're caught in the net hallelujah he's roped you he's tied you up he's tangled you up and you can't get away matter of fact a true believer don't want to get away hallelujah he was in the rest of them to reveal god's promise of that age god lauded his word to each age hallelujah and he sent a prophet and the word goes to the prophet and straightens it out and that's exactly what he has done through the all the ages don't you see that's why we can't repeat just what what pentecost did they they were worshiping devils and didn't even know it blood in their hands and blood in their forehead and all kinds of strange things witches among them and they thought they were they were spirit-filled people but the prophet of god came and identified every bit of it and made fun of him yes he did you understand he did the same thing the elijah did on mount carmel go call for your guard scream louder maybe he's on a vacation huh see you got to know what you got this message of revelation 10 7 let me tell you something if the world could have it they'd take it if if listen it's the truth even if pentecost knew what it was they would have never let it go but somebody had to play the part where the bible according to revelation said that he was going to make jezebel a bed in other words he was going to set it up so these people could be seduced huh you say what oh yeah god set it up because his word said that they would right and they would commit spiritual fornication with the we know who that is it's the catholic church they're gonna take us off to youtube if it's playing or not anyway but anyhow you must understand you can't be afraid this is not a time to be a shy of what you believe no somebody need to hear it don't be ashamed no no no no no lord no right if any time it's time to really tell people that god sent a prophet so that you can see christ and what he did in it jesus christ the same yesterday therefore people say you don't need to say that but well let me tell you like this you don't need to say that you use another name for noah then there's an ark right but let's get people to jesus with jesus which jesus because our jesus is a different jesus i ain't telling you to worship william branham but i'm gonna tell you you gotta let him know there's a message that came through him is that right listen let's go to egypt just for a moment because here was joseph's brothers and i'm jumping all over the place but joseph brother did not want to recognize the gift that was in him but look what happened he goes to egypt and everybody you came in contact with recognized that god was with joseph that's right amen that's the way it is the very people that should recognize jesus they don't the bible said he came to his own and his own received him not but to such that would receive him he gave them the power to become the sons of god hallelujah think about it potiphar recognized him here he was in the jail the thesis uh and the butler in the jail house recognized him from one prison hall for one prison he looked like he was getting deeper and deeper and deeper amen into some dark place you understand me see when god take a trial and it seems like every time you turn around you get go deeper you go deeper you go deeper you know what's next a resurrection hallelujah he's taking you down so he can bring you up hallelujah your trials are not there to consume you they're there to perfect you gold tried in the fire hallelujah and you say oh are you going yes amen you're a diamond in the rough so god got to chip you off some in order for you to reflect christ jesus through the light of god you're all right with that give me a few more minutes see he is on he's the one here in the form of the holy ghost who knows everything and can reveal anything that he desires to do she believed this and no matter how much people didn't believe faith finds a source that other people don't know nothing about and when a man has got faith in god he's got a hold of something that he can't explain it it's something that he's got to hold off he cannot push it or shove it or pull it it takes him hallelujah that's the way faith is when a man really got faith in god it finds that source that others don't see you love that now that's wonderful to me see and when you say well what brothers why are you saying maybe i'm maybe i'm losing my mind i i'll say it like this but i believe that when you're born of god it makes you an amateur god like when you're born a man you're born an amateur man right if you're born of god you're born an amateur god because you're born of the same substance that god is just like you're born of the same substance as a man as your as your father and mother is y'all understand me so when you look at this thing you say well why would god do that that's the full manifestation of god you can't you can't preach about adam and leave eve out eve was a part of adam regardless to what she was and what she did and it proved that she was part of him because he took her back hallelujah like god is taking us back we are part of him and without us he's not satisfied he can't be filled that's why he says eat the book eat it all up eat the word eat the flesh of the son of man drink the bloody bleeding word of jesus christ see he because because we become him as he has become us right see that image of the invisible god this is what i'm saying when you say oh brothers what are you trying to say what i'm trying to say is that if we don't if we how can i say it the handship is here and the headship is jesus christ himself you understand me we're just a body but he is the headship right so in order to be complete the body in the head must connect and the connection of the head and the body comes through the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah not just being baptized in water but baptized in the holy ghost right and you must mature and connect into christ where the body and the head is speaking the same thing the only way you can do that is remember his word hallelujah listen in the message putting on the whole arm of god uh here he says amen just like the word in the beginning was spoken to us in the garden of eden spoken word and the second time it was made flesh and dwelt among us and the third time it becomes part of us when the holy ghost dwelling in us god coming into a man whoa oh i'ma say it again i gotta say it again and the third time it becomes part of us when the holy ghost dwelling in us god coming into the man hallelujah that's like me wearing a suit i'm coming into the suit my flesh become god's clothing but inside the clothing is god himself help us jesus right amen god coming into the bands he first spoke the word the enemy tore it down then the word was made flesh he was crucified but now amen listen this but now there's a difference in the word the word is become the church and the church is the word oh my god you know what he just said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god so the church become god hallelujah she has the authority of god she has the power of god is that right jesus even said after which the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power and that power means authority this is where we fell from adam and eve had the same authority and now since the seals has been opened god takes us back to the beginning where the church is the authority of god on earth not the catholic church no the blood was churched all that god was he poured it in christ all that christ was poured into the church see the holy ghost now the enemy's got something right see then he isn't fighting something back here see so you and i must understand and i didn't know for a long time like i think i said it here before when i when i would read the scripture put on the whole i'm a god i thought i had to get the helmet from somewhere i had to get the breastplate from somewhere i had to get my short feet shot from somewhere i had to get different pieces of the armor out of the bible somewhere but i didn't understand that the fullness of the holy ghost is the armor of god jesus christ in you is his victory you understand me when god can stand in your shoes hallelujah that is your armor greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world i feel like shouting tonight yes i do why his presence has come we've seen his presence amen come through william branham but understand amen his coming and his presence is linked together right so you understand by the grace of god amen we're looking literally for changing of the body which body your body yes amen hallelujah and when that same presence has come into you the pillar of fire is now in you then you become the person of the logos huh brothers what are you talking about boy i'm telling you that i just not we didn't just begin my birth was in 1956 but i was before then you was before then but we came into this place to be tested and tried hallelujah but god knows the outcome he knows the end result that's why he put every one of our names in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world amen i hope i'm not going too fast brother okay amen i'm almost done i'm almost done one body we we the very essence see we in most people i'm telling you we must allow the holy spirit to mature us into christ we must because we're the evidence that this message is right they've forgotten about william brown and most of the people they've forgotten about the revivals and everything that took place now back then but we need to let them see he's alive and well the pentecostal church is dead they can sing they can shout speak in tongues you know sprutter like a car that needs a tune-up but you and i must understand the evidence that god word is true cannot be complete see the old testament cannot could not be complete without us we're the cap of the whole whole thing with the culmination i don't know whether you can say that the culmination of the whole thing with the crooks we're the end of it hallelujah the head of it somebody help me here oh my the bride of jesus christ is a part of his god here remember adam and eve was once adam adam you understand me now the whole earth is named after him jesus christ i'm almost done but i'm gonna read this quote here coming from christ it's the mystery of god and in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church hey somebody fullness expressed his god's head through his church and you know what the godhead means it means supreme authority the essence of being god the supreme being he wants to express the supreme being through us oh somebody ought to say hallelujah why because it's not by power not by mine but by my spirit says the lord it's not him that willeth nor he that runeth but god who shows mercy thank god for the mercies of god you said what are you talking about brother branham didn't want to be no preacher he ran from it he did not want to be a preacher and god had to spank him to get him to do what he wanted him to do when he was falling into the dark pits of hell he said oh lord if you get me out of this place i'll do whatever you want me to do you see what i'm saying and sometimes god has to take us that way in order to wake us up hallelujah i feel so good listen oh my he says what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom she's anointed people has to be anointed in order to bring back the bridegroom we can't we can't bring him back being lukewarm we can't bring him back being cold we must have that that anointing amen hmm know the man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down i like that i accept lord i accept whatever eve turned down i accept hallelujah and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept amen hallelujah we accept it oh lord i accept oh glory to god you love the lord we're just going to stop right now but i'll i will we'll quote this one which is a familiar one from patmos vision he said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together two omnipotents something's got to shake some whatever you say with that creative power of anointed of a whatever you say with that created power of an impetus of god see what i'm gonna say it again whatever whatsoever you say with that created power of the omnipotence of god knowing that he he's promised it and he said it is in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and bring things to pass things that is not it makes them as them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful we could be going through some stuff but i tell you what god god is faithful god is faithful and we ought to never forget how good he is to us i i wonder you know i said lord i want to love you with the same kind of love you love me i'm
