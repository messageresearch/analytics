[40:15] every morning
[40:18] amen he gives us his grace every morning
[40:25] [Music]
[40:27] so we don't have to take it for granted
[40:31] amen uh let's turn to uh II Peter
[40:35] chapter three we read the verse 9.
[40:43] foreign
[40:57] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[41:01] promise
[41:02] as some men count
[41:05] I'm sorry the Lord is not slack
[41:07] concerning his promise as some men
[41:10] counting his
[41:12] uh the Lord is not slack concerning his
[41:15] promise as some men count slackness but
[41:18] he is long-suffering to us uh to us word
[41:21] not willing that any should perish but
[41:25] also come to repentance
[41:38] amen I'll read it again the Lord is
[41:42] concerning this promise as some men
[41:44] count slackness
[41:46] but he's long-suffering to us word not
[41:50] willing that any Shall Perish but all
[41:53] shall come to repentance Louisiana
[42:16] Mercy Lord thank you Father God for
[42:19] everything that you have done for us
[42:21] Lord
[42:22] thank you for all the Miracles of Father
[42:25] God you did in our lives
[42:28] Lord thank you for your grace and your
[42:30] mercy in their renewed father God every
[42:32] morning
[42:34] Lord thank you for everything Lord Jesus
[42:37] Lord
[42:40] yeah we come here father God in your
[42:42] house Lord
[42:44] to serve you father put yourself Lord to
[42:47] praise you Lord Jesus Lord to have a
[42:50] fellowship with you with you lord lord
[42:53] to talk to you father Godly so that you
[42:56] can talk back to US national policy Lord
[42:58] to learn father God more about you
[43:00] foreign
[43:06] Lord we thank you Father for everything
[43:09] so we pray father God that your spirit
[43:11] leads everything father this morning
[43:14] we pray father God that you forgive all
[43:17] our sins
[43:19] Lord you forgive all our iniquities
[43:22] Lord make us wine wider than snow
[43:26] fatherless
[43:29] to be a whole in your Praises but we
[43:33] pray that you bless every heart so
[43:35] father God hearing this is
[43:40] the way father God we pray that you
[43:42] bless him Lord
[43:44] Lord let everything be done in your name
[43:48] in Jesus Christ
[43:51] amen amen
[43:54] amen you may be seated with as well amen
[43:57] this morning I have a God's grace we
[44:00] have a little subject that wanted to
[44:02] share with you but I guess is
[44:06] why not me and why not now
[44:10] this is
[44:12] why not me why not now
[44:17] amen because what we read in the Bible
[44:19] will see that the Bible says that the
[44:22] Lord is not slacks
[44:28] amen concerning his promises
[44:53] because we know that life is nothing but
[44:56] a totality of conscious choices
[45:01] [Music]
[45:05] that would continuously make
[45:08] life is nothing but a choice
[45:12] what is it what do you mean by that the
[45:15] difference
[45:16] what you do everything but what you do
[45:19] every day is a choice
[45:22] amen you decide to wake up to stand out
[45:25] of me to wake up on your bed it's a
[45:27] choice
[45:28] I mean if you decide to say if you
[45:31] decide to stay sleeping all day still a
[45:34] choice
[45:39] when you eat it's a juice that you make
[45:41] you want to eat
[45:44] you want to stay hungry it's still a
[45:46] choice
[45:48] well even when you don't feel like
[45:50] choosing and you stay on neutral it's
[45:52] still a choice
[45:54] so everything that we do every day in
[45:57] our lives is a choice
[46:00] and so the choices that we make will
[46:04] determine where we'll spend our eternity
[46:15] and the choices that we make amen we're
[46:17] having will have an impact now before in
[46:20] our neighbor's lives
[46:25] so that's what we have to carefully
[46:27] choose what we do foreign
[46:31] carefully choose the choice that we make
[46:37] you see the Young Rich ruler
[46:40] amen he had a choice to make
[46:43] and then he had to either follow Jesus
[46:46] or his riches
[46:49] and he made his choice
[46:52] that was the wrong one
[46:57] amen here the prophet says your
[47:00] Eternal destination is a choice
[47:05] and maybe tonight some of you will make
[47:09] that choice
[47:12] of where you spend your eternity
[47:18] before this service Ends Tonight
[47:23] this morning there will be there'll be
[47:27] one time
[47:29] if you turn God down on many times there
[47:33] will be one time you're turning down you
[47:34] turn him down the last time see foreign
[48:36] about where you want to spend your
[48:38] eternity
[48:46] amen it's not a gift that is freely
[48:49] given to you
[48:51] but you have to choose
[48:54] amen you have to decide
[48:57] we sing that I have decided to follow
[49:00] Jesus
[49:04] amen I give my life to Christ and I have
[49:07] decided to follow Jesus Christ amen it's
[49:10] a decision that you make
[49:12] and that decision will determine where
[49:15] you'll spend your eternity
[49:22] wisely the prophet is
[49:27] not to postpone it for a long time
[49:33] because there is a line between judgment
[49:36] and mercy
[49:37] [Music]
[49:39] there is a line that is between judgment
[49:42] and mercy
[49:44] amen and and then if you step if you
[49:48] step across that line there is no
[49:49] turning back civil foreign
[50:36] Peter said the Lord no we gave
[50:39] everything away
[50:41] to follow you no we made our choice to
[50:45] follow him
[50:46] but now where we will go if we if it's
[50:50] not to you I mean
[50:52] no we give up everything
[50:55] what are we having back in return
[50:58] he says I will give you a hundred foot
[51:00] of everything that you have lost
[51:03] but on top of that you also have
[51:05] tribulations
[51:08] they had to make their choices
[51:12] they had to decide whether to follow the
[51:14] the rest who left Jesus or to stay with
[51:17] him
[51:21] amen they decided to stay with him
[51:24] and you see that Jacob also had to make
[51:27] a choice
[51:29] when he heard that his brother was
[51:31] coming back was coming to him with 400
[51:33] men to kill him
[52:35] you had to make a wise choice
[52:43] amen but he went to the Lord
[52:45] amen he went to the Lord and prayed amen
[52:49] that was his wife's choice that he made
[52:51] to decide because right there and right
[52:54] then
[52:55] his life was changed and his family was
[53:00] safe
[53:02] so the prophet said that there may be
[53:05] men and women sitting here tonight
[53:12] that death lays right before you he Dona
[53:16] more
[53:18] and the only way that you'll be you'll
[53:20] ever be able to achieve that thing today
[53:23] uh the thing that you wanting is
[53:32] to desperately come
[53:36] is to desperate to desperately come
[53:39] he said that I might I must have it
[53:44] I get it now I'm oh I'm finished
[53:48] tomorrow is too late I must have it now
[53:52] when you pray for the baptism of the
[53:55] Holy Spirit
[53:56] the token senior don't say well now I'll
[54:01] go up and try it
[54:04] Lord I'm a little tired
[54:07] oh mercy oh misery stay in your seat
[54:12] don't even make an attempt
[54:15] if you come and say
[54:17] well I'll pass I'll pass through the
[54:20] prayer line put the oil in my head and
[54:23] I'll see if that does me any good
[54:25] message
[54:30] you might as well said where you where
[54:33] you at
[54:35] until you get to that place
[54:40] until the whole church gets to that
[54:43] place to a place
[54:46] that it's between death and life
[54:51] you've got to heaven now perish
[54:57] amen that God will move on the scene
[55:01] amen because it takes desperation to
[55:04] bring God on the scene if foreign
[55:17] amen you have to be like Esther the vet
[55:20] come is there amen if I perish let me
[55:22] perish
[55:23] amen because I'm going to see the king
[55:26] amen if I perish let me perish amen
[55:30] because I have made my decision
[55:32] amen My Mind Is Made Up more money amen
[55:36] I have to get I have to see the king
[55:39] amen I'm going to see the king amen
[55:42] because I have to save my people
[55:45] amen so it's about life and death so
[55:49] when you come to that position
[55:51] when you come to that desperate time
[55:55] but that's when God comes to the scene
[55:58] amen that's when God acts
[56:01] amen that's when God did comes down she
[56:04] also wanted to do this amen when you're
[56:06] desperate amen when you don't have any
[56:09] other options
[56:10] amen when you totally depend on God
[56:14] Amen that's when he comes down to help
[56:16] you see like this song foreign
[58:14] so now we have decided to follow him
[59:16] and then and you see that he was
[59:18] rewarded afterwards
[59:21] because there is a reward after a
[59:24] decision
[59:25] there is a reward after every decision
[59:28] that we make
[59:30] decision amen but it's not always a good
[59:32] reward
[59:34] if you choose not to serve God
[59:37] Amen your reward is to go to hell
[59:40] remember if you choose to serve him
[59:43] amen your reward is to spend the
[59:46] eternity with him
[59:48] that New Jerusalem
[59:57] himself
[1:00:00] that's only if you decide to choose him
[1:00:07] she said
[1:00:10] he said rest Ruth because the men will
[1:00:14] have no rest you know foreign
[1:00:42] [Music]

[1:33:35] mean amen I'll read the prophet and
[1:33:38] we'll probably close after this one
[1:33:40] he said that if God was so merciful to
[1:33:43] forgive a man of his sins the situation
[1:33:47] is
[1:33:49] and to give him eternal life
[1:33:54] he ought to be so reverent before God
[1:33:58] all the days of his life
[1:34:05] that he will never turn his feet from
[1:34:08] God's testimonies
[1:34:12] you should always walk upright before

[1:34:50] in trouble and then see God
[1:34:57] it's best to find him now
[1:35:00] for it is written that he is a very
[1:35:04] present help in time of trouble
[1:35:09] don't wait until things don't go well

[1:35:17] but it is best to serve him now
[1:35:20] remain in his best to look for him now
[1:35:24] he may look for him when he can still be
[1:35:27] found
[1:35:29] because there is a time for everything

[1:35:36] time for judgment
