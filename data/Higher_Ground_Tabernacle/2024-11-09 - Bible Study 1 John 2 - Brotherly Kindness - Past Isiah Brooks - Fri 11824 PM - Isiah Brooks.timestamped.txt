[1:06] um brotherly
[1:09] love it is something that we all

[1:17] Amazing Grace
[1:20] and all that he's doing for
[1:23] US 1 John 2
[1:27] 1-10 my little children the these things
[1:30] right I unto you that you sin not and if
[1:35] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:39] father Jesus Christ the
[1:41] righteous and he is the propit for our
[1:47] sins and not for ours only but also for
[1:51] the sins of the whole
[1:54] world and hereby we know we do know that
[1:57] we know him if we keep his
[2:02] Commandments he that saith I know him
[2:05] and keepeth not his commandment is a
[2:08] liar and the truth is not in
[2:10] him but whosoever keepeth his word in
[2:13] him verely is the love of God
[2:16] perfected hereby know we that we are
[2:21] know we that we are in him he that saith
[2:25] he abideth in him ought himself also to
[2:30] walk even as he
[2:31] walked Brethren I write no new
[2:34] commandment unto you but an old
[2:37] commandment which ye had from the
[2:39] beginning the old commandment is the
[2:41] word which you have heard from the
[2:44] beginning and again a new commandment I
[2:46] write unto you which thing is true in
[2:50] him and in you because the darkness is
[2:54] passed and the True Light now
[2:56] shineth he that saith he is in the light
[2:59] and hateth his brother is in darkness
[3:02] even to
[3:04] now he that loveth his brother abideth
[3:07] in the light and there is not occasion
[3:10] of stumbling in
[3:12] him let us pray father God we thank you
[3:16] Father for the reading of your word Lord
[3:19] we ask oh God that you lead us and guide
[3:22] us into this message or into this
[3:24] subject tonight many many many things
[3:27] could be said oh God but pray that you
[3:30] would open our hearts and our mouth and
[3:32] our minds that we might be able to
[3:34] receive something tonight that will
[3:37] further our our walk with you Lord bless
[3:40] us now in your lovely name Jesus Christ
[3:43] we pray
[3:45] amen you may be
[3:53] seated when we talk about
[3:57] love everybody think they know what it
[4:02] is but love is a very very very deep
[4:10] subject we have what we call ailio love
[4:15] which is love between man
[4:20] Mankind and then we have the love that
[4:24] we know that is just agapy love that's
[4:27] the perfect
[4:28] love by the way I don't even talk about
[4:31] love how that love God is love as the
[4:35] scripture says but as it trickles down
[4:38] from where he is to where we
[4:42] are it's almost in a place of of a
[4:46] perverted
[4:49] State when we think
[4:51] about the power of love you can just
[4:55] look around and
[4:57] see it's love that keeping everything
[5:00] together even
[5:03] now love is something that I believe
[5:07] Adam and Eve truly
[5:09] had when they were first formed and made
[5:12] by God they had a love that connected
[5:16] them in such a way they understood who
[5:19] they were and their relationship what
[5:22] their relationship was
[5:24] to each other as well as to
[5:28] God but because of the fall things have
[5:31] fallen and now mankind is in a place
[5:35] where God is trying to restore us to
[5:38] that perfect place that perfect human
[5:40] being that perfect Son of God and the
[5:44] only way that he knows that this can be
[5:46] done is by way of
[5:49] Love really the Bible said love conquers
[5:53] all things and when you read even in
[5:56] Corinthians where it talks about charity
[5:59] the or original word for charity is love
[6:02] that was kind of changed but the the
[6:06] definition of charity or the definition
[6:08] of Love Is Love and somehow when you
[6:11] talk about charity you think about just
[6:14] giving to people oh they gave that's the
[6:17] charitable organization they give here
[6:19] they give that but but love is more than
[6:22] just
[6:23] giving love is
[6:26] protecting love is Sheltering
[6:30] love is
[6:31] defending you know love it's it's uh how
[6:35] can I say it is when it's God it
[6:39] provides so there's so many facets to
[6:43] love and the world lacks it all we
[6:48] understand that the Bible even tells us
[6:49] that's in the last days that the
[6:51] Christians love will wax cold because of
[6:55] the trials because of the Temptations
[6:57] because of the lack of
[7:00] their love for
[7:02] God but here it says my little children
[7:04] these things right unto you that ye what
[7:06] sin not and of course we understand what
[7:10] sin is it means to
[7:13] disbelieve because if you if you
[7:15] disbelieve the word of God it makes the
[7:18] Temptation easier it makes it easier to
[7:22] fall you understand me but when you
[7:24] believe that what God has taught you uh
[7:29] right from wrong and you
[7:30] believe uh that what God teaches you in
[7:34] his word is right then you stay with the
[7:37] right and you sha the wrong brother
[7:40] random said before a man could ever go
[7:42] in
[7:44] error he has to refuse the
[7:47] truth and that's how it is before you
[7:49] can even fall in sin you have to refuse
[7:52] the truth because the Holy Ghost is
[7:56] faithful If any man sin we have a a
[8:00] advate what is an advocate anybody knows
[8:03] right
[8:09] off yes yes and and and yeah someone
[8:13] anyone who who speaks in
[8:17] favor of you or to recommend or argue or
[8:21] calls for you kind of like a
[8:23] lawyer and uh that's what he is for us
[8:26] he's an attorney that stands
[8:30] for
[8:35] us
[8:37] uhhuh oh yes okay okay so yeah that's
[8:42] good to
[8:43] know so we understand that we we have a
[8:47] lawyer H who who knows who that lawyer
[8:50] is amen praise the Lord amen thank God
[8:54] because he we know he's a righteous
[8:56] lawyer he's a a true lawyer he's a judge
[8:59] he's he's a a merciful lawyer I mean
[9:03] he's one that if you want to say shrewd
[9:06] when it comes to the
[9:07] devil he doesn't take any he doesn't
[9:10] play so we thank God for that Advocate
[9:14] that's always going before
[9:16] us what made him such an
[9:20] advocate yes
[9:27] brother yes
[9:32] yes that's exactly right that's what the
[9:34] scripture says we have not a high priest
[9:37] that cannot be touched by the feelings
[9:39] of our infirmities so Jesus Christ had
[9:42] God himself came as a man as a flesh man
[9:46] that he may understand Mankind and his
[9:50] suffering and because he can understand
[9:52] our suffering because the Bible said he
[9:54] was tried in every point but without sin
[9:59] yes and so therefore he can defend our
[10:03] case before God
[10:06] right because really remember brother B
[10:09] said we we we're failures to begin with
[10:12] we we came in as a failure right so he
[10:16] is the perpetuation for our sins and not
[10:20] for ours only but also for the sins of
[10:24] the whole world so what does that word
[10:27] pritu means
[10:36] that's good that he satisfies the wrath
[10:39] of
[10:40] God and that's basically what the blood
[10:42] of Jesus Christ uh does for
[10:45] us because when Jesus when God sees the
[10:48] blood he passes over us to know that
[10:51] there was a real sacrificial lamb who
[10:54] was his dear son Jesus
[10:56] Christ uh and so when he sees that blood
[11:01] he passes over us because while as long
[11:04] as we in Christ as long as we are under
[11:06] the blood we are
[11:09] accepted in Christ so thank God for the
[11:12] blood thank God for the
[11:15] advocate because we need them
[11:19] both right and the Bible says hereby we
[11:24] do know that we know him if we keep his
[11:28] Commandments
[11:30] so I I have to say it like
[11:33] this one of the things that I I I whenu
[11:38] disal uh uh uh service in our country
[11:42] was pretty much U biblical
[11:46] based uh you know it or Fair pretty much
[11:50] fair uh they gave people mercy and
[11:55] Grace and one of the things that they
[11:58] would say to you you all right we're
[12:00] going to let you go on these
[12:03] charges but don't let me see you back in
[12:07] here with the same
[12:10] charges and and that was like Mercy that
[12:13] was Grace because really sometimes they
[12:16] even had um evidence but it all depend
[12:22] on uh sometimes how how mature you are
[12:27] or how it how influenced you were of of
[12:31] by some others and and the judge would
[12:34] always look at all the evidence and you
[12:37] know basically judge things by the
[12:39] evidence and many people went free and
[12:41] of course when things began to get
[12:43] crooked you know things change but when
[12:46] it comes to God you got to realize that
[12:49] he's as brother said he's the judge he's
[12:52] the jury he's the attorney you know what
[12:55] I mean and so you got the whole Court of
[12:59] in in your
[13:00] favor and the the verdict of the whole
[13:05] thing is that you never sin in the first
[13:08] place so and this is very important
[13:12] because a lot of times people don't
[13:14] understand why is important to have the
[13:16] Holy Ghost because this is a applicable
[13:19] only to those who have the Holy Ghost
[13:23] you see what I'm saying I mean
[13:25] potentially you're free but once God
[13:28] approves moves you and seals you with
[13:31] the Holy Ghost you are totally free and
[13:35] that's when that scripture come into
[13:36] play he whom the son set free is free
[13:41] indeed often Christians don't even
[13:43] realize how free they are I mean even
[13:46] some with the Holy Ghost don't
[13:48] understand how free they are and I'm
[13:52] going to read a quote down the line to
[13:54] to show you how free you are um
[13:59] and that's what you call that's what
[14:00] makes people love when you know God has
[14:02] loved you it makes you love
[14:05] others right and we have said it all the
[14:08] time I love him because he first loved
[14:11] me right so that love that God gives to
[14:15] us is not to be kept to ourselves but is
[14:18] to be funel out to other people because
[14:20] that's what people God wants the world
[14:22] to know that he loved them is that right
[14:25] St John 3:16 for God so loved the world
[14:28] that he gave his own only begotten son
[14:30] that whosoever believeth in him should
[14:31] not perish but have everlasting life and
[14:36] all of us should know that when the
[14:38] blood of Jesus Christ struck the Earth
[14:41] the whole earth was saved amen that's
[14:44] right and the only way people go to hell
[14:46] today is that they reject the
[14:49] blood all right so hereby do we how
[14:53] hereby we do know that we know him if we
[14:58] keep his Commandments
[15:00] he people say well I don't know I just
[15:01] don't want to be baptized in the name of
[15:03] the Lord Jesus Christ I've been baptized
[15:05] Father Son and Holy Ghost and that's
[15:07] good enough for me let me ask you a
[15:09] question is the trinitarian baptism a
[15:13] baptism absolutely not it's just putting
[15:17] somebody in the water and bringing them
[15:20] up God does not consider that as a
[15:23] baptism even though when we talk about a
[15:25] baptism it meanss to be
[15:27] covered but it's a wrong
[15:29] name it's the wrong
[15:32] formula if you had an algebra
[15:36] project uh problem and you just wrote
[15:39] down everything that the problem was and
[15:41] never never worked it out you wouldn't
[15:45] you get a zero that problem is set there
[15:49] on the left and you're supposed to work
[15:50] it out and bring the answer to the right
[15:54] right so that's how it is Father Son and
[15:56] Holy Ghost one name
[15:59] I'm saying this because there's so many
[16:01] people I got friends right now who I
[16:03] love dearly fellowship with them
[16:05] whenever I can who are denominational
[16:08] Christians I've shown them acts 238 and
[16:12] they claim to love God matter of fact
[16:14] they seem to have a greater
[16:16] witnessing you know what I mean they can
[16:18] tell people about Jesus better than I
[16:22] can but when it comes to the word
[16:24] because of their Traditions they love
[16:26] their church more than they love God
[16:29] right so the Bible said if here's here
[16:32] the way we know you if you keep his
[16:34] Commandments and that is commandment and
[16:36] they say well no no no no no I'd rather
[16:39] uh believe what what Jesus said than
[16:42] what Peter
[16:43] said not realizing that Peter had the
[16:47] revelation of what Jesus said in Matthew
[16:52] 28:19 right and that is a revelation it
[16:55] is something that God has to give to you
[16:57] he that say I know him and keep not his
[17:01] commandment is a liar and the truth is
[17:05] not in
[17:07] him and that's that's that's reality yes
[17:11] sir right but whoo El who but who so
[17:15] keepeth his word and this is what I
[17:17] don't understand in the book of Acts
[17:19] where the church the New Testament
[17:20] Church first started they asked Peter
[17:25] who is the Sportsman of Jesus Christ who
[17:27] is the preacher of that day
[17:29] because the Bible said they were pricked
[17:30] in their hearts when they recognized and
[17:33] realized they had crucified the Lord and
[17:35] they asked Peter what must we do and
[17:38] Peter never quoted uh Matthew
[17:42] 28:19 he said repent and be baptized in
[17:46] the name of of Jesus Christ for the
[17:49] remission of your sins and you shall
[17:51] receive the gift of the Holy
[17:54] Ghost but that was the action part of
[17:58] Matthew 28:19 y'all hear what I'm saying
[18:01] this is very important because if if if
[18:04] you reject the smaller part how you
[18:06] going to get the bigger you learn your
[18:09] ABCs you go to algebra that's right you
[18:12] know but who so keepeth his word in him
[18:15] verely is the love of God perfected
[18:18] hereby we know that we are in him
[18:22] anybody want to expound on that
[18:25] one but whosoever keepeth his word in
[18:29] him verely is the love of God
[18:32] perfected let me put it this way the
[18:35] love of God
[18:38] matures because when you Perfection is
[18:41] maturity on this level I'm speaking of
[18:44] you can add all these virtues and all of
[18:46] these virtues bring you to a maturity to
[18:49] a proper son and daughter of God that
[18:53] God will uh uhh adopt you and put you
[18:57] out there because he trust you you are
[19:00] matured you you're not you're not with
[19:02] childish things anymore you you
[19:04] literally doing what God wants you to
[19:07] do without
[19:13] grudging you know I look at those early
[19:15] Saints there in Ephesus and how they
[19:19] just were so obedient at the beginning
[19:22] you know the Antichrist did come in on
[19:24] them they were aimed
[19:25] at aimed at and what relaxed
[19:29] and whenever you get relaxed in
[19:32] Christianity Satan has his focus on
[19:36] you that's why God said he would that we
[19:38] be hot or cold right he wants us to be
[19:42] hot right and I'm I'm I'm crying out now
[19:45] for more fire you know what I mean
[19:47] because I don't want the fire just to
[19:49] exist in church I want the fire to exist
[19:52] outside wherever I go right so how we
[19:56] know that we're perfected because the
[19:58] love of God and understand this it is
[20:02] the love of God that gives you faith it
[20:05] the love of God that gives you virtue
[20:07] every step of the way has been is being
[20:10] led you're being led by the love of God
[20:14] because each one of those virtues are
[20:18] victories and I'm not I'm not talking
[20:20] about a victory with a
[20:22] dog I'm talking about Victory with human
[20:24] beings God will test you in every Way by
[20:30] human beings
[20:33] people because you in a
[20:36] war and you are in a war to do what
[20:39] conquer this land just like Joshua had
[20:42] to conquer the land of Jericho I mean uh
[20:44] the Canaan you have to conquer this land
[20:48] and the only way we can conquer This
[20:50] Land Is God put oppositions in front of
[20:52] us that's right yeah
[20:56] people and guess what you you got to
[20:59] love him right he that say he abideth in
[21:05] him ought himself also to walk even as
[21:10] he
[21:11] walked now is that
[21:14] complicated I I put it this
[21:17] way if I had a
[21:21] uniform let's say a duck because a lot
[21:24] of people put on all kinds of
[21:25] ducks ducks and other any kind of thing
[21:29] but if I'm abiding in that duck that
[21:31] means I got that whole uniform
[21:34] on and however I walk the duck walk
[21:38] that's right we have become one this is
[21:41] what he's saying now if we abide in him
[21:44] all alter himself also to so walk even
[21:47] as he walk and abideth means to stay
[21:51] remain and wait or wait amen so you you
[21:55] you you in him right and as he walk like
[21:59] Jesus says I can do nothing except the
[22:01] father show me so everything that you're
[22:03] doing you're being led by the spirit
[22:07] because the Bible said they that are led
[22:08] by the spirit they are the sons of God
[22:12] so so in this love and listen when you
[22:16] love someone you're willing to
[22:21] sacrifice and God loves the sacrifice of
[22:23] praise and there are times that you
[22:25] worship God even in sacrifice so times
[22:30] that God will ask you to do something
[22:32] when your flesh do not want to do
[22:34] it right but you do it anyway for an
[22:39] example I was going through something
[22:41] just recently and and I won't say that
[22:44] I'm
[22:45] completely Victorious I've gotten a
[22:47] complete Victory but one of the things
[22:49] that God said to me like a natural
[22:54] man and he was telling me about
[22:59] perfect
[23:02] love is living for
[23:07] others you know you can't you know
[23:10] selfishness can't be in the
[23:13] equation it's perfect
[23:16] love yes brother did you you
[23:29] yeah everything he
[23:31] yeah yeah yeah y everything he did was
[23:36] living for others yeah that's why he
[23:38] asked God never asked us to do something
[23:40] that he himself won't do or haven't done
[23:44] so this is what he's that love will live
[23:48] for others right and and I learn I'm
[23:52] learning see I'm learning that because
[23:55] you know when when how can I selfishness
[23:58] or what whatever the case may be when
[24:00] it's day you're not
[24:02] dead that's right that's right you're
[24:04] not quite dead yet but when you're dead
[24:07] and you're Rod then you know you you you
[24:10] you you go wherever the spirit leads you
[24:12] to
[24:12] go right Brethren I write no new
[24:16] commandment unto you but an old
[24:19] commandment which you had from the
[24:22] beginning the old commandment is the
[24:24] word which you have heard from the
[24:27] beginning again a new commandment I
[24:31] write unto you which things is true in
[24:34] him and in you because the darkness is
[24:38] passed and the True Light now shineth
[24:42] now what in Earth John is talking
[24:46] about I I I'll tell you darkness is
[24:50] passed and remember amen that
[24:54] uh when Jesus
[24:56] died everything went dark
[24:58] dark the moon refused to shine you know
[25:02] everything and you got to realize that
[25:04] was a that was the darkest of all
[25:08] ours but that same Darkness also brought
[25:12] forth light and you say what do you mean
[25:15] without Darkness you can't see
[25:18] light light is always there yall
[25:21] understand me it takes the darkness to
[25:24] manifest what is light what light is
[25:27] like the the night Stars right
[25:30] supposedly the Sun goes out if the sun
[25:34] goes out it would be what complete
[25:38] darkness see but here Jesus Christ is
[25:41] now manifested as the
[25:44] light he is the light am and because he
[25:49] is the light we say we walk in the light
[25:50] so what was the light what was it Jesus
[25:54] said father forgive them for they know
[25:56] not what they do Jesus said to Judas
[25:59] betray me with a kiss Jesus said even to
[26:02] the religious man he loved him right
[26:06] right so so no matter what the
[26:09] differences were of whatever anyone
[26:13] brought love always Prevail and that's
[26:16] that's the Bible love conquers
[26:19] all love is not
[26:22] selfish is is that the word love seeketh
[26:26] not her own love is not puffed
[26:30] up you know what when you love somebody
[26:33] you got to
[26:34] suffer it doesn't come
[26:37] easy but it's there for because God how
[26:42] can I say it you
[26:44] know I I I put it this
[26:47] way I think uh let's use a
[26:50] cow when a cow have
[26:54] calves that cow never complains
[26:58] well a real mother
[27:00] won't but that real mother calf will
[27:03] never complain about those
[27:06] babies even a dog sometime I I've seen
[27:10] dogs nursing those little puppies and
[27:13] just looking at them about drive me
[27:15] crazy and she lay there so patiently
[27:18] yall understand me because she knows
[27:20] she's there to give out now they're
[27:23] taking from her and she and that's her
[27:26] love that's her love and she's willing
[27:29] to lay down her life to feed those
[27:32] babies to feed those puppies no matter
[27:35] what it takes so that's the way it is
[27:37] with a
[27:39] Christian some Christians are just
[27:43] takers pray for those that despitefully
[27:46] use you the Bible
[27:48] says and you just have to let them do it
[27:52] sometimes ain't nobody going to make me
[27:54] a
[27:56] fool well I put it this
[27:58] way you either obey God or you
[28:01] don't and I want that kind of love that
[28:05] I could love no matter what the
[28:07] circumstances
[28:10] are because in that people will see you
[28:14] are a
[28:16] Christian I mean it's it's like this
[28:19] when somebody shout at you and you shout
[28:23] back at them you're not dead yet that's
[28:26] right
[28:28] because a dead man yes sir cannot
[28:32] respond that's the truth all of us need
[28:35] to die a little more right a dead man
[28:38] does not respond kick a dead man he
[28:40] won't even
[28:42] grunt matter of fact you can go over to
[28:44] a dead man and Rob his pocket and he
[28:47] still won't say nothing to you that's
[28:50] what a dead man does so you got to
[28:53] understand what God is requiring from us
[28:55] you say well what do you mean brother
[28:57] Brooks the Bible said they slapped him
[28:59] they spat on him they they they mocked
[29:02] him and he opened not his mouth he said
[29:04] not a mumbling word ain't that amazing
[29:08] and the Bible said walk in the light as
[29:10] he is in the light if you say you in the
[29:12] light you're supposed to live like he
[29:15] lived that's the
[29:18] truth help us Jesus because John knows
[29:21] what he's talking
[29:26] about the darkg has
[29:29] passed we ourselves can say okay we once
[29:34] understood God according to
[29:36] organizations and denomination now that
[29:38] Darkness has passed now we're in the
[29:41] light in the light the revelation of the
[29:44] word for our day and this is what we
[29:47] supposed to walk as what Sons and
[29:50] Daughters of God redeemed Sons and
[29:53] Daughters of God powerful Sons and
[29:56] Daughters of God right and this is what
[29:59] the we got to become listen people oh
[30:02] the Pentecost is this the Pentecost is
[30:04] that you and me or we must move up
[30:08] higher amen we our lives must we we must
[30:11] live higher amen than they did that's
[30:15] right Miracles everything else must be
[30:19] higher amen right because every age was
[30:22] a step higher sir and we can't look down
[30:25] back or even down at them if we're not
[30:28] not even living on that level and won't
[30:29] you you better understand those real
[30:32] Pentecostals were real Pentecostals and
[30:35] they did not even have as far as
[30:37] knowledge what we
[30:39] have but you know what they were willing
[30:42] to
[30:43] die died to the age in which they came
[30:46] out
[30:47] of and we must learn how to die to the
[30:51] age that we came out
[30:54] of again a new commandment right I write
[30:58] unto you which things is true in him and
[31:00] in him and in you because the darkness
[31:02] is passed and the True Light now shineth
[31:05] anybody need to say anything everybody
[31:08] any
[31:09] compliment okay I mean comment not
[31:12] compliment comment
[31:15] sorry he that saith he is in the light
[31:17] and do what hateth his brother is in
[31:20] darkness even until now so God don't
[31:23] care about your
[31:25] religion he don't even care how faithful
[31:27] you've being to church and Todd ping and
[31:30] offerings and all of the things that but
[31:33] if you have hatred in your heart for
[31:36] your brother or sister he said you are a
[31:40] liar but you don't know what he did to
[31:43] me hey have you suffered like Christ
[31:47] did what about what about I love Stephen
[31:50] because Stephen to me is such a powerful
[31:53] example here this man he's not even a
[31:57] preacher
[31:58] amen but he says Lord hold not these he
[32:02] had so much
[32:04] love he was asking God to forgive
[32:09] them you know he wasn't even like Abel
[32:12] Abel say Lord get
[32:14] him Abel wanted
[32:17] Revenge but the Bible said we have a
[32:19] greater we have a more word of Prophecy
[32:22] a greater word of Prophecy because now
[32:25] we are love love love does what love
[32:30] forgives right I'm trying to get I'm
[32:33] just trying to go I got to hurry up
[32:35] though I'm moving moving too slow all
[32:39] right he that saith he is in the light
[32:42] and hate his brothers in darkness even
[32:43] now he that loveth his brother abideth
[32:46] in the light and there is not an
[32:48] occasion of stumbling in
[32:52] him
[32:54] right so when you are in the light
[32:57] you're kind of like Jesus when when your
[32:59] brother say something that you know that
[33:02] is not of God of course you don't have
[33:04] to call him Satan but you recognize it's
[33:07] Satan not your brother that's right so
[33:10] you don't stumble you know I had
[33:13] something uh and I honestly I had some
[33:15] things said to me uh uh early this
[33:18] morning and that really uh had me
[33:23] going but but I realized you know
[33:26] people can and say things under the
[33:29] inspiration of the devil and they don't
[33:30] even realize they're saying it that's
[33:32] right you have to make excuses for
[33:34] people but because when people say
[33:37] things it doesn't mean it's not going to
[33:38] hurt but you got to make excuses for
[33:41] them love covers a multitude of sin
[33:46] that's right so in order to keep peace
[33:48] within your heart and your love flowing
[33:50] for that individual or individuals you
[33:53] must Realize by the grace of God that it
[33:57] was the en we ration not against flesh
[33:59] and blood for Spiritual wickedness in
[34:01] high places and Satan always have you as
[34:05] a
[34:07] Target
[34:10] right listen it says what you know
[34:13] you're not you're not going to you say
[34:14] you're in the light and then you're
[34:15] going to cause your brother to stumble
[34:18] you know what you're doing wrong or you
[34:20] know what you just said is going to
[34:22] stumble your brother that's not love
[34:24] that's right well he said it to me so I
[34:26] thought I'd go back at at him that's not
[34:29] love anytime you feel like you got to
[34:32] Revenge yourself you have stepped
[34:35] outside of what we call
[34:37] love right or defend
[34:40] yourself when you know you're right you
[34:42] don't necessarily need to defend
[34:44] yourself unless the occasion calls for
[34:47] you to defend
[34:51] yourself yes even in my situation could
[34:55] have been a real mess but I kept my
[34:57] mouth sh
[34:59] by the grace of
[35:02] God and others that heard the comment
[35:06] pretty much dropped their
[35:08] head but nevertheless let let me read
[35:11] something to
[35:16] you brother was talking about the early
[35:18] church and we need talk when I'm saying
[35:20] the early church and I'm talking about
[35:22] something that uh like 8033 or something
[35:25] I'm talking about the early church when
[35:27] he started it out and I don't know
[35:29] whether my wife remember when we went to
[35:32] the Pentecostal church when we first
[35:34] people loved each other now you had some
[35:38] you going always have Rebels but there
[35:41] were times that people did not even want
[35:43] to leave each other after church because
[35:45] the services were so great and so when I
[35:48] read this this kind of brought my mind
[35:50] back to the way it used to be brother R
[35:54] say they love one another till I haven't
[35:57] seen people people love one another
[36:00] that's the Lord that's what the church
[36:03] was established upon that Godly
[36:06] brotherly love for one another I seen
[36:09] them even shake hands with one another
[36:12] leaving the place and crying like babies
[36:16] to leave one another they loved one
[36:20] another that that well and I could go to
[36:23] their house to visit them and times the
[36:26] Bible was laying upon open and stained
[36:29] with tears come in at midnight at night
[36:32] time where fathers and mothers was
[36:35] gathered together and their little
[36:36] children around on the floor kneeling
[36:39] around and father and mothers on their
[36:41] knees crying and praying I'd stand at
[36:44] the door and wait and wait and wait and
[36:48] they didn't stop praying I'll just sat
[36:50] down on the steps and sto praying myself
[36:53] waiting for them see and that was what
[36:57] the
[36:58] they loved one another they loved one
[37:01] another we used to stand and sing that
[37:04] old song blessed be the ties That Bind
[37:07] our hearts in Christian Love The
[37:09] Fellowship of Kindred mind is like to
[37:12] that above when we are sun apart it
[37:16] gives us inward pain but we shall still
[37:20] be joined in heart and hope to meet
[37:23] again I say this with great joy in my
[37:26] heart to Christ
[37:28] many of them are sleeping around in
[37:30] these Graves mocked tonight waiting for
[37:32] the great Resurrection where we'll meet
[37:35] together again let not that let not that
[37:40] Spirit ever depart from this
[37:45] place if it ever does that I don't care
[37:49] how elegant you your pastor might be how
[37:52] well he might bring the word of God the
[37:56] spirit of God is grieving the way see
[37:59] when we can have when we can have all
[38:02] things in Fellowship in common and love
[38:05] one another then God will work with us
[38:10] y'all hear what he saying it means it
[38:13] can be
[38:14] restored and and only then will God work
[38:18] through us when the love of God is
[38:21] restored between us and with us and this
[38:24] is why Satan always divide churches
[38:28] because he know A House Divided can't
[38:30] stand and and as long as there's sin in
[38:32] the camp people are hating and and and
[38:35] begrudging one another and you know you
[38:38] just foolishness childish things uh you
[38:41] know that's that's what Paul call it he
[38:44] call it he says listen when you ought to
[38:47] be on stake or the Deep things you you
[38:49] still got to be fed milk and it's
[38:51] because people are are failing to mature
[38:54] in Christ see I I say it like this the
[38:58] way it used to be can be
[39:03] again what do you want I mean what do
[39:05] you want and I understand through
[39:08] history the way Revival starts was that
[39:12] there were people dedicated enough to
[39:15] pray and fast until God came on the
[39:19] scene brother R said many of his
[39:21] meetings were successful because there
[39:24] were women behind the curtain praying
[39:26] for him
[39:28] see Prayer Changes Things and listen it
[39:32] it could start out one two or three but
[39:35] because the Bible said where two or
[39:36] three are gathered in my name there I am
[39:39] in the midst if we want a Revival in
[39:42] here it has to be more than just the
[39:45] pastor everybody that really want
[39:48] Revival need to understand is stars on
[39:52] your
[39:54] knees right let me read this a humble
[39:57] myself uh 1963 paragraph
[40:01] 99 and we're keeping
[40:04] time that the people come by and say if
[40:07] you want to see a church that's really
[40:10] humble a church really loves God drop in
[40:15] us there at the Tabernacle one time in
[40:18] the scripture where they had in the
[40:21] scripture where they had just left the
[40:24] Revival and Jesus was in the bottom of
[40:26] the boat sleep sleep and a storm came up
[40:30] and he brother Rand describ it he says
[40:32] while Jesus was asleep the disciples was
[40:35] on top on the boat testifying of the
[40:38] meeting that just came out of ain't that
[40:40] ain't that amazing for years we've been
[40:42] testifying about the meeting that was
[40:45] and now the storm is on us and we
[40:47] wondering where Jesus is he's still in
[40:50] the boat that's right right but then the
[40:53] the the the the the the intensity of the
[40:55] storm got him so to a PL brought him
[40:59] into a spirit of fear and they awake
[41:01] Jesus and that's what he wants he wants
[41:04] to be
[41:05] awakened he awake they awake Jesus and
[41:08] said carth thou not that we
[41:10] perish Jesus rebuked
[41:13] them ye of little of unbelief you just
[41:17] seen the
[41:18] miraculous right and the person who did
[41:20] it is right here in the
[41:22] ship but you still have you still
[41:26] disbelief
[41:28] when I've taught
[41:30] you that whatsoever come your way ask in
[41:33] my name and you shall receive it but you
[41:35] see they forgot all of that seem like
[41:37] people when the storms come they forgot
[41:39] forget who to look look to right yes
[41:44] then yes then they come look and see
[41:46] what time we're living you'll see the
[41:48] spirit of God moving among you great
[41:50] signs and wonders and things will be
[41:52] taking place if the thing is working
[41:54] together it's telling the time but if it
[41:58] isn't working then then time is
[42:02] stopped it won't tell the time no more
[42:06] so if y'all understand what he's saying
[42:08] a dead Church can't tell you the
[42:11] time you see a time we know that brother
[42:14] random talks about another outpouring of
[42:16] the Holy
[42:17] Ghost on the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[42:20] God knows we need it but when you find a
[42:23] church and they don't have those five
[42:25] identification of a true church
[42:27] you understand me something's
[42:30] wrong and I think what it is we don't
[42:33] love each other it boils right back down
[42:37] to loving one another because God works
[42:40] through the church in this age by way of
[42:45] love so if we want to know what time
[42:47] we're living just start everybody
[42:50] working together in the gospel loving
[42:52] one another loving God and the hands
[42:56] itself will tell the time what we're
[42:59] living in do you believe that sure amen
[43:02] the Lord bless you richly right why I
[43:06] believe the time will soon arrive this
[43:08] is coming from law having having a
[43:10] shadow I believe the time will soon
[43:13] arrived that when healing will be a Mir
[43:16] healing will be Miracles would Miracle
[43:20] heal Miracle healings with a such a
[43:24] common thing we we got to get some
[43:26] rapture ing faith in the church to go
[43:28] away from here on one of these days so
[43:32] he's equating or bringing these
[43:34] Supernatural elements into uh the time
[43:37] period of the Rapture without how are
[43:39] you going to make a Rapture if there's
[43:40] no healing and deliverances and things
[43:42] like that the Supernatural is not
[43:44] working among you no no no these things
[43:47] must be prevalent it is a sign of the
[43:50] time right you say I don't know about
[43:53] that yes it is on the day of Pentecost
[43:56] what did Peter quote
[43:59] Joel Joel to in the last day God said
[44:03] he' pour out his Spirit Upon Our flesh
[44:06] right they were the manifestation of
[44:08] Joel and we must have a manifestation of
[44:11] this message before we leave out of here
[44:14] with that can't not like it is and we
[44:18] know it's not going to be a vast
[44:19] majority but I'm coming back to John I
[44:22] love John John knew what love was all
[44:25] about and I John because John understood
[44:29] who Jesus was he laid in his bosom even
[44:32] though he was his brother he took
[44:33] advantage of it and I think that's what
[44:36] we need to do start laying in the bosom
[44:38] of Jesus he'll tell you Secrets John
[44:42] knew things nobody else
[44:44] knew
[44:45] right listen listen to this quote
[44:49] because I want to free somebody tonight
[44:52] coming from the message I'm sorry having
[44:54] a shadow brother bandam said like this
[44:57] paragraph 134 he said that's right I
[45:01] never was any good neither was you
[45:05] there's nothing we could do about it
[45:07] that's the good part of it but when you
[45:10] can just recognize that that you're no
[45:14] good then you not then you'll not trust
[45:17] in your own goodness if there's one
[45:20] thing you could do to Merit it you have
[45:23] something to brag about Lord I sought
[45:26] you day and night but you can't say that
[45:30] to
[45:31] him right so I'm going go on paragraph
[45:35] 136 he said no man come to me except my
[45:38] father draws him and God seeks man and
[45:42] not man seeking God so you don't have
[45:45] one thing to say but God it was your
[45:49] grace that did it and then as long as
[45:53] you accepted in the Beloved how can how
[45:57] how can God bring you into judgment and
[45:59] when he's already judged Christ in your
[46:02] stead perpetuation right atonement right
[46:07] when he already judged Christ in your
[46:09] stad how could you have suffered for
[46:12] your sins when Christ has already done
[46:14] it God will be a two-time and an offer
[46:19] person that's right if you had to suffer
[46:21] for your sins when it was thoroughly
[46:24] paid by Jesus Christ and you accepted it
[46:27] and as long as God accepted Christ he
[46:30] accepted you with Christ and when he did
[46:34] when when he did he do it before the
[46:37] foundation of the world when he spoke
[46:39] him into existence he spoke
[46:42] you you redem deemed with him and your
[46:47] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[46:49] Life before the foundation of the world
[46:52] then you're scared what oh if I could
[46:56] just keep holding on I quit that a long
[46:59] time ago I never did even try it in the
[47:02] first place I just turned loose and let
[47:06] him do the holding someone said when I
[47:09] was sick that time he said when I got
[47:11] over he said brother random did you keep
[47:14] your religion during this your sick
[47:16] spell I said no sir it kept me that's
[47:20] the difference and that's what happened
[47:23] see so a lot of time we think oh I'm
[47:25] holding on I'm keeping no no no no it's
[47:27] God who's keeping you it's God whose
[47:30] Grace save you God is The Keeper of the
[47:33] Soul think about how free you are and if
[47:37] you could see how free you are don't you
[47:39] wouldn't you want to see somebody else
[47:41] as free as you are the truth of the
[47:43] matter is the real gospel has not yet
[47:45] been
[47:47] preached every gospel amen is being
[47:50] preached according to a denominational
[47:53] Revelation but we have the true
[47:55] revelation of of what freedom is and
[47:59] that freedom was given to us by the love
[48:01] of God God so loved the world right so
[48:05] that same love is what God is wanting us
[48:08] to exemplify to our brothers to our
[48:11] sisters to our enemies right because he
[48:14] had a whole slew of enemies on the day
[48:17] he was
[48:19] crucified both Jews religious people
[48:22] Rome and everybody else and God says
[48:25] father forgive them amen for they know
[48:28] not what they do he didn't charge
[48:30] anybody right he forgave them
[48:33] all God wants us to be a friends
[48:38] friends and when he spoke that to my
[48:41] heart I says Lord show me some some kind
[48:44] of
[48:46] love uh between you know the the
[48:49] Believers you know I could see and
[48:51] understand you know we know you know
[48:54] Paul loved Timothy as his own son
[48:57] we know that but we see in the
[49:00] illustration there in Samuel 1 Samuel
[49:02] 18: 3-4 we see J Jonathan and David and
[49:06] we've heard that many times Jonathan and
[49:08] David made a covenant because he loved
[49:11] him as his own soul and I believe that
[49:14] was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:17] that we supposed to love one another as
[49:18] our own Souls but this is the thing that
[49:22] really impressed me and Jonathan
[49:25] stripped himself of the robe that was
[49:28] upon him and gave it to David and his
[49:31] garments even to his sword and to his
[49:35] bow and to his girdle so what was
[49:39] Jonathan doing Jonathan was really
[49:41] stripping himself he was making himself
[49:45] vulnerable right and true
[49:49] friends hide nothing from each
[49:53] other you're open because he's a friend
[49:58] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[50:01] by God's grace between
[50:03] Believers you believe the same thing and
[50:06] if you understand that story Jonathan
[50:09] even protected
[50:10] him against his own father
[50:14] Saul and even though David was being
[50:17] chased by Saul David still loved Saul
[50:20] and couldn't kill
[50:22] him and when he cut Saul's garment he
[50:25] went back in apoll oliz isin't that
[50:28] something because Saul didn't even
[50:30] recognize that David had cut His Garment
[50:33] David openly confess and that's what's
[50:35] happened to a lot of us sometime we cut
[50:38] people garment or we say things and we
[50:40] do things that we shouldn't do not
[50:42] knowing those curses flow right through
[50:45] the atmosphere and you're the only one
[50:47] that can stop it because you're the only
[50:49] one that started it but we do that but
[50:53] that's not
[50:55] love and we see how the Bible said
[50:58] loving a person and you know you get men
[51:01] they get all scared you know no this
[51:03] ain't I'm not talking about some kind of
[51:04] perverted thing I'm talking about a real
[51:07] love of God between brothers sisters
[51:10] have the same
[51:12] thing sisters do what about Ruth and
[51:17] Naomi mother-in-law and you know listen
[51:21] and they loved each other and and and
[51:25] I'm skipping because of my time but but
[51:28] but understand the relationship that
[51:30] that had David and Saul went went down
[51:32] in
[51:33] history went down in history and and you
[51:37] know we find out that they even made
[51:39] like I said made that Covenant you know
[51:41] and and and Jonathan and David work
[51:43] together to keep David safe from who
[51:47] Saul's jealousy conspiracy trying to
[51:50] kill
[51:51] David right you stand in the Gap you
[51:53] protect your can I say it like this
[51:57] Jonathan became David's
[51:59] Shield he came he protected him right we
[52:04] we don't even do that I mean but we
[52:06] should when somebody speak evil against
[52:09] somebody and you know that's wrong you
[52:10] need to stop and say stop that that's
[52:14] wrong stand up for what is Right stand
[52:16] up for what is truth even if it means
[52:18] that you lose a friend or or brother or
[52:21] sister but you're gain God you're gain
[52:24] the honor and you know the respect of
[52:27] God when you stand for the word but we
[52:31] we don't do that we should do
[52:35] it we should do it David loved Jonathan
[52:40] and Jonathan loved David so much to when
[52:43] David found out that Jonathan was
[52:45] killed David even went another
[52:49] measure and he took care of
[52:53] Jonathan's Afflicted son
[52:57] the FIV
[52:59] Chef think about it it was such a family
[53:03] affair it didn't just St with David it
[53:06] it was also with David's family you
[53:08] can't love me and not love my
[53:12] wife right when you love me you got to
[53:15] love my wife and my children it's a
[53:16] package deal that's the way it
[53:19] works that's the way it should Works
[53:25] work and God Is So PR precious God
[53:29] stripped
[53:30] himself just like
[53:32] Jonathan and gave it his his armor to
[53:38] us he became naked that we might be
[53:41] clothed that's what love does I mean
[53:45] love will do that just it doesn't seek
[53:47] its own when it came to Ruth and Naomi
[53:51] that came out of Ruth
[53:54] 116-117 Ruth said intreat me not y'all
[53:57] know the story to leave thee or to
[53:59] return from following after thee for
[54:02] whether thou goest I will go and whether
[54:05] thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people
[54:07] shall be my people and that God my God
[54:11] right let me go it like this there was
[54:15] no tribal in there's no W no fences
[54:19] there was no
[54:22] walls she
[54:24] became what Naomi was you understand me
[54:27] they became one people there was nothing
[54:30] to divide them this is the Bride of
[54:33] Jesus Christ there should be no culture
[54:36] no color no no no no rich or poor there
[54:39] should be nothing to divide us we
[54:42] supposed to be
[54:44] one that's what love does that's what
[54:46] it'll
[54:47] do brother r t
[54:51] uh how is that a a man with Cur pans on
[54:54] should be able to hug a tuck seat or a
[54:56] man with a tuck seat and call him
[54:57] brother however he says that but that's
[55:00] the way it's supposed to be there's no
[55:02] greater big eyes and little use we're
[55:05] all one family of one blood if you can't
[55:10] do this in the name of Jesus Christ you
[55:12] like the love of God and let me say it
[55:15] like this you can't practice this this
[55:19] only comes by the change of your nature
[55:22] which is God in you it's no longer you
[55:25] working anymore is a holy ghost living
[55:27] his life through you and that's what we
[55:30] all
[55:31] need where thou dest will I die and
[55:35] there will I
[55:37] be buried the Lord do so me do so to me
[55:41] and more also it all if ought but death
[55:46] part thee and me oh my it almost sound
[55:49] like a wedding
[55:51] ceremony what were they doing pledging
[55:54] she was pledging her Allegiance to her
[55:57] mother-in-law as we do to the
[56:00] word we pledge our allegiance to the
[56:03] word that that good old way that old
[56:06] time way and we LED that way because it
[56:10] was that way that brought us out of
[56:12] Moab that way that brought us to
[56:16] Jerusalem you understand me so I I'll
[56:19] say it like this John you know he going
[56:22] to talk about love because John you
[56:24] think about he was the only disciples
[56:26] that didn't
[56:28] run when they came after
[56:31] Jesus he was the only disciples that
[56:34] stayed with Jesus all the other
[56:39] scattered John types the
[56:42] bride Under Pressure she stayed with
[56:45] Jesus under re ridicule she stayed with
[56:49] Jesus under the crucifixion she stays
[56:52] with Jesus she loved Jesus like John
[56:57] loved Jesus and you and I must
[57:00] understand that this love that we have
[57:03] is not for me and mine it's for
[57:06] everybody even the stranger that you
[57:08] don't
[57:10] know God is
[57:12] love and if you love your
[57:14] brother then you have the love of God in
[57:18] you and I'mma re re say say this again
[57:22] I'm not talking about filo love because
[57:24] filio love will quit on
[57:27] you love divine never
[57:31] faileth it never fails and I don't know
[57:35] about you just studying this chapter on
[57:37] John I'm like Lord I
[57:39] need I need that Divine love to be on
[57:43] display I believe God has worked me with
[57:46] a lot of Virtues but I want the
[57:49] fullness I want that love that never
[57:52] fails I want that love that's greater
[57:55] than faith hope
[57:57] right faith hope and charity but the
[58:00] greatest of these is
[58:02] Charity faith hope and love so the
[58:05] greatest of it all is love and I I I
[58:07] want this to no matter what if it takes
[58:09] my whatever death I must take and when I
[58:12] say that I mean naturally dying to
[58:14] whatever I need to die to God is my
[58:16] witness he hear me declaring this I have
[58:20] one
[58:20] focus and that is to please God in this
[58:23] day to come out at the end
[58:26] where he can say Well done my good and
[58:29] faithful servant and in closing for the
[58:32] lessons today if you could remember that
[58:35] all God asked you to do is to be
[58:38] obedient because he's taking care of all
[58:40] of the other things he's washed you he's
[58:44] Sanctified you he's freed you there's no
[58:47] judgment against you I mean what more
[58:50] can he do and all he asked for is that
[58:53] you have you love him he saids if you
[58:55] love me you'll keep my
[58:57] commandment let's
[59:04] stand we seem like it's a million miles
[59:07] away but it's not it's so close all you
[59:09] got to do is drop to your
[59:11] knees a lot of people don't want to
[59:13] Humble you got to humble yourself to get
[59:15] this you got to pray even when you don't
[59:17] feel like praying you might not even
[59:20] feel him but he knows you on your knees
[59:22] it's not like God said well I don't hear
[59:24] him I don't feel him no no no God sees
[59:26] you what inspired you to get on your
[59:28] knees is not the
[59:31] devil because the devil know that's a
[59:34] position that is a dangerous position
[59:36] for him when it comes to the Saints
[59:39] brother bam talks about it he said the
[59:41] weakest of All Saints make a devil
[59:43] tremble when they go down to pray so
[59:46] remember no matter how weak you feel the
[59:49] solution to your Victory is through
[59:52] prayer I don't care whether you feel it
[59:55] or not
[59:56] talk to Jesus and God will respond let's
[1:00:00] have a word of prayer father God we
[1:00:01] thank you for your grace your mercy we
[1:00:04] thank you for being so good to us you
[1:00:07] have been better to us than we've been
[1:00:08] to ourselves I trust this little lesson
[1:00:10] has been a blessing to the people of God
[1:00:13] lord as we move through the scriptures
[1:00:15] Lord uh being Inspire inspired by you
[1:00:19] and I'm just trying to relate to the
[1:00:21] people what you have given to me and I
[1:00:24] pray right now Lord God that somehow the
[1:00:27] words tonight will find good ground and
[1:00:29] bring forth 100 fold because brother
[1:00:32] Lord you said if we hate our brother we
[1:00:36] are liars and we know not the truth the
[1:00:41] only way we can be in
[1:00:43] you and you in US is that we have love
[1:00:47] one toward another thank you Father God
[1:00:51] for the reading of your word in Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ's name we pray amen amen you're
[1:00:57] dismissed
