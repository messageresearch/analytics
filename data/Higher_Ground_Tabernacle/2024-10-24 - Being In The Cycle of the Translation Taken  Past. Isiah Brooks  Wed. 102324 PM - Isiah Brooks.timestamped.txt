[0:24] [Music]
[0:28] resp
[0:43] let us pray our gracious father God we
[0:46] thank you for your
[0:47] grace we thank you for your
[0:50] mercy and all that you have done for us
[0:54] Lord we pray tonight that the word of
[0:57] God will find an anchor in our
[1:00] Souls Lord that it would continue to
[1:03] create in us the very virtue and divine
[1:08] nature of Christ Lord we here oh God in
[1:13] the Judgment house in the house where
[1:16] judgment began and father we want you
[1:19] tonight to look in the depths of our
[1:22] soul there be anything within us that is
[1:25] not right or proper any Speck of
[1:28] Darkness we pray tonight Hallelujah Lord
[1:32] that you forgive us and cleanse us from
[1:35] all
[1:36] unrighteousness and to you be all the
[1:38] glory in Jesus Christ name we
[1:41] pray amen amen uh you may be
[1:45] seated I I just want to
[1:49] um draw a subject
[1:53] tonight being we we spoke on the Rapture
[1:56] I think the last when we dealt with Jude
[2:01] and and
[2:02] tonight we want to just kind of move in
[2:05] another
[2:08] segment not in just the book of Jude but
[2:11] I believe that this is the hour that we
[2:14] are to be
[2:17] translated uh we're we're not in the
[2:19] seven Church
[2:22] ages in that in that sense brother Bram
[2:26] said every Church age overlapped one
[2:28] another
[2:34] but we know by the grace of
[2:36] God that in the church
[2:39] ages starting from
[2:42] Ephesus there was always
[2:44] something uh the spirit of the Lord had
[2:47] against
[2:50] them and then and then when it came to
[2:52] Le out
[2:54] OFA she was in the worst shape of them
[2:56] all
[3:00] in
[3:01] Leia we heard a voice that told us that
[3:06] we were living in Satan's
[3:10] Eden and but in the same
[3:13] token took the the the the the darkest
[3:18] age to produce the brightest
[3:21] [Music]
[3:22] light and you and I must
[3:26] understand amen that our in the bride
[3:29] age
[3:31] there is nothing said against
[3:36] you is that right so I want you to
[3:40] understand this is the grace of
[3:43] God no man has been
[3:47] able to accomplish the Holiness of
[3:52] God even when the laws were
[3:55] given none can keep the law
[4:00] so brother Bram said God had to find a
[4:05] way or produce a
[4:07] way in order for us to be
[4:10] saved so in this
[4:13] age we call the bride
[4:16] Age The Covenant which God has given
[4:18] unto
[4:19] us is
[4:23] unconditional amen it's not what you can
[4:25] do for
[4:26] him it's what God has already done for
[4:29] you
[4:30] hallelujah hallelujah he was so
[4:33] certain of those of us who would make it
[4:36] through this
[4:38] age that he put our
[4:41] names in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[4:44] the foundation of the
[4:46] world Hallelujah huj I'm so glad
[4:50] tonight be in that
[4:53] number Hallelujah many people are
[4:57] saying when the Rapture takes
[5:00] place I want to be in it but I want you
[5:03] to understand the Rapture is already in
[5:08] progress Hallelujah huj and I'm so glad
[5:12] to be a part of this
[5:14] Rapture understand me when I
[5:18] falter when I come
[5:20] short I I know God is
[5:23] already made a way for me to
[5:27] escape I understand this
[5:31] that I can never be
[5:33] accepted on my own
[5:35] merits but I am
[5:38] accepted you are
[5:40] accepted in the
[5:42] Beloved now this ought to fir people
[5:46] up we should never be
[5:50] lukewarm with a message like
[5:53] this hallelujah hallelujah thank God for
[5:57] his Amazing Grace
[6:00] this
[6:01] AG this age is the age of
[6:06] insanity but it's also a
[6:09] age for the
[6:11] same for the
[6:13] same there are only a few of
[6:17] us and the prophet of God said the
[6:20] bride will be the only one in this
[6:24] age that has her right
[6:27] mind Hallelujah and the only why
[6:31] reason we have our our right
[6:35] mind is because the mind of
[6:38] Christ has been given to
[6:42] us is that right see the bride is only
[6:45] sane
[6:47] people in the
[6:51] world I did not say those that follow
[6:56] this
[6:57] message all are all in their right
[7:02] mind many are
[7:04] not as it always have
[7:07] been throughout the age of
[7:11] time Hallelujah there are
[7:14] those who has the ear to
[7:17] hear and there are those who cannot
[7:22] hear hallelujah hallelujah so you
[7:26] understand it is the serpent
[7:29] they cannot
[7:31] hear Hallelujah he has no ears per
[7:35] se he only knows his
[7:39] surroundings by
[7:42] vibrations
[7:44] Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus
[7:47] Christ she hears the
[7:50] word she hears the voice of
[7:53] God so much so Jesus said my sheep
[7:59] my voice and a
[8:01] stranger they will not
[8:04] follow this is also the
[8:07] age of the great falling of every
[8:13] system whether it be
[8:16] political
[8:18] social or whether it is
[8:21] religious Everything Must
[8:24] Fall is that right the only uh how can I
[8:29] said the only
[8:32] house or the only
[8:35] Kingdom that cannot fall it's the
[8:38] kingdom that is founded upon the
[8:42] rock
[8:43] hallelujah is that right I'm coming to
[8:46] something in just a moment this is the
[8:49] age of the manifestation of the wheat
[8:52] and
[8:54] tear I was thinking about this on
[8:57] yesterday I said you and and I know we
[9:00] got two
[9:02] pools you got a pool for
[9:04] heaven and there's a pool for
[9:07] hell is that right and it all depends on
[9:11] which pull
[9:12] you yield yourself
[9:15] to Hallelujah is that right many of us
[9:19] don't want to believe that we have
[9:22] periods where we worship
[9:27] Satan when you step out side of the
[9:31] word you begin to yield your members
[9:35] to
[9:37] Hallelujah
[9:39] Satan when you in the word when you
[9:42] under the word you yeld to the Holy
[9:46] Spirit and that is
[9:48] God hallelujah hallelujah this is the
[9:52] age the manifestation of the wheat and
[9:54] tear as I
[9:56] said this is the age of the serpent seed
[10:01] as well as the manifestations of the
[10:03] sons of
[10:05] God hallelujah now I want you to
[10:08] understand that the grace of God is
[10:11] always with his
[10:13] seed
[10:15] understand I want to I want to really
[10:17] push this uh so you can
[10:21] understand none of us are worthy to
[10:26] stand is that right I'm I'm recalled of
[10:30] how
[10:33] Isaiah in the year that King oziah
[10:40] died I saw the
[10:42] Lord he was
[10:44] high and lifted
[10:47] up and in that
[10:51] Vision Isaiah
[10:53] saw not only
[10:55] himself but the condition of the people
[10:59] Hallelujah he said oh woe is me I am a
[11:03] man of unclean
[11:05] lips and I DW among the people
[11:09] hallelujah of unclean
[11:11] lips in other words in order to go up
[11:16] you must first come
[11:18] down Hallelujah huj I don't care who you
[11:21] think you
[11:23] are every seed of God must humble
[11:27] themselves in order to go
[11:30] up hallelujah hallelujah this is also
[11:34] the age of the ending of the Gentile
[11:38] age when the door is shut to this age of
[11:42] the
[11:43] seven y'all hear what I'm saying this is
[11:46] the age of the
[11:49] closing is that right I'm going say that
[11:52] again you are now living in the time
[11:56] when the Gentile age is closing
[12:01] Hallelujah and if that be the
[12:03] case which side of the door are you
[12:08] on hallelujah hallelujah you are the
[12:11] inside or you on the
[12:14] outside hallelujah hallelujah but think
[12:18] about it God said he never lost
[12:22] one hallelujah amen and we
[12:26] understand that the opening of The Seven
[12:28] seal
[12:30] is the mystery of the coming of the
[12:33] Lord hallelujah is that right brother
[12:37] brandham says it's
[12:39] Christ so you and I must
[12:42] understand Hallelujah that God is among
[12:45] us even to this
[12:48] day a lot of times people think that God
[12:51] is with
[12:52] them only when they come to
[12:56] church but I want you to understand God
[12:58] is always always with
[13:01] you you may not recognize it but he's
[13:06] always
[13:08] there Hallelujah is that right now
[13:12] listen when Adam and Eve
[13:15] sin it may appear that God wasn't there
[13:20] but God was always
[13:22] there he didn't say uhoh what has
[13:26] happened to my son he knew the plan from
[13:29] the beginning to the
[13:31] end
[13:33] Hallelujah this is the part that I like
[13:36] so when he
[13:39] confronted Adam and Eve he basically
[13:44] said who told you you was
[13:47] naked he didn't say what did you read a
[13:52] book Hallelujah but who showing that it
[13:57] was a person
[13:59] that showed them that they were
[14:02] naked see that goes with the serpent
[14:05] seed a creature that look so much like a
[14:09] man he was able to talk like a man he
[14:12] was able to mix the seed of a
[14:14] [Music]
[14:16] man he was the one that Satan
[14:21] used to take the clothes
[14:25] off of Adam and Eve
[14:29] hallelujah hallelujah now Adam stayed
[14:31] with
[14:33] her because he loved
[14:35] her is that right coming from the
[14:40] message I'll read that
[14:43] again God is so good to
[14:45] us
[14:47] hallelujah
[14:50] listen let's just read it
[14:53] again coming from the
[14:56] exposition now I know in answering one
[14:58] question I'm coming to
[15:05] something one is apt to come up and
[15:07] people ask
[15:10] me if Eve fell that
[15:13] way what did Adam
[15:16] do now you know brother bam said Adam
[15:20] was a type of
[15:22] Christ he
[15:25] knew she was
[15:27] wrong and he knew the
[15:32] consequences you know that he would
[15:35] plunge
[15:38] mankind into
[15:40] sin he knew
[15:42] that that that this was not the perfect
[15:46] will of
[15:47] God but he loved her so
[15:51] [Music]
[15:53] much I love this because Adam loved I
[15:58] love to say like this Adam broke the
[16:03] word that means Adam loved
[16:07] Eve more than he loved
[16:11] God think about
[16:15] it that's what it
[16:17] was but he was in the plan of
[16:21] [Music]
[16:22] God and he was the only one that God
[16:26] could show us
[16:30] how much he loved
[16:34] us amen hallelujah hallel you think
[16:37] about it a god of
[16:41] Holiness never un never experiencing
[16:47] pain but he fashioned himself like a
[16:51] man hear what I'm saying he wanted to
[16:54] feel what it felt like to have a
[16:56] headache
[16:58] wanted to feel but it felt to be
[17:03] sick understand me this is why Hebrew
[17:07] says that we have
[17:09] one a
[17:11] comforter hallelujah amen that could
[17:14] feel our
[17:16] infirmities he knows all about it
[17:20] Hallelujah the Bible said he became
[17:24] sin that we might become the
[17:26] righteousness of God
[17:29] you understand what I'm saying how on
[17:31] Earth are you going to make a
[17:34] Rapture hallelujah it's not by power
[17:39] it's not by mind but it's by the spirit
[17:42] of
[17:43] God hallelujah hallelujah you must have
[17:46] this
[17:48] mindset because in your natural
[17:52] mind this is
[17:55] impossible hallelujah hallelujah in your
[17:58] natural
[18:00] mind how many of you can
[18:02] say I live holy all
[18:06] day hallelujah oh come on
[18:10] somebody but with his
[18:14] stripes we were
[18:17] healed hallelujah hallelujah I must put
[18:20] it all back on
[18:22] God way you going to make a
[18:27] Rapture take
[18:30] message your mind with the
[18:33] message away the
[18:35] fears wash away the
[18:38] concerns Hallelujah you must wash your
[18:43] mind such a way that you a to stand
[18:48] before
[18:49] God lord it's all because of your mercy
[18:54] and Grace
[18:59] hallelujah hallelujah you know I'm
[19:04] glad that God says he loves the
[19:11] backslider because we all backslide
[19:13] every
[19:15] day somebody help me
[19:18] here God loves
[19:20] us even though he
[19:23] knows every failure you going to make
[19:28] say like this you can have
[19:32] children and they can make all kind of
[19:35] mistakes nothing can cancel
[19:39] out their
[19:42] relationship with you a son is a son and
[19:46] a daughter is a
[19:48] daughter hallelujah hallelujah no matter
[19:52] how bad it
[19:54] gets God said I'll never leave you no
[19:58] will I forsake
[20:00] you hallelujah hallelujah now the Lord
[20:03] has always called for toal
[20:07] separation from all
[20:10] unbelief Hallelujah is that right you
[20:14] see even from the
[20:16] beginning when Adam and Eve
[20:19] fell God separated the
[20:22] two not Adam and Eve but he separated
[20:25] the two
[20:27] seeds Hallelujah
[20:29] y'all remember Cain killed
[20:31] Abel Hallelujah and in the process of
[20:34] all of that God God
[20:38] separated Cain from the righteous
[20:42] seed is that right so you say what do
[20:45] you
[20:46] mean God has
[20:49] always found his
[20:51] seed no matter where they were
[20:58] right you said well what do you mean
[21:00] brother Brooks just for an example here
[21:03] was a Ethiopian
[21:05] unic who did not know nothing about
[21:08] Christ and him being
[21:10] crucified somebody help me here but he
[21:13] was the seed of
[21:14] God he was on a
[21:17] mission he was a
[21:19] servant Hallelujah hallelu but there he
[21:22] was he had a pool of God and God met him
[21:29] y'all hear what I'm saying there was a
[21:32] woman Hallelujah in
[21:35] Jericho hallelujah hallelujah she was a
[21:38] seed of God and though she was in a
[21:42] place that was
[21:46] ungodly and though she was
[21:49] affected by the influence of that
[21:53] City God knew that
[21:57] inside there's a seed germ
[22:01] hallelu and God went down there in
[22:06] Jero destroyed the whole
[22:09] city just to get
[22:15] her what are you talking about brother
[22:18] God will tear up
[22:20] everything
[22:23] justify y'all hear what I'm
[22:25] saying it's nothing but the truth God
[22:28] don't care what system you might be
[22:31] in y y'all hear what I'm saying God
[22:34] don't care if the church done through
[22:36] you out God don't care if you look like
[22:39] you're
[22:41] unsavable somebody help me
[22:43] here as I said to myself and I've said
[22:47] to you many of times God will take the
[22:51] devil and the devil will bring you to
[22:55] Jesus is that right when woman was C in
[23:00] adultery somebody help me here it was
[23:04] those Pharisees and
[23:06] saddu brought to
[23:09] Jesus it he shook their
[23:13] system their system
[23:16] up they tried to bring the word tried
[23:20] bring the system to the
[23:24] word that the word is God hallelujah
[23:29] they brought her to the Judgment
[23:32] seat somebody help me here but they fail
[23:36] the
[23:37] SE in that
[23:40] seed in that woman rather she look like
[23:43] a eame
[23:48] woman wastified
[23:51] is that right because he
[23:56] asked that without sin
[23:59] let him cast the first
[24:01] stone and
[24:03] everybody who shall lay in charge to
[24:06] God's
[24:09] electus amen and what happened there
[24:14] Hallelujah Jesus said woman where are
[24:18] your
[24:19] accusers Hallelujah is that right where
[24:22] are your
[24:24] accusers amen amen she said I have none
[24:29] Isaiah 54 said
[24:32] what oh my God God is so good to
[24:36] us you and I must
[24:39] understand that God knows how to
[24:43] deliver the
[24:46] righteous Hallelujah he knows how to
[24:49] deliver his
[24:52] seed even after the
[24:55] flood there was a man that was called
[24:57] nimr
[25:00] and Nimrod was a
[25:03] spirit he was
[25:06] anointed uh by Lucifer
[25:09] himself and that Spirit still
[25:12] lives that's right he was a man of
[25:17] war he believed in conquering
[25:20] people and bringing
[25:23] into a
[25:25] Unity Hallelujah H come on somebody the
[25:29] Bible tells us that this man was
[25:34] achieving everything he sought out to
[25:38] achieve and I'm going to tell you
[25:40] something God would the devil would
[25:42] achieve with
[25:44] you everything that he sought out to
[25:48] achieve if God didn't
[25:51] intervene come on somebody and he was
[25:54] building a
[25:55] kingdom it was a big a great Kingdom
[25:59] and and and listen God said let me go
[26:03] down because if I'm not if I let them
[26:07] continue and this is what I love about
[26:09] this if the devil can
[26:12] unite and get the attention of
[26:15] God what about the Bride of Jesus
[26:19] Christ hallelujah hallelujah if if the
[26:23] devil can
[26:25] unite against God what about the
[26:31] bride and stand against the
[26:34] devil hallelujah hallelujah it was a
[26:37] time that man wanted
[26:39] Glory sound familiar Hallelujah this is
[26:43] also a time that science and
[26:48] inventions were so high Hallelujah nrod
[26:52] took
[26:53] himself to be a
[26:57] god y'all better hear what I'm saying
[26:59] you wait wait a minute brother I kind of
[27:02] heard this before but you better listen
[27:05] to me now because the spirit of nimrod
[27:08] is still working
[27:11] today hallah he's controlling the People
[27:15] by
[27:16] force say oh brother what are you
[27:18] talking about he's got a new
[27:21] tactic but he he controls your
[27:25] mind in a time that the of God says that
[27:30] the greatest battle ever
[27:33] fought in your
[27:35] mind Hallelujah so the devil he
[27:39] literally controls your
[27:41] mind he gets your mind and he's molding
[27:44] it and making
[27:46] it I'm talking about those who listen to
[27:50] all of the
[27:51] media follow all of the
[27:54] stories you do all of that kind of thing
[27:58] fail to see that's the spirit of nimrod
[28:02] because everything out there is
[28:04] glorifying the
[28:06] devil Hallelujah everything out there is
[28:11] glorifying the devil Hallelujah and when
[28:14] you enact allow
[28:17] yourself to be a part of it you fail to
[28:22] see even the prophet of God says one day
[28:27] you receive rece a
[28:32] blast oh you say what do I mean what do
[28:35] you mean
[28:36] brother even your video
[28:38] games is a very dangerous
[28:42] thing you are opening your
[28:44] mind up to The Fifth
[28:47] Dimension where demons
[28:50] travel hallelujah hallelujah you fail to
[28:53] see the influence of the enemy like I
[28:57] said two
[28:58] influences one is to take you up and the
[29:02] other one is to take you down Hallelujah
[29:05] but I want you to understand that the
[29:08] system of
[29:09] nimrod Hallelujah was
[29:12] destroyed God came down hallelujah
[29:16] hallelujah and divided the people
[29:19] hallelujah is that right but there's
[29:22] another system there was a man by the
[29:25] name of uh of Abraham
[29:28] but let me let me read a little bit of
[29:30] little bit of history on this
[29:32] Nimrod it says during the time of
[29:35] nimrod Babylonian
[29:37] King the following events are said to
[29:40] have
[29:41] occurred I want you to take this in mind
[29:45] I'm not sure where they got all of their
[29:46] information
[29:47] from but we do know that he was a
[29:50] warrior he was a great
[29:53] hunter because during that time men
[29:55] began to eat meat
[29:58] before the FL they didn't eat meat but
[30:02] after the flood they were allowed to eat
[30:06] meat so he was a great
[30:09] Hunter and I want you to understand now
[30:12] the spirit of nimrod is still a great
[30:15] hunter but he's hunting
[30:18] Souls
[30:19] Hallelujah that he may destroy that he
[30:23] may conquer that he may control
[30:28] Rod is considered to have led the
[30:31] construction of the tow of Babel in the
[30:34] land of
[30:37] Shah the Bible does not explicitly say
[30:41] this Hallelujah is that right Nimrod
[30:45] established the first
[30:47] Kingdom the of
[30:52] Babel and akad in the land of
[30:56] sha he also built cities
[31:00] inria including
[31:03] Neva
[31:04] K
[31:06] reob and
[31:08] re hallelujah hallelujah is Right Nimrod
[31:13] conquered and subjugated the
[31:15] people other
[31:17] land forming an
[31:20] Empire and whether you realize it or not
[31:24] the spirit of nimrod is doing the same
[31:26] thing
[31:28] Hallelujah call it the United Nations
[31:31] calling you to the World Council of
[31:33] churches these these people are
[31:37] 19 against God y'all better hear what
[31:40] I'm saying because with the system comes
[31:45] persecution comes War and the and and
[31:49] and the the the the the um the
[31:52] drive of this
[31:55] system is to conquer everyone
[32:00] believes in
[32:04] God
[32:06] hallelujah Nimrod incited
[32:11] people to attribute their
[32:14] prosperity to their own Veil rather than
[32:17] to God is that right you see the
[32:22] churches under that
[32:25] inspiration robing the people Tak
[32:28] Advantage oh come on somebody it ain't
[32:31] just the Catholic church it's all of
[32:33] them Hallelujah and what the people are
[32:36] not
[32:37] seeing is that the system that they're
[32:40] under is not God let me say like this
[32:45] the prophet of God through his ministry
[32:48] brought us the proper way to worship God
[32:52] and if you don't worship God under that
[32:56] expression hallelu you're not worshiping
[33:00] God because in order to worship God you
[33:03] must worship Him in spirit in
[33:07] truth hallelujah a lot of people might
[33:10] be afraid to say that I'm Not Afraid say
[33:14] it because I realize what I'm working
[33:18] against or working
[33:21] with Hallelujah you say oh no brother
[33:24] Brook oh you haven't seen nothing yet I
[33:28] trust by the grace of God that each and
[33:30] every one of us make a

[33:35] cycle of
[33:37] translation because I want you to
[33:39] understand you just can't live any kind
[33:42] of way and say I'm in the
[33:44] Rapture

[34:12] down until you humble
[34:15] yourself Hallelujah is that

[42:21] Holy
[42:23] Ghost I'm not saying you ain't got a
[42:25] measure of it
[42:28] we need enough Holy
[42:31] Ghost to bring
[42:33] God in a place in our life where he have
[42:37] total
[42:39] preeminence Hallelujah that's what the
[42:42] message came for so that God could have
[42:45] total
[42:47] preeminence
[42:49] what God told
[42:51] Abraham go sacrifice
[42:55] ISAC right
[42:57] that was his final
[42:59] test he had failed along the line you
[43:03] know go and he go west God go west he go
[43:08] east y understand me always getting in
[43:11] trouble but God took that Treasure of
[43:14] his

[43:29] him he's right there to bless you he
[43:33] said to

[43:43] him Hallelujah you love the
[43:46] Lord Hebrews 11 8
[43:52] through1 Hallelujah I'll try to finish
[43:55] this up on Sunday
[43:57] [Music]
[44:00] this is just the
[44:02] beginning by
[44:04] faith eth verse by faith Abraham when he
[44:08] was called to go out into a
[44:11] place which he should afterward receive
[44:13] an
[44:14] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[44:18] knowing whether he went does that sound
[44:21] for me the scripture says you have not
[44:24] traveled this way before
[44:27] Hallelujah but you got to keep
[44:30] going Hallelujah Hallelujah by faith he
[44:34] saw Jour in the land of
[44:36] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[44:40] in Tabernacles with ISAC and Jacob the
[44:43] airs with him of the same
[44:45] promise I love that but he looked for a
[44:49] Hallelujah he look for a city which have
[44:54] Foundation whose Builder and maker is of
[44:56] God
[45:00] you understand me though Faith also
[45:03] through faith also Sarah
[45:06] herself received strength to conceive
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] seed and was delivered of a
[45:14] child when she was past
[45:19] age Hallelujah why because she judged
[45:24] him faithful
[45:27] who had
[45:29] promised
[45:30] Hallelujah I don't know about you I
[45:34] judge him
[45:35] faithful hallelu he made the
[45:39] promise and he that begun that good
[45:41] promise in
[45:44] you Hallelujah you say oh brother let me
[45:49] tell you something we are so
[45:52] blessed Abraham had no Scrolls to look
[45:55] at
[45:57] there was no
[45:59] book and he here he was in a place of
[46:03] idolatry y'all hear what I'm saying he
[46:05] was in
[46:06] Babylon Hallelujah and God calls him out
[46:11] and he was able to hear the voice of God
[46:16] and because of that he was led by The
[46:21] Voice
[46:23] soundar Hallelujah God in his in time
[46:28] has given us his
[46:31] Voice Hallelujah and those who can hear
[46:35] the
[46:36] voice Follow The
[46:39] Voice Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to

[46:51] 028 paragraph
[46:54] 53 you love the Lord
[46:58] here the
[47:00] seed one one
[47:02] seed Not
[47:04] seeds but one
[47:07] seed these others were not Seed of
[47:11] Abraham because Abraham seed was his
[47:14] faith
[47:16] seed that God was speaking of not his
[47:20] natural seed because after Sarah
[47:25] died Abraham married another woman and
[47:29] had seven sons besides
[47:33] daughters so it wouldn't be Abraham's
[47:37] seeds it was Abraham's
[47:41] seed and that was Abraham's Faith
[47:44] seed you understand what he's
[47:47] saying Faith seed a
[47:51] revelation of who you
[47:54] are hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody
[47:57] help me here listen Faith
[48:01] seed pointing to the Royal
[48:04] seed
[48:07] that that was to come through Abraham's
[48:11] faith not Abraham's natural life but
[48:15] Abraham's spiritual life who took
[48:18] everything contrary to God's
[48:22] word and call it as though it was not
[48:27] believed God against
[48:30] hope believed in hope that the real
[48:35] seed that's the real seed we're speaking
[48:38] of how you going to make a Rapture
[48:41] without
[48:42] faith and that faith is a
[48:45] revelation and that Revelation is that
[48:47] God chose you before the foundation of
[48:50] the
[48:51] world not by power not by might but by
[48:55] my spirit
[48:57] that SC that scripture because I
[49:01] realize I didn't make
[49:04] me make
[49:06] you God Made
[49:09] You hallelujah

[49:16] mistake by putting Rahab and

[49:27] had traveled from
[49:30] Egypt to the promised land in those
[49:32] seven days of

[49:41] wait so he caused him to wander in the
[49:45] wilderness let me tell yall let me say
[49:48] y this
[49:50] Rapture this Rapture this this
[49:53] translation could have happened a long
[49:56] time ago

[50:07] people for
[50:09] me for

[50:14] and

[50:19] generation

[50:24] in a Rahab yes you are the Bible call
[50:27] this an adulterous
[50:36] generation and God knew what he was
[50:40] doing had he not placed the seed in

[50:46] become like Sodom and
[50:50] gomorra I hate it when people like they
[50:52] all righteous and

[52:47] God are you in that
[52:52] cycle you know the Bible says the joy of
[52:55] the Lord is your strength
[52:58] and sometimes we act like a Baptist
[53:03] Church brother brother Josh y'all don't
[53:07] know what he been
[53:08] through you don't know where he's come
[53:10] from that's why you see all that Joy

[53:17] craning your neck like what is
[53:19] that Joy that's what y'all used to have
[53:29] come on somebody he ain't out of order

[53:56] something God always drawing us out of
[53:59] the waters you know Waters represent
[54:00] people you know he always draws us

[54:08] system like Egypt but God even in that

[56:40] Pharaoh's
[56:42] daughter hallelujah hallelujah choosing
[56:45] rather to suffer
[56:48] afflictions with the people of God than

[57:27] revelation of who you
[57:29] are has been revealed to you that you
[57:32] are the bride of Christ your every move
[57:35] every day is to do the will of
[57:39] God esteeming the reproach of
[57:42] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[57:44] of
[57:47] Egypt and how many when the last you've
[57:52] been
[57:53] persecuted for being a Christian
[57:56] standing on the word of for the
[57:58] hour Hallelujah calling you a cult and

[58:12] cult cuz that's what they say that's the
[58:15] definition of
[58:16] one Hallelujah but the greatest cult
[58:20] ever is the Roman Catholic
[58:23] Church W you better not say that too
[58:25] loud
[58:27] but they follow a
[58:28] man they don't even follow the word no
[58:32] more and that's how oh come on somebody
[58:36] esteeming the reproach of Greater Christ
[58:38] greater riches than the treasures of
[58:41] Egypt for he had respect unto recompense
[58:45] of the
[58:49] reward you love the Lord I'm going say
[58:53] this again the spirit to
[58:57] conquer and to unify against
[59:01] God is still that Spirit of
[59:04] Babylon to teach false
[59:07] doctrines and lies to manipulate the
[59:12] people it's the spirit of
[59:15] Babylon one world
[59:19] order uniting of
[59:21] churches as the bride of Christ
[59:26] is the spirit of
[59:28] Babylon the entire Babylonian
[59:31] system system
[59:33] of the mother and the child the god the
[59:38] Trinity of Father Son and Holy
[59:40] Ghost and and what we don't we treat it
[59:44] as if it's
[59:46] nothing in one of these old
[59:49] days coming soon you're going to see
[59:54] that thing is a liive
[59:57] and well and God describ it as a woman
[1:00:00] riding a
[1:00:03] beast and the Bible said all of the
[1:00:06] blood of the martyrs what martys those
[1:00:10] who were
[1:00:12] Christians all of the
[1:00:14] blood is in her Revelation 17 1-8 like I
[1:00:20] said I'm just starting out I'll move
[1:00:22] forward and
[1:00:27] Sunday by God's
[1:00:31] gra Revelation
[1:00:36] 1718 and there came one of the Seven
[1:00:39] Angels which had seven vials and talk
[1:00:42] with me saying unto me come hither I
[1:00:45] will show unto thee the Judgment of the
[1:00:47] great that sth upon my many Waters
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:59] y'all remember when y'all first came to
[1:01:01] the
[1:01:02] message the scriptures were
[1:01:05] powerful we knew at at at any
[1:01:10] time this church was going to raise up
[1:01:12] and come after us and it's been a long
[1:01:16] time
[1:01:18] coming but it's
[1:01:21] here I I know some things that I can't
[1:01:23] say right now but it's here
[1:01:27] and whether you see it or
[1:01:29] not this Spirit infiltrates every
[1:01:35] church that is a
[1:01:38] system that has no Holy Ghost you
[1:01:41] understand me but a church with the Holy
[1:01:46] Ghost be a we you be you're
[1:01:49] able to see the enemy a far
[1:01:53] off hallelujah hallelujah with whom the
[1:01:56] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:02:00] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[1:02:02] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[1:02:06] of her
[1:02:14] fornication how can I say it if you
[1:02:17] can't see that the world is
[1:02:20] drunk out of their mind
[1:02:26] these people are fighting
[1:02:28] God hallelujah hallelujah and the war
[1:02:33] has not escalated
[1:02:37] yet you let me say it like
[1:02:40] this talk about
[1:02:43] Ukraine what's the spirit behind
[1:02:46] that it's
[1:02:48] Nimrod it's
[1:02:50] Babylon she's moving all of the chest
[1:02:53] pieces
[1:02:57] because she thinks she going to chatmate
[1:03:00] God but I want you
[1:03:03] to but I want you to
[1:03:06] understand God destroyed the first
[1:03:09] one God destroyed the
[1:03:12] second and God will destroy the
[1:03:15] third she'll never be able to
[1:03:19] accomplish oh come on somebody Satan is
[1:03:23] not our God
[1:03:26] no no no no no no no no so he carried me
[1:03:32] away in the spirit Into the
[1:03:35] Wilderness third
[1:03:37] verse and I saw a woman sit upon a
[1:03:40] Scarlet colored
[1:03:43] Beast full of names of blasphemy having
[1:03:46] seven heads and 10
[1:03:49] horns and the woman was array in
[1:03:52] purple scarl
[1:03:54] color and Deck with gold and precious
[1:03:57] stones and
[1:04:00] Pearls having a golden cup in her
[1:04:03] hand full of
[1:04:05] abomination and fil of her
[1:04:09] fornication Hallelujah you love the
[1:04:13] Lord now we as
[1:04:16] pastors we stand as

[1:04:24] made us a voice no
[1:04:26] she

[1:04:31] Angel but our instructions come from the
[1:04:33] almighty
[1:04:35] God hallelujah hallelujah now I want you
[1:04:38] to understand you may think that this is
[1:04:42] going to be a pushover
[1:04:46] thing you're going to be

[1:04:51] tried you will be
[1:04:54] tested is that right I mean even in

[1:05:13] expecting another rain another
[1:05:18] anointing that will bring us into that
[1:05:20] final
[1:05:21] stage that final transition
[1:05:26] y understand what I'm saying that final
[1:05:29] transition where these old
[1:05:32] bodies take off
[1:05:34] mortality and put on
[1:05:37] immortality that's where we head it I
[1:05:40] got to hurry up I'm I'm I'm I'm losing

[1:11:25] for God or his word or his people or his
[1:11:29] ministry or nothing where are they going
[1:11:33] to come up at in the resurrection but

[1:12:06] are except you believe that I am
[1:12:10] he he should likewise die in your
[1:12:13] sins and we've come to the very same day
[1:12:17] where the son of man has revealed
[1:12:20] himself through a son of man is that
[1:12:23] right and he B except you believe that I
[1:12:26] am he you should likewise die in your
[1:12:30] sin that is nothing but the
[1:12:33] TR God can't
[1:12:38] change we must have a conscience of his
[1:12:42] presence paragraph
[1:12:45] 78 coming from the
[1:12:48] influence you love the
[1:12:50] Lord but that listen he talks about the
[1:12:53] little woman

[1:12:56] His
[1:12:58] Garment she got her
[1:13:03] desires we've got to
[1:13:06] be we've got to be conscience of God's
[1:13:11] presence this little five senses that we
[1:13:13] live in that's that's just a little
[1:13:17] world of our
[1:13:19] own that but but God that's we was only
[1:13:24] given these so we could contact our
[1:13:27] Earthly
[1:13:31] home but there is senses beyond
[1:13:35] that another
[1:13:38] Dimensions amen and God is always
[1:13:41] present y'all better hear hear this if
[1:13:45] we could only remember
[1:13:47] that the angel the Lord are encamped

[1:14:03] tonight is host of
[1:14:06] angels thousands of them gathered
[1:14:09] around he said you don't see them but
[1:14:13] you can feel the influence of
[1:14:15] them telling you that they are here if
[1:14:20] that isn't so then the scripture isn't
[1:14:24] so scripture isn't right God isn't right
[1:14:29] the Bible said that the angel of God are
[1:14:33] camped they don't leave they stay near
[1:14:37] those that fear
[1:14:39] Him Hallelujah is that right Jesus said
[1:14:44] whereever two or three are gathered in
[1:14:47] my name be in their
[1:14:50] midst that makes
[1:14:53] him in a a world that we cannot see that
[1:14:59] our five senses doesn't contact but
[1:15:02] Jesus Christ is here
[1:15:05] present if we could be conscience of
[1:15:10] that that's the problem we lose
[1:15:13] consciousness of him and when we lose
[1:15:17] consciousness of him we lose respect for
[1:15:22] him Hallelujah
[1:15:25] glory to God psalm
[1:15:27] 16 Hallelujah just a little bit

[1:16:40] baby no man she didn't care what it
[1:16:44] meant to to what the people
[1:16:48] said she had actually met an angel of
[1:16:51] God and put her into
[1:16:56] action she was conscious am that the
[1:16:59] Holy Ghost was upon
[1:17:01] hering in her a
[1:17:04] life I just get excited oh oh if we
[1:17:09] could only realize
[1:17:11] that that the Holy Ghost is upon
[1:17:14] us creating in us a
[1:17:18] faith trying to present
[1:17:21] himself in so many different ways
[1:17:25] to create a faith for a rapturing
[1:17:29] church it should put us into
[1:17:32] action I wonder if we're just doing it
[1:17:35] the way we want to it to
[1:17:40] be with reverence and
[1:17:43] humility the pill of fire in the last
[1:17:46] day to put the whole church into

[1:18:08] you
[1:18:11] tonight until the people get ready to
[1:18:18] confess there is no need of having these
[1:18:21] healing services
[1:18:25] if you would confess your
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:28] sins your
[1:18:31] unbelief confess the things that you are
[1:18:33] doing
[1:18:35] wrong then God can do
[1:18:38] something but until there is a
[1:18:41] confession there can be no
[1:18:45] cleansing Hallelujah as soon as Isa
[1:18:49] said always me I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:18:55] with the people of unclean
[1:18:57] lips come the
[1:18:59] confession then come the
[1:19:02] cherubim with the fire did you notice
[1:19:06] God never used a CER Seminary to cleanse
[1:19:09] him
[1:19:10] with he never used a book of
[1:19:16] law he cleansed him by
[1:19:20] fire hallelujah hallelujah God always
[1:19:23] cleans his servants
[1:19:25] when he is ready to put them in Duty by
[1:19:28] the Holy Ghost and Fire God cleans by
[1:19:32] fire by books not by education not by
[1:19:37] intelligence conception not by
[1:19:41] denomination by the fire of the Holy
[1:19:43] Ghost God cleanses his
[1:19:47] servants me say this we have gotten
[1:19:51] away from the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:19:57] in this message everybody's trying to
[1:20:00] see you can be deeper than one or the
[1:20:03] other preachers have made people
[1:20:07] sick like Moses did he gave them meat
[1:20:12] out
[1:20:14] seon that's why brother bham made sure
[1:20:19] that when he gave us meat it was me a
[1:20:22] new season
[1:20:25] and that's what has happened we taken
[1:20:29] revelation we ran with it Hallelujah out
[1:20:32] of
[1:20:33] season now is the
[1:20:36] season but most people are so
[1:20:39] sick they don't even know how to eat
[1:20:45] anymore they can quote brother
[1:20:47] brandom but never received it
[1:20:50] here because it was so deep they threw
[1:20:53] it back up
[1:20:57] then
[1:21:00] notice right then after the
[1:21:03] confession after the
[1:21:05] cleansing then come the
[1:21:08] commission then what was
[1:21:10] commission after confessed and
[1:21:13] cleansed it was been that the king
[1:21:16] Isaiah answered
[1:21:20] God I send me after he was
[1:21:25] cleansed
[1:21:27] confessed cleansed by the
[1:21:29] fire then that CLE then that clean
[1:21:33] Isaiah was ready for
[1:21:36] work he was ready to be an
[1:21:39] example he was ready to have put his
[1:21:42] life out that others could be influenced
[1:21:45] by
[1:21:46] him this
[1:21:49] process of the Rapture you got to be
[1:21:53] cleansed you got to
[1:21:56] confess and then the
[1:21:58] fire y'all hear what I'm saying and this
[1:22:02] fire that falls from
