[1:02:59] he says you made a way
[1:03:02] when our backs was against the walls
[1:03:06] he made a way he did the same thing for
[1:03:09] the children of israel
[1:03:11] they had a red sea in front of them and
[1:03:13] they had the army
[1:03:14] of pharaoh coming towards them but god
[1:03:17] made a way for them
[1:03:18] so if he did it for them he can do the
[1:03:20] same thing for you and me amen
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:37] oh you made a way
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:55] and we are standing
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:10] backs were against the wall and it
[1:04:13] looked as if
[1:04:14] it was over
[1:04:26] [Music]
[1:04:45] there is nothing that's impossible
[1:04:51] and we are standing
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:05:06] with your power
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:14] that's impossible
[1:05:17] and we are standing here only
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:29] and we are standing here only because
[1:05:33] you
[1:05:34] made
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:47] let us open our bibles to the book of
[1:05:51] leviticus chapter 25
[1:06:01] it's good to see everyone who made it to
[1:06:03] church this morning amen
[1:06:07] every time we come to church on a sunday
[1:06:08] morning commemorating the resurrection
[1:06:10] of christ hallelujah
[1:06:14] he's the only one who rose
[1:06:28] then shall thou cause the trumpet of
[1:06:30] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[1:06:32] seventh month
[1:06:33] in the day of atonement shall you make a
[1:06:35] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[1:06:49] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[1:06:51] land unto all the inhabitants thereof
[1:06:53] it shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[1:06:56] shall return
[1:06:57] every man unto his possession and he
[1:07:00] shall return every man unto his family
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:25] open it up
[1:07:37] it only takes you the author of the word
[1:07:39] to make it known
[1:07:40] and for us to understand what you're
[1:07:42] telling us
[1:07:44] now we are gathered in this place in
[1:07:46] your house
[1:07:47] knowing you are a god that meets each
[1:07:49] and every appointment that he makes
[1:07:52] each and everyone came we came here lord
[1:07:54] expecting to hear from you
[1:07:58] i pray oh lord that you grant each and
[1:07:59] every heart's desire
[1:08:03] i pray oh lord that you answer each and
[1:08:05] every question
[1:08:08] so that when we leave this place
[1:08:12] we can say for sure the lord spoke to us
[1:08:16] for sure the lord was in this place
[1:08:19] and we'll forever give you thanks in
[1:08:21] jesus name we pray
[1:08:27] uh so just for a little while i want to
[1:08:30] speak on
[1:08:31] the subject declaring crisis acceptable
[1:08:34] here
[1:08:36] apart
[1:08:40] so in the bible where we read in
[1:08:42] leviticus chapter 25.
[1:08:48] god gave a commandment to the children
[1:08:50] of israel
[1:08:53] that on the 10th day of ever on the 10th
[1:08:56] day
[1:08:57] of every seventh month
[1:09:01] there was to be a day of atonement so
[1:09:06] once every year the high priest would
[1:09:08] walk in
[1:09:09] to sacrifice
[1:09:15] he walked into the holy of holies
[1:09:19] for an atonement for the sins of himself
[1:09:21] in the whole children of israel
[1:09:26] although law was in effect we saw god
[1:09:28] had already provided grace
[1:09:35] that he would forgive the sins that the
[1:09:37] people would have already made
[1:09:41] but now in verse 10 it tells us that in
[1:09:44] the 50th year
[1:09:45] it was a day of jubilee
[1:09:55] so on the seventh day of the on the
[1:09:58] tenth day of the seventh month
[1:10:00] of the 50th year it was a day of jubilee
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:05] mode after every 50 years on this date
[1:10:10] the high priest would blow out the
[1:10:14] trumpet
[1:10:45] no matter how long they had been slaves
[1:10:50] trumpet of jubilee they would know it's
[1:10:52] time to go
[1:10:56] no matter what believe
[1:11:11] if someone committed a crime is
[1:11:13] secretary clinton
[1:11:15] they would sell themselves to to their
[1:11:17] creditors
[1:11:22] to the people that would have wronged
[1:11:23] the legion they would
[1:11:33] and their property their land that had
[1:11:35] been given to them from their
[1:11:36] forefathers
[1:11:38] was also was also taken away from them
[1:11:46] when the children of israel crossed into
[1:11:48] canaan and they were given this
[1:11:49] land if you had done wrong your land was
[1:11:52] going to take
[1:12:05] if you made it wrong it was taken
[1:12:25] so there were two types of slaves oh
[1:12:26] yeah if you do salt
[1:12:28] this lab this lava they were they were
[1:12:31] slaves that were the of the children of
[1:12:33] israel
[1:12:34] this and there were slaves that were not
[1:12:38] of the children of israel
[1:12:41] israel and now on this day of atonement
[1:12:44] when the
[1:12:45] high priest would blow this trumpet
[1:12:48] expeditionary
[1:12:50] only the slaves that were the children
[1:12:52] of the children of israel could go free
[1:12:54] solely those that had been free before
[1:13:00] but those that were not of the children
[1:13:02] of israel could not go
[1:13:15] so when we hear that gospel trumpet of
[1:13:17] jubilee
[1:13:21] it signifies freedom to you and me
[1:13:25] anyone else who is not a spiritual seed
[1:13:28] of abraham when they hear it doesn't
[1:13:29] mean nothing to them
[1:13:40] amen so when someone committed a crime
[1:13:44] or when they would get
[1:13:45] taken as a slave a loss
[1:13:50] you say they would lose their
[1:13:52] inheritance
[1:13:54] they would lose their property and they
[1:13:57] were owned by task masters
[1:14:12] and there was no court of law that could
[1:14:14] let them go free
[1:14:17] because it would it would uh it would
[1:14:19] attest that this person is a slave they
[1:14:21] are not a free person
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:52] every person who would be bound they'll
[1:14:54] be
[1:15:09] at night they wouldn't sleep waiting for
[1:15:11] the daybreak of the
[1:15:12] of the tenth day
[1:15:16] because they knew that their past was
[1:15:18] over
[1:15:21] that their lives was about to change
[1:15:26] they were no longer to be slaves anymore
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:30] those who had been separated with their
[1:15:32] families they knew they had to go back
[1:15:37] and they'll be counting down until that
[1:15:39] 50th year
[1:15:43] because they know this is my time for my
[1:15:45] freedom
[1:15:49] this is my time to get back my
[1:15:50] inheritance
[1:15:53] get that which i lost you
[1:15:57] but now you see you believe this was a
[1:15:59] choice
[1:16:02] it was not forced on people
[1:16:06] so when you hear the trumpet of jubilee
[1:16:08] you had to make a decision
[1:16:12] you had to walk out of that slavery
[1:16:16] if you were in the field you had to
[1:16:18] decide to leave that the instrument or
[1:16:20] whatever hole you were using
[1:16:26] if you refused to listen to the trumpet
[1:16:28] of jubilee
[1:16:31] that would make you a slave forever if
[1:16:33] your honduras love
[1:16:34] no trumpet of jubilee would ever be able
[1:16:37] to set you free
[1:16:40] if you if you refuse to get this to if
[1:16:43] you refuse
[1:16:44] to listen to this trumpet of jubilee
[1:16:46] amen
[1:17:00] amen grace is your inheritance
[1:17:05] promise to you and me for me
[1:17:09] on the cross of calvary to give you and
[1:17:11] me grace jesus
[1:17:14] christ
[1:17:20] the other time i talked about abraham
[1:17:22] lincoln's story
[1:17:25] of destroyed abraham lincoln there was a
[1:17:27] young man who was in the revolutionary
[1:17:29] war
[1:17:33] he ran away from his duties as a soldier
[1:17:38] and that's a very big crime concrete and
[1:17:41] he was sentenced to
[1:17:42] to stand in front of the firing squad
[1:17:44] and be killed
[1:17:48] but his friend went to see the president
[1:17:50] abraham lincoln and asked
[1:17:52] for forgiveness and say can you give
[1:17:53] pardon to my to my friend
[1:17:55] mr mison
[1:18:01] president abraham lincoln he signed a
[1:18:03] paper that says i president
[1:18:05] abraham lincoln i pardon you you are not
[1:18:07] to die
[1:18:39] came he faced the firing squad and he
[1:18:40] was shot and he died
[1:18:45] they tried to take uh them to the course
[1:18:47] of law to say why did you kill this man
[1:18:49] although he was pardoned by the
[1:18:52] president
[1:19:18] mercy has no effect on you until we
[1:19:20] accept
[1:19:30] so this was all typing oh the old
[1:19:32] testament was typing the new testament
[1:19:37] we have seen many instances where
[1:19:39] jubilee was
[1:19:40] shown in the bible
[1:19:48] he was right there and they were being
[1:19:50] tormented by the philistines
[1:19:54] and all his crops were being taken
[1:19:58] but then he realized and he said i am a
[1:20:00] son of abraham
[1:20:08] my forefather that i am not to be bound
[1:20:10] i'm not supposed to be a slave
[1:20:14] and he stood on that word of god
[1:20:26] and he walked out and killed 600
[1:20:28] philistines with an ox god
[1:20:30] a resortie that you see see some uh
[1:20:32] philistine awake
[1:20:35] because even realize today was my
[1:20:37] jubilee
[1:20:42] he realized that this was the day he had
[1:20:44] to be set free he accepted it
[1:20:48] amen let us open our bibles to luke
[1:20:52] chapter 4 verse 17.
[1:20:58] controversy
[1:21:00] luke chapter 4 verse 17
[1:21:08] it reads and there was delivered unto
[1:21:10] him
[1:21:11] the book of the prophet isaiah's and
[1:21:14] when he had opened the book he found the
[1:21:15] place where it was written
[1:21:17] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:21:19] because he had anointed me to preach the
[1:21:21] gospel to the poor
[1:21:23] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:21:26] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:21:28] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[1:21:30] set at liberty
[1:21:31] them that are bruised
[1:21:54] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:21:56] lord
[1:22:01] what verse is that verse 19 to preach
[1:22:04] the acceptable year of the lord
[1:22:09] and he closed the book either
[1:22:12] and he gave it again to the minister and
[1:22:14] he sat down.
[1:22:17] verse 21 he says and he began to say
[1:22:20] unto them
[1:22:21] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[1:22:23] your ears
[1:22:28] so we realized that jesus when he was in
[1:22:30] the synagogue he opened the
[1:22:31] bible to isaiah chapter 61.
[1:22:45] the whole verse says to proclaim the
[1:22:47] acceptable year of the lord
[1:22:48] and the day of vengeance of our god to
[1:22:51] comfort all that mourn
[1:22:52] university
[1:22:56] but when jesus was reading this
[1:22:58] scripture he didn't read the whole
[1:23:00] scripture
[1:23:04] he just read to proclaim the acceptable
[1:23:06] year of the lord
[1:23:09] and he said this day this scripture is
[1:23:11] fulfilled
[1:23:14] so he was only reading that part that
[1:23:16] applied to his ministry then in that day
[1:23:18] inaudible
[1:23:30] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:23:32] lord
[1:23:57] jesus was coming on the scene to say
[1:23:59] this i am the real jubilee
[1:24:11] he picked up the scripture and read
[1:24:26] and then he laid the book down and say
[1:24:28] today this is
[1:24:30] and say today the scripture is fulfilled
[1:24:35] when he was to preach the year of
[1:24:36] jubilee now why didn't you read the rest
[1:24:38] of it
[1:24:43] because the other part pertains to his
[1:24:44] other comics
[1:24:49] they had no need to know that
[1:24:53] that was for another age but the age
[1:24:56] that he was and that's the reason he
[1:24:57] could
[1:24:58] say this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:24:59] eyes today
[1:25:07] to praise the acceptable season
[1:25:10] season
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:22] so jesus was saying this is my mission
[1:25:24] on coming down on earth
[1:25:28] i have come to set you free
[1:25:31] all the priests that had come in the old
[1:25:33] testament
[1:25:36] that had come to an end
[1:25:52] and um it says the acceptable year as we
[1:25:55] all know the prophet says
[1:26:00] the year of jubilee that's when all the
[1:26:03] slaves and prisoners as they were being
[1:26:05] taken
[1:26:05] prison syllabus
[1:26:20] and they were in bondage is it no matter
[1:26:23] how long they had been in bondage or how
[1:26:25] long they were supposed to stay there
[1:26:32] when the year come of jubilee when the
[1:26:34] trumpet sounded
[1:26:49] acceptable time the time of jubilee
[1:26:55] anybody no matter who you are
[1:26:58] no matter what color you are what
[1:27:00] denomination you belong to
[1:27:11] it doesn't matter what's wrong with you
[1:27:12] you can go free when you hear the gospel
[1:27:14] trumpet sound outside
[1:27:28] so when he read the scripture he says i
[1:27:31] am here to
[1:27:32] set all those that are in bondage
[1:27:40] give sight to the blind
[1:27:43] he came in as our kinsmen redeemer
[1:27:58] called amen that's why he died on the
[1:28:02] cross
[1:28:06] we are the closest we're the closest kid
[1:28:08] we were to jesus
[1:28:11] we are the closest king to jesus
[1:28:16] christ jesus and us we are all abraham's
[1:28:18] seed
[1:28:21] in galatians it reads for ye are the
[1:28:23] children of god by faith in jesus christ
[1:28:28] and if you be christ then you are
[1:28:30] abraham's seed
[1:28:34] it is according to the promise so the
[1:28:37] moment you accepted christ as your
[1:28:38] savior you became your kinsman allah
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:54] so he was the only one who could who was
[1:28:57] able to pay the price of redemption for
[1:28:58] you and me
[1:29:02] to redeem us from the slavery that we
[1:29:04] were in
[1:29:06] he came to take away our sins
[1:29:10] to erase all of it live newly fashioned
[1:29:13] and he says you are justified you and me
[1:29:15] we are justified
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:19] when he pay the price you say you never
[1:29:21] did it in the first place
[1:29:25] he put it back on the devil and said you
[1:29:27] are the one who made him do it
[1:29:28] he is not guilty
[1:29:34] so you can stand clean blameless and
[1:29:36] justified
[1:30:09] when jesus comes and he's when he came
[1:30:11] and he was preaching the acceptable year
[1:30:13] of jubilee to you and me that has no
[1:30:15] effect until you accept it
[1:30:28] god came down from heaven and he put
[1:30:30] himself in
[1:30:31] the body of jesus
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:42] when he was on the cross of calvary with
[1:30:44] his last breath he cried it is finished
[1:31:00] it is finished that's when you were
[1:31:01] healed
[1:31:04] so it is already there you just have to
[1:31:06] claim it and accept it
[1:31:10] when he cried it is finished the devil
[1:31:12] thought he was saying he is finished
[1:31:28] before the foundation of the world was
[1:31:30] available
[1:31:32] and he was still lucifer
[1:31:37] and we know in the old testament before
[1:31:38] jesus died on the cross satan had power
[1:31:41] of death
[1:31:56] he went to satan's kingdom and he
[1:31:59] overcame and took the keys of
[1:32:01] death helen the grave
[1:32:06] and when he rose up on the third day he
[1:32:07] was victorious
[1:32:10] he said the whole
[1:32:26] the authority that adam had before he
[1:32:28] was returning it back to us
[1:32:33] because when adam fell he lost that
[1:32:35] power
[1:32:38] so when he rose victorious he was giving
[1:32:39] it back to you and me
[1:32:44] those that believe that jesus christ
[1:32:46] died for them
[1:32:49] you and me we are the bride of christ
[1:33:07] here is the tragedy if a man did not
[1:33:09] desire to go back and he wanted to
[1:33:11] remain there
[1:33:18] then his master would walk up to him and
[1:33:20] say you desire to still be my slave
[1:33:26] then if you say yes then they'll take
[1:33:27] them down to the temple
[1:33:31] took them before the people
[1:33:34] of vandalism as a public testimony and
[1:33:37] put his ear
[1:33:38] up against the post and they would make
[1:33:39] a hole in his ear
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:46] and that person could never be free
[1:33:48] again
[1:33:50] there was no trumpet of jubilee that
[1:33:52] could set them free
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:57] and it was a public testimony that this
[1:33:59] person is
[1:34:00] forever a slave
[1:34:17] that people are receiving the holy
[1:34:18] spirit
[1:34:20] you deliberately and willfully turn it
[1:34:22] down
[1:34:26] god has no more not under any obligation
[1:34:28] to ever speak to you no more
[1:34:35] and to reject christ and to turn him
[1:34:37] down
[1:34:40] after he is knocked at your door you're
[1:34:42] on the danger line of being bored in
[1:34:44] your ears
[1:35:20] when the word of god tells you to do
[1:35:22] something you don't want to do it
[1:35:26] why because
[1:35:29] [Music]
[1:35:39] why you are refusing the person refusing
[1:35:41] the trumpet of jubilee
[1:35:43] refuse this year people have a right to
[1:35:47] do whatever they want
[1:35:51] people want to do things their own way
[1:35:54] they
[1:35:54] choose people say you cannot judge me
[1:35:59] yes we cannot judge you but the word
[1:36:00] judges you wait
[1:36:04] someone says the word says that but my
[1:36:06] church says that
[1:36:08] this is
[1:36:22] you are not being set free you are bound
[1:36:25] by chains of your church
[1:36:29] but i have good news for you christ when
[1:36:31] he said it is finished
[1:36:35] that was a jubilee for you and me
[1:36:38] all we have to do is accept and move
[1:36:40] into it
[1:36:43] and say lord what do you want me to do
[1:36:47] what does your word say about me
[1:37:01] his mission was to preach jubilee to you
[1:37:04] submission
[1:37:32] doing things that they ought not to do
[1:37:34] and become slaves to the devil
[1:37:37] um
[1:37:47] so some people have willingly gone to
[1:37:49] the devil and say i want to be your
[1:37:50] slave
[1:37:51] to something
[1:37:55] selling yourself to addictions
[1:37:59] things you know that the world says
[1:38:00] that's not right
[1:38:03] people have sold themselves to be slaves
[1:38:09] but i have good news the jubilee didn't
[1:38:11] care whether you had sold yourself or it
[1:38:13] was circumstances
[1:38:51] to go steal but calls the cops on you
[1:38:53] afterwards
[1:39:10] but he is doing that so that he knows
[1:39:12] the moment you cross the line
[1:39:14] you will be judged by god
[1:39:20] but you just have to know if you resist
[1:39:22] the devil he'll flee away from you
[1:39:37] overcame satan by the word
[1:39:41] he eventually left him why because the
[1:39:45] word says
[1:39:45] resist the devil and he will flee away
[1:39:47] from you
[1:39:49] if you run away from every appearance of
[1:39:52] evil
[1:39:56] because the devil he wants to bind you
[1:39:59] he wants to get you in that place of an
[1:40:01] addiction he views on me don't sit down
[1:40:04] i've seen and you cannot get out of it
[1:40:06] eventually
[1:40:19] because the moment you start reading
[1:40:30] so satan wants to get you to be so busy
[1:40:32] with things
[1:40:47] it has all it has to do for you it has
[1:40:50] to set you free
[1:40:53] because god says i know the plans that i
[1:40:54] have for you the plans for you to
[1:40:56] prosper
[1:40:59] the prosperity it doesn't matter
[1:41:00] whatever situation you are in
[1:41:02] a situation
[1:41:39] the prophet of god said so if you are
[1:41:40] lukewarm brother that's a dangerous
[1:41:42] place you could stand
[1:41:43] the prophet did you decide
[1:42:15] that's the thing we get so accustomed to
[1:42:18] a nice
[1:42:19] easy life
[1:42:22] where we are lukewarm we are borderline
[1:42:24] one leg in one leg out
[1:42:26] um
[1:42:34] if we come to church and go back home
[1:42:35] that's good enough
[1:42:38] attend a few services that's then that's
[1:42:40] good enough
[1:42:43] you haven't even started
[1:42:47] christianity is a bondage the the system
[1:42:50] it is a sticky on isla
[1:42:52] god does not want that no no
[1:42:55] god doesn't care you either you come to
[1:42:57] church or not
[1:43:00] you were supposed to come to church
[1:43:03] because that's where he's going to meet
[1:43:04] you
[1:43:05] but that's not where it ends
[1:43:08] so
[1:43:20] after you hear the word what are you
[1:43:21] gonna do about it
[1:43:36] that have nothing to do with god but god
[1:43:39] does not want that
[1:43:41] in the house of the lord there is
[1:43:43] liberty
[1:43:45] it is the anointing that breaks the yolk
[1:43:50] that breaks the
[1:43:53] so when you come into the house of the
[1:43:55] lord
[1:43:57] you see this is my place to be free
[1:44:02] because jesus came to search you and me
[1:44:04] free
[1:44:07] we just gotta rise up and walk
[1:44:11] amen because he had already already has
[1:44:13] opened the way for us
[1:44:16] amen amen already called the prophet of
[1:44:19] god say christ defeated satan
[1:44:21] the prophet christ
[1:44:24] of everything he ever had um
[1:44:30] and he is nothing today by the bluff
[1:44:35] when he tells you we cannot have another
[1:44:38] holy ghost
[1:44:38] outpouring of the spirit
[1:44:45] we can have it today
[1:45:13] why because god rules and reigns today
[1:45:15] hallelujah
[1:45:18] so you and me we can live an experience
[1:45:20] of the living god
[1:45:23] because he overcame death hell on the
[1:45:25] grave
[1:46:21] the curtain that was on the that was in
[1:46:23] the temple it ran from top to bottom
[1:46:29] because the priesthood of aaron was no
[1:46:31] longer of no effect
[1:46:35] the priesthood of aaron who had was no
[1:46:37] longer of effect muscular sacrifice
[1:46:41] jesus christ now the high priest that
[1:46:43] starts by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:46:50] he was coming in to give us grace
[1:46:53] according to us he totally delivered the
[1:46:55] world from sin amen
[1:46:58] he delivered the church so there is no
[1:47:01] there's no need for us to leave
[1:47:02] underprivileged
[1:47:14] because he defeated the devil and took
[1:47:16] the principalities and powers
[1:47:19] the principles
[1:47:34] the devil doesn't have to dictate
[1:47:36] anything to us
[1:47:39] christ delivered us from all habits
[1:47:44] he delivered us from all talking
[1:47:48] he delivered
[1:48:03] deliverance
[1:48:06] total so the title deed that you had to
[1:48:09] your land
[1:48:10] when the when the trumpet of jubilee
[1:48:12] sounds is given back to you
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:16] ever
[1:48:25] it doesn't matter how much buildings
[1:48:27] they had put on your land
[1:48:28] very importantly
[1:48:50] the trumpet of jubilee was giving you
[1:48:52] back the rights you had before the fault
[1:48:54] the trumpet did you believe zach did it
[1:48:56] before you lost
[1:48:57] what you had the trumpet of jubilees
[1:49:00] giving you
[1:49:00] your rightful possession
[1:49:06] no one can stop you
[1:49:09] the holy ghost that will make that
[1:49:12] person leave that squatter
[1:49:15] he has no right all you have to do is
[1:49:17] realize that the trumpet of jubilee is
[1:49:19] setting me free
[1:49:24] for total restoration
[1:49:32] hallelujah the prophet of god gives us a
[1:49:34] story of this crow called
[1:49:35] old johnny crow the prophet
[1:49:40] this crow was tied by a farmer
[1:49:45] so that the other crows could not come
[1:49:47] and eat the crops when they see this
[1:49:48] crawl
[1:49:49] tight they'll be scared and run away
[1:49:57] but one good man came and he cut off the
[1:49:59] rope the
[1:50:00] the rob that was tying this old crop
[1:50:05] but although this rope was cut
[1:50:08] boy
[1:50:16] he kept on walking in a circle in the
[1:50:18] place where he was
[1:50:19] he was uh tied and it was bound in
[1:50:21] physical martial
[1:50:47] we still want to stand in the place of
[1:50:49] being bound
[1:52:42] because he came to restore us to the
[1:52:43] position where we were before
[1:52:48] thank god for our jubilee
[1:52:51] it makes us realize our identity
[1:52:55] we are normal slaves but we're a child
[1:52:56] of god
[1:53:00] the singer said i am no longer slave to
[1:53:02] sin
[1:53:04] but i am a child of god but because
[1:53:08] he came to make you realize your
[1:53:10] identity
[1:53:23] i am not a slave to the things that used
[1:53:26] to hold me before
[1:53:27] slav i'm a child of god
[1:53:32] no depression can hold me back anymore
[1:53:36] no low self-esteem can hold me back
[1:53:38] anymore
[1:53:40] because i know i'm a child of the king
[1:53:48] i am not a nobody um
[1:53:54] you are a child of the most high god
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:58] you got to walk in faith not in fear
[1:54:01] um faith is not
[1:54:04] uh and i think so la funny
[1:54:19] is worth a thousand worlds that's good
[1:54:24] that's why the devil is finally more
[1:54:25] hard to take you down
[1:54:30] you realize who you are
[1:54:34] that jesus christ paid his blood for you
[1:54:39] you know that you have a lot of value
[1:54:43] and that day that's when the devil lost
[1:54:45] it
[1:54:46] so you gotta stand and take your
[1:54:48] rightful place
[1:54:51] chase the devil away from your land
[1:54:56] you have each and every right to get it
[1:54:57] back
[1:55:01] it is time to rise and claim
[1:55:16] whether it
[1:55:31] healing and you've been falling
[1:55:34] sick that's your property
[1:55:40] when god says it's yours it's yours
[1:55:43] no one can first
[1:55:56] salvation is yours
[1:56:11] so when the devil tries
[1:56:26] maybe you have lost your financials you
[1:56:28] have lost your job
[1:56:36] yours the inheritance says that's yours
[1:56:39] you have the future of every rightful
[1:56:56] he said you shall be the head and not
[1:56:58] the tail
[1:57:02] and not beneath it
[1:57:05] inheritance
[1:57:09] it doesn't matter even if you're in
[1:57:10] school you're having bad grades we're
[1:57:12] important
[1:57:14] you go to the devil and you say the
[1:57:15] inheritance says i'm above and not
[1:57:17] beneath
[1:57:19] the power
[1:57:36] and also your loved ones you can also
[1:57:38] get them out
[1:57:41] someone was bound and they couldn't walk
[1:57:43] out a kinsmen redeemer would come and
[1:57:45] take him out
[1:57:58] if you have a loved one that's being
[1:58:00] tormented by cancer you can go redeem
[1:58:02] them
[1:58:04] to multiple concepts
[1:58:18] or high blood pressure
[1:58:22] that's not a fact it might not be
[1:58:24] affecting you but your loved one
[1:58:27] you walk to the devil and say you know
[1:58:29] that you don't have no right no more
[1:58:31] merciful
[1:58:48] i don't care whatever pretty name they
[1:58:50] might try and give it
[1:58:53] that's the task masters change it's only
[1:58:55] changed you don't have to care about
