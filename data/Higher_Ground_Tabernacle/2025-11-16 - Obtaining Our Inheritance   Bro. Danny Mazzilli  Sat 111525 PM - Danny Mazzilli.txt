His pastor, &gt;&gt; John Simon, has been here and he preached for us. And if you ever heard brother John Simon, you were blessed &gt;&gt; because God always speaks to him. &gt;&gt; And uh I I just thank God for my brother Danny. &gt;&gt; Uh we we we've been trying to get this done for years now. &gt;&gt; Uh the last we had our ministers retreat with wives there in Michigan, homage country, whatever you call it.

I expected more to be here. But everybody is here are those who were ordained to be so. &gt;&gt; So we thank you for your prayers when we were there in Arizona. It was absolutely wonderful. &gt;&gt; Uh we saw God do great things. Different different people were healed instantly. &gt;&gt; Uh the message or the word was powerful &gt;&gt; and I'll never be the same. And that's the way I love the word. I love it when the word do those things for me. &gt;&gt; Change me and take me to another level &gt;&gt; in understanding and revelation &gt;&gt; because that's what it's all about tonight. It's not how good or how dramatically a man can preach. &gt;&gt; It's about the truth. &gt;&gt; And if we can receive the truth, &gt;&gt; we can see Christ. We can receive the word. And thereby grow &gt;&gt; into his very image and likeness. I'm not the preacher. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So anyway, brother Danny, would you come and and have have free course how the Lord would lead you, sir? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Isaiah So appreciate John Simon. enjoyed being here with you &gt;&gt; and um it was uh I guess about 20 I'm going to say about 27 years ago &gt;&gt; we first met brother Isaiah we were holding an outreach &gt;&gt; in Hamilton Ontario &gt;&gt; and brother Isaiah along with the La Fontaine family had been invited and minister and I had no idea the gift that was laying in brother Isaiah. I was playing guitar at the time for the church band and bus. &gt;&gt; I felt like a like a like a band celebrity playing for &gt;&gt; when I heard him sing I said glory. &gt;&gt; But you know what? made the right choice when he decided to get he could have been a superstar but he gave his gift unto the Lord and here you are today the beneficiary I understand he's been in the ministry now since 1984 85 this message glorious word that we feed upon and that we're so blessed &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour. Amen. I um uh was recently uh placed as the pastor. &gt;&gt; Our precious brother John Simon retired retired. He's still quite active. He's actually going to be preaching tomorrow morning um back home. But um you got to forgive me for the you know I'm just a young pastor. So, I just trust that, you know, I'm just going to deliver what's on my heart and I trust that, you know, that you will receive the blessing and that it would uh have an effect on you today. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so, um, let's just have a word of prayer and then we're going to go to the word. Father, what a privilege this evening, Lord, &gt;&gt; that we can assemble under the revelation that gives us to speak your word season, Father. There are still sons and daughters of God, Father, that need to hear you. All of them in this day and in this hour, bring them into their physicians as sons and daughters. And tonight we're here as senators asking that Lord that you would break, give ears to him to speak your word tonight. We're just human vessels, Father, but we've come into the uh liberty of daughters of God. So we can rejoice around Have your way. Have your liberty. And bless your people now. Give ourselves to your service. &gt;&gt; Bless this ministry. Lord, continue to prosper. Our precious brother Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Praise God. Glor. &gt;&gt; So, we've been uh ministering for the last um you can put up the uh the first slide. Um we've been ministering a series &gt;&gt; over the last 10 weeks or so or maybe months and um it's it's a series on the purpose of God and it was based on uh you know being called unto adoption. And so tonight, I'm just trusting that, you know, I can bring um you know, uh kind of like a &gt;&gt; um a synopsis. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; of of uh you know, what the Lord has laid upon my heart, you know, services that that we've been ministering back home. And I'm trusting that, you know, that the Lord would just uh take the word and just speak to your individual needs and meet your needs. in the midst of it all because this is what has called us. This is what has given us the revelation to serve God is when we hear lip to ear from God that he speaks to our needs and and gives us uh you know what we have need of. Amen. To overcome in the age that we're living in. Amen. There's a portion of word that God has for you that gives you the ability to overcome in this particular age. Praise God. And so we want to take a look at that. We're going to read our scripture &gt;&gt; from Ephesians 1 9-11. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says here, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one in one all things in Christ." Amen. both which are in heaven and which are on earth in him. &gt;&gt; In whom also, now this is what we want to focus on today. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance. Amen. Praise God. Being predestinated according to the purpose of his workketh all things of his own will. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Um, and so you can go to the next slide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we're going to be looking at obtaining our inheritance. In the scripture we just read, it talks about in whom. So in Christ, &gt;&gt; we have an inheritance waiting for us. Amen. And we want to, you know, we want to understand this inheritance. Praise God. You know, I I'm a son. I belong to a family. I've got a father. You know, in order for me to know that I've got an inheritance, I need to see my name on the way. I need to know that my name has an inheritance. Book of God. our names written are ordained. And so by the preaching of the word revelation of this, we get to hear if our names are because when you recognize that you can recognize the word ordained for every Say amen to that inheritance from the book. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so Paul's speaking here. &gt;&gt; We know that this is um you know a type of &gt;&gt; the actual uh Ephesians is a type of the book of Joshua. speaking to us in this Joshua has listen and listen to brother talking about Joshua sons and daughters into their maturity praise God Joshua came out the ministry of Moses Exodus It was a glory to God. Moses did not them into the promised land. But Moses told them that that that Joshua would be a them in glory. The land was promised to them. promise to Abraham and maker is God inheritance that Abraham will still waiting on that just like you and I are waiting in order for us to see that we have to experience Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glory to you. &gt;&gt; And so this four-part series on adoption, it encompasses the entire of redemption. Go back to that series and that pertains to you. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the adoption, we're not talking about an adoption here like in a national individuals that wedlock and that child is put up and somebody takes that adoption adoption here. We're looking at a sexual adoption, spiritual adoption. Amen. Where a father back in the Old Testament Father inheritance because he was placing that son place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was given that son and he said he devil out of your certain life to do so. Amen. As an adopted son of God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, what is the Lord doing? He's perfecting. He's bringing sons into adoption. He's giving them an experience. They know they have a father. Not just a a regular father, a holy father, a heavenly father that's going to give us an inheritance. never thought. &gt;&gt; Let's read our first quote here from Brother and you'll see that most of these quotes come from the series on adoption. He says, "Look, now a little farther now. Now the 11th verse &gt;&gt; from the scriptures that we read that we read. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance. An inheritance. Somebody has to leave you something to inherit. Is that right? &gt;&gt; An inheritance. What inheritance do we have? What inheritance did I have? I didn't have any. But God left me an inheritance. But he put my name found. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is not some inheritance that just decided to write up before the foundation. Oh, you say now wait a minute. Jesus did that when he died. He never Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus come to purchase that inheritance for me. Every next verse he says the next verse we also have obtained an inheritance predestinated to the purpose of him all things after the counsel of his own. Glory to God. I'm glad and that he thought of me saw you in so that you would be received in this hour into a mature bring you into an adoption that you would receive an inheritance of your God. Listen, he goes on to say here in the next quote, he says, "Look, has predestinated us unto this inheritance. If I'm right, inheritance of something, God is knocking at my heart and saying, I called you a long time ago before the foundations of preach the gospel. I have an inheritance, an inheritance of eternal life." sent Jesus that inheritance to me. Listen, they want to they want to accept Buddha. They want Muhammad and all kinds of other people. Unless you accept Jesus Christ, there is absolutely no inheritance. Amen. How could there be an inheritance that is corruptible? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the only one that came and resurrected. Amen. And when I receive the Holy Ghost, he makes it real to me. I really truly got an inheritance. It's only when he he come and make it real God. Amen. He says because there was nothing to God. to inherit it. It was valid. There was nothing I could do. God sent in his good time. &gt;&gt; Jesus the slain from the foundations of the world. Hallelujah. It means so much more to the sons of God. Amen. Because that lamb take the book of inheritance and bring it in. He took that l that lamb. He one that could loose your name in there. You had an inheritance. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation. to my inheritance to be what? What inheritance? He said the sunship to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are living in the days of the manifestation of God. Amen. And this revelation of adoption and the inheritance is sealed up sons and daughters of manifest the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Unless we manifest the word. That's why the earth's groaning groaning for the manifestation of the revelation &gt;&gt; of the rapture. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God forever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Excuse me for getting a little excited, but this word, this this word is a reality. Amen. Hallelujah. The purpose of his first coming to the earth was to show that there was actually an invisible God that could become the word made. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His desire was always to be the word made flesh. When he listen when he made Adam, he made Adam image. God on earth in a man in a man. Amen. Praise God. Jesus came to earth in order to declare a father. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know what sunship is. How you going to know that you're a son unless you know you've got a father? How could you possibly know that you're a son without knowing the father? &gt;&gt; We could never have become conscious of being a son without that God had a purpose in coming to the earth and becoming word made flesh. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. You see, that's the mystery that's been sealed up from the foundation of And we're and we're blessed because God has sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That that in the days of the voice of the angel of God when he begins to sound there was going to be the mystery mysteries mysteries. Listen there's a lot of history that we all know about which is the church age mysteries and the mystery of iniquity. mystery of the godhead all mystery that goes beyond all of that. This is what his purpose was in coming to the earth. Hallelujah. Which was the mystery of God. God could &gt;&gt; listen Romans chapter 6 or &gt;&gt; sorry, Romans chapter 8, &gt;&gt; he says, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God," Amen. They are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, &gt;&gt; but ye have received the spirit of adoption. Here it is again. You've received something in you that is going to lead you into a position of authority here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit. &gt;&gt; What spirit? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. What we've got in this hour. Not not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I &gt;&gt; We need the baptism of the Holy Ghost from time to time because it anoints us and it anoints us to lay hands on the sick to to pray for those that need deliverance. Amen. But but this hour produces the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. which is God in you, &gt;&gt; Christ in you, your hope of glory, your inheritance. There's no inheritance without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You know, look, you just go back and and and you know when when when John the Baptist came to the earth, he introduced Jesus Christ. Amen. But notice that after after Christ had had died and resurrected, Amen, Paul, the same one that wrote the book of Ephesians here, the same one that's talking to the Romans. Amen. He come across a bunch of disciples one day. He saw they were praising Jesus. He saw they were praising God. But he asked him a question. He said, "How did you receive the Holy Ghost?" Come on now. &gt;&gt; They needed to recognize that the Holy Ghost had to come. They said, "We we've been uh baptized underapt." And that was the revealed. They were actually given the message of the hour. You know, there's a lot of people to be asked the same question if you receive the Holy Ghost. Oh my goodness. There's a lot of people who don't realize when the Holy Ghost comes, your life doesn't remain the same. It changes. God takes control. It it it takes it takes a hold of your desires. Your desires change. &gt;&gt; You you don't think the same way. Your your purpose is changed. I was telling the sister tonight, I was saying, you know, we were talking in the car and I was saying, listen, you know, cuz she asked a question about the, you know, the order of the of the of the the justification and sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I said, "And then the Holy Ghost himself." I said, "You need to recognize the element of the message of the hour because when it comes in you, it changes your desires. You got the Holy Ghost as a person." There's no way you're going to say, "I'm going to California so I can The Holy Ghost ain't going to ever leave you to California to be a movie star or to be a fashion designer." Amen. We're talking about the reality of God. You young people, you want to change, Lord, give me the Holy Ghost. I'm tired of going to these camps and sincere understand is the message of the message. They're making it too complicated. We're not interested in getting in all the mysteries of all the Listen, we can talk about thunders all day long, but when you've come to receive the Holy Ghost, you know what the you will understand the word is he will come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The scripture is telling us, &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. He says, "The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children. And if children, then hes with God and joint hes with what is Christ?" &gt;&gt; The anointed word. The anointed word for your day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus Christ in the present state of his ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And if so be that we suffer with him, &gt;&gt; that we may also be glorified together. &gt;&gt; Look what he says here.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, we want to look at, am I under the spirit of bondage &gt;&gt; or am I under the spirit of adoption? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to our next scripture here &gt;&gt; in Ro in Joshua chapter 1. We're just going to take a look at a few things back in the Old Testament. Amen. so that we can understand this relationship that we have as an adopted son or daughter.

He says, "Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun Moses minister, saying my servant is dead. Thou therefore arise, go over the Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel, every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses, are you got your spiritual thinking? You know, he he when he's talking about Israel, he's talking about you. &gt;&gt; He's giving you the land. &gt;&gt; What land? If we don't live your life right now in 2025, you've got a life. You've got a family. You've got a home. You've got you got responsibilities responsibility. He's telling you he's given you as a son. As an adopted son, you've got authority over these things. He says, he says, "Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Hittites, the great sea, towards the going down of the sun shall be on your coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thine life. As I was with brother and Moses, I will be with thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and courageous. To this people shall thou divine unto. to give them. You hear what he said? To give them for an inheritance. &gt;&gt; And we're talking about obtaining our inheritance. Amen. You're interested in your inheritance. Amen. I want my inheritance. Praise God. I want to know what it's all about. Amen. Go to the next slide. He says here, "But only be strong." He's reminding us here. Only be strong, very courageous. You're going to need to be very courageous. Amen. &gt;&gt; That thou mayest observe to do all &gt;&gt; which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left. Thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. The book of the law. Hallelujah. Shall not depart out of thy. Amen. God has given you the spoken word. Glory to God. But thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou may observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to go to the next slide. He says here in in verse 9 to 11, have I commanded thee? Look, he's fighting us again to be strong. It's not easy to run a to run a church to be to have leadership in the church. You need to be courageous to praise God. He says, "But be strong, courage, not afraid, neither be thou dismayed. God is with you. When you go to school, young people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, Joshua commanded the officers of the people command and command you victor with over this Jordan possess the land you possess. We're under another Ephesians. We're under the leadership of Joshua himself. He's telling He's telling you to prepare yourselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prepare yourselves because we're going to take our inheritance. Listen, we're by the time we're done tomorrow's service, we're going to understand what being a son is. We're going to have a level of confidence to be able to look at the enemy's eye as a son of God. Amen. With an revealed because it's been given he says here, go to the next slide. He says here, our Ephesians, our Joshua, which is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Joshua means our savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's always him. &gt;&gt; Don't be looking for anything else. Know that it's Jesus Christ, the savior. It's just it's just him in different. always been him from the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua means the Holy Spirit representing it. He was in the natural that he is our great warrior. He's our great leader. As God was with Joshua, so is God in the Holy Spirit us about. &gt;&gt; You see how these scriptures, they just keep coming. Amen. When when when you recognize that as a word that that's that's ordained as an attribute of God, you were in the mind of God. We came into this, but he knew you'd be here. knew that you would recognize. You knew that the minute that he watered you with his spirit that there be an attribute that would come to life and recognize its position. &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, the son of Dominic of of Ella what brother Brandham was talking about that he had You know that you're not a son of eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Go to the next uh slide there. He says positionally placing the church where they belong. Each one, every single one of you, you've got an inheritance. You've got a position in this church. You're here under this pastor. It's because God has placed you here position in this. You're not here to just warm the truth. They're going to hear about your name and you got an inheritance comes in position on the audio. God has God has anointed you with the ability to play his attributes &gt;&gt; as an inherited son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not play church. We're not just joining church. And when you look around and you see the churches is not so full, I think that's strange. When Jesus Christ was on the earth, there was only a few that could that could perceive what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; If you're looking to fill the church, it's because you're compromising the word. People need to know what the word, you need to know that God is. If there's sin in your life, you got to get it out. That's one of the things about being a son. Hallelujah. We're going to look at that a little bit. &gt;&gt; And he says, "God has adopted us sons. We are sons by birth adopted positionally placed by the Holy Spirit. They they were everyone Hebrews. When they crossed the river, Joshua divided them into one. utterance of his mother birth where spirit scripture just just to tell that women no he's showing here that you're positioning calling is because you a name that's written in the book of inheritance that tells you your position &gt;&gt; as a son of God and under the inspiration this ministry the mother is like a type of the church the woman the the the leadership of God by by the opening of the word natural element utterance of this message of ministry [laughter] anointing on them to preach be unre so and so sister so and so your name is written supernaturally bound by by by denominational teaching you've been bound by a spirit in this world that bounds by a Roman system that that's that's taken the word tried to put their own interpretation on this word comes &gt;&gt; under the anointing of that has received his position and that utterance comes out of his mouth because your name is being called supernaturally your position as a son or a This goes beyond church. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural placing, sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Possessing the land. Now, now that you're in the land, God is saying, "Work. You've been given a land. You've been given a ministry. You've been given a position. It's up to you now. What are you going to plant? What kind of seed are you going to plant? told them that that that they could receive the land of the land. They could bless the land in there. They would eat from that in your land. What are you planting? What what is your ministry producing? Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adoption gives you an inheritance. What inheritance? But with every inheritance comes the the responsibility to take possession position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. Go to the go to the next quote here. Slide 13. It says here God told them way down in Egypt, &gt;&gt; I give you that land. But he didn't say, "I'll go out there and sweep it all out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything. You all just move in." No, no, no. They had to fight for every inch of God that this is just going to be if you're going to stand and you're going to believe the word for your day in control of your life and and the devil ain't going to like your friends aren't going to like you. Your family's not going to like you. They're going to oppose you all the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he says here, he says, "You all just move in." No, no. They had to fight for every inch fighting and take it by every fight, every inch. He said, "Everywhere the souls of your foot are glory to God. Footsteps is possession. That's the same thing it is today. The healing belongs to us that comes with your inheritance. The healing is yours. The spirit belongs. It's our property. You fight every inch of it. Yes. Footsteps is possession. He says just keep fighting. Take it. The devil say the days of miracle is passed. You got situations where miracles. I want you to know that an inherited son of God. Miracles is just an everyday occurrence. You don't you don't go into a situation where I wonder if God's going to heal. God is a miracle working. He doesn't do it according to your season. Your job is to possess the promises them in your life. Amen. But brother footsteps is possession. Just keep on fighting. You're a you're you're a liar. Say to Satan, you're a liar. God said he's the same yesterday and today get over everywhere your footsteps are remember what he said at the beginning be courageous don't be afraid to step out don't be afraid to go to school on being a a daughter or son of God Jesus It's not about going on corners and and dancing and and rebuking the people and telling the people they're going to hell. No, sir. Jesus Christ has come to give life. And that's the life that you're a real Christian people on earth. That's the problem with Christian. You lost your testimony to tell people. &gt;&gt; You should listen. If you don't want to tell them anything, just tell them how happy you are to serve the Lord Jesus Christ about how much you benefit from serving God joy of the Lord. Did you have supernatural strength when you got the joy of God? When you praise God, do you think God needs praise? doesn't need praise. It's not a God that's just sitting there giving me praise. No. God wants you to be the happiest people. You got the joy of the Lord. Praise. You got the joy of God. What's coming out of your mouth God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The reality of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Moses given them all the instructions how to dress the land, how to plant the land, how to rest the land, told them he told them not to mix the inhabitants of the land compromising your promises. &gt;&gt; You do not compromise. You are as an inherited son or daughter of God. Amen. You do not give them any portion of your land. That's your land. Hallelujah. You need to work your land. You need because as you work your land, you start to display the attribute of God. You start to how it is to overcome. You start to show that you're an overcomer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. The Lord said only be courageous. Now you can recall from the scriptures that when the children of Israel and his armies that the people would hold up Moses's arms as long as they held up over the enemy. But did you remember what he said? He says, "My servant Moses is here." It's not about just raising up the dead and saying, "This is the only way. This is the only way you're going to overcome. You're going to win the battle." No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not that. Now Joshua is telling you that you need to possess to receive the Holy Ghost. Brenam was the first wife, the fullness of the word. Father had the Amen. The only way that you're going to the Lord to be an overcomer life need to have. It's got to be Christ in you. food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen here. Watch. Watch &gt;&gt; Joshua. &gt;&gt; He He Joshua had come into his inheritance. &gt;&gt; He had come into his understanding of what God had told him to do. He says, "Just be courageous. I'll be with you. I'll be with you every step of the way." Let's read the next scripture here. He says, "So Joshua descended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor. And the Lord said unto Joshua, fear them not. I have delivered them into thine hand." Listen, I don't care what situation you're facing right now. If you believe God, he's already delivered it into your hand as a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the Lord said unto Joshua, he says, he says, "There shall not a man of them stand before thee." Joshua before therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from Gilgal all night. Now pay attention here. Joshua knew that God was with him. And what is God doing now? has comforted them before Israel slaughter along the way to Beth to unto fighting the battle with them. Who was overcoming with them? &gt;&gt; Yes, you got to overcome. Yes, you got But God is there with you. He's with you. He He's discomforted your enemies because you've accepted your your adoption. You've accepted your position. You know that God is with you. He's going to fight with you. Stay with the word. As long as you stay with your position. Goes on next next uh uh scripture. And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were in the going down to God that the Lord cast down stones from heaven upon them and unto Azeka and they died. Now pay attention. They were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel saw. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you're in the midst of a battle and you're fighting through the battles, all of a sudden there's God is throwing the enemy because because there's an enemy trying to come in from this side over here. Stay focused with the word. Stay with your thoughts. The word of God that's leading you direct stone comes in this enemy. sent that enemy and and there was more &gt;&gt; that died from God's hailstones that you had to deal with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And here now we're looking at adoption. We're looking at a son. We're looking at here at a type of Joshua who's coming into his position. He's trusting God. Are you trusting God tonight? Are you believing that you can stand as a daughter or as a son? He's going to be with you. God, look what he says here. He says in Joshua 10 verse 12 to 14. Then spake Joshua to the Lord. You've got a relationship with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I'll tell you, when you get to a place where you're walking with God, &gt;&gt; you've got God on your side, you've seen some victories in your life, you know that God is fighting some battles for you. I was telling the sister, I said, God will vindicate it. When you receive the Holy Ghost in your life, God will show you things. God will make it real to you that that he will overcome whatever you're facing. Amen. And you get to a place like Joshua where he's got to release the Lord in the day delivery of Israel in the sight of Israel stand. And thou moon stood still avenged. Not this written in still not to go. And there was no day like or after hearkens of a man. Did he say a man? You mean you mean as as a son or a daughter of God? give you the spoken word in you that this is what the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're not just playing church down the road. Now, saints, you're not going to get this kind of this kind of inspiration just to be under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You need to listen. You The Holy Ghost interprets what was on the text. The Holy Ghost interprets the scriptures. Without the Holy Ghost, there is no interpretation. You're just another churchgoer. You're just another Christian that can overcome. You claim to be a Christian and the word is on the left side and claim to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; No sir, we promise you. &gt;&gt; The purpose of God will never bring you into that kind of a life. Praise God. You got a relationship. God wants you as a son to have the maturity on his behalf. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What? This is the hour that we're coming into. Listen, the Lord hearkened under the voice of a man. Why did he do that? Because Joshua believed the Lord. He believed that God was with him. He believed that God would not leave him nor forsake him an impossible situation in his life. You're going to face situations. God's going to put situations going to be impossible there so that you can things all catch the anointing of God. You speak experience as an adopted battles. You've seen God deal with situations in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, he goes on here and read the next quote. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; But God did it anyhow. He says what? &gt;&gt; By a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God, &gt;&gt; not some great angel. Joshua knew he said, "I'm giving you I'm giving you your name. It's yours, sister." He believed it. And when you believe the word, that's why the Holy Ghost comes to himself. He's coming to his own word. cannot return for because you're now confessing it. Father will confess you will be with you. He will confirm the word. Not because you said so, but because he said, he promised. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A man with faith the land. The word of God was give you this land. The souls of your father. It's yours. The steps meant possession. The son is what? Achievement to do. See it was rooted. the sun would ever set them and back upon going down to do this. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You might come into a desperate situation. You trust God. No matter how the enemy looks to be surrounded stand on the promises of Hallelujah. Joshua had a purpose in his life to accomplish for God. The obstacle that God in he say to this mountain because the purpose of the Holy Ghost to overcome that situation situation's got to move because it's God's purpose. &gt;&gt; You're an adopted son. That's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to take it. &gt;&gt; But you see what ended up happening and what ends up happening sometimes with with us &gt;&gt; because we're humans. We get weak sometimes. And in Judges chapter one verse 18 to 19 it says also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof and with the coast thereof and Echron with the coast thereof. The Lord was and he drove out he drove he drove out all the inhabitants of the mountain but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they have of it doesn't matter what the enemy has. We're not to look at the enemies. Majority doesn't mean that that that you can't win. God has always been in a minority. God has always dealt with a few. He always uses the simple. God uses those that believe God. Just look at David. Listen, that Philistine, he comes, he says, "I'm going to take your head off. I'm going to feed you to the doctor because you challenge the living God. I come to you in the name of God, you can tell the enemy in the name of the Lord. In whatever situation, it doesn't matter how you say, I come in the name of the Lord. Hey, I'm going to raise their head. &gt;&gt; That's the authority of a son when they come into their position. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see like today Israel allowed you know the enemy to come into their land. It even mentions Gaza right in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And what does the enemy do? He starts building tunnels. And that's why you got to be careful what you let into your home because the enemy is going to start to pour some tunnels under your bed. You know those you know those pornographic uh magazines? You got to be careful. They try to get they try to get buried into your into your under your bed and and and that's how the enemy works. Amen. Come on. We're talking about the realities here. We're talking we're talking how the enemy works. Amen. But we're not to compromise with the enemy. Oh, well, nobody nobody knows about it. Nobody knows because, you know, when I go to church, you know, I I'm there. I'm all dressed up. I look good. I say, "Praise the Lord." But then when I leave church, no, no, God knows all about it. And because that thing is sitting there, you're anointing your power to overcome your ability to to possess your sunship to combine the power of the enemy is. Why? Because you've made compromise with the enemy. Not to compromise with the enemy. You know that the children of Israel, they they went and made tributes. The Bible said, I you know, I don't have the scripture, but they went and made tributes. Okay? They were afraid of their big chariot. So, they said, "Listen, we're going to let you stay in the land, but we're still the boss. We're still the boss, but we're going to let you stay in the land as long as you as long as you do what we tell you. You think Satan is going to listen to you? You think he's just going to sit there in your in your social media? that you've got your password on that nobody else but you can &gt;&gt; and you think that you're going to hide that. No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Amen. You don't make any You don't make any tributaries with the enemy. Amen. You You just fight. You continue to fight. When you feel you can't do anymore, just get back up and fight. You're going to see a boulder come from the left. comfort. Come from the front. God is going to fight your battles. Keep pressing through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. The Lord is reminding us that we are sometimes going to get discouraged, but we're never to give up. We are sons and daughters of the King. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We are going to display the word in this hour that will overcome everything that the enemy is trying to throw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's go to the to the next slide here. &gt;&gt; In John chapter 15, &gt;&gt; I want to remind us now. We're going to wind this down. Amen. God He says here, "Ye have not chosen me." So don't put this on, oh I decided to give my heart to Jesus. You need to understand here because you have not chosen me. I have chosen you. You were in my mind before the foundations of the world. He says, he says, "And ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, you may give it he he may give it to you." &gt;&gt; Man doesn't search for God. this adoption that we're talking about that you're predestinated unto predestin I'm I'm not here to tell you oh hey you can become an adopted son that's not what I've been speaking here tonight no sir if your name's in that book of inheritance you're hearing something here you're you're hearing something totally you're when you read this scripture now you understand that you didn't choose you. Oh, I had to I had to give up all these things. I chose God. I I decided to go to the altar. No, no. That's why you go to camp meetings year after year. You go to the altar and then for the rest of the year, you're back in the world. is because you haven't recognized that you've got a father that has your name written in his book of inheritance and that he chose you before you came into this. This is weak. This is going to fight you when you leave here tonight. You're going to have to overcome this thing next week when you go to school or when you when you go to work or whatever you're going to deal with. But you need this revelation of understanding. You did not choose. You chose Lord. &gt;&gt; He goes on here. Now read the let's go to the next quote here in adoption chapter 4. He says it. Now this may just choke you. &gt;&gt; But did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? &gt;&gt; He didn't just listen. He chose you to be a manifested sonif. &gt;&gt; But did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? How many ever know that? How many knows that Jesus said so? That the Bible Jesus said, "Do not your law say itself that ye are gods." And if you call them gods, which they were because they were, they had full do domain over the dominion of the world. Talking about Adam here. Amen. Talking about the first Adam here. Give him dominion over all things. He lost his godship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That book of inheritance was lost right at the very beginning. That's why this book of inheritance is only going to be revealed when the sons of God are manifested because they carry the names. Hallelujah. Listen. He says and he lost his godship. He lost his sunship. He lost his domain. brother waiting for the manifestation of God to come back to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Did you Did you hear what he said there? We're waiting for the take over for the fullness of time. Remember scripture in Ephesians chapter 1. In the fullness of time, he's going to take everything that's in heaven. all those sons and daughters of God, the Old Testament, all the way through the end of that seventh church age. And any saint of God that dies now goes right directly to the sixth dimension. They're waiting and groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God to carry the mystery. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You mean you mean we've got a big part to do with all this? Oh yes, sir. You might think you're just 18 years old, but if you're hearing what I'm saying and there's something inside of you, let our heart burn within us along the way because there's representation of God. He says here, "But brother, we are waiting for the son of God. come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time but this is not the age of the love that's why don't be and you know listen we know what we believe &gt;&gt; we just preach the word that the that the anointing of the Holy Ghost gives us if there's somebody that's out there. See, he's trying to convince you to listen to the tapes. Prophet, you need to come to one of my services. I quote the prophet. I listen to the tapes every single day. I've got an understanding has manifested sons in the last days that have a portion that they got to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham fulfilled Moses is dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's a Joshua commission. &gt;&gt; There's a Revelations 108 commission this week. Amen. The pyramid gets full sons of God. Hallelujah. Take every Satan's God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It belongs to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to take every power that Satan &gt;&gt; is trying to Listen, if Satan's trying to stop one of your brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; I want you to know tonight. You're a manifested son of God. If you come into this understanding, &gt;&gt; you can you can go after your brothers and sisters.

Every single one of them. You can't stop it. I can't stop. He is going to call them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. It belongs to him. We're winding down here. Give me a few more minutes. Okay. &gt;&gt; Let's read our next scripture. &gt;&gt; You might think, if the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the spirit? But now have God set the members, every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him. &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose. You're in this church here in in De Mo for a purpose. &gt;&gt; God put you here. You might have been going here. You might have been going there. You might have been in this in this state and in that state, but then all of a sudden you come under the anointed word under the pastor that God has ordained. He's a he's a he's an attribute of a cluster of attributes that went out from God. You were part of that cluster. You got to be under him. &gt;&gt; You'll only get fed under him. I come to realize that years ago when I come under John Simon. &gt;&gt; All I could hear when he was preaching the word was that you're a son. &gt;&gt; You're an adopted son. You've got you've got a position in. You're called for a purpose. Hallelujah. You're called to that eternal purpose. And all you could do was say, "Amen." And just keep going forward. I got a revelation on tithing. I was tithing for because when I caught that revelation on tithing, it kicked poverty out of my life. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Cuz I came to realize that Jehovah Gyra is my provider because because I'm a son of God. I I I take it serious. &gt;&gt; You either believe God or you don't. You want to believe God or you don't. God is Jehovah. You can't wait to pay your tithe. You need to make an offering. But the prophet listen God said in Malachi me. He didn't say try your pastor. He didn't say try the deacons. He said try me and see if I don't open the windows of heaven on you, the promises of God. that comes with being a son of God. Have you authority in your life? Poverty has no room in my life because Jehovah Gyra is my provider. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. He says here in adoption one, he says, "Now, who could doubt that?" &gt;&gt; That's what Paul said. That's scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church, &gt;&gt; the church positionally before the foundations of the world. When God in his labor pain was bringing forth you, &gt;&gt; knowing what you would do, he positionally placed you into his own body. Now listen here to be a housewife. Oh my. You mean you can be a housewife positionally placed by God with the authority of the authority to kick this devil out of your children's life. Hallelujah. Glory to God. To be a farmer, &gt;&gt; to be a preacher, &gt;&gt; to be a prophet, to be placed you perceptionally. He knew what you were going to do. He knew that you would accept this message. You accept this word. Listen. He goes on. He says, "Then did you notice Moses the next one?" He says, "That great miracle performer that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not place their inheritance to them. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't place them. &gt;&gt; It's not the tapes that are going to place you. It's God himself. &gt;&gt; It was John. Listen, he's saying it right here. He says he brought them but but he did not give them their inheritance. &gt;&gt; He led them up to the land but not divided. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession to them to give to them to cross. Oh, hallelujah. It's listen, you know that capstone and you know from the seven church ages there's a gap there. It's going to take the Holy Ghost to get you over that to bring you into that capstone. It's not going to be like anoint the Holy Ghost in our mortal from this dimension. Hallelujah. And Christ brought the church It was given to them. But the Holy Spirit is the one listen who sets the church in order. Joshua of today puts the church in its order giving to each one gift. And now listen. And he is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; He is the voice of God. Holy Ghost is the voice of God. Amen. That's that that that that's speaking to the man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Saints of God, have we come into the reality of God? &gt;&gt; And in closing, I want to say this. adoption too. Brother Brandon, he says, "In this promised land that we've been talking about here tonight, everything belongs to us." &gt;&gt; In the promised land, &gt;&gt; see it, Brother Collins.
