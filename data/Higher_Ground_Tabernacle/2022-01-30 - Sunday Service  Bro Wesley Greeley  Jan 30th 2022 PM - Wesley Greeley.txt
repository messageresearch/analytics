believers [Music] [Music] may you push it back [Music] [Music] would you hide your servants today [Music] [Applause] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ i bring you greetings from our home church in alabama brother shelly in all of the congregation i am brother wesley greeley wesley my sweet wife sister joyce is with me and sister josie i'm so grateful that she is traveling with me this time if you have your bibles i would like to read from first kings chapter 19 um i would like to wish your pastor a very happy birthday [Applause] it's my honor to be here preaching for him on this his birthday weekend first kings chapter 19. don't worship what i'll read verse 9 and then brother you can read it and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah elia eternally addressed may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seed let's give a little background here how elijah got to this particular place elijah was the prophet of the lord but he was still the prophet of the lord and it was during the during the reign of ahab the king at the time was ahab the ones who don't like the account and the bible said that as he come to reign that he did worse than all of the kings that were before him and as we look at the history of the kings sometimes we wonder how a man could get any worse than a previous one but the bible said he did more wickedly than all of the previous kings of israel now there was a lot of wickedness that had gone on before and there was a previous king by the name of jeroboam and he was afraid of losing his congregation to jerusalem jerusalem so he decided that he was going to create a place in the northern part of the country i believe it was in the city of dan and he set up a place for the people to worship now god's provided place of worship was in jerusalem and so he decided to set up an idol in the city of damn and it was not to worship the one true living god it became it didn't matter the hardships to get there place of worship was in jerusalem there was a man who was afraid of losing his congregation and so he set up idle worship of the one true god but they weren't under the blessing of almighty god [Music] and we will be in the same position my friend if we try to come up with a substitute that jezebel did not realize that elijah was her pastor and we come up with a substitute for the worship and we come up with a substitute for our pastor we will find ourselves under the same false and it begins and he did worse than all of those that were before him now we may think how could he do any worse than setting up idle worship but the bible jezebel was the daughter of a king and she was a baal worshiper also so now not only do we have a king who is a baal worshiper he has strengthened his alliance to that worship and not only that she was stronger willed than ahab and now ahab might have been the king the people may have looked at him as the authority but [Music] when we see this kind of a picture we become a little bit disconcerted we get uncomfortable in alignment because he has an end plan the one that started this process he knows the very end of all of it he could never understand all of and it is my job to get in lockstep with my creators and there is all kinds of atrocities that are going on what he set out to accomplish and and all of the baal worship is going on he says i want you to meet me with all of the prophets of baal [Music] so the land is getting pretty dry like lupine the shrubbery is drying up the sushi the grass is drying up the crops are not producing the people are no doubt getting hungry and they're trying to figure out where they're going to find their next bottle of water maybe when they put the jug down in the well they pull it up and it's dry and you're just longing for a good cold drink of water god knows how to get you in that tight place until that you reversal until you will respond to his cause you may and he knows how to make you so dry and you have nowhere else to turn and he finally has you in the right position so elijah had called for this drought and he said there will be no rain not even he says i want you to bring all of the prophets of baal i want you to bring [Music] this is gonna be a real meeting we're going to have all of them have to be there this is going to be a school of the prophets and elijah calls all of them up on top and he says make sure you bring your sacrifices when they get up on top of the mountain elijah [Music] we're gonna have a showdown once and for all spectacular and we're going to decide who is the real god so they set up their sacrifice and they began to dance around that sacrifice and i imagine early in the morning they're probably joining hands around this sacrifice they're dancing around he's having a little trouble and then he says maybe he's off in a far country somewhere you know elijah was just taunting them [Music] he was fixing to do something to show his power [Music] it comes toward the time of the evening sacrifices and i don't know whether elijah felt sorry for them or not i don't really i don't really think that he did because he kept poking at them he might have been saying well that didn't work why don't you try something else that didn't work why don't you try something else and see that's the way people you may go after women [Music] so but after a while elijah knew enough was enough i see and elijah got his sacrifice he said bill build the altar back up he should lay the bullock on top of that altar because this was a time of a it's a draft of a drought do this decision and i want to know where they got the water but elijah said fill up those pails with water now i don't know how far they had to go get their buckets of water but there was some water to pour over that sacrifice and it didn't satisfy elijah for them to just fill their buckets one time that didn't satisfy me said go do it again this was not just going to be some little something there god was about to show himself god when you get to the bottom of yourself god can show [Music] and he's got his sacrifice he's got a ditch [Music] he's poured water on top of it not only is the sacrifice went [Applause] sacrifices [Music] i beseech you therefore brethren present yourselves unto god a living sacrifice sacrifice be holy and acceptable unto god it's not unreasonable for god to ask you to be a living sacrifice when the [Music] the enemy here i am lord and he's got his sacrifice on the altar and now the wood's he's just going to let the people know who god is first of all and he stands before that sacrifice he lifts up his head and he said oh lord i thank you that you've heard me and it didn't matter that the sacrifice was wet you know it didn't matter that the wood was wet sacrifices [Applause] and i tell you what the fire of the holy ghost is if you allow the fire of the holy ghost to consume you oh food it will be burned so hard in you that all of those fleshly desires you may say preacher where have you been presenting yourself have you been presenting yourself up and dan are you coming to god's provided place of worship but we spend too much time in dance [Music] without the that god is not going to accept [Music] there are many people and they listen with an intellectual mind when we present ourselves as a living sacrifice and he will come and consume us this is not a once a week happening we have got to come to our lord daily lord burn out all of the uncleanness burn out all of the stuff that is hindering me but we get scared we get scared because we're afraid of losing friendships we're but at the end of the day what does it matter because i don't answer to my peers i have one that i answered and that is the one that called me my lord jesus christ so elijah is at this showdown the fire came down and consumed the sacrifices of sacrifice that it not only absorbed the sacrifice and it absorbed the wood and it absorbed the water but how did it absorb the stones absorbing there have been a lot of things that i have tried to present to god and there have been a lot of times that he has turned what i thought was important to me but he had a calling on my life that he wanted to carry out now you may say preacher that don't exactly fit it doesn't matter right this second yeah because sometimes we come to god um here is my gift to you lord but do you realize how hard you're making it on me god isn't looking for excuses god is looking for a sacrifice a sacrifice that is brought to him out of a grateful heart that he went to calvary on your behalf and he laid down his life that you could have eternal life he doesn't so all of the excuses that i present to him i but all of this sacrifice that elijah had presented to god is now ash it is and now ahab has watched all of this transpire transformation he saw his own prophets of baal dancing around their altar and no response from baal but the report you've got to remember elijah and ahab have already butted heads god comes down and consumes elijah's sacrifice and they all watched it happen every last one of them now there is no record in the scripture that one of those prophets of baal fell down on their knees and repented and i am sure that those four hundred and fifty prophets of baal jesus christ were not ignorant that there was a prophet of the living god in the language i imagine that when they gathered together at the school of the baal prophets that elijah's name was mentioned more than one time [Music] i have a feeling that elijah's name was batted from one side of the room to the other side and they probably talked about that crazy guy that lives in the wilderness but here they are on top of the mountain and they have just watched an incredible feat of the living god the spectacle in response to elijah god's prophet and not one of them bowed down and said he is god and elijah said you take every last one of them and you kill them don't let none of them escape you read further in the scripture i don't know where that elijah heard the sound elijah went apart from the rest of them with that elijah knew something was about to happen and he made a prophetic declaration but he had to go pray that declaration through [Music] he said i want you to go look and see what you see look toward the sea and tell me what's there the servant comes back and says i don't see a thing because [Music] continues to intercede and see that's the way it is among a congregation of people a preacher may stand here and tell you i believe god is going to do this this and this is what the preacher needs is some prayer warriors to sit down beside of him and put their head between their knees and begin to cry out with god see this isn't all the preacher's job to do he needs some intercessors to be possible say lord send the reigns on that lord well what's happening today because successors will do and all we can present is like the servant i don't see nothing all i see around me is trials i see that there are things that it looks like america's about to crash i see that people come to church and they don't care whether they're there or not [Music] i hear the sound of an abundance of rain the old testament doesn't record that but jesus told us in the new testament that it was a space of three and a half years that elijah prayed but it was his prophecy that shut up the heavens and it was his prophecy that brought the reign back and he prayed it through [Music] and there was a supernatural force that came on elijah the prophet and he began to run and the bible said that he got there ahead of ahab [Music] but it is not going to come to us [Music] [Applause] bless us if you can say this the job of the preacher this is a body ministry [Applause] we are to come into the house of the lord with expectations don't expect evil sorry brother brooks i'm gonna say it ahead of you there are a lot of people that come into the church with we need to come to the house of god and it's going to change our lives i don't care how low you feel like you have sunk if you will with a right heart come into the house of the lord i know that i have sinned against you this week and i have found myself in the muck of sin but lord i know my only help is when you come in the house of the lord and he wants to come and put his hand on top of your head and he wants to say son with your fee sir you've [Applause] i'm not going to the house of the lord just sit on my hands my and i know that baal worship is not what he's going to accept that'll make you want to say yes lord i know i'm the one that allowed myself to get in that hell but i come to you with a holy [Music] [Applause] the lord is not here to kick you this is the only place you gotta pull [Music] you say brother i find myself in fornication i find myself in adultery i find myself in pornography i but we can boil them all down to one [Music] my god is able to consume the sacrifice but you've got to present the sacrifice to him lord here i am [Music] he knows who you are you can go out of this house today and you can keep all of your excuses in your pockets because after god came down and consumed that sacrifice after the mighty prophet of god had his head between his knees and prayed for rain [Music] and gave jezebel the report of the revival meeting now elijah was under the mighty hand of god remember the fire came down and consumed the sacrifice and after elijah prayed for the rain there came a supernatural power on elijah that he ran ahead of ahab um something supernatural was upon there was the supernatural fire that consumed the sacrifice and the supernatural was upon him to run but the report of the revival the report of the supernatural got back to jezebel naturally when he got back to the i tell you the jezebel spirit has not died and it presents itself in all kinds of ways and i'm not here to define all of those ways today all i know is that that ahab he ran to the city under the supernatural but when ahab got back with the report and he gave the ahab did they he gave the report to jezebel jezebel had a report to send back to elijah you're going to be just like one of those prophets of baal at now we all have our mountaintop experiences [Music] are there any believers here today that you would testify i have had mountain topics but how many of you believers that have had mountain mountaintop experiences would say that you face the jezebel afterwards all elijah got was a jezebel report [Music] it didn't change his position in god he was still the prophet of god but jezebel sent word to him foreign it didn't matter that the supernatural had just happened he left his servant there and the bible said he checked another three days journey into the wilderness and he went and hid in a cave the mighty he comes down under a juniper tree juniper and he goes to sleep in italy he wakes up because angel tapped him on the shoulder um drank says you got to rise up and eat that angel food must have been something supernatural because in the strength of that he went in he went 40 days journey and the voice of the lord comes to him amen what are you doing here you see he has witnessed the supernatural even over and over again and now he is in this cave running from the jezebel spirit and god asks in this question what are you doing here and what did elijah did elijah starts offering his excuses as to why he's there [Music] and they're doing all kinds of things against your words and i'm the only one that's standing for any truth he goes back in the cave and there is a supernatural power that went there was a wind that went through see all of these things that precede the voice of the lord [Music] elijah hears the voice of god elijah what are you doing here you see they lied to you again lord senora i have been very jealous for your people i've been jealous for you lord and all of israel has forsaken you and they have forsaken your covenants and they've torn down your altars and they've erected altars under baal and i am the only one left and they're seeking to take me out god had to come along to elijah jude and remind him you are not the only one you see when you are in the valley of despair when you are in your hellhole and you feel like that nobody understands who you are perhaps you have laid at this altar and experienced the touch of god in your life and you had a mountaintop experience [Music] you went to try to find something that would satisfy you but we don't live our life on a mountaintop experience god gives you those mountaintop experiences because he knows that you're going to face some jezebel spirit so that you can face jezebel and he rents the mountain into he tears the mountain apart yeah he explodes the mountain and and and he he sends win and he and hear that still small voice of the lord you see the mind battle friends it rages all of the time and it seems like that our head is just going to explode but sometimes we just got to settle ourselves to hear the voice of the lord [Music] i gave you the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] i saved you out of a life of sin i am the same god who sent fire out of heaven i am the same god who put a supernatural energy inside of you so that you could run ahead of ahab into jerusalem what are you doing here have you forgotten who i am this is not your force anyhow this you're this is not by might it's not by power but it's by my spirit saith the lord of hosts what are you doing here why are you in this valley of despair today why are you in this condition have you forgotten what i have done previous to now [Music] i'm the same god that did this supernatural in you to start with well i want to tell you you sitting here is a supernatural happening it is above the natural natural you say well how do you figure i live in this region but you think about all of the millions of people you think about all of the people that billy graham ever will preach too and they made a decision yes i want christ but that's all they did but here you sit today [Music] by a supernatural happening god put you in the right family with the right upbringing he took you through the right struggles he put you in the right school with the right parents and the right teachers and somewhere along the way he brought you to another one of those junctions of time that you recognized your day and its visitation [Music] [Music] i am a sinner jesus i have fallen so short of your grace but i ask you to forgive me of all of my sins to demonstrate it was still a supernatural happening in your life and said what are you doing here don't you know that i'm still the god of the supernatural you're not the only one you're not the only one that has faced battles you're not the only one that has ever had a mind battle you're not the only one that has ever encountered the jezebel spirit he's still in the cave offering his excuses to the lord you may say preacher are you really sure that that's what was happening here i believe that that is what was happening because elijah was a prophet but he was a human and we do find it recorded in the scripture we can witness the same thing to the in the prophet of our day experiment he was not god he was a prophet he was a man he had the truth to give to the people i have found myself under the juniper tree [Music] some kind of a tormenting spirit had gotten after him and he needed a rest and there are times that we need arrest but i want to tell you young people and i want finds their and sometimes i have to pull sometimes what my wife has to say the first group i'm going to turn that right around because sometimes she has just the right words god gave her to me because sometimes i need to be kicked in the side of the head to remind me i've reserved unto myself seven thousand you're not the only one that has ever faced discouragement get so i struggle a long little longer i don't want something as natural as my wife to tell me something i want fire to come out of heaven again i want the supernatural to come upon me that i can and sometimes it's just a still small boy how did you get yourself in this place you think you're the only i am not so far removed from being a teenager and a young man that i don't understand some of the struggles i also realized that you all are facing something that i never faced because of this thing right here of course you said chosen [Music] that those things that are done in secret faith they're of the lord jesus christ you're not hiding a thing you are not hiding one thing from the living god but i know a savior [Applause] [Music] the holy spirit is here today saying to you who i have shown you the way before i am the one that called you supernaturally when you were dead in your sin and in your trespasses without you begin to weep in the presence of the lord [Music] say oh lord i'm a sinner but here you are again running from the presence of the lord the lord asks you the question again today what are you doing here now you've got to give the lord a response and i want you to think about your response as we come down to a close up and the musicians come to the instrument i want you to think about your response [Music] some higher than others [Music] whether you feel like that you're in the depths of despair [Music] if you're on a mountaintop experience the holy spirit is saying what are you doing here do you think you've arrived you don't think you have to press any further than this [Music] [Music] [Music] i want you to hear the still small voice of the holy spirit what are you doing [Music] you say well there's nothing i can do about it [Music] i'm the only one left i don't have the power to fight against that jezebel spirit [Music] the holy spirit is here today to empower you like never before [Music] get up out of that place [Music] [Music] and you hear his voice he asks you what are you doing here he's not asking you [Music] because he wants you to remain there [Music] [Music] close your eyes [Music] and i know that you're dealing with the hearts of the people and you're asking them what are you doing in this condition what are you doing here i have showed you the supernatural before i have pulled you out of a place of discouragement before i'm here to do it once again i want you to respond to the holy ghost today if you feel that you're in a low place and you just need a visitation of the holy spirit want you to step out of your seat [Music] i want you to come and stand up around this platform today and we're gonna pray for you here's one is there another you hear the response you hear the voice of the lord here i am lord what do you do here i am [Music] you tell the lord i don't want to stay here [Music] and he's always there to accuse you he stands there with his arm cross what are you doing [Music] but when the voice of the lord comes to you and he says what are you doing here it's because he has a remedy for the place that you're in and he wants to pull you up out of that hole that you're in so every one of you that have responded and you're standing here with me today i [Music] i want you to make a posture toward the lord i don't want no half-hearted response i want you to respond to the holy ghost in a different way than you usually respond if you usually lift your hands up halfway i want you to raise them up a little bit further i want you to make a declaration to the lord i'm not coming with a half-hearted response i'm not coming in the same way [Music] [Music] i'm asking your holy spirit [Music] and i've allowed jezebel to push me down [Music] and i'm lifting my hands [Music] i'm tired of this place that [Music] i am now praying over these your children you see as they have responded to the power of the holy ghost and here they stand lord if i see you so they've lifted their hands and with their voice but i pray [Music] that there would be a responding to the supernatural thank god that they would hear the still small boys of the living god i say to that jezebel spirit [Music] i say to that accusatory spirit i say shut up in the name of jesus christ shut up in the name of jesus christ you go back accuser you go back where you came from i lift up my hands into the presence of the living god and i say i hear the voice of the lord once more and i'm responding to the voice of the living god [Music] i say hear the voice of the living god today oh spirit of the living god friends i can't do [Music] the lord is heavier than we can carry sometimes i feel like we can't go on the lord i lift my eyes please [Music] you that are stronger you that are still in your seats i want you to lift your hands toward things that are standing here i want you to help me with you because every once in a while that's good [Music] we've been told [Music] that elijah's equal vision is [Music] but the holy spirit [Music] you've already found your place you that are not standing here around this altar [Music] and we want to strengthen the hand of faith of these [Music] [Music] holy spirit i pray that you will fall right now fall in this house [Music] i received [Music] and now i know he touched me [Music] i was [Music] that shame [Music] [Music] touched me [Music] don't you give up don't you give up [Music] don't you let that jezebel spirit say there's nothing for me [Music] i take authority over that in the name of jesus christ you press in a little bit harder [Music] you say lord i'm not leaving until you bless me i'm not going anywhere [Music] [Music] blessings [Music] i i shall never cease to see [Music] oh [Music] something happened and now oh and now i know that jesus touched me and he made since i met this place me i shall never see too crazy oh she touched me [Music] the oh that flesh my soul now i know [Music] oh [Music] [Music] all the intellectual part god all that stuff that he thought he knew through intellectual i pray god that by the holy spirit he would be so destroyed today in the name of jesus christ and that you would let the power of the living god come down

of the wind [Music] [Music] that the angels would be there first to clean up all the mess these dogs would just pick up all the pieces there would not be one thing that would be able to be used to be once again launched against my brother beyonce [Music] refreshing from the presence [Music] oh [Music] [Music] you see once upon a time there was a battle [Music] and moses had given the instruction when he gave the instruction he stood up on a rock and he held his hands up as long as his hands were being held up the people were winning the battle but as his hands began to get heavy the battle was raging but moses's hands got heavy felt like he couldn't hold him up anymore but there were some men that got under his arms they realized that there was a man called of god and that he had a job to do and that his hands had to be held up in order for the victory to be won so they got under his arms they held his arms up and so as a prophetic symbol today these two men this weekend that have led the song service and helped to create the atmosphere for the word of god they're standing here beside of their pastor holding his arms up in a prophetic declaration lord i am here to support my brother because we are in a war and it is a war that we have got to win and if the man of god falls down [Music] the the the army is going to be defeated but if we hold up the arms of god's servant going to win this fight so now lord as these brothers stand on both sides of my brother isaiah brooks i declare over him word of the lord once again it is not my might it is not by power but it is by the spirit of the lord now lord i i am laying my hands on these [Music] that they would understand [Music] and not only as they stand behind holding up the arms of our brother god i pray for this may
