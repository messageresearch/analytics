com amen um let's sing this song um in the city where the lamp is the light I'm going to sing that in French but um I put the English translation there [Music] spee [Music] [Music] c c [Music] oh [Music] de C [Music] C for [Music] City C [Music] City C City [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] City fore [Music] [Applause] [Music] city [Music] city for [Music] amen amen I like that song because it's a prom that's that's why we're trying to live a Christian Life you know we Abraham was looking forward to that City you know and and we have the promise that one day we'll all get to that City you just have to believe and as we stand I want to greet youall in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh let's open our Bible in the book of Acts chapter one oh yeah chapter one starting with the fourth verse and I'll start and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the king om to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power you know but ye shall receive power after the after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and onto the uttermost part of the earth I'm going to read verse eight again but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you so first the Holy Ghost comes upon you and then you receive power and then that makes you a witness because he says and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and onto the uttermost part of the earth so that means even Iowa you can be a witness of the Gospel all right let's uh read uh John chapter 4 uh John chapter 4 let's start at the 25th verse the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things and Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he verse 27 and upon this upon this came his disciples and Marvel that he talked with a woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and said to the man come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this to Christ so this woman was also a witness that God keeps his word and when she realized that God kept his word she went to witness to testify and verse 30 says then they went out of the city and came unto him um May the Lord add the blessing to reading of his word let's bow our head real quick dear heavenly father Lord Jesus we love you so much Lord because you've been so good to us father Lord we don't ever want to take it for granted together in your house house this morning on this Sunday morning Lord Jesus because we know father that because we know father that one of these days the the door the church doors will be closed Lord J Heavenly Father Lord God and we just want to thank you for the time that we have to to come and worship you together and father we know that we are not here alone Lord Jesus because you you made an appointment with us Lord you made an appointment that wherever two or three are gathered in your name father that you shall be in the midst of and your prophet in this last age told us that you always keep all your appointment Lord we thank you for keeping your appointment this morning Lord we just read the Bible Lord and father the Bible says that this the letter kill us but the spirit gives life Heavenly Father Lord we can't read this just uh just because we know how to read but but only you can give us the Revelation Lord Lord I commit myself into your hand Lord I Surrender myself you know I depend on you 100% Lord Jesus father Lord because I myself I'm not a preacher I don't know how to preach but I trust you to be the great preacher Lord and I I pray that you hear through the congregation Lord Jesus and that this sermon may be a blessing to them Lord Jesus bless your word and I commit the service to you and may you take every Spirit under your control in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats and I'll continue reading this uh verse I'll skip to verse 39 and he says and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever I did so an entire city believed on a testimony of a woman and verse 40 so when the samarit were come unto him they they besought him that he would ter with them and he there two days and many more believed because of his of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world uh the title of this of the topic this morning is going to be um witnesses that God keeps his word being witnesses that God is always faithful to his word because many people questions if many people even question if God is real even in this church right now there could be someone you prayed for something and you wondered if God is even real if he answer your prayer and I'm here to encourage you this morning to reassure you that God keeps his word you know and I don't even know if this is going to be preaching or me just talking to you and throughout the topic I'll be giving a few testimonies so we read the book of I preached this sermon by the way last Sunday in Iowa City and I thought it it would be a blessing if I preach it and so in the book of Acts we read that Jesus want us to be Witnesses Witnesses of what w Witnesses of the Resurrection what is the purpose of the res Resurrection is to show us that God is still alive it's to show us that that the same God who made himself flesh and died on the cross he did not just stay on the cross but he rose again you know and everything that God does there's always a purpose behind it you know I wonder why did God have needed Witnesses because he he could have just Rose and just let continue he with with his purpose but he told the disciples that he wanted them to be Witnesses because in every age the spirit of the enemy will always try to discredit the word of God Even in our generation even today there there's this one group of people that try to discredit the message of the they try to to to show all sort of proofs to to discredit the work of God and remember the prophet said that Spirits don't die that same spirit it's not a new spirit because I saw that in the Bible when Jesus rose from the dead there were two people that were watching over the body of Jesus in the in the grave and when the angel of the Lord came down those two people were Witnesses of it and they knew that Jesus they knew that Jesus rose from the dead he wasn't in a grave no more and they knew that they weren't sleeping the whole time they heard they had their eyes open so they took the body of but when they went to the high priest the high priest told them to make to to come up with a lie to discredit to discredit the word of God the high priest told them to say that uh uh that the disciples came and stole the body of Jesus Christ you know Satan is never going after what's what's what's fake he always goes after what's real and and the prophet says that to this day people still believe the lie it's in the message Paradox the prophet says that they still believe that and he says but we believe and know by his living presence now that he raised from the dead and is here with us now I repeat that again but we believe and know by his living presence now that he raised up from the dead and he's here with us now but my question to you is do you believe that and I'm not talking about sympathizing because because I say that God is real because brother Brook says that God is real because the Bible says that he rose from the dead because brother Bram says that God is real but how how do you know that God is real how do you know that God rose from the dead because you you you have to be Witnesses and and and the definition of a witness according to the to the US Department of Justice it says that a witness is a person who saw or heard the crime take place or may have important information about the crime or the defendant [Music] both the defense and the prosecutor can call witnesses to testify and tell what they know about the situation and brother Bram also uses the same definition in the message Witnesses he says that in order to be a witness you have to do two things you have to either um um hear about the matter or you have you ought to see that so in other words you have to have a personal experience you cannot just you can't just come and tell me that uh even if you go to the court system you cannot be a witness based on what other people are saying you cannot say that this message is real based on what I preached it has to be a personal experience because that's how you overcome the devil being a witness that's my topic for today God wants us to be witness Even in our in our community God wants us to be with because the only way the world will see Jesus is through you that's why Jesus says that the works that I do you shall do Greater Works because the the prophet says that in the in the New Testament Jesus he was just one man doing all the works but now through the Holy Ghost he he he he he he poured himself onto multiple people being a witnesses that God is real even in your schools young people and I'm going to talk specifically to the sisters like the sisters going like in in in American schools here wearing skirts every day to school is a witness because when you dress you never put makeups you always wear skirts and dresses those people will will ask themselves questions why are you always that way and I'm here to tell tell you to not be ashamed of it I'm here to tell you that that that that if you are ashamed of God here he's going to be ashamed of you on the other you need you need to you need to to take a stand for the word of God that's why I have a lot of respect for sisters when they always dress modest because I like I said I'll be giving a lot of testimonies throughout my sermon I personally went when I came to the US I I I back seed I wasn't a Christian anymore and I remember when my sisters came from the Congo they came to the US and I remember we went somewhere I think it was at the immigration place and we took a family picture and I told them um okay you guys can post this picture but don't tag me in this picture because I was embarrassed of having sisters that were dress I thought that it was ugly you know and and and I know there are some young people even you leave the house with a skirt but when you go to school you change you wear your pants you that's why I I always tell parents you need to always pray for your your children because you are not always with them everywhere they are when I came to the US my parents weren't with me I was alone I was alone in high school I could do whatever I wanted to that's why you need to pray for them because you you can you cannot control them everywhere they are but I know one person who sees everything is God so if you put it back in the hands of God he's going to take care of Amen going back to the woman at the well she was a woman you know and but she she went to convert an entire city so sisters you may not be able to preach at the pulpit but you can still be a witness because the prophet said I'll rather have a man that leaves me his sermon than preach me a sermon so a better a better preacher is someone who leaves what he [Music] preaches and PR and preacher can be the way you leave the way you carry yourself with your husband at home the way you carry yourself in the workplace you don't compromise for the word of God in this leodan church age God is looking for Witnesses this is a an age where there's a lot of evil evil in in the land and the prophet says that God has always kept himself with a witness in every generation God has always had a witness my question to you I challenge you to be that witness this morning when God speaks to you don't try to to point to other people but let it be to yourself Lord I Want To Be A Witness and this morning God wants to remind you that he's faithful to his word God wants to remind you that you can bring all your burdens and all your cares to him and he's going to take care of Amen amen and talking about the woman there was a woman um uh in the prophet talks about this one woman she was alcoholic I mean she had a husband that was alcoholic I think some of you remember that story and there was a challenge the prophet says that people were asking they were saying that there in this day and age we there there's no more Christians that and I hear that the Lord even even other sisters sometime they get so discouraged by seeing how what message Brothers call themselves [Music] brothers and they start questioning they say that I already some even say I rather marri someone outside the message and remember remember the prophet says that Satan will always point you to what's what's false but it's never going to point you to the real one there are some people out there in the world they just see you claiming to be a message believer but you behave just like them so how are they going to come to come to the message if they see that there's no difference with your life and their life they do the same thing that you do you guys get together and you drink together and yet you want a witness to that person to come to your church when even being a Salesman when you're trying to sell something to someone you got to show to the person that whatever I have is is something that you don't care the only way that even even around your friends you can only influence them if you have something that they don't have amen and God is calling you to be Witnesses so that woman she um so the the husband says that when when all his friends were saying that they we don't have any Christians in the world said but I know one I know one person who is a Christian and he said it's my wife and they decided to go test to see if she was a real Christian and every true every true witness will always be tested it's not enough to just say I'm a Christian with your mouth but you got to do that with your life it's not enough to say I'm a message believer but you got to prove it with your life so they went back home and uh they pretended to be drunk and uh when they came home they asked the wife he asked his wife to make food for him and the prophet says that they were just acting like drunk drunk people they were stering and all that and then the wife still kept her sweet nature and she went to make food for for her husband and her drunk friend and his drun friend you know so sisters it doesn't matter how your husband how bad your husband is you still have to be a [Music] wife even if your husband is not even if your husband is not a message believer you still need to be a wife because the prophet says that that woman she At first she was she was converted and after she was converted then her husband was not converted yet and when they brought the the food and then he took the food and just like threw it on the floor and he started complaining the prophet says that the wife still kep kept sweet and she said I'm sorry my husband that I didn't know you wanted the food to be prepared a certain way she said I'll go make I'll go make something else but the husband kept ridiculing the wife in front of his friends and when they were doing all that the woman started singing must Jesus carry his cross alone and then the the prophet said that one of the friends said that she's a real Christian and then the prophet says that him the husband and all his friends gave their heart to God that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he also want us to be Witnesses you know in this church other people need to see the don't just complain that there's no fire in the church but let the fire be you the prophet says that God will always have a witness in this church God is looking for Witnesses people are acting as if God doesn't as as if God doesn't keep his word that's why sometimes you see people they don't they don't come to church on a Sunday morning because they have other problems to take care of but they forget that God the promise that if you put me first everything else will be given to you but the problem is that we we doubt the word of God and the problem is because we've not had a personal experience with him once you have a personal experience with with God you know that if God did this for me he can do this again David had a personal experience experience he killed the the the the wild animals and when he came in in in front of another another challenge that came in front of him this time it wasn't an animal anymore but it was a a giant a giant that stood in his way but David knew that if God could deliver me from those animals he can deliver me from these giant the prophet says that if you cannot have faith for even a um a a toothache how are you going to have faith for the Rapture so those things are trainings to help us to know that if God can do this for that person he can also do this for and my sermon here is to make to challenge you to God wants to be try God the prophet says God likes to be challenged he likes for you to challenge his word because he wants to make himself known to you and this is a testimony like I said I have a lot of testimonies and um so that was a few years ago in Iowa City it came a time where I also wanted to know if God was real or not I was just going to church just for the sake of going to church I was seeing people getting in the spirit and I started question and I was like what makes me believe that they're not just making it up I was like I'm not them they could just be making this how do I know that this whole message thing I've not been put into like some sort of uh lie maybe because I was just born in it and I just think it's right so that that Friday night I told God that I was like God I want you to make yourself known to me I told God that I've always seen people get in the space but I don't know if it's true or not I told him I wanted to experience that myself remember the Bible says you have not because you ask not so when you you fall short of things don't blame God blame yourself because God because God already made his promise the job is for you to believe you know and then I prayed and and after I prayed we had a service that night and the the minister asked a called for the prayer line and a lot of people were going to the prayer I was playing the keyboard and I was hearing two I was hearing two voice voices in my head one was telling me to go to the prayer line and be pray for and the other one was telling me to just keep playing because if I stop playing then the service is going to be interrupted so this is also to your musicians you have to know what is important playing the instrument is not more important than your own soul the prophet even tells us that even in the church the music is not priority the song service is not a priority it's the word of God that comes first that is just there to set an atmosphere for the word of God so I decided to to hear the voice that told me to go to the prayer line and I was the last one in the prayer line no I was the second to last and everybody was getting prayed for and then he came to my turn and the minister asked me um he asked me what do you want and I told the minister I want the Holy Ghost and the minister was like okay raise your hand and and just start thanking God and tell him how much you love him and that's the key right there because you I started thanking God in advance because the Bible say says that when you ask anything to God you have to believe that you have already received that and then you will see that come to pass so don't twist the the order first you have to believe that it has already happened and and then you'll see that come to pass and by thanking God it create it just automatic automatically creates Faith you that's why the Bible says enter into his gate with Thanksgiving in your heart so I I had my hand my hand raised and I started I started thanking God and telling him how much I love you know so that's that's that's the key for anything you ask God In Prayer just I want to encourage you to already start thanking God for that because the prophet says that when you ask even when you pray for to be saved the prophet say start acting like you are start hanging out with people who are saved and eventually you will be saved so the prophet also used that same key to act in advance because it creates faith in you because the only way you can please God is to Faith even you you you are you are saved by faith you know anything you do with God it takes Faith to unlock the people so while I I was I was thanking God um I felt like I had an experience where I felt like it was it was a that started from here and it started going up and it's like it was a boiling water and by the time it came out of my mouth it was me uh getting in the spirit that was my first time ever getting in the spirit and remember that morning IID asked God that I wanted to know if getting in the spirit is real or not and then after that they went to pray for someone else and then the moment I I I just had a lot of people in my in my heart there's just something the prophet says that when someone is saved the first thing that he thinks about is the Salvation of other people we just saw that with the woman at the well after after she came to the realization that Jesus Christ was the Messiah she she was then concerned about others the prophet says that to know if someone truly has the holy ghost or not he refer the scripture that says that they cry and S for the Abomination so that that's what happened to me that day I started think thinking about my family and I started praying for all of them and I'm just save them too and the whole time I had my hand raised and then I got tired and I I I put my hands down and then I felt the hand of a human of a human he touched my left hand and he started slowly raising my left hand and when I went home I remember I told that to my friends and my brothers but they didn't believe that they just thought I was just making myself you know to have some sort of experience in the church you know they didn't believe that and I told them that okay let's go let's go watch the tape and we went to watch the video and on the so they were saying that there was a sister that was next that that was next to me maybe maybe she bumped into my head and I thought that and I thought all of a sudden it's like God some sort of experience so I told them let's go watch the tape so when we watch the tape we can see that my left hand started slowing and going up without anybody tou and I told people that it was someone who ra my hand I had an experience that day from that day nobody I knew that God was real I knew that God still fills with the Holy Ghost that was the night I received the Holy Ghost it didn't make me a perfect person all of a sudden I still had a lot of shortcomings afterward because the prophet says that that when you receive the Holy Ghost is just the beginning of when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when all the weapons of hell will be charged against but I'm here to tell you that don't be afraid because God says that no weapons form against you shall prosper the enemy May Point his weapons at you but God will be that barrier that protects you against so I had my own experience that God was real and then the prophet also says that to be a witness you can a weakness before the facts happen and the prophet gave the example of Noah he says that Noah before anything happened before there could come any rain Noah was a witness that that God the prophet says that Noah was a witness that there was an intelligence somewhere before the time of Noah the rain never came down but Noah still took God at his word you know he took God at his word and eventually God confirmed his word when you stand for God God is going to confirm his word remember that God does not does God doesn't come to confirm you but he comes to confirm his word because God the prophet says that God is obligated to his own word God is not obligated to you but God is God is a is not a man that he should lie if God makes a promise he has to bring that promise and the prophet says that many times we fall short of the promises of God the prophet says that we leave under our privileges it says that the Bible is full of treasures promises but we are living under those privileges Amen Let me just read this quote real quick all right I I'll go to the blind man who claimed his healing before so so the message is called I perceive that thou are a prophet remember what I mentioned earlier is that before you receive anything from God you have to start testifying that you already received that and I like every time I preach I like to back it up with an example from the prophet to show you that it's not my own words last time I preached on the message the voice of the pillar of Fire we taught that we we understood that the the ministry of Malachi 4 it wasn't a man it was God so whatever he says in the tapes we have to take it as God speaking to so the prophet talks about this uh this blind man and he had gone to the prophets to be to to be to be prayed for so he can see and paragraph 23 his name was John Ryan John Ryan and he says and the prophet told him I see that you are blind and he said yes sir I said the prophet said aren't you aren't you Cath Catholic he said I am and I said do you believe that God will heal you he said yes sir he said I hear some woman over there was screaming and that said let me skip that he says do you believe me to be God's servant the prophet says I have to say that because the angel told me if you get the people to believe you see not to believe me as him but to believe that he sent me to pray for you and the prophet says all right I had a prayer for him and I seen a vision before the old man I said now you have received your sight go and be made whole so when you read when you read the prophet you have to really pay attention to you have to meditate upon what he says pay attention to the order here so he's asking the person do you believe first so you cannot even want uh come to the prayer landine without faith because it's not going to do anything you yourself have to believe first and then he told him that and then the prophet saw a vision and the same Prophet also told us that the word reveal that the word is also an open Vision we also we don't need someone to see a vision in order for us to believe our healing our vision is in the book of Isaiah where he tells us that by his stripes we are already healed that he was bruised for our iniquities so that's your vision so first you believe and then you got to have a vision that tells you that you are healed okay so let's continue reading the story and and then um and I said now you are now you have received your sight go and be made whole remember the prophet says now you have received your but the man still couldn't see so you have to understand that God's language is different than our language that's why God says that his ways are not our way if God says you are healed you don't go by your five senses you go by his [Music] word and it's not just healing anything that you pray about you have to believe that you've already received that and the prophet says he went away in a few minutes here he come back again two men later said preacher you told me I'll receive my sight you told me that I'm Healed you know and the prophet says you are why he said I can't see a thing the prophet says that that don't have nothing to do with your healing you are already healed he said well if I was healed I could see couldn't I Prophet said not right now you might not but God said you was going to see so the prophet took him back to what to the promise of God he told you you you you may not see right now but God said that you are going to see and the prophet says I told you I seen a vision and you're going to receive your sight he said I've seen a vision you going to receive your sight he said he said well looks like if I was healed that I'll be able to see the prophet said not exactly it may not happen now it might happen a week from now a month from now a year from now but it's going to come to pass every promise that God makes in your life may not happen right away not happen tomorrow it may not happen a month from now it may not even happen a year from now brother bam says that we know it's going to happen you are seeking the Holy Ghost it may not happen right it may not happen tomorrow but you have to believe that eventually you will have the Holy Ghost but you got to start acting like you already have the Holy Ghost amen amen there are so many people here seeking the Holy Ghost and I'm here to encourage you to believe God because the prophet says that God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost more than you want to have it in his own time he will make all things beautiful God doesn't go with our timing God has his own time that's why the Bible says that they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength when you ask anything to God you have to have patience that's not in vain that patient is one of the statute amen let's keep reading uh so the prophecy but it's going to come to pass and he said well I don't understand that God doesn't ask you to understand how he's going to make it come to pass God ask you to just believe it you don't need to understand you need to believe him and way he went and then he came back again and he says I can't see yet and I said well I don't have nothing to do with it he he say but you told me I was healed I said sir look you are fixing to lose what you have received the word of God is the same if that man was fixing to to lose what he had received because he started to question the word of God you are also going to lose what you have received the word if you pray for anything and you start wondering God why why is is it not happening and if you start doubting it the prophet says that you are fixing to lose that I don't I don't God doesn't want you to lose what you've been praying for so by that's why by his by his Mercy this morning is reminding you to keep to keep uh to have faith in his word to not look at the circumstance but to look at his promise word because that's why we leave by the Bible says that man shall not leave by bread alone man will leave by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God okay okay and the prophet says we fixing to lose what you received I said you told me that you [Music] believed he said I do he said the the prophet says then what are you questioning me about then if you believe me believe what I've told you uh he says I understand what you mean and the prophet says he just got it and he said what must do preacher said just go home but say praise the Lord and go on apply the same formula this morning whatever you've been praying for just go home and start praising God stop looking at the circumstances stop looking at what your eyes are seeing but go praise God and and I'll I'll continue the story so the prophet even says that the man went to the bar he he went on the street and he was selling newspapers and he was telling everybody that he's already healed to the point that even one person came to him and told him that you are bringing a reproach to the word of God because we can clearly see that you are blind but you are here telling us that you are healed so what he was doing he was applying what the prophet told him to do and he went to the barber at one time and you know he was just screaming extra extra I'm Healed he kept confessing with his mouth that he was healed and eventually one time he the prophet says his eyes open in he started seeing so God kept his word he didn't come the same moment that the prophet prayed for him but eventually God gave him his sight but why did he have to do the prophet says that he he says to in order for him to have a lot of faith the prophet told him to start confessing with his M the Bible tells us that God is a high PR of our confession the Bible says that there is power and death in the tongue so that's why you have to you have to speak things into existence you have to start confessing it with your mouth God doesn't want you to complain all the time he's already given you his word want you to believe it and not just to say that you believe it but you have to act like you believe it how do you act like you believe it you got to come you got to be you got to come with bold boldness and claim your healing claim your inheritance whatever it may be financial problems you know healing spiritual growth you have to start thanking God in advance for it sometimes even before when you when you pray about something we want to see you come to church and say I've got a testimony God did this for me even though you may not see it yet but I want to guarantee you that God will always keep his word you know the problem is you you have to believe the problem is never with the promises of God the problem is that we don't have enough Faith to believe his prom those same promises that God is making in the Bible it's the same promises that William Bram used to do a lot of things and whatever William Brenham did wasn't just for him to do it alone it was a blueprint for the brides to also be able to do those things Prophet says that that voice the voice of God he says that voice is now in the bride he doesn't say the voice will be it says the voice is now in the bride the voice of God that could speak things into existence the voice of God that that could give life to a fish if God could give life to a fish why wouldn't he give life why wouldn't he give life to your loved one is a fish more important to God than your soul the Bible says that your soul is more more than 10,000 world the soul of your family members are more more than the feast the prophet says that God by giving life to the fish he was showing that he also cares about everything he cares about the little things he cares about the big things God just wants you to be happy the prophet says that God wants you to be happy the prophet says God wants you to ask for big things the Bible says in the Book of Malachi God wants you to challenge he says prove me and and you prove me and see if I won't pour out my blessings when God does his part he just wants you to do your part because the prophet says that the Bible says that all things are possible to him that believeth brother says that God did not say all things are possible to God he says that's what man say but all things are possible to you I had that quote somewhere here hopefully I'll find all let me see okay it's in the message the resurrection of Lazarus uh verse 37 the prophet says look deity I'm a part of Charles Bram because I was born from Charlie brandham my daddy I am a part of him I got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small small man like him you know I'm in his nature because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God then the deity dwells in the man Prophet says hallelujah hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing is impossible to God this is why men say nothing is impossible to God but the prophet says but God said nothing is impossible with you if you will believe not with God but you because deity is in a man so this is in your in your control whatever you want is in your control this morning the prophet is taking it off the hands of God and he's put this in your hands and he took that from the from the uh from The Book of Mark chapter 9:23 if we can turn to Mark chapter 9 verse 23 and if you can go to um let's go back a little bit to the verse um the verse chapter 923 okay let's go to verse uh 16 and he asked the scribes what question you with them and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which has a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teth him and he fth and Nash with his teeth and pinth away and I spake to the disciples that they should cast him out and they could not answered him and said oh Faith faithless generation how long should I be with you how long should I suffer you bring him to me so when they when they brought that dumb uh uh the child that that had a dumb Spirit to Jesus and the disciples couldn't cast him out where Jesus put the blame he says faithless generation so the problem was that they didn't have faith and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straight away the spirits tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed for me and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto me and he said of a child so since he was a child he had a demon that that that was uh hurting him you know the prophet says that demons are torment torment torment spirits and this this young man had a dumb Spirit but you may have another Spirit that's been tormenting you for so long the problem is let's use what Jesus says bring him unto me so you need to go to Jesus because he's the solution to your problem and and verse 22 and often times he had cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy [Music] him you see will always try to destroy you the Bible says that he's there to kill steal and destroy anything that Satan brings to your life is to destroy your life to destroy your marriage to destroy your family life that's why you need to have Jesus in the house to kick out that de to cast out that demon because in the in the in the Pro in the message then Jesus came then Jesus came the prophet says that anytime we we we go away from Jesus that's when that's when Trouble Comes so when you have problem in your workplace problem in your house call on Jesus you know bring him to the scene whatsoever problem you have he's going to find a solution and verse 23 Jesus said to him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth you see where the Prophet took it from Jesus didn't say all things are possible to God but Jesus says all things are possible to him that believeth because in you the prophet says that you have even you have the power to even create another world because you have the Creator that lives in the creation but the prophet says that it's it's controlled by the law of Faith amen I I have it somewhere in my notes here but because I'm using my phone to find it it's going to be a little bit difficult it oh okay let's continue I continue so so uh and like I said I'll give I'll be giving a few testimonies because it's not just enough to say that God keeps his word because when a minister preaches something the minister has to leave what he's preaching the prophet says that he never went to to speak on something that he never experience even you cannot go testify of God being real to you if you don't even know if he's real because the prophet says many people call Jesus God by just by sympathizing it's just because your pastor says that just because you heard someone says that but notice when Jesus asked the disciples who do you say that I am Jes Jesus asked who do men say that I am and the disciples started giving all sort of answers but Jesus brought it back to them again by you who do you say that I am because because the power is in you let me read this uh message of the expectation and I'll be wrapping up uh with the testimonies at the end paragraph 61 okay before we read that I found that let's go to uh the everpresent water from the rock paragraph 1 15 so the prophet says if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God will create them a world out out of here and go live in a private life on it the prophet says you have the power in you to do it even if you've got just a shadow of the power of God in you you got the power to do it so if you have the Holy Ghost in you you have the power to go create another world and live so if I if in me I have that power then why should I worry about small things that happen in this world just speak it into existence the prophet says you have the Creator in you because whatever you speak it's not you speaking if you have the Holy Ghost is God speaking through you the prophet says the P the power that in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live in it that's the power that is in the church now it's not in the future it's in this church right now that power every one of us born of the spirit of God can have the power in you to create a world so when I'm reading this quote I don't want you to think about anybody else by yourself because when you don't know your potential that's why the devil just plays with you like he wants to that's why the prophet says that when the bride will know who she truly is then the Rapture will take place you are living under your privileges you have that power in you and you are you are just to say Amen to it and um and the prophec but it is controlled by a law and the law is not keeping a bunch of commandment but it's a law of Faith Jesus says all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours he he did not say some he said whatever God will lead your soul to believe it is not your neighbors but it is yours amen amen every place The Souls of your food can set upon by faith God gives it to you every place your soul even immigration because you know God whatever God does in the natural it's it's also the spiritual the children of Israel even though this also meant the spiritual aspect of it but they still had to go physically uh possess the land do you think that God brought you here in the US just in vain God doesn't do anything by by Hazard God is a perfectionist everything he does there's a purpose to it there are so many millions of people that wants to come to the US but why did God make a way for you why did God bring you here in Iowa I'm here to tell you that God brought you here to be a witness to be a witness of this message to be a witness that God sent a prophet in this last age to be a witness that God rose from the dead God did not just bring here to just be rich or to just to work 9 to 5 or to go to school those are the benefits that comes with you coming to us but that's not the main goal why God brought you here God brought you in this in this city to be a witness and let me continue reading that quote it's yours you possess it and if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean you know if you are a son of God you are or you are a daughter of God that never leaves you that power never leaves you if you are a son of God that that power never leaves you if you are a daughter of God you did not become a daughter of God now you did not become a Son of God just today but you were Sons and Daughters of God before the foundation of the world when you came into this world in you you had that power in so so whatever obst obstacles comes in your way just speak it if you want Health just speak healthy God has already written the check he put He wrote he wrote it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he just gave it to you to apply it the prophet says that God doesn't heal you just today the prophet says that God has already healed you whatsoever you desire God has already given that to you that's why God puts that in your hand he says whatsoever you believe you it will be given to you so it depends on the faith that and if you don't have enough Faith ask God to give you that Faith because the this man says uh Lord I he says um uh I I don't believe by help my unbelief he say he says I believe but help my unbelief that's that's the attitude we need to have when Lord I have faith but if this faith that I have is not enough to get the blessing that that that belongs to me give me more faith because that promise is yours God did not make those promises to Angels God made those promises to you the song says every promise in the book is mine every verse every chapter every long every line belongs to you it's your inheritance Satan has robbed you of your blessings Satan has robbed you of your joy Satan has robbed you of so many things and now it is time for you to claim it back because that doesn't belong to Satan that belongs to you you know the prophet says that when man fell in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam had the title Adam had the power to even name animals to do what to do anything he wanted to the prophet says that Adam was the God of this Earth but when he se he lost that he lost that that that title you know and that that went then Satan took it that's why the Bible says that Satan is the God of this Earth but we see in the Book of Revelation that the lamb was found worthy to take back that possession he wasn't no angels that was the prophet says that Angels were worthy I for that but the problem is that he needed a man to do that the prophet said if you notice the Book of Revelation he never says no he says no man was worthy he didn't say No Angel but because of the law of redemption he needed to be a near Kinsman to redeem that's why God made himself human to be a near Kinsman and he took back that possession that key from the devil he P the price and now he's giving it back to you whatsoever you speak it be given to you now you are Gods on earth now you are the god of your circumstances now now in the future but now this morning you are the god of your circumstances you just need to believe that God keeps his word and then you take it into your your possession and you speak it into existence I'm not keeping track of of the time so I'll just give a testimony real quick I I've given this testimony before I think that was on a Wednesday so for those that never heard it I'll give it again I have like about three that I'll give so um I had an I had an issue with my school before I graduated and the school had a law where the school had a law that if you don't uh submit your assignment on time uh you get dropped from the class and you can only be dropped from the class um two times so the the third the the third time you get Dro from a class you yeah the third time you get dropped from a class you lose access to the school you won't even be able to complete your program anymore so it's just best for you to find another and I had an issue that I struggled with is procrastination always waiting till the last minutes to do things and then I um I missed my first assignment I was Dro I was dropped from the class and then I was like okay I got one more chance I can get back in the class I got back in the class and then I procrastinated again I forgot to submit my assignment and I was dropped from the class and so I couldn't I had to leave the school because I couldn't finish my program anymore and I was so close to the end I felt really bad and I came to church one one night I checked on the system to see if there was actually any possible way for me to register but the class wasn't even in the system anymore so they wouldn't even put the class so that I won't [Music] register so I came to church I I was right here and I started praying and when I was praying um I I heard um it wasn't an audible voice but it's like something spoke to me and something told me why cry speak you know and um I was like well if God tells me to speak it's not up to me to back up that that word it's up to me to be responsible to his own word so I said in the name of Jesus Christ I pray that the class be created in the system and that I can register and that's it I just went back and I contined doing my things and that's one thing about when you ask anything to God you don't have to go back to the same thing all the time you just have to believe it and move on and uh the following day I came back to church again and at night I was like oh I remember I prayed about this issue yesterday let me check if the class is in the system so I checked and then I saw the class and I couldn't believe it I was like like is this real let me see if I can actually you the register maybe the class is there but I cannot register I tried to register and I register I praised God and I came on Wednesday and I gave the testimony CH and when I gave the testimony I went back home Satan challenged me again Satan told me that are you sure that the the policy had stated instead of having two classes maybe you were supposed to fail three times but you thought it was two times and you went in the church and you gave a false test and while those thoughts are going in my head I Reed an email from the school and the school is saying that the school is going to change the policy of the entire school where it's no longer going to be two classes that you fa but it's going to be three classes but it's going to be effective it was going to be effective two months from the email so the time of the email polic stated that it was impossible for me to get back in but God Made A Way and God changed an entire school's policy because of one man's prayer you don't realize the power that's in you God can all even change the laws of this country just because of God changed the laws of the land because of Daniel and if you can do it for Daniel he can do it for you that's why I always tell people like some people when they see what's happening in the political realm they start getting agitated they're like oh Trump is uh going to deport everybody but you forget that you are a son of God the only way that you can be deported from this country is if God allows for you to be deported God didn't just bring you here in vain you can speak things into existence you are the God of this Earth but only if God lives in you the second testimony I have to give and this is while I'm wrapping up um this happened just a few week weeks ago um I don't think I'll mention the name but there was uh there was a a parent in the before that happened I had a dream and in that dream I saw that the son of this one man was in was in some legal trouble something that something that had involved a woman and he was going to go to jail and in the dream I saw that we gathered somewhere and we were about to pray for for the person and I woke up from the dream I remember I went to tell the father of that person and I was like this is a dream that I had so I told him this before even the event have happen and a few a few weeks forward uh I think she gave that the mother gave the prayer request in the church because her son is in legal trouble and after my last sermon that I preached the voice of the pillow of fire she came to see me in the office and she explained the problem and she said she explained exactly what the dream that I had and I told him I told her her that we'll pray about that and God is going to take care of it so we prayed and in the prayer I asked God to drop the charges I asked God to for for that for the that kid not to go to jail anymore and we prayed and we just believed and we moved on and I believe last week or two weeks ago she came with a praise report to say that her son is no longer going to jail that the charges have been dropped this is being a witness that God keeps his word I trusted God I didn't trust myself I trusted God and you also if you trust what whatever God say the same God who could answer my prayer can also answer your prayer and remember the Bible says while Peter yet spoke the Holy Ghost fa so when when Peter spoke the the congregation had faith in what Peter was speaking and they received Their Blessings so even you this morning if you have faith not in my words but in the word of God whatever you desire God is going to give it to you third testimony this happened last Sunday same sermon I preach in Iowa City I I challenged the congregation to to try God to take God at his word for whatever problem they need and I asked them to pray when we when we were praying and um I while I was praying um I I said that whatever you have even financial problem God can give so there was a couple there they needed some money and they called me on Monday to give me the testimony he said while I was praying they were repeating my prayer and especially the part where I mentioned about financial because they needed some money and they said when they walked out of the church not even two minutes after they received a call from somebody who said I just had you in my mind and I thought I'll give you $1,000 why because they took God at his word and I'm telling you that God also wants you to be a witness because God wants you to be a witness that he's faithful to his word you have many question does God keep his word I'm here to tell you that God keeps his word at his word this morning I'm challenging you too Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever whatever problem you have right now you know that the power is in you you know you can stand whatever problem you have right now you are a god of your Sol of your problems you know don't wait on don't wait on God to come do it for you he put this in your hand you know as we sing the song of leave leave it there you know and while we sing whatever problem you have pray to God and God wants you also next Sunday other Sundays whatever problem you pray you going to be witness to that God still keeps his word in this last age you're going to be a witness that this message is the truth amen amen uh franking you lead

just read this quote by the prophet in the message Be Be not Afraid paragraph 200 he says uh that's the way it is today friends this old Bible is just full of treasures all through there why should you be sick or poverty stricken you need money the prophet says why should you be poverty stricken you need healing why should you be sick why should you be cold and in different you want the fire of God to also be in your life the prophet is say why should you be cold or indiff why when the Bible is full of the promises of God don't be afraid it's the Lord Jesus I want to tell you this morning the same Jesus is here if he could do it for others he can do it for you don't be afraid it's the Lord Jesus Christ he wants you to be his witness God has heard your cry God has heard people questioning if God keeps his word or not and God this morning want to show to you that it's not just up to the preacher it's not just for the preacher to pray for you but you have the power in you in the message the testimony of a true witness he says and we realize as Christians that we live so far so far under our privileges we are very very far from our Privileges and he says you do not desire us to be like that tired and weary and run down and weakening always falling down to sin Temptation can get us so easy God doesn't desire you to be like that the prophet says you desire us to be filled with the spirit of God God's desire for this morning is to be filled with his Spirit he says God is true to his promise no matter what he has to do even if he has to bankrupt the heavens before he would let his he'll before he will bankrupt the heavens before he'll let his word go defeated brother B is telling us that God will go bankrupt Heaven before he let his word defeated it he never made a promise that he can't keep brothers and sisters this morning I'm here to repeat the word of the Prophet God does not make a promise that he cannot keep Prophet says I am the Lord that heals of all that diseases if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover if thou can't believe all things are [Music] possible amen do you believe that because God this morning want I I know for sure that in

expectation paragraph 61 in 1961 the prophet said he he separated himself and if you'll notice what he waited for God told him to separate himself from all his Kindred and God never did bless him anymore till he obeyed him fully paragraph 62 and when we get all the little disbelieving Spirits away from us you know if you can project that so paragraph 62 and when we get all the little disbelieving Spirits away from us and just take God at his word and I don't care what so and so said or so and so said God made the promise I stand right here then God will go to answer him but remember he blessed him and he kept him and so forth and fed him and led him from place to place but he never fully blessed him and give him the promise until he completely separated himself from every little thing of the world God has many promises for you but you need to separate yourself from the world in order to see those in your life the prophet says that he let his nephew go on down to Sodom if he wanted to his father died then God told him rise and look through the land I give it all to you God had made a promise to Abraham he gave the entire land to Abraham but he had to separate himself from all unbelief and then and the prophet says L East look north west and south I think that's the way if a church a people ever comes to a place place where they completely separate themselves from the things of the world then you can look through every promise in the Bible all yours you know it's like a a it's like a great big arcade arcade and by one Spirit we are baptized into the arcade some people just come into the arced by the Holy Ghost baptism and say Well thank the Lord I got in thank the Lord I'm here the prophet says that isn't it to me what did God say to Abraham get up and look all through the land it's all It All Belongs to You church this morning this is your land full of promises I encourage you to start looking through all the promises that God made for you don't just limit yourself to One Promise this all belongs to you you know and then he says the prophet says that that's the way that's the way when I come into Christ I wanted to look around not just to know he saved me but what else have I got in there if somebody gives me a big archade I went into it and I like to examine the thing to see what God that's the way with Christians today they fail to examine the promise of God and see that there are to whatsoever [Music] will if something is a little high I'll get me a step ladder and get up to it look on the sh and see what belongs to me you Christians sometimes don't look you don't examine to find out what belongs to you healing is yours salvation is yours Joy is yours peace every promise in the Bible is yours rest is yours he said come unto me you are heavy laden and I will give you rest when a man is filled with the Holy Spirit God gives him a checkbook with a with with Jesus name wrote on the bottom of it just send it in don't be afraid to write it out whatever problem you have Don't Be Afraid even if it's it's too big you know if you believe you can't speak to this mountain and this mountain will be moved and Prophet said and he will send down his Bountiful blessings upon you of what he promised so as as I pray you know just raise your hand and and believe that whatsoever you ask to God he already gave it to you and God is going to prove to you that he's he's faithful to his word Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how good you are Lord God father you give us your word Lord to know father that we can count on your word Jesus the prophet says that in order for you to be God you have to be faithful to your word and Heavenly Father Lord you created us here to Worship You Lord and Heavenly Father Lord you I don't believe in coincidence father you brought this message this morning because you want to you you looking for Witnesses Lord Jesus Lord your word has been put to the test L the word has been put to the test and the question is that does God keeps his word father we are here to say yes you keep your word and we want you father Lord to back up your word Lord Jesus because your Prophet told us father that you are not you are faithful to your word Lord Jesus you gave us so many promises in the in the Bible Lord and we pray that you forgive us for coming for falling short of those promises Lord God and complaining all the time and acting as if we don't have that power in US Lord but you reminded us father that we have the power in us to even create the world into existence Lord your children prayed I don't know what problems they had Lord Jesus I don't know what their needs are Lord but you know their needs Lord Jesus and father you say that you are you will supply to their needs Jesus you you promise that you will supply to our needs Lord Jes and your own word you said that father Heaven and Earth will pass away but your word will never pass away Lord Lord Jesus if there be any unbelieving Spirits here Lord God I pray that you be merciful to that person Lord and that you give him or her faith to believe your word Lord because you don't want us to live under our privileges Lord and father Lord the only way we live under our privileges is when we don't have faith Lord there's so much potential in US Lord God oh I pray that you give Faith to those that don't have faith Lord Jesus rise our faith Lord raise our faith that we may bring your word to uh to to to life Lord Jesus because father your word says that the only way we can please you is by Faith Lord Jesus forgive us of our shortcomings Lord God heal us of our um uh infirmities Lord Jesus and I ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ Lord because you said father that if we shall ask you anything in your name not the name of the father not the name of the son not the name of the Holy Ghost not the name of Allah not the name of Buddha not the name of of this country not the name of trump not the name of the things that we name in this world Lord but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's where our trust is Lord because some put their trust in chariots or hores verse that says but we will remember the name of the Lord for the name of the Lord is our Strong Tower you know you are our strength Lord you know father I pray that you give strength to the weak Lord we may all have different strength spiritually Lord some are weak and some are stronger than others but like M said we not leaving anybody beyond Behind Lord Jesus I pray that you remember the weak one Lord Jesus that you increase their strength Lord God father you said that in your weakness my strength is made perfect Lord Jesus father remember the person who easily Falls to Temptation Lord God father you are concerned about that person too Lord and this morning I pray that your mercy reaches out to him or her Lord I pray that you bless this church financially spiritually with materials Lord God and anything that desire Lord and in advance father we want to thank you already Lord because we believe father that you keep your word Lord Jesus I'm a witness this morning that you keep your word I'm a
