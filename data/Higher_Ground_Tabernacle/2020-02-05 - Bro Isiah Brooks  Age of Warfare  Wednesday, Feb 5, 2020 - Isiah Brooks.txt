there is power in the this power [Music] they respond [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm out of the rhythm god bless you good to be back home as we stand we're gonna get right on into the Word of God we're going to be coming from the scripture according to Isaiah the fortieth chapter I was there 41 and to house there 41 and 2 and then we'll go to 2nd Corinthians 10:3 through 2 through 6 41 and two of Isaiah confidently comfort ye my people says your God speak II comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she have received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins let's go here to second Corinthians the tif chapter everybody love the Lord we're living in the last days and I guess I can't say that enough you should always try to remind yourself that this age that we're living in is the worst of all ages we may have a look at the age of Thyatira where the church was a dominating female we may think that during the time of Smyrna when many were being killed and slaughtered for the name of Jesus it may look like those ages were the worst of all but in reality this is the worst age of all and I think sometimes we forget we sometimes fail to see what we're working with or what is working against us Satan would love to see the Word of God come back void but the reason why it will not and cannot come back void because it is written that the words that proceeds out of the mouth of God cannot come back and shall not come back void it will accomplish its purpose 2nd Corinthians 2 Tim chapter beginning at the third verse but though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness of revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled let us pray Lord we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for this time and opportunity that you have allowed us to come to worship to praise you to thank you for everything that you have done and will do for us Lord we pray tonight that you would have free course give us grace to move completely out of you a way that your will will be done thank you father for being who you are in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen we would like to just say that we are at a time where maybe I'm the one that's insane but I know there's a scripture says make your call and election sure have you ever thought about it that you won't get another chance this is the only chance you're going to get right now the blood of Jesus Christ protects us all that's why you see sinners who can do what they want to do because of the blood of Jesus that blood encompasses the world it protects us from the judgment of God but once a man died and he is found not under the blood his soul takes a journey in that journey is downward up to a place that he'll never get out of there is no judge there to pardon you there is no blood to cleanse you or to sanctify you however tree falls that's how it lay and this is what is always on my mind the very fact that this is it we can't die and then say God forgive me because now this is the time period that God has allotted unto us so that we can have and make provisions for the world to come there is as you have heard me speak before our upper world we call heaven and the underworld we call hell and men are going to those places each and every day while some are going up there are many that are going down and the Bible tells us that even hell has enlarged itself now you think about it hell has not was not prepared for the souls of men it was actually prepared for Satan and his angels but because of sin many have chosen that way over God's Way nobody goes to hell because of their failures because of first of all we're we're born phase and before we ever take a breath of life into this dimension we're already lost we come in here lost but thank God for the grace of God and the opportunity that God has allotted to every man you and I must understand that this is it this is your time and Satan is doing everything he can do to stop you from entering the kingdom of God even when Jesus was here he told us fear not little flock it is the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom but understand since the fall mankind has been in a warfare before Adam and Eve sinned it was a blissful situation a place or time and a error that you and I can't even comprehend because since we've been born into this life we've all faced pain and danger and hurt and disappointments and and all of these things have been caused by the breaking of one word I would entitle this message and they're not going to be long but I like to make you know or reefa millyar eyes you with the fact that we're living in an age of warfare and warfare is when two opponents are two opposite comes together and they fight one comes out as a winner the other one comes out as a loser even when it when Cain and Abel was born you know how it happened you know the story good against evil most of our stories most of our movies most of our lifetime stories that we've ever heard has always been good versus evil now in that amazing because the Atheist says there is no such thing as God but everything we do in this life is a based upon this book if there is no God that would lay down laws that you and I could determine the discern what is good and what is evil if this Bible has no bearing if this Bible is not real and if this Bible is not God then what is good and what is evil because we're living in a time where many are calling right wrong and wrong right and it is only because those who are doing that they have no foundation they are the Liberals they are the ones who are denying the existence of God they're the ones who's trying to kill this but you can't kill the Bible because the Word of God is God and it is the thing that's going to judge every man not me not you but this every soul will be judged by the word we call Jesus Christ now you said what are you saying brother if this is your only chance to make heaven what are you doing about it and when God gave me this thought I was in Florida and I thought about the billions of people that are dying dying but they have morals Absalom may have never lied or never stolen or never killed anyone whatever and maybe they thought that in doing these things it would merit them heaven think about the millions of Christians who found themselves in a place that they could not even imagine they would go but you see what happened was God is faithful God will never lead you the wrong way the Bible even tells us search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life you and I realized that there are those who might will to go to heaven might will to be the righteous but you see this is not a situation that God plans something as he go alone this was predetermined this was thought of before it was ever laid out this is something that God has already of for knew because he's God now God doesn't make us do evil evil is a choice it was a ice Amen that Adam and Eve made they had to decide whether I was spending with the word of stand against it and see that's what makes evil evil is when you stand against God and His Word because his word is right think about the millions generations of people who believed in Buddha Islam Allah forever I know this sounds strange but I want you to realize that there are billions of people who are lost because they never came to know Jesus Christ did you hear what I said I said they never came to know Jesus Christ see to even confess I am a Christian won't get you heaven hello whether you want to branch it or not to say all praise God I believe the message I believe God sent a prophet you see but that doesn't secure you the thing that secure you is that the fact whether or not you know him or not is that right because according to the scriptures even in the Christendom many will come in that day and said Lord have not we done mighty works in your name and he will say unto them depart from me you workers of iniquity I don't even know you many who may have gifts of healing gifts of prophecy gifts of all sorts of things have seen miracles at the miracle at the miracle but they fail to know him him who Jesus Christ see he's not a religion he's not the figment of somebody's imagination it is a reality it is a place that you and I have been called to and that is a glorious place and you know how to be so happy that God has called us out of the millions of people in the world because so many people have clothed themselves and religion and religion won't get you nowhere close to heaven in so much that Jesus said that the righteousness of this generation must supersede the righteousness of the Pharisees and if any of you are familiar with the Pharisees the Pharisees was a very astute group of people learn educated smart that could tell you amen put their fingers on a scroll with blindfolded and tell you exactly where the scripture was and what it was they knew it backwards and forwards oh when it came to to perfection they had the outward appearance looking just so perfect and even John the Baptist came along and says but I see you John the Baptist understood that there was not nothing righteous and holy about these people all we were but then they were hypocrites snakes he said you generation of vipers here when I'm saying tonight because you and I must realize it's you in God not me and you and God is you and God you must come to know Jesus Christ for yourself hello is a one-on-one situation we come together we come together as Christians because we have a common goal we have a common entity here we all believe that Jesus Christ is Lord but until that Jesus come into your heart you you don't know him a condo minded man the Bible said cannot even perceive those things that are spiritual that's why people get so thrown off they get thrown off but people call themselves Christians because they see them swearing and cursing and drinking and smoking in all of these things doing all these things one of the worst things you could have a person say to you well if that is being a Christian I don't have nothing to do with it what a testimony this is the age of warfare did you not know that even a baby fights to come into this world there's a battle going on in that womb that she or he must press through the veil a thing that's keeping it from the world to come a lot of pressure I don't know about the pain but I know one thing for certain when the baby comes out nowadays they don't wait for spanking they already screaming in Holland it is a it is a it is a a rough situation is horrible why is just such a little thing like that well I shouldn't have to come through such a horrible way in order to be born into this world all of that is because of sin you know but even so that baby has to fight that that gets here to remain alive what we don't see is all of the germs and all of the bacterias and all of the demonic forces that comes against a child if it wasn't for the immune system that God has set up the child would never make it you understand me what are you saying brother I'm saying even as a newborn babe in Christ if it wasn't for the immune system of the Holy Ghost we wouldn't make it you can't make it without the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost it's not a jump in a shout or speaking in the tongues and running up and down the house all of that is good I love it all but at the end of the day is Christ living in you what is your ambition what is you what what is what are your thoughts during the day ah is it on God or or is it on the world or the things of the world because the Bible says if you love the things of the world the love of God is not even in you then the Bible can't lie and what is it if there is a love for the world we need to examine ourselves it is a battle people you just don't become a Christian overnight you may be able to profess it but when you become a Christian you're now in the battle field now you're no good for evil you've got to resist evil and clean to the good part there is no way you can do it without the help of the Lord none of us can defeat Satan of ourselves it takes God Himself hallelujah this is your only time you're not to get another chance and none of us know where death is you can't say well when I get older I'm going to serve the Lord today is the day of your salvation is this okay but we understand that there has been a battle thought and there has been a victory won and this was what Isaiah was saying to the children of Israel God has come to comfort you your warfare is over in other words I have seen all of your wickedness I've seen all of your evil deeds but I have comfort to you have come to comfort you and I'm gonna give you a double portion of goodness you see when Jesus Christ came he was our only way out of this horrible place you know every time I read the scripture and David says Lord you delivered me from a horrible pit I think about this place this place is a pit is a hole in the ground hallelujah no good thing it's in this place come on y'all y'all know I'm telling the truth now I'm gonna go ahead and hurry up because I want you to know that we're living in a time where everything is at war not just you nations against nations families against families friends against friends y'all understand me everybody's fighting everywhere nobody's exempt now we're living in a time whether the battles are so intense that if you didn't have this you would lose your mind literally if you didn't have something that you can go back to that could college you in a time that that's most needed you see cuz sometimes people fail you they can't be there when you need them to be there but God can God will never fail you he will always be there you see I look at this thing I said oh my god how many people even in this message resting on religion resting on the fact that they have eyes to see that God sent a prophet they believe it eyes and to see and to hear and deserve that God was in William Branham that don't mean nothing until you get the God that was in William Branham in you it profits you nothing is that right he said what do you what do you what are you saying listen the god that was in loza's was also in joshua that's why they had a new spirit that's why they had a different spirit because the same God that was in lawes's was in Joshua and Caleb and it played his way out when when when Moses went off the scene same God and we're making sense I'm putting putting you on the nervous place I want to put you in a nervous place sheep get nervous when the wolf is around but they have no defense outside of the Shepherd and we need the shepherd we need him in our defense we need him as for the one amen they will look over us and kill the enemy because we have no defense system outside of the blood of Jesus Christ what are we going to do y'all you think about the world is falling apart look at what's happening there in China do you really think that somehow this germ came from nowhere our prophet called it germ warfare and he said every body that do not have the Holy Ghost will be smitten by this germ warfare look how it's spreading you know people open your eyes China was just at war with itself revolution Amen people rising up against the government the government said we'll fix you y'all might think I'm crazy but this is the way I see it so they unleashed this virus he watched the politicians won't get sick those who are ruling the country they're not gonna get sick you're not gonna hear them dying and here America says oh let me find a vaccine they already got it but they make the people believe that they don't have it because you know what they're doing they're downsizing everybody is downsizing too many go read somewhere that's what's happening they downsizing do you think it's gonna spread here it's already here what America gonna do they're gonna downsize huh look at it something's happening the ocean is downsizing tons of whales tons of of seals and purposes all official dying what's going on this is the end time this is what's supposed to happen today is supposed to not only strike the land but also the sea and most of these things are being caused by who man we are the ones that's causing it and then they talk about that that the polar caps is melting why all of the pollution that's in the air it is a law of nature to clean it up we are causing these things look at us folks these are all Brotherhood's what are you saying look at us we we even in our country supposed to be that shouldn't be the most healthiest people in the world but we'll never be the healthiest because most of our food is hybrid when hybrid food is death ain't no life in it apples look like an apple but they're not tastes like an apple but it's not as long as it's hybrid there's no life in it it's not giving you anything but pulp bulk however you want to say it that's the reason why we have to take vitamins cuz what we need is not in the fruit it's not in the vegetables is in these capsules and then a lot of that died out before it gets to you now I'm trying to speak truth tonight you go fight for what you want are you gonna die in the battle you won't heaven you gotta fight forward you ain't gonna just be be given to you on a horse are batteries no you gotta fight for it you got to be determined you know how you fight you fight by yielding to the word you fight by surrendering to the word is that right what people don't understand amen Hitler conquered Germany before he conquered any other place and before God can conquer in your life he must conquer you first are you willing to fight only if he can't good until he conquers you huh you saw what do you mean look how great Samson was he gave God all of his gifts he was able to fight the Philistines and kill with a jawbone and pull up gates of Gaza and all kinds of great things but since then gave God his strength and that's what the church is given God strength God don't want your strength God wants your heart and the very day that Samson finally surrendered to God and gave God his heart that's when he became more than a conqueror and when you give God your heart I mean all Lord I give you a portion of a heart you won't go nowhere with that you got to give God your all and it's a fight guess what nothing no one wants to die a cat a dog a horse when death strikes they fight to live is that right and that's what we're doing with the Lord I want to die and shoes God come to kill you you fight him you fight to live this life why because we are afraid we are afraid of the unknown but that's what God wants you to do Cass I see the pub's have perfect love casts out fear you've got to surrender to God or you won't go there you understand me everybody's suffering now in one way or another family members children's mama daddy that that's the Bible you know the route said in the last days husband will be guests against wives children against their parents it's happening you're in the mix and it doesn't mean oh I'm in the message that gonna make a difference no those spirits are here and they're coming to knock on your door right but we must understand there is a world of defense no evil shall come not my dwelling place but if we feel that Scripture what do you mean fear it if we fear that we speak it is not going to come to pass it will not come to pass you've got to have faith in that scripture in order for it to work you love the Lord we don't watch the wrestle against flesh and blood and so when Jesus Christ conquered death hell and the grave she see God is a just God he's a merciful God garden is the throw us into this dimension and said just just just just que sera sera whatever will be will be no sod he had a plan I like the way Einstein say this he said that time is a space or that God gave us he didn't say God but that is given to us so that everything won't happen at the same time see without time time make things happen in intervals and pieces but eternity we don't know what's there God sees everything nothing really evolves with God it's only in time everything evolves but you see with God everything is that's why he says I am I am right and that's why he used the scripture Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and equate that and it comes back to I am so because there is no time where he is time is is what he allowed to be placed in this dimension so that we can learn of him hallelujah but think about it when we get on the other side we won't have to learn there be no colleges there not being a degrees there are any scarless Scholastic chap scholarships we will know all and we will be known even as we are known will be in what we call a word body which is that body that God gave us before we came here right we have a body Paul says we do Paul sent him this earthly tabernacle be dissolved I have a building which he was working with a body there is a body that when we leave this body we go into that body which is called a word body which God has made eternal everlasting however you want to put it but in this in this dimension let me make it simple it ain't deep anyway but you and I in the mind of God has already gone through this battle but what you mean brother rules because before the twenty-four elders you had 12 that I already had past you had 12 and some of them were still living when John wrote the book on the Isle of Patmos and John saw the 24 elders sitting on twenty-four Thrones and John saw what Ezekiel saw he saw the twelve tribes of Israel the elders of that tribe setting on 12 Thrones so God had already full ran because he's not subject to time but he takes that in that's why he says I'm the Alpha and the Omega he takes the end and puts it in time so that we could read it and believe it and have faith that he that begun the good work in us its faithful to complete it you see John said I saw a number that no man can number now if God wanted to give every name he could have done it but there were never been books that would have been able to contain all of those names but he knew that once that word would go out that there would be somebody who would say I know that one of those in that number is me those who overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony you got to understand this is a battle and you and I we fought with him Micah even in the beginning when Lucifer was cast out we stood with Christ you don't remember it but God brought a book of remembrance and he knew that if I could get my seed those who who fought with me in the beginning they would be able to read this book and somehow everything would become familiar they would know that this is where I belong I don't know about everybody else but I know that I feel more at home being a Christian in a sinner something about this book it encouraged me it gives me strength see it somehow it makes a connection with the entire eternal God think about it what was it God knew that in the beginning when he first called Abraham he knew the mountain that he was gonna take Abraham - he knew the sacrifice he was gonna call Abraham the hare because in his mind his son would be sacrificed right and you said what do you mean what do you mean you see see God he he does things he said all of the scripture the Old Testament was given to us for what ammonition huh - a mana sure to correct us and and to keep us in line God didn't have to do that what makes it so that you like this word or love this word when others hate it explain that to me even though you cannot live it you still love it why this is a warfare and what I'm working with tonight is what your mind I'm working with your mind tonight because I want you to consider it meant what we've been doing for the last 24 hours or the last week or last month or the last year have we been preparing and have we set our goals and we see have we have we kept our eyes on Jesus what are we doing what are we doing understand you won't get a second chance this is not how could I say like this if there is a second chance this is it at the bit this is that right that's what Hebrews says Hebrew says oh if you come into the knowledge of the truth and you turn from it there remains no more sacrifice for sin for you it doesn't mean you became a real believer that's not even what they say it's saying that even if you came up to the borderline you saw God moved and you knew that was God moving and you turned around says I'm not I don't want that willfully walking away from it there's no coming back see that's Hebrew six but the greatest thing that is a curse to us we fear fear and fear is the opposite of faith like faith can move mountains faith and fear can put you at all oh-hoh it's just the opposite fear takes you to hell faith can take you to heaven hallelujah perilous times shall come means to be lovers of their own selves and covetous and boast and proud and blasphemous now let me tell you this Paul was not writing this to the world Paul wrote this to the church God brothers I've heard that before but let me ask you something lovers of themselves we all find ourselves sometime guilty we love ourselves more than we love God how do you know that because we do our will instead of his will hmm covetous Oh and and surely we none of us have that problem with boasting sometime do we do it priority for hallelujah disobedient to parents unthankful and y'all know that this is the right age you can't even get children to listen to their parents children rule their parents in the grocery store in the Bay on the street in the restaurants back in my day we brought the ruler so they would know who the ruler world and now they call that they call that that were they call that now where they abuse child abuse now what we going to do about a parent abuse because they abuses us oh it's the truth see in my day you can't say this now but my mom would say I brought you in and I'll definitely take you out and they meant it Hey no child would ever get up in a parent face yeah yeah not even a word back and my mother was a true Christian but she had a aim that wouldn't miss and if she couldn't reach you like this whatever she had next tour she now y'all call that abuse now but I tell you what it kept us out of jail huh it kept us out of jail it learned it made us know how to respect our elders somebody help me is the truth we have watered it down why because we allowed liberals we allowed people that that just don't believe the Bible at all to be in our politics and they changed our world come on summarize the truth but it had to happen this is the darkest of all age why am I talking like this because a many of us are being influenced by the darkness and don't even realize it the Bible said that God would have us hot or cold I mean if us is hot in here tonight huh he said lukewarm us feel you but we're not afraid to be spewed what is it what is it that we're not afraid to be spewed something wrong with the picture we are warfare in the same time Satan is cooling us little by little he's a he's a creeper he's a slithery he slowly moves by the time he wraps you around you don't even know your rap till you feel the squeeze and you feel the squeeze is too late to get free may God help us why are you preaching like this because I have a desire ain't meant to see perfection that doesn't mean but in everybody that say they believe this message because this message is the only word that can take you there it is the only entrance but if we neglect to walk in it Christians don't know they gotta have patience and faith and godliness and temperance a lot of them don't know that they say well you know I'm saved by grace you are but grace takes you up Jacob's Ladder you've got to climb it whether you like it or not if you're gonna make heaven you got to climb Jacob's Ladder if I could say it like that you got to go higher that's why Paul said leaving the principles of God the doctrine who I know I'm saying cuz I've been baptized many people who've been baptized aren't saved didn't make it to heaven all the praise God I shouted I danced I spoke in tongues Paul said that's nonsense you know better now you understand the election you understand the call hallelujah Devils can do all of that but I've called you to a higher calling you got to live like Christ walk like Christ talk like Christ everything must be him you must become like Paul said I don't only live but it's Christ in us and it is a journey it doesn't happen overnight a child doesn't grow from a baby to a grown up in one day it's a process a lot of Falls a lot of getting up hallelujah scraping the knees scraping the elbow however you want to look at it but that's the way it is you see what brother Brooks what are you saying I'm saying we see the time let's go say we not we don't have to tell you of the times this time won't take you this time and season won't take you like a thief in the night you can see it the word has been brought to you it's been brought to us think about it I can't stand the fact that there's so many people even among ourselves we're jumping with shouting we can quote the problem we can quote the word we can quote this that in the other we can tell you about whatever happen on sunset mountain it leaves nothing except Christ being you yeah Jesus got to live there you are the temple of God and if God in the temple who's in there somebody somebody's in the temple but this temple this body was made for God not for subscribe demons look what he says if the message the way to have fellowship the perfect God says that's the trouble with man tonight that's what the trouble with people tonight you're scared that's the biggest curse there is on the Full Gospel people or any other people it's because they are afraid God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight why you wouldn't you would take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the things would just go plum away from you afraid scared I've noticed it and that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen I talked with sister Karen who had a bad operation well the operation anyway had left her afflicted and in one of her hands she she can't even operate as of yet and she had to learn how to walk all over again and everything it took everybody by surprise but I talked with her today she called me to get sisters Angie's number and I just started talking to her and she said brother Brooks she said I know the way I look bothers some people she said but it doesn't bother me she says cuz I glorify God every every day all the day whenever I glory I praise God she said because I realized that this was given to me by God to perfect me how many people look at it like that we'll look I saw Lois me Paulsen Desert thorn in my flesh I sought the Lord thrice three times and the only answer I could get from God was my grace is sufficient he kept all from being puffed up because God hates pride about said pride comes before a fall that's how come Lucifer fell he was flawed pride you understand me I know that if you can get away from scared and get love in this place it's the truth don't you know you can conquer almost I mean let's put this way if you're not afraid of a sickness you can conquer it because Satan used fear and fear is torment and fear is a lack of faith and if he can get you to fear he's already conquered you period I walked the waters on faith the moment he feared he's saying see if fear that conquers you what are you afraid if you're truly a Christian you should never be afraid to die but Satan said if you don't get this done you gonna die and if you don't have this operation you're gonna die hello I'm gonna die after the operation - you're gonna die so what difference does it make whether I die before I after am I making sense Weehoo time but people say well I just don't want to die right now that's because you don't have a revelation of heaven you don't have a revelation of the other the world a calm hallelujah somehow Paul revelation was different from there Paul said I desire to go I want to go but he won't let me go because I still got work I must do for y'all so I might as well work propulse it I want to leave here but you talking about ooh mercy Lord see we get it all mixed up like like you heard the people say well you know you know everybody want to go to heaven but they don't want to die to get there hey but it's true is that right the only itay the truth you you know you see these people can't Holly make it and want to hold on no if real Christians no no no no Lord win-win here how long Lord this is y'all think you're gonna wake up in the morning with the old Lord sweeping through the city it's gonna be so peaceful today the birds are singing Hallelujah huh and you gotta understand to think about it I've been looking at those creatures on YouTube you know animals you know so far reason you know how they haven't where we're hunting animals hunting each other whoo I'm so glad I'm a human being how many how many how many deer you know died from natural causes Oh age everybody in the jungle get eaten you get you all run you you got your dozen that's a horrible death you can't even go drink water you go drink water and the alligator get you yeah you you we don't know how good we got it yeah oh look I say Oh Lord I said I'm so thankful can you imagine being eaten alive yes and you know what the bad thing about it you hardly ever get any help the other animals look at you like you know all of them they know they can whip that lion but they just go but my party is that's a horrible way to die but all of that was caused because of all that right fear you see those those animals fighting for their lives there's only two dissing but at some point in time they know that that's that's the last day you know there's only two falco T's that governs a human and one of them is faith which brings result in the other one is fear which has no value in it all faith is of God faith is fear is of the devil fear makes you weary anybody weary you know used to worry and what you worried about that's not of God it's not of God even in the Bobbsey we don't understand about they don't even take no thought for tomorrow we just don't take a thought for tomorrow we go months ahead of us right don't even take no thought and we don't even think about we are weary and we're breaking the promises of God and faith is the only thing that's gonna move your situation and the devil got you worried and the sad thing about it is there are times you're worrying and you don't even know it why because somewhere your prayer life has been broken you stay in prayer consecrated to god you'll never worry let me move on you saw all brothers who say let me tell you even some of the greatest men of God has been placed in a place where they didn't know what to do worried when God has done so many great things is that right look at Moses a prophet of God he's crying out to the Lord Lord that mercy and God said why are you crying to me and often time that's what God is thinking why are you crying unto me speak it go forward believe that I'm with you I've given you the authority you say you got the Holy Ghost you say God is in you make your mountains move hey my wife and I've been praying about a situation I'm not ready to see any what it is yet but today I got a letter my wife was screaming I'm like Oh what hurts my ear she got a pitch she was so happy she probably my husband is estranged me cuz why she's getting happy I'm like I was in pain but nevertheless I felt what she was feeling but I had my Julie early but you know it was a thing that looked impossible it looked like it was going to be impossible and out of nowhere god fixed it so don't you ever think that the devil got you in a place where you can't get out the Bible says that the Lord will always make a way of escape that's what I used to cry our God there's gotta be a way there must be a way and I didn't have to do nothing God fixed it hallelujah my faith is of God fears of the devil fear makes you weary fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the more what good would it do me to get all stood up about it well if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would that do for me to worry about it worried what good will it do you to worry now what were we gonna do for you when you're dying now if you save and you're Christian there's no place to worry hmm how many y'all believe that so what we gonna get that I'm finna close here now because there's a place of hiding there's no hiding in this place there's no continuing City everything moves everything changes even since I've been in in Ankeny my wife and I have seen major changing I just learned they're building another elementary school up there and it's just growing and growing nothing stays the same I was telling my wife tower somebody the other day after Bob my little place would be looked at looked upon there's two ghetto cuz everybody else was getting so big and fancy that's the truth but there's a time when we we had a little something-something but now everything is changing that's the way it works nothing stays the same here hallelujah places where I used to live in South Carolina are no longer there from my childhood everything's gone all the way up to about duck even places where we used to live they're no longer there been bulldoze with over ten other projects as something else has been built upon you're not gonna stay the same and I'm gonna tell you how y'all looking at me I am old to some of y'all but give God give give time a chance you're coming you better enjoy youth like take photo Timothy don't let nobody despise you you see Paul knew what he was talking about age comes and pain come with age oh it's the truth and it's all because this is a place of death nothing about this place is life everything is death everything's died whatever lives die but there is a place where no place there's a place where you never die see there's always a positive and a negative hallelujah you know even the highest I knew about relativity I love that that you can be in two places at one time heaven and earth at the same time the Bible says it we're now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now yet was sitting in this place we have representation hallelujah what do you mean just like that body was falling for you in the natural and all of a sudden the spirit came into it is that no I didn't yes it did because when your heart was beating it was because of the life that was in your mama hey she was the one that was supplying you with oxygen hmm but when that neighbor cord is cut you own your own that's why some babies just die some live but what we gonna do you got a fight you got a fight you got a fight you got a fight to come into this world and you got a fight to go out right Ostra truth there said even a little chicken got a fight to get out of the shell you can't even help it while this fighting is building his lungs and everything else up the heart is getting stronger so if you if used to break that shelf for that little chickadee it will die because it wouldn't have the strength to breathe God can't help you no more than he's already helped you but you gotta fight to live and you gotta live to die you understand what I'm saying amen because there is a place we call it the Holies of Holies we call it the Holies of Holies represents Christ the Bible said that city won't need a light because the lamb is the light the lamb is the temple hallelujah in order for you to get into that temple in all of you to get into that Christ in order to get into that party you must be born again by one spirit and I tell you the truth what gets me is because so many of us think we got it but what is your life display that Beethoven is in the inside of you it's going to play it will compose everything about you will become Beethoven and if Jesus Christ is on the inside everything about you will become Jesus Christ there is no way that you can stay and says well oh wait you I've been this way for five years you better find out why you don't wait for five years have you really had a true birth house have you got a real birth what's in you will manifest itself as it grows but if there's no real birth you're just imitating Christianity manufacturing it it's got to be a life in you to change you because you can't change yourself it's Christ being formed in you that makes the difference that's what brings you to heaven Christ must be in you to get there let me hurry up I'm almost done so we can say that this is holy and that is holy there's only one thing holy and that's Jesus Christ the son of the Living God who has been laid perfect and our requirement is to be perfect now how we're going to be the viet try it yourself I'd hate to try to get to heaven on the merits on the mayors of I was born five minutes ago and I'm going out of the world right now I'd be lost if I never had even thought in my life if I never spoke a bad word in my life if I never looked at anything evil ever thought anything evil or nothing how just as just as ranked and it's black as its money walls of Hell I'm a sinner I could come through life and stay locked up in a room like some of the Carmelites sisters or something and never see the world stay in there and pray all my life do good born a multi-millionaire and give to the poor everything I got and I'm still a sinner and we'll go to hell I might join the Lutheran Church Baptist Presbyterian you know when I'm old the cradle roll and live faithful to that church until a hundred years in my life it took and no man could point their finger at me and say he ever even had a as much as a bad thought I go to hell just as sure as I'm standing I'm a sinner that's correct I have nothing there's no way at all I could find any price to be paid God required death and I give my long life if I give my life then now can I repent because you see the dead has to has got to be paid first God was the only one who could lay his life down and take it up again so he could become sin and lay his life upon a life down and pick it up and call it justice and the debt is paid there you are you see you and I must understand and let me say like this that's why Christ is so important that's why Jesus Christ is are so important that's why having the Holy Ghost is so important now you've got to see changes in you not your own that's what Paul says it ain't about handle not taste not touch not that ain't here you got so many people who could practice being moral and practicing is not it there's got to be something that makes you hate doing evil coming from the inside out right it ain't you is him in you living through you step by step right taking you through this journey and as you walk this journey you're getting more mature things that once amuse you no longer amuse you things that once attracted you you know pretty women are handsome men look like junk to you now because of who they are versus who you are you understand me it's something that changes you you don't change it it changes you that's how you know you got something like that person that those Saint says yeah I'm not what I used to be it not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I ought to be y'all know I go I always mess it up but anyhow I'm not the same person I used to be and I can see the changes I love the changes and as far as i concerned I'm concerned if they don't come quick enough but I thank God for what he's given me but God who is rich in mercy I'm closing with this for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sin have quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved that's what you must know it is grace it you can't do it but he's the one that can and you have to say Lord I can't do it but I need you to do it for me that's when God makes the changes inside you understand me when you say Lord I can't do it but I want to do right that's how God has brought me a mighty long way you know how because I never like to win you know if I liked a certain sin I would tell it I like it that's why I keep doing it I hate it I hate it for the fact that that that that that you hate it I know it's wrong but I need to be delivered from it in order to please you lord help me deliver me from this that's how I've gotten my deliverance your hi don't go before God you know I just hate it Lord and you and then you say well if you hate it while you keep doing it ain't nobody gonna keep smashing my finger huh let me hear him put time with the hammer I guarantee you ain't gonna put it down there second time ah because of the pain you hate it now something wrong with you if you got a hammer and you cause me in that thing it makes no sense right so when there's something in your life whether it's temper lost and that that has so many layers to it uh no matter what it is you know what I've been struggling in and I say struggling I've been asking God to kill my will because I found out that that little will of mine creeps in and in it's so subtle I don't even know it's my will until it takes his position then I realize I've done something or said something that wasn't appropriate for Christians to say or do you understand me so your will can get in your way you say what do you mean somebody says hey bring me a cup of water are you thinking you know he ain't gonna hurt you to get a cup of water I think Mountain um one thing about my wife my wife is good but if I ask him for something she gonna do it yeah that's one thing for sure now I don't know what goes on in our head but you normally should get the victory she's never telling she never told me to get your old water in four to two years never she's never told me go fix your own food never know but but to say all of these things you know you think about all of the sacrifices and if we could just surrender you know the truth of the matter is when somebody asked you to do something you don't always have to feel like doing it at the moment but think about it and repair right because that's the scripture remember when the when the father said son go do this do this soldier do this he said oh I'll do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it and he never went but the other one said services I'm not going to do it and then he repented and he went and did it and Jesus said which one of these did the will of the father the one who repented see so sometimes you got to push that man out of the way I said I'm gonna do it if you don't like it I'm gonna do it anyway to the glory of God right that's like the Nakhla in portunity I'm already Ameritrade close your friend knocking on your door at night and you he knows he can only he's the only one they go knock on your door at night and get an answer it's the truth especially when I was in the world a friend could come by two o'clock three o'clock in the morning and you'll get up and you get up all fresh like what you own anyway when it comes to the grace of God you and I must understand in order to set in heavenly places you can't be in hell you got to be in heaven you understand I'm closing on this because I won't you understand don't you everything don't you relax this is not the time to relax this is not the time there's a oh well case or without God is if he's gonna do it he's gonna do it well if it's election he'll do it if it if I'm justified he'll do it you understand me if it's election yeah I get there that's the wrong attitude you'll never get anywhere like that yes I'm elected and I want to see what the election is doing in this season and whatever they doing that's what I want to do give me the grace a nod meaning to be what you're doing in this day cuz the move is on the bride she's not dead whether we believe it or not they're miracles and things that are happening now but what's happening most of all is that God is shaping you up for a greater battle halle-loo that's why everything is topsy-turvy that's why things are knocking and knocking you and hitting you all kinds of places and everywhere because God is training you for the coming storm if you can't take it now what you going to take what you're going to do when they start boycotting and shutting the doors and you can't come to this place or somewhere else and you got to take the mark and you got to do this and you got to do it what you gonna do what you gonna do when when you're separated from your friend and you find out your friends are gonna betray you anyway what you gonna do it's happening on a low scale now what's going to happen when the real pressure come see i'ma tell you one thing the devil Emma clothes they're one thing the devil said to turn to God say you know I can tell you whether job is really a believer or not so you don't brag on him and you don't put a hedge around him you protect the job you gave him millions you gave him flocks and cattle and children and everything everything Joe asked for you gave him I'll tell you what I don't know how to get him I can get him just like I get every man let me touch his flesh and that devil just didn't touch how many all we ever had a boil you know what a boil who you don't ever want to know one you might don't you go look it up it's alright to see it from that angle but when you got a boil it's an infection that comes and it gets like a knot and it grows and as it grows the pain grows right a lot of times they have to surgically open it up and move it my wife will tell you I had three of them one time don't even know where it came from had one under my arm one on my side I forgot where the other one work went all the way out to UM Arizona looking for some herbs to kill it and this lady gave me some mud I put that mud on there I thought I was doing it was actually healing it but it was drawing it you know slowly anyway I took the mud off I couldn't take the pain and I was down there in in in in South Carolina preaching at brother Simmons and I'm in pain in his left side and while I was preaching haha Holy Ghost came and I'm telling you the Holy Ghost broke that thing Wow just messed my shirt up but that was the best feeling I ever had in my y'all yeah it was demons it was demon power you show what you taught my brother God is my witness I was in so much pain I would take a razor blade and slice it and by the time I finish slicing it that thing closed back up and nothing would come out Devils and the Bible said joke had boils from the top of his head you talking about pain you're talking about miserable and he never cursed God what we get an accident have little problems at all over health and we say why me Lord that's my brother let me say God sometimes feel like kicking us around I know it why not we spoiled we got it too good and then the least no trial come we almost feel like God has rejected us y'all love the Lord you gonna find that's what Paul said be a good soldier fight like a good soldier don't let your joy window keep your joy because that's where your strength is you took my old brother lose it you want to grow you want to grow don't you understand you ever heard of growing pain I'm trying to quit I'm talking to somebody because you gotta realize you're gonna suffer if I said if you suffer with me your rain just don't let your suffering be because I'm evil doing but when you suffer for the name of Jesus Christ God has a great reward with for you this is the age of warfare I know it's right the thought God gave me I know it's right the pleading that God has put in my spirit toward the Christians and myself is right you only get one chance you die without the blood of Jesus Christ there's no time no no but to rewind and Lord let me come again in some kind of you know reincarnation though ain't nothing like that this is it and I think we've taken things too lightly you know Harley praying Holly reading the studying you know those kind of things it's just foolishness when you know that that you're not getting a second chance it's like you know we you know coming to the end of the year you know and you doesn't been slothful throughout the year and you're in your high school and you know it's all of a sudden you you feel like you may want to make a eighty ego get no egg not have you been making C's and DS barely making it even if you made an a on the final exam when they ever get out hey you're not gonna get no egg you get an A if you maintain an a right let's not come down to the end of the road and you said what brother Brooks our God God help me I want to hear you say well done we're done about what brother Bose what what did you do well done about what what did you do to say we're children you know what I'm saying it's simple but it's true how can you want God to say well done when you ain't you didn't do nothing huh think about it what I'm trying to say to you tonight this little church we don't have many but if we could all individually get in our hearts and our mind that we're gonna please God and make him happy with us let God be number one and we could get that in our hearts and our mind we could we could tear the city apart because they'll see Jesus Christ real they're seeing through your lives they'll see a people committed you know and and I only used sister Karen because you know what she amazes me she go to the hospital they know God by the time she finished her doctors everybody knows Jesus they think she's crazy just the other day she was having problems in her house and the Lord told him prayer says you got moan told exactly where the mold was in her house they had this man come out he did all kinds of tests couldn't find nothing she said but Sir the place that God told me the mold was it's right over there he went over there and his machine went haywire right see that's how real God is is that right you think about who's out talking to somebody today I said think about this lady this this Aunt Jemima down there it was a Mississippi whoever but here she was praying I was talking to somebody that's it that's right her connection a Pentecostal woman was so connected with God she says Lord where's thy Elijah praying for her six thunders dying and God answered her prayer and sent Elijah that that's the kind of connections if it was then it could be now that's why I can't settle for religion religion drives me I can't do it I got to see the saying my mom was just a Pentecostal lady I'm closing I'm trying to anyway my momma couldn't read all right but when she said jr. the Lord said it happened just like that everything she ever told me has come to pass there was a time I didn't even know how she knew because back in the day I used to like to eat and my dad left us and left my mom with all those kids and all that and one day she must have saw it either my bed was making noise or my lips with white I don't know which it was but she said junior don't worry God is gonna send us food now this is you meet some of y'all may not understand this and never but I'm gonna tell you something just as sure as my mom said dad I opened up that back door getting ready to go out to play and there was several bags of food on the back porch and to this day we don't know who put it there but the Lord see those are the kind of things you say why God allowed that to happen just like he did with Elijah he allowed a raven to feed Elijah how many y'all would have been eat the hind a blackbird huh oh hey we all know what a race do you know what a raven is a raven II dad stop and cut use the words for her to bring your lunch tamo humility keeping a man humble and then on top of that God takes an old widow woman that's about ready to die perhaps more than likely skin and bone and tell Elijah you tell her fix mine first see some of us was we we say that that's not logical ain't nothin logical with God God don't use logic and as long as you use logic and processes in this world by logic you ain't gettin nowhere God took over man a man with a seventh grade education involved of greatest message you ever hit the earth and people looking at that don't make sense how can God use it don't God don't care about your opinion about things he did it took a prostitute into the city say come see a man shook the city I know them Pharisees but man y'all see what I'm saying those little things you said well what do you mean brother books that little small voice that talks if you listen if your bed everything you desire that's in the will of God he'll give it to you that's damn I fight on my knees that's where I fight I go to the man who fights for me and sometimes you just got to wait for the victory but the victory will always come sometime we'll move out move places or move there's life a god say stand here and you move like like the Prophet God did when told him that the Hat gotta be here and the old lady gotta be here and he moved before God he saw the vision he knew what God wanted but he moved before and God didn't let it happen until everything came back in order but when you move according to God's order you don't have to worry about nothing it's gonna all come this is war you can take your possession I believe we launder with Joshua's anointing Joshua's just another name for Jesus Jesus came and he possessed everything he even came and possessing death hell and the grave when you really want something the Bible said if you ask what's over you asking faith believing that you shall receive it he said you get it that's the way it is with God that's the way it is with believer we are not based our civilization is not based upon reasoning and and this modern day psychiatry no we are of a faith civilization and everything that we do should be based upon the faith and love of God when we work by faith we become victims Victor's like all say more than conquerors let us power by the God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy help us dear Jesus it's always about [Music] we fight daily but we can't fight about with our own strength you've given us the Holy Spirit you've given us your word which is the greatest weapon tree that that you could have given us but give us Grace and wisdom to know how to use these things in battle you told us Lord that when Satan comes in like a flood you will live up a standard against him we know Lord that once we're in Christ I mean in Christ sealed in the Holy Ghost nothing can harm us you see no more sin you see no more thoughts in us is it that is at that time that we stand virtuous before you learn help us to fight to enter into that place behind the curtain so we can close it Lord that will stand completely justified that will manifest Lord your perfection in this day help us dear Jesus let us not be wannabes Lord but give us grace Lord Jesus give us grace we feel the call we feel the pool we know what you're doing Lord you let us die to our wheel every day every moment of the day that you would be seen not us there's a matter what the world call us doesn't matter what others think help us dear Jesus granted long we think your father God for your grace and mercy in Jesus Christ's name Amy I'm telling you it's it's getting bad now I want y'all to know I do not have a cold I don't know why my nose you know but by God's grace we're doing well and thank you for your prayers while we were in Florida seriously I don't sometimes but anyway we got down there the big it's 40 degrees just things happen it rained I think the next two days it was 70 the first three days I went to bed in pain cuz I strained a muscle before I left it Oh hallelujah but you know I and all things give things then I got home I got on the plane coming back I didn't tell my wife but there was a elderly lady there flirting with me and she kept getting in my way and carrying on and then on the plane yeah uh on the plane you had the stewardess and what do you call the guys they were serving I had my ginger ale the kids a tow truck do you know how people doze off to sleep a lot of people sleeping so they started serving coffee and tea and milk water so when the guy come to me he says coffee tea or me and he hits me on top of all the stuff that I think I [Music] caught myself cuz I was giving it I was getting ready to give him the eye and instead I turned and I said lord I ain't looking at this man no more for the rest of the trip and I did but but the thing that gets me is because they have become so bold in their actions I did not and was not doing anything to encourage this man it just whatever he was doing if he was in his own time making sure but I'm gonna tell you something people of God it's not gonna get better it's going to get worse we have no rights we have no rights the only rights we have you love the Lord let's pout a word of Prayer father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to me for good to us you have been better to us that we have been to ourselves we are grateful because of the call that you based in our lives Lord whatever you do let us not come short of your blow no matter what it takes to get us there Lord we are depending on you to take us it's not by power not by might but by that spirit and father we are crying out for your grace and many will be left behind but we pray father God somehow you put it in us you reveal it unto us on how to enter into this place forgive us of our sins cleanse us from all our mattresses put a fire in our soul an unquenchable fire no matter if everybody else is falling asleep keep us awake keep us watchful that the thief non-cognitive bless his
