TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see God right he knew there was coming forth a day of resurrection in the last days right last 2000 years my redeemer shall stand upon the earth now listen no Wanda David cried out my flesh shall rest in hope because he will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will he leave his soul in Hell I love that hallelujah because if God could not allow Jesus real body its natural body to see corruption he will not allow us to see corruption who is his body hallelujah it got good see all of these things put back to Calvary then and you said it lays a complete salvation she excuse me in Jesus lays the completion or the complete of salvation the complete of divine healing if there is no divine healing now there is no resurrection of the day that doesn't take a scientist understand that hallelujah if God surely can't heal you he definitely can't get you about Anna GREs especially if you've been there for a long time is that Alright she we must look toward the promise that's what we got to do you can't look at the symptoms brothers sisters you this flash is evil you think you're gonna convert it it will never be converted hallelujah until God comes and change it so you gonna deal with this to Jesus come well praise God I pull of the holy goes well that's true but when you come to a statue of a perfect man then you were silence it yummy huh because that divine love conquers all that's the Bible that's the only way we'll be able to silence the devil because when the devil come with us at those things he can't accuse you he can't accuse your brother to you he can't even make your angry at your brother or your sister you hear me right because that love has captivated you so much you see the devil behind him it's amazing I'm excited you know how we were little children and we oh I can't hardly wait to I'll become an adult and then will become an adult which at all I just wish I could go back amen but in this case it's something in the bride of Jesus Christ that makes us groan you know we groaning right now we will literally literally groaning like God even save me from this place of Hell y'all to say it that way it is we know by God's grace that hell is blending into Earth amen doubt those two dimensions are bringing themselves together so you and I cannot expect it to get better it's going to get worse these Christians that we dealing with right now you know I don't know how we're gonna make it if the Church of God don't get down on their knees and pray that's where your victory I'm telling you the victory is in prayer you don't believe me go listen to the message what here at our Elijah he's got two of them and I tell you what it's in prayer and this is why the devil fights us so much because he doesn't want us to get up I don't know what call you a routine but he doesn't want you to get that prayer closet going hallelujah let me say like this even larger needed a cave you need one hallelujah shame Jezebel coming up to you right any larger rare from Jezebel when he didn't have the anointing with him who we look to his promise is that right see no matter listen no matter how much this and that and the other you got to have something strike you see what I'm saying in other words you gotta know when it when God strike you he's there you can jump you can shout you can do all you want to but until he changed your hearts mind you got to have a change in your hearts mind right he said listen he said you got to have something strike your brother vital that settles it forever that's faith Jesus is the high priest of your confession and whatever you confess that he'll do right if you say I'm a hypocrite that's what you are if you say I'm the Bride of Christ that's who you are and you may not even look like the Bride of Christ but you have angels standing by you waiting to hear you say it so they can move on the scene but you saw all Brotherhood's I don't have divine love but you know we need to start confessing it lord I've got divine love because when you start confessing it those angels have to bring something forth to put you in that position who you know out there in the world or any other church who can who can say they have divine love name it and claim it hallelujah you got to get real with this thing it is serious a lot of people look at symptoms and you say well brother Branham my hair is no no straighter I'd never be it'll never be as long as you look at it hey God then you don't came up for healing and you look and you said well God says your hand you you were healed in your arm cooking like that and you said well uh it ain't no straighter oh he said you'll never get it well you're looking at the symptoms hallelujah and that's the that's the truth I heard somebody else preach this it is so good they said oh you pray for your baby and your baby's temperature is 103 and you paint pray for the baby and then you go back to check it and see weathers went down you didn't have faith hallelujah and if it goes down you said where the Lord done he'll you have the Lord healed before the temperature went down under the temperature don't go down what do you do you still say he'll see but if you don't have that kind of faith take him to the doctor I'll play with it yeah don't hope you go get well you got to know something must strike you in order for you that's faith when that strikes you the devil has no chance why because God has given you a revelation that that baby will be healed I just don't like people playing with babies and playing you know with their own faith and no they ain't got it take it to the doctor talk about symptoms look at Jonah down in the belly of the whale if anybody could have had symptoms he had them back slidden had ties by ties behind him on the sea a storm coming up pitched him out whale swallowed him up went to the bottom row seeing fish in a fish went in and they will he fare he feeds he goes and resting in the bottom of the sea and there he was down there with a belly full of backslidden preacher well live down there on the bank down there under the sea a storm on the seatbacks land what a condition he was he looked this away it was whales belly he looked that away it was whales belly everywhere he looked it was whales belly you know what he said he said I'm not looking at the whales belly they're lying Vanity's holiday we huh I'm not going to look at this not this it's a lying vanity y'all better hear me your flesh is aligned vanity God conquer death hell and the grave for you it's a liar it's the shadow of death hallelujah but I feel no evil hallelujah you see this is where we must understand Satan is trying to deceive us and lessen our faith by our action by what we look in that hallelujah oh come on somebody when I was growing taller I did not see myself growing taller until I had to perhaps here try up here pea system something made me know I had grown taller but I never could see that hallelujah so how if you can't notice it in the natural how you notice it in the spiritual you gotta trust God except the Lord builds a house made that labor Labor's in vain right except the watchman you know what listen you gotta understand God is in one who's your watchman he must be if you the watchman now the Bible said pray watch and pray we're watching and praying right but you got to understand that there are angels that are commissioned to watch and pray for you just okay lying fantasies he said Lord once more look at your holy temple why did you see the way he's seeing God's temple right that's what we need to realize him and we must always look to Jesus Christ and Calvary hallelujah when that looks like amen these are overwhelming us and it looked like we're not gonna get out of this place hallelujah we must realize Amen that there was one who has already paid the price and he's already told you that your names are on the Lamb's Book of Life you gotta have faith it's true because some of us I know when out here thinking well praise the Lord I'm gonna be perfect and we all of a sudden went in that natural mode thinking you go conquer the devil in your natural knows that he knows you just gone on a full ride the only way you'll be able to talk to him is through prayer hallelujah oh because prayer changes things you cannot add a cubit to your statue it takes the Lord Jesus Christ he is the builder but you got to want the building you know I mean you gotta want it you gotta ask for it every day you ought to have that that statue of a perfect man before you Lord add to me don't you can add it but how you going how's it gonna be added if you don't ask him with sincerity this is what I want hello not when the trials come don't want about it you ask for it right because these virtues are not something that's so freely given to you you've got to battle it is a victory hallelujah and I won't God to show me where I am so I know where I need to go that's the beauty of it remember brother Branham told a joke to one of his friends and his friend went back and told his wife to joke and his wife got offended I know brother Branham ain't telling no jokes he said God did that so that he could stop joking yeah it became a stumbling block you see what I'm saying he said no I was wrong by doing that ya hear what I'm saying so it it's God duty to put something in your way to make you stumble or fall so you know where you are maybe we're doing something we don't know it's wrong God will it's his duty to make us know that it's wrong that's what I'm saying he allowed it and that's what the problem said God allowed that to happen to show me right I don't want to think I'm standing in a knot you know I look at those those are virtues you see what brother boots that's all in the hole of those absolutely it's only one seed in you but you are the that's responsible when it comes to letting God right because remember when when the Jews came back from Babylon and they were building the wall and symbolic them demons amen was right out there to stop them from building it hallelujah guess what Amen you got to realize that everybody they say they're in the message is not in the message because these were have Jews some of them don't you love the Lord you gotta watch who's trying to stop you from getting to the top now you tell you know now we do we do experience not talk about individuals we're talking about spirits accept the Lord feels the house I'm glad he's building it cuz I know if he builds it it's gonna be perfect is that right he's the one that's packing the boxcar hallelujah and he's gonna rather you till nothing else nothing in you can be rattled that means the storms and the trials going to come until you become a Superman or superwoman but either way you have Christ in you that's what we want we want the Lord to build a house right he said when the temple was dedicated Solomon prayed I said Lord when the Holy Ghost come in and that fire settles down behind the holy place if that people be in trouble anywhere and pray then you hear from heaven listen you and I must understand nothing can stop your prayer once you pray it doesn't matter if you at the bottom of the sea in a whale's belly right because when you pray you say well how do you know I mean how did Jonah uh-uh-uh-uh-uh know that he was facing the temple the prophet of God said when he started to pray that the prayer made the whale turned toward the temple oh my god and you and I was realized by the grace of God nothing can stop your prayer hello even our prayers some of our prayers God should take us to the grave right now your prayers still goes on and God will answer those prayer nothing can stop your prayer hallelujah is that Alright she don't believe that God hurts Solomon's prayer and he said I look to your temple and it made that oh well kind of feel funny and God put an oxygen tank down there and kept him alive three days and took him right on over to Nineveh you and I have no idea what that was like I don't think any of us want that experience either hey hey so you and I must understand except the Lord build the house and I'm gonna keep saying that because after for the Jesse preached that just struck me that scripture right there and I was telling him that he thought about that that's Scripture you know applying I'm like yes I mean we can't do this God can it takes humility it takes a man to Humble himself to say I can't that's that's a good place to be because when you go before God says law I don't can't do it I don't know how to do it then God will come you said what brother books are you certain see I'm gonna tell you something and this is not to make it sound bad but it's the truth I knew people who was in the thunders and they said that the seven virtues are was the seven thunders and all of that and I could see where they're going with it but you know they what they did they did some things with their shouldn't and what was the people doing they were trying to add these virtues and just call shipwreck it caused confusion it caused legal listen it caused pride because when you think you have achieved something then it has a tendency of looking down on somebody else but you see when God does it you know it's the grace of God and then your love extend toward the brother who's not reached it yet because the true statue of a christ will not bring : ISM worker you know what I mean colonising right when a person wants to denominator selves and put themselves in such a colony that is against the world of the Iowa even to bring division among the church is that right was it Peter dude I can't remember the scripture supposing that they had the Holy Ghost a true man of God will not divide a church if he disagree he leads but when he divides her charge and make disciples unto himself he is not under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost Oh what are you saying brother remember Moses was chosen by God Dave didn't Korah and when they brought in heresies trees and dogmas and what happened they all died it just making sense so you understand that the more you are you get closer to God the more your denominational walls will fall hello come on somebody see how used to be in those denominations different ones and I was a Christian being you say no you wasn't yes Iowa I'll be honest with you I was a Christian before the foundation of the world my Christianity didn't start with the Baptist Church you know and that's what we fail to see if somebody is he like today elected and none of your thoughts against them can change anything you can't tell me that God can't bring a man out of a Baptist Church right on into this message took me out of the Baptist Church out from the Baptist Church I went to the Methodist Church from the Methodist Church I went to the Catholic Church from the Catholic Church I went to the Apostolic Church and Here I am still a journey but God led me in all of that ah to realize there are differences but know that everybody that love Lord and have confessed with their mouth and believed in their heart to the saving of their soul is say wood now they don't trust in a denomination they're not trusting their bishops or their pastors they're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't mean they're make rapture but they are saved according to the Word of God they are and you can't take that from them either look dressing like well there's a lot of people that's dressing holy and filthy hallelujah come on is that Scripture Oh Pharisees and Sadducees and all of them y'all looking at me like I'm crazy get anything out with gamma that makes you holy it's the n-word that gives you the holiness now if you holy you got hold it goes you're gonna begin the dress holy y'all understand what I'm saying you're not gonna say how I got the holy girls like I should like you should have because listening holy goes where we're talking about now you might be a babe just came to Christ you don't I mean you may not know about sanctification right but if you got the real Holy Ghost he gonna tell you that ain't right no man had to teach me about shorts God showed me that took that come off me in the public ran to my house I was in swimming trunks getting ready to do my favorite thing swim oh lord have mercy and I had just been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus by early I'm just telling you that's me that's what God did for me now let's go on this is something that brother Randy and I was discussing today and I said I've got to you that first King 6 & 7 in the house when it was in building was built of strong made ready before it was brought thinner so that there was neither hammer nor axe no any tools iron heard in the house while it was in building that means no man had anything to do with this building no man's hand God had already cut them strong hallelujah and when they were transported everybody every strong I don't know how they had the blueprint laid out but every stone fit exactly talk about a jigsaw puzzle oh wow and I've been to Egypt you know that that layout that they had that really reflected the Sun and everything else you know they don't took that goal and everything off that so you've got all this rough stone and when you see how huge some of these stones are you think to yourself there is no way anybody could have done this without some kind of laser supernatural thing I don't even know if they used horses and cots to bring those big stones from weather I don't know how they did it but my point is they had a destiny and that destiny no matter where they were built or cut away wherever they came from they had a destiny and that destiny was right there in Egypt who scientists and I don't know how true this is but they said scientists say that where this this this this a pyramid stands it's where the real Garden of Eden was I don't know how true that is all I know is that Jesus visited it he went right into Egypt before he came to Bethlehem and Jerusalem or whatever you understand me my point is Amit when it comes to the stones there are no extra stones they couldn't say well oh I like this song better than the other no sir and they could say well this stone is not shaped and cut right every strong though they were cut differently was right hallelujah so you understand God don't have any cookie cutters we're all different we're cut different but we're part of the same body yeah you know so many people believe that if people don't don't tell believe this message they're lost well what happened to the foolish virgins they don't believe it they don't believe it enough to get the Holy Ghost and that's what real belief is to know that you need more of God right I mean you look at this thing is well what about those ones who never heard some way I saw where brother Brown said that God will deal with their consciousness even if it's a tribe in Africa wherever they are whatever their laws were and those that stood for the word I was close to what God commanded and the people obey those laws grace is given to them in that okay so I want you to understand no man's I can't cut rich I can't chisel him ain't nothing I can do to help him it's the invisible carpenter it's Jesus Christ right oh you might say what brother Brooks I just wish you to have more patience but you can't give it give me no more patience you just got to have patience that deal with me not having patience y'all hear what I'm saying I just wish you know you know maybe you know it would be too easy but God won't somebody who loves disappearing huh because that's what it's all about the building of the statute of crisis for Christ amen is when God was appearing listen I believe brother I said you came him understand the seven seals without understanding the seven churches and each one of the church ages had virtue all the way up they had to meet the criteria he said even when it came to Paul's day or Ephesus he said up no he said Luther he said Luther he said all those people that came out with Luther but everybody didn't get they didn't come to Luther's measurement the just shall live by faith no he said some of them carried on but they didn't have it so what are you saying I'm saying there's a lot of people in this message won't won't reach perfect law oh I'm in the message but you got to reach perfect law how do I read see that's the point yeah God reveals to you like he did joke it's a revelation that God gives you that you gonna make it he even reveals to you how to make it otherwise you just like the Lutheran's who thought they were Lutheran's everybody that follow West the West Wesley didn't come up to a place where they were sanctified no but they were Wesleyan see but when God reveals to you and how you know he's gonna reveal to you cuz when you really receive the Holy Ghost that I think God gives you the real Holy Ghost hallelujah you said well did I speak in tongues you don't have to that run up and down the ad you don't have to but when it strikes your soul that you say nobody can take it from you and that is the foundation of faith that takes you up this ladder but the world doesn't know that only the bride she's the one that's adorning herself and making herself ready you sure what are you saying yeah there's a little work you got to do guarding a little just pull you through the two that barrel II meant after that that a rancher son that Rancher son Amen when he says I want you to marry me she didn't just say well I'm I was sitting in my lounge chair and wait to he returned Oh she worked and saved her nickels hallelujah so you got a little work to do right oh come on somebody the Bible said if you resist the devil here flee from you huh you said there's another story remember the learning lady who went overseas I've got what country with Ireland or somewhere she was an artist and she had the guy had proposed to her and while she was in school everybody went out partying and getting drunk like Americans do I think it was France at whatever world but the point is this old man this elderly man saw her that she wasn't part of these groups and one day he saw her standing at the fence looking looking out Westwood and he came he says I basically I'm not trying to pry on your business you know but I want to know why you're not joining everybody else and she says because over there there's a certain land and in that certain man there's a certain city and in that certain city there's a certain boy and she says oh we are and he's kept he's been faithful to me and I'm gonna be faithful to him oh if that don't strike you anybody know let me tell you God has been faithful that's what I desire I want to be faithful to him huh come on he proposed I said yes I want to be faithful and she said one of these old days we'll meet each other again lord have mercy you know one thing I know about the prophet of God he could tell it really good he put you right in the scene huh whoo hallelujah God is good to us she met through seven 21 through 7 I let me read this it says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall I shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in that name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now iniquity is when you know to do good and you do with it not hallelujah and what they did is that they rejected the prophet or the message is that right they did that's why all the denominations are suffering because their leaders rejected the message of the hour had their leaders accepted it we probably be in a rapture by now but if the blind lead us lead the blind they both shall fall in the ditch y'all hear what I'm saying so you look at these things to a lord Lord huh yeah and you cannot you can't say see this is why you know we can see why brother Melanie warns us you know it's you know I love the signs I love the wonders I love all of those things you know he tells us identification of a church we're supposed to have these things but he says basically don't major on a minor right all these things are good but everybody that's doing these things are not right they're not right in their heart it's the same anointing falling on the wheat and the tear but understand that you're your biggest victories that your name has been written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's why he told his disciples don't come running to me with all that noise and noise is good but I think a lot of times people think noise is where God is he can be a noise if he want to be but he's not always in it is that right you go to some of these churches they could make more knowledge than we can but they got no word and God is his word right so he's all of the knowledge but the absence of the world means that he's put out the church he's not there right but when you worship God you must worship Him where in spirit and in truth and the only way that you can worship him as you got to have the Holy Ghost everything else is just potential right now they're doing that casting out that was Judas cast that's why the property that said Judas even cast out Devils and laid hands on the sea and inwardly he was a devil but here God has given us something greater than just all of these things and here's the eye Elijah the probably God said it thundered Eli didn't moon he said knowledge the wind came he'll I didn't knew he said then came a steel of small boys hallelujah then he answered y'all hear what I'm saying and you saw what do you mean brother Brooks you can't hear the voice and that's the voices in here how do you go here the resurrection if you the resurrection is not in you hallelujah yes a prophet of God became the still small voice of that day but now that scroll must be in you because he said eat the whole book for the as prophesy again huh is that okay see you must build your house upon a rock that house that rock is what listen I can't explain to you why I'm dry I can't explain you why I believe that nobody's gonna take it from me I don't care how many fall just how many times I falter Amen nobody can take that from me that's the way your attitude should be hallelujah that's like telling my son water whoever Gabriel you that's not your daddy hallelujah I don't care how much you look like and that's not your dad you understand what I'm saying Gabrus a man something really wrong with you say but if you want to go scientifically let's get us a DNA alright that's what I tell the devil you want to go scientifically let's go DNA is that right yeah that's the truth too probably gotta say God pulls your blood out of you and gives you a blood transfusion you may not be able to see him at the devil knows it is that Alright oh come on except the Lord builds the house the Labour's labor in vain you know what I'm saying God is the contractor he's got the blueprint he knows exactly what needed in this building you understand me and every one of our battles are different right and we don't have the same battles you know I'm be honest with you mines are bad but I don't want yours I don't I don't know how what kind of battles you have him I'm having time with my own like I heard somebody and then people carrying the cross right carrying different crosses everybody had their cross and then when they came to a bridge you know everybody had you know different woman had done cut their cross off to make it lighter it was so huge that the cross world but everybody nobody wanted to carry that that big cross and in at the end of the day everybody had them cut their piece of cross off except that one man and he his cross was the only one that could bind the breach his cause was the only one they could fit everybody else was too short see what I'm saying so it's not a good thing to cut off your cross let thy will be done Lord whatever I've got a something whatever I've got to go through so be it don't spare me from nothing I want my clothes to fit I don't know I don't I do not want to come up short you understand me now if a person came to this message and rejected it folks they're lost I'm gonna talk about that I'm come up people who didn't know much about it or whose doctor and somebody you know they never understood and never really believed it you know I mean because of the way they've been taught you know God gives great therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock and the old faith virtue knowledge temperance right T whosoever do with these same right so what were you saying if I hired a contractor I don't have to do nothing he builds the house I just come in at Mary what he's built right and Jesus is the contractor of this house he's the Builder right and and what he wants in us is to glorify Him and whatever stage you are in oh that is so Lord I'm so thankful how many times people are things that come your way and you remember in the back of your head had I not been converted this is would have been my reaction anybody know what I'm talking about and because of that you know you've grown from somewhere like later say I ain't what I ought to be I'm not what I used to be in or not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I want used to be y'all know that y'all know how to say it but my party has a opposite that it shows that he's calling these countries come from somewhere and how I know maybe I have not reached there where I want to in his own display because token must be on display divine love is not something that you cloak it must be seen that seal must be seen on the front and the back side right and you know you look at this aliens or brothers hey all like I said it's a reign to sin the flood came the wind blew and beat upon the house don't you know you and I the reason why we're not backspin is not because we have been so perfect it's only because God who started the good work in you its faithful to complete once he started he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you ha call it a car he will make it happen hallelujah absolutely whoo everyone that hears these sayings of mine you've got to trust God if nobody else nobody else it started with the thief on the cross he didn't even know much about Christ but he believed him he trusted in life and it ends up the same way trust the Lord with all your heart hallelujah hey how many times the prophet of God was owner on the platform and and people could have been healed member that's one lady who was dying and he told her she was gonna die and she didn't believe it right or she could have been healed this to case one case he said I can't pray for you because you can ready to go home and then later didn't want to believe it as soon as she got to her chance she fell dead huh and this other one he tried to get her to have faith she wouldn't she came all the way up then he told everything and she just couldn't not grasp it and he's basically trying to tell her if you don't even though I said what I said if you don't your faith will grasp it you're gonna die guess what she died see that's why he said sometimes he's a duster the law you yield then he says according to your faith God is perfect God can't do nothing for you you get over I don't know how I'm gonna be perfect I don't care how I'm not bringing back a bad report you understand me those those spas gave us so we cannot do it I'm saying we can do it I don't care how big got Giants I got in my life God knows how to slay every one of them I got it with one stone he they've begun the good working it's papers are completed kill every giant ah when he's gonna complete it that's his own business hallelujah y'all don't believe y'all need perfect love remember brother Adam said his wife even told him it's perfect love over here bill this is what you've been preaching old it goes all your life did you know that he himself went through changes before he could even see you know the stature of a man God had to take him through changes to let him see basically why people who were Christians who recall said had the Holy Ghost was failing and they were failing he said I've had patients with you for 33 years some of y'all still bobbling your hair and doing that can you imagine right in the face of the Prophet they still cutting their hair I can't I can't imagine it but he said I've had patients with you right but now I'm going to tell you something Israel died under sanctification because God was requiring though the cross over the in the daughter hello oh you can't stay there you got to move on is what you're saying we cannot stay where we are and listen I am so glad is individuals huh it's individuals it's you in God me and God nobody can hold me back nobody can hold you back okay just a bit okay I'm just gonna will bring something and it will see wonder what God is something I've never seen another thing brotherbrother Jesse brought it out and he was dealing with the mysteries in our always even in denominations what those fragments mean lies God collecting fragments pieces of bread you know what was it those pieces of bread belongs to whatever loaf it was but those those twelve fragments represented twelve apostles with twelve twelve governing powers that was the Beast listen let me read it let me read it amen and when Jesus knew it he said unto them why reason ye because you have no bread Percy ye not yet neither understand have you not your heart yet hardened having I see you not heaven ears hear you not and do you not remember now he's already told them says listen I knew you before the foundation of the world you was with me before the founders were and this these laws represented Christ and there was a peace peace peace so that bread was Christ and twelve pieces of it was to say you was with me when I was a whole loaf hallelujah but it was a mystery because nobody knew in the Jewish age kudos twelve disciples were and what they would mean in the future they were mysteries yet they were there with Christ even as Christ was a mystery they were a mystery and those twelve disciples were the foundation of faith y'all hear what I'm saying and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full took ye up and they said seven that means they were going to be seven mysterious angels or servants like there were twelve who would carry missing who was carrying the word and you and I we look at this thing issue what brother was how can I done it there well why is he ask him why is it that you don't understand do we not understand communion communion is one brain broken up into so many pieces that's why he said don't leave nothing eat it all because every piece represents some body some part of the body hallelujah Moses said I leaving nothing behind and when we take communion we're literally identifying ourselves with the loaf who is Christ Jesus himself this is my body hallelujah so when you take a piece of the bed that bread which is 11 you will say I am part of the body of Christ and that wine means Holy Ghost amen I'm accepting the blood stimulation hello why because the Prophet God talks about those 12 mysteries of the Bible hmm and those 12 mysteries are the twelve parables or the parables that Jesus spoke of there in the book in the gospel I can't say enough but my point is this did you know that you are a mystery people say what brother works where you get that from I got it from the author that brother that so we're brother you don't even know your Bible he said I don't have to know my Bible I know the author though he'll tell me he'll tell me you know and we look at these things and we fail to see Amen that even God does not expect us to be parents God want us everything the property of God's has spoken that was Christ in him talking to the bride of Jesus Christ and guess what he tells her things that he doesn't tell other people sometimes God has told me things and I open my mouth and I get in trouble cuz nobody see what I'm talking about and I wasn't fine everybody it was for me and I had no business telling it ooh I'm a closed on there second Peter 1 through 4 Lord I want you to people I want you to understand how our earth are we're going to get listen when you see what it what it what it means to add or take away that means you're making something different than what it really is but it see but but my point is is when you taking the Word of God and you seeing it because brother Branham done drop some nuggets here and some nuggets there and all you do is go through the scriptures and you find these things and what he's doing and what he's saying and you bringing it you're not adding to it you're literally opening up a meant by the same Holy Ghost what he's been bringing that makes it clearer to you it's not Jesus Christ the saying he told those saints of God he says listen I say unto you if you look at a woman in lust in your heart you've already committed adultery was he adding to the word because all know in the word all he had he had was that if you commit adultery right but he took it to the spiritual realm and he showed us what it really is if I don't take it to the spiritual realm and tell you and show you who you are how are you gonna know it it takes God to do that no man can do it whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature let me tell you something if we continue without revelation say everything brother man don't say it becomes like a catechism you don't even know what you're talking about what you just saying it just like these denominational churches that they have written whoever wrote it might have been spiritual I don't know but the people that saying it I heard I witnessed a message of a person a lady and she was a Lutheran she said well I have the Catechism like it was gonna save her I left for their web given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises and I said like this by the grace of God I will not put my soul on the line trying to give you something that I'd believe that God didn't give me wherever are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by ye by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness it's the brotherly kindness charity and for these and for for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither see in this what people what people do when you start reading this thing they kind of correlate and and process it in their minds and I'm not saying that this is here but when you start talking you can't even say the word thunders when you say it's not the word on this part of this message you say thunders everybody think Utah Cobra didn't have no no no what you call it um huh well who said it copyright on this message Laval didn't have a copyright either none of them had copyright then you listen and I tell you the truth you might think I'm I'm gonna say it anyway if those brethren had looked on that unwritten word like the Prophet told him we wouldn't have never had this confusion in the beginning he said stay right here and look up on it and all those preachers began to walk away by with their own revelation and they brought confusion in this thing because they the ones that began to what to colonize and break the thing up I got it I hunt with him and I fish with him and they did all that stuff but brother brems Edwin that's future bride come on the see he talks about it there is a spiritual bride and I'm one of them hmm but if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in that the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the round up brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure that's the only way you can make it for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an interest shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and what that ministry was a man was Malachi for who God used to open up this message right now he's telling us he's telling this is in 1962 before the seals are open right and he takes us through the church ages in the church agency tells us of every Church what would require to them how they worked how they did this how they did this yet but God has some well against him something against this right the whole theme behind this this message was you have left your first love you did the same thing he did you left your first love right and God is calling us back to repentance repentance Awadh Jesus is not a thing he's a person and you and I supposed to know this person oh you said well I got a Holy Ghost but this hold ago supposed to talk to you hmm he's supposed to talk to you the whole thing about it is Christ in you the hope of glory now I tell you what has happened to me in the time that I shut-in you know I had listen to Elijah here's died Elijah all I listened to was a few tape different tapes and in statute of a personal man and I've seen this in a way that I've never seen it before and all I know is is something that will guarantee you heaven if you allow God to be able if you allow God to sanctify you if you allow God amen to build you up to brotherly kindness and temperance and patience and godliness all of these things which will be caught which will require death to you every one of these places amen you got to die that God's temperance can be seen brotherly kindness is not oh he just don't know if he hadn't met me ten years ago he would have got it that is not brotherly kindness that's not God virtue because virtue would not allow you to even think that way it just happens right so you and I must understand there's a lot of work to do but we don't already pass the first test some of us might even be at virtue how many of y'all have prayed for people that you felt a little weak before I am that's virtue that's where God they took virtue out of you that's something you gave your power your whole egos of that right they even say scientists say that when you lay hands on the sick they've seen it light pass from one to the next that is virtue you got knowledge right knowledge is easy all the word is right amen to everyone right and temperance is not just your temper yeah that's what it is just having control letting God have control you so wrapped up and people screaming at you you don't even hear them almost you hear them but you're not affected by the atmosphere all right y'all know what that is Oh patience is what we all need we need some old faces they oh my god they gave me the holy ghost yet we all needed the Lord I've been praying for this divine love patience you wait on it how many years Abraham waited for the baby mmm oh you think about it this is why I love Israel how many years have been waited for the Messiah and they still believe he's coming look at them I'm like woo you know I can't imagine when the Holy Ghost ate them folks what its gonna be like mercy hmm come on running over running through troops and all that oh you're gonna hear some bales for real Oh a lot of this prayed that God give us a little piece of the action by looking over the bed there are no people that as faithful as those people you understand what I'm saying they don't have nothing pretty much other than the law I've seen him in the air I don't seen him in the airport in the corner reading there whatever with them little hats on any time of the day I mean just little hats I don't know a box that's what I think it got Scrolls in them or something but these people they're not a shame in what has happened to the bride I say brother look at us you know people are shame to be holy anymore look holy they don't they want to be like I said sexy holiness is no such thing but that's what all the girls that's what they won't man you know they want the perm hand all of the kind of stuff and you know dude it all up anything nothing only looking nice but it's wrong when it take away from holiness is okay one more coat number let you go for the night I'm sorry I didn't mean to keep you so long what here's the I Elijah he's it we can testify jump up and down and sing and everything like that but until God makes us in such a condition till we can recognize one another as brothers until all malice Envy strife and everything's going out of us our jumping shouting and praising God organizing speaking in tongues and healing the sick and performing miracles and everything else will never amount to nothing come back and wait in the cave till we have heard the still small voice that calls us to the service of God oh how we meet it how the world needs it we need that he says name God will provide boom all of the stuff we're doing whoo that struck me - all of that and you can't even love your brother knowing you want to recognize him as if he'd belong to a camp we don't even want to recognize him as a brother because even you know he believes that you know but you know where I foundation where it's Calvary there's somebody to do away with kaveri he's not a brother but as long as Calvary is being emphasized the blood of Jesus Christ and the grace saves you that's a brother he said all of us colonising he was fussing at the people in 1960 whenever in 59 he says listen he says here it is God trying to move with the people and the more he moved the more these people are colonizing on that one tape he's literally praying for a woman free child and he said oh you a woman preacher and you just gave up your church because you found out you had cancer he said don't give up your church who how many of us would have told somebody that you come to you got to give it up you don't know what God is doing I heard him I like what he did he told her and that was God said that that wasn't him as a man that was God's and don't you give up your church now explain that word to me see we just things in the wrong way what you going to do with Amy McPherson with the Prophet respected with your graveyard parade and all that's down myself and he talks about how he respected her woman preacher who lived in his time he met her priest at her church oh she didn't make it to heaven hello huh brother Branham wasn't wasting his time he was a man led of God see I'm not a I'm not condoning it we know it's wrong but our attitude has to become better than what they do I heard the Prophet God said he's standing with anybody that's staying with Jesus regardless to doctrines oh and you know usual work but that's where perfectly love is gonna bring you to it it's gonna bring you there and you gotta want it high there's no body that I know of that I want to see go to hell nobody some people do what they do because they don't know you think that lady I don't know what happened at the end of the day but he said here's our line what do you realize you and all I'm saying is these people we blessed above measures we are blessed and I know that you and I don't understand a lot of things but one thing we must understand except the Lord builds a house we label anything and who is that I heard preaching the other day maybe Ben Jessie Satan will cause irreparable because we don't see much progress or something you know what you see Gideon saw himself as a coward when God called him that mighty man availeth now which one which report you would like to have God called me broad yes thank you hallelujah I already exceeded every bit of it I'll take it Lord let Stan and that's all I'm saying when the word of God is being preached if you don't understand it whatever ask God if you see yourself in a place and God gonna allow these things that come upon you to try you and test you but you don't give up you acknowledge your transgressions and you said well Lord I want to do better but I need you to help me you're the Builder of the house now that we know he's the one that's building it we need to tell him we know now that you're the Builder I can't do it Lord but you can do it in me and Lord no matter what it takes I want to be perfect like your words they'd be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and the only way I know I could be perfect is that the perfect one of I you love the Lord because it makes it easier for yourself but I'm gonna tell you something when you realize what you need you don't increase your prayer your prayer lives need to be increased y'all hear what I'm sayin not just mine too right because when you realize you you know something the only way these these these are can I say it like stones are these stones would be laid in you or however they virtuals gonna be late it's gonna take prayer because everything has been so cut not even raised a play can get Oh God oh please do it for me oh do it for you you love the Lord
