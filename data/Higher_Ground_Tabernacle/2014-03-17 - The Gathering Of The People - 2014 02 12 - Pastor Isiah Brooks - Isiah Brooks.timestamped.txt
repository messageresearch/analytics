[3:08] feel a a real burden in my heart and I
[3:12] pray father God that you will grant us
[3:15] victory in this message that it will not
[3:18] just go to the heads of the people but
[3:21] to the heart of the people that they may
[3:24] see that we are now living in a A
[3:26] desperate time a Time where Satan is on
[3:31] the
[3:32] rampant but Lord you say when the enemy
[3:35] come in like a flood you would lift up a
[3:38] standard against Lord we pray Have Thine
[3:42] Own Way in Jesus Christ's name we
[3:48] pray yes you may be
[3:54] seated I'd like to entitle this message
[3:57] tonight the Gathering of the people
[4:01] people you know I was reading in numbers
[4:04] 21 16-8 it was talking about uh Israel
[4:08] and and basically going into the
[4:10] promised land and uh you know they had
[4:14] encountered a lot of things when they
[4:15] were in the
[4:17] wilderness and uh we find that Israel
[4:20] were getting ready to uh uh further go
[4:23] further in in the work in the will of
[4:25] the Lord but they had to cross uh
[4:28] through a land which was
[4:31] uh and of course we find that in in
[4:33] their travel uh Israel needed to water
[4:38] right and you know and let let me just
[4:40] read it uh numbers 21:16 and from then
[4:43] they went to bear that is the well where
[4:47] of the Lord spake unto Moses gather the
[4:50] people together and I will give them
[4:52] water now when I that scripture caught
[4:56] my attention because it was God
[5:00] Gathering the people and he had promised
[5:03] them water now watch this the 17th verse
[5:06] said when Israel
[5:07] sang uh when and and then Israel sang
[5:11] this song spring up oh well now I would
[5:15] just wondering when I heard that whether
[5:18] or not this is where they was inspired
[5:20] spring up oh well within my soul you
[5:23] know because when I read that read that
[5:25] that's what I thought it didn't sound
[5:27] like a a song of uh that was a blues but
[5:32] it sound like it was a joyful thing they
[5:34] were really happy about this well and
[5:38] and the Bible tells us that the princes
[5:41] dug the wells the Nobles the rulers uh
[5:44] the the uh Governors those who were in
[5:47] charge it wasn't that the people drug
[5:50] the well the the the the big guys they
[5:53] the spiritual ones they are the ones who
[5:56] dug the well and and the people amen
[5:59] benefited from it and uh you know the
[6:03] Bible tells us that they actually after
[6:06] digging the well uh they were directed
[6:08] by the lawgivers and they uh uh with
[6:11] their staffs and and the Bible said they
[6:14] went from the Wilderness to man and and
[6:18] if I'm pronouncing that right uh but
[6:21] that word means gift of Jehovah see they
[6:25] traveled they were from the Wilderness
[6:27] and yet they had to dig well God gave
[6:30] them water and then they travel to
[6:33] because you can't go anywhere without
[6:36] water hello somebody yes now I want you
[6:38] to understand this is natural water we
[6:41] speaking of but Jesus Christ is working
[6:43] with the spiritual water amen yes is
[6:45] that right it will it is a gift which is
[6:49] the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah
[6:51] come on somebody now I I just want to
[6:54] say this because we we talking about the
[6:58] Gathering of the people brother bam
[7:00] talks about it he he basically said that
[7:03] you know at every Junction there was
[7:05] always a gathering of the people and the
[7:08] Gathering of the people were always
[7:09] gathered by the prophets
[7:12] amen when when God was getting ready to
[7:16] speak brother bam talks about how that
[7:18] God always speaks at Junctions at every
[7:22] Junction God will speak and he said amen
[7:26] according to the uh message that this
[7:29] was was the junction of all
[7:31] Junctions and that God was going to
[7:34] speak and of course God did speak in
[7:37] this Junction but a lot of people didn't
[7:40] hear but nevertheless it still was a
[7:43] gathering of the people and when I read
[7:46] that I thought about how that God Jesus
[7:50] Christ himself came to Earth and he was
[7:53] a prophet of all prophets but at that
[7:56] time there was a junction and that
[7:59] Junction was to gather the people to God
[8:04] and I wondered how come many times Jesus
[8:07] himself would say I can do nothing
[8:10] except the father show me wow Jesus he
[8:13] does the work and I do it hither to and
[8:17] he yet again he looked and he told
[8:20] Philip when you see me you see the
[8:23] father but he wanted them to see that
[8:27] they're drawing
[8:30] was by the
[8:31] Father which was the Holy Ghost and he
[8:34] was basically trying to get them to see
[8:37] that because he even said I'm going to
[8:40] die I'm going to leave you and he said
[8:44] it's good that I leave you he said but
[8:46] when I leave you he said the father he
[8:50] will send another conf and he's going to
[8:53] send this comforter in my name amen
[8:57] right and this comforter he shall tell
[9:00] you of all things to come now he was
[9:03] basically appointing the people just
[9:05] like Moses just like Joshua all of them
[9:09] at their Junctions were trying to get
[9:11] the people to see the invisible God Amen
[9:15] see because the Gathering was not to
[9:17] Moses the Gathering was not to Joshua
[9:20] the Gathering amen was not to the man
[9:23] Jesus Christ remember because Paul said
[9:28] we don't know him Jesus Christ no more
[9:32] after the flesh am he was working with
[9:34] the invisible God which we call the Holy
[9:37] Ghost yall understand me so we realize
[9:41] amen that brother B goes on to say in
[9:43] the the the the hour the Father the hour
[9:47] has come and and I didn't get a chance
[9:49] to write all of these things down but he
[9:51] said the time has come to circumcise the
[9:54] church and call out this foolishness
[10:00] it goes on and say the time has come so
[10:02] go back to the old
[10:05] Landmark the time has come for the
[10:09] outpouring the time has come for the
[10:12] Gathering of the people the time is come
[10:16] for Jesus to come the time will be here
[10:20] to give out rewards now I I just took
[10:24] those things out of that particular
[10:26] quote so if you want to read the full
[10:28] quote amen by the grace of God that is
[10:31] is from the message Father The Hours
[10:33] come which is 10
[10:36] 256 my reason amen for uh bringing these
[10:40] things out is because you know and I
[10:42] know spiritually that something is
[10:45] acting here and it's not a positive
[10:49] thing I was talking with a brother the
[10:51] other day when I first came here to uh
[10:54] uh uh uh Iowa I can remember the unity
[10:58] that this little church had with each
[11:01] other and everybody cared I can remember
[11:04] the times when we would get out of
[11:06] church everybody would go and fellowship
[11:09] you know even though we didn't have much
[11:11] you know everybody would go Fellowship
[11:13] around something at a restaurant you
[11:16] know what I mean now now that's
[11:18] Gathering Together hello now don't get
[11:22] quiet on me because it's the truth yes
[11:25] it's the truth when this church get out
[11:27] we very very we can get a Unity even at
[11:30] the pit
[11:32] prayer right and we can hardly get a a a
[11:37] fellowship out there because everybody's
[11:41] racing to their own
[11:44] destiny right it's true everybody got
[11:46] their own agenda and you see that's not
[11:49] what it's all about people one of these
[11:51] old days you going to wish you had one
[11:53] another around and all you will ever
[11:56] remember is the days that you could have
[11:59] had the fellowship there's no big eyes
[12:02] there's no new but understand ain't
[12:05] nobody going to Sprint the catch you
[12:07] going outside that
[12:12] door right I'm I'm going read something
[12:15] here y y mind well that's how I'm going
[12:17] talk tonight because I believe we got to
[12:19] have more unity and I believe amen we
[12:22] got to care more about each other than
[12:23] we've been doing in the past right y'all
[12:27] hear what I'm saying my point is this
[12:29] we're too
[12:32] private right and we care more about our
[12:35] natural families than we do
[12:37] here now I'm going say let this mind be
[12:40] in you because Jesus said who is my
[12:42] brother my sister my
[12:45] mother hello somebody now the mind of
[12:48] Jesus is to love his body
[12:51] more than his own natural family so you
[12:55] haven't arrived yet until you can love
[12:59] the family of God above your natural
[13:04] family somebody
[13:06] SH now I'm just you know my point is
[13:09] this it's got to be nobody will stay
[13:12] here if they don't feel the listen even
[13:14] if you getting SP by the word but if a
[13:18] person can know that you love them
[13:20] they'll
[13:22] stay I remember and and you not y know
[13:25] windy chair you know she goes everywhere

[13:37] mean I was I was hitting everything from

[13:41] everything you name I mean it was hard
[13:43] for the Saints to sit there
[13:46] right all of a sudden even after service
[13:49] she stood up
[13:51] I'm I thought to myself because
[13:54] preaching that hard I never did see her
[13:57] you I thought all I had was those who
[14:00] came to the church and I thought to
[14:02] myself oh s Simon was you know he
[14:04] brought her there he was thinking oh no
[14:06] there's no way she'll ever be back and
[14:08] when I saw her stand up I thought the
[14:10] same thing no way she'll ever come back
[14:13] but you know what it was there was so
[14:15] much love shown to her while she was
[14:18] there she came back to second service
[14:21] and the second service

[24:05] eff now listen when it talks about
[24:07] Gathering the people amen we got to
[24:10] understand as I said earlier we're not
[24:14] here to focus ourselves on nobody's
[24:17] flesh but I'm going tell you something
[24:20] nobody no human I'm going tell you what
[24:22] I don't care if you say well I'm alone
[24:24] there is no human that really likes
[24:27] being alone
[24:30] am cuz that ain't God God didn't like
[24:34] being alone what we do is build a system
[24:37] around us and make it that way so we can
[24:40] feel comfortable in
[24:42] it y'all hear what I'm saying it's the
[24:46] truth it's hard for me to be
[24:49] alone I don't like it but there are
[24:53] times I must be
[24:55] alone hear what I'm saying and a lot of
[24:58] times I'm going tell you what the truth
[24:59] of the matter is when you say that all
[25:02] it is that you built your lives around
[25:04] complexes and in your mind you think
[25:07] you're going to either mess up or say
[25:08] something wrong or somebody Ain going to
[25:09] like this and you avoid all of that so
[25:12] you won't be
[25:14] hurt let me say it like this you'll
[25:17] never make heaven without pain in your
[25:21] heart you got to have pain in your heart
[25:25] and guess who's got to bring it to you
[25:26] your brethren
[25:30] amen it's your brethren we are Stones
[25:33] the Bible said s and join together but
[25:36] when God called us to this little
[25:38] assembly we all had our own
[25:40] personalities and everything else guess
[25:42] what God knew what kinds of stones to
[25:44] place in here and guess what these
[25:47] stones have been perfectly placed in
[25:48] here to Rob against one another amen
[25:51] that's the only way you'll ever be
[25:54] perfected
[25:56] amen boy
[25:58] the run you avoid the rubbing
[26:01] together if you avoid that you avoid
[26:04] your Perfection amen y'all hear what I'm
[26:06] saying you can't be perfected you know
[26:09] how that's the Catholic church trying to
[26:10] be a
[26:11] monk they not perfected put them under
[26:14] the pressure Ain no psychology and mind
[26:18] over matter can
[26:20] outstand
[26:24] refres only the Holy Ghost can yes
[26:28] we need each other and we need each
[26:31] other to pull each other out of these
[26:36] situations y am I making
[26:38] sense Gathering the people together
[26:40] Deuteronomy 21 31:12 says gather the
[26:43] people together men and women and
[26:46] children and the strangers that are
[26:48] within the gates that they may hear and
[26:51] that they may learn and fear the lord
[26:54] your God and observe to do all the words
[26:57] of his law and that their children which
[27:00] have not known anything may hear and
[27:03] learn to fear the lord your God as long
[27:06] as you live in the land whether you go
[27:08] over Jordan to possess it see so they
[27:11] had to gather these people together but
[27:13] they just couldn't just be gathered
[27:15] together CU Joel said they had to be
[27:19] Sanctified hello so getting together
[27:22] often times make you know what's in you
[27:26] yes lot of time you don't even know
[27:28] what's in you until you get around
[27:29] somebody
[27:31] else we call it a slip of the
[27:34] lip or your act something is going to
[27:37] cause you to realize you need some more
[27:42] help come there is no way out of it
[27:46] there is no way out of this thing God
[27:49] put us together as a body and brother B
[27:53] said if there's any time that you and I
[27:54] should be culish or click you use the
[27:56] word and amen it's a time like
[27:59] this amen what we do some of us ain't
[28:03] never been to each other's houses don't
[28:05] know each other's phone numbers and if
[28:08] we would call perhaps you almost get
[28:10] offended like what you calling me
[28:14] for I've had reactions like that that's
[28:17] why I can say it see so my point is this
[28:21] and then how can we say that we're the
[28:22] body of Jesus
[28:26] Christ and walk in here and don't feel
[28:33] love no it's the truth and whenever that
[28:37] goes on you know what happen the
[28:39] complexes are getting
[28:41] stronger stronger to the place you come
[28:43] to the place you almost don't even want
[28:45] to come to church cu the devil say soon
[28:47] as you walk in everybody going to
[28:49] look the devil talks like
[28:53] that I'm being just down to earth
[28:55] tonight because people we got to pray
[28:58] prayer is the only thing that's change
[29:00] that's right amen it's the only thing I
[29:03] can preach all night to you light the
[29:05] faith and it'll never change you until
[29:07] you get on your knees and want to be
[29:08] changed that's right it ain't your other
[29:10] fell it ain't your neighbor it ain't no
[29:12] no no it's you you're the enemy you're
[29:14] the problem you solve what God let God
[29:18] solve the things in you and I you be
[29:20] able to reach out to your name that's
[29:22] right see I'm not pointing fingers I'm
[29:25] just telling you all of us are guilty
[29:27] yes yes
[29:29] yes I've had two son-in-laws come in two
[29:32] son-in-laws back slide I wonder how many
[29:34] people have called and check
[29:38] up see it can't be the pastor it can't
[29:41] be the father and that do all the
[29:43] work oh I think about think about a
[29:46] going to do nothing I told Brother I
[29:47] think about what think about a't going
[29:49] to help me because I don't know you
[29:50] thinking about
[29:52] me that makes
[29:55] sense now that's the point not just only
[29:59] those two brothers we had two unsaved
[30:01] sisters why I won't say that they come
[30:02] through and you know have we tried to
[30:04] make connections they they didn't stay
[30:06] you can't just all they W see you don't
[30:08] know
[30:10] that but how would they how would they
[30:12] ever be gathered if the love of God
[30:15] don't reach out to him yes and I
[30:18] guarantee you that's what the devil say
[30:20] if those people care for me why didn't
[30:22] they
[30:24] call calling ain't that Ain that hard
[30:26] with pH we got now you don't even have
[30:29] to B you say s i call
[30:36] some hey my God help us Lord we need
[30:39] some help this is supposed to be the
[30:41] Bride of Jesus
[30:43] Christ right we need some help people
[30:46] you know we can't say oh we arriv we
[30:48] have them as a whole now I'm working you
[30:52] know where you stand with
[30:56] God
[30:59] right the Bible tells us amen according
[31:02] to uh uh because there's a work gather
[31:06] the people together Joel say sanctify
[31:08] the congregation assemble the elders so
[31:11] tonight you can call this a theme
[31:13] sanctify the
[31:14] congregation am because that's what I'm
[31:16] trying to do amen give us a word that
[31:19] God can use to sanctify us of these
[31:22] things that we have been guilty of we
[31:24] don't have any beacons and how many
[31:27] times I mentioned you know sisters when
[31:29] you see uh these younger sisters
[31:31] struggling with their children
[31:33] help God will bless you for
[31:36] that right you're so worried about
[31:39] missing something I don't know why but
[31:41] you so worried about missing something
[31:43] in the word we got it on
[31:45] CV whatever they put back
[31:50] there BL that's the TRU because you know
[31:52] I used to think Lord why do I print out
[31:54] all the stuff in Bible study nobody ask
[31:56] questions nobody come back and say well
[31:58] I didn't understand this or that and the
[31:59] other and then next time I see some of
[32:01] them still laying on the table or in the
[32:03] trash
[32:06] can that's
[32:09] work and how many of y'all take the
[32:12] messages from the
[32:14] services and
[32:17] rest that's how you build
[32:23] up we all
[32:26] give we
[32:29] are Psalms amen is this okay amen I hope
[32:34] so amen because if not we're going to
[32:36] preach it anyhow
[32:38] amen amen but I'm preaching in love I'm
[32:42] trying to be a little put a little humor
[32:44] only just because I want you to know
[32:46] that I I love and this is not just out
[32:49] there it's coming here
[32:51] too it's coming here
[32:53] too all
[32:55] right listen what brother I'm saying I I
[32:58] had to turn the Jo but listen what let's
[33:00] go back to Matthew 66 but thou when thou
[33:03] prayest enter into the closet and when
[33:06] thou has shut the door pray to the
[33:09] Father which is in secret and thy father
[33:12] which see it in secret shall reward be
[33:18] open and that's the key that's one of
[33:21] the main areas I think the enemy I know
[33:24] is fighting Us in pray
[33:27] real sincere prayer I
[33:32] mean right he gets us so busy with all
[33:35] of these distractions and remember none
[33:38] of the stuff that's going to stand
[33:40] that's right the only thing that's going
[33:41] to stand is the word of God Amen the
[33:44] only thing and the only thing that you
[33:46] ever do for Jesus Christ will last only
[33:49] that yes everything else is going to be
[33:51] burn that's
[33:54] right so where's where where are the
[33:56] treasures where are the treasures that
[33:58] we we are to be setting up our Treasures
[34:00] right now it's okay as long as you know
[34:03] you're building up treasure amen you're
[34:05] not out of the scripture the B says set
[34:07] your Treasures in Heaven right build
[34:09] them up in heaven yes and how do you do
[34:12] that by serving God and how do you serve
[34:15] God by serving one another you know what
[34:18] the prophet God said he said eternal
[34:20] life is living for others yes amen not
[34:23] for yourself and that's the problem with
[34:25] most of us we're living for ourselves
[34:28] God didn't call you for that he saw you
[34:30] living for yourself before he called you
[34:32] when he called you he called you to live
[34:34] for him amen is that right those
[34:36] disciples had to drop all that all that
[34:38] stuff they were doing and follow him and
[34:40] that's what he said except you lay down
[34:43] and and pick up your cross lay down your
[34:45] life pick up your cross you can't even
[34:46] be a disciple
[34:50] of the deity of Jesus Christ he said oh
[34:54] Lord if we miss that in life life life
[34:58] has been nothing to us we failed but if
[35:01] we if we find him who's precious in our
[35:05] heart then we found all the purpose of
[35:09] God when you find Jesus Christ you have
[35:13] found all the purpose of God oh how we
[35:16] love him this morning may every
[35:18] Christian this morning see the vision
[35:20] quickly Lord the hour is getting late
[35:23] now and I pray that you'll let them see
[35:26] the vision and take hold of Life today
[35:29] and live forever for we ask it in Jesus
[35:34] name I hope this is okay amen we're
[35:37] endeavoring what I'm doing tonight is
[35:40] endeavoring the Bible says endeavoring
[35:42] to keep the unity of the spirit in the
[35:44] bond of
[35:46] peace and that endeavoring means to
[35:48] exert oneself or to labor Amen to keep
[35:52] the unity we have to labor sometime we
[35:54] have to go beyond what we feel what what
[35:57] we think
[36:00] amen you know God is so merciful to us
[36:03] sometimes I can't tell you how merciful
[36:06] he's been to
[36:24] me of
[36:42] and when we con see his spirit and not a
[36:44] brother or a sister you're growing
[36:47] up you're maturing then
[36:50] amen right come on somebody it's true we
[36:54] don't always see it like that cuz I
[36:56] natural eyes would have lie to
[36:59] us always know that if you seeing
[37:02] something that's not lined up with the
[37:05] word of God your eyes are
[37:08] lying You Ever Had Your Eyes loud loud
[37:11] oh yeah you thought you saw something
[37:13] when you
[37:15] did but your eyes declared you did see
[37:18] it and it wasn't nothing like you
[37:20] thought it
[37:23] was yeah endeavoring to keep the spirit
[37:28] till we come how how come we must come
[37:31] into the unity of the faith and of the
[37:35] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[37:37] perfect
[37:39] man unto the measures of the stature of
[37:41] a fullness of
[37:43] Christ it must be that way if Christ had
[37:47] to sacrifice himself you must sacrifice
[37:51] yourself because the sacrificer is in
[37:53] you amen amen sacrificing is when it's
[37:58] not
[37:59] comfortable you got to go out of your
[38:01] way to get her
[38:04] done and this is not a comfortable way
[38:07] brother God didn't bring us a message
[38:09] through the prophet to make us
[38:13] comfortable matter fact we're living in
[38:15] a time where God had to say fear not my
[38:17] little
[38:18] flock it's a dangerous time it's a
[38:21] horrible time listen I I I got a quote
[38:24] here brother said when heaven When
[38:26] Heaven Was loosed when God loosed all
[38:29] Heaven he said uh Satan loosed all
[38:34] hell all of Satan was loosed in this age
[38:38] when God loosed Heaven
[38:41] amen
[38:42] see he said when all Heaven turned loose
[38:46] all hell turned loose
[38:50] too so we really must wake up and
[38:53] realize we got a lot of kind of demons
[38:56] fighting us and the last thing we need
[38:59] to do is to be wounded or weak yes
[39:04] because the wounded and the weak are the
[39:06] ones that Satan goes
[39:08] after is that right it is a natural
[39:11] thing you take a lion a hyena in Africa
[39:15] what they do they look for the weak one
[39:17] they look for the one that's limping or
[39:20] the one that's lagging kind of behind
[39:23] see what I'm saying not keeping up with
[39:24] the flock that's where the devil go that
[39:27] he goes after that individual come on
[39:29] somebody and that's what he
[39:32] does and we'll see somebody wound we'll
[39:35] see somebody we you know what we do well
[39:37] they get over it we don't say it but our
[39:41] actions if they true seed they'll make
[39:44] it my my let me let me put it this way
[39:47] you right they will make it but here was
[39:50] the perfect seed Jesus Christ himself in
[39:53] the Garden of Eden and said Come Peter
[39:54] James and John I need you to pray with
[39:56] me pray with me 1 hour I need you to
[40:00] pray with me and guess what they failed
[40:03] it surely but God want Brotherhood God
[40:07] want Brothers to have brothers and
[40:08] sisters to have sisters sure he can
[40:11] dispatch an
[40:12] angel or was that his perfect
[40:17] will the Brethren
[40:21] fail to do what they were ordained to do
[40:23] you think Jesus made a mistake when he
[40:25] called them three
[40:28] he said just s on then steep on
[40:31] temptation is going to get you the hour
[40:33] of Temptation has come because you
[40:35] didn't pray with me you sleep on your
[40:39] understanding see and that's the saddest
[40:41] part is because now we're saying pray
[40:44] let's pray let's pray we can't get
[40:46] nobody to
[40:48] pray but like I said you know brother
[40:50] Ram eluded to the fact that the
[40:52] resurrection is going to come early in
[40:54] the morning and we got people who came
[40:56] get
[40:58] early to give God his first
[41:02] tiing
[41:07] amen and then when we do get up out of
[41:09] bed we going to give him at least 3 to
[41:12] five minutes however long it takes to
[41:16] put in your
[41:22] petition this is happening all over the
[41:24] message this not is happening in this
[41:28] church there's not every church I ever
[41:31] been to that was fired
[41:33] up years ago is now
[41:38] in almost
[41:40] to something you know what
[41:45] happen because little
[41:47] Le whenever church is not on
[41:51] one will
[41:55] div House Divided can not
[41:59] stand whe it's your house or my house or
[42:01] God's house y'all hear what I'm saying
[42:05] you cannot
[42:09] stand laboring as a
[42:13] body we should never let a visitor come
[42:16] in here without us cring
[42:21] with making them feel
[42:23] welcome hello amen y what I'm saying I
[42:27] don't care there a man coming here with
[42:28] a dress on and a womaning looking like a
[42:30] man we need to love these
[42:33] people no it's true that might be sound
[42:36] like the extreme but it's so
[42:38] true because when people go that far all
[42:41] it is is that they looking for love
[42:43] basically looking for
[42:45] identity and every one of us are here
[42:47] because we're looking for
[42:49] identity it's only in the word we found
[42:52] our true identity right outside of that
[42:55] you and I would would know not know what
[42:57] we would
[42:58] become because when you searching for
[43:01] who you really are Satan will give you
[43:04] something make you believe a
[43:10] lie he said that we talk about the unity
[43:13] of the spirit I hope I this is okay with
[43:15] you uh you know because people we we got
[43:18] a work to we a all on the
[43:20] pastor you don't have to have a office
[43:23] in the church to do
[43:25] something
[43:27] just that that's nonsense that's that's
[43:29] that's that's when you think about stuff
[43:31] like that that's over there in the
[43:33] organization that you got to be call
[43:35] this and call that in order for you to
[43:37] do
[43:39] something the man that gets the most
[43:41] rewards are those who do the things
[43:43] without somebody noticing
[43:47] It Blow The Trumpet that's all you
[43:52] get working together as a
[43:55] body
[43:58] endeavoring keep the unity of the
[44:02] faith right to all of us be formed not
[44:07] just me not just you all of us
[44:09] laboring even Paul was concerned about I
[44:12] think was the Galatians he said should I
[44:14] you know I feel that I might have to
[44:16] labor with you again until you B
[44:19] laboring we must learn to labor with one
[44:23] another sure none of us are
[44:27] you don't you don't have to be with me
[44:28] long to know I'm faulty in
[44:32] myself I can't times I've got such
[44:36] glitches but that's okay I'm still sound
[44:39] and sane and I know I got the mind of
[44:42] God Amen but my my my thing is this you
[44:45] know in my flesh there are faulty
[44:49] things am I the only
[44:53] one and all of us are on the different
[44:58] signes some of us are more compatible
[45:00] with each other than the
[45:03] others yeah you might not think so but
[45:06] it's true anyhow and you have enough
[45:07] children you'll know that's true
[45:10] too some of your children will be more
[45:12] compatible with you not that you hate
[45:14] the other ones it's that the other ones
[45:16] don't do they just don't connect like
[45:19] they and it's just because they first
[45:21] sign not to
[45:24] phans
[45:27] it's the
[45:28] truth you marry a woman that's not
[45:31] compatible you in
[45:34] trouble Man a woman you Mar you can't
[45:37] just marry anybody because they look
[45:39] good you got to make sure you know what
[45:40] you working
[45:44] with listen that we his for be no more
[45:48] children and you don't don't believe
[45:50] that that's why God went to his own he
[45:54] wanted to find bar
[45:56] he had to find somebody Rebecca had to
[45:59] match up the Isaac's
[46:02] character yeah and Ela knew what Isaac
[46:06] was
[46:07] like so he knew he had to find somebody
[46:10] that would be compatible to not just
[46:13] anybody Lord you pe the one because
[46:16] Rebecca had
[46:19] sisters see so that's how it is here you
[46:22] and I must understand by the grace of
[46:24] God otherwise
[46:26] the devil is got he's the devil is here
[46:28] to do what to toss you to and from yes
[46:32] so make you remain
[46:34] children right listen what he says that
[46:37] we H for be no more
[46:40] children God don't want us to remain
[46:44] children in such a way he wants us to
[46:47] mature into the fullness of a statue of
[46:50] Christ don't be paed to and fro and
[46:53] cared about what every wind of Doctrine
[46:55] by the slight of Men In The Cutting CRA
[46:58] whereby they lie and way to the see
[47:00] speaking the truth and enough do what
[47:03] may grow up into him in all things which
[47:05] is the and correction it it it it always
[47:10] will hurt your
[47:14] flesh especially if you're not
[47:18] dead right nobody really likes to be
[47:21] corrected in that sense but because your
[47:24] soul says amen
[47:26] because your soul says yes this is what
[47:29] I
[47:30] want
[47:32] right this is what you crave you work
[47:35] with the inner man yes amen cuz the
[47:37] fleshly man hates the word of God it's
[47:41] eny it hates it it's the enemy but the
[47:44] soul man say bring it on Lord though you
[47:47] slay me yet I'll Trust You hey come on
[47:51] somebody oh the truth I'm trying not to
[47:54] preach from whom the whole body fit
[47:58] jointly together
[48:00] compacted by that which every joint
[48:03] Supply compact
[48:07] it prion into
[48:10] it where so joined together it supplies
[48:14] each other's
[48:16] needs now what makes me feel good about
[48:18] this brother I had seen him in a long
[48:20] time but God let him call me I'm like oh
[48:23] God I said if it ain't there I'm looking
[48:25] for it to come
[48:27] you see because if God had him to call
[48:30] me to help he didn't ask but I do have a
[48:34] sister I'm going to take this same
[48:35] letter and I'm take these same pictures
[48:38] and I'm going to send them right to some
[48:39] brothers that I
[48:44] know because we're a
[48:46] body we can help the people over there
[48:48] cross Seas we can surely have the ones
[48:50] in America
[48:53] am but that's how it's supposed to be
[48:57] you
[48:59] know it's the truth it's the
[49:02] truth people will be in need and they
[49:04] won't let you
[49:05] know and it's all about
[49:09] Pride I'm going tell you something right
[49:11] now there a boy will never get
[49:13] hungry and I know you got food in your
[49:16] free
[49:17] bread let you know right now Pride ain't
[49:20] never fed no it ain't going to feed you
[49:24] either
[49:27] no I'm telling you that right right off
[49:29] the bat there's no way I'm going to go
[49:32] hungry and knowing you got food extra
[49:37] amen I will call
[49:42] you I'm just telling you the
[49:44] truth I ain't going to stand out on no
[49:46] Corner man with no cup and I know my
[49:48] brothers and sisters got something no no
[49:51] it ain't going to happen I'm just
[49:53] telling you how I am but that's the way
[49:54] the prde should should
[49:57] be none of us should go
[50:01] lacking none of
[50:04] us and if a person don't have it just
[50:06] don't say the Lord told me to come and
[50:11] you know because if the Lord didn't tell
[50:13] you and the brother ain't got it then
[50:16] you just made a lie somewhere y'all hear
[50:18] what I'm saying you know maybe the Lord
[50:20] did but just my point is you go to and
[50:22] you say listen I I have me I have need
[50:26] or come to the church and if we can't
[50:28] get it we can find somebody else who
[50:29] who's got it that's how we supposed to
[50:34] work that is the absolute truth on how
[50:37] we supposed to
[50:39] work now I'm taking more time than I
[50:41] thought I would but I'm coming to a
[50:44] place where you could understand
[50:46] division the power of division it's it's
[50:49] you got to recognize what Satan can do
[50:52] in
[50:54] division and whever there's Discord you
[50:57] know the Bible say there's every evil
[50:58] work right so you got to understand this
[51:02] Satan is so powerful he divided
[51:08] Heaven he divided the
[51:10] Angels he produced a lie that divided
[51:15] them what can he do to us without the
[51:18] Holy
[51:19] Ghost not what he's doing it and we're
[51:23] sitting back let it happen
[51:26] see the devil can't take your Revival
[51:28] you got to give it
[51:30] away I'm going to take back what the
[51:32] devil stole he didn't steal it he
[51:34] knocked on your door and you say here
[51:36] you can have
[51:38] it that's what we've done he didn't
[51:40] steal it you gave it to him you didn't
[51:44] fight for it did you if you didn't fight
[51:47] for it you let him take
[51:54] it first Corinthians 12:25 said there
[51:56] should be no schisms in the body but
[51:59] that the members should have the same
[52:01] care one for another that means no
[52:08] divisions is that the
[52:10] word right there's no space for
[52:14] jealousy and it goes on and says whether
[52:17] one member suffer or all all the MERS
[52:20] suffer with
[52:22] it or one M be honored all the m Rejoice
[52:26] with it that's when somebody sick like
[52:28] some of the children somebody everybody
[52:31] ought to
[52:34] care everybody ought to go in prayer
[52:36] everybody ought to feel it somebody get
[52:39] something great all of us ought to
[52:46] Rejoice my brother sh said the other day
[52:49] which was so good what all need we need
[52:51] to do for
[52:53] brother it put out brother kind don't
[52:55] want us to put his thing there brother
[52:58] but that's that's their space
[53:01] now but what what about could say that
[53:03] was ridiculous no he said it I thought
[53:06] it was a good idea right was it a good
[53:09] idea absolutely should have been
[53:11] something thought of before but
[53:13] something inspired him to say
[53:15] it and I know it was
[53:21] God you
[53:23] see we still might put his name
[53:27] we love
[53:28] brother and I
[53:30] think sister we we call them uh the con
[53:38] family is actually St you know
[53:42] me amen you love the Lord amen but our
[53:47] house divided the kingdom div body can't
[53:49] stand and we got to stop praying Lord
[53:53] unify this church
[53:56] whatever whatever and we can't be afraid
[53:58] to approach somebody and say he can I
[54:01] talk with
[54:03] you is that
[54:05] okay because sometime we offend each
[54:08] other and don't know it have you been
[54:10] guilty I
[54:12] have especially in Lim you know there's
[54:15] a situation that you know my heart is
[54:18] still broken before because I could see
[54:20] the evidence that was mounted up against
[54:22] me but while I was doing what I was
[54:25] doing evil was not in my
[54:28] heart but to the brother it appeared to
[54:32] have been evil you see what I'm saying
[54:34] so Satan can do some crafty things
[54:37] that's why the Bible said Be watchful
[54:39] unto
[54:41] prayer because you can do things against
[54:43] our individual without even knowing that
[54:46] you doing it mean no harm but to them is
[54:49] almost like a
[54:51] death that's the way it was there in
[54:56] Li and his brother and his family
[54:58] haven't recovered yet and I tried my
[55:01] best make things
[55:03] right it's a lot
[55:09] deep but you know it is what it is
[55:12] right whe one M suffer all the MERS
[55:17] suffer with
[55:19] it we supposed to take care of one
[55:22] another you know the Bible ain't making
[55:24] us everything that we can have in common
[55:27] but there ought to be enough holy ghost
[55:28] in us that we should try our best to
[55:30] make
[55:37] it that's okay God God knows how to
[55:40] change our
[55:41] hearts I felt
[55:43] something
[55:47] now right now ye are the body of Christ
[55:51] and members in
[55:53] particular right right so let me let me
[55:56] move on I'm going to move a little
[55:57] faster we need each other is that right
[55:59] 1 Corinthians 12:21 says and I can notot
[56:03] say unto the hand I have no need of thee
[56:05] nor again the head to the feet I have no
[56:07] need of you name much more those members
[56:10] of the body which seem to be more feeble
[56:12] are NE necessity
[56:15] amen huh amen those who are feble they
[56:18] need it and those members of the body
[56:20] which we think to be less honorable upon
[56:24] these we restore more abundant on
[56:27] Amen and our Cal uncoming Parts have
[56:31] more abundant caless oh my God for our
[56:35] Comm Parts have no need but God have
[56:37] tempered the body together having given
[56:40] more abundant honor to that part which
[56:44] lack so the honor goes to the fell that
[56:47] lack
[56:49] more so my my point is is we we got to
[56:53] let this mind be us we got to fight for
[56:58] this you know what I mean we got to
[57:00] fight for it and the thing about it is
[57:03] you if you don't fight you're going to
[57:04] lose you going to take you know if
[57:06] anybody ever seen brother Chey that
[57:08] little movie is a Christian movie about
[57:10] uh this man who used to be a what they
[57:13] call a uh Circ Rider preacher and he was
[57:17] just his time was just prior to brother
[57:19] Brad's coming time and he was a circuit
[57:22] Rider preacher he would go through the
[57:24] Miracles and signs and wonders is a
[57:26] known thing in North Carolina followed
[57:28] him and I mean great Miracles all kinds
[57:31] of things happened and you know but but
[57:33] he was one of those ones who had these
[57:35] great uh kid meetings and at the end of
[57:38] the the movie at the end of the thing
[57:39] this is based on the trueth story at the
[57:41] end of the thing uh uh these young boys
[57:45] set this uh the the the tent uh on fire
[57:49] campground on fire and everything was
[57:52] lost and destroyed and of course brother
[57:54] SE was so old he can redo it again and
[57:56] in the process of all of that word about
[58:00] the fire his wife has a heart attack and
[58:02] die he loses his vision and he loses his
[58:07] wife in the whole thing and you find out
[58:11] this young man now confessing to him
[58:13] that he's the one who did it and he said
[58:16] this young man said to brother Jeffy I
[58:18] am so sorry that we CA you to uh L and
[58:26] the campground was destroyed and from
[58:28] that point on they never had another
[58:30] meeting and you know what he said he no
[58:34] son he said it wasn't that you destroyed
[58:38] this Campground and you destroyed to me
[58:41] him he said
[58:43] Satan didn't take it away from the
[58:45] people he said the people gave
[58:49] it see they gave the Revival up they
[58:52] gave it to him because they wanted the
[58:54] Better Way the easier way they gave it
[58:57] to him and that's what I find out that
[58:59] even in the message even in this this
[59:01] church we give it to him because we
[59:03] don't want to labor you know our flesh
[59:06] don't want to really pray and and seek
[59:09] God like it off to we we don't have time
[59:11] for that so we give it to the devil we
[59:14] give it up and then we blame God why
[59:16] don't I why isn't that it's not
[59:18] [Music]
[59:20] there you got to put your time in amen
[59:24] you don't have to die the CLA you didn't
[59:26] have to go to C the work has been done
[59:28] what's wrong with knocking on the
[59:30] Master's door
[59:33] amen what's wrong with
[59:36] that don't take a whole lot of energy to
[59:38] knock on the door and you keep knocking
[59:41] knocking knocking to the
[59:44] open I'm talkinging the Holy Ghost now
[59:46] when the Holy Ghost com it's got to
[59:47] bring a change in you
[59:50] am is that
[59:52] okay doesn't matter use that in in the
[59:55] in the message uh raing Jar's daughter
[59:58] I'm trying to I'm trying to CL he talks
[1:00:00] about goer wood he said go wooden was a
[1:00:04] real light wood oil and and when when
[1:00:07] when it was dried out was really really
[1:00:09] light almost good for
[1:00:11] nothing he said but there was a pine
[1:00:13] tree that you know a evergreen tree that
[1:00:17] that Noah had to go and he had to get
[1:00:19] the sack out of that evergreen tree and
[1:00:22] he call it rise and a Ros and Rose and
[1:00:25] he had to boil it he boil that oil he
[1:00:27] said that was the Holy Ghost he said he
[1:00:29] boiled that uh that sap that sap and he
[1:00:33] B that sa amen until that sap got to a
[1:00:36] condition where he could he could
[1:00:38] actually seal the goer wood he said not
[1:00:42] he said when a when a true Christian is
[1:00:44] like that go for wood he he pour that
[1:00:47] old non that sa out of him that's not
[1:00:50] even necessary it was of no value he
[1:00:52] pours that out of him so so that that
[1:00:55] that Evergreen that boiling Holy Ghost
[1:00:59] sack amen of that evergreen tree can
[1:01:02] feel all those holes in your life and he
[1:01:05] says when that FS the holes in your life
[1:01:08] he said that that that same we go for
[1:01:11] wood amen was like Ste when it was all
[1:01:14] over and it was able to withstand the
[1:01:18] Judgment see see what I'm saying yeah we
[1:01:22] might be go but we need that
[1:01:25] we need that boing sack we need the Holy
[1:01:28] Ghost to seal every hole amen and make
[1:01:31] us like steal in that sense that we'll
[1:01:34] be able to withand this judgment that's
[1:01:35] coming we we working with real demons
[1:01:38] feet folks this is don't this is don't
[1:01:40] be me this is no joke now let me move on
[1:01:43] I'm almost I'm almost done where I need
[1:01:44] to be
[1:01:46] anyway right so we we we come at a
[1:01:50] place and you and I must understand
[1:01:52] because all it takes is Satan amen just
[1:01:55] to throw in just a little wedge just a
[1:01:57] little wedge John 9:16 therefore said
[1:02:01] the Pharisees this man is not of God
[1:02:03] because he keepeth not the sabath day
[1:02:05] others said how can a man that is a
[1:02:07] sinner do such Miracles and there was a
[1:02:10] division among you see how easy that is
[1:02:13] one said well he doesn't keep the
[1:02:14] Sabbath day the other one said well it's
[1:02:16] got to be of God because and no man and
[1:02:19] the Bible said at that point
[1:02:22] sat see what I'm saying how easy it is
[1:02:25] one little thought one little thought
[1:02:29] and then one man over here might worship
[1:02:31] brother the other one might think well
[1:02:33] you know we don't worship brother BR we
[1:02:34] worship Jesus
[1:02:36] Christ right well the brother over here
[1:02:38] might not even know he's worshiping
[1:02:40] brother amen
[1:02:44] amen sometimes people don't know what
[1:02:46] worship is so they may not know that but
[1:02:48] we assume they know it and immediately
[1:02:51] it becomes a
[1:02:52] division how you going going to know it
[1:02:54] until you really hear it from that
[1:02:56] person's
[1:02:59] mouth am y'all hear what I'm saying but
[1:03:02] those little things that will cause I
[1:03:04] use that maybe that wasn't a good
[1:03:06] scenario but I use that because I want
[1:03:08] you to
[1:03:09] understand I told yall the other
[1:03:12] day you know when when it comes to this
[1:03:14] church I I don't we don't have deacons
[1:03:16] and may the Lord raise up something but
[1:03:18] my point is you know when when people
[1:03:21] come in here walking this hardly
[1:03:23] especially those who
[1:03:25] somebody ought to tell
[1:03:26] them but tell them in love now if you
[1:03:29] ain't got no love and compassion don't
[1:03:31] say nothing you going to go in there
[1:03:33] like a drill side and forget tell me
[1:03:36] about it then I tell
[1:03:38] it but we helpers of one another and
[1:03:41] things that you may see I don't
[1:03:43] see y'all hear what I'm
[1:03:47] saying I don't know what time it is and
[1:03:49] I don't want to drag it out because we
[1:03:51] going to we're going to minister
[1:03:52] somewhat on this on Sunday as well if
[1:03:54] the Lord's willing but it doesn't take
[1:03:57] much to listen he said Mark 3:24 if the
[1:04:01] kingdom be divided against itself that
[1:04:03] Kingdom cannot stand 25 if a house be
[1:04:07] divided against itself that house cannot
[1:04:10] stand so if your house is
[1:04:13] divided then more than likely the church
[1:04:16] will be
[1:04:20] too am we making
[1:04:22] sense because amen by the grace of God
[1:04:25] and don't get me wrong I'm
[1:04:27] talking y'all understand what this
[1:04:30] Vision I'm talking about I'm not talking
[1:04:31] about saving un anything like that I'm
[1:04:33] talking about when we all supposed to be
[1:04:35] Christians yall know how we come in that
[1:04:37] door sometime we come in here so angry
[1:04:40] and frustrated and God has a right to
[1:04:42] slay all of
[1:04:45] us how many times you had a good day
[1:04:47] until it's time to go to
[1:04:50] church please don't quickly raise your
[1:04:53] hand true your dick can go well all day
[1:04:56] and then just PR the church something
[1:04:58] springs up in the family why do you
[1:05:01] think that
[1:05:02] happen why do you think that
[1:05:05] happen is because the devil know if he
[1:05:07] can get you divided your division will
[1:05:09] affect the
[1:05:10] service and then there times well that's
[1:05:13] going to affect the Serv I don't need to
[1:05:14] come you need to come and make it right
[1:05:16] before you get
[1:05:17] here that's like going to bed man with
[1:05:20] an all on you what if you
[1:05:22] die think about that the B say get that
[1:05:26] thing straight before you go to bed
[1:05:28] don't fall asleep with it and we'll fall
[1:05:31] asleep and say well I'll wait till
[1:05:33] tomorrow you right out of the word when
[1:05:34] you do
[1:05:39] that Satan can get you just that quick
[1:05:43] thank God for his grace and his Mercy
[1:05:45] amen if Satan rise up against himself he
[1:05:49] and be divided he cannot stand but
[1:05:52] haveen in and you know that's how come
[1:05:54] sat ends up the way he does because he's
[1:05:56] divided among
[1:05:58] himself Kingdom against Kingdom Wars
[1:06:01] against Wars princes against princes and
[1:06:03] here God Amen kingdom is fighting and
[1:06:05] the Bible says amen what what galatian
[1:06:08] said what who do be with you that I hear
[1:06:11] that you got Wars among each
[1:06:13] other Wars comes from the
[1:06:16] Devil he's the one that produce the
[1:06:18] first one should never be a war in the
[1:06:22] church hello
[1:06:25] it's true anyhow that's what calls his
[1:06:27] church fit when Wars start happening is
[1:06:31] that right but he know their thought
[1:06:34] said unto them every Kingdom itself is
[1:06:37] brought to Desolation and the house
[1:06:40] divided against the house
[1:06:42] fall so that's just the way it is the
[1:06:44] word is Right amen you know and we must
[1:06:47] Realize by the great God help us one
[1:06:49] another yes no great ones Among Us is
[1:06:52] that right but the question of according
[1:06:54] to 1 Corinthians 1:3 before I stop I'm
[1:06:57] going to stop here he asked the
[1:07:01] question is Christ
[1:07:07] divided is Christ
[1:07:10] divided I'm try to find that quote
[1:07:12] brother say many
[1:07:18] people you been
[1:07:20] distracted you're letting Satan do
[1:07:25] got to keep your
[1:07:31] mind don't he slay me that I'm trust
[1:07:35] don't figure you don't have to figure
[1:07:37] nothing out the b said cast all your
[1:07:38] cares upon him so he cares amen and he
[1:07:42] would then direct you is that right he
[1:07:44] will direct you if you trust him the
[1:07:47] problem is we always trying to figure it
[1:07:49] out and work it out ourselves but Jesus
[1:07:51] already worked it out is that all right
[1:08:01] amen this is the
[1:08:06] last God keeps his
[1:08:08] word he said and you notice they went
[1:08:10] and got another man by the name of Kora
[1:08:13] and Kora got all the people together as
[1:08:15] many as he could and pulled them off
[1:08:17] separated them from the rest of them and
[1:08:19] started himself a little denomination of
[1:08:21] his own saying there's more prophets
[1:08:25] besides Moses there's more holy men we
[1:08:28] are all holy men and each one of us has
[1:08:31] just as much right to believe this as
[1:08:33] they have to believe that but brother it
[1:08:36] was a lie to begin with God has a
[1:08:40] program and that program is written in
[1:08:42] his word his word said we should be one
[1:08:45] all together not a divided Division and
[1:08:48] fusses and stews but we should be one
[1:08:51] Christ prayed that we would be one
[1:08:54] and and he said this will all men know
[1:08:57] that you are my disciples when you have
[1:09:00] loved one for
[1:09:03] another how can gifts and signs work in
[1:09:06] a church how can God perfect this church
[1:09:09] when there is so much division Among
[1:09:12] Us how can when one say this and one say
[1:09:16] that and one saying something else and
[1:09:18] all contrary to one another there is one
[1:09:21] supreme judge that's God's eternal
[1:09:23] Everlasting word and God keeps his
[1:09:27] word you know what I told that brother
[1:09:29] something he told that listen I always
[1:09:31] tell that only way you can ever say that
[1:09:35] over somebody's never told something
[1:09:37] yourself that you told not to
[1:09:41] say otherwise you just as guilty as a
[1:09:44] brother so quickly quick so quicker we
[1:09:47] can line up with the word better off
[1:09:50] we'll be God keeps his word now if you
[1:09:53] notice
[1:09:54] what causes this trouble there was a
[1:09:57] mixed multitude went up with them the
[1:09:59] supernatural had been done down in Egypt
[1:10:02] and when the supernatural had been done
[1:10:04] everybody flocked to it and it caused a
[1:10:06] mixed multitude to go up with them
[1:10:09] unregenerated unconverted Hearts going
[1:10:12] up trying to impersonate the real
[1:10:14] believer and it's then that in that days
[1:10:17] of Noah it was in the days of Christ it
[1:10:20] prophesied God's word for do the same
[1:10:22] thing in this day the supernatural has
[1:10:24] been done and there's a mixed multitude
[1:10:27] G up unregenerated Hearts not
[1:10:30] conditioned not keeping God's word but
[1:10:32] impersonating something what happened to
[1:10:34] you Lutheran many years ago at the first
[1:10:37] res Reformation you held the torch light
[1:10:40] of freedom in your hand you were God's
[1:10:43] light what happened to you because you

[1:10:47] by faith and you organize yourself
[1:10:49] around that one scripture and become a
[1:10:52] bunch of isolationist
[1:10:55] and God took the torch light out of your
[1:10:57] hand that's true the just shall live by
[1:11:00] faith by faith but there's more
[1:11:01] scripture the next what happened to you

[1:15:19] joy for no you know we need to let
[1:15:22] people know we're happy with amen and
[1:15:24] that's all I'm saying that's all I'm
[1:15:26] trying to get from the people just like
[1:15:29] the other day when I was here I said I
[1:15:31] ain't trying to act make you worship
[1:15:32] like you black cuz I don't even know how
[1:15:34] to worship

[1:15:46] because I'm born again yes it's a
[1:15:48] Pentecostal experience
[1:15:51] amen amen that's that's all it is but
[1:15:54] it's the world you know the black people
[1:15:57] can do this and the black people can do
[1:15:58] that and that's nonsense white people
[1:16:01] can do it yellow people can do it green

[1:16:08] were all cows give
[1:16:12] milk you
[1:16:14] know
[1:16:17] help y'all know what I mean but my point
[1:16:21] is is that you know this what we I just

[1:16:26] Pentecost I really wish I was there to
[1:16:28] see how all of them
