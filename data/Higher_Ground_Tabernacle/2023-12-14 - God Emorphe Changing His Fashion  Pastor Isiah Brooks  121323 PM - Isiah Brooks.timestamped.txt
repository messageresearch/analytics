[47:20] verses
[47:23] there glad to have her here today
[47:32] the battles are
[47:35] raing God has made Us
[47:38] Victorious
[47:40] Hallelujah and the Bible says the
[47:42] suffering of this
[47:44] world cannot be comp compared to the
[47:47] things in which
[47:49] God for
[47:51] us I believe
[47:54] am Hebrews
[47:56] 7 beginning at the first
[47:59] verse for this
[48:02] mzc king of Salem priest of the most
[48:05] high God who met Abraham returning from
[48:09] the slaughter of the Kings and blessed
[48:22] him to whom also Abraham gave gave a
[48:26] tenth of all first being by
[48:29] interpretation king of righteousness and
[48:32] that also king of Salem which is king of
[48:47] peace without father without mother
[48:51] without descent having neither beginning
[48:53] of days nor end of life
[48:56] but made like unto the Son of God
[48:59] abideth a priest
[49:02] [Music]
[49:14] continually we're just going to stay
[49:16] with that one particular scripture right
[49:18] now let us have a word of prayer dear
[49:22] heavenly father God we thank you for
[49:25] your Gra Grace and your
[49:26] mercy we thank you for the reading of
[49:28] your word hallelujah we thank you for
[49:31] your anointing
[49:33] Lord father we thank you for a sincere
[49:36] prayer Lord you have forgiven us of our
[49:39] sins you have Sanctified us you have
[49:43] anointed us with your Holy Spirit and
[49:46] father we thank you right now for
[49:47] knowing that we're one of yours in spite
[49:51] of our ways in spite of our faults Lord
[49:54] God we have Hallelujah no fear because
[49:58] we have an
[50:00] assurance Hallelujah of who we are where
[50:03] we came from and where we're going bless
[50:07] the service tonight in a special way
[50:11] bless each and every heart break and
[50:13] restore the yolks of the enemy Lord in
[50:16] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[50:19] amen amen you may be
[50:22] seated I'd like to entitle this message
[50:29] God changing his
[50:33] fashion I say that again God
[50:37] IM changing his
[50:41] fashion when we think about
[50:44] fashion of course we think about
[50:46] clothing and
[50:48] styles things of that
[50:50] nature accessories or something you know
[50:54] worn people at a certain time it just
[50:58] seemed to be
[51:00] contagious because everybody want to
[51:03] look like each
[51:05] other where the same
[51:08] stuff but I want you to understand that
[51:11] God was the first to change his
[51:16] fashion but it wasn't uh
[51:20] manmade it was always something God
[51:23] would
[51:24] do now we know by the message of the
[51:28] hour who mzc
[51:31] is and we understand that
[51:35] mzc was the high priest of the most high
[51:39] God understand who he really
[51:42] was MDC was and is
[51:47] God and the
[51:50] revelation of who mzc
[51:53] was was given to Abra
[51:56] Abraham so much so that Abraham gave him
[51:59] a
[52:00] Tain of all that he had hallelujah amen
[52:05] and Abraham called him the king of
[52:09] righteousness also the king of Salem
[52:13] which is the king of
[52:15] Peace because it was after the mighty
[52:19] battle that mzc showed up Hallelujah and
[52:24] We Know by the grace of God that our
[52:28] mzc our Lord Jesus Christ will show
[52:33] up after the battle is
[52:36] over one thing about God God Eternal
[52:41] when we think about who he is our minds
[52:44] can't
[52:46] comprehend the vastness of who he is and
[52:50] God gives us bits and pieces of himself
[52:54] to reveal
[52:56] himself often time we look at the Bible
[53:00] and we think all this is all
[53:03] God and it is but it's not all of
[53:07] God because there are things that we
[53:11] will come to see and know that's not
[53:14] written in the
[53:15] book all Paul could say was is is that
[53:20] eyes have not seen nor ears have
[53:24] heard has in store for
[53:27] us hallelujah and while
[53:30] scientists are trying to find out the
[53:33] answer to
[53:36] Evolution the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[53:39] know how it was
[53:41] evoluted we understand the process of
[53:45] God and we know that it is by the spoken
[53:49] word God created all
[53:52] things Hallelujah and we understand
[53:56] amen that God didn't have to mix
[54:01] anything to produce what he
[54:04] wanted God
[54:06] spoke whatever his thoughts were he
[54:10] placed it in seed
[54:12] form Hallelujah Not
[54:15] seeds as in many one seed in that
[54:20] seed every living thing that belongs to
[54:24] that seed
[54:26] was produced by that seed Hallelujah and
[54:30] God had an
[54:32] order don't you mingle the
[54:35] seed because each seed must bring forth
[54:39] of its
[54:40] kind everything that we see is a shadow
[54:44] and a
[54:45] type or an expression of
[54:49] God hallelujah hallelujah when
[54:53] God began his creation
[54:56] it was not three
[54:58] persons it was one
[55:01] person hallelujah amen understanding we
[55:05] hardly ever
[55:06] think that that that God changed into a
[55:12] person because the Bible said he was a
[55:15] spirit and he is a spirit but when he
[55:18] took that
[55:20] spirit and he formed a
[55:22] person he formed the person
[55:26] that was in the image and likeness of
[55:28] God hallelujah it was a
[55:32] man Hallelujah and and we are the
[55:35] highest order of
[55:38] God understand what I mean by person
[55:41] because before no one could see
[55:43] him Hallelujah he was a spirit but when
[55:47] he changed into a
[55:49] person or he presented himself in a
[55:52] person we now we're able to see him
[55:57] Hallelujah is that right he did not
[56:00] produce three
[56:01] persons he produce one person Hallelujah
[56:05] but in this one person he had three
[56:09] Divine
[56:11] manifestations of himself that he wanted
[56:13] to
[56:15] manifest Hallelujah he was God in
[56:19] creation he was son in
[56:21] Redemption and he's the Holy Ghost
[56:25] church today in other words he changed
[56:28] his
[56:29] fashion Hallelujah he became the god of
[56:32] immor even as a prophet of God he
[56:35] changed his mind or he changed his mask
[56:38] excuse
[56:39] me Hallelujah but to understand God it
[56:43] cannot be learned in school it's not
[56:47] it's not by
[56:48] education God reveals
[56:51] himself Hallelujah God knows how to to
[56:55] hide and God knows how to
[56:57] reveal Hallelujah you can stand right
[57:01] next to a
[57:02] person and God can reveal himself to you
[57:06] and the person that's sitting by you
[57:09] won't be able to see what you
[57:11] see that's how God is God can speak to
[57:16] me and you can you won't be able to hear
[57:19] it is that right when God spoke to
[57:23] Paul
[57:25] on the road to Damascus Hallelujah they
[57:28] said it
[57:30] thundered but Paul heard the voice of
[57:33] God and he said who th Lord hallelujah
[57:38] capital L O R D who are th Elohim
[57:43] Hallelujah and he said I am Jesus it was
[57:47] at that
[57:48] time who studied the Old
[57:51] [Music]
[57:52] Testament God in a person
[57:55] hallelujah amen the first time he had
[57:58] seen the
[58:00] cherubims he had seen the altar he seen
[58:04] the temple all of the gold and the
[58:07] silver but he never understood or never
[58:11] ever had met the God who created all of
[58:15] that he saw God in
[58:18] symbols but when Jesus identified
[58:23] himself as pill of fire as person who
[58:28] led the children of Israel out out of
[58:32] Egypt Hallelujah see Paul was familiar
[58:37] with with the pill of fire so when Paul
[58:40] was converted he didn't go to an
[58:43] intellectual school but the Bible said
[58:45] he went into the Arabian Desert and he
[58:48] stayed there 3 years and all he did was
[58:52] learn about the God he met on the road
[58:56] to
[58:58] Damascus
[59:00] Hallelujah see the entire Bible is
[59:04] God and to understand the
[59:08] Bible it must come by
[59:11] Revelation hallelujah amen we've got a
[59:14] great many doctors of
[59:17] divinity I met a man the other
[59:20] day we were talking about God he was
[59:23] interested in how many degrees I
[59:26] had you know I gave just enough to know
[59:30] that I had a little bit of
[59:32] education but then he he came and he
[59:35] said he had a doctor of
[59:37] this this Theology and that Theology and
[59:41] I and I sat there and I thought but do
[59:46] you know
[59:47] God youve studied about him but do you
[59:52] know
[59:52] him Hallelujah cuz when and as I spoke
[59:56] of the Holy
[59:58] Ghost seemed to go over his head when I
[1:00:02] talk about the miraculous and how God
[1:00:05] heals he couldn't comprehend it see you
[1:00:09] don't even know God until you see him in
[1:00:13] his
[1:00:13] resurrection Hallelujah that's why Paul
[1:00:16] said I don't want to just know him in
[1:00:20] his resurrection only I want to know him
[1:00:23] in the power and demonstration in other
[1:00:26] words I want to see him prove himself to
[1:00:29] be alive y understand me the church is
[1:00:33] not a church if they cannot prove that
[1:00:37] the god they serve is a
[1:00:42] lie Hallelujah and you don't have to be
[1:00:46] educated I'm coming with this in just a
[1:00:49] moment God God kept
[1:00:53] moving and the Greek word
[1:00:58] isor is when one person changes his
[1:01:03] mask God God did a big thing here see on
[1:01:06] the day of Pentecost we we we saw God
[1:01:09] put on a lot of
[1:01:12] mask not just one but he put on a lot
[1:01:16] of is that right why persecuted thou me
[1:01:21] talking about the whole
[1:01:23] church and that whole church was one God
[1:01:28] and his name was
[1:01:30] Jesus y'all hear what I'm
[1:01:32] saying God Amen coming down in a
[1:01:37] different fashion this is why the world
[1:01:41] came where is this Jesus if he is alive
[1:01:45] where is he well you see what they don't
[1:01:49] understand is that he is
[1:01:51] alive Hallelujah but it's not not in
[1:01:54] just one body he is in a many
[1:01:58] body
[1:01:59] Church Hallelujah but he said you'll be
[1:02:02] able to recognize them because these
[1:02:05] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:02:09] my name they shall cast out
[1:02:13] Devils
[1:02:15] hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:02:19] see the same God
[1:02:22] today is the Holy Ghost
[1:02:26] there's only one Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[1:02:29] not three persons in God head but one
[1:02:32] God and three
[1:02:33] manifestations hallelujah it's like me
[1:02:36] being a
[1:02:39] preacher Hallelujah is that right and
[1:02:42] I'm just
[1:02:43] Isaiah you understand me it's not three
[1:02:46] persons three offices of that
[1:02:49] person Hallelujah but I act the same way
[1:02:54] Hallelujah I've got different functions
[1:02:57] as a husband and I have different
[1:03:00] functions as a father and I have
[1:03:03] different functions as a son but I am
[1:03:07] the same one yall hear what I'm saying
[1:03:10] with one
[1:03:11] name Hallelujah my name is one and
[1:03:16] that's the way God
[1:03:18] is so so simple the same God today is
[1:03:22] the Holy Ghost not three persons in the
[1:03:26] godhead but one God and three
[1:03:29] manifestations the mystery of God has
[1:03:31] been covered
[1:03:33] up is now being
[1:03:36] uncovered Hallelujah is that right he
[1:03:40] seek to find talking about God he he
[1:03:42] seeks to find those whove been ordained
[1:03:47] to be his
[1:03:48] body to be his
[1:03:50] bride understand me God seek those
[1:03:55] you say God don't seek well you didn't
[1:03:57] find God God found you Hallelujah and
[1:04:03] the Bible said he seeketh those that are
[1:04:05] lost Hallelujah so we must first
[1:04:09] recognize we were lost but let me say it
[1:04:13] like this if I lost a diamond
[1:04:20] ring and it was covered by
[1:04:23] mud
[1:04:24] if I thought if I was to pick the
[1:04:26] diamond ring up thinking it was just a
[1:04:30] CLA of
[1:04:31] mud and then I began to discover that
[1:04:36] under the mud is a diamond
[1:04:39] ring well the mud never
[1:04:42] changed what it was it was a diamond
[1:04:45] ring before I found it it diamond ring
[1:04:49] when I lost it Hallelujah so you
[1:04:53] understand what I'm saying
[1:04:54] you was a Son of God before God lost you
[1:04:58] you was a Son of God when he found you
[1:05:01] you a Son of God when he save you it
[1:05:04] doesn't matter how much mud you had on
[1:05:06] you Hallelujah it was what you was
[1:05:10] made from the
[1:05:15] beginning Hallelujah so what do you
[1:05:18] saying I don't worry
[1:05:21] anymore about being saved
[1:05:25] or even making a
[1:05:26] Rapture but I do want to please him
[1:05:28] while I'm
[1:05:29] here
[1:05:31] hallelujah you see what I'm saying I
[1:05:34] even heard a Muslim say this if you are
[1:05:39] being taught the
[1:05:41] truth where is the god or where is Jesus
[1:05:45] Christ in you if you say you are a
[1:05:49] Christian then you supposed to be doing
[1:05:51] the things that Jesus did Hallelujah so
[1:05:55] let me say it like this it Ain the word
[1:05:58] that's at
[1:06:00] fault it's not the word that's at fault
[1:06:04] without faith is impossible to please
[1:06:08] God and the problem is with most
[1:06:11] Christians we haven't gone far
[1:06:15] enough there too much of us that's still
[1:06:18] living and you and I must die and
[1:06:21] rock closer we get to God
[1:06:24] the more he will reveal himself to us
[1:06:28] more power we'll see coming through us
[1:06:32] that's the
[1:06:35] truth hallelujah hallelujah is that
[1:06:39] right so the veiling of God today is his
[1:06:42] bride having the same character doing
[1:06:46] the same Works he did when he was in the
[1:06:50] flesh called
[1:06:52] Jesus and you know we'll say amen but
[1:06:54] you know what I'm not
[1:06:56] satisfied maybe you're satisfied but I
[1:06:59] can't be satisfied till I see Jesus
[1:07:02] Christ fully on display in my life
[1:07:06] Hallelujah I recognize one thing about
[1:07:10] me it's too much of
[1:07:13] me there's got to be less of
[1:07:15] me let's put this way it must come to a
[1:07:18] place where there's none of
[1:07:21] me Hallelujah cuz God doesn't
[1:07:26] share Hallelujah and you've heard me say
[1:07:29] this God does not live in a
[1:07:34] duplex only one person lives in this
[1:07:37] house Hallelujah is that right if
[1:07:40] there's someone else living there gu
[1:07:42] what you have double
[1:07:45] Minds Hallelujah and the double minded
[1:07:48] man cannot receive anything from
[1:07:51] God hallelujah
[1:07:55] holds let me let me back up she lives in
[1:07:58] The Invisible world of the
[1:08:03] supernatural she's like Abraham she
[1:08:06] calls those things that be not as though
[1:08:09] they were come on people listen to
[1:08:12] what's being said see even though god
[1:08:15] holds our future and nothing will stop
[1:08:18] his
[1:08:19] program what do you mean I am just as
[1:08:23] important to
[1:08:24] God as RAB
[1:08:27] was and God went all out of his
[1:08:31] way to make sure RAB was
[1:08:36] redeemed Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:08:38] saying God went down to Simon's
[1:08:42] house Hallelujah because he knew a
[1:08:45] prostitute would come down by the name
[1:08:48] of Mary it looked like he went to to
[1:08:51] entertain Simon
[1:08:54] but he
[1:08:55] knew the prostitute was coming and he
[1:08:59] wanted the people of that day those
[1:09:01] religious people he wanted to make
[1:09:05] them what valuable to
[1:09:09] God not your
[1:09:11] religion but a heart that was willing to
[1:09:14] be
[1:09:17] changed hallu she sold all she
[1:09:21] had we always sing about that alabas
[1:09:24] baster box you don't know the
[1:09:27] cost of my
[1:09:30] Alabaster I
[1:09:32] like because it took all that I had I
[1:09:36] had to empty everything
[1:09:39] out in order to give it to
[1:09:42] him Hallelujah see we we we must
[1:09:47] understand god holds our
[1:09:49] future and nothing will stop his program
[1:09:54] hallelujah
[1:09:56] amen nothing will stop God's
[1:09:59] program Hallelujah no matter who Paul
[1:10:03] said who should separate me from the
[1:10:04] love of

[1:10:55] into my
[1:10:58] message Hallelujah coming from the
[1:11:01] message great Shining
[1:11:05] Light the prophet of God says in
[1:11:07] paragraph
[1:11:09] 141 when you
[1:11:11] said Mountain be
[1:11:14] moved it still stands there you say well
[1:11:20] it didn't
[1:11:21] happen oh it did
[1:11:24] happen when you said mountain
[1:11:27] move maybe one little significant grain
[1:11:31] of sand turned
[1:11:34] loose out of the hundreds of billions
[1:11:36] and billions of
[1:11:41] tons one little grain
[1:11:46] moved but it begin to take
[1:11:50] place see that's what it is we look for
[1:11:52] some things and we we we look with these
[1:11:54] natural eyes these natural eyes can't
[1:11:58] declare the
[1:12:00] supernatural natural eyes can only see
[1:12:03] this this this but but the supernatural
[1:12:07] eye look beyond the natural and call
[1:12:11] those things that be not as though they
[1:12:22] were

[1:12:48] go back to the faith
[1:12:51] Foundation Hallelujah When you pray for

[1:23:16] is my beloved Son in I'm well to to
[1:23:21] pleased to dwell in he was dwelling in
[1:23:27] him so how many gods there is then

[1:24:51] right Hallelujah is that all right right
[1:24:54] Hallelujah coming from the message who
[1:24:58] is this
[1:24:59] mzc paragraphs 41 hope this is all right
[1:25:02] with you the Bible says there is one
[1:25:06] God not three I keep saying one because
[1:25:10] I want you to understand you're part of
[1:25:12] that
[1:25:14] one we do it all the time we have we
[1:25:18] have
[1:25:19] communion not not different loaves of
[1:25:22] bread
[1:25:23] the communion is made out of
[1:25:26] one piece of
[1:25:28] bread broken into
[1:25:31] pie like a puzzle
[1:25:34] Hallelujah but those pieces did not have
[1:25:37] the origin or it's only
[1:25:39] origination it bread that was the the
[1:25:42] origin of the pieces y'all hear what I'm
[1:25:45] saying and that's why the Bible say
[1:25:47] we're one body we many but we're one one
[1:25:52] God but
[1:25:54] many you know Paul didn't get a
[1:25:56] different holy ghost in
[1:25:58] Peter didn't get a a different piece of
[1:26:01] the Holy Ghost they all received the
[1:26:03] same Holy Ghost the same kind of
[1:26:07] experience they all
[1:26:09] changed Hallelujah into the image and
[1:26:12] likeness of God so much so they were
[1:26:15] called
[1:26:16] Christians the same Holy Ghost is
[1:26:20] today because the Bible he's the same
[1:26:23] yesterday today and forever but we must
[1:26:26] believe you got to have faith you got to
[1:26:29] believe what you're
[1:26:30] say hallelujah that's right the Bible
[1:26:33] said there is one God not three but
[1:26:38] that's how that they could couldn't you
[1:26:41] you you can't you can't get this this
[1:26:43] straightened out and have God you would
[1:26:47] never sell a je that I tell you that one
[1:26:51] who know better he knows there's only
[1:26:54] one
[1:26:55] God hallelujah let me tell y'all
[1:26:58] something even the Muslim know they're
[1:27:00] one
[1:27:01] God hallelujah you know how they came to
[1:27:04] know by way of Daniel's
[1:27:07] teachings search the history those those
[1:27:11] those
[1:27:12] uh what you call the Stars studies of
[1:27:16] the
[1:27:17] Stars
[1:27:19] astrologers they were under the
[1:27:21] influence of
[1:27:23] Daniel because Daniel was the wisest man
[1:27:26] in
[1:27:27] Babylon Hallelujah because of
[1:27:30] Daniel that they understood the
[1:27:34] Stars one thing about the Muslim they
[1:27:36] know that God dwells in
[1:27:39] fire Hallelujah and we know that God is
[1:27:42] a spirit and he is a consuming
[1:27:46] fire Hallelujah so when they saw the
[1:27:49] star they knew because of the what D you
[1:27:52] see what I'm saying Daniel left a
[1:27:54] reputation in
[1:27:57] Babylon King Nebuchadnezzar say Daniel
[1:28:01] God they may not know the name of God
[1:28:04] but they call him Allah y'all better
[1:28:06] hear what I'm
[1:28:08] saying that same God hallelujah changed
[1:28:12] his
[1:28:14] fashion Hallelujah he changed his
[1:28:17] mask and became Christ Jesus our you
[1:28:22] don't believe
[1:28:23] it John
[1:28:25] 10:30 he said I am the father of one
[1:28:30] Hallelujah now you can believe that or
[1:28:32] not but that's what he
[1:28:35] said Hallelujah
[1:28:37] notice like a
[1:28:39] sculpture he
[1:28:41] hides a mask over
[1:28:44] it that's what God has done to this
[1:28:47] age been he all these things have been
[1:28:51] hid
[1:28:52] and is supposed to be revealed in this
[1:28:55] age now the Bible said they will be
[1:28:58] revealed in this latter
[1:29:00] time like a
[1:29:03] sculpure keeping his his piece of
[1:29:07] work covered over until the time he
[1:29:10] takes the mask off of
[1:29:13] it there it is is that right that's why
[1:29:17] the prophet of God had the preach the
[1:29:20] unveiling of God
[1:29:22] we had he took the veil
[1:29:24] off to show us who was there working in
[1:29:28] this day it wasn't just a prophet he
[1:29:32] himself wasn't
[1:29:34] mzc but the God that was in mzc was in
[1:29:39] him y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:29:42] hallelujah and the
[1:29:44] promises that that that was left to
[1:29:47] Abraham has now been left to his
[1:29:50] seed without fa is impossible to please
[1:29:54] him
[1:29:56] hallelujah hallelujah you can't just oh
[1:29:59] I hope I'm
[1:30:02] Bri fa is when I know I
[1:30:05] am
[1:30:06] hallelu that's what the Bible has
[1:30:09] been it has been a work of God that's
[1:30:12] been coming up it's been hid since the
[1:30:15] foundation of the
[1:30:17] world and Sevenfold
[1:30:20] mystery God promised
[1:30:22] this day at the age of this lean church
[1:30:26] he would take the mask off the whole
[1:30:28] thing and we could see it what a
[1:30:32] glorious thing Hallelujah see the devil
[1:30:35] thought that he had defeated God In The
[1:30:39] Garden of of
[1:30:41] Eden he thought he had stopped the
[1:30:43] reproduction of God
[1:30:47] Byam but he didn't know that in the mind
[1:30:49] of God God had a second Adam coming
[1:30:53] Hallelujah that was not
[1:30:56] Earthly but he came from Glory
[1:30:59] Hallelujah and that second Adam the
[1:31:03] Bible said was a quickening spirit
[1:31:06] Hallelujah and what did he come to do he
[1:31:10] came to produce
[1:31:12] children Hallelujah y'all better
[1:31:14] understand me I'll say it like this this
[1:31:17] oncoming world has to be baptized has to
[1:31:22] be
[1:31:23] Sanctified the fire of God must purify
[1:31:26] it y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:31:29] because that's how he does the believer
[1:31:31] you can't just be justified you can't be
[1:31:34] just Sanctified but the fire of God must
[1:31:37] come down and burn all of the wickedness
[1:31:40] out of
[1:31:41] you
[1:31:43] Hallelujah this oncoming world is only
[1:31:47] for God's children God is going to
[1:31:50] transport them
[1:31:52] what do you mean transport just like he
[1:31:55] did John John was
[1:31:58] translated into the new time into this
[1:32:01] day and John saw this day Hallelujah and
[1:32:05] one of these old days we're going to be
[1:32:09] changeed and we'll be oh God help me
[1:32:12] Jesus what people don't understand the
[1:32:15] Bible said God has a hiding place in the
[1:32:18] name of the Lord there is a hiding
[1:32:22] place let the bombs fall let the
[1:32:25] diseases come let the fire come in God I
[1:32:31] have a hiding place you got a hiding
[1:32:34] place Hallelujah that's what the Bible
[1:32:37] says the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:32:41] tower and the righteous run in and they
[1:32:45] are saved Hallelujah according to Songs
[1:32:48] of Solomon there's a secret place
[1:32:53] there's a secret place where God is
[1:32:56] going to hide us from the Wrath that is
[1:32:59] to come y'all better hear me
[1:33:03] Hallelujah God has a hiding
[1:33:09] place hallelujah
[1:33:12] hallelujah you see Noah had a hiding
[1:33:16] place AR Hallelujah and one time the The
[1:33:21] Hiding Place was the
[1:33:23] blood but now the hiding place is a
[1:33:28] dimension y better hear
[1:33:31] me Paul literally visited there he said
[1:33:36] to tell you the truth I don't know
[1:33:38] whether I was in the body or out of the
[1:33:41] body but the land is over there
[1:33:44] Hallelujah he said I saw things that I
[1:33:47] cannot explain Hallelujah but he was
[1:33:51] wasn't the only one William Bram comes

[1:37:01] something that I had never heard
[1:37:04] before he said death used to be
[1:37:08] imminent he say it's no longer imminent
[1:37:11] since
[1:37:12] Calvary it it ain't going to always
[1:37:15] happen and in this day we going to take
[1:37:19] a Rapture so some of us won't
[1:37:22] die but before Calvary all of us would
[1:37:25] die but now in this day we have a
[1:37:29] promise that we're going to escape death
[1:37:33] we're going to cheat him
[1:37:36] Hallelujah glory to
[1:37:38] God hallelujah and that's what the Bible
[1:37:42] has
[1:37:42] been it has been a work of God that's
[1:37:45] been covered
[1:37:47] up and it's been here since the
[1:37:49] foundation of the world
[1:37:52] and S
[1:37:55] mystery God promised in this day at the
[1:37:58] age of the church age he would take the
[1:38:01] mask off of it the thing and we could
[1:38:05] see it what a glorious thing God and

[1:38:42] down and changed his tent come down and
[1:38:46] live with us become one of us and we
[1:38:50] beheld him
[1:38:51] the Bible said first Timothy
[1:38:55] 3:16 without
[1:38:57] controversy greatest the mystery of
[1:38:59] godliness but God was manifested in the
[1:39:02] flesh handled with with hands God eat
[1:39:05] meat God drink water God slept God cried
[1:39:11] Hallelujah he was one of us
[1:39:15] beautiful in the Bible that was God

[1:39:26] same person Hallelujah God came down and
[1:39:31] become flesh and died the death in

[1:40:30] wrong that's all I'm saying this message
[1:40:34] has made me the happiest man I ever
[1:40:36] been Hallelujah and when I get down and
[1:40:41] when the devil tells me I ain't no
[1:40:43] good put on the table open my bible
[1:40:47] however to me I can get on my knees
[1:40:51] and God speaks to me see that's why I
[1:40:54] know he ain't done yet still talking to

[1:41:44] almost
[1:41:46] done hallelujah put him on
[1:41:49] Amen
[1:41:54] that's why people don't understand how
[1:41:56] important the anointing
[1:41:59] is that
[1:42:02] Destro to walk in that
[1:42:05] anointing hallelu not when we come to
[1:42:07] church every day all day the devil does
[1:42:12] whatever he can keep out of that
[1:42:19] anointing
[1:42:21] that's true you going to love everybody
[1:42:24] you're not going to struggle with people
[1:42:26] when you're in that anointing but when
[1:42:28] you're out of that anointing you into
[1:42:31] yourself and that's where the problems
[1:42:35] come Galatians 3 26-
[1:42:39] 27 are all the children of God by faith
[1:42:42] in Christ
[1:42:46] Jesus for as many of you as been
