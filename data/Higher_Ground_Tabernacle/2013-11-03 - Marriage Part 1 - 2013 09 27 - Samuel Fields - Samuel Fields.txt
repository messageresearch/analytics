this is so important this is so important because if she's got nothing to respond to if she has nothing to respond has nothing to respond to how did you respond in a proper way and she can't respond in a proper way hallu is your duty it's your duty to Pro to produce an atmosphere around you to produce an atmosphere around you that your wife can submit to you that your wife can submit to you and if you don't if you don't and when when she always to subit here and when she's when she to submit when she's trying to submit to you she will fail she will fail because she see she see you out of bed

allow her to space to submit to submit what is submission what is submission it's a willing thing it's a willing thing not legal thing it's not a legal thing it's a legal amen it's a willing thing it's a willing thing and God he knows exactly how you doing and God knows exactly how you are doing and and yes I'm posing a marriage is failed if a husband relies on the LA to keep the wife say it again I personally believe that marriage has failed I I personally believe that marriage will fail if if if if the husband trust the Lord to keep the wife if the husband trust the Lord to keep the wife keep the wife amen and wife trust to keep husband amen sir in the marriage amen and no I can't I didn't understand that you see if you on the Lord to keep your wife if you rely on the Lord to keep your wife or husband faithful faithful faithful there something wrong then there's something wrong you love for you to do you love for her you her love for you should do that and your love for her amen and and this is where people are wrong and that this is where people go wrong marriage TR true the Lord can keep the marriage that's the reason why you're staying together but if that's the reason why you're staying together in love your instead of loving your wife husband or husband in them faithful instead of and staying and staying faithful to them then go best not not each other that's right God will do his best but you are not loving each other properly you want 10 minutes okay the British government did a a survey of divorces the British government did a survey on divorces and found but people back about 25 years what what the they what they found was that people were married for 25 years and they got divorced and then they got divorced and people were married between well people married that long people married that long shouldn't get divorced shouldn't get divorced and so so looked at the situation so they looked at the situation what I found was what they found was that the the the mom and dad the mom and dad the children work together to bring their children up yeah Mom and Dad were together to bring their children up they brought the children up so they brought the children up and and when the children left home when the children left home they had no relationship with each other they had no relationship with each other and so so instead of enjoying retirement together and instead of re enjoying retirement together and enjoying the grand kids and enjoying the grand kids they had no R so so they they wound each other up they had no relationship with each other so they wound each other up we were all faults we all have faults we have problems we all have problems but because they didn't have relationship but because they didn't didn't have a relationship they left they left the marriage the marriage if you do that if you do that if you don't woo your wife if you don't woo your wife what is your wife once she's your wife then it may happen to you it may happen to you because no no one want to be married to a stranger no one wants to be married to a stranger amen up to you men to your wife is it up to men do you to your wife good brother and it's up to you to to keep that relationship you more fresh and it's up to you to keep the the relationship with your wife fresh let last time you took home some flowers when was the last time you took home some flowers for her I remember story was about I remember a story once about my brother about a brother said bunch of flowers who said his who sent his wife a bunch of flowers and two days later he put a new computer in the house and two days later he put a new computer in the house and the wife instantly knew what happened and the wife instantly knew what happened and she resented the

new head amen one Peter 3 verse two you want another boost [Music] yes oh I love the word verse two while they behold your chased conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adoring of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but that it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is the in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise the husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being as together of the grace of life that your prayers be not be hindered amen you see God needs us to live right amen God needs us to live right
