[15:05] amen God is good to us and I I trust by
[15:09] God's grace that we're we're going to
[15:12] minister something for you tonight that
[15:14] would be a real blessing to you
[15:20] so let's stand by God's grace and you
[15:25] know as I don't know whether everybody
[15:28] is seeing this but I was telling brother
[15:32] Troy tonight the thing that they
[15:35] constantly seem to be exploding in my
[15:39] heart and my mind is that man shall not
[15:42] live by bread alone but by every word of
[15:44] God and that's not my message tonight
[15:48] but I do want to touch on that in just a
[15:51] bit but you know it's just amazing
[15:57] because I realized by God's grace that
[15:59] there's only one perfect one and that is
[16:03] Jesus Christ and of course without him
[16:06] we we won't make it but we made it
[16:10] because of his salvation plan what he
[16:13] has already done and I thank God for
[16:17] that so but as we stand let us turn to
[16:19] our to passage of scripture Matthew 1:21
[16:25] which is a scripture that we we know
[16:28] because usually around Christmas time
[16:30] this scripture is read pretty often and
[16:37] then we'll we'll go to Matthew 17 5
[16:43] through 8 so we're going to have you
[16:49] turn to for for passage of scripture
[16:51] Matthew Matthew first Timothy and in
[16:53] Zachariah Matthew 1:21 it reads and she
[17:02] shall bring forth a son and thou shalt
[17:05] call his name Jesus for he shall save
[17:09] his people from their sins the word is
[17:16] never wrong never ever wrong the word is
[17:23] always right Matthew 17 5 through 8
[17:34] means interpretation may be wrong but
[17:37] God that way is wrong Matthew 17 5
[17:44] through 8 while he yet spake behold a
[17:48] bright cloud overshadowed them and
[17:51] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[17:54] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[17:57] well pleased hear ye him and when the
[18:02] disciples heard it they fell on their
[18:04] face
[18:05] and we're so afraid Jesus came and
[18:09] touched them and said arise and be not
[18:12] afraid but when they had lifted up their
[18:16] eyes they saw no man save Jesus only
[18:22] first Timothy 2nd chapter
[18:32] we are such a blessed people huh if you
[18:38] ever think about it you think about the
[18:43] many people who desire to go beyond the
[18:47] last veil which is the Holies of Holies
[18:50] every high priest didn't get that
[18:54] opportunity but there were those who did
[19:00] and because you know even if you were
[19:05] priests you could not be found with any
[19:07] blemishes anything that would reflect
[19:13] something that was imperfect so even the
[19:17] outward appearance of a priest had to
[19:20] appear perfectly and so therefore they
[19:25] were ordered to wash to cleanse
[19:30] themselves they also had to be examined
[19:34] as if they were the lamb and of course
[19:38] if there were some spots something that
[19:40] appeared on them during the time that
[19:43] they were supposed to do a service then
[19:45] of course they weren't able to do it so
[19:49] we ought to thank God for the lamb
[19:52] especially the Lamb of God who was
[19:56] without spot or blemish 1st Timothy 2:5
[20:02] and 6 it reads for there is one God one
[20:06] mediator between God and men the man
[20:10] Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom
[20:15] for all to be testified in due time I
[20:21] love that because the testimony of this
[20:28] man and of this mediator was set for
[20:34] tying to be Zechariah please the ninth
[20:39] chapter will read the 16th through the
[20:44] 17th verse
[20:48] appreciate you all just coming out I
[20:53] know that we're living in the last days
[20:55] and everything is at a confused State
[21:02] brother branham basically said in a
[21:05] message he called it the world is
[21:06] falling apart and and it is and we see
[21:13] that nobody understands why is falling
[21:17] apart but we know that it's falling of a
[21:19] carpod because men rejected the gospel
[21:28] Zechariah 9 16 and the Lord their God
[21:32] shall save them in that day as the flock
[21:37] of his people for those they shall be as
[21:42] the stones of a crown you see you don't
[21:47] put any kind of stones in the crown
[21:49] those crowns are those stones are
[21:52] perfected they shaped they've been cut
[21:59] before placing into the crown lift it up
[22:04] as an ensign upon his land for how great
[22:09] is his goodness
[22:12] and how great is his beauty let us pray
[22:20] father God we come before you and we
[22:22] thank you Lord Jesus for being so good
[22:26] to us
[22:27] you have been better to us than we've
[22:29] been to our sails
[22:31] lord I pray tonight that you bless the
[22:35] service bless the word give us Lord that
[22:40] what we need Lord we appreciate you
[22:44] you're greater than anything we've ever
[22:47] come to know your ways of past finding
[22:51] out and Lord how we love you Father
[22:55] forgive us for any and everything we may
[22:59] Seiler done they would have not been
[23:00] pleasing in the nice sight Lord you be
[23:04] our advocate tonight we will always give
[23:07] you the praise in Jesus Christ's name we
[23:10] pray amen
[23:12] you may be seated when I think about the
[23:19] Bible I think about what God has done
[23:28] the Bible you know we find that in our
[23:32] day people are trying to change the
[23:35] gender of the Bible they want to make it
[23:39] a she but you see God can never be a she
[23:44] in that way because she has not the
[23:50] ability to reproduce it you know it's
[23:53] the only the man who is able to bring
[23:55] forth seed and if you understand god's
[23:59] creation you find out that the earth
[24:02] itself was a she because it was where
[24:07] God planted the seed to reproduce the
[24:13] Bible as we understand represents the
[24:15] man hello in the beginning was the word
[24:20] the Word was with God and the Word was
[24:22] God who was that Jesus but the church
[24:26] represents the woman because that's why
[24:31] Adam could not be deceived but the woman
[24:35] she could be the seed it is not the word
[24:39] that leads people in the error is the
[24:43] woman the church that leads people into
[24:46] error now I'm not preaching against a
[24:49] woman but what I'm trying to tell you is
[24:52] that this Bible represents you and me it
[25:00] represents God and his bride it's male
[25:04] and female y'all hear me because that's
[25:08] the way God started it out he fer
[25:12] first Amen introduced Adam and the Bible
[25:17] tells us that Adam was made in the image
[25:19] and likeness of God it was then after
[25:23] Adam had been made God unveiled if I
[25:28] could say it like that the seventh seal
[25:30] under the sixth because man was created
[25:34] or woman and man was created on the
[25:37] sixth day and we find out that Eve came
[25:41] under that seal when God ripped or did
[25:46] that operation on Adam he unfolded a
[25:49] secret that I believe that even the
[25:52] Angels did not know but God just didn't
[25:57] become a el shadi I
[26:00] he was always el Sharia which is the
[26:03] breast at one it was a hidden thing that
[26:07] that God hid from even his angels until
[26:11] we find April ham toes enough God and
[26:14] now God is using Abraham to unfold his
[26:18] mysteries himself amen throughout the
[26:21] time and ages you and I must understand
[26:24] by God's grace that this book must
[26:28] become you hallelujah because if we can
[26:33] understand this week we know that before
[26:36] God even manifested Eve God told Adam
[26:41] male to be fruitful and multiply and
[26:46] we've said these things before my
[26:49] subject tonight is the man Christ Jesus
[26:52] I think sometimes we just just failed to
[26:56] see who he really is
[26:58] oh I was saying this - hey brother wheel
[27:04] tonight I said think about this there
[27:09] are those who have been great man and
[27:12] called great man I think Josiah was one
[27:15] that God called and named him before he
[27:20] was even born but only a few men get
[27:23] that type of announcements
[27:26] or enter into the world Amen with the
[27:28] name preceding them but when it came to
[27:33] Jesus Mary didn't name him neither did
[27:39] Joseph name him but it was the Holy
[27:43] Ghost who named him and it's so amazing
[27:47] because we would never have known the
[27:51] name of the Holy Ghost if Jesus had not
[27:55] said I come in my father's name so we
[27:59] understand he came in his father's name
[28:02] so his father's name was Jesus as well
[28:05] hallelujah you know I've got another
[28:08] Isaiah and I'm an idea of an Isaiah and
[28:12] I came in my father's name hallelujah so
[28:17] it's an honor to come in your father's
[28:20] name but we find out that when the angel
[28:23] came to Mary and told Mary what she was
[28:27] going to conceive I can't imagine what
[28:32] she must have felt like knowing that
[28:35] this prophecy had been given hundreds of
[28:39] years before and God waited for her time
[28:43] to call her and she had no idea where
[28:47] she was born raised up as a teenage girl
[28:50] not even knowing that she was in the
[28:53] book hallelujah and we find out Amen
[28:57] that here it comes and I can't imagine
[29:00] what she must have felt like and you
[29:02] know I don't think she could perhaps
[29:04] fully grasp even after the angel told
[29:07] her that this thing that being you is of
[29:11] the Holy Ghost and it is the son of God
[29:14] it will be the Christ and it will a man
[29:17] save his people from their sins I could
[29:22] not imagine what she must have felt like
[29:25] it's amazing that she was able to wait
[29:28] to go to see Elizabeth yeah
[29:31] hallelujah with news like that you want
[29:35] to run and tell it you know what I mean
[29:38] even if people don't
[29:40] can't see it you you just want to run
[29:42] and tell it that I'm the one that Isaiah
[29:47] spoke of a virgin shall conceive I'm the
[29:50] one and you know what with that
[29:52] testimony you without the vindication of
[29:55] God God didn't leave her Testament are
[29:58] testifying just empty as soon as she
[30:02] called on the name of Jesus and spoke
[30:04] the word Jesus amen what happened
[30:07] Elizabeth's child John y'all understand
[30:11] me because Jesus was the god of John
[30:16] somebody helped me here and you got to
[30:20] realize Amen that even God had Elizabeth
[30:26] to name John because John wasn't a
[30:30] family name John meet the beloved of God
[30:35] and God amen had to make sure that when
[30:39] that child was born it had to how could
[30:43] I said farm itself into the beloved of
[30:48] God now Jesus himself the Bible said he
[30:53] learned who he was
[30:55] I'm sure he he learned him obedience
[30:58] through his veins he suffered but it was
[31:02] the scripture that identified who he was
[31:06] and somehow the revelation came to him
[31:13] my father is not Joseph and neither is
[31:18] my mother Mary because when they found
[31:22] him wandering there in Jerusalem here he
[31:26] was among the elders of the Pharisees
[31:29] and he was teaching them and marrying
[31:32] Joseph was a little wrong with him in it
[31:35] and they said in other words where have
[31:38] you been don't you know you're my your
[31:41] father and I we've been looking for you
[31:43] and Jesus being the word immediately say
[31:47] a woman don't you know I be about my
[31:52] father's business
[31:53] I don't even know whether he poured it
[31:55] up with a knife but I can almost see the
[31:57] child I did defying his Heavenly Father
[32:00] as his father
[32:02] somebody helped me here see but you
[32:06] gotta understand that God he is just so
[32:09] wise in all that he he he do he knows it
[32:18] the beginning from the ending and he
[32:19] doesn't make a mistake and sometime we
[32:23] can look at the things that he's he's
[32:25] doing we can't even figure it out how
[32:27] can this how can it work but it works
[32:31] and everything that God says works it
[32:38] takes faith to move it and to make it
[32:39] but it'll work it'll never come back to
[32:44] him void
[32:45] why because what we have is God's master
[32:51] plan because you got to realize I will
[32:55] have finite minds we cannot comprehend
[32:59] God you can go to the greatest schools
[33:05] in the world and you'll never be able to
[33:10] be educated the school's theology they
[33:14] can never educate you into God
[33:17] you'll never understand God by education
[33:20] I mean all it brings is a good argument
[33:25] we know that the Pharisees and the
[33:27] Sadducees describes all of them the
[33:29] Greeks and the Hebrews they always
[33:33] argued the Word of God because they
[33:36] tried to comprehend God with their minds
[33:40] hallelujah how can you comprehend such a
[33:43] great thing in such a peanut brain you
[33:47] can't do it that's why God put this
[33:51] thing in such a way that it is revealed
[33:53] I love this because revelation a man is
[33:58] not in the head is in the heart it's
[34:01] something that God designed he designed
[34:04] the heart to be a
[34:06] to receive revelation hello me and a
[34:11] brother we were talking the other day
[34:13] and we were talking about the kingdom of
[34:14] God and he has to be the question what
[34:17] who what is the kingdom of God I say the
[34:19] kingdom of God is the king but of course
[34:23] he had some other thoughts to it but
[34:26] then as I said King I said that's right
[34:28] because even in this place I said you
[34:30] can't have a kingdom without a king
[34:32] it takes a king to make a kingdom and a
[34:36] king is a ruler he is in his Providence
[34:42] in his area he is the only potentate it
[34:47] is whatever he says goes in his kingdom
[34:52] and with us if he says something to do
[34:56] and you don't do it normally there are
[34:59] penalties right
[35:02] oh you sure what do you mean let's take
[35:04] Nebuchadnezzar for an example when he
[35:06] being the king said if you don't bow to
[35:09] the image you will be destroyed and the
[35:13] Bible says that even in the natural they
[35:16] said the words of a king
[35:18] once it's gone out cannot be distracted
[35:22] it can't be taken back right a man even
[35:27] in the days of King as a surah when
[35:30] Esther when when the King had already
[35:32] ordered that all the Jews be killed he
[35:36] himself could not say okay let's take
[35:39] that back but they had to make a way
[35:43] another another word another thing a law
[35:49] that could get around that one law I
[35:52] called that second law the law of grace
[35:55] is that right cause the law that God
[35:59] gave was that the day that you eat of
[36:01] this tree you should surely die but
[36:04] there was another law and we called that
[36:07] law grace and truth and that law grace
[36:11] and truth with Jesus Christ but
[36:15] according to the original law the king
[36:18] made it
[36:20] he told Adam and Eve the day that you
[36:23] eat of this tree you should surely die
[36:26] see Adam was a king but he wasn't the
[36:30] king of kings it was God who was the
[36:33] king of kings somebody helped me here so
[36:37] I want to say this by God's grace you
[36:41] and I must understand that without the
[36:45] man crack that's why the Bible wants to
[36:49] water down the name of Jesus and
[36:53] impulses listen there are Jesus's there
[36:57] many of them you know in every system
[37:01] has a Jesus but listen there's only one
[37:05] and that one can only be revealed to you
[37:10] hello somebody I'm coming that only that
[37:14] one can only be revealed to you and
[37:16] without that revelation you lost is that
[37:21] right
[37:22] Jesus told the Pharisees except you
[37:25] believe that I am he you should likewise
[37:28] die in your sins
[37:31] hey somebody and those people thought
[37:35] they were serving the same God and he
[37:37] was God standing in flesh right among
[37:40] them and they were denying him why
[37:42] because they had an intellectual
[37:44] revelation of who God should be
[37:48] hallelujah and God always reveal himself
[37:52] in simplicity I often one that says Lord
[37:55] here was Abraham in the cool of the day
[37:58] him and Sarah out there in the heat of
[38:01] the day and you know the cool of the day
[38:03] and amen and Here Come three men walking
[38:05] up out of the dusters from somewhere he
[38:09] couldn't tell where they started he
[38:11] didn't know where they came from and I
[38:14] don't think they even ever look like
[38:15] they were tired and worn out from
[38:17] walking in the desert so Abraham knew
[38:20] somethings about these people hallelujah
[38:25] what was it Abraham says one two three
[38:28] and when they got to him Abraham says my
[38:32] lord
[38:34] lor D why did he say my Lords because
[38:40] the revelation came to him these three
[38:43] men represents God himself
[38:46] see that's what people don't understand
[38:48] God is the amorphic he can do what he
[38:52] wants to do hallelujah is that Alright
[38:55] folks don't him understand Amen that
[38:57] that even Jesus oh he call him Christ he
[39:00] was there before the foundation of the
[39:02] world
[39:03] yep that's viable Hebrew says everything
[39:07] that was made everything that was
[39:10] created was created by him and the
[39:14] reason why people can't understand it
[39:16] because they can't understand the
[39:18] pre-existence of Jesus of God you
[39:22] understand me he was the logos from the
[39:27] logos he formed himself a body that the
[39:31] body was created but the god of the
[39:35] creation was in him and the creator
[39:38] nation had to call the creator father
[39:47] because the body was Jesus but the
[39:52] spirit in him was Christ see and that
[39:58] wasn't didn't make him to God it made a
[40:01] one this night you got body soul and
[40:04] spirit you one person and if you lose
[40:08] one part of the other you'll never
[40:11] function the same hello let me sit like
[40:17] this you can't recognize God until God
[40:20] allows you to recognize him God was
[40:26] revealed to you when he's near when he's
[40:30] in you or when he's about you is that
[40:34] right remember now Elijah when he was
[40:39] with uh those men he smoked them blind
[40:46] it was a serious
[40:48] he smoked them flying and he was right
[40:52] in front of him leading them and guiding
[40:56] them everywhere and they could not see
[40:59] who that was they were looking for
[41:01] Elijah and he was the one in there
[41:05] saying I come this way
[41:08] come to that he could have and listen
[41:10] even his servants say should we slay
[41:12] them
[41:13] he says nonsense I'm in control of all
[41:16] these things why should i slay them
[41:19] let's feed him and send him away
[41:21] see what you gotta understand is that
[41:24] God is always in control
[41:28] hallelujah but if you truly want to see
[41:31] God he will show himself to you he will
[41:35] reveal to you who he really is
[41:38] he said what are you saying let me just
[41:41] even go to the birth of Jesus the birth
[41:44] of him
[41:45] right he had was Amen Bethlehem
[41:49] Jerusalem all of these religious people
[41:52] and they didn't even know that the
[41:56] Christ child had been born two and a
[41:59] half years later some wise men came
[42:03] maybe they were Arabs or something like
[42:05] that but these men had been educated
[42:09] about the Star of David that was just
[42:13] appear through the school of Daniel the
[42:18] wise man of Babylon like the Harvard of
[42:22] today and they were expecting the star
[42:27] to appear but we find out that all of
[42:32] the church never knew what was going on
[42:37] but it was a time it was a time of war
[42:42] I'm saying something here it was a time
[42:46] of war and confusion Jerusalem Amen was
[42:51] under the attack of the Romans
[42:54] hallelujah
[42:55] everything was in chaos for the people
[43:00] of God
[43:01] but it was at that time the star
[43:05] appeared hallelujah and in that time
[43:10] everybody didn't see him it was only the
[43:13] humble God first revealed himself Amen
[43:18] to the shepherds those who were looked
[43:22] down upon right that group of people
[43:27] that that that didn't know what was
[43:29] happening but then God did what revealed
[43:33] to the Shepherd's what was happening
[43:36] during that time what about the doctors
[43:39] of divinity what about the describes the
[43:42] Pharisees the Herodians and all those
[43:44] great means in Jerusalem they didn't
[43:47] even know that the Christ child had been
[43:51] born so I'm saying all of these things
[43:54] to say let's update it the world is in
[43:59] chaos the war is being fought right now
[44:04] it is the Christian in its principles
[44:07] even who the world is fighting against
[44:10] oh let me tell you something it's going
[44:13] to come knocking on your door one way or
[44:16] the other but it was during that time
[44:20] God revealed himself hallelujah it was
[44:25] at that time Jesus Christ the man became
[44:29] God the man it's something about it you
[44:40] know we don't understand how election
[44:43] works but we know that God does it he
[44:47] chose you you didn't choose him but it's
[44:52] something how when that season comes
[44:54] when he wants to reveal himself to us he
[44:57] is elect he makes it happen like annan
[45:01] in Zachariah in the temple maybe 60 70
[45:07] 80 years old people but they've been
[45:11] testifying for years that they're going
[45:14] to see the Messiah before they
[45:18] allelujah she is something about things
[45:21] that God makes you do without you
[45:24] realizing what you're doing and I
[45:27] believe that the bride will have an
[45:29] inspiration now I'm going to make a
[45:31] rapture she don't even know why she's
[45:34] saying it
[45:35] she doesn't even know why because in the
[45:38] eyes in her eyes she's not perfect or
[45:41] anything but something on the inside
[45:43] lets her know she's going to make a
[45:45] rapture it's a compulsion like when they
[45:51] were there in the temple I know I'm
[45:53] going to see it here was a blind blind
[45:55] blind but somehow God was gonna reveal
[45:59] to them hallelujah is that right soon as
[46:04] Mary came in there with a little Jesus
[46:06] baby
[46:07] hallelujah some inspiration says keep on
[46:10] walking keep on walking hallelujah
[46:14] himmat can I hold your baby huh come on
[46:18] somebody they may have allowed a lot of
[46:20] boy babies to move by them but this one
[46:23] had a certain Chi
[46:27] this one had a certain sound to it was
[46:33] they picked that baby all of a sudden
[46:35] prophecy came through hallelujah oh my
[46:39] goodness I can die now because I'm now
[46:42] seeing the Christ child my mission is
[46:45] over now because he's here y'all
[46:48] understand me is something about Jesus
[46:52] he doesn't leave his work up and up to
[46:55] amateurs hallelujah he is the quickening
[47:00] spirit he knows how to quicken us like I
[47:03] was telling them brother the other day I
[47:04] say you can hope to be to have faith but
[47:08] faith is not hope faith is a revelation
[47:11] from God it is God that gives you the
[47:14] fellows the faith to be healed it is God
[47:17] that gives you the faith to be delivered
[47:19] it is God who gives you the faith to be
[47:21] saved you don't do that on your own by
[47:25] your own mental capacity it is the grace
[47:29] god that gives you all of this ha
[47:31] because it is he who said he they begun
[47:35] the good working you is faithful to
[47:37] complete it you and I have never been
[47:39] faithful to God hello we're always
[47:46] making mistakes we always make him
[47:49] promises and we break them everyone
[47:52] thank God for the grace of God will help
[47:56] us Jesus that's right why are you why is
[48:00] God like the script says who is man that
[48:02] God is so mindful of him hallelujah and
[48:06] the whole time in our walk with Christ
[48:10] he's trying to reveal to us that he you
[48:13] and I are part of him we just didn't
[48:16] begin right our our life on earth is
[48:21] significant we have a purpose here it
[48:25] may be a small purpose but he designed
[48:28] it he for deigned it and he's going to
[48:30] make sure it come to pass listen I
[48:33] really don't believe that young boy who
[48:35] had those few fishes of loaf few fish is
[48:37] a fish and a few loaves of bread thought
[48:40] that morning I'm going home and I'm gone
[48:42] I'm going to hear this Jesus and I'm a
[48:44] feet five feet feet five thousand three
[48:49] thousand it never entered his mind
[48:51] because he just only had a little
[48:53] substance he did not have a man's meal
[48:57] somebody help me his laws were not like
[49:00] that
[49:02] little something right but God had
[49:07] ordained him huh y'all got to understand
[49:12] this because I want you to understand
[49:14] it's just like the woman when the logic
[49:16] came to that woman and said make me a
[49:19] cake first hallelujah see I always
[49:24] imagined this later it was healthy you
[49:27] know kind of plump no she and her kids
[49:30] were about they were starving hadn't had
[49:33] eaten in a long time they probably
[49:36] looked like holy cause people face all
[49:39] something here come on
[49:41] this was their last meal and they were
[49:43] going to die
[49:44] can you imagine God asking the
[49:48] impossible to the man to the woman you
[49:52] mean to tell me you gonna ask me to bake
[49:55] you a cake first you as if though you
[49:58] can't see that you gotta understand
[50:00] Elijah did not look understand because
[50:04] he had been fed by the Raven you
[50:08] understand me he's standing in a
[50:10] healthier position than the woman in her
[50:13] kid and then he asks you feed me first
[50:19] when how our attitudes would have been
[50:22] but you see God anointed her just like
[50:26] he anointed him something quickened to
[50:30] her this must be a man of God let me go
[50:33] do what he says do and surely she went
[50:36] and she did it and the Bible said the
[50:39] cruse of oil in the meal never ran out
[50:42] you understand me it was God
[50:45] orchestrating these things but why was
[50:48] he doing this sort of you and I can read
[50:51] it and have faith in Him because Jesus
[50:54] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[50:56] forever he's a God that changed not he's
[51:01] a God that changes not and God is more
[51:05] than able God is the Creator he that's
[51:09] what he was trying to show through the
[51:11] proper God he didn't need anything to
[51:14] create Alleluia Jesus himself amen had
[51:19] water he turned into wine he had fish
[51:22] that was already made bread that was
[51:24] already made he multiplied it but in
[51:27] this day Jesus takes another leap
[51:31] hallelujah it wasn't the Prophet the man
[51:34] who did it God used his vessel like he
[51:38] wants to use your vessel he used his
[51:41] vessel to show you I'm the same
[51:43] yesterday today forever in this day when
[51:47] the pressure comes you're not gonna have
[51:49] nothing but that doesn't mean you won't
[51:52] have nothing
[51:53] you have a learner and when I inspire
[51:56] you to say what I say what you need to
[51:59] say you say it say anything and it shall
[52:03] come to pass that's what the third pool
[52:07] is about having nothing and being able
[52:10] to prove to Satan that Kaveri works that
[52:15] the sons of God are now being made
[52:17] manifest
[52:18] you got him under pressure but I want to
[52:20] show you what they are under pressure
[52:23] y'all understand me when Jesus was under
[52:27] pressure when they were trying to crew
[52:29] them when they crucified him whipping
[52:31] him and spit they're doing everything
[52:34] what was he doing he was trying Satan
[52:37] was trying to break the lamb's nature
[52:39] but he doesn't get on the stage this
[52:42] nature was him he is the lamb is that
[52:47] right
[52:48] he proved that when Abraham took Isaac
[52:51] up on the mountain and Isaac was being
[52:54] ready getting ready to slay a date
[52:56] excuse me Abraham was getting ready to
[52:58] say Isaac and God says stay your hands
[53:01] Abraham aah
[53:05] have precipitous prepared myself this
[53:09] meets what we said as a sacrifice that
[53:12] RAM was just a sacrifice but God was
[53:16] saying I
[53:17] I myself have become the RAM in the bush
[53:22] somebody help me here see that's what
[53:25] people don't let me say it like this
[53:26] that's why they had to crown Jesus with
[53:30] the for a crown of thorns
[53:32] he was the ram in the thicket hallelujah
[53:36] that same y'all heard me say this before
[53:39] but even then God was showing he was the
[53:43] same to hole that met Abraham on the
[53:46] mountain and even then that realm on the
[53:55] mountain was being crowned king
[53:58] [Laughter]
[54:00] hallelujah and then the real king who
[54:06] the Bible said he shall save his people
[54:09] from their sins that's why it's so
[54:11] important to pre now because without
[54:13] prayer
[54:14] you figure you missed the inspiration of
[54:17] God God trying to get us to be connected
[54:20] to him so whenever he sends something by
[54:23] way of wiring or by by way of texting or
[54:27] by way of whatever you want to call it
[54:28] you'll be able to catch it
[54:32] hallelujah did you not know God designed
[54:36] us to go back to where we fallen from
[54:39] God intends for us to be found when he
[54:43] come living in the Holies of Holies
[54:48] somebody help me here now listen what
[54:51] I'm trying to tell you is the devil's
[54:53] work is to keep you distracted the
[54:57] devil's work is to keep your mind off of
[54:59] God the devil's work is to keep your
[55:03] mind off the of the intent that God has
[55:06] for you is that right because he heard
[55:08] in the word says I know you're in and it
[55:11] isn't expected in hallelujah my thoughts
[55:15] about you a good thoughts they're not
[55:17] bad I didn't come to save you to lose
[55:19] you your names were putting in the
[55:22] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[55:24] foundation of the world
[55:26] nothing nothing that I have saved can be
[55:30] lost
[55:33] woo any man that's a real Christian
[55:37] who's born-again knows since he was a
[55:41] kid right a little girl either that
[55:45] there was something in you that hungered
[55:47] for God every one of us can say it we
[55:51] can look back and says there was
[55:53] something even when I was a little kid
[55:55] that hunger for God I didn't know him
[55:58] but there was something that I wanted I
[56:01] didn't know where to find and I went
[56:03] from charge to charge from place to
[56:05] place but when I heard his voice said
[56:09] that's what makes this thing so
[56:11] wonderful
[56:13] can listen to the voice on the tape and
[56:15] other people said ah I don't believe
[56:17] what that man say but the ones who are
[56:19] ordained can hear the voice within the
[56:22] voice something soothing about it
[56:25] something that satisfies the taste
[56:29] yeah you can't explain it all you know
[56:33] is that you have arrived I've arrived
[56:35] this what I've been looking for all my
[56:36] life
[56:38] did you know God has something in there
[56:42] that says if a man has a will to do good
[56:46] God has already counted it as being done
[56:49] whoa you may not even accomplish it but
[56:54] you have a will to do it
[56:55] I understand a lot of oh that makes me
[56:59] want to shout just having the wheel to
[57:02] live perfect God counted as being done I
[57:08] must say that again just having the
[57:12] wheel and desire to be perfect God
[57:16] counted as being done
[57:18] oh come on somebody now I'm going to get
[57:22] to the scripture of me
[57:23] one of the brothers we we you know
[57:26] brother Derek yeah y'all know him but we
[57:29] were talking last night so he gave me
[57:31] the script and I didn't know I was going
[57:32] to use it because he he might come and
[57:34] preach the same thing but I'll say but I
[57:37] want you to understand he just threw
[57:39] some things out at us and it was really
[57:41] good and he used he says there is a
[57:44] brother he was just so excited he was
[57:46] literally tearing up and I was catching
[57:49] it but I couldn't tear up it was like it
[57:51] was it was an explosion going off and
[57:53] boom he was just something happening and
[57:57] you know I'm a very emotional person but
[57:59] I thought still waters run deep and it
[58:05] was just it was just it was just great
[58:07] so I hope it happens to you tonight but
[58:10] when I saw this thing the scripture says
[58:13] he said did you not know that in the
[58:15] Bible when he says the law says I'm
[58:17] going to send you a comforter he said
[58:20] that same word comforter is the same
[58:23] word advocate in first John 2
[58:26] marita since my little children these
[58:29] things I write unto you that you see not
[58:33] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[58:38] somebody help me here I'm gonna break it
[58:41] down in just a minute
[58:42] he said whip the father Jesus Christ the
[58:45] righteous hmm let me read that again so
[58:51] you can catch it
[58:52] we have advocate with the father Jesus
[58:55] Christ the righteous
[58:58] now you got to understand if that same
[59:00] word is the same as confident we think
[59:03] oh when the comforter has come that
[59:06] means if I'm feeling bad he gonna Pat me
[59:08] on my back and he gonna rock me and make
[59:10] me feel good that ain't what it is I'm
[59:14] sure that's included but this comforter
[59:18] this advocate Amen is a word and I
[59:22] didn't type it in there
[59:23] but it means a person who speaks all
[59:27] right in support or defense of a person
[59:32] of cause in other words he's your
[59:36] attorney that's why the Bible said that
[59:41] he was tempted in every way in other
[59:44] words everything you've gone through
[59:45] he's gone through it himself and every
[59:50] time you says Oh God forgive me for the
[59:52] sin a lot I didn't mean to what was that
[59:57] man that went up before the Lord I just
[59:59] preached on it last week or two weeks
[1:00:01] ago I'm thinking John Ryan it wasn't
[1:00:02] John the man who who had the dream he
[1:00:05] died and he whipped before the light
[1:00:09] there
[1:00:15] it is Danny something there which I'll
[1:00:18] remember the man who I'm trying to tell
[1:00:19] you about and he said he said that in
[1:00:23] that light he said you couldn't lie he
[1:00:26] said the light was so bright you
[1:00:29] couldn't lie everything that you thought
[1:00:31] was a small became large and the law
[1:00:35] says have you ever stolen he said I
[1:00:38] thought for a moment oh yes Lord
[1:00:41] I'm stolen have you ever lied and he
[1:00:45] realized yeah there been some shady
[1:00:46] deals in my life
[1:00:48] and she said you know there has a
[1:00:51] question when he could only answer yes
[1:00:53] I'm guilty but he said just as he
[1:00:58] thought he was going to hear the voice
[1:01:01] of God saying depart from me you workers
[1:01:05] of iniquity he said from behind me
[1:01:10] I heard the sweetest voice ever
[1:01:14] sweeter than a mother's voice and that
[1:01:19] force is Lord when Danny was on earth he
[1:01:23] stood for me
[1:01:25] young mr. hasni see that was that
[1:01:27] advocate that was that attorney said
[1:01:32] Lord I've watched him he stood for me
[1:01:34] I've seen him even though he didn't have
[1:01:36] that Holy Ghost like he should have had
[1:01:38] it somebody over here he stood for me on
[1:01:42] earth and I'll stand for him now see so
[1:01:50] were you saying that's why the Bible
[1:01:54] says if you confess your sins he is just
[1:01:58] and he will forgive you of your sins he
[1:02:03] will cleanse you from all
[1:02:04] unrighteousness you see Jesus Christ
[1:02:07] what did he do the very judge became the
[1:02:12] attorney he became the jury he became
[1:02:16] everything you are in a case that's been
[1:02:20] thrown out I don't know where you're
[1:02:23] getting it now maybe you don't
[1:02:25] understand
[1:02:26] there is nothing
[1:02:28] against you oh let me say because of
[1:02:33] Jesus Christ there is nothing against
[1:02:36] you that's the only way you'll make a
[1:02:38] rapture because the blood of Jesus
[1:02:41] Christ does in your defense
[1:02:43] oh Jesus help us Lord must I read it he
[1:02:53] said but in this case the judge himself
[1:02:54] becomes our attorney God became man
[1:02:58] there was no attorney could do it we
[1:03:01] couldn't find one Moses in the law the
[1:03:05] prophets nothing could do it so the
[1:03:07] judge became both jury attorney and
[1:03:11] judge himself and took the Justice of
[1:03:15] the law in his own hands and paid the
[1:03:19] price of it you understand me
[1:03:21] that's what cabin was all about paying
[1:03:24] your price all of the stuff you've never
[1:03:28] done has been paying for y'all think
[1:03:33] about it meant like the Bible said Sayla
[1:03:35] meditate only think about it because the

[1:06:57] any other but there's no other name
[1:07:00] among men given under heaven among men
[1:07:03] where we must be saved but the name of
[1:07:06] Jesus Christ hallelujah is that right he
[1:07:11] there was no salvation in Moses Moses
[1:07:14] wasn't the Saviour God was - Savior
[1:07:18] though God was in Moses you understand
[1:07:25] me Noah wasn't a savior because the
[1:07:28] Bible said eight souls were saved in
[1:07:31] that eight Souls would included Noah
[1:07:34] and that ain't souls were saved by God
[1:07:39] somebody help me here oh no man can save
[1:07:44] himself they even made that accusation
[1:07:47] with jesus said if you be the Christ
[1:07:49] come down and save yourself Jesus
[1:07:52] couldn't even save himself he was the
[1:07:55] sacrifice had he saved himself we all
[1:07:58] would have been lost hallelujah he was
[1:08:02] the only perfect one he was the only one
[1:08:05] that had God's blood hallelujah but the
[1:08:09] devil didn't know that because of that
[1:08:12] when God went down in the ground he came
[1:08:14] back up that resurrection declared he
[1:08:18] was gone and to prove that he was still
[1:08:21] God on the day of Pentecost he sit down
[1:08:24] the same Holy Ghost that got him about
[1:08:26] the ground hallelujah and Paul wrote and
[1:08:30] he said if that same spirit being you
[1:08:32] that was in Christ Jesus quicken his
[1:08:35] body he's gonna quicken no more about it
[1:08:38] hallelujah hallelujah and sometimes you
[1:08:46] don't even feel like he's there but
[1:08:48] he'll always be there he said I'll never
[1:08:50] leave you nor will I forsake him
[1:08:53] hallelujah when you in the valley he's
[1:08:55] there when you own the mountain he's
[1:08:57] there through the storms through the
[1:09:00] rain through the fire he's there
[1:09:03] hallelujah
[1:09:06] hey man that's what he told Israel he
[1:09:11] said when the waters come I'll be there
[1:09:13] when the fires come I'll be there
[1:09:16] hallelujah God I'll never forsake you
[1:09:19] y'all hear me oh my oh my I love it
[1:09:24] because that same God even when Stephen
[1:09:28] was being stoned hallelujah
[1:09:31] we would have known it all we was
[1:09:33] thinking myself oh man those stones must
[1:09:35] have heard him boy that must have been a
[1:09:37] rock and here God sent the Prophet says
[1:09:39] no it went like that and anointing
[1:09:42] struck in and while the stones were hit
[1:09:45] hitting him you know
[1:09:47] banging on his body he looked up and he
[1:09:50] says I see God I see Jesus standing on
[1:09:53] the right hand of God you understand he
[1:09:56] was in another dimension somebody help
[1:09:59] me here and God just rocked him to sleep
[1:10:05] because I'm gonna tell you something it
[1:10:07] is so true it is so true I've heard
[1:10:09] people said I did I didn't feel no pain
[1:10:15] why because God was there cushioning
[1:10:18] them mmm I know of a story and this was
[1:10:23] before I heard brother Branham say those
[1:10:24] old Pentecost because in the
[1:10:26] organization that I was in there was a
[1:10:28] man who hated that his wife was
[1:10:30] apostolic Pentecostal y'all understand
[1:10:32] me he went to that church and he started
[1:10:34] shooting shoot new golf was the place
[1:10:36] Lucar South Carolina's where it happened
[1:10:39] and the bullets they would they were in
[1:10:41] the spirit and the bullets just bounced
[1:10:43] off the people they were so in the
[1:10:47] spirit that was that was in they weren't
[1:10:49] an organization at that time but they
[1:10:51] became one you understand me they were
[1:10:54] free they believed God they were in
[1:10:57] their true anointing of God and the
[1:11:01] bullets bounced right off
[1:11:08] oh it's true is true is true it's just
[1:11:11] like you said brothers you are insane
[1:11:12] all I know is that my wife and I was
[1:11:14] coming from Chicago and we would look
[1:11:16] like we've gotten ready to be in a great
[1:11:17] wreck all of a sudden Amen I'm saying
[1:11:21] Jesus she's saying Jesus and next thing
[1:11:23] we know the cars were on the other side
[1:11:24] of us we don't know what happened it
[1:11:27] should have been a pileup and both my
[1:11:33] wife and I just got quiet could we
[1:11:35] didn't know this is some supernatural
[1:11:37] happening right now we should have been
[1:11:39] dead hallelujah but God was on the scene
[1:11:44] yo y'all you mean when God comes on the
[1:11:48] scene the devil have to shut up keep
[1:11:51] quiet and still hallelujah
[1:11:56] hallelujah oh my goodness listen people
[1:12:01] people think I'm crazy but I'm not crazy
[1:12:04] you know they think I'm seeing something
[1:12:06] different but I'm gonna tell you
[1:12:07] something I'm seeing what is right right
[1:12:11] hallelujah somebody said Jesus Christ in
[1:12:14] the form of William Branham hallelujah
[1:12:15] we're gonna baptize in his name after a
[1:12:18] while oh I shouldn't have gone there but
[1:12:20] I did hallelujah there's only one name
[1:12:23] one name that's how it is so if it was
[1:12:31] possible it would deceive the very elect
[1:12:35] but it's not possible hallelujah because
[1:12:41] she's made her connections somebody
[1:12:44] helped me here oh she pulled back the
[1:12:48] veil and she looked behind the veil and
[1:12:51] what did she see god those badges kids
[1:12:55] there wasn't God it was God behind the
[1:12:59] badger skins y'all help me
[1:13:01] nobody was worshiping the badger skins
[1:13:04] it was the Shekinah glory behind the
[1:13:07] binder skin that's what we're talkin
[1:13:10] about
[1:13:11] if you can't see that you'll never see
[1:13:13] the potential that God has in store for
[1:13:15] you that same God wants to come behind
[1:13:19] your veil
[1:13:20] and
[1:13:23] you got to see it because if you keep
[1:13:26] putting it on the Prophet old brother
[1:13:28] I'm did this he did do it whatever God
[1:13:31] God did through him but he always tell
[1:13:34] us listening I didn't do anything it was
[1:13:37] God in me it was him he did it that same
[1:13:41] feel of fire he did it
[1:13:43] I can't discern he discerned I just say
[1:13:46] what he wants me to say what is wrong
[1:13:51] with the people they don't understand it
[1:13:54] wasn't the bruise it wasn't the brazen
[1:13:56] serpent that saved him it was obedient
[1:13:59] to what God said oh and then all of a
[1:14:02] sudden they start worshipping the brazen
[1:14:03] serpent and God got angry with them
[1:14:06] because that same thing that God helped
[1:14:08] heal them with they think it made it and
[1:14:11] I Dow and that's what they do it now
[1:14:16] and they look at me like I'm blaspheming
[1:14:18] the holy ghost I know what's working
[1:14:21] through me you can't you can't blaspheme
[1:14:29] the Holy Ghost when you're preaching his
[1:14:31] truth Paul says listen
[1:14:33] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh don't you come to worship
[1:14:35] me Paul said I didn't say none of y'all
[1:14:38] you're not gonna even baptized in my
[1:14:40] name is that right Paul said my goal he
[1:14:45] said I come to do one thing to know
[1:14:47] Christ in his suffering and the power of
[1:14:52] his resurrection that's what I come
[1:14:54] that's my ambition you understand me now
[1:14:57] what good if it is if John says there
[1:15:01] behold the lamb of God and you stay
[1:15:06] there with John like some did you got to
[1:15:09] move on the bride the bride must move on
[1:15:12] it's not taking anything away from John
[1:15:15] John did was supposed to do he came to
[1:15:18] introduce us to the real Messiah the
[1:15:21] real Jesus because there's so many out
[1:15:24] there he came to into
[1:15:26] use us - the one that says Hebrews 13:8
[1:15:29] Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday
[1:15:31] today and forever that's what he come to
[1:15:34] do now you can stay with John if you
[1:15:36] want to or you can move on with Jesus
[1:15:39] hallelujah because John didn't promise
[1:15:43] you a house he didn't promise you a
[1:15:45] mansion Jesus did hallelujah glory to
[1:15:52] God you now must understand almost I'm
[1:15:55] almost done
[1:15:57] because I want you to realize by God's
[1:15:59] grace this attorney is our high priest
[1:16:02] and the Bible said he could be touched
[1:16:04] by the feelings of our infirmities we
[1:16:06] had no idea the beauty of this thing
[1:16:09] that God did you know I'm saying when he
[1:16:13] took on human flesh he took on human
[1:16:16] flesh to know you to know me to know
[1:16:19] your temptations to know your sorrows
[1:16:22] your pain he wanted to know all about
[1:16:24] you in the flesh because God is a spirit
[1:16:29] hallelujah
[1:16:31] but Jesus who suffered for us he was the
[1:16:35] one tempted the man Jesus he was the one
[1:16:39] that suffered the man Jesus had
[1:16:41] headaches the man Jesus got sick the man
[1:16:45] Jesus got tired hallelujah he got weary
[1:16:49] the man Jesus felt overcrowded sometime
[1:16:52] and he went into the wilderness somebody
[1:16:55] wanted a piece of mine Oh somebody help
[1:16:58] me God saw what you're going through so
[1:17:01] whenever you come up shot he says Lord
[1:17:04] I've been there I've heard that
[1:17:07] confessions and I stand in their stand
[1:17:13] Hey the devil is mad because he don't
[1:17:16] want you to get that revelation he don't
[1:17:18] want you to understand that you are free
[1:17:21] because he whom the son sets free is
[1:17:24] free indeed and the Bible said there is
[1:17:27] no condemnation to those who walk not
[1:17:31] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:17:53] look what the Bible says about Jesus in
[1:17:56] Hebrews it says who in the days of his
[1:17:58] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[1:18:01] supplication with strong crying and
[1:18:03] tears under him that was able to save
[1:18:06] him from death and was her in that he
[1:18:10] feared though he was a son yet learned
[1:18:13] he obedience by the things which he
[1:18:17] suffered see that's why it's so
[1:18:19] important that you get the Holy Ghost
[1:18:21] because it's the Holy Ghost that that
[1:18:23] brings you to perfection because he's
[1:18:26] perfect he's been accepted so he knows
[1:18:29] the same spirit that brought him to that
[1:18:31] perfection is the same spirit that'll
[1:18:33] bring you to the perfection y'all
[1:18:36] understand me and so once you get the
[1:18:38] seal of the Holy Ghost God counted as
[1:18:39] done because God is going to complete
[1:18:43] that work hallelujah oh is that right oh
[1:18:49] my goodness it's just like the shoe you
[1:18:53] know when she was about ready to die she
[1:18:55] wouldn't in she's made up a meal
[1:18:56] offering did you know the meal offer and
[1:18:58] represented Christ and that all
[1:19:00] represented the Holy Spirit is that
[1:19:03] right and we formed that little that
[1:19:05] little fire with the cross there and put
[1:19:07] that fire in the middle in it just
[1:19:08] hallelujah it was a whole Kaveri seen
[1:19:11] done in shadow and tied hallelujah and
[1:19:15] even in that he meant the Bible said
[1:19:18] that they all in the meal meal would not
[1:19:20] run out somebody help me here once you
[1:19:24] get the Holy Ghost you don't have to
[1:19:25] worry about it running out hallelujah
[1:19:28] you'll never have to worry about being
[1:19:30] dried up and dead hallelujah why because
[1:19:34] you're in the presence of the Shekinah
[1:19:36] whoa Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:19:40] ooh we're here to reflect Jesus huh
[1:19:45] we're here to reflect the Lord Jesus
[1:19:46] Christ and you'd have heard me say this
[1:19:49] before all it is is that you and I will
[1:19:52] like Samson I love that message I love
[1:19:54] it oh Lord once more once more Lord you
[1:19:57] know because it was after the seals and
[1:19:59] everything else so it represented the
[1:20:00] bride of Jesus Christ how she would get
[1:20:03] worldly
[1:20:05] well she was already cast out but she
[1:20:08] was gonna get worldly she was gonna be
[1:20:09] distracted she was gonna do exactly what
[1:20:12] Samson did lost his power hallelujah
[1:20:17] but after that that old good dug the
[1:20:20] Philistines and the restaurant start
[1:20:21] kicking her around him around harlot is
[1:20:24] something quick in here so wait a minute
[1:20:27] I got the Holy Ghost has got to be still
[1:20:29] there ha maybe it's not bidding for us
[1:20:33] right now admit but all Lord once more
[1:20:38] help me Jesus revive my soul oh my god
[1:20:45] ie God did just dead he died it may have
[1:20:52] taken a while for him to die but as soon
[1:20:55] as he died he got up you said what do
[1:20:59] you mean because when you die in God you
[1:21:01] don't die five minutes less more or less
[1:21:05] you in the presence of the Lord
[1:21:07] hallelujah and he proved that God he God
[1:21:10] proved he's living because he put him in
[1:21:12] the Hall of Fame he looked like a
[1:21:17] failure but he whipped the devil at the
[1:21:19] end you whip him cuz you are danger whip
[1:21:30] him hallelujah god help us cheese that
[1:21:38] man in Christ Jesus I could preach on
[1:21:39] him all night but I you know I look at
[1:21:43] him as his Lord
[1:21:43] I said listen y'all know it's the truth
[1:21:46] God is never forsaken you many times we
[1:21:50] we know we're not worthy of his presence
[1:21:53] and then when we think oh it's all
[1:21:56] washed up when you think ain't guarding
[1:21:58] it just Here Come God putting a little
[1:22:01] desire in you you know Lord I want to do
[1:22:04] better and we don't even think about
[1:22:06] that desire we think always just ELISA
[1:22:08] but don't you understand without God
[1:22:10] giving it to you you wouldn't have it
[1:22:13] God gave you that desire to get up out
[1:22:16] of the dust and move forward God
[1:22:19] you say ya'll said God does not desire
[1:22:22] Lord make it come make it blue market
[1:22:25] blossom
[1:22:26] make it bring forth fruit bring this
[1:22:31] Jesus in me hallelujah mare don't make
[1:22:35] no difference that we look like a
[1:22:36] fanatic it's alright but I'm gonna keep
[1:22:39] it keep this desire until I see this
[1:22:41] desire become Jesus himself
[1:22:43] woo I'm gonna trust how can you you know
[1:22:47] the thing is if you lose trust in God
[1:22:49] you might as well what there's nothing
[1:22:52] there's nothing in this world
[1:22:55] let's go satisfy you like Jesus nothing
[1:22:59] and you lose I don't care how weak you
[1:23:03] are we know they're weak Christians but
[1:23:06] till a week Christian is greater than
[1:23:07] Satan that's right Satan still don't
[1:23:11] what do we Christian to pray hallelujah
[1:23:14] even it's your weakest point you're
[1:23:17] strong because Jesus in you he's there
[1:23:20] for you he whipped the devil hallelujah
[1:23:24] I love this I love this I love this
[1:23:27] touch not my anointed nor do my prophets
[1:23:31] any harm y'all understand me and you are
[1:23:33] in there right in that scripture touch
[1:23:36] not my anointed my anointed amen that's
[1:23:41] the Word of God is that right he can't
[1:23:43] destroy you because the Word of God said
[1:23:45] it in Revelation do whatever you can do
[1:23:48] but don't touch the oil in the way don't
[1:23:53] touch that Holy Ghost you can do
[1:23:55] whatever but don't you try to break that
[1:23:58] seal Satan can't break it I don't care
[1:24:05] how low you feel and how how alone you
[1:24:07] lonely you feel God got something for
[1:24:10] you you say old brother Brooks what are
[1:24:13] you saying all I'm saying is that we
[1:24:17] need to get back in line because the
[1:24:20] power of the Antichrist is not playing
[1:24:22] y'all hear me the power the Antichrist
[1:24:26] is moving just like Christ is moving
[1:24:28] right they move like this
[1:24:32] Jacob and Esau right they move just like
[1:24:35] this and so you got to realize that that
[1:24:38] that Antichrist is moving to and
[1:24:39] anything that is against Christ it's an
[1:24:43] anti you can't put whoa but we God don't
[1:24:46] do that no more God does exactly what he
[1:24:49] says he's gonna do if he said I'm the
[1:24:50] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:24:52] means God can do it God will do it you
[1:24:55] just need somebody that's gonna believe
[1:24:57] it hallelujah and because you don't see
[1:24:59] it doesn't mean it's not real hmm God
[1:25:04] works miracles hallelujah
[1:25:10] the problem is when situations arise we
[1:25:13] fail to ask God for faith to conquer it
[1:25:16] or conquer them we try to handle our
[1:25:20] situations ourselves hallelujah human
[1:25:23] effort we'll never defeat the devil
[1:25:25] right just like the Lord showed me that
[1:25:28] even when you spank your children if you
[1:25:30] don't pray dumb devil ain't going
[1:25:32] nowhere right they may resist doing
[1:25:37] whatever they doing so they won't get
[1:25:39] spanked again but you believe it's still
[1:25:41] there no rod cast out Devils no rod can
[1:25:47] break a devil spirit y'all understand me
[1:25:50] it is the anointing is that the word the
[1:25:54] Bob said it is the anointing that
[1:25:55] destroys the yoke hallelujah mental
[1:26:00] power does not cast out devils
[1:26:06] hallelujah it is one power that cast out
[1:26:10] devils and that's faith in God and only
[1:26:14] that faith can come back God and you and
[1:26:19] I must realize they men when we need
[1:26:21] help we need to ask God for it's nothing
[1:26:24] wrong with saying god I don't have the
[1:26:26] faith but give me the faith hey when the
[1:26:31] struggle you struggle hallelujah but you
[1:26:33] don't have to struggle says Lord take
[1:26:35] away the struggle give me what I need to
[1:26:38] conquer the devil and some time it is
[1:26:41] just one something small something small
[1:26:43] like a little stone like
[1:26:45] even had to destroy a great giant
[1:26:52] hallelujah you love the Lord listen the
[1:26:55] Bible said don't be shaken in mind
[1:26:57] according to second Thessalonians I'll
[1:27:00] be troubled neither by spirit nor by
[1:27:03] word nor by letter as from us as they as
[1:27:06] that the day of Christ is at hand he
[1:27:08] said don't even be shaken in your mind
[1:27:10] all of the things that come oh lord have
[1:27:13] mercy what I'm gonna do don't fret
[1:27:14] yourself it's coming it's gonna happen
[1:27:19] God is in control is that right listen
[1:27:24] God put you in such a position sometimes
[1:27:27] but he want to see how much faith you
[1:27:28] got right he said listen Paul he said
[1:27:31] when you get on that seat it's going to
[1:27:34] storm and it's gonna your ship is going
[1:27:37] to wreck right he said but whatever you
[1:27:42] do don't get off the ship stay on the
[1:27:45] boat cuz sometimes we think getting off
[1:27:50] the ship getting off the boat it's the
[1:27:52] safe place not when it comes to God if
[1:27:55] God says stand still stand still don't
[1:28:00] move stay right there
[1:28:04] and the Bible said that the ship with
[1:28:07] them break it up and everybody that
[1:28:09] stayed on the ship was saying God got a
[1:28:15] strange way of doing things but when you
[1:28:19] trust him like you say brother when you
[1:28:22] know you've heard from God because I'm
[1:28:24] gonna tell you something when you hear
[1:28:25] from God few old things are getting
[1:28:27] worse Fox is not you just prayed you
[1:28:32] just pray that ain't getting washed it
[1:28:34] looks like that but in the spirit of
[1:28:37] mine is not getting worse he's getting
[1:28:39] better
[1:28:40] God than answer your prayer and the
[1:28:44] devil is kicking up because he knows
[1:28:46] he's got to go but the moment you say is
[1:28:49] getting washed it gets worse but when
[1:28:53] you see it worse you ought to say thank
[1:28:55] God he's getting bad
[1:28:58] that's the truth when the woman's having
[1:29:01] a baby
[1:29:02] it gets worse before it gets better it
[1:29:11] ain't getting worse it's getting better
[1:29:13] I don't trade and that devil just got my
[1:29:15] eyes looking at stuff that's not but
[1:29:18] Abraham called those things that be not
[1:29:19] as though they were he looked me on all
[1:29:22] of that trouble there's no Sun God says
[1:29:25] so God says so oh my god ain't God good
[1:29:35] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:29:39] that day shall not come except there
[1:29:41] come a falling away and people don't
[1:29:44] understand you when you fall away from
[1:29:46] the word you got nothing on your side
[1:29:49] the word is the only thing that can keep
[1:29:51] you and you must understand you got to
[1:29:54] believe all of God's Word not some of it
[1:29:57] because man does not live by bread alone
[1:29:59] but every word that proceeds out of the
[1:30:01] mouth of God
[1:30:02] and when you take God at His Word you
[1:30:04] don't know how he's going to do it I can
[1:30:07] tell you I can ask you a question and
[1:30:09] not one of us can answer it right now I
[1:30:11] can ask you a question and I'm going to
[1:30:14] ask you how does the world spin on his
[1:30:17] axle and wrote Rick rotate around the
[1:30:20] Sun and not drop into darkness what's
[1:30:24] holding it up what's got it turning have
[1:30:27] you seen the motor have you seen the
[1:30:31] belt have you seen anything that that
[1:30:33] makes it happen why is it and I can take
[1:30:37] this tambourine and let it go into a
[1:30:39] drop I can try to spin it in are never
[1:30:41] spending the same orbit or the same spin
[1:30:43] in one place same place at one time yet
[1:30:46] this earth is still spinning in the same
[1:30:50] place that God ordained it to spin and
[1:30:52] it's rotating around and moving the
[1:30:56] stars are still in its place yeah
[1:30:58] somebody help me here now if God can do
[1:31:01] that can he has answered your little
[1:31:03] bitty problem
[1:31:07] listen he probably need us microscope
[1:31:10] just just to find it
[1:31:13] but to us is great you know even the
[1:31:21] mountain ain't number two and here to
[1:31:22] God but to us we look at it you know why
[1:31:27] because God God could have made us giant
[1:31:29] when he made us small so we can believe
[1:31:31] big and I'll say it like this yo God
[1:31:36] ain't no bigger than the faith that you
[1:31:38] have if you got big faith for God he's
[1:31:41] big if your faith is a little he's
[1:31:43] little hallelujah I'm almost done you
[1:31:49] know God is real so I'll say this by
[1:31:53] God's grace keep watch and prayer it's a
[1:31:58] struggle now I know I struggle every day
[1:32:01] anybody know I struggle every day I
[1:32:05] fight Satan and let's put this way
[1:32:08] instead of fighting him I resist him
[1:32:10] every day that's what I do I don't fight
[1:32:12] him because I can but I will resist him
[1:32:15] that's what the Bible said you resist
[1:32:17] the devil he'll flee from you
[1:32:19] and all of us resisting oh come on folks
[1:32:24] you think you're going listen.you in a
[1:32:26] war how many about anybody y'all know
[1:32:29] been ever in a war in Iraq or whatever
[1:32:33] anybody ever said oh I woke up every
[1:32:35] morning with such courage I was ready to
[1:32:40] fight and all you've heard all night was
[1:32:44] bombs and everything screams and hollows
[1:32:47] you know let's get real you was just
[1:32:53] hoping somebody wasn't seeing you
[1:32:54] shaking no you can be in the war and not
[1:32:58] scared and you have to pray God give me
[1:33:02] faith Lord don't let me be a coward
[1:33:07] right don't let me don't let me run a
[1:33:10] war now we look at a Wallace as it's
[1:33:15] really bad because it is but you've got
[1:33:16] to understand I'm sure every man in a
[1:33:19] war faces that kind of a temptation
[1:33:23] getting out of the area where there
[1:33:28] but to be a man you got to stand there
[1:33:30] knowing that at some point in time you
[1:33:33] can become a victim of that war but what
[1:33:36] makes a man stand is because he must
[1:33:39] remember what he's fighting for the
[1:33:43] cause of what he's fighting for
[1:33:45] hallelujah that's what makes him go
[1:33:48] forward and you gotta remember what
[1:33:50] you're fighting for the cause of your
[1:33:53] fight and then what is it you want a new
[1:33:55] wild you want a new life you want to do
[1:33:57] you want to be what God wants you to be
[1:34:00] and I'm gonna fight for him I'm not
[1:34:03] gonna let Satan defeat me in this
[1:34:05] dimension hallelujah
[1:34:08] y'all understand me that's what I love
[1:34:13] about Jesus he was the warrior of all
[1:34:16] times and he defeated death hell and the
[1:34:20] grave for us the greatest of all enemies
[1:34:24] everything else was just foot soldiers
[1:34:28] whatever you want to call it but if God
[1:34:31] conquered the greater man the greater
[1:34:34] demons what about these little things
[1:34:36] that we fighting right like I've heard
[1:34:41] somebody say Israel was looking at how
[1:34:44] great and how big Goliath the giant was
[1:34:50] and David was looking at how big his God
[1:34:53] was and that's what we must keep in our
[1:34:58] hearts and our mind we're not cowards
[1:35:00] matter of fact we've got the strength of
[1:35:03] the Lord in us less than
