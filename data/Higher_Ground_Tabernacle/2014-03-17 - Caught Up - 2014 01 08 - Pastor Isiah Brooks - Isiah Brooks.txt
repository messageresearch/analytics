TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we might as well get ready because if we don't leave it it will leave us the Bible say it's going to pass away amen you love the Lord appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ we're not go prolong the time we're just going to get right into the word of God Amen we're going to be coming from Isaiah 26 amen I've had so many people sharing all and thought I I'll share a few things kind of implemented into my message for tonight we studied this last night and my I just thank God for the Holy Spirit uh because the Holy Spirit no matter where you are you can be in Japan and he'll give you the same message you know and I believe with all of my heart by the grace of God that's how Paul came to know things that he did not would not have known and not he went out in the desert and fellowship and commune with God and then he came out there knowing more than the rest of them you see that's how it is with God and that's how it is in this day he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not amen last night we uh in Bible study we we preached on the secret coming and catching away amen and uh I just believe with all my heart uh you can't be caught up you can't catch up or CAU be caught up until you catch up and there's a lot of people that need to catch up so they can be caught up amen so we thank God for his grace as we read Isaiah 26 and 20 and from there we're going to go to First Corinthians Isaiah 26:20 you love the Lord for whatever reason I want to trans expose these numbers 2620 come my people enter thou into thy Chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the ignoration be overpassed I'm sorry we're going to read one more scripture Joel we're going to throw Joel in there by the grace of God Joel two Joel two I believe God is God is trying to tell us something amen Joel 2:16 let's read 15 blow ye the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a Sol a assembly now you got to realize what that's all about gather the people sanctify the congregation assem the elders gather the children and those that are suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet 1 Corinthians 2 and5 you got to go in before you can come out First Corinthians 2 2 chapter getting at the fifth verse that your faith should stand not or not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of the Holy Ghost how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to n but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes that would princes of this world knew but had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God have prepared for them that love him now watch this but God have revealed them unto us by his Spirit now here Paul picks up the scripture amen I have not seen and ear have not heard amen he picks that up out of Isaiah 64 and4 and then Paul comes along excuse me and Paul comes along and pick up what Isaiah says but then he modifies it or he brings it up to his date and he said but God have revealed them unto us now as have not seen ISS have not heard but Paul said yes it is it is so now right God but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yet the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received here it is now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God let us pray our gracious father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you've done for us father forgive us and cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness let the blood of Jesus Christ Our Father oh God wash away all that we may have said thought are done today Lord not just for the for the people in the audience but from the pull pit to the back of the door let your power Lord God your fire come down and and just Lord do a great work in our hearts Lord change our minds Lord from worldly things to Heavenly things help us Lord God our Father that we would just submit to you Lord in every way Lord God oh God because we believe and know by faith that we are your bride and We Know by the grace of God that every seed of God come to maturity bless us right now here this this evening Lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated Lord's willingen thank God for his gra thank you brother Hallelujah we like to uh just start off by the grace of God uh with a a few uh historical things things that are happening right now uh you know in our life and in our world today we know by the grace of God that we're living in the end time because God has given us description of the things that we ought to look for famine earthquakes pestilence Wars rumors of wars and we all know these things and right now I I was uh text uh several uh textes today uh one came from uh Ohio where uh and they showed us that uh they in Oklahoma amen uh they there's a group of people that want has a a unveiling plan uh to unveil the statue of Satan and they want to put it right there on the state yard amen where the Ten Commandments are yeah yeah you can go look it up and it's amazing because Satan is becoming Bolder and it's the same kind of image that the Illuminati and all of these people worship Hallelujah come on somebody and at the same time we see you know uh overseas and uh that that's being bombarded by storms well look at America look what look what's happening to us I mean and look at our nation it's just a matter of time uh before all this rain and snow and water shake things are loose for us uh you know but yet and still we find that this is a time where you know I was talking with the brother that you know we not only can see the evil but we can also feel it on a daily basis the pressure of it you know the Mind battles that uh we we have has become so uh intense far far far uh beyond what it was a few years ago and so we realize you're going to either live or die sink or swim amen that's it there there there are no middle ground when there is no Purgatory I you know don't want to disappoint you but there is no Purgatory that God is going to send you to you either make heaven or make hell amen and so we find out by the grace of God Amen that this is a time and you know brother brandom said we can live so close to God that God will take us places and that's what I'm pressing and trying to press into that that I can live so with God because remember the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost must must live in you supremely that that that's something folks he said the Holy Ghost must live in you supremely that means he must I'm talking about Rapture material now in order to make this Rapture so let us not fool ourselves the Holy Ghost must live in you supremely now let me put it this way if he doesn't it is not his fault it is only our fault because whosoever will see God will never Force this thing on you but think about it here God and and I love this because I don't want you to panic and say oh my God I'm going to make it because if if you true seed God will make sure you come to maturity now you some of us might have to come the harder way but God is going to do it amen is that all right now we're living in a time and we find out that you know this is one of my favorite chapters and that is Psalms 27 but we find out I'm just going to turn there quickly Psalm 27 I don't want to mess it up psalms 27 everybody all right amen now we find out by the grace of God Amen in Psalm 27 and and one now this is not just David talking but this is the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he's trying to get a message over to the people and and this is what he says one thing beginning at the fourth verse one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I see seek after you can't just lay still and not do anything I will seek after that I may what dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple now you must understand David is not talking about the manmade Jerusalem David amen is speaking about amen that new city that new heaven that that new place that God is is preparing for us he said I I have one desire that is to live wherever God is living now he goes on said but in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pilion that means God is going to have a Sheltering Place amen for you and I in the secret place of his Tabernacle right in the secret place of his tent shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and understand what that means set me upon a rock means that he will give me a revelation that when when the storms come remember Jesus said who is the wise man the one who builds his house upon a rock when the winds comes when the storms come and beat upon the house the Bible said the house will not fall because he's built upon a rockl what rock the revelation of who Jesus Christ is hallelujah come on now we working with something right now because you know it's really difficult because sometimes we fail to see that we say we we become Antichrist when we deny that Jesus Christ want to live live in our flesh Hallelujah come on Amen the Bible said if if you can't believe that's John that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh you're Antichrist let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus amen rightall amen so you got to believe that Jesus Christ want to live in your body not just for a moment in well F your Tabernacle he want to live through you walk through you talk through you he wants to do everything through you and you and I must come to realize amen this is the ultimate go oh my God I love the Lord why because he's made it so simple it is the seed that's in you that comes to Perfection not your flesh amen amen but that seed in you amen is that second Adam and that second Adam knows how to sedo the Earth put your flesh under subjection Hallelujah come on somebody 1 Corinthians 2:5 Paul goes on to say that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God hallelujah it ain't good enough Amen to know the message per se we need the power of the message Hallelujah we need the life of the message come on somebody that's what God is saying we're not resting Hallelujah I I I think somebody when when the the healing brother said thank God for the heal uh the Healer the healing is good but thank God for the Healer amen because the healer is a savior he's a deliverer hallelujah hallelujah that means he can do everything Hallelujah that we need him to do now we're living in a day and I'm going to tell you something even among ourselves you know you get we've got put it this way you and I Must Be watchful of the spirits that will anoint us the leodan spirit is loosed the spirit of scoffing is loosed the spirit of murmuring and complaining is loosed all of the spirits that that defeated amen Israel coming out of Egypt are still alive if you're going to put it that way they're loosed and they're here to anoint the Bride of Jesus Christ you said that can't be true it is true because the word of God said when the bottomless pit was open brother brand said the the the lid of hell has been open it's been taken off amen and so all those Spears from the anti-an day what what day the day before Noah right all those Spirits have been loose and they've been loosed on the Bride of Jesus Christ and the devil say you ain't got nothing Hallelujah he's got to pull all hell out to try to stop you and he can't do it why because the Lord Jesus himself amen whipped H Hallelujah and the grave Hallelujah he took all authority and power from the devil so if the devil don't have no power then how can his demons have any amen it's only what you allow them to do with your own own mind Hallelujah you can give them Authority that they don't even have by allowing them in your mind to have authority the Bible said he was stripped stripped of all authority of all power Hallelujah and the Bible said he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto man amen oh my scoffers the Lord delayeth his coming oh well you know ain't nothing happened since the Lord fell asleep ain't no change and what they don't feel what they don't see amen is that Darkness can't comprehend light Hallelujah come on somebody and that's what you and I must be careful that we're not walking in darkness because if the light is shining you will not comprehend it when it comes that's why you got to stay in the light walk in the light live in the light Hallelujah so that we may comprehend first Thessalonians 5:5 say you are not all you are all children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love you know faith and love are twins right you can't have one without the other Hallelujah and for helmet the hope of salvation for God have not appointed us to wrath let's say that God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ say it but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen so when the devil say you going to hell quote him that Hallelujah bring the word back to him God is Not pointing me to wrath Hallelujah but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we are awake or asleep we should live together with him oh whether we be awake or sleep come on somebody but here it is wherefore Comfort yourself together edify one another even as also ye do this is the hour we're living in the hour of edifying each other y'all hear what I'm saying I need you you need me Hallelujah we need to learn how to edify one another and if you're not feeling up to Park call somebody don't let the devil whip you Hallelujah that's the anointing that we're living in like the prophet of God said if there's ever time the Bride of Jesus Christ should be clish this is the time they going to call us a cult anyway they don't realize he man there's Baptist Cults Methodist Cults Catholic cults yes yeah they Cults everywhere yeah come on somebody and they look at us and say well y'all cult we look at all these other ones and like I tell people if you define the cult the way I've heard being defined amen following the man then the cathic church is the biggest cult there is hallelujah is that all right now the word of God comes along and says now listen therefore you know for God is Not appointed us to wrath but to obtain our salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ is that all right oh my goodness but let's move on to St John 58 I've got a lot of scripture and stuff Marvel not at this for the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live woo come on somebody he said there's coming a time don't Marvel at it he said but those who are dead shall hear have you heard him have you heard him amen therefore if you heard his voice the Bible said You shall live Hallelujah well I heard William brand that wasn't William V Brandon's voice that was God's voice you can you got to hear it you got to hear that a voice in a voice oh come on somebody I I'm enjoying this now but I I'm I'm I'm I'm going to shift gears here in a bit 1 Corinthians 15:51 because I don't believe that the put it I don't really believe that the message or we as a message people or group of people that say we following Malachi 4 really see how blessed we are above all measures nobody could have educated you into this it had to be revealed that's why you and I follow this thing no matter how much ridicule we got we can't help it we heard the eagle scream and we know who our father is see we can't help it and and I love that I love that amen because I can't help myself and no matter how many times I fall short I still run back to Mom and Daddy amen 1 Corinthians 15:51 oh the devil is so mad and he's doing everything he can do to stop this Rapture Hallelujah just like I said you got to take away the Roman seal Hallelujah you can't allow yourself to be sted you can't allow yourself to be cold come on somebody you can't allow yourself to be in a state of comos Hallelujah Hallelujah you got to make some motions in here you got to do something you got to contend for the faith and like I said when you contend for the faith you're not contending for just the letter of the word you're contending for the power of God which is the quickening spirit amen because that's the attack now amen they're attacking the the life of the message which is the Holy Ghost they attacking it Hallelujah and somebody got to be there to say I'm one of them yes I don't mind getting drunk in the Holy Ghost I don't mind running down the aisle I don't mind amen being drunk amen and staggering like a drunken I don't mind and I don't understand it because if people was understood the Holy Ghost it ain't the man that makes you stagger it ain't your man spirit is the Holy Ghost in you that's staggering hallelujah oh come on somebody your Holy Ghost is the one that's all operating your body yes sir you want him to talk through you but don't want him to dance through you hallel you hear what I'm saying that's the Holy Ghost dancing in you wo come on somebody that's why he said David is a man after my own heart what does happen to the dance you know I think people in for God Amen David said the ark has come back that means amen the cherubim the the the the the the Holy Ghost the god that lives between the Angels he's back in the camp now Hallelujah that means God can now reside against within my heart Hallelujah and so I can't help but to be happy I was telling the church there and I say it again you said well pra praise God I said you come to church all Saturday and everything the problem is you haven't been in the presence of the Lord Chop Chop amen you haven't been in the presence of the Lord because the Bible said in the presence of the Lord is fullness of joy hallelujah amen you've been in something else present but you in the presence of the Lord oh my God and I ain't talking about giving me a a religious smile I'm talking about Joy y'all know what Joy is joy joy is greater than being happy joy make you jumpen it's true Joy some of us hadn't experienced joy in a long time we don't forgot what it is we think Joy is just a smile you know Joy is greater than that Joy is when you're so happy it overflows you don't care about what nobody thinks about you oh it's true when I used to look at the prices white I hope y'all don't mind me saying this and I don't use that thing before they said Brother Bruce come on down who me okay I'm coming no sir there any one nothing yet they leaping they jumping they shouting they praising acting crazy on there hadn't even got the reward yet but because their knees was called and God has called your name and you can't show no joy W don't let the world outd do you get jealous listen people they ain't got no Holy Ghost that's making them jump that's just plain Joy amen listen and we find out he says listen but I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed all the denominational churches read this very scripture but all the denominational churches have don't have an understanding of what this is you do though thank you Lord they don't know the Rapture is already taking place they don't know it's already in motion they just think is all of a sudden God going to change them from filth to Holiness no sir is in process right now to the believer to the Bride of Jesus Christ than Hallelujah that moment is the last part of it that twinkling of the eyes is the last part of it Hallelujah but before you twinkle out of here you got to suffer you got to go through some trials you got to be Sanctified you got to be holy by the grace of God oh yeah yeah Hallelujah they think all of a sudden in a moment I'mma have on a white robe and you've been wearing shorts ah no no no no no no Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 15:52 say in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ and the dead shall be raised is Incorruptible and we shall be changed amen now what they don't understand is amen that the last Trump now we we we realize this because you know for a long time I thought well that last trump it must must must be when the when uh with Moses and Elijah no no no no can't be the last Trump has sounded that last Trump sounded under this the Thunders is that right brother I'm going to preach those trumpets God says no s you've already preached them when you preached the Thunders so the last Trump that already sh so the so the Rapture is already Hallelujah in motion people it's already in motion that's why people don't understand we're not just coming to church we're prepared we're making oursel ready for a translation for the trumpet for the Trump shall sound now why watch this and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible this thing is so powerful it's going to get them up you said what do you mean what do you mean brother BR because let me put it this way brother Brown said like this he said the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride Hallelujah I thought the voice of the Resurrection what is the voice of the Resurrection God took me back to the Book of Genesis when the Bible say the voice walked in the cool of the evening now who was the voice but Jesus Christ amen walked in the cool of the evening Hallelujah come on somebody amen who do you think spoke out of that bush when Moses heard The Voice Hallelujah it was none other than Jesus Christ Our Lord hallelujah you said that don't work well well who was the voice amen that Paul heard on the road to the Damascus who art thou Jesus who art thou Lord he said I am Jesus Oh My Hallelujah why do you persecute thou me Hallelujah and and Paul never persecuted Jesus per say but when you persecute Jesus people when you persecute Jesus body you're persecuting Jesus and when God came here amen so we can understand people well well I'm looking for his appearing his appearing is already come and gone and the people don't even know it but there's a coming a literal body that going to meet up in the middle of the air Hallelujah he appeared amen really he appeared before 63 but when that pillar fire that's what I was say the other day I said you know people come in here say oh y'all got a picture of brother random no the picture was a pillar of fire he just happened to be in the picture it's like somebody taking a picture of brother Keith right now Sister Vanda is sitting behind her him well I take a picture and she's in it amen but I was taking a picture of keithen you see what I'm saying the picture was being taken of the pill of fire and he just happened to be there come on somebody Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my amen so we looking at this thing and you say oh brother BR in a moment of The Tweak of an eye yes at the last Trump oh my god oh Jesus have mercy and we realize now I don't I don't know how true it is but I believe it you know uh the the the uh uh it have to bring it back to my mind but the the prime minister of of Israel that's in in in the coma now and now his body is deteriorating all right and they had a prophecy by this Renown H uh uh Theologian uh he was a priest uh uh one of Israel great leaders in the teaching and you know he he he he had visions and he went in and out of them and and he he revealed to Israel some years ago amen that that Jesus was the Messiah that was after his death and he prophesied that when when uh s Sone amen when he died that's when God will reveal himself to the Jews now just in the last few weeks his body has been shutting down on him if this prophecy is true and we know God had revealed to this orthodox Jew that Jesus Yeshua was the true Messiah they thought something was wrong but they proved his handwriting was correct now if that be the true how much time do we have left because when God reveals himself to the Jews the pride is already gone it's that much time time left remember folks it's a secret C in away and none of us know when the door is shut help us Lord L amen so listen let's move on for this corruption must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality you hear what I'm saying put on Christ Jesus that's the word put on Christ Jesus how do you put on him by the Holy Ghost by the virtues of God by the by submitting yourself dying to you say I don't know how to do it you know how to ask the Bible said we have not cuz we ask not and when you ask you must ask in faith like James say hallelujah hallelujah so when this corruption shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory I never understood that but Victory every piece of character you gain is a victory amen hallelujah and oh come on somebody and when you get victory in virtue when you get victory in longsuffering when you get Victory you swalling death up you swallowing death up in your Victory Hallelujah and then when you seal it with the Holy Ghost woo death has been swallowed up swallowed up in Victory whose Victory yours come con the land it still say conquer the land oh Lord hallelujah swallowed up and when this corruption have put on Immortal incorruption and this m shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory in no age outside of this age have this been possible people well you know I had the Holy Ghost before 1963 you did did the Pentecost is had it everybody had a measure right amen but when the fullness of his when he knocking at those whole man God when he came Hallelujah it was in the evening time Hallelujah God hallelujah and that's what this message brought to us hallelujah the fullness of Christ Hallelujah so God can clothe you completely oh come on somebody there nothing but the truth this corruption must put on incorruption this Mor must put on immortality oh death wears your sting oh grave wears thy Victory The Sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God oh my God oh my God oh my God here it is don't miss it thanks be to God which giveth us giveth g i v e t h continue to give amen us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah every time you climb the ladder it is God who's giv you the victory you don't believe that the Bible said amen that uh uh Jacob wrestled with the angel and overcame an angel but you know the only way he could overcome the angel was by faith come on no man no fleshly man can overcome an angel only the faith can move a mountain hallelujah hallelujah so your Faith amen it's a thing that CES you up amen if you can believe that you can be holy you can be holy if you can believe you can be perfect you can be perfect come on somebody it is it's right here you believe that you oh he said have faith in God he that cometh to God must believe that he's God and that he's a reward of those that diligently seek Him woo therefore my my beloved Brethren be steadfast don't you move nowhere unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I listen let me put it this way God going to put you to the test ain't no using you thinking that you're not you GNA get out of here without a test God is going to put you to the test and guess what he's such a light he knows how to shine to the depths of your soul and he know exactly what you love the most and that's what he's going after amen amen he going right after that thing that you love the most and you know what he's going to tell you give it up amen he did it with Abraham give it up come on somebody he oh he did it to the Rich Young Ruler give it up you can't give it up you can't go up that's it he going to come after that because you're going to have there's no other God before me no other God hallelujah and that's what happened to Rich Young Ruler right that little ruler he loved his money more than he loved God hallelujah then he found out that that that that that his money there was nothing he had could that could exchange for a little drop of water down there in Hell come on somebody first Thessalonians listen I'm going to go on now that's what you know I told you I believe it was not long ago prayer is the key you know prayer is the key you know you don't go in the closet to play hide and go seek you going in there to pray huh you in your prayer closet and the Bible say whatever you do in private he will reward you openly right now first Thessalonians 5:17 look what he says pray without ceasing that means you can't pause there there's no intermission you got to constantly pray y'all hear what I'm saying God ain't just talk about on your knees he said on your feet while you walking while you talking throughout the day you must have a prayer going on incense going up before God is that right in everything give thanks oh it's true I was telling my wife the other uh today I said I went into a star testified to this last night and you know ain't nothing nothing the devil jumps on you when you know you're the first one in the restaurant and somebody else come in and they wait on them before they wait on you right and they know they wrong cuz they can't even look at you in the eye right but oh my that devil wanted me to say something so bad Oh my he kept talking to me the whole time trying to mess with my spirit and everything else Hallelujah then the Holy Spirit spoke to me and says do unto other Hallelujah as you would have them to do unto you Hallelujah I probably gave her the biggest tip she ever had that that whole day and you know what I wrote on a ticket God bless you Hallelujah come on somebody I felt like Samson I had just conquered the Philistine y'all hear what I'm saying y'all don't do y'all know what I'm talking about amen yeah and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you so it's the will of God for you and I in everything oh Lord this pain is bad thank you because you know this pain that you got God can take it from you in hell the pain is not taken away there's always ways to look at situations Hallelujah come on somebody and y'all done heard the story The Man complaining about having no shoes until he saw the man who had no feet Hallelujah there's always somebody in a worse condition than you are in hey come on somebody I'm not homeless hle oh my God I might be down the road but right now I'm not and if that should happen I'm gonna thank him anyhow y'all hear what I'm saying quench not the spirit woo and y'all know we do it holy spirit comeing here amen and we we shut down on them you feel them want to move on you you want to scream sometime you want to holler and it ain't nothing worse than here have people say you know I really wanted to run huh you really wanted to run no you didn't it came to your mind that you wanted to run but if you really wanted to run you would have done it every man does what he wants to do quench not the spirit that's not just in shouting and dancing that's in calling somebody praying for somebody encouraging somebody whenever the Holy Spirit leading you to do something and you iow to do it later despise not prophesying right oh my God he's preaching on me too hard he talking too much to me why did he look at me like that huh come on somebody oh my prove all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from the appearance of evil oh oh

appearance of evil you can abstain from Evil and I pray God that your whole woo spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless no fault no error nothing against you amen until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ this is my punchline Faithful is he not Faithful Is you not Faithful Is Me Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it I believe it I believe that he's going to do it he promised me Abraham see I don't know how he's going to do it me Sarah we old age we we over 190 years old but he promised me anyhow I believe he going to do it Hallelujah I don't care what sence say I don't care what my mind say I believe he's going to do it it's already done far as I'm concerned hallelujah oh my first Thessalonians see we got to have faith in him if this Covenant is true which it is it is an unconditional Covenant that God chose you and elected you to be bride unconditional mean he said I'm going to do it he already judged the thing before you even came to it that you weren't even capable of doing it Hallelujah he judged it Hallelujah but you got to want it to Hallelujah that's how you some people how do you know you bride CU there's something on the inside that desire to be perfect something on the inside of you desire to be perfect no matter how faulty you appear every day something in you said there's a better me somewhere there's a better me somewhere I got to have that nothing satisfies me like the presence of the Holy Ghost Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God brother said in his descension all three of these are being done and the dead in Christ should rise first is that all right then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with him and everybody ain't going to see the dead in Christ raised hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen I can remember me hearing on the tape just the other day brother bam said you know when when Jesus rose from the dead there was a powerful earthquake said all of them soldiers ran he said listen something's going to happen in the heavens people I'm going tell you know why because he said when Jesus when it was time for him to get up he said that star that morning star moved out of its place Hallelujah now if it happened in that Resurrection it's going to happen in this one amen hallelujah he said that morning star moved out of its place and before you know it it came down to heaven like a ball of fire amen come on somebody Hallelujah he said amen and that those soldiers saw it they Dro everything thing and ran and yet they can have the courage to say Amen that that his body was stolen away Hallelujah but there were those who were glad to see him there were those who were glad to see him Hallelujah and let me tell you something when Mama and whoever else that gone on that's died in Christ come back and you see him oh you're not going to be afraid Hallelujah oh my God Amen you'll be so happy I love God for that you know that's an extra he gave us hallelujah brother say 30 to 40 days they'll be walking around we'll see him amen so how if you're not spiritual how you going to see them the Bible say we got to even be careful that we entertain angels unaware I wanted to write that on my ticket after I left said oh I wish I'd have known that cuz she was I'm a minister I'm a preacher I'm an angel to this church that's the scripture hallelujah amen I wanted to write that thing down and you know but you know what God it gave to me I said the next time because you know what I really believe that lady was a Christian a denominational Christian who had been momentarily influenced by a bad Spirit that's what I believe because when I start talking on the phone and saying thank you Jesus look like something just I was talking to somebody on the phone and saying yeah the Lord this and Lord look like a conviction came over the face something happened there something happened and I think it was a a teaching experience for me and a teaching experience for her amen you love the Lord oh my amen he says listen do what Comfort one of these Comfort one another with these words what time now the time is so hard on us right now don't tell me y'all not having a hard time yeah this is not an easy Road no sir carrying across is not easy y'all hear what I'm saying it's a bumpy cobbler road that we're going through right now come on somebody amen and when you tired you think Jesus had a lot of energy when he oh come on that's why he fell underneath the load Hallelujah and sometime we hit our knees underneath the load and we need a Simeon to come help us we need somebody to come help us lift that thing up Hallelujah come on somebody you see me down help me carry my cross I ain't going to ask you to take it from me just help me carry it but of the times and Seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you but of the times and season you have no need your you for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief of the night but when we say peace and safety then sudden Destruction come upon them as travaileth a woman with child and they shall not Escape shap but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief there is no excuse if we miss the Rapture is our own fault because we chose to walk in darkness rather than light and the Bible said if you choose to walk in darkness the Bible said men love Darkness because their deeds are evil oh come on somebody Isaiah 54 and7 I hope you're being blessed tonight we're living in a time where we've got to we've got to enter into this chamber this chamber I looked I looked that up that means bedroom brother Brandon brought it out he said you know your you're a three room room house come on somebody you're a three room house amen the living room dining room the bedroom that's where Jesus meet you right it's got to be an intimate relationship between you and God not tomorrow now and people of God is like this you draw n of God God will draw not of you Isaiah 5474 in a small moment have I forsaken thee but with great Mercy I will gather thee Hallelujah I will gather thee I'll snatch you I'll gather you I'll grasp you I I'll bring you into my presence nobody can do that but the Lord Jesus is that all right now how many of y'all know we on a pilgrimage huh when you're on a pilgrimage it's not easy you think about those pilgrims that came all the way from England all the way over here on a a a a strange voyage and didn't even know where he was going there was no stop sign no stop lights there was no road maps no nothing the only thing they had was a compass H oh my something struck me all I got is a compass and that's the North Star hallelujah amen that star amen keeps me alive with the word oh my listen what he says in Israel in Egypt he said oh Jacob in dying standing before Pharaoh he said I have been so many years in my pilgrimage amen what was it what was he he began to come to himself listen he began to come to himself the little fell had done so bad he knew that he was only a pilgrim here now notice we come on down down to the eth verse and God promises Abraham here how he's going to save him and his seed after him now he made the Covenant unconditional it isn't just exactly what uh that he made it just because you know and I thought about I said Lord look at Abraham he messed up he did so many things wrong God knew it God knew Abraham was going to do everything he did wrong but what did God do rewarded him for the things he did right he got the king in trouble you see what I'm saying amen and you you you he didn't even separate from lot like he should God had to raise up a battle and God then when he comes to his son then God rewards him like Abraham has done everything perfectly right and in the eyes of God he did amen right see he made the Covenant unconditional it isn't just exactly uh that uh he made it just because he was Abraham now Abraham if you will do this if you will do that he said Abraham I've done it already it ain't nothing you got to do I've done it myself amen oh my when I think of that God did it himself unconditionally God Covenant is unconditional you say well brother I I quit eating meat I don't do this brother don't have one thing to do with it did you know Amen in oh amen how God says he said when that uh Holy Spirit uh begins to fall it will bring us to a Perfection I just listened to the message today but my point is what we fail to see it's the word it's the spirit that Quicken it's the anointing that breaks the Yoke I don't care how much words you hear you want don't allow the anointing in your life you will be dead letter knowing the word but powerless you got to have the anointing to be powerful the Holy Ghost is the power of the word and we got so many people amen that knows what he says but it's powerless it isn't whether you eat meat and don't eat meat or keep Sabbath days or new moons or whether you go to Sun school on Sunday or what it is this is you know it won't be no jealousy in heaven but God knows when I get up there I want some rewards I don't want to be the least in Heaven you no th those people that do nothing be the least you get there but your your your your outfit would just be plain now I know you say it it won't matter but why if it doesn't matter why does God make the difference some people going to have a lot of Stripes you think everybody going to be dressed alike brother R tells you that even those people amen that came running to him was dressed in different garments you going to have priests prophets Kings all of that and they will all have different garments but yet holy oh come on somebody sure really study your message then you'll know but you know the difference is there won't be no jealousy there won't be no jealousy nobody will be there amen wanting to be me they'll be so glad to get there y'all hear what I'm saying you say oh I don't understand the whole concept of it but why would God say to brother Brandon because you have chose the hard way and your choosing is correct the right way I have given you a huge por he didn't say a large large is that good but huge a huge portion when you think huge it's huge everybody don't get a huge portion y'all hear what I'm saying but because of who he was because of the work he did he chose and every every one of us must choose the harder way is this okay folks and if you say brother you have no desire of nothing of the world and your whole heart centered on that you can't keep away from it but as long as there's a tug there you know there's something wrong yet now y'all hear what I'm saying now yet uh now election God called Abraham told him he was going to to save him unconditionally now let us go over here after the promise of and got got a little later I want now he goes on and say but he says now listen you're not where you're supposed to be if there's still a tug oh my let's move on I don't know what time it is I don't want to keep you too much longer but my point is this I haven't even read some of the things I want to read but let me read let me read a few more quotes here so because I don't want to forget is we're coming in a time and I'm going to just run through it Israel Israel was was tried right remember in Deuteronomy he says and thou shalt remember all the ways which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the Wilder to Humble thee to prove thee to know that what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his commandment or no and every test and trial we have is God proving us amen and we if we make it he he sees where we desire to love do his word if we falter he see we're not there yet but every trial amen and test we go through God is trying you right amen now listen the Bible says according to Psalms 37:39 but the salvation of the righteous is the Lord he is their strengthen in time of trouble so if you don't have him you won't have strength in time of trouble amen let me read that again he is their strength in time of trouble and he cannot be something you've imagined it must be a reality he said in that day you know I'm in the father of the fathers in me I am in you so it must be that's the only way listen what the prophet says know the ones at the end time till it would even be so real he said the the the two between the false I'm saying these things because we're not just working with worldly stuff we're working spiritually here too he said till it would even be so real till it would deceive the very election possible now how you going to How Did we tell it in them days how you going to tell it today the same way stay with the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now care all this message and when you listen to the tape even maybe I'll be gone someday when the Lord's finished with me here on Earth you refer back to this listen to my voice what I'm telling you if he takes me before his coming just remember I spoke to you in the name of the Lord by the word of the Lord yes notice be so close together that would that would deceive the elected if it were possible what do the signs the same Miracles by The Same Spirit would do the same sign same Miracles by The Same Spirit is that right just like the prophets was that you just we just talked about prophets now also written let's turn to it in in uh uh this one if you want to Second Timothy three let not leave this one and I don't want to I look at the clock up here okay I want to ommit a lot of it and I I don't think we should do it now if I'm standing here first faring like I I see I am but I'm happy and I know that this is true Paul the man who said if an angel come from heaven and speak any other word to you than that which I said let him be cursed not an angel come down right now an angel come down right so he said he goes on and he says now but what what is brother Ram trying to tell you he said I preach the same message Paul preached and if Paul said it I can say it stay with what I said and if anybody else come preaching differently let him be a cursed that's powerful so is that all right now let me let me let me go on cuz I want to hurry up quickly my when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty let me tell you something that's happening now you working on a job or working in in in somewhere where you got Sinners they gonna speak evil of you they'll set you up don't ever think that a sinner going to take your side even if you right they love their own come on somebody and you must Realize by the grace of God you can't say I'm a friend with the world because the Bible said those who have friends of who is a friend of the world is God enemy you know why because your friend of the world is going to get you to compromise they're not they going to do their thing oh y'all done got quiet on me now but it's true anyhow it's true forgive me that was that was me forgive me for that I'm not hot I was just like the fire you know come on somebody okay you tired just act like you're looking at a television right okay now when my mother and my father forsake me the Lord will lift me up right cuz if you looking at a good picture you going you going to Bear it you going to work it you going to watch it right your body will say go to sleep but it's so good you looking at it just act like you're looking at a TV amen the unfailing word God still remain true to his word because you got to realize we're looking at something that's going to cause us it's what we call Brother call us the squeeze squeeze you know who who who who who betrayed Peter somebody that was once a church member she was there she said I saw you you were there you're one of them she could identify him y'all hear what I'm saying and Peter got out of that by swearing and cursing like a sinner right so that he could separate himself oh come on somebody and think about this the whole time he was doing that he failed to see that Jesus was looking right at him and when he caught the eyes of Christ he was oh you can't imagine I can imagine how he felt but I'm going to tell you something every time we do wrong Jesus is standing there looking at us God who can create squirrels who can take away tumors he's still the same God tonight for it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe that heavenly father who is my witness with this uh uh this Bible over my heart know that word by word of that is true as I know how to say it what good would it do me to say something wrong friends what am I saying this for that is my encourage you to believe now that gift that great gift other others I tried to explain and say how it was done this can't be explained now just wait it will not be in operation so perfectly now wait till the Council of churches bring on the persecution see he says listen he said now don't get discouraged about this thing because really you cannot make it happen but God has designed this thing to bring you to Perfection like he did with the Hebrew boy he set the fire up seven times harder Hallelujah so this Perfection that God is going to completely bring us into that will bring forth the translation and I'm not saying amen that that we're not where we should be but my point is God has designed this thing to full is like when the challenge come when The Showdown come amen the Mount Zion Showdown down come amen that's when the Bride of Jesus Christ will show her color right amen we wait till the counsil of churches bring on the persecution that's when it'll happen that's the reason I come back among you to pray for the sick I have never had one but but one thing that he ever told me in my life that I know that hasn't happened yet that same sort of a building or tent where there be a little building setting and I have to go into that and pray for the sick that hasn't happened yet as as far as I know that's the only thing that I know and when he says those words to say it the heavenly father knows that I stand here tonight and he would kill me right here in the platform yes sir he certainly could do it and I know that I I'm well aware of that can I read on and I know there's so many stories today I ain't responsible for them I'm only responsible for for that what I say I've got to answer for what I say and that is the truth and the heavenly father knows that is the truth now will you believe Jesus Christ the son of God died for your sins and was wounded for your transgression with the stripes you were healed do you believe it in this day when just look like everything is black and dark and dull but yet Jesus remained the same you know I can read a quote overseas like this and they'll be screaming and shouting it's true and I wonder I thought I think sometime we a lot of us don't scream and shout over the word and when a quote come understand if it's connected to the word do you know what God is doing to you building your faith we don't get excited but it should excite us right amen I know I've been long and I'm I'm going cut it short but don't y'all go out there and stand another 30 minutes now no y'all do what you want to do I'm just messing with you but you know what I'm saying it it's time for Fellowship then that's okay do you believe that he he's here tonight I want somebody to rise and tell me anything I ever spoke in the name of the Lord besides that but what happened and how many hundreds of times that you've seen him say it it's never did fail what I'm trying to tell you it's totally impossible for a human being to do that it's Jesus Christ among the people is Christ among us today denominations are saying come in here comeing come there it's the old trend of some school or something which is perfectly all right it has to be there it's part of the symphony but to me he's a living tonight just as powerful and strong to make every word real that he did back there I read one more quote and I'm going let you go later in you that's on my paper that's so fitting that didn't amen if the Holy Ghost can just pour into you still you you know I use that expression just act like you're looking at the television I've used that everywhere I go so don't don't don't don't think I'm singling nobody out please don't because I say that everywhere I go because that's what people people they don't understand the undivided attention they give to a television ver is preaching if the Holy Ghost can just pour into you till you're so drunk you forget what your name is Grant it Lord grant it Grant it granted amen till you forget all your doubts get you so drunk on the spirit till you forget your doubts then you can get somewhere with God right then the cry once more goes up from you know what sincerity and then hallelujah filled with the Holy Ghost these drunk on the spirit God righteousness Holiness and power get you so drunk till you forget who you are you're nothing to begin with remember God wants to come into you once more Lord once more once more Lord once more oh Pentecostal Pentecost is run for your life there's just a little time left is later than you think if I never say another word from this pull pit remember run for your life is later than you think I feel the Holy Spirit on me saying saying it again run for your life is later than you think once more Lord once more feel Life Tabernacle once more feel Higher Ground Tabernacle with eternal life every member in here Lord and let the glory of the Lord fall upon this congregation Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah I believe God once more Lord once more let men forget who they are let men forget his unbelief that we Could Cry Oh Lord once l once more Lord once more do you love him once more Lord once more oh my God have mercy on us Lord amen amen we we we realize tonight amen that there's coming a change but like I said by the grace of God you know there got to be more out of us let's suppose no I won't I just say it like this it's got to be more God is asking for more you said I'm giving all I got maybe so or giving all I can give but I think if we could all think about that statement it wouldn't be true we're not giving all we can give and if we were God wouldn't be calling for us to give more you know it's like it's like any any coach you know and I I've seen it happen you know even even myself when I was in high school you know uh out there on the football field and you feel like you got to die you going to die from the Heat and everything else come on hit it again I mean he he's driving you and pushing you and and literally you doing it something you thought you couldn't do cuz in your mind you've already limited yourself and that coach is to break is to drive you beyond your limits walls that you placed in your mind that's how records are broken because somebody decides in their heart and their mind I'm going Beyond right and I'm saying by the grace of God people we are living in a day that it's hard for me to explain I just know what I go through on a daily basis and I know if I go through something y'all got to be going through something too you know I wish I could truly say that every day I come home my my day is hotti hot and never goodby hallelujah praise the Lord you know I try to stay in that atmosphere I do but it doesn't stop the devil from coming right he's still going to try to break the force field yeah he's still going to try to penetrate that that right amen so what happens is sometimes you you get to a place and you think you say well Lord I you know you get weary in your flesh y'all know what I'm saying not so much weary in your soul but weary in your flesh and when you get weary in your flesh here come the devil right he knows exactly when the attack you right but we fail to see when we get weary where to go one touch from the Lord he can he can equate to you eight hours of sleep by One Touch ain't nothing impossible for God he quickens us people and we must learn by the grace of God to to get next to God follow him with all of our heart our mind our soul I'm not done with this but we will complete by the grace of God this coming Sunday we've got brother Gabe Smith from Ohio coming right and then I'll be ministering Wednesday no no no I'll leave out Wednesday going to Harmony in the desert for the chy be ministering while I'm G I think but anyway by the grace of God we just know uh by the grace of God that God's will will be done and uh so people pray for me as I pray for you
