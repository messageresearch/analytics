for you bringing us in this place oh Jesus where else could we go back to you and we are so glad that we serve a God who never misses an appointment Lord look at each and every one of your children

you give the answers that each and everyone needs oh God because you are our all in all and it is in you that we find our peace and everything we need oh God but look as we about to get into your word you know any man who's educated can read the word but Lord it is only your anointing it is that action that can activate that word and make it alive oh God I pray oh God that you make this word live from the pages of the book right so that he resounds with Our Lives oh God so that we might say for sure the Lord spoke to us come and have your way Lord as we yield ourselves unto you saying Lord please come and have full preeminence in your son Jesus Christ mighty name we pray believing amen amen amen whilst we are standing let us open our um Bible's the book of uh Luke and chapter 10 verse 23 amen Luke chapter 10 verse 23e if you can switch the um translat this microphone to the wireless one and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which he see [Music] and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answered and said Thou shalt love love uh the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor is thyself and he said unto him thou has answered right this do and thou shalt leave may the Lord add blessings the reading of his word we take our seats amen I want to pay particular attention to verse 26 and he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou so uh for a short while this evening you want to speak on how readest [Music] thou amen I don't intend to take too much of your time this evening in the church ages the prophet of God says it says blessed are you if you hear it and read it of this prophecy so there is a blessing in hearing the word and there's also a blessing in reading the word so if you have the grace to read and hear the word you get a double blessing amen amen and the word of God will be a blessing to you if you read it correctly because they many people who misconstrue the word misinterpret the word just like Satan came to Eve and he quoted the exact same word that was in the word of God but then he twisted it when you twist the word of God and you change it there is no blessing in it it doesn't have the power that it has cuz it's no longer the word of God so when you have the word of God it goes back to the question how readest thou how are you reading it's just like in the scripture we read when the lawyer came to Jesus trying to tempt him and Jesus saw that this young man was trying to tempt him and he asked him how readest thou so that's our title this uh evening hallelujah hallelujah so you know the message of the hour is a message it's not just words that written it is not just a message but it is a message that has power power to transform hallelujah hallelujah and it is not not meant for everyone it is meant for a special class of people in the church is the prophet of God says it says this prophecy is for a prophetic class of people so if if you are not in the prophetic class you will not hear anything because your ears are not tuned to to hear those prophetic utterances remember in the Old Testament when God spoke the people would hear thunder and the Thunder wouldn't mean anything to people but the prophet because he had his ear tuned to hear the voice of God he would hear exactly what what God was saying and then decoded and tell to the people hallelujah so you are a prophetic class of people your ears are tuned to hear prophetic utterances your ears are tuned to hear thus says the Lord when everyone else does not understand what that is you can hear and when you hear something resounds in you because you have been predestinated you have been set aside Hallelujah that's what the word of God calls us call us a particular A peculiar people peculiar means that you are special the prophet of God says your soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds that's why Satan is after you because he knows your value there's a little story of this little boy he stumbled across his stamp and then he just assumed this temp had value and this little boy the only thing he wanted was ice cream and he took that collect that collected stem to the ice cream man and said I believe this stamp is valuable can I exchange this stamp for an ice cream and he exchanged it and he got his ice cream and went away happy the ice cream man took that stamp he exchanged it with something else that he wanted and that little stem moved different hands but eventually it landed in the hands of a man who knew the value of collected stamps this stamp was worth [Music] $500,000 and he went and cashed it in and he got that $500,000 but people all along the chain of line they were just trampling over it they were just valuing it like ice cream but it was worth much more hallelujah hallelujah so people in this world might not understand your value but but God knows your value that's why he calls you his son that's why he calls you his daughter that's why when you pray he hears your prayer Hallelujah he says if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves he said I will hear from heaven because you are his people hallelujah and we his people are made Vessels of Honor amen so how how readest thou and we thank God for the word hallelujah hallelujah in this word it describes who we are from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 they are full of prophecies full of promises amen am this is not just a historical book you can't read it as a historical book but you won't get value out of it amen but this book is a book of life amen amen Peg from cover to cover with a Timeless prophecies that spans from dispensation to dispensation remember Christ is the same Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever so I'm reading Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and he say let there be light I don't know how many years that was but if I need life in if I need light in my life I will go and call and say Lord you said let there be light and that word still has enough power to bring light into your life because when God speaks remember his word does not go back to him void but after it is accomplished that which he has spoken for only if you read the word right hallelujah hallelujah and Paul tells us that the things that are written in the Bible therefore are for an example for us so something that's an example if you've been in school you know your math teacher will work out an example on the on the B and say hey everyone copy this example and you take that example and go back with it home so that when you face another problem you look at the example like how was this Pro how was this problem solved the same way the problem was solved the the problem that you have will be solved so the things that are in the Bible as an example for you and me for you to know that if God did it before he can do it again hallelujah hallelujah if he's gave an example of Abraham and Sarah who had been Barren for 25 years and he gave them the promise it is an example to you it's not only that God gives children but whatever situation you've been waiting for God can still bring it to you it is all how you're reading the Bible if you read about Moses uh God opening the Red Sea for the children of Israel it is an example for you to know that when you are between a rock and a hard place God will always come and open a way it's for you to know that God he a way maker he's a miracle worker he opens a way where there is no way and he opens a road where there is no Road and not only that that he will also destroy enemy so you don't have to go around looking for for water lakes for you to open but whatever you red SE is God can still open it because that's what he does he the same yesterday today and forever if he did it before he can do it again if he did it for them he can do it for you too Hallelujah it is all in the word how R is thou how do you read that word and we know the prophet of God talks about there being three Bibles the first Bible was the Zodiac where God put signs and symbols in the sky [Music] he created the universe and put the different planets in there and each and everyone he put each planet in its own orbit that was the first Bible but you see each and every of the stars and the planets that he put each and everyone knows to stay in its orbit each and everyone knows to stay in the place that God placed it you will never see the stars fighting for position saying no me I want your orbit come and take this one we are the stars the sons of God remember God told Abraham your sons shall be like the stars of heaven so we should never ever fight for positions and say I saw that one I also want it to be for me but stay in your lane stay what God called you to be because your anointing and your blessing is in the position God placs you hallelujah hallelujah and in the Z in this zodiac they had to have men who were trained and they used to call them Watchmen so if they wanted to know what was going on they had to come and ask uh Watchmen what of the night and the Watchman will be in the top Tower he looks the position of the Moon the position of the star how much light it is and he could tell what time it was and they were all seeing signs and they could read it but it needed a special kind of skill you needed to learn how to read the sky to read the Zodiac and it wasn't for everyone and we read about the three mag [Music] eyes the three wise men they were reading the book of Daniel and Daniel was writing about the Zodiac and they knew that these three if these three stars align it means that Christ the Messiah has been born and they studied it and when they saw those three lines they made a trip all the way to Jerusalem they uh they went to Bethlehem and when they um when they got there it was after 3 years of traveling they were searching for the Messiah so that was the that's the first Bible the Zodiac and the prophet of God talks about the Virgin Cancer and Leo all the different [Music] signs talking about the three different comings of the Lord amen amen and we move to the second the second [Music] Bible which the prophet of God tells us is the pyramid and also for the pyramid not everyone was able to read the pyramid the pyramid was was built in a meticulous way and it was accurate it has it was built to specific cubits amen amen and we know all the all the mysteries of the Bible are in the pyramid with all the different measurements breaking it down into different Mysteries what's in the Bible but you needed to study and and be well versed and be very much skilled for you to be able to read and know the pyramid and it has all the different seven steps leading into the king's chamber ing the seven Church ages until Christ comes unto his throne but not everyone was able to read the pyramid you'd have to wait for someone to come and explain it to you but we thank God we leave in a dispensation of the third Bible which is written in text you don't need a special kind of person to come and uh to tell you each and every one of us you can read your own Bible Hallelujah and you can read the mysteries of God from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 by yourself amen we thank God for that in the Bible we read about uh the unic from Ethiopia he was in his Chariot and he was reading in the book of Phillip I mean in the book of Isaiah and Phillip was at a convention and the spirit of God told him go over there and on his way going [Music] there he saw this un reading the the book of Isaiah and God told him get closer to him and when he got closer to him he asked him do you understand what you are reading the man didn't know what he was reading and says how am I going to understand if there's no one to explain this to me and Philip came and jumped into the Chariot and started explaining to him who Jesus Christ was and at the opening of the word at the expounding of the word this man called the Revelation and he says what forbids me to be baptized they saw a pool of water and both of them got in and the unic was baptized and when they got out the spirit of God took Phillip and took him elsewhere and he traveled like a thought amen this was in the book of so the same God who who wrote the book of Acts remember the book of Acts is the only book that is not punctuated with an amen it is like that so that the children of God the sons of God can continue writing the book of Acts because it is not the Acts of the Apostles but it is the book of the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles so if you have the Holy Ghost if you don't have it you need to ask for it so God can fill you with the Holy Ghost so you can perform the same acts so the Holy Ghost can perform the same act he was performing in those Apostles amen amen so you need to read the word and know what the word is saying about you and when you are reading there is there is you need to read in between the lines let's read on Israel and the church number two paragraph 54 the prophet of God says you know if you read the word right like this here it's all right but you sure miss the meanings of it the word is written between the lines Jesus said I've hided from the eyes of the wise and The Prudent and revealed it to babes such as we learn these theological seminaries are just like them priest was back there and the high priest and all of them that read the word but failed to see Jesus being the Christ so the Pharisees were people who devoted their whole life studying the [Music] word they knew the Scrolls from cover to cover and in the very word they were reading they knew that the Messiah was coming and they were preaching in the synagogue the Messiah is coming whilst at the same time the Messiah is just down the streets performing Miracles they missed the word because they were not reading in between the lines and it wasn't meant for them because the word Jesus says the word has been hidden from the eyes of the wise and the Prudence but it has been revealed to the predestinated the elected of God those who are willing to learn so Jesus was right in their midest and they are still waiting for him to come but he has already come and he was there walking performing Miracles they were busy criticizing and attacking him they didn't know the Messiah was actually coming someone knew he was the Messiah but they were not reading properly they thought he had come to fight and overthrow the Roman government but that's not what he had come for he had come to save you and me so those Pharisees and all who were reading the the Bible in a wrong way they missed him all together and they were saying he needs to be crucified because he's blaspheming but they were not reading right amen and every time you are reading the word right you need to see Christ Hallelujah huj in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet of God says paragraph 121 he says he is the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse in it go read it again hallelujah hallelujah if you can see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you've missed something the Bible is Christ he is the word and when you read in the beginning God created there is Christ in there every from that to the Amen in the in Revelation is every word testifying of Jesus Christ amen so the prophet is telling is if you read the Bible and you read a verse and you don't see Christ in that verse you are not reading it right go back and read it right because Jesus is the principal theme of the Bible from Genesis 1 and 1 to revelation 22 and that's how you have to read it pure as it was given unadulterated in paragraph 130 he says and you inject something in there that does not make him the same yesterday today and forever if you add Creeds and dogmas in the word going to work so here we see the author is telling us how to read the word the word is telling us how to read the word for it to be effective in your life so how are you supposed to read the Bible when you read the Bible see Christ in each and every one of them if you have missed it go back and read it because that's where your blessing is hallelujah hallu so we know Christ is in the word because the the Bible tells us in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God amen amen and he goes on to say on that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me and you are in me Hallelujah so when you are reading the Bible you are supposed to see Christ and you knowing that you are in Christ you are supposed to see yourself on the pages of the Bible because he is in the Father the father is in him and you are in him so Satan going to know he can't put your his dirty hands on you because you are he in Christ Hallelujah because um the word of God said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Greek original translation it says in the beginning was the Lo Ghost and the Lo ghost was with God and the Lo ghost was God and the logos is Jesus Christ so in the beginning was Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was with God and Jesus Christ is God and that's in the word he is the word hallelujah hallu so you got to know I am in the word every time I read the Bible I got to see myself in it because I am in Christ Hallelujah when I read about Jesus Christ I shout amen because I know I am hid in Christ Glory that's the word read it right he comes to tell us how to read it Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 11 the disciples came to Jesus um 1310 let's start from 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered unto he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given hallelujah amen so Jesus was teaching in Parables he was always telling stories and in those stories as much as they were simple they went as deep as they could and remember a parable is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning so in public Jesus would tell stories and they don't know what he's talking about but after the crowds had left he went in secret with his disciples and he started giving them Revelation and he started revealing what he was saying in public because he said this is not for them because it is not given for them but it is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven remember you are a prophetic class of people who supposed to hear prophetic utterances so when when you read the word you need that inside teacher that when you are by yourself he comes and give you that Revelation that each and everyone else does not have the Bible says God gave his son so that he could die for whosoever whosoever believes in him the world says he came to die for everyone no he did not he came to die for a special group of people and those people are whosoever those he didn't die for who refuse the grace that he gives them because that makes him that that make it seem like he's an unfair God many people struggle with predestination see God Is So unjust why would he choose before the foundation of the world who who his children the ones who were supposed to be in heaven and reject the others he said Jacob have I love and Es have I hated but God predestines by full knowledge so before you were born before he said let there be light he knew that you would accept his word and he knew those who would reject it and by his for knowledge and for knowing he predestinated you and you put your name in the book hallelujah hallelujah so these people whom it is not given to they don't understand it they won't even want it because they are not called to it but because you are called to it even if you don't understand it right then and then you believe it anyways because you know it is true because remember you and me we are not called to understand we are called to believe it and when Jesus was giving those Parables he starts saying he tells his disciples there was a man who had two sons one son decided to get his inheritance and the other one decided to stay the good boy and the one who was a rascal went away in the public they thought he was just giving a story but when he was giving the Revelation the disciples knew he was talking about and he was giving the uh parable of the prodal son says the son went away in a far away country he started messing with the wrong crowd lost everything he had became homeless and started leaving with the pigs and one day was he was leaving with the pigs he said and he thought he says but my father's servant they are eating better than what I'm eating right now I'm going to humble myself and go back to my father's house when he was giving the disciples the Revelation they got to know he was talking about them those who were predestinated and when this son realized it's time for me to go back he was homeless smelling bad old torn clothes probably he un camped and he decides I'm going home but when he was going on his way back home the story says the father saw him from AAR off the father was waiting by the gate he was waiting he was waiting for his son because he knew that one day one day one day my son would come back he has the same blood that's flowing in my veins and he was standing right there by the gate day after day cuz he knew his son was coming and then he saw him from afar off with his step and says that is my son Hallelujah and when the son came no matter how smelly he was no matter how bad he had gotten the father embraced him and says my son welcome home he was just telling a story but they didn't realize that he was talking about you and me remember the son did not lose his sunship when he went away he just lost the relationship with the father Hallelujah so you were a son you were born a son despite before you saw the light before you accepted Christ as your savior you were still a son the bad the evil that you did your sins does not take your sunship away from you but it is just repentance that brings you to the realization for you to know that I am a Son of God and you should know that at any time when your eyes are open no matter how much sin you have committed the father is always waiting for you he's always waiting with his arm stretched out welcome home my son welcome home my daughter it does not matter what you have done you will still my son don't let the devil bring condemnation on you you tell him I don't care what I have done in the past my past is my past I am going back to the father and when I go back to the father he's not going to make me stay with the servants I will stay in the house with my father because I am his son so he was talking to them in Parables amen amen so that's how you were supposed to read the word the author is telling you how to read the word of God see yourself in there every time you don't read the word right anytime the word is misinterpreted or misplaced it will bring mistreatment of people you have so many people who post Bible verses on their statuses each and every day and you be like oh that person is a Christian after you have spent two years posting those scriptures on your status how do you treat people because you can just be putting the word there but the word is not in you and so how readest thou remember the Pharisees they went and saw a woman who was committing adultery and they brought him to Jesus and they says we have caught this woman in adultery and they wanted to see how Jesus was going to [Music] act and they were using the scripture in Deuteronomy 22:22 that says if a person is caught committing adultery they supposed to be stoned and they brought the woman this holier than thou man but that was not the that was not the full word they were misplacing scripture and misinterpreting it the the word they were using the scripture they were using it says if a man and a woman are in adultery [Music] both of them are supposed to be stoned but due to their Prejudice and misinterpreting the word it caused them to mistreat her and they brought the woman only without the man and they said we saw her in the act so which means they saw the man and the woman but they let the man go and they caught the woman and he said you need to be stoned and then Jesus was there they were trying to test him and Jesus stood there and he says who he who doesn't have a sin throw your first stone throw your stone he knil down and he wrot something in the each and every person who came who just read one by one they all went away amen everyone went away within a few moments there was no one there Jesus came to the woman and said where are thy accusers there was none of them all of them had gone why because Jesus was using the same word but he was applying it correctly and the Word was Grace he says go see no more and it's just not go and repeat it again but when you apply the word right go and see no more hallelujah hallelujah so brothers and sisters you need to read the word the way God intended it for you and me that's the only way that word will have effect in your life in Hebrews chapter 9 uh 9:17 it says that a testament a testament is only of effect The Testament is only of effect when the testator is uh is dead for for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator leaveth so which means all the people who wrote those books those books were valued or they were of effect they were effective after the writers were dead amen so we know many religions there are many testators there who wrote the word who wrote their uh who wrote their word and after that they died but we know of one testator amen who wrote the New Testament he died but he didn't remain dead he got up and he is living in my soul Hallelujah so you know the test The Testament is only of effect when the testator is dead so the person who wrote it has to die first for that Testament to be effective so Muhammad wrote the Quran so the Quran is not effective wouldn't be effective until Muhammad died but here's the thing God wrote the word and this word is alive when you start reading the word the writer of the word will come to anoint you because remember he is the inside teacher so whenever you start talking about Jesus he comes right next to you remember those two men who were going to EMAs they were not just talking stories they were talking about Jesus and because they talked about him he came right there and he started revealing the word hallelujah so when you read the word when you start talking about the word the writer of the word comes to explain the the word to you and gives you the revelation of the word that you are reading that's why this is the only book that lives out of it flows life out of it is eternal life zo is the Life of Christ himself that's why each and every other religion is a false religion you can go read the Quran if we start reading the Quran right now Muhammad is buried in Saudi Arabia he's not going to come to explain you what's written in the Quran because he's dead and gone you have the Buddha they have their own Bibles but Buddha is not going to resurrect to come and explain that word to you you have Krishna over there they have their Bible when you start reading krishna's books he is not going to come and give you Revelation because it's a dead religion the only religion that is alive is the religion of Christ because he's the only one who resurrected and he can come and he gives you the revelation of the word Hallelujah huj so you talk about him you know he's coming and I can tell you this evening that he is in this place Hallelujah why am I saying that because the word of God tells me whereever two or three are gathered in my name he said I'm there in their minut so all you need to do is reach out to him and when you reach out to him you can touch him remember that woman who had an issue of blood all she did she just reached out and she touched the Hem of His Garment and she was healed immediately he was the word that was walking on two feet Hallelujah hallu so if you read in between the lines the Messiah the master will come and explain it to you and he will give you the revelation of it the prophet of God says every time I travel my wife my wife writes me letters you can take that the letter his wife wrote to him you're not going to see nothing there but when he reads it he probably already knows where she is seated when she's writing that letter and in one line there is so much that said right there but because you don't have a relationship with her you do not know nothing except for what is seen when you have a re when you have a relationship with the author of the word he will come and show you what's written in between the lines and he will reveal all the Mysteries that is in there Hallelujah so remember Christ is in the word and you are supposed to see yourself in the Bible hallelujah hallelujah there's a story of this young boy who went to visit his relatives so this boy used to live in The Villages he had never seen um he wasn't exposed to to to civilization and then whilst he was wandering around the and his property he just started walking around and he saw himself he saw himself looking at him he waves his hands the person who looks like him waving at him he jumps over to this side the person in the the person over there jumps over as well waves the other hand the person waves back he starts jumping up and down the person started jumping up and down as well he had never seen it before he was looking in the mirror he had never seen a mirror before but because he saw his reflection he went off running to his mama and he says Mama that is me I saw myself in the mirror Hallelujah each and every time you come to church you are coming to look yourself in the mirror of the word all the promises in the word of God you are seeing yourself and when you see yourself in the word you got to jump for joy and you say mama that is me in I know it is talking about me Hallelujah one person was given a spoken word and he started reading and he he brought it back to his friend say the book that you gave me is calling me a bazard voucher and he says the book that you gave me is calling me a voucher and he was mad not a c a voucher whatever voucher is and he said the book you gave me is calling me a voucher and the friend says that's surprising he says that's surprising because the same book that you're talking about just told me that I'm an eagle how readest thou the person saw themselves at the bazard so the word of God does not lie to you it just shows you who you are if you hold up a mirror it's not going to show you someone else it is just going to show you as who you are amen amen so this brother saw him self as a as an eagle because he was reading the word right amen and when you see yourself in the word you can see that God is talking about you and remember God uh in the in the verse we read earlier Jesus told these disciples that these Mysteries the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven are meant for you Hallelujah so when the Mysteries are revealed they are for a chosen people and your name is written in the book so your name being written in the book it's not written as a government name because your government name is how you are known when the Pharisees came to John the Baptist they asked him when the Pharisees went to John the Baptist they asked him who are you are you uh are you are you the prophet who supposed to come are you the Messiah and John didn't he says no no John could have said I am zechariah's son Zechariah was a priest he would have used these credentials and say yeah you know him my father is one of you I'm zechariah's son but he didn't give his name when they asked him who he was he said I am the voice of the one crying in the wilderness that was his name and his name that was written in Isaiah so when he was asked what's his name he gave the name that the Bible was talking about him he didn't say I'm John the Baptist he says I'm the voice of the one who cries in the wilderness he was identifying himself with the word he was identifying himself with what he had seen himself to be in the mirror of the word of God many people say we don't see William Bram in the word sure because his his name read from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 there is nowhere written William brandham but we call him malach 4 because that's his characteristics in the Bible so that's his name in the Bible what is your name your name is the mystery that is in the Bible Hallelujah so John was the word the V the voice of the one crying in the wilderness he was the he was that word made flesh walking on two feet William Bram was Malachi 45 walking on two feet you are the bre of Christ you are supposed to be the word the word made flesh Hallelujah huj so in the mysteries of the book your name is in there remember your name was written in the lamp's book of life before the foundation of the world there is a book of life that contains names of each and every one of those who ever lived [Music] and in that book of life your name can be blotted out then there is a lamb section of the book of life that contains your name and my name those who are predestinated those who are called out and your name can never ever be taken out of the L Book of Life Hallelujah because Jesus said all of them that you gave unto me I will lose none of them so if your name is in the book written before the foundation of the world remember Satan can't do nothing about it because he wasn't there when it was written Hallelujah huj so if your name was in the book was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world nothing can happen to to you Satan cannot do you no harm he can take you out because he's not the one who put you in hallelujah hallelujah so your name was in The lamp's Book of Life and when Jesus came to die on the cross he was dying for those name who was in the lamb section Book of Life when he was in that Garden of G and he says Lord if it was up to me I let this car pass and remember he had an option to not go to Calvary he could have just decided like never mind I'll will go live a nice life he grew up being a carpenter he could have opened a carpentry shop [Music] go get himself a wife and get some kids and leave a nice life but while he was in The Garden of Gethsemane he saw the names of those that were in the book he saw you he saw me then he says nevertheless not my will but let your will be done and I will go all the way to the cross and he went via delosa suffered all the way for you and me and he shed his blood for you and me because he had to redeem all the names that were in the lamp's book of life so you can never ever be lost amen amen Paul in Philip chapter 4 verse one he says and I in treat thee [Music] also through your fellow I probably copied it wrong find it you can find it and I entreat thee also Philippians and I entreat thee also true your fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel oh there you go thank you and I entreat thee also true your fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the Book of Life how did Paul know that their name Clement's name was in the book of life because he was the messenger of the age he was the messenger of Ephesus so every time God brings in a new age he reveals Mysteries and when the mystery is revealed the messenger of the edge he catches it and the Mystery is not hidden [Music] anymore and then he takes that revealed mystery and gives it to the people those that are predestinated so it's only those who are predestinated who have their names in the Lamb's Book of life so how did Paul know because he was the messenger of the age given that Revelation to catch the whole mystery of God for that gen for that uh for that age and who has believed our report in paragraph [Music] 41 here the prophet of God says God in Jesus Christ's name I pray that you heal the woman Grant it save her from every sin forgive every sin that she did as she stood here before these many thousand people with their hands up and she believes and accepts you as uh you as her savior look at this we know at this very moment her name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life for she has confessed you before man how did William Bram know that this woman's name was in the Lamb's Book of Life because he is the one God sent with the mystery he's the one God revealed the mystery to so that he can tell the people of this uh Leia generation age to catch that mystery so the messenger of the age who is on Earth at the time he catches that mystery and that mystery becomes his ministry Hallelujah cuz remember in Revelation amen amen that the by the time the seventh angel begins to sound all the mysteries of God should be finished so all the Mysteries would have been opened and he will start preaching that mystery and in that mystery you will hear your name being called your name is not John is not written as Paul your name is not written as Jack that's not how you see your name in The Book of Life but your name is said in the characteristics so when you hear that mystery being said when you hear that mystery being revealed you hear your name being called something attach something in you attaches to it because you have been called for that age and you have been called to that Ministry to that mystery Hallelujah so the the will of God for your age is the message of the hour so the message of the hour is calling out your name come out of here my people you are seated where you are seated right there because you heard your name being called Hallelujah and those that he called he will never lose any one of them amen because that's his people hallelujah so how do you read read it the way God intended it for you and when he has revealed and called out your name you got to he to that call Hallelujah because your name is written in the lamb section in The Book of Life Satan can do you no harm Hallelujah let us stand upon our feet amen amen we thank God for the message of the hour that came to open our eyes and let us know that our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that will never ever change remember the story of Mama eag she had her egg and
