[24:01] a man shekinah unending is all I long
[24:34] for it is a thirst and desire that I
[24:38] have day by day in one of these old days
[24:44] where international never to come out
[24:48] again a man ain't God good I thought I
[24:51] cut it on brother I'm sorry I was
[24:54] wondering why we weren't blending a man
[24:58] good to see everybody we're not going to
[25:02] prolong the time amen
[25:06] we appreciate the Lord Jesus for being
[25:09] so good to us
[25:10] as we stand let us turn to st. Luke 21
[25:15] we're trying out to be long I tried to
[25:19] preach this message in Iowa City I don't
[25:22] know how far I got with it but I was
[25:26] just being pooled by God to go in a
[25:28] certain direction and that was the way I
[25:29] I did go but anyhow God is good to us
[25:36] and we are blessed people we are blessed
[25:41] people I just my heart cries out and as
[25:46] I was saying this morning in Iowa City I
[25:52] want to see everybody make it a rapture
[25:57] we know the prophet of God said it's
[25:59] going to be a few and because we belong
[26:03] to a little system called a message the
[26:08] message is not systemized but men have
[26:12] done so but
[26:14] individuals who are free and will always
[26:16] be free because he whom the Sun sets
[26:20] free is free indeed
[26:22] and I just don't want to see people come
[26:25] to the end of the road and find
[26:27] themselves falling short
[26:29] I mean God warned us in the Word of God
[26:32] many of times but I feel like some of us
[26:37] are not paying attention to what's
[26:39] really happening and one of the things
[26:42] that Jesus even told us that we must
[26:45] watch and pray and we have as Christians
[26:48] many of us have lost our prayer lives
[26:51] and you know brother Ben who tells us
[26:54] that when we do that we're like dead
[26:56] we're dead Satan you you you've allowed
[26:59] Satan to come in at will when you lose
[27:02] your prayer life let's read this please
[27:05] Luke 21 34 to 36 and take heed to
[27:11] yourselves lest at any time your heart
[27:15] be overcharged with safaree
[27:18] and drunkenness and cares of this life
[27:23] and so that they come upon you unawares
[27:27] now watch this verse if I always
[27:31] mispronounce it so 14 amen so far teen
[27:35] it means to excessively over indulge in
[27:42] eating and drinking think about that it
[27:48] means to uncomfortably be full or
[27:54] crapulous feeling due to excessive
[27:57] eating and drinking now
[28:00] you may not think that's much but the
[28:02] Bible said it is and he tells us that
[28:07] Satan is laying a trap or snare look
[28:11] what it says for as a snare shall it
[28:15] come on them that dwell on the face of
[28:20] the whole earth
[28:23] and you know the Bible tells us that
[28:26] this is the day that
[28:28] we'll be eating drinking and giving in
[28:30] marriage partying having a great time
[28:35] eating is not necessity necessity is a
[28:39] pleasure you know and I know that we
[28:43] most of us most of us eat for pleasure
[28:45] and not for need Watchi therefore and
[28:49] pray always that you may be accounted
[28:53] worthy to escape all these things that
[28:57] shall come to pass and to stand before
[29:00] the Son of man is this ok let's go to
[29:09] 2nd Peter 2:9 I really do appreciate you
[29:15] waiting on me
[29:16] I trust service was really good this
[29:20] morning
[29:21] amen second Peter 2:14 having I'm sorry
[29:29] I'm second Peter 2:9 the Lord know how
[29:32] to deliver the ungodly out of temptation
[29:35] and to reserve the unjust unto the day
[29:39] of judgment to be punished let us pray
[29:43] father God we come before your Lord we
[29:46] thank you for your amazing grace we
[29:48] think you for being so good to us Lord
[29:51] been better to us then we have been to
[29:53] ourselves we pray father for the service
[29:56] that your perfect will be done Lord we
[30:00] surrender all to you Lord touch this
[30:02] body of mine strengthen it Lord and give
[30:06] us grace to move completely out of your
[30:08] way and father we'll be careful to give
[30:11] you the praise glory and honor in Jesus
[30:14] Christ's name we pray amen
[30:17] you may be seated what I've been working
[30:22] with by God's grace it's just the fact
[30:24] that there are two things happening and
[30:29] as a prophet of God said these two
[30:30] things this thing has two things have a
[30:34] grip either God is gripping you or have
[30:37] gripped you so he can pull you in to
[30:41] this image of God or Satan has gripped
[30:46] you with the mark of the beast and I
[30:51] feel like there's something moving that
[30:54] a lot of times people are not aware you
[30:56] see people don't run to say I'll take
[30:59] the mark of the beast we understand by
[31:02] the prophet of God he says to reject the
[31:06] Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:07] is to receive the mark of the beast and
[31:12] knowledge has never saved anyone because
[31:19] this world is full of knowledge there's
[31:23] only one provided way and that is to be
[31:28] filled and sealed by the Holy Spirit
[31:32] there is a mocking going on and we know
[31:37] that a mocking is something that will
[31:39] distinguish you from something else
[31:42] the first marking was Cain when Cain dis
[31:51] basically argued with God disrespected
[31:55] him and refused a man to do as his
[31:59] brother Abel had done we understand by
[32:03] God's grace that God marked King and one
[32:06] of the things that Cain did afterwards
[32:08] is that he moved from the presence or
[32:12] out of the presence of God brother
[32:15] Branham liked it like this he went to
[32:17] the Land of Nod he went to the world
[32:21] basically to find a wife and then God
[32:26] raised up Seth and the Bible said that
[32:28] men then began to call on the name of
[32:32] the Lord the prophet of God actually
[32:35] likened that as a death and resurrection
[32:40] so you and I must understand by God's
[32:43] grace that there are things that you and
[32:48] I understand first of all God is never
[32:53] wrong
[32:55] he's always right secondly God never
[32:59] hybrids every see must come and be at
[33:06] his own kind even when it comes to the
[33:11] sons of God God tried to keep them
[33:14] separated because he knew the trick of
[33:18] the enemy and the enemy was to get into
[33:21] the human race and he did as you and I
[33:25] have heard you have heard how that God
[33:28] told Adam to multiply and replenish the
[33:31] earth and Adam never was able to
[33:33] accomplish what God had told him to do
[33:36] because he fell and he replenished the
[33:41] earth with what his own kind and the
[33:46] serpent and after trying to oh at the
[33:51] end of the day we find out that the
[33:54] serpent seed replenish the earth and
[33:56] Adam only had eight seas left and that
[34:00] was the family of Noah and the Bible
[34:04] said as it was in that day so shall it
[34:07] be in this day something took place and
[34:13] everybody it just seems like when it
[34:16] comes to those of us who around the
[34:18] message we we almost at ease things I in
[34:20] Zion and this is not a time to be at a
[34:23] ease watch and pray the Bible says we
[34:26] need to be on a lark Satan is doing all
[34:30] he can do to to to to deceive us and the
[34:36] Bible tells us that he can transform
[34:38] himself into an angel of light he could
[34:42] look like a real revelation and the
[34:46] whole time
[34:47] is Satan in disguise thank God for a
[34:51] prophet and understand when I say that
[34:55] because there's a difference in our
[34:59] revelation than everybody else's we
[35:03] didn't do this God did this he said he
[35:06] hide it from the wise and the PRU
[35:09] thank God for election because it's not
[35:13] your intelligence or your smartness that
[35:16] gets you into this message it's what God
[35:20] has determined before the foundation of
[35:24] the world and the Word of God can never
[35:28] come back void I love that I love the
[35:32] fact that my beginning did not start in
[35:38] 1956 hallelujah but my beginning in your
[35:43] beginning started back there as a
[35:45] thought where God wanted to be a parent
[35:50] he wanted to be a mother and a father
[35:52] hallelujah and God's words shall and
[35:55] will come to pass nothing can stop it
[35:58] but we need to be aware of who we are
[36:03] and what we are remember I said that
[36:06] right because if you are born wheat if
[36:10] you are the seed of God there is nothing
[36:14] that can stop you from your destiny
[36:18] hallelujah no matter what you go through
[36:21] how many times you fall how many times
[36:25] you come up short God has already
[36:28] predetermined me is that right and the
[36:33] Bible tells us that God has given us and
[36:37] expected in something we can look
[36:40] forward to hallelujah Satan hates that
[36:44] he cannot stop you but he can't hinder
[36:48] you you understand me but for every
[36:52] purpose that God has purposed in his
[36:54] heart for you he may be able to hold you
[36:57] up for a moment but in the mind of God
[37:00] you will accomplish everything that God
[37:03] has told you you will accomplish
[37:05] hallelujah can nothing stop you you
[37:09] understand me that's the difference a
[37:15] mark is different from a seal a seal is
[37:21] ownership
[37:23] when you're sealed that means God says
[37:27] your mind and you are going to make your
[37:33] destiny this box is so sealed it cannot
[37:37] be opened until it reaches its goal is
[37:41] that all right sometimes we don't even
[37:44] understand it meant we're where we what
[37:49] God is doing with us it because it's
[37:52] something that he reveals little by
[37:55] little little by little is that all
[37:57] right as you have heard me say before
[38:01] when God did anointed David King he was
[38:06] a little boy but he still was king he
[38:10] had to grow
[38:12] he had the mature hallelujah and God was
[38:16] with him every step of the way he said
[38:20] well what about Bathsheba God saw that
[38:23] before it even happened
[38:25] hallelujah is that right cousin Gordon
[38:28] brother Branham God saw the mixture he
[38:31] saw something he was going to mix and
[38:33] mix and mix and mix to come up with you
[38:36] so that the barrel could make a right
[38:38] sound hallelujah there could not have
[38:42] been a Solomon without bail Sheba no
[38:45] doubt David went by the wrong way but
[38:47] God told him all you had to do was ask
[38:49] I don't know how God would have done it
[38:52] but he would have done it
[38:53] hallelujah and look at this is Charles
[38:56] that even all things work together for
[38:59] the good of them dinner
[39:00] what love the Lord and those who are
[39:02] called to his purpose it had to be a
[39:05] Solomon and Solomon had to be a part of
[39:08] David because Solomon is the son of
[39:10] David and God liked love Solomon so much
[39:15] too he called himself the son of David
[39:19] so you and I must understand this God is
[39:24] never wrong as I said before and if
[39:27] there be any thought is in mankind is
[39:33] that right and as I said earlier to
[39:38] receive the mark of the beast is to
[39:41] reject the baptism of the holy ghost is
[39:44] that right now you say okay brother
[39:48] which I understand that but don't you
[39:51] thank God for the fact that you know the
[39:54] Holy Ghost is not all of these emotions
[39:56] I love every bit of them I love the
[40:00] shower I love to dance
[40:02] I love the worship I love the praise God
[40:04] but at the end of the day I love change
[40:08] I love the fact that once you change you
[40:12] change from glory to glory to glory to
[40:15] glory until you reach that goal
[40:18] hallelujah you don't change you it's the
[40:22] seed of God that God has in you that
[40:25] changes you hallelujah and no matter how
[40:31] much a a burro would love to be a
[40:33] wheat you can't do it unless God changed
[40:39] the nature of the kokuboro
[40:43] is that right even the scripture said we
[40:45] all had the appearance of the children
[40:49] of Wrath is that right and we know the
[40:53] Prophet God said we were born that way
[40:55] we look we had the image and everything
[40:58] else as the children of the wrath but
[41:00] inside of the inside of the inside woo
[41:05] was a wheat germ and what God needed to
[41:09] do was quicken that and if your
[41:12] quickened you have nothing to worry
[41:15] about
[41:18] hallelujah
[41:19] you say what do you mean brother Brooks
[41:21] because a true seed of God could never
[41:26] receive the mark of the beast I used to
[41:30] wonder Lord how all those people in the
[41:33] day the nor why could they God they were
[41:36] sons they had the appearance of sons
[41:39] because they were the sons of Adam
[41:42] hallelujah but it was the soul of those
[41:45] people that determine what they were
[41:48] and they locked themselves they mopped
[41:53] themselves because when the word of god
[41:55] came and threw Noah and Noah preached
[41:58] because they separated this self from
[42:02] the voice they mocked themselves and
[42:05] they received the mock hallelujah
[42:12] but those eight souls who followed Noah
[42:16] within the door and went through this
[42:19] the three stages of justification
[42:22] sanctification and the baptism of the
[42:24] Holy Ghost
[42:25] three levels hallelujah and it was that
[42:30] Ark that brought them over to the other
[42:36] land you understand me it was what was
[42:39] in them that God preserved because all
[42:43] flesh was destroyed but it was the soul
[42:47] that was in those eight Souls that God
[42:51] was looking at is that right so is it
[42:54] today our flesh is going to be destroyed
[42:58] but the soul that lives the song has
[43:03] been quickened the song it meant that
[43:05] have the holy spirit sealed are those
[43:10] who cross over hallelujah and it's okay
[43:16] you know the lineage of Cain you know
[43:18] they're so smart ain't nothing wrong we
[43:21] having a little brain a little smaller
[43:22] but you know they think they thought
[43:24] because of their brains because of their
[43:26] intelligence you know they were better
[43:28] than everybody else is that right that's
[43:31] why Cain could not accept God's offer
[43:34] because he thought his uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
[43:37] how could I say his provided way was
[43:41] better than God's provided way yeah and
[43:44] that's what happens let me tell you
[43:46] something no system can save you I don't
[43:51] care what you in Baptist Methodist
[43:53] Pentecostal even what you call a message
[43:56] because you come to message Church but
[43:58] that's what I tried to tell somebody the
[43:59] other day what distinguish you and what
[44:01] makes you
[44:02] Church is this picture of making you a
[44:04] message Church Oh what about this
[44:06] picture make your message Church not
[44:08] even the symbol makes you a message
[44:10] Church hallelujah
[44:12] a message Church is an individual with
[44:15] Christ on the inside
[44:16] God don't care about all that stuff but
[44:22] that's the deception everybody gotten
[44:25] got McDonald's you know golden arches
[44:30] this is what is likened to not trying to
[44:33] be blasphemous but every church must
[44:37] have these because if they don't they're
[44:39] not a message Church yeah that's the way
[44:43] people think that's the way they've been
[44:46] brainwashed but let me ask you something
[44:48] when the squeeze come on and we don't
[44:50] have a building to come on you come to
[44:52] do that does that mean you're no longer
[44:54] messenger the message Church is not a
[44:58] group of people they individual whom God
[45:02] is justified sanctified and filled with
[45:05] the Holy Ghost living the message of
[45:07] their day people get offended because I
[45:14] look at all of these churches thousands
[45:17] of people and just like the brother over
[45:19] there in the Congo a man who had that
[45:21] priest ordained him that upsets me
[45:24] because that's a friend used to be a
[45:26] friend and as far as I'm concerned he
[45:29] still is but I remember when he used to
[45:31] be humble and now he's got a Catholic
[45:35] priests ordaining him and everybody's
[45:40] screaming you know what everybody I
[45:42] couldn't see this camera real good but
[45:44] the true seat of God wasn't excited
[45:46] about that hallelujah receiving the mark
[45:52] of the beast that's just what the
[45:53] Pentecostals just did a few years ago
[45:56] and here we are doing the same thing and
[45:59] here we are worshiping you know why they
[46:02] were able to do that because they let
[46:05] men take away the voice of God from them
[46:10] hmm don't you ever spout listening to
[46:13] your tapes don't you ever stop reading
[46:15] your
[46:15] books and like I said it is a shame that
[46:19] God has to raise somebody up to tell us
[46:22] to play the tape a shame its outright
[46:26] every buek because you should have never
[46:30] stopped hallelujah
[46:34] oh come on somebody everybody want to be
[46:37] an eighth angel forgive me sir but I
[46:42] can't find it in the word the only
[46:46] eighth angel I know is Jesus Christ
[46:47] himself because he's eternal Oh
[46:53] everybody you know every country got one
[46:55] you know I won with a real eighth angel
[46:59] stand up everybody
[47:03] y'all-y'all oh yeah y'all I'm telling
[47:05] you oh my is that right people listen
[47:15] what has happened and people do not like
[47:19] this what I'm getting ready to say don't
[47:22] you understand if you're not following
[47:24] truth when it comes to Jesus Christ you
[47:28] have come become a cult
[47:32] y'all hear them saying what I'm trying
[47:35] to say is this that's why brother one
[47:37] said whatever you do don't let yourself
[47:39] become cultish right because listen when
[47:43] you leave Jesus Christ out of the
[47:45] equation you have become a car
[47:50] hallelujah oh come on somebody see God
[47:55] is never wrong the Bible said he'll
[47:58] share his glory with know me and you and
[48:03] I must understand God is not here to
[48:05] share his glory with you not me not
[48:08] anybody else
[48:10] is that right let me read you something
[48:13] here I didn't get to this this morning
[48:16] but I wanted to hear it is a men in the
[48:19] in Hebrews chapter 2 he says listen and
[48:21] by His grace
[48:23] so none will have any excuse oh if they
[48:27] could forget the
[48:30] messengers and remember is not the
[48:33] messenger it's the message he comes down
[48:37] again with us in the form of a pillar of
[48:40] light and he moved with the same
[48:44] miracles and signs and nothing out of
[48:47] the Bible
[48:48] staying right with the Bible oh nothing
[48:52] happen the Bible staying with the Bible
[48:54] this is the original quote book come o
[49:03] you and I we understand the position men
[49:06] have played in the Bible full of the
[49:11] Holy Ghost but you know what revelation
[49:13] 5 says none were worthy none not one was
[49:21] worthy to loose the seal to open the
[49:24] book 9 only one hallelujah and that was
[49:29] Jesus Christ yo you what I'm saying you
[49:33] said what do you mean brother because if
[49:35] you lose vision a loose sight or who
[49:39] redeemed you Satan will mock you he will
[49:47] mark you because that's what came did he
[49:52] lost sight of his creator and he felt
[49:56] like he could talk to his creator any
[49:58] kind of way
[49:59] you can't talk to God any kind of way
[50:03] when God said do something the best
[50:06] thing you can do is say yes sir I'm
[50:09] going to do it you understand me listen
[50:13] listen here's another that's the way to
[50:16] do it
[50:16] believe what did he what did he touch
[50:20] listen I love this because people said
[50:23] what brother branham healed me and
[50:24] that's wrong brother Brendan constantly
[50:30] tell us he'd never healed nobody how
[50:32] many times you heard on the tape oh if I
[50:34] could just if I could heal you I would
[50:36] do it but I must wait on him he said
[50:39] hallelujah and then he goes on and you
[50:42] know Jesus Christ
[50:43] I yield one person when I heard that I'm
[50:47] like oh my what are you saying here
[50:50] hallelujah but he did not as a man he
[50:53] said I can't do nothing except the
[50:55] father showed me hallelujah he said I
[50:59] see the father working I'm working here
[51:02] the two the two whenever I see him move
[51:04] I move it's like a wheel in a wheel
[51:08] hallelujah Oh glory to God he just
[51:11] listen this is what he says I've never
[51:14] seen that man but he was healed right
[51:17] there
[51:17] he touched the Lord Jesus who is present
[51:21] here take away listen what he said take
[51:24] away that unbelief from you forget about
[51:27] me being William Branham look at Jesus
[51:31] Christ he's the one that's here I
[51:34] challenge your fame in crisis name to
[51:38] forget about me and believe that this is
[51:41] the Lord Jesus here and see what will
[51:45] happen I don't care where you are in
[51:49] this building hallelujah why because the
[51:54] Prophet was finite but Jesus Christ is
[51:57] Internet hallelujah that's what happened
[52:02] to Israel they were mocked because they
[52:06] kept their eyes on the veil they were
[52:09] blinded because they kept their eyes on
[52:12] the veil and Hebrews said that veil will
[52:15] be lifted when they turn to the Lord so
[52:20] is it in this message but I'm tell you
[52:23] what I'm getting in trouble with people
[52:25] because I'm trying to show them Jesus
[52:28] Christ
[52:28] who is the author and finisher of our
[52:31] faith I'm trying to show them that
[52:33] that's the reason why we're in the
[52:35] condition we're in now because we put so
[52:38] much emphasis on brother Branham we
[52:39] glorify the man the creature more than
[52:42] we did the Creator
[52:44] hallelujah he's worthy of honor there's
[52:49] never been a man like that man outside
[52:51] of Jesus who walked the face of the
[52:53] earth I agree with that
[52:55] but when God took that veil
[52:57] oh he did not stay unveiled yummy he
[53:02] came back in the power of the Holy Ghost
[53:04] now he's occupy other bodies more than
[53:08] just one of many members party I was
[53:18] telling the church down there I said we
[53:21] got so many symbols up in our church a
[53:23] lady coming near she says is this a
[53:26] Christian Church she saw everything but
[53:29] Jesus you understand what I'm trying to
[53:32] say what are we projecting what are we
[53:39] projecting you say brother until you try
[53:42] to say Libra no it's like telling Knorr
[53:45] nor are the flood about the flood and
[53:49] leaving out nor you can't leave Noah out
[53:51] it's what God did hallelujah
[53:54] you can't leave brother branham see that
[53:57] the fact of the matter is God told Moses
[54:00] I mean Joe
[54:01] Joshua remember all Moses taught so we
[54:06] must remember all William Branham God
[54:10] used William Bradford to teach us is
[54:12] that right how many times he say
[54:14] something he says I had to go back to
[54:16] hear what I said
[54:18] he was so caught up in the anointing he
[54:21] and God will was one so my so he didn't
[54:24] even remember himself and people of God
[54:29] that same anointing is what God is
[54:32] trying to put in us no we're not a
[54:36] prophet we don't have that office but we
[54:39] are the pride of Jesus Christ and all of
[54:43] the bride have a portion of a little
[54:45] tent discernment and everything that
[54:47] comes with it but this is not a one-man
[54:51] show anymore there'll never be another
[54:54] one-man show until Jesus Christ show a
[54:58] man but what is I'm trying what am I
[55:03] trying to bring us to to a place to see
[55:05] that we're liberated but at the same
[55:08] time we must always be watchful
[55:11] is that right I mean if you go back into
[55:14] Leviticus it tells about the year of
[55:16] Jubilee right every seven years and you
[55:19] know how it all goes but if that servant
[55:23] loved its master and wanted to stay with
[55:27] the master God that master would bolt a
[55:32] hole in his ear right and therefore he
[55:36] was a slave for the rest of his life
[55:39] hallelujah and brothers that's why God
[55:42] don't want us to be unequally yoked he
[55:45] don't want us to go to denominations
[55:47] organizations and all of that and marry
[55:49] one of them hallelujah
[55:52] because there come a time when you want
[55:54] to escape you won't be able to escape
[55:57] because you married one of them that's
[56:03] the law that's the law but if you came
[56:10] in free you can go out free if you win
[56:14] in married you can come out marry
[56:16] somebody help me here see when you and I
[56:21] must understand hallelujah this message
[56:24] is so powerful shame of us if we missed
[56:27] it amen
[56:32] but how God has made it so it is easy
[56:34] you know that he said it my yoke is easy
[56:38] and my burden is light hallelujah and
[56:42] that's what he said and that's what he
[56:45] means
[56:46] hallelujah oh I'm having such a hard
[56:48] time
[56:49] only because you ain't dead enough a
[56:52] dead man a hard you don't have no hard
[56:55] time like I told you you can go to a
[56:57] dead man and kick him and he won't even
[57:00] run hey kick one of these folks right
[57:05] here you in for a fight and you and I
[57:10] must understand we're talking about the
[57:12] marketer now look what I said I
[57:13] read that scripture about being careful
[57:16] about eating so much now we all do
[57:21] there are times we all overeat we all
[57:28] unless God done gave us a beaker maybe
[57:31] God then gave some of us the victory and
[57:33] because I'm a fat in summer skin it
[57:35] doesn't mean that skating people don't
[57:36] over over eat but that in itself it's a
[57:42] snare because the more you eat the less
[57:46] spiritual you are ma Oh y'all know it's
[57:50] the truth
[57:51] when you finish eating you overeat the
[57:54] first thing you want to do is sleep you
[57:57] know the guy reading your Bible you
[57:59] don't forgot a man prayed you know you
[58:02] just want to lay and enjoy your rest but
[58:08] think about it do you think Satan is
[58:11] fattiness up for nothing watch the
[58:16] cattle they feed them cattle make it eat
[58:20] as much as they want to you know why
[58:22] because that devil knows I'm setting him
[58:25] up for slaughter that's the truth I mean
[58:33] if we had to run from the devil we
[58:34] couldn't run I don't mean to be funny
[58:40] but it's true can't even run a block
[58:42] without dying almost it's the truth but
[58:46] understand what I'm trying to say the
[58:48] Bible tells us that if you're not
[58:50] careful this would be a snare right
[58:53] think about it because you're so eating
[58:55] you drinking you just enjoying yourself
[58:57] his eating was not supposed to be meant
[59:00] as such such a pleasure as it is now but
[59:03] the devil knows the human being loves to
[59:06] eat I enjoy food I love it when it's
[59:13] pretty and I love it when it's good and
[59:15] that's that's I have to fight with that
[59:18] all the time every day
[59:20] I can't every day right and will smell
[59:27] something not even hungry and we'll take
[59:29] that car ya'll North the truth but
[59:34] what's going to
[59:35] happened when the doors are shut and you
[59:38] have come become so accustomed to eating
[59:42] people says oh no I'll never do he's
[59:45] about the Bible say did you receive it
[59:46] in your head or in your hand right and
[59:50] this wouldn't you say well I could never
[59:52] sell my birthright for food Esau did he
[59:58] saw did it he got hungry enough thought
[1:00:03] the devil thought see you're gonna die
[1:00:05] probably was the first meal he missed in
[1:00:07] a long time and the devil told him if
[1:00:09] you do you gonna perish if you don't
[1:00:10] right so that's what he does he he
[1:00:13] dramatized it he puffs it up and if you
[1:00:16] get you to listen to it just in a moment
[1:00:18] time you receive the mark God cut Esau
[1:00:22] off right then hello y'all see what I'm
[1:00:26] trying to say so I want you understand
[1:00:28] it comes so easily when somebody witness
[1:00:32] to you says hey this is the truth and
[1:00:34] the person so no I'm not going away I
[1:00:36] love my church right there
[1:00:39] God marks them the only way that God
[1:00:42] doesn't mark you is that he see a germ
[1:00:45] there there's a seed germ from the
[1:00:48] founders in the world that declares unto
[1:00:50] God that that's you you want to hear is
[1:00:56] that right Paul called the Cree calls
[1:00:59] Christians the bat blaspheme right so
[1:01:04] but God could not destroy him because he
[1:01:08] was a seed not only was he's a seed but
[1:01:11] he was a star in the right hand and you
[1:01:17] and I must understand that's what this
[1:01:20] salvation is so secure y'all heard me
[1:01:25] preach it one time
[1:01:26] it's fixed it's been fixed amen and
[1:01:32] nothing can break the fact that God has
[1:01:38] already ordained you and I to be bribed
[1:01:41] now I came to explain while I'm buying
[1:01:44] bride but I know that I am I can't tell
[1:01:47] you when that revelation dropped
[1:01:49] in my soul but I know that I am do you
[1:01:52] make mistake I make mistakes but I know
[1:01:54] that I'm bribed I know that I have
[1:01:57] become his righteousness and he became
[1:02:00] my sin hallelujah that's right
[1:02:04] listen what he says now y'all don't hurt
[1:02:06] me quote just a lot because I do in the
[1:02:10] east of seal but we do one thing when
[1:02:14] they look around with all of these
[1:02:15] powers upon them they saw Jesus only
[1:02:18] talking about Peter James and John when
[1:02:19] they went to the Mount Transfiguration
[1:02:21] and the real true believer don't care
[1:02:25] whether he's backing up a denomination
[1:02:28] or nothing about it he only wants one
[1:02:32] thing for you to see that glorified
[1:02:35] Christ make makes any difference
[1:02:39] see a real true Mount Transfiguration
[1:02:42] experience only glorifies Jesus Christ
[1:02:47] it didn't glorify Moses didn't glorify
[1:02:51] Elijah didn't glorify themselves didn't
[1:02:56] glorify nothing else but they seen the
[1:02:59] glorified Christ and in a true believer
[1:03:03] that's what's in his heart to glorify
[1:03:06] Jesus Christ
[1:03:07] that's what he's trying to get to the
[1:03:11] people to see and don't you know that
[1:03:14] it's difficult that is so difficult
[1:03:19] because we have and I'm saying I
[1:03:22] probably won't get invited to come to
[1:03:24] preach for nobody but I really don't
[1:03:25] care that might sounds terrible because
[1:03:28] I got enough work on my hands as it is
[1:03:30] but the point is we have commercialized
[1:03:33] William Branham so much and so long it's
[1:03:37] a shame and what it has done it has it
[1:03:41] has stumbled people who would perhaps be
[1:03:45] in the message right now but because of
[1:03:48] the way we handled it right I've been
[1:03:53] guilty I've not always seen it the way I
[1:03:56] see it now but if you true bride God
[1:04:00] will begin to open your eyes
[1:04:02] - what is truth and what is not because
[1:04:05] what we must understand is that when
[1:04:08] Jesus came in his day and fair in his
[1:04:11] day who was in the pulpit but Devils
[1:04:14] pre-chopped who had disguised themselves
[1:04:17] as Angels of Light and Jesus said if it
[1:04:21] wasn't if I had not come you will still
[1:04:24] have a cloak he said but now but I'm
[1:04:26] here I'm the light of the world I see
[1:04:29] what's in you is that right he said I
[1:04:32] would you look like that whites up look
[1:04:34] up but it wasn't me your dad means bone
[1:04:37] you look good outside with your
[1:04:39] religious garments on but I know what
[1:04:41] you are I'm agreeing with John the
[1:04:44] Baptist your serpents oh not in this
[1:04:49] message well you don't know your Bible
[1:04:51] because serpents show came out of Egypt
[1:04:56] with Moses hello
[1:05:01] did they not Dathan and Cora
[1:05:05] they were serpents they will preach us
[1:05:08] and they deceived and pull people away
[1:05:12] from the message of the hour and we got
[1:05:16] the same thing going on
[1:05:19] am I making sense it ain't gonna be but
[1:05:22] a few but I'm gonna tell you something
[1:05:25] you're marrying the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] and not the bridegroom I mean there are
[1:05:31] yeah you you're marrying the bride crew
[1:05:34] and not not the man that gives them away
[1:05:37] who you what you call it this yeah yeah
[1:05:40] ELISA let me just put it that way
[1:05:41] amen you're marrying Jesus is that right
[1:05:50] one of the great signs and I jumped that
[1:05:52] I told you I'm not gonna be long so I'm
[1:05:54] moving moving so that the thing that I
[1:05:56] want to say is this what was the great
[1:05:59] sign of Jesus Christ well in our day
[1:06:02] that said like this oh so I said well it
[1:06:06] was the healing it was not the healing
[1:06:09] it was healing in the Old Testament
[1:06:14] what is that right oh oh it was the
[1:06:18] raising of the day it was rain people
[1:06:20] were raised from the dead in the Old
[1:06:23] Testament he lied your bones right the
[1:06:27] men thrown he came back to life to
[1:06:29] Shunammite woman right the baby come
[1:06:32] back to life
[1:06:33] naming healed of leprosy in the Old
[1:06:35] Testament hallelujah
[1:06:38] but in this day what was it like brother
[1:06:43] Branham said there was he come to a
[1:06:45] woman at the well who she it was that
[1:06:49] discernment that declared he was the
[1:06:51] word because the Bible tells us that the
[1:06:55] Word of God is shopping it's quick like
[1:06:57] a two-year sword in his discerner of the
[1:07:00] heart the intents of the heart and is
[1:07:02] able to separate the joints in the
[1:07:03] marrow and that word living now in a
[1:07:10] vessel called Jesus whoa say woman go
[1:07:15] get your husband she says sir I have
[1:07:18] none he said you've spoken right you
[1:07:20] answered that you responded correctly
[1:07:23] said you had five you with one and the
[1:07:27] one you know and you have is not your
[1:07:29] own she saw we know ha ha ha that when
[1:07:34] the Messiah shall come see that what I'm
[1:07:36] talking about
[1:07:37] and you got to understand this later had
[1:07:40] to be after the scripture because it was
[1:07:41] over 400 years before they had a real
[1:07:44] vision four hundred eight hundred
[1:07:46] between that time can you imagine how is
[1:07:49] the United States I'll be 400 years oh
[1:07:51] yeah
[1:07:51] so think about how long that was before
[1:07:54] they had a vision or a voice but yet and
[1:07:57] still even when God wasn't moving
[1:08:00] there was somebody passing it on see God
[1:08:03] has never left himself without a witness
[1:08:06] hallelujah now you show up with a break
[1:08:09] but the prodigal says listen when I went
[1:08:13] to the Baptist Church and I found out
[1:08:14] they had doctrines I couldn't deal with
[1:08:16] so I had to leave there then I went over
[1:08:18] to my mother lost church and they were
[1:08:20] Methodists and I found out the day I
[1:08:21] couldn't deal with them he had to search
[1:08:25] for God if you want to say like this
[1:08:28] I led him through those channels so that
[1:08:31] he can see the thing that's right the
[1:08:35] only thing that's right is the Word of
[1:08:38] God even the Bible says seven women and
[1:08:42] none of them were faithful and that was
[1:08:46] a type in the shadow of type of the
[1:08:49] seven Church ages hallelujah in all of
[1:08:53] that none of them were faithful but God
[1:08:59] in His mercy and His grace kept those
[1:09:03] who he had in his mind from receiving
[1:09:07] the mark of the beast say don't do
[1:09:10] whatever you want but don't touch the
[1:09:12] oil in the wine hallelujah
[1:09:15] that portion you cannot touch thank God
[1:09:18] for the word is that Alright
[1:09:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:09:26] and forever it was that discernment huh
[1:09:31] it was that thing when when that prophet
[1:09:35] come to that that pool in that third
[1:09:37] pool he says God was going to show him
[1:09:38] you know uh-uh
[1:09:40] that's the second pool how he was going
[1:09:41] to discern the thoughts of the heart and
[1:09:43] in all of the things that was Jesus
[1:09:45] Christ the Son of Man in a son of man
[1:09:49] revealing himself that man could not
[1:09:52] have done that
[1:09:54] hallelujah it was God talking and as God
[1:09:58] talked he talked and as God revealed
[1:10:01] visions he had the vision he saw the
[1:10:03] vision he could call it out but no man
[1:10:07] can do that I don't care if they work
[1:10:10] the biggest Ouija board in the world
[1:10:12] only God can discern that way am I
[1:10:18] making sense no you said what what do
[1:10:20] you mean
[1:10:21] see it's that sign that is the sign of
[1:10:24] the resurrection
[1:10:27] that Jesus Christ is still alive huh
[1:10:31] the Old Testament showed he was alive he
[1:10:34] was God and those healings those
[1:10:37] miracles and all of that was he this
[1:10:39] gleaming
[1:10:42] from the book of life lamb took a life
[1:10:45] that was already established the blood
[1:10:48] of the Lamb that had been slain before
[1:10:50] the foundation the Lord this is the
[1:10:52] prophets word they were grieving from
[1:10:54] that pulling from that well if the Old
[1:10:56] Testament can pull from it what about
[1:10:58] the Lu we've got the real thing
[1:11:03] we got the Alpha and the Omega and
[1:11:06] people are afraid to believe the UH the
[1:11:10] things that caught that that that the
[1:11:11] scientists say is impossible impossible
[1:11:13] with me
[1:11:15] Jesus smoked that right he said it's
[1:11:18] impossible for a rich man you know to be
[1:11:21] saved right they thought he said no no
[1:11:23] no no it's hard for a camel to go
[1:11:26] through the eye of a needle but I can
[1:11:28] save a rich man you see God can save
[1:11:32] whoever he wants to slay
[1:11:34] Oh somebody help me here you see we
[1:11:39] can't almost believe this message almost
[1:11:43] festa said unto Paul you almost made me
[1:11:46] a believer
[1:11:50] you can't almost believe it you got to
[1:11:53] give it all your heart mind and so if
[1:11:57] you wanted to see it work right
[1:12:00] hallelujah
[1:12:01] it's like baking a cake you leave one or
[1:12:03] two agree ingredients it out it'll never
[1:12:05] turn out right in order to make it right
[1:12:08] us use all the ingredients in order to
[1:12:12] make it right you must use all the
[1:12:15] ingredients you want to see Christ in
[1:12:19] you you got to go the provided way you
[1:12:23] got to be justified you got to be
[1:12:24] sanctified you got to be filled with the
[1:12:26] Holy Ghost and God Himself was being
[1:12:28] stepping to your Tabernacle then you are
[1:12:32] truly adopted son manifested among the
[1:12:36] people y'all hear what I'm saying but
[1:12:44] when he came with the discernment and
[1:12:45] everything guess what people said just
[1:12:47] like they said to Jesus that's Beelzebub
[1:12:50] that's witchcraft he's reading the minds
[1:12:54] of the people
[1:12:55] yeah the same thing but elected caught
[1:13:00] it to them it was an Eagles cry y'all
[1:13:05] hear what I'm saying
[1:13:06] now I'm trying to tell us something I'm
[1:13:08] gonna be much longer because I'm trying
[1:13:10] to say the mark of the beast the only
[1:13:13] one thing that protects you is your
[1:13:15] election that's the only thing we don't
[1:13:20] even know why we won't bow down to other
[1:13:22] things because it's Christ in us right
[1:13:26] you look at Daniel we're not gonna bow
[1:13:30] you look at the Hebrew boys we're not
[1:13:33] gonna bow now our prophet came and told
[1:13:36] us that the image that was raised up in
[1:13:38] Nebuchadnezzar that day was the image of
[1:13:41] the prophet Daniel himself and Daniel
[1:13:44] would not even bow to the image so why
[1:13:48] are we bowing revelations amen when it
[1:13:51] with me when John fell down to bow down
[1:13:54] to the ages that get up from there and
[1:13:56] worship God oh I'm like a brother I'm
[1:14:00] just your brother hallelujah
[1:14:03] only God amen his honor of worship y'all
[1:14:10] know what I'm saying in that right you
[1:14:13] heard me say this the other day and I'm
[1:14:14] gonna say it again
[1:14:15] even when the rich young ruler came to
[1:14:17] Jesus a good master Jesus stopped him he
[1:14:24] said why call it me good there's only
[1:14:28] one good and that's God see the man
[1:14:31] himself see he's the word corrects
[1:14:35] hallelujah jesus said I came to nothing
[1:14:38] except the father show me I'm not
[1:14:40] preaching to gods I'm preaching 1 I'm
[1:14:43] preaching out of Matthew I'm in st. John
[1:14:45] 17 father I would that they be one even
[1:14:48] as we are one and you must come and ask
[1:14:51] God what is this oneness because without
[1:14:54] that you won't know your potential you
[1:14:56] won't know where you can go you got to
[1:14:58] see that that oneness is God what God
[1:15:00] desire to have with you is that right
[1:15:05] even God Jesus said listen to the Lord
[1:15:08] the Lord
[1:15:09] loves us just like he loved Jesus whoo
[1:15:11] that's right you know why because we are
[1:15:15] his body you know I must say this I left
[1:15:29] this out but let me say you know how big
[1:15:32] is one of our biggest enemies is is rock
[1:15:35] and roll now I don't know what real rock
[1:15:38] and roll we are somebody gonna have to
[1:15:39] educate me but but I do know that it is
[1:15:44] one of those things that Satan uses
[1:15:45] often to deceive people and and and and
[1:15:50] the devil doesn't care if you use Jesus
[1:15:53] name in it because he knows you your
[1:15:57] high breeding somebody help me here in
[1:16:01] the message and fallible proof he says
[1:16:05] now Jesus will not come into your
[1:16:07] presence when you're carrying on with
[1:16:10] your rock and roll in boogie-woogie and
[1:16:12] all that stuff there I don't care what
[1:16:16] church you belong to Jesus don't come
[1:16:19] into those conversations he don't dwell
[1:16:22] among those kind of things so change
[1:16:26] your conversation if you want to see him
[1:16:28] do as they did meditate on him
[1:16:32] let your conversations be upon him and
[1:16:35] his resurrection for he has risen from
[1:16:39] the dead now he said oh brother why are
[1:16:42] you saying that because I want you
[1:16:44] understand that's what King never never
[1:16:46] could never said if you bow down to the
[1:16:48] it to the music you must bow when the
[1:16:52] trumpets and everything sounds right
[1:16:54] Satan was the the the the main person
[1:16:58] over the music of heaven so he knows
[1:17:01] what God likes and he knows what God
[1:17:03] doesn't like he knows how to pervert it
[1:17:07] hallelujah hallelujah that's why when we
[1:17:10] sing we want God to come on the scene
[1:17:14] hallelujah is that right so you look at
[1:17:17] this and you say well brother what are
[1:17:18] you trying to say let me say it like
[1:17:20] this hey man
[1:17:23] tried to mark the Jews did he not but
[1:17:29] you see those Jews had something Haman
[1:17:31] didn't know about
[1:17:32] they had a covenant God had already told
[1:17:36] them as long as you be be obedient to
[1:17:40] the Babylonians I'll preserve you yeah
[1:17:45] Jeremiah told him that said now but when
[1:17:49] you go up there messing up and acting up
[1:17:51] like you're not gonna be obedient I'll
[1:17:52] let you be destroyed but if you obedient
[1:17:56] I'll be with you and those Jews were
[1:18:00] obedient and and you said well what were
[1:18:05] you but there was an Esther and Haman
[1:18:12] really didn't start acting up until
[1:18:14] yesterday mean seemed like his his his
[1:18:18] hatred for Jews became more intense
[1:18:22] don't you understand and to the Queen
[1:18:26] was made manifest when the devil Haman
[1:18:29] realized she's queen now he didn't know
[1:18:32] it was Esther he didn't know but he
[1:18:36] understood that Mordecai represented
[1:18:38] something he did not like he hated him
[1:18:41] who is this Mordecai he's a Jew he's not
[1:18:45] going bow to you Haman you understand me
[1:18:47] see and that's frustrated the devil the
[1:18:52] devil get frustrated when he find out
[1:18:54] that you will not bow to him he gets
[1:18:57] really angry when he brings a new
[1:18:59] doctrine right that's off the word and
[1:19:03] you won't bow he gets angry with you
[1:19:06] when you see Jesus Christ only oh yeah
[1:19:11] you're a real deal you can see he don't
[1:19:15] care if you're blind it can lead you
[1:19:17] into a ditch if you're blind but you
[1:19:20] gotta understand Queen Esther I love
[1:19:23] Esther it means stop and Esther Esther
[1:19:26] is so many ways you can work this but
[1:19:30] the thing I'm trying to get with is this
[1:19:33] s there was a prayer warrior and when
[1:19:36] look at Esther when she said I want you
[1:19:38] to fast I want you to fast three days
[1:19:40] right don't eat bread or water night or
[1:19:43] day and then I'm going to see the king
[1:19:46] it's like something she represented she
[1:19:49] had to die there hell herself
[1:19:50] to resurrect before she could go to see
[1:19:54] the king and she said if I perish let me
[1:19:58] pet you understand me she died to
[1:20:01] herself her life meant nothing
[1:20:03] she didn't care about being a queen she
[1:20:06] cared about her people that's a real
[1:20:09] soldier of the Lord when he cares less
[1:20:12] about himself but more about the people
[1:20:14] of God but you watch those preachers
[1:20:16] listen let me tell you something a
[1:20:18] preacher was made a servant he was not
[1:20:21] made to be served but we got it
[1:20:27] backwards we got it all mixed up he's a
[1:20:31] king among the message somewhere y'all
[1:20:36] understand what I'm saying we got it is
[1:20:38] that right Jesus said come on Peter let
[1:20:41] me wash your feet let me show it how
[1:20:44] it's done
[1:20:44] this is humility this is the way it is I
[1:20:47] must serve you I must be the example of
[1:20:50] serving but now you've got preachers you
[1:20:53] got to carry their books you got to put
[1:20:55] a fan over the end and walk with some
[1:20:57] kind of answer entourage and you got to
[1:21:00] protect them they got to have bodyguards
[1:21:05] it's true it's backwards and yet the
[1:21:10] people cannot see show me at any point
[1:21:14] in time when brother Branham had such a
[1:21:16] thing as dad and he was our example
[1:21:21] Christ in him right but nowadays you
[1:21:25] take the message and you take the
[1:21:27] preachers day and gonna like me about
[1:21:28] whether I don't care you know understand
[1:21:31] but the truth is the truth this ain't no
[1:21:34] time to be deceived you got to know you
[1:21:38] got Jesus about God and you as they do
[1:21:41] it was a Catholic Church that's the
[1:21:43] Nicolaitans spirit that little spirit
[1:21:45] amen they became a doctrine and we carry
[1:21:48] on like we never were
[1:21:49] at the church agent I ever heard it but
[1:21:55] the people become slaves y'all know this
[1:22:00] the truth I have always said if I say
[1:22:02] anything across the pulpit that you
[1:22:04] don't understand that you obligated to
[1:22:06] ask me what it means I don't have a
[1:22:08] problem with that because it's for you
[1:22:11] to learn it's for us to know and what if
[1:22:14] I'm wrong you could help me who you
[1:22:17] could be wrong brothers I can be wrong
[1:22:21] I'm almost done with these thoughts but
[1:22:25] I'm throwing out some things because I
[1:22:26] want you to understand she thought
[1:22:28] because she understood her rights to
[1:22:31] fight even when the King said you know
[1:22:35] his word cannot return back void the
[1:22:38] Jews will be killed and Esther said no
[1:22:42] within herself there's got to be a
[1:22:45] possibility there's got to be a way of
[1:22:47] getting around this all King let me tell
[1:22:51] you something who I love the way she
[1:22:53] worked it though she had three pools
[1:22:55] brother hallelujah and she comes up to
[1:22:59] the king and he reaches out because you
[1:23:02] got to understand Elster would did not
[1:23:04] come before the t king with some
[1:23:05] sackcloth and ashes in stir came before
[1:23:09] the king with that beautiful dress that
[1:23:11] she knew he liked hey that's what I'm
[1:23:16] saying
[1:23:16] you come before God in the garment he
[1:23:20] likes what garment he likes the garment
[1:23:23] of praise that's the best what he likes
[1:23:27] so she entered into the cheese chamber
[1:23:30] evening with the garment of praise and
[1:23:33] she got what she wanted some time y'all
[1:23:36] we act like we don't know what we do it
[1:23:38] but I try to tell people you watch those
[1:23:41] little girls when it comes to their
[1:23:42] daddies they know how to work it
[1:23:47] hallelujah Amen she give him that smile
[1:23:51] and get all up on his lap and all play
[1:23:53] with whatever he's got and then you know
[1:23:59] he knows she wants something
[1:24:01] even if she haven't said what it is
[1:24:03] and he's ready to empty his pocketbook
[1:24:05] out for oh I just want a dollar okay
[1:24:09] honey you could have no imma give you to
[1:24:12] y'all because she know how it works but
[1:24:16] like when we get older we forget you
[1:24:20] want something from God you need to
[1:24:22] learn how to praise him hello he
[1:24:26] inhabits the praise of his people if you
[1:24:29] want so don't come with no sackcloth and
[1:24:32] ashes like you don't have no faith in
[1:24:33] God say it faces and all kind you'd be
[1:24:39] after the Africa like God don't be moved
[1:24:44] by the way you screaming holla God want
[1:24:46] to see your heart am I making sense oh
[1:24:51] lord help us Jesus I'm not trying to say
[1:24:53] they're not times when desperation
[1:24:56] strikes you but when desperation strikes
[1:24:59] you don't have protocol right you don't
[1:25:03] have time to be polite you don't have
[1:25:05] time you know to be nice there's
[1:25:07] something in your heart and your mind
[1:25:08] and you're going after it right let me
[1:25:14] close in just a moment what I'm trying
[1:25:17] to do with the people I'm trying to show
[1:25:20] that religion is something that has been
[1:25:23] since the Garden of Eden so garden scene
[1:25:25] he's seen plenty of religion you've seen
[1:25:28] religious people probably all the way up
[1:25:31] to here God ain't stirred about your
[1:25:33] religion he won't see change his whole
[1:25:39] purpose is to see his image multiply I
[1:25:44] love it he wants to see his image
[1:25:48] multiply hmm like I said the new world
[1:25:53] is coming and only the new creatures
[1:25:56] will enter into the new world there will
[1:25:59] not be anything that would defile the
[1:26:01] city in the new world there'll be
[1:26:03] nothing there that would make a lie in
[1:26:06] the new world so somehow we must change
[1:26:09] and the only thing only person who can
[1:26:12] change you is God himself because the
[1:26:15] Bible says no man
[1:26:17] and one cubit to his stature so what
[1:26:20] what what happens how do we get there
[1:26:23] the simple method of prayer you have not
[1:26:27] because you ask not and then when you
[1:26:30] ask you must ask in faith because faith
[1:26:34] is the only thing that pleases God you
[1:26:37] love the Lord you said well old brother
[1:26:39] Brooks what about the mark of the beast
[1:26:40] just like I said you and I because of
[1:26:43] this message we we know the devil's
[1:26:46] tactics we know what he's coming with
[1:26:49] and you got to watch what he's doing
[1:26:51] because here try to get you off the
[1:26:53] words but you got to stay on the word
[1:26:55] that is your only protections to stay
[1:26:58] with the word and when you stay with the
[1:27:00] word people ain't gonna like you even
[1:27:02] among this message they don't care for
[1:27:06] you and let me tell you something
[1:27:09] even when you got man that's allowing
[1:27:12] people to just worship them in in that
[1:27:14] simple way they don't even realize it
[1:27:17] because you know what they doing they
[1:27:18] just following tradition see and that's
[1:27:23] why they didn't like Jesus he tore up
[1:27:26] all those Jews traditions
[1:27:29] he taught up how come you won't even
[1:27:33] wash your hands all right how can you be
[1:27:38] eaten like that and in here John and his
[1:27:41] disciples they came and they were faster
[1:27:43] but y'all eatin you are in number
[1:27:45] gluttons how can this be I thought Jesus
[1:27:48] knew he wasn't gonna be ruled by no
[1:27:50] man's Crees dogmas isms or schisms and
[1:27:55] when you become like that you look like
[1:27:57] a rebellious child but you're not
[1:27:58] rebellious see that's why they didn't
[1:28:00] like brother Branham cuz he would tell
[1:28:02] it he tell it just like it is he told
[1:28:05] him what they were doing he told him and
[1:28:07] he basically told him you serpents he
[1:28:10] did he told him basically he said just a
[1:28:13] G just what Jesus said except you
[1:28:16] believe that I am he you should likewise
[1:28:19] die in your sins thank God for believing
[1:28:24] and acting upon that which we believe
[1:28:27] you love the Lord
[1:28:30] I appreciate you I thank you for like I
[1:28:36] said waiting up waiting on me and
[1:28:40] forgive me if I rushed and I did but I
[1:28:44] was just you know I know you you're
[1:28:46] probably tired or but my thing is people
[1:28:50] watch and pray go study are there in
[1:28:56] Jude and I didn't read Jude Jude 1 11
[1:28:59] through 13 16 talks about Dathan and
[1:29:01] Cora and excuse me talks about cane Cora
[1:29:05] and Balaam and and and see what not only
[1:29:08] those words mean but what they did we're
[1:29:12] not talking about the world we taught my
[1:29:13] religious spirits that's working in the
[1:29:16] realm of the message Church now we know
[1:29:20] you said what about later they'd already
[1:29:22] done indeed God then left that they have
[1:29:28] been bundled just a burn now we're in
[1:29:31] the bride age the age of adoption and do
[1:29:36] you think that the devil is going to let
[1:29:39] you build your wall do you think he's
[1:29:42] gonna let God just build this perfect
[1:29:45] statue of Christ without interfering
[1:29:48] they wouldn't even let Israel or build
[1:29:51] the wall some ballot and all the rest on
[1:29:55] me men came against Israel so much so
[1:29:59] they had to have a scalpel and running
[1:30:01] and a sword in the other and I'm gonna
[1:30:03] tell you what you gotta fight for every
[1:30:05] inch of this territory to Jesus calm but
[1:30:09] it's worth the battle it's worth the
[1:30:11] battle lest and there are some things I
[1:30:19] may not know there are some places and I
[1:30:31] cannot go
[1:30:36] but there's one my god is real I can't
