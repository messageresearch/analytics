for the kingdom of god we must always remember that that everything we do is done for the kingdom of god as we stand let us turn to romans the 8th chapter romans 8. from romans 8 we'll ask that you would turn with us to uh proverbs 18 21 romans 8 and 2. let's just start at the first verse there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death proverbs 18 21. have a brother we forgot to pray for his name his last name is thunderbird he was in a car accident he was in a collision he's a young man and uh he's in icu and he's still irresponsive uh he was a member of my church when i pastored in lyme ohio uh so once we're done with this particular scripture we'll just bow in a word of prayer for him again proverbs 18 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof let us pray father we pray that you bless the reading of the word and we pray father god that you were quicken it as the spirit would into our hearts that we'll fully understand what is being said here also lord we pray that you would bless our brother found the bird lord that you would give him a speedy recovery i heard that he's come stable now lord jesus and we're happy about that but father you know him lord you know him better than we know him and you know him better than he knows himself but i pray that your grace and your mercy would be him lord and that you would be with him lord and that you would raise him up again let it be your will lord let thy will be done in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i've been thinking so much about things and when we were in new jersey we ministered this particular message and since then god has been giving me so many more thoughts on where we're headed a lot of times people think that we came into the world to be just people of chance but we're not creature of chance we are creatures that have been well planned and thought about so much so that god was able to predestinate us to be sons and daughters of god we were created for divine purpose and if you would fall into genesis you'll find out that god in his mastermind was the one who told uh spoke to the animals and and spoke to adam and eve to replenish the earth to to uh be fruitful and multiply but i think sometimes we think when it comes to christianity we think that we're supposed to be as brother brenham said patched up that a patched up christian won't make the rapture uh it's what god you say well brother books why would you say that uh and just bear with me in a moment when we when we think about uh a new world and that justification and how only those who were justified was able to cross over and that was eight souls which was noah's in noah's day and for those who were uh in egypt who came out of egypt see something had to change though there were millions of them the bible said joshua and caleb out of that generation was the only one that had new spirits see that god wasn't just calling them out of egypt just to be a good friend or good leader or just prove to him to them that he could be a great shepherd but he has something in his mind and everything is it's a building block it's something that god starts off with and he continue to build and build and build and what is the crooks of it all what is the pinnacle of what god is bringing us to it has to be something better than this life and if god is going to prepare a place if he's going to do a great work and start a new world with the world that he's going to start or begin it's not going to be like this one the bible says flesh and blood can't enter into the kingdom of god and that's a fact and you and i must understand that the message didn't come to make us another another organization or denomination it came to do something you've heard me say many times that i i desire to be changed and i didn't even understand the pool of god or my life at the time uh but within this last year or so i've had a great pool of my life to of change and you know uh the thing is you know and i know it's just uh the little foxes are the thing that spoil the vine i mean we can all look good on the outside but my question is how are you on the inside you and i must understand also that if god is creating i think about the dimension in which which um paul went into and he he called it the third heaven but in reality he'd never been there so you know he had he could only speak according to his knowledge and his understanding where he was and then brother branham comes around and says it's not as great as far away as we think it is he said it's a dimension those dimensions in which uh they speed up faster than what we're living in they're faster than what we're living in and so we find out and he said one day science is going to find out that they're going around in circles and they they're dealing with a bending in in in space or whatever you call it but he said it's not far off i mean matter of fact he said you know it's a dimensional thing that's really passing through this this this this dimension like like radio waves and you know a lot of times we we think that things are far off when they're not even the word of god the bible said it's not in the heavens and all of these places he says nadi even in your mouth so we understand by god's grace amen that what god is doing he's creating something that's similar but beyond this the beginning of adam for an example the first adam amen was an amateur god and of course he was in his theophany as well but adam after falling could not produce that kind of a man ever again and so it took another adam to come and we know that when god made adam he made him male and female he made them both male agenda and female agenda those two were one and so we understand that if that be the case then the second adam must be doing the same thing the second adam we know is jesus christ and and we know that if that be the case that it must be bone of his bone in flesh of his flesh one of the things that always caught my attention was that jesus himself said that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and so i thought well when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time there was millions of people there that was living but there wasn't feasting on the natural bread matter of fact he said they didn't eat there but yet they were living they were able you were able to touch them and to feel them and it was another world something that we cannot comprehend it's almost like uh john the revelator when he was caught up into heaven and he saw the things that he saw but he didn't know what a bomb was he didn't know what a helicopter was he didn't know what airplanes were were he didn't know what they were he didn't understand those things so he could only explain it in the way that he saw it that's why the bible said that the the scripture as it is he said the letter killeth but the spirit gives life god has to bring revelation to us to understand what it's all about i mean it's like it's like john and somehow god works people's personalities and the things that that he wants them to do like luke who was a physician you know like you know uh and and the rest of the apostles and we thought without in the old testament when you saw the four living creatures you saw four living creatures but they were not just creatures they were anointings that anointed men you know uh it's it's like matthew who was who was the lion the king right and mark was the ox who was a a sacrifice and you watch those books as they uh open up and and go on that's how they saw jesus christ and john was the eagle because john saw jesus christ as being god in the beginning was the word the word was with god and where it was god and so those same beasts he said those four living creatures are the very creatures spirits that block the the unbeliever away from the book of acts because a lot of times if you can't get through the four gospels you'll never understand the book of acts i said this to say to go on to say oftentimes we read the book of revelation and i i i i wondered and thought well why did god use john and john was a young perhaps the youngest of the disciples and the bible said he laid in his bosom and john was a type of the bride and so in order to get the mysteries of god and understand secrets that others won't come to know you must lay in the bosom of jesus christ it's just the way it is we can't be carnal christians and be about ourselves but one thing john desired more than anything was to be as close to jesus as as he possibly could be so is the bride of jesus christ is that thirst in her her desire is to lay in his bosom both day and night if possible we must always remember that this age in which we're living in is a age of gathering and it's an age of separation the wheat is being gathered unto the lord and the terror is being bundled and bound to for burning and so the gathering is where is the gathering the bible says wheresoever the caucus is that's where the eagles will be gathered and understand that we're not gathering to a legalistic form of a system we don't have to imitate the what they did in pentecost or what they did in the luther age or the day of the western age we're seed and our our manifestation of god is god i got excited on that one but it's true our manifestation see it doesn't matter we've seen the gifts and all of those things are good i would dare not try to take it away from anybody but that's not the ultimate goal for the bride of jesus christ she must become word and that word must become flesh in her yeah because that's what it was about the second adam that's what made jesus christ different from all because he was the first man that god fully occupied our bodies and he was the first of his kind where god became flesh and he was the first fruit of his kind meaning that there were more to come after after him think about it even in this day god did such a miraculous thing and he brought forth a prophet who didn't even have an education and and he manifested himself in such a way that people thought he was the messiah now he himself wasn't the messiah but the anointing of the messiah was on him only because the scripture said it would be and you and i must understand that the bride amen must be messiahs now think about this because after the third war and i i often wonder like how did it how did they survive but there will be people who will survive because there comes a millennium but where i did not see is that after the millennium the this world goes to a full baptism where everything explodes everything is destroyed that means that the new world to come will be nothing like this one you understand me so all and remember now it won't be another creation where god have to create another adam and another eve god is creating his if i could say he miss eve miss adam now right because the first adam his wife took her his name and the second adam takes the name of his her husband which is jesus christ you understand me so the the world that we're we're god is bringing us into through this uh translation and and how can i say it's like what jesus did on mount transfiguration it was it was different the bible said he was it was so much god there and so much glory there his face shone and and then here's jesus saying in saint john that's why you have to read saint john to understand the book of revelation because you got to catch the way john is thinking and why the way he was inspired about jesus he was the one who really saw jesus christ as being god and so even in the book of revelation you're going to understand that that's the theme of the whole bible jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the one who is which was and the one is to come right so he's the past the present and the future the first and the last and that's the way john saw him not like not like he saw different gods he saw the same god one god now i say all of that to say this the world that we came into after the flood it was just a justification it was just a washing but water can't thoroughly cleanse you and so therefore it brought sin over but the world to come would be a fire baptism no sin will enter no demon will survive it everything will explode and burn and go back to what it was before it ever was so if that be the case this is why uh it's important that we not only experience like i said the other day the holy ghost but the holy ghost and fire where god burns away all the demons away from our lives that's what he said jesus said you either make the tree good or you make it evil you can't have a mixed tree in the new world there won't be a tree of knowledge of good and evil won't be there the only tree that remains is the tree of life which is jesus christ so god amen by his mercy and grace is now forming and shaping us this is why it's important to let go and let god we we must surrender to him listen we don't know how to die we don't know how to rock but we know how to pray and the bible says whatsoever you ask in his name believing that you shall receive it will be given unto you the things that we must not forget is that we are in the age of the gathering as i said and the eagles are gathering around the bleeding word of god knowing one thing that the book is open and understand when when we say the book is open that means god has no seals on him now and anything that the bride need to know and understand amen he will reveal it to it because the book is open you understand me you say well what book the book he is the book he is the word and so he's opening up the word so that we can understand what his desires are for us hallelujah the power of revelation is amazing and that's the thing when you like revelation you you you fail god we all do we come short we find ourselves wavering when we lack the revelation of who we really are and most of all our purpose because remember amen samson was called to a purpose but samson amen he he began to drift because he allowed the world you know we call a delilah but allowed the world to to to take away the life out of him and did not jesus tell us he said the cares of this life would choke the life out of the cares of this world would choke the life out of us it's real it's another delilah in another another form or shape but it's the same spirit that was on her that pulls samson into chaos and you and i must understand this is a battle that we must press god ain't playing he said many other broad is the way that lead to destruction but narrowing straight is the way that leads to eternal life and he says only abuse a few be that find it so it doesn't come to you you must find it amen it's like the woman mary when she heard about jesus being at simon's house she desired something and she was able to die to her own will and embarrassment and she went down to simon's house and she could care less what people thought about her she had an appointment she had a mission and she wasn't going to stop until she accomplished that mission and that mission was jesus christ himself can i say something to you and i'm jumping way ahead of my message but the manifestation of this message is jesus christ in you it ain't nothing else and you say well what do you mean jesus christ that's exactly what it says the manifestation of this message is not a lutheran manifestation it's not a wesley manifestation it's not a pentecostal manifestation and see that's what happens to us if we're not careful we're finding ourselves becoming complacent because things are not moving forward and so we look back as if their way was the right way their way was not the right way that was the way of the shock we're not shocked we've never been this way before we haven't gone this way before people i'm telling you and i'ma tell you like this amen you and i must try to find out from god personally i can't teach you these things because really it's a revelation from god you've got to know that this is a different age and the way god is trying to direct us is different from where we came from amen it has to be that way right because you find out that the westerners was different from the lutherans and the pentecostals were different from the wesleyans and there is no way once you became a pentecostal you was going to go back to the wesleyan ways so is it with the message it has to be different i don't mean different by way of being dead i mean different by way of life because the life left the shock and it's supposed to be in the seed and if we're going to be the seed then we must manifest the life which is jesus christ the power of the revelation is that when god quickens and that's what happened amen when it came to samson he forgot and maybe some of us are in that state of mind right now where we have forgotten what we've been called to do and i'm gonna tell you something there's so many distractions in this world that if you're not careful if you're not prayerful if you're not uh pushing into consecration satan will trap you and snare you like you know with the blink of an eye be the god that that you are that's what i said in my notes be the god that you are right i mean you've got hollywood stars thinking they're gods they're being worshiped for the nonsense that they're doing right but where is the god of elijah in this message the absolute truth is that we are allowed ourselves to be succumbed by the trickeries of the enemies of laodicea and we're failing to see that this world coming will not allow any of this stuff to enter in so if you die you say oh brother people say well you're going to always be sinful but no no no no see that's the wrong attitude we supposed to strive for perfection paul said i pressed toward a mock of a high calling with it's in christ right jesus now we know by god's grace with all oppression i'm pressing right now harder now than i ever have been in my entire life because i'm seeing more little things that are not right about me and i want those things out of my life and i know god is more than able to do it because he promised it he and i talk to god when i talk to him i bring that same scripture he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it he sees the vision he's the only one that can mold and make us into that image that he sees we don't know what that is we don't know we said we believe in jesus christ we know he's real he's in us but we don't know really what that is it's still a mystery we know he helps us when we in time of need we know that he talks to us amen and you know when we when we need comforting we know he's always there but we still don't know what it is we know he's god but when it comes to his substance when it comes to his full makeup listen let me tell you like this a lot of us say well i got the holy ghost but let me tell you but you just got a little piece of it and you and i cannot imagine what heaven is going to be like we don't know what holiness is we don't even know what perfection is but we know who perfection is we know who holiness is and we need him inside of us to create the atmosphere that we would change i don't know whether i said this the last time i was preaching but i think about the process in which we're going through now because a lot of people don't believe it's a process but it's a real process and you know abraham and sarah wasn't changed overnight as they went on their way something took place the word that had been spoken to them by the angel began to molecularly change them and so much so it changed their dna so much soul in there the bible said this is the way bible the hebrew says sarah receives strength well sarah received a new creation she was created amen in a in a new way so that she could produce a baby hello so was abraham and and and and you know you you and i must understand him and if that be the case and brother branham tried to tell us in ways you know how you know different days cheryl looked at abraham and said abraham that hump in your back is straightened up a little bit boy you're looking good you know he went on just talked about talk about how the the the wrinkles and things began to to to change and after a while he saw a beautiful woman called sarah almost a hundred years old and they go down into egypt and and and and and uh abraham said sarah tell this king that you're my sister because he'll look at you and see how beautiful you are and he'll kill me just to get you surely she wasn't an old grandma but to so that you understand the change had to come before the son you understand me whatever change that was whatever god did and remember it was a secret because god told abraham and sarah i'm going to visit you according to the time of life then from that point on it was no longer abraham it was god dealing with sarah she was the one that brought forth which was a type of the church that brought forth the promised son which brother branham types it out as being jesus christ so you and i must understand amen this change you got to let the change come let it come lord no matter what i got to go through if i have to suffer if i got to go through pain if i got to go through trials whatever it's going to take for me to die and rot out so let it be i want that life there is no other life beside your life and then god comes along and he tries to give us our identity he tries to let us know that you know he says it i knew you before the foundation of the world you were with me he says you are my disciples i know you and then he goes along and tried to give them power even before they were converted they had the power to cast out devils right because they would see it was the authority of the word that was in them that's why he says oh ye of little faith where did you doubt and you and i must understand that we're coming to the age of the headship that means the word must be the control tower of our lives it must be the control it must control you as paul says i'm a prisoner of christ you must become a prisoner to the word that word itself is jesus christ you got to have faith as our brother uh greece grizzly gradually griezly came and greely came in and said you've got to have faith in the words that you speak see the prophet god says amen the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer that's why i can't understand that sometimes we sit in church and everybody look like they just you know uh a bump of the log or something or not on a frog however you want to say it but you can preach it preach it preach it but there is no emotion it's just like it's become this mind thing and and you fail you fail to see that god has not come to tickle your mind he came to change you for the power is that right because this bread this word came from the shekinah glory and when you enter the shekinah it wasn't the little room that had the power it's the presence of god that was in there that had the power the word itself so the power of wine the natural wine is to stimulate to bring a person that that's all slumped down and and to stimulate see then now there's a power of the revelation of the word that gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of revelation of satisfaction satisfaction the the stimulation that it vindicates it proved now what is vindication every single christian need to be vindicated and that vindication is to bring you to a place where there is no doubt there is no doubt is that mine or what but anyhow we realize by god's grace amen that when god vindicates you as a christian it's not because you wear a shirt that says jesus is savior or jesus is lord or you got a cap on your head nothing wrong with those things but that doesn't vindicate you as a christian it's the life you live it's the love you bring it's the compassion that you have for your neighbor as well as your enemy those are the things that we know is is is no longer barely in existence you say well what do you mean let me say it like this when the world got so violent in the days of noah only eight souls it was at that time when violence controlled the world god made the exodus and right now we see that violence is controlling the world not just in america it's everywhere and because of that we know we've seen the investigating angels just like in the days of noah and they've gone back to with the report it's as wicked as it was as in noah's day and guess what as wicked as it was in sodom's day and guess what god will have to destroy us too if he destroyed them because of their wickedness he's going to destroy this world because of their wickedness so i'll say all of these things let's move on so the word is supposed to stimulate you but what happens and what happened to us we mixed it just like the pentecostal that anointing we mixed it with hollywood when you mix it with hollywood you lose the effect of what god is trying to do and we we're guilty a lot of preachers want to see the people shout and jump and all that stuff nothing's wrong with it but after all the jumping and shouting what did he say and did it bring a change to your life see what's the use of coming to church like let's say we're walking in behind the veil in this place because god is here and you can go into the shekinah glory and not be changed no you can't come in carnal you can't come in dirty you can't come in filthy and expect god to change you except you repent that's right you are the outward control you you you are you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses you are in an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith you know faith is from another world the faith i'm talking about is is god himself by faith god created the heavens and the earth you know god didn't use this as faith so god used that no he used himself he spoke it and believed his word and that was faith you are an inward man controlled by one sin which is faith and this faith disagrees with all senses if sin six senses doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the sixth sense agree with the faith that faith wonderful but when the six senses disagree with faith then leave the six senses alone oh we need a lesson in that we'll see things we feel things you know like i said the other day the lord really blessed and i went and got my uh uh i examined on a nation on tuesday and and and they were so impressed i was too especially when he said you know there's no more leakage in the back of my eye i'm like god you always do it right and listen because i got the cataract move removed did not mean that the leakage was going to stop but they couldn't find no leakage and i'll be honest with you i see better now than i ever have i believe and they were impressed with me looking through that thing and you know being able to see as much as i did of course something they're going to give me i don't know what that is but it doesn't matter whether i have glasses or not i can still see i can still read and you know the thing about it is there was no pain i would i i expected god to to to do a miracle you know i was looking for a miracle you know that god was before they got to it he goes there is no cataract well it didn't work that way but he still healed me see he makes all things beautiful in his time it's the way he does it it's the way he wants to do with it but it doesn't stop us from believing his what we consider his perfect way right but what is god's perfect way that's the thing some he spoke and they were healed some he took took uh a mud and you know clay and rubbed in the eyes spitter and he what's god's perfect way his perfect way is always his will his will is his perfect way see now for instance jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that that's true the outside man reason that it can be true to can't be true to you then ignore that outside man and accept the inside man now that's something else right so you got to understand that after a while that that bad man's got to die that like i said you know there won't be a tree of knowledge of good and evil over there only one tree which is a tree of life so therefore amen you say what do you mean read your bible you and i supposed to become the tree of life miss jesus christ it's the tree of life god in you the hope of glory see but i told somebody i said you know intellectual being an intellect doesn't mean you had to graduate from harvard or yale an intellectual is anybody whether you've never gone to school before in your life but you have the power to reason that's what makes you an intellectual because you allow your reasoning to cast the word of god down we don't we we you know the bible said you know that we we cast down every imagination but when you allow your imagination to cast a word down that's what you call reasoning for a long time i thought you had to have a degree to be an intellectual but i've seen a lot of smart people who've never had in the schooling and and they don't want to have nothing to do with jesus christ and what does that make them well if god was real why he allowed this to happen y'all know how they do oh lord have mercy these people people are foolish let me move on listen romans 4 17 i'm not going to be too much longer romans 4 17. god is good to us as it is written i have made the father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead y'all get that because i thought you know quickening the dead means that you you're lifeless in your body but the bible says if a woman lives in pleasure she's dead already and it takes god to quicken her right remember at the well when that woman at the well came to jesus she was dead but when jesus finished she had been quickened unto life she was quickened like abraham you know before he we knew god he was dead but god quick listen he was among heathens with all kinds of idols but god quickened him though he couldn't see him he came to believe that this person that quickened him was god had to be in a revelation because abraham left all of his kindred to follow this invisible god and everybody thought he was crazy but let me tell you something that's what makes it real when god quickens you that word to you that your bride you can't explain it you don't know how it's going to happen and everybody looking at you like you're strange because you are but you understand you've been quick and you got something nobody else has you said what do you mean that's why so many people were able to leave the message they never were quicken to the truth of it it was almost like the 70 that followed jesus they never understood who they were following and jesus said many of them followed him only for the fish and the loaves see and that's the same thing a lot of people follow this message for the revelation not not for not for the intimacy that they could have with christ god who quickened the dead and called those things being that be not as though they were see that's how when you come to realize who you are you come to you you stop all the negative talking you stop all the oh you got to start speaking positive because your words mean something that's why i said you know death let me read that that that uh scripture again proverbs says death and life are in the power of the tongue and james says likewise too he said if you came bright or the tongue your religion is in vain you don't have a covering watch that man get angry and go shooting off at the mouth people gonna say well i thought he was a christian see they could be the worst sinner in the world but they know the way a christian ought to behave and you and i must understand by god's grace we have created powers within us nothing it's not your liver your heart your global bladder whatever you got in there and you know what most of us just believe is there because you've never seen it but it's more than that this is the whole mystery of it that god in an age like this could come down and tabernacle himself in men and women who were born sinners headed for hell but god created a new creation on the inside and we're not done yet hmm people don't understand this like i was saying the other day i said a lot of times i was taught and believed that when the resurrection came you know when jesus rose from the dead the graves were open no that ain't scripture the bible said when he died the graves were open but the movies got us believing that the graves were open when he when he resurrected they were already up is that the truth when he gave up the last breath the bible said the temple was rent and dwayne and the graves were open but because of what we believe we received it i'm saying this to say a lot of things well because you've got to understand there's been a second crucifixion god is doing something that people don't even see and cannot see but maybe that's in the next lesson but anyway when it comes to being coming to a place that you and i let me ask you a question how can you be in heavenly places in christ jesus first of all you've got to pass from death into life when does that happen the bible said when you confess jesus christ as your savior when you accept the lord jesus christ in your heart he said at that moment you passed from death in the life he said and at that moment rivers of living waters will flow out of you if it's real that's where the quickening comes because you're no longer a sinner you have automatically become a saint but what's the mystery you look the same nothing changed about your face you know now for me i changed a lot on the out on the outside but things change your your wardrobe or whatever you wear changes from the worldly aspect to something more holy and wholesome it happens and nobody has to make you do it and there's they don't need no laws remember when the holy ghost fell in africa and those native native women was out there naked as soon as the holy ghost fell on them they ran and got blankets and clothing to put on themselves see there are certain things the holy ghost automatically teaches you you don't need a textbook for it amen two worlds from the world of the dead to the world of the living that's what we became we began to live in a different dimension we began to say god said god told me the lord spoke to me and people looking at you crazy because they don't even believe in god and secondly they don't believe that god has the ability to talk to you and when you say well god told me to do this and god led me to do this you know it's a different world they don't even understand what you're talking about because they can't see they're living in a blindness they can't see they can't comprehend us like we can't comprehend them we've changed behaviors i feel and i see see we are the word born of another dimension it is the seventh dimension that is pulling us into it we're being transformed is right we're being transformed and that's what brother branham preached being transformed by the renewing of what your mind transformation is being is happening right now and god will bring us to a translation and a transfiguration he's going to bring us to those things but translation must first come by the renewing of your mind amen let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with god and that's where we has to be quickened because this is the importance of the divine nature in you it's not a choice it's like a lamb having a choice of whether it want to be a goat you know like what they're doing nowadays they ask that lady to find you know can you define a woman she says no i'm not a biologist if that ain't pure ignorance if that ain't being totally blind and that you know what people that's being willfully blind and if she get the judge if she goes into supreme court do you know it'll be like oh my god i said you know i i was and this is this is what we don't understand is that laws laws are the thing it's the thing it's the thing that keep the demons a base once you lose the laws they become free you understand me uh when when when the uh the demons out of river euphrates when they went to hollywood they gradually changed the laws in order for them to have their liberty that's what you're seeing now you know it was it was like uh even you know how they changed laws in daniel's day and you know whenever you change the law and you change it toward the evil it becomes so infested because the devils are there already they just need the freedom to do what they want to do and you and i must understand what's happening here if people don't i'm telling you people do not see and understand they say well i'm bride don't you know the pentecostal said the same every church aide had that move where they thought they were the chosen ones and it doesn't matter oh lord let me say it like this god this is what what makes it so wonderful because god has graciously called us to this message but the message is not a letter it's a revelation is that the truth because brother branham said it like this he said if i talk to him if i wrote a letter to my wife and i wrote i'll write it in a certain way now somebody else reading that letter wouldn't understand what i'm saying but because she knows me y'all hear me because you know him you know exactly what he means when he says certain things he said you got to read between the lines and when he's singing that read between the lines he's working with revelation you need revelation to understand the hour that we're living in is any time to fuss there's no time to fight right i don't have time for it this is harvest time how are you going to change somebody who's a wheat a tear into a wheat the nature of people are being seen and there is nothing you can do about it but other than preach the word people are going to be what they're going to be all like i'm i'm hoping by god's grace that if you have a desire to serve god with the fullness of your heart that you're lean to that and and keep knocking on his door until you get exactly what you want don't let the lord rest and and people of god i know you feel that pool i know you feel that that thing that's trying to bind you and keep you in that certain place but i'm telling you the truth the bible said god knows how to break the foul of snare he knows how to break you out of that hole that you that the devil got you in see we're not listen this is what i'm saying and i got to hurry up let me read this quote so i this is the main thing and this is what i want to read because i can finish this at another time okay we know john type the bride and you and i must we know this these things but let me let me let me read this one quote i want to give you quickly you love the lord because i don't want time to run out on me here comes amen out of the message of identification this is one and i got another one too and his character was that he did everything that pleased god and he stayed with the word that's what he wanted us for we'll stay with god's word find our place and then know where we were at stay with his word and think of it we are invited to shape our own character to his hello so i ain't got to do nothing i'm just going to lay here and he's going to do it no no no you've got to do something we are invited to shape our own character to his now we're going to find out what we've done shape our our character his own by his own own spirit then we by him are sons of god just what i've expressed by having his mind in us to shape our character to his his mind let the mind that was in christ be in you if that mind is in you then you see he only did that which please god listen he knowed who he was he came the son of god he know he was to take that place his character had to be that way and then when he having taken his this place he knowed what messiah was required of and he always sought at god to do those things and did nothing until to the father showed him now if you find your place sister don't let me hurt you or brother but you find your place in the word as a christian not what the creed says that down there in the lower cannon father that's going to be destroyed see you fine excuse me you find your place as a christian because your character is molded as christ you are zoe the same as he was zoe then the bible said for a woman not to cut her hair how can you do it it says a man is the ruler of the house how can you women be what's the matter with you man that sons of god see see you don't find your place see you're invited to come and take the character by having his character in you it mows you into the same mind that he was and that mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do the same character that's what it is now there's another quote i've got to find it it's so important that i find this god is good to us you love the lord let me read this one this is not the one i was looking for it says in the new earth that's to come it's to have a holy fire baptism to clean it of every devil every germ every sickness everything that there is and make it anew i saw a new heaven and a new earth and this is let me inject my thoughts on that if it's a new heaven and a new earth it can't be like the old my question is if they didn't breathe there will we breathe because breathing is time it's linked to time before adam was in the flesh he was just eternal but when god put him in this this flesh he breathed in him and he became a living soul but now that you've been in the very image and likeness of god what will it be like now i don't know that question i don't know the answer but i'm just inject i'm throwing that out to you so that you understand that this new creation is new creation of you will be far beyond this it'll be a dimensional being that can move from one dimension to another just by thought it said jesus walked through the door did he the door was there he just moved through dimensions can you imagine he was speeding he was going fast like this and then he just slowed himself down and walked through i don't know how he did it but he did it and that's what we're looking at now you say well what do you mean the bible said that enoch was translated huh and you say oh well what are you saying philip was too but what happened to philip body that he was able to move the way he did in that space and time see that's what we must understand that even in this space and time the word has preeminence over all of that nothing can hinder us elijah the old man outran a chariot see we've got to think like god our minds got to go up higher and understand thinking like christ not like us you understand me it's not because oh i think no no he is god you become a new person he said everything that is and made it a new i saw a new heaven and a new earth you become a new person amen not just an old patched up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit god takes the old man and burns him completely out and the holy ghost and fire and with the holy ghost and fire and comes himself sends down your representation no man can come to me except my father has strong him and all the father has given me will come see but this is not this is one more that might have maybe it's god's way of me doing it the next time we have service but um when i think about uh what god has done must be the will of the lord for me to read it another time but my my thought is to to oh here it is you know how the prophet god said a lot of times people miss god we miss him it's like jonah joan of arc when the catholic church killed her thought and burned her as a witch and then down the road 150 years later they studied her life and studied what she did and then realized she wasn't a witch but she was a saint you know it kind of like what the world did they crucified jesus and then once they crucified him they realized he was the son of god he said the same thing that they'd done to joan of arc the catholic church burned her for a witch because she was spiritual and about 150 years later dug up the body of those priests and throw them in to dupentance it does right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that god predestinated before the foundation of the earth the same thing come through in the days of noah same thing come through in the days of moses days of elijah the days of the prophet the days of jesus on down through and to every hour the pregnant person with the seed of god the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone manifests itself in this person the prison to an individual you understand me did you hear what he said that's where we're supposed to become that's where we're going now not say much church not my my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against the truth but it is the truth now you say oh there is no way this could happen but look what the pentecostal did when it came to this message they fought it they even call it a devil right now what about us those of us who was in this message when we began to strip away all the things we thought was right when we began to strip away the the false interpretation of things and began to see that this is an age that we must renew our minds we must come into that place where we can god can see out of us and we can see him he said you'll know in that day i'm in the father of the fathers of me and i'm in you basically he's saying what in that day we have become one that's what jesus said saint john 10 30. i and my father won jesus prayed in the book of saint john chapter 17 father i would that they be one even as we are one that's the kind of oneness god wants don't look like look at it like it's a hopeless situation it's not he that willeth nor he that runneth it's god who shows mercy you can't do it i can't do it nobody can do it brother branham couldn't do it paul couldn't do it none of us can do it but it's the grace and mercy of god that does it but you know what he says you have not because you asked not jesus said now peter and john and all the rest of the people you've got the revelation now the whole church is saved no it was to him personally i say unto thee not to them to thee thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the word peter means a stone a stone means the confessed one or the separated one upon a certain stone upon a certain thing she called out the church called out upon the stone upon this revelation flesh and blood never revealed it to you but upon this rock this revelation called out group i'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it not one half of your head shall perish you are mine and i'll raise you up in the last day give unto him eternal life and raise him up at the last day there it is the revelation not them but him as an individual not a group an individual all hell against it amen see as individuals that's why you see crazy stuff uh happening in churches the devil allah do those things to discourage you and then he blinds your mind like it's impossible because we always prime with our human effort to be perfect and you're just wasting your time the only way that you and i can make perfection is that god gives it and what is that god in you amen and you'll find him on your knees you find him in your secret closet you find him when you find a personal uh time to get with him and when he comes you got to believe it's him and when he does come and you know he's there what does he do oh he just makes you speak in tongues no that ain't it he makes you shout oh that ain't it you might do all of that but the thing that you'll know for certain is that you've been changed that's all you want change change into his image from glory to glory let's stand i am living from glory to glory since jesus came into my life my soul is clean thank god i've been redeemed since jesus came into my life yes i'm a living from glory to glory from glory to glory from glory to glory oh yes i am living i'm glory to glory [Music] and i've got a story to take how he

has given me a revelation of giving me understanding of where he's taking me brother branham just didn't preach a message that would leave us wondering but he gave us a message of a vision because
