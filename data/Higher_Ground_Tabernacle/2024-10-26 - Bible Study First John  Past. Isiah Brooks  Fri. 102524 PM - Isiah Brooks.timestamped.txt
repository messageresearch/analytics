[0:00] for
[0:57] amen forgot to turn it on
[1:00] amen so as we are here tonight let us
[1:04] turn to First
[1:11] John we start with first John we'll go
[1:15] second third we'll finish this
[1:19] um by the grace of
[1:28] God we we may stand and I'll read first
[1:31] John 1-5 we take these first verses few
[1:35] verses by the grace of
[1:42] God that which was from the beginning
[1:46] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:48] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[1:52] and our hands have handled of the word
[1:55] of
[1:56] life for the life was manifested and was
[2:00] have seen it and bear witness and show
[2:03] unto you that eternal life which was
[2:06] with the father and was manifested unto
[2:09] us that which we have seen and heard
[2:14] declare we unto you that you also may
[2:17] have fellowship with us and truly our
[2:20] fellowship is with the father and with
[2:23] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[2:26] write we unto you that your joy may be
[2:31] full this then is the message which we
[2:35] have heard of him and declare unto you
[2:38] that God is light in him is no Darkness
[2:43] at
[2:48] all sixth verse if we say that we have
[2:51] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[2:54] we lie and do not the truth let us pray
[3:00] our gracious father God we thank you for
[3:02] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[3:04] for your goodness we thank you for the
[3:07] reading of the word we pray that you
[3:09] break the word to us Lord in this day
[3:12] and hour God we need more of you we need
[3:17] all of you Lord we pray that you would
[3:20] fill us with your word anoint us oh God
[3:24] that we would be true Witnesses in this
[3:26] hour in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[3:30] amen you may be seated won't be much
[3:35] long but uh I felt like I was directed
[3:38] to study this and by the grace of God um
[3:44] we know um John is it's beautiful
[3:49] because John is the not only the
[3:51] disciple of Jesus but he's also the
[3:54] young a younger brother and he is a
[3:56] brother a half brother of Jesus Christ
[4:00] and we know John was also one that the
[4:03] scripture they said that he was always
[4:05] in the bosom of Jesus and you know how
[4:09] Brothers do they hug on each other and
[4:11] fellowship with each other but and and
[4:13] Jesus was close to John John also was a
[4:16] type of the Bride the Bride of Jesus
[4:18] Christ so there were things that John
[4:21] encountered with Jesus that the others
[4:23] did not uh encounter and that was that
[4:27] close intimate
[4:28] relationship um um so much so that God
[4:31] chose him and he was one that was
[4:34] translated into our day and that's why I
[4:36] believe in time travel because John
[4:39] definitely had a he traveled in time and
[4:41] he saw all day the beautiful part about
[4:44] this epistle is that he wasn't the
[4:48] gospel didn't come to to disciples by
[4:50] someone else they it was
[4:53] firsthand they they they knew what Jesus
[4:56] looked exact they they knew him they saw
[4:59] him they were able to handle him and
[5:02] that's much more than you know we know
[5:04] him by Spirit the Bible said we don't
[5:06] know him no more after the flesh but
[5:08] after the spirit but can you imagine how
[5:11] that must have been to be able to handle
[5:14] Jesus to touch him to to feel what he
[5:18] felt and to embrace him you know and
[5:22] they they got that PRI and they get that
[5:24] at the end too but you know my my point
[5:27] is to be a witness
[5:30] it's not secondhand information it is
[5:33] something that you say hey I was there
[5:36] you know it's like we used to sing that
[5:39] song you ought to have been there when
[5:41] the Holy Ghost came you know and and and
[5:44] and basically say you you can't tell me
[5:47] it doesn't exist CU I'm a witness that
[5:49] it does he changed me and so here John
[5:53] is not only seeing this man because you
[5:57] got to realize that the revelation of
[5:59] Jesus Christ was
[6:01] Progressive with the disciples they
[6:04] didn't see him they saw him as the
[6:06] Messiah when they when they first met
[6:08] him and how they they knew that much
[6:12] about him was because John was telling
[6:14] them that listen my Ministry is just to
[6:17] is a forerunner of the great one to come
[6:20] and you know can you imagine that you
[6:23] know if John had not pointed him out
[6:26] they would not have known him because he
[6:27] looked like any ordinary you you know
[6:30] what I mean I mean he he wasn't someone
[6:33] that was so goodlooking everybody would
[6:35] turn their head no no no he fed he he he
[6:38] fit right into the regular crowd of
[6:40] people and as we understand he wasn't
[6:43] some tall elegant man he was short you
[6:47] know and you know a short man and um you
[6:51] know so he could get lost in the crowd
[6:54] so you know he did that several time he
[6:56] passed right through the people and they
[6:58] didn't even know him
[7:00] but here John says listen my eyes have
[7:03] seen him and it's amazing because how
[7:06] God word this uh by way of John my eyes
[7:10] we have seen him and we have looked upon
[7:12] him and our hands have handled him of
[7:15] the word of Life Now understand this
[7:19] they had to come to know he was that in
[7:23] all of the course of their being with
[7:24] him three and a half years they saw all
[7:26] the Miracles the miraculous things they
[7:28] had done
[7:30] uh but you know uh the one question
[7:33] Jesus asked him you know whom do you say
[7:36] the son of man am you know and and he he
[7:39] really put that out to all of them and
[7:42] then he said tell me Peter which who who
[7:45] do you say I the son of man am and he
[7:47] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[7:49] Living God and Flesh and Blood hath not
[7:52] revealed this unto you but my Father
[7:55] which is in heaven so I say this too so
[7:58] that you can understand stand by the
[8:00] grace of God your R your your knowing
[8:02] Jesus Christ is by Revelation and your
[8:05] revelation of Jesus Christ must always
[8:08] come back to the word it because the
[8:11] word the Bible said read the scriptures
[8:13] for in them you think you have eternal
[8:16] life and they are they that testify of
[8:19] me in other words they are witness of
[8:22] who I am now but these people you got to
[8:26] understand they were right from the old
[8:29] Testament they uh was of the law and
[8:33] here come Jesus Christ full of grace and
[8:36] truth he spent three and a half
[8:39] years constantly telling these people
[8:43] what Grace and Truth was all about is no
[8:47] longer eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
[8:50] no if if if a man slap you you turn to
[8:53] cheat you know uh do unto others as you
[8:56] would have them do unto me that's what
[8:58] he taught them so you got to understand
[9:01] we're talking about tradition we're
[9:02] talking about long lasting hundreds of
[9:04] years you know these people been killing
[9:06] each other that's why Israel doing what
[9:08] they doing now they still under the eye
[9:10] for an eye and a to for Toth so you got
[9:13] to understand that when Jesus came he
[9:15] was light and and it's
[9:17] like if how can I say it a blind man if
[9:20] a man blind man opens his eyes to light
[9:24] too fast it can become it can be more
[9:27] harmful but Jesus taught them little by
[9:30] little on who he was in order to he was
[9:34] feeding them like babes that's basically
[9:36] what he was doing because spiritually
[9:38] that's what they were and he could have
[9:42] just come up and say hey I am the
[9:44] Messiah but he wanted that Revelation he
[9:48] wanted that to be excuse me a revelation
[9:51] and not not because I told you so he
[9:54] asked Peter he asked the group who do
[9:56] you say that I am the son of man now the
[9:59] word term son of man means Prophet okay
[10:02] so he said now who who is this Prophet
[10:06] right so he's elevating he's literally
[10:08] coming to elevate the revelation of who
[10:11] he is I'm not just a prophet I'm more
[10:15] than a prophet and the only way that
[10:17] you're going to know this is that my
[10:19] father reveals it to you and in other
[10:21] words it's the spirit of the Lord that
[10:24] quickens right not man you can't educate
[10:27] man into Jesus Christ
[10:29] with all the knowledge that he may have
[10:31] without the Holy Ghost he still lays in
[10:34] darkness because he just think he knows
[10:37] right the Holy Ghost is something that's
[10:40] revealed so much into your soul into
[10:42] your heart that you know you know that
[10:45] you know that you know but John I think
[10:48] about them and it's a it's something
[10:51] that we we don't have the experience I
[10:54] mean even God in this last day uh didn't
[10:57] allow us to experience William brandom
[11:01] right one of the greatest prophets on
[11:03] the face of the Earth and he comes along
[11:06] lives and die and all we we have is is
[11:09] is the tapes and the books and most of
[11:12] all we have the Holy Ghost that
[11:14] witnesses to us that that was Christ in
[11:17] his ministry right listen and I heard
[11:21] brother randam say this the other day he
[11:23] said our this church age what we call
[11:25] the bride we will receive the greatest
[11:28] reward of all the church ages
[11:32] amen why because we're believing
[11:35] something that no one else can believe
[11:38] we're seeing something that no one else
[11:41] can see and it's only because you were
[11:43] ordained to to do so right you know you
[11:46] never saw Jesus and I'm coming back to
[11:48] this but you never saw Jesus out there
[11:50] screaming in in the in in the street you
[11:53] know where are my 12
[11:55] disciples no he handpicked everyone one
[11:59] of them right and the unction was on
[12:04] both sides even when he said come follow
[12:07] me they could have said man are you
[12:08] crazy no but they were anointed to
[12:11] follow him and we know it is with the
[12:14] same with us that's how we know we are a
[12:17] witness you know in other words we you
[12:20] know somebody can tell you about the
[12:22] Holy Ghost but when you receive it you
[12:25] know now you know that you know that you
[12:27] know that you know like I was telling
[12:30] somebody saidwell how do you know
[12:32] because the Holy Ghost is not a shout
[12:34] it's not a dance it's not a speak in
[12:35] tongues it may do all of that but it's a
[12:39] change of life amen that's right it
[12:42] changes your life am from the life of
[12:45] Darkness into the life of light all
[12:49] right so listen what is a
[12:52] witness a witness is one that have
[12:55] knowledge of an event or change
[12:59] from personal observation or
[13:03] experience you
[13:05] know that's where gossip comes in let's
[13:09] say this somebody said well you know I
[13:11] was at the basketball game and but you
[13:14] weren't but you should have seen how
[13:17] that that man was put that but if you
[13:20] you weren't there you're going to tell
[13:23] that story like you was there and then
[13:25] somebody going to say were you
[13:27] there but you know what you you wasn't a
[13:29] witness you just took somebody else's
[13:32] experience and that's what a lot of
[13:34] people do as Christian we take somebody
[13:37] else's experience it's like what a lot
[13:39] of people in the message do we take
[13:41] brother brandom's experience and try to
[13:43] apply them to ours but they're not yours
[13:46] you weren't a
[13:48] witness though you believe it a witness
[13:52] must have the same
[13:54] experience you were
[13:57] there right
[13:59] and so when you know that you've been
[14:01] there nobody can take it from you that's
[14:03] right it's like I love the way Brother
[14:05] Rich says
[14:07] it you when you see
[14:10] truth you can't unsee
[14:14] it truth is
[14:16] truth and now you are witness to the
[14:18] truth because something in you says amen
[14:22] and that amen turns into an
[14:25] experience right every Christian should
[14:28] have some some kind of experience and
[14:30] when I say experience doesn't
[14:32] necessarily fall under
[14:35] sensation right experience is something
[14:38] that changes
[14:40] you I have the experience that I have
[14:43] been
[14:45] changed right so you got to understand
[14:47] to be a witness doesn't necessarily mean
[14:51] you're going to be so emotional like
[14:52] everybody else but you're such a witness
[14:56] that is the life is real to you live
[14:59] live it
[15:00] amen it's a living
[15:03] situation right I am a witness I was
[15:07] there you know we always say that you
[15:10] know and and and and and you say what do
[15:13] you mean brother books I was there see
[15:15] some things when I could say it like
[15:17] this when you really believe that you
[15:19] are the bride of Christ and how do you
[15:22] know you
[15:26] are because you had an experience
[15:29] remember the old story about how the
[15:32] Rancher son came to the ranch and all
[15:36] those girls was having a party and and
[15:38] looking to marry the
[15:40] Rancher but those girls in the house
[15:42] never had the
[15:44] experience like the one in the backyard
[15:46] throwing out the
[15:47] water the one out in the backyard
[15:50] throwing out the water he came to her
[15:53] she didn't come to him amen but he he
[15:57] literally saw her and then he approached
[16:00] her from the
[16:02] fence because he was watching her right
[16:06] and you got to understand he calls she's
[16:09] responding nobody can take that
[16:11] experience from her right though she's
[16:14] still dressed in rags though she's still
[16:17] throwing out dish water her position in
[16:19] the house never did change until till he
[16:23] that day of the Rapture amen y'all know
[16:26] what I mean until that day he came and
[16:27] took her away amen but in all of that
[16:32] she still was bride but yet she was a
[16:35] dishwasher still she still was bride
[16:38] though she was being rejected by all the
[16:41] others she still was bride why because
[16:45] she had an experience she was she was a
[16:47] witness if there was no other witness
[16:49] she was the witness and he was the
[16:52] witness that he proposed to her see out
[16:56] of out of the mouth of two witnesses
[16:59] let every word two to three witness let
[17:01] every word be
[17:02] established so when God comes to
[17:06] you you know it now nobody else might
[17:09] not see him you know they may not feel
[17:12] him don't get me wrong I love feelings I
[17:14] love all of that but when you are
[17:17] connected with God you cannot be
[17:20] unconnected amen that's the point it's
[17:24] like a tree standing by the rivers of
[17:26] water I shall not be moved
[17:30] and you go through the storms you go
[17:31] through the battles but there's
[17:33] something that still connects you and
[17:35] what it is is that
[17:37] experience of of connecting with God you
[17:40] are a
[17:42] witness that's why I continually preach
[17:44] the grace of God because you can't you
[17:46] can't go by your own works but you go by
[17:49] the experience the witness that you met
[17:52] him and he's met you you know
[17:55] [Music]
[17:56] him listen
[17:59] let's let's uh uh go here to
[18:06] uh let's read the second verse
[18:09] again for the life was manifested and we
[18:13] have seen it and bear witness right and
[18:17] show unto you that eternal life which
[18:21] was with the father and was
[18:24] manifested unto us now he says I'm a
[18:28] witness now we we we we this life has
[18:31] been manifested unto us amen right
[18:35] meaning I have received the Holy Ghost I
[18:38] have received him and this life is
[18:42] manifested because like Paul said it's
[18:44] not I that live but Christ that lives in
[18:48] us right the Holy Ghost is a
[18:51] manifestation there is no way you could
[18:53] that's why Jesus said don't take the
[18:55] light and put it under a bushel
[18:59] but put it in a place where people can
[19:01] see the light that you'll be a
[19:03] witness right because if you are a
[19:05] witness to me Jesus is saying my Father
[19:09] in heaven will glorify will be glorified
[19:13] by you being a witness to others right
[19:17] because they're going to say oh that
[19:18] person is a Christian I know they're a
[19:20] Christian right so we we when with a
[19:24] life and when I keep saying this because
[19:27] let me say it like this
[19:30] people get salvation mixed up with
[19:33] religion religion is
[19:35] just learning how to do things
[19:39] right you know oh you can say well what
[19:42] do you mean it's just a
[19:44] habit you can say that man go to a
[19:47] Baskin of robins every Thursday
[19:52] religiously it's just a habit you you
[19:54] you learn how to do a certain thing you
[19:57] know and you could be a Buddhist and
[20:00] have
[20:01] religion Muslims are
[20:04] religious because they doing acts that
[20:08] appear to be holy but they're not holy
[20:11] y'all understand me because you can't be
[20:13] holy without the Holy Ghost
[20:15] amen see so all of the outward stuff is
[20:20] basically religion and we find that
[20:23] among ourselves that's right right you
[20:26] can practice to be right you can be
[20:28] religious but Jesus said said except
[20:32] your righteousness exceed the
[20:35] righteousness of the
[20:37] Pharisees you and no wise have a part of
[20:39] me and what was the difference they
[20:43] practice everything right remember the
[20:45] the the Rich Young Ruler God had nothing
[20:48] against him oh the Bible said that even
[20:50] Jesus loved
[20:52] him but he didn't have the
[20:56] experience and because you meet Jesus
[20:59] don't I bump into him don't meet oh I
[21:01] bumped up into him you know there's a
[21:03] lot of people that bumped up into him it
[21:05] was the same ones that's crying out
[21:08] crucifying but then there were those
[21:10] those who were not only bumping but they
[21:12] got a touch like the woman with the
[21:14] issue of blood so she had an
[21:17] experience right it it's like when the
[21:20] when the when the messenger from Jared
[21:23] came to Jesus and said my Lord my my
[21:25] master has a daughter who's sick or son
[21:28] you know yeah but he he said oh well I
[21:31] met him oh no you you you met him but
[21:34] you had to your experience didn't change
[21:38] you but when jarot came and he says
[21:41] listen Lord I I'm a man of of uh
[21:43] authority too I know what when I say to
[21:46] my my servants do this they do that when
[21:49] I say do this they do that and all I
[21:51] need you to do is speak the
[21:54] word so he had a confidence so now he
[21:58] has an
[21:59] experience that the Lord
[22:02] Jesus is a man of authority he is God or
[22:05] the Son of God and all I all he has to
[22:08] do is speak the word amen see that's how
[22:11] the pH I mean excuse me that's how the
[22:13] Gentiles supposed to be if you truly say
[22:16] you God and say Lord speak the
[22:18] word if you really listen faith is a
[22:22] substance it's the holy spirit is God
[22:25] right so you say well what do you mean
[22:27] you know we see the word of God the
[22:29] Bible said by faith God created the
[22:32] heavens and the Earth well God didn't
[22:34] have a wand in his
[22:36] hand the Bible said all things were
[22:39] created who by him so if if it was
[22:42] created by Him He is Faith Jesus Christ
[22:47] is Faith and the Bible said we live by
[22:50] what the faith of
[22:53] God but that's the Holy Spirit and the
[22:56] Holy Spirit can never without his word
[23:00] amen and so that you understand we all
[23:02] live in a three- room house
[23:05] right and is consist of you know the
[23:09] flesh the spirit and the
[23:10] soul and Jesus or the Holy Spirit can be
[23:14] reside on your flesh and cause you to
[23:16] dance and cry and everything it can
[23:19] reside in your spirit cause you to speak
[23:21] in tongues have a great time but the
[23:24] real conversion comes in the
[23:26] soul that's the deepest part of a man
[23:30] and once it comes into the soul it locks
[23:33] the
[23:35] door you understand me you're sealed in
[23:38] there it's locked it locks the door and
[23:40] it can't get out and you can't leave it
[23:42] and he won't leave you and that
[23:46] Soul how can I say it produces life like
[23:50] I read the Scripture it can't be life
[23:52] and
[23:53] death it's got to be
[23:56] life right because that's who Jesus is
[24:02] right so you got to understand by the
[24:04] grace of God in that six verse
[24:07] says if we say that we have fellowship
[24:10] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[24:14] do not the
[24:16] truth so that goes for all of
[24:20] us if you in the spirit and you in the
[24:23] light of God you're going to walk in the
[24:26] light you're going to talk in the light
[24:28] and the Bible said if we walk in the
[24:29] light as he is in the light we have
[24:33] Fellowship one with another and the
[24:35] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[24:37] all our sins amen so what are you saying
[24:40] brother Brooks see he's not a Baptist
[24:42] Jesus Anymore he's not a a uh
[24:44] Pentecostal or Methodist Jesus Anymore
[24:47] he's Jesus Christ the word amen the
[24:50] Bible said his name shall be called the
[24:52] word of God right in the beginning was
[24:55] the word and at the ending is the word
[24:58] amen the alpha has become the
[25:00] Omega right so what are you what what
[25:03] are you saying brother Brooks so we're
[25:05] part of that word
[25:07] amen right you're born with sinful flesh
[25:12] right that means you're going to make
[25:13] mistakes here with all that Holy Ghost
[25:16] because listen everybody has a Measure
[25:18] of
[25:19] Faith everybody in here we don't have
[25:21] the same level of faith and that's no
[25:25] mistake that was God's doing amen right
[25:29] think about his Apostles they all were
[25:31] different and in the midst of all of
[25:33] that you still had D doubting Thomas
[25:36] he's there the chair was already ready
[25:38] for
[25:40] him 12 Thrones is that correct come on
[25:43] somebody come on so you got to realize
[25:45] by the grace of God but one thing for
[25:47] certain he doubting Thomas as we call
[25:50] him he was a powerful
[25:53] witness at least he wasn't no hypocrite
[25:56] that's right you know people say well
[25:57] you should should be asking for signs
[25:59] and you shouldn't be ask well if you
[26:01] sincere amen and you need God to do
[26:04] something for you there's nothing wrong
[26:06] with
[26:07] that Lord I believe he's Lord If he if I
[26:11] can thrust my hand into his side I love
[26:14] that because you take thrust you know
[26:16] we're not talking about gently move it
[26:18] through
[26:20] thrust and Jesus never said ooo that
[26:24] hurt why we had a body
[26:28] that could not feel
[26:31] pain his body was different and that's
[26:34] the kind of body he's promising us amen
[26:38] hallelujah what would a
[26:41] man HHH give for his soul that was the
[26:44] question uh uh that was asked in the
[26:47] book Book of Job what what would a man
[26:49] give you know Jesus said God said go
[26:53] ahead and try him go ahead and try job
[26:55] had had has had enough experiences with
[26:57] me
[26:59] amen I know he'll not leave me amen I
[27:01] know he'll stand with me right now you
[27:04] think about how many H oh we have it
[27:06] hard oh we have it hard none of us have
[27:08] had it hard like
[27:10] Jo and no matter how Jo was tempted and
[27:15] and how job the devil beat him oh I
[27:17] don't know oh my I can't imagine I can't
[27:22] imagine one day everything goes away I
[27:26] lost my children I lost my cat my cows
[27:29] everything everything's
[27:32] gone in one
[27:38] day and job said the lord
[27:41] giveth and the lord taketh away that's
[27:44] when you know you've had a
[27:48] genuine experience with God you
[27:51] know that word this is what I love about
[27:53] it I'll never leave you nor will I
[27:55] forsake you I will always be with you
[27:58] you Proverbs
[28:01] 8 any
[28:03] questions
[28:08] comments
[28:12] amen Proverbs
[28:16] 8 Proverbs 8
[28:22] 27-30 this book is a book of
[28:25] Faith Jesus the Bible said he learned
[28:29] his obedience by way of suffering so a
[28:33] lot of time you suffer in order to learn
[28:35] obedience right when God said don't do
[28:38] it you do it he spanks you and then you
[28:41] learn that's how we that that's that's
[28:44] how we learn all of us learn that way
[28:47] right and I I remember getting a
[28:49] whipping one time it was so bad I never
[28:51] did that thing
[28:52] again so sometimes our our spanking is
[28:56] that our chastisement of the Lord is
[28:58] sometimes more severe at times than in
[29:01] others right so by the grace of God you
[29:06] say well brother books I don't
[29:07] understand that well you know when there
[29:08] was a time we used to get spanked all
[29:10] the time you know what I mean we get
[29:12] that spanking but then when you grow up
[29:14] and you know better a little more better
[29:16] you know what God says well if you if
[29:18] you're not going to do this I'm not
[29:20] going to do
[29:21] that don't we do our kids like that I'm
[29:24] not going to let you get on the with the
[29:27] the iPad or the phone or the what and
[29:29] God is the same way he'll do the same
[29:32] thing in order to get your attention and
[29:35] try he's trying to teach you
[29:38] obedience and that's an experience can I
[29:40] say this by the grace of God we always
[29:43] talk about the Acts of the Apostles or
[29:46] the acts the book of Acts uh writing a a
[29:49] brand new
[29:50] book don't you know that in in the time
[29:54] of Smyrna when they was put uh being
[29:57] persecuted Ed that was a book of
[30:01] Acts people were
[30:04] dying being fed to the
[30:06] Lions and they were holding fast to
[30:09] their faith how many of us could do
[30:13] that they were a
[30:16] witness y'all understand me they were
[30:19] Witnesses of Jesus Christ and the life
[30:22] they possessed it that's all I say Lord
[30:26] just let me possess that where you you
[30:29] you have
[30:30] preeminence not 99%
[30:34] 100% of my life ruling it no matter how
[30:37] ridiculous I might look to someone else
[30:40] come on and you think about it we we we
[30:43] look at the Old Testament but I'm going
[30:44] tell you something those Old Testament
[30:46] Saints had
[30:49] Faith how many of you believe Ezekiel
[30:52] report Ezekiel said the spirit of the
[30:54] Lord Came Upon me lifted me up my by my
[30:56] head my the head of my hair and took me
[30:59] up into
[31:02] heaven it almost sound like a joke but
[31:06] it's
[31:07] reality I mean you know here is Elijah
[31:10] taken up by the chairs of fire you
[31:13] believe that I believe Noah there was a
[31:16] flood I believe the serpent I believe
[31:18] there was a virgin I believe that see
[31:21] what I'm saying so if I believe that why
[31:23] can't I believe the word for my day
[31:28] I want to be a
[31:29] witness and brother Bram tells us that
[31:32] this church will be a supernatural
[31:35] Church omnipotent she have the power of
[31:38] God in her yall understand me and I
[31:42] cannot settle for this
[31:46] mediocre type of
[31:48] religion and that's what it's become
[31:51] with a lot of people acting and doing
[31:53] the right thing cuz religion is just a
[31:56] covering we don't need covering we need
[32:00] change
[32:01] see we're there now I don't mean to
[32:05] preach I get
[32:07] excited sorry about that Proverbs
[32:11] 8:27 through 30 you love the
[32:17] Lord can someone read that for me 27
[32:21] through3
[32:29] of
[33:00] always can you believe that yes
[33:05] sir he talking about Jesus well if he's
[33:07] talking about Jesus he's talking about
[33:09] you
[33:10] too cuz you and I were in him this is
[33:14] the revelation of this message we we
[33:16] can't allow this message to be enaged by
[33:20] time this is message is eternal amen I I
[33:24] can't explain what I'm saying here it is
[33:27] eternal and we have allowed Satan to to
[33:30] to to to to put it in this uh Dimension
[33:33] no that's Church age stuff
[33:37] Amen in in in the bride AE there there's
[33:40] no no fence no wall because it's Eternal
[33:43] it has no beginning no ending the more
[33:46] you want to see the more God will give
[33:48] to you amen that's right the more change
[33:50] you want God will give you the
[33:53] change nothing hinder you so well
[33:55] brother books I've been this I've been
[33:56] that I've done this I've done that
[33:58] that's in your mind but in the mind of
[34:01] God you never did it in the first place
[34:05] and you got to learn how to think like
[34:07] the word says because when the word says
[34:10] s this that and the other you take it
[34:13] and you run with it it there is now no
[34:17] condemnation to those who walk not after
[34:20] the flesh but after the spirit see what
[34:24] I'm saying but we imprison ourselves by
[34:27] our own condemnation our own thoughts
[34:30] about ourselves why should I remember
[34:34] anything I've ever done if I've made
[34:36] right with God if I've confessed it then
[34:38] I'm free all of us are free by way of
[34:42] confession but brother Bram said in
[34:44] which the word says also but if you
[34:46] don't confess your sin you got to
[34:48] confess that don't mean I've got to you
[34:50] know put it in the newspaper but if I've
[34:52] offended someone if I've done wrong if I
[34:55] whatever I've done God knows and I need
[34:58] to make those yeah go down in there and
[35:00] says throw it
[35:02] up it
[35:04] hurts to tell on
[35:07] yourself it does that's one of the
[35:10] hardest things for us to do as if God
[35:12] don't know
[35:15] already right or we used should say in
[35:18] the in the Pentecostal Church uh uh uh
[35:21] Lord uh forgive me of my known and
[35:23] unknown sins what
[35:25] unknown you don't have no unknown sin if
[35:29] the Holy Ghost is there he check you
[35:30] before you even do it that's right
[35:33] that's right huh he checked you don't
[35:37] don't and we're like a
[35:41] child right but that's that's he said
[35:45] we're children and when we get over
[35:48] there we'll still be
[35:50] children so we we we you know oh you
[35:54] know iniquity he he had to die for the
[35:57] the iniquity of our our iniquity and
[35:59] iniquity is to to know to do good and do
[36:02] it it's not you know how many times
[36:05] during the day we do that amen that's
[36:07] right you know what I'm saying and so
[36:09] but he died for that but listen you
[36:12] can't be forgiven unless you confess
[36:14] your iniquity Lord I knew I did wrong
[36:17] don't say the devil made me do it the
[36:19] devil didn't make you do it you did it
[36:22] James said when we're drawn away we're
[36:24] drawn away with our own lust and entic
[36:28] that's coming from inside not outside
[36:31] y'all understand me but in order to get
[36:34] rid of that that what you you know it's
[36:36] it's being that
[36:38] light being that light you know one of
[36:42] the questions and I'm I'm going move
[36:44] forward because that light is God
[36:47] brought that light to us which is the
[36:48] Holy Spirit to to shine forth out of us
[36:52] nah we're not supposed to cloak it you
[36:55] know I mean you you're at a rest you're
[36:57] at a rest uh at a register and the Holy
[37:00] Ghost come and and hit you Hallelujah
[37:02] you need to say
[37:05] hallelujah cuz that person at the
[37:07] register might need that
[37:09] Hallelujah but sometime we so we we're
[37:12] not dead enough to we think about oh
[37:14] that might be embarrassing
[37:19] huh God is merciful to us is that right
[37:23] I think it was Ezekiel he told him to go
[37:26] make uh bread bread out of the dong of
[37:28] men that's
[37:30] right Ezekiel said Lord have
[37:34] mercy and gave him a beast to do it I
[37:37] think a cow whatever it was he had to
[37:39] make bread out of it and eat it now that
[37:42] sounds nasty but what it was that was
[37:46] the way God saw Israel amen so he had
[37:50] reflect to Israel that he was preaching
[37:53] to Israel he was basically through his
[37:55] action he was preaching to is Israel
[37:58] what God was saying about
[38:01] them
[38:03] right and he did it he did just what God
[38:06] Said do
[38:08] am right I was
[38:12] there you said what brother Brooks
[38:15] there's only let me tell you there's
[38:16] only one man suffered more than
[38:18] job as far as the records shows and that
[38:21] was Jesus Christ
[38:24] am so if Jesus said Lord I come not to
[38:27] do my own will but thy will be done so
[38:31] understand this that's where you die
[38:34] that's where Jesus had to die in
[38:35] Gethsemane he needed his will to
[38:39] dieen so God's will could be be made
[38:43] manifest did he fear Pro his punishment
[38:46] did was there something as a man he did
[38:48] not want to go to Calvary you understand
[38:51] me right and sometimes there are things
[38:53] in your life you don't want to give up
[38:55] but you got to give up in order to man
[38:57] EST
[38:59] Christ not my will but thine be done
[39:02] Lord let's move on you love the
[39:05] Lord so we can see we were there I
[39:08] believe that and because I believe that
[39:09] I believe it's going to be made
[39:11] manifested in me I believe when I read
[39:13] that scripture it was like the angel
[39:15] coming to Mary said thou shall y you
[39:18] you're favorite of God and you're going
[39:19] to bring forth the Son of God and I
[39:21] believe in my life and in your life and
[39:23] you could believe it we're here to bring
[39:25] forth the life of of the son of God amen
[39:28] we've been birthed into another
[39:30] dimension and um yeah that's why the
[39:33] devil fights me so much he knows I I got
[39:35] an understanding of what God is
[39:37] requiring and he's doing everything to
[39:39] keep me from getting there but the point
[39:41] is he can't stop
[39:44] this he can't because you know what he
[39:47] what the word of God says he that begun
[39:49] the good work in you is faithful to
[39:50] complete it the devil might hold you up
[39:52] a little bit but he can't stop
[39:55] it let's go back let's go to uh St John
[40:01] please God always show a witness the
[40:04] Bible said he never left himself without
[40:05] a witness and even sometime when you
[40:07] think you all by yourself there's
[40:09] somebody
[40:11] testifying right you go down to the
[40:14] marketplace and we see Christians down
[40:16] there and you say well they don't belong
[40:17] they ain't in the message most of them
[40:19] people are in the message more than
[40:21] message people that's
[40:24] true they are definitely witnessing
[40:26] Jesus Christ
[40:28] amen you say oh no well John
[40:34] did and John disciples did what they
[40:37] could do to witness Jesus Christ they
[40:39] just not didn't have the baptism in the
[40:40] name of Jesus Christ they had not yet
[40:42] received the Holy Ghost but they were
[40:45] anointed brother bam said they were
[40:52] anointed John 1 St John 1
[40:57] 7-10 the same came for a witness to Bear
[41:01] witness of the light what are you doing
[41:03] this is the light of the hour this is
[41:05] the message of the hour we come to Bear
[41:07] witness of the
[41:09] light right we come to Bear witness of
[41:11] the light that all men through him might
[41:14] believe he was not that light talking
[41:17] about John but was sent to Bear witness
[41:20] of that light like brother brandham
[41:22] brother brandham was not the light but
[41:24] he came to bear witness of the light why
[41:26] amen cuz everybody had their revelation
[41:29] of
[41:30] Jesus but he was the only one that could
[41:33] identify the true Jesus
[41:35] Christ because he was like
[41:38] John that's why I say in in in in Paul
[41:42] said there are many
[41:44] jesuses and even today they are many
[41:46] jesuses denominational
[41:49] jesuses right but there is a real
[41:53] Jesus and that Jesus is has has has has
[41:57] been identified by the by Malachi
[42:00] 4 and we come to make manifest that
[42:03] that's the real one what's the
[42:05] difference between us if there's no
[42:07] Supernatural here that's right we what
[42:11] witnessing we doing because I'm going to
[42:12] tell you like this there are many
[42:14] Pentecostal churches that are doing
[42:18] Supernatural and that's the children's
[42:21] bread am but we need a
[42:25] life that is so with so full of love
[42:29] that people can feel it as it approaches
[42:33] that's one thing I Love About Animals
[42:35] most animals know when you love
[42:38] them you can be you can you can you can
[42:40] be I've seen this on TV and I as
[42:43] documentaries people that love lions are
[42:45] not afraid of lions and the Lions
[42:48] respect
[42:50] them most of the
[42:53] time now if you catch them in a hungry
[42:55] spell that might be something different
[42:58] but if they're not hungry right because
[43:00] their instinct is to kill and eat but if
[43:02] they're not hungry they will respect you
[43:05] how many tribes you've seen you know
[43:07] those the the African fellas they they
[43:09] get on a group and they walk they kill a
[43:13] I've seen where they go and take the
[43:14] Lion's
[43:16] meat and break it up and then leave out
[43:19] the lion leaves the lion
[43:21] bewildered what what what makes them do
[43:24] that
[43:25] faith that that that's that's that's
[43:27] faith that makes them believe that and
[43:30] and you know what one thing about faith
[43:32] I don't care how nature is nature has to
[43:35] obey faith faith is a law of God whether
[43:39] you be a sinner or a saint yes sir that
[43:42] faith has to be obeyed
[43:45] amen and that's that's the way it
[43:48] works but anyway let's move on he was
[43:52] not that light but was sent to Bear
[43:54] witness of that light that was the True
[43:58] Light which lith every man that cometh
[44:00] into the world he was in the world and
[44:03] the world was made by him and the world
[44:06] knew him not is't that amazing but then
[44:09] you and I have an opportunity to know
[44:13] him my God that is so that is so amazing
[44:18] to me you know what I'm saying I'm going
[44:20] tell you one thing one thing y'all may
[44:22] not some of y'all may not even think
[44:24] about it but you know what even the fish
[44:28] of the ocean obeys
[44:31] God even unto the
[44:34] death where all those fish came that
[44:36] Peter
[44:39] caught you know most fish if they saw a
[44:42] net or knew a net was there to try to
[44:43] get rid of uh get out of it but those
[44:46] fish
[44:47] gathered so
[44:50] many and what was it God making it
[44:55] happen and and all he had to do is say
[44:59] throw the net on the other
[45:02] side and the fish wherever they were
[45:05] whether he created them or not at that
[45:08] point in time had to
[45:13] obey nothing but the
[45:16] truth Nothing But The
[45:18] Truth Listen let me move on coming from
[45:22] the message at Thy word Lord now you see
[45:25] how you get all of this because we can't
[45:27] physically touch him this is not a
[45:30] physical thing this is spiritual and now
[45:33] we he he he touches us and we touches
[45:36] him right we we must learn by the grace
[45:39] of God that this thing is a growing I I
[45:42] tell you what one thing I I I wish
[45:44] sometime I have wished I've had wish I
[45:48] in the past I
[45:49] wished that when I got saved I would be
[45:52] would have been made perfect
[45:54] complete but you know what I would not
[45:58] enjoy heaven like I'm going to enjoy
[46:01] amen that's right right every
[46:05] trial every test everything we go
[46:08] through is benefiting us to the point
[46:12] that when we get to heaven you'll never
[46:14] get tired am you'll never get tired of
[46:18] heaven heaven will never be
[46:21] boring you'll never get
[46:23] tired there will always be something
[46:27] because God is eternal there will always
[46:29] be something new am because God love
[46:33] Revelation amen now when we get there
[46:35] the revelation of Salvation will be
[46:37] complete but what about the revelation
[46:39] of Heaven what about the revelation of
[46:41] eternal life y'all know what I'm saying
[46:44] it won't
[46:45] stop there won't be just a book of 66
[46:49] books you know what I'm saying that word
[46:52] will be a Living Word you'll be the
[46:54] Living Word and God won't even have to
[46:56] tell you what what to do you will
[46:57] already
[47:00] know you have the Mind you'll have the
[47:03] mind of God like Adam did in the
[47:06] beginning God didn't say Adam this is
[47:08] the way I want you to name the Adam uh
[47:10] animals his mind and God mind was so
[47:12] connected Adam didn't skip a beat he
[47:15] named every animal the just the way God
[47:17] thought those animals should be
[47:20] named let's move on I'm enjoying this
[47:24] then when he come from that that message
[47:27] at Thy word uh paragraph 18 then when he
[47:30] come out here to the side of the mount
[47:34] isn't that something I believe the
[47:36] Apostle said that our trials are better
[47:39] than gold to US think of it God might
[47:44] have let you get sick in order that you
[47:46] might be a testimony that he might heal
[47:49] you that you can stand on his word then
[47:53] when you reach the opposition you can
[47:55] say I I know beyond the shadow of a
[47:59] doubt you're oh my see witness to me in
[48:03] Jerusalem Judea Samaria witness is
[48:07] somebody who's really done something
[48:09] been somewhere or seen something is that
[48:12] right now remember a witness has to be a
[48:15] witness a eyewitness to know what that
[48:19] speaking of it can't be secondary if you
[48:23] go down here at the courthouse and say
[48:25] I've seen a W on the street and you
[48:28] looked at it through a window glass you
[48:31] could not be a witness got to be right
[48:34] there personally you can't double see
[48:38] things you got to be a correct witness
[48:43] you understand me so you can't go by
[48:45] somebody
[48:46] else's uh testimony you got to have your
[48:50] own right St John 8 18-19 any questions
[49:00] oh it's about that time just give me a
[49:01] few more minutes I'm almost at the
[49:03] end I get carried away I get carried
[49:07] away all right let's just
[49:11] go okay so you understand that not only
[49:14] did Jesus have a witness Jesus was a
[49:16] witness of God himself this I I I work
[49:20] with that so that you understand you
[49:21] have to be a witness St John 8:1
[49:24] 18-19 I'm one that bear bear witness of
[49:28] myself and the father that send me sent
[49:32] me bearth witness of me you know what he
[49:35] mean by that I'm bearing witness of
[49:37] myself that means I know who I am but
[49:40] then the Holy Spirit Bears witness of me
[49:43] too amen the father in other words when
[49:46] I pray for you I'm bearing witness that
[49:49] I'm believing it but when you get healed
[49:52] that's the Holy Ghost bearing witness of
[49:55] me and of himself you understand me then
[49:59] said they unto him where is thy father
[50:02] Jesus answered ye neither know me nor my
[50:05] father if you had known me you should
[50:08] have known my father also amen
[50:11] hallelujah is that all right so let me
[50:14] give you this last quote and then I'll
[50:16] let you go coming from the message life
[50:20] story this is just the beginning of what
[50:23] we're doing here
[50:28] paragraph three I believe it is right
[50:30] above there but there are many of those
[50:32] things that that I see but I don't have
[50:35] time but what is it friends that doesn't
[50:38] mean so much the thing of it as long as
[50:41] there's faith will touch God they'll see
[50:45] themselves that is done you see so
[50:48] that's over see in other words you have
[50:51] faith in God God going to Bear witness
[50:53] that his word is true and he bear
[50:55] witness and his word is true by healing
[50:57] you if I speak it what I speak here
[51:00] confirms what I'm talking about if I
[51:02] speak not God's word but I have a
[51:05] witness and God is my witness see I'm
[51:09] I'm thankful to have my brothers as as a
[51:11] witness of the Gospel but I have a
[51:14] witness with my brethren and my friends
[51:17] and and I have the greatest witness is
[51:19] my heavenly father who confirms what I'm
[51:22] saying to be the truth and I'm so
[51:24] thankful for that then it is isn't that
[51:27] it isn't I that does the healing which
[51:29] you know so if you say it to the people
[51:33] as long as I see they got healed that's
[51:37] all I care for you see to see that they
[51:40] got the blessing so you understand we're
[51:43] not here to be to Bear witness of
[51:45] ourselves when somebody get healed no
[51:47] it's not like I did it and I just laid
[51:50] my I remember the one sister Pentecost I
[51:53] laid my hand on her like that and God
[51:56] healed her like power was the name and
[51:58] she say see looking at her hand ain't no
[52:01] healing in your
[52:05] hand healing is in Jesus Christ we lay
[52:09] hands on the sick they shall recover
[52:10] that's because we OB be we are obeying
[52:14] what he wants us to do we are obedient
[52:17] to the word so therefore he vindicates
[52:19] himself through the the through our
[52:24] obedience right and you know I I love
[52:27] this because I want you to understand a
[52:30] Christian must be a witness of
[52:34] Heaven let's
[52:37] stand oh I want to go to heaven not if
[52:41] that's the way you
[52:43] acting right your life has to be
[52:46] different they've got to see something
[52:49] different right if you're going to be a
[52:51] true witness of Jesus Christ don't be
[52:53] ashamed of him we're not of this world
[52:56] we're from a different world and listen
[52:58] we don't have much time it's later than
[53:00] what most people think everybody's not
[53:03] going to hear that you understand what
[53:04] I'm saying most people going say oh you
[53:07] know the Lord delayeth his
[53:09] coming yeah but you know what the
[53:12] Rapture is
[53:13] overdue your Prophet said that it's
[53:16] overdo and what is he waiting for me and
[53:19] you those who have not made it across
[53:22] that
[53:23] line but when that last one make it
[53:26] across it's
[53:28] over but while we're here let's work
[53:31] like the scripture says while it is day
[53:35] let let your light so shine among men
[53:38] let us pray F father God we thank you
[53:39] for your grace and your mercy we thank
[53:41] you for being so good to us we thank you
[53:44] for this little lesson oh Lord I Want To
[53:45] Be A Witness Lord no matter where I go I
[53:48] want my words to be seasoned with salt
[53:51] Lord help me oh God that my mind would
[53:53] think good and not evil Lord if there be
[53:56] anything anything that's in my life in
[53:57] our lives that's not proper and right
[54:00] before you Lord we ask oh God that you
[54:02] forgive us and cleanse us from all our
[54:04] sins help us now in the name of Jesus
[54:06] Christ we pray amen one more thing as
[54:10] you go one of the reasons why most
[54:13] people don't witness to other people is
[54:15] because they're ashamed of their lives
[54:18] they claim to be Christians but they're
[54:20] asham of their lives so how can you tell
[54:23] somebody what God can do and how you can
[54:25] overcome if you haven't overcome
[54:28] yourself and the truth of the matter is
[54:30] that's the trick of the devil none of us
[54:33] are perfect and we need to tell listen
[54:36] we need to tell people about Jesus no
[54:39] matter what how many faults you got have
[54:42] or whatever tell somebody you know when
[54:45] I get over there I don't want to be
[54:47] empty-handed I want to I want to I don't
[54:49] know what crowns I actually made of I
[54:51] like that but I want somebody say well
[54:53] you know if it had not been for the
[54:54] Hallelujah if it had not been for the
[54:56] life of brother Brooks what I saw
[54:58] through him I saw Jesus in you that's
[55:01] what I want you helped me come through
[55:04] that's what I want I want that kind of
[55:07] life that somebody can stand up and
[55:09] testify Lord he's been a blessing to me
[55:12] if it hadn't been for him you know what
[55:14] I'm saying let my life affect somebody
[55:18] in a positive way that's all I'm saying
[55:21] that's a witness you know a witness is
[55:24] not just running your mouth but a
[55:26] witness is the life because people going
[55:28] to watch you watch everything you say
[55:31] watch what you do that's the way people
[55:32] will do father God we thank you for your
[55:35] grace your mercy we thank you for being
[55:38] so good to us hallelujah father you've
[55:41] been better to us than we've been to
[55:42] ourselves thank you for this group who
[55:45] has been patience I try to keep it to an
[55:47] hour and I always run a few minutes over
[55:49] but I pray father God that the the few
[55:52] minutes were not done in vain bless us
[55:55] Lord as we have Departed from this place
[55:57] may we stay connected with you in Jesus
[56:00] Christ's name we pray amen visit with
[56:03] his minist
