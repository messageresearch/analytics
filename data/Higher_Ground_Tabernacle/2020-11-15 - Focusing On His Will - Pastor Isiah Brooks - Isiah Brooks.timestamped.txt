[41:54] really the only ambition the son of
[41:58] bishop
[41:58] to see jesus christ glorified that son
[42:00] of bishops
[42:06] because of the testimony that god has
[42:08] given me throughout the years
[42:13] i tried my best to be his humble servant
[42:17] poetry and if i had
[42:21] a million years this is available i had
[42:24] that much life
[42:25] left to live
[42:29] evil i want to live every minute
[42:32] for him
[42:35] you understand me amen and if i knew

[42:44] it's such a privilege to live for him

[43:37] your wife
[43:47] amen amen i wish these words were just
[43:49] my own
[43:52] spirit
[44:06] he
[44:18] we're going to come from the scripture
[44:20] reading the law of vienna bible
[44:26] saintly luke 22 luke
[44:29] [Music]
[44:34] vendor
[44:36] we have began reading at the 39th verse
[44:42] and we'll read down to the 40th sixth
[44:48] verses
[44:52] and he came out and went as he
[44:55] went as he was
[44:59] walked to the mount of olive and the
[45:02] disciples also
[45:04] followed him
[45:13] and when he was at the place he said
[45:16] unto them pray
[45:17] that ye enter not into temptation
[45:27] and he was withdrawn from them about
[45:30] a stone cast and kneeled down and prayed
[45:44] for me saying father
[45:48] if thou be willing remove this cup from
[45:51] me
[45:52] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[45:54] done
[45:58] the more i said cooper's
[46:04] and there appeared an angel unto him
[46:06] from heaven
[46:07] strengthening him
[46:14] and being in agony he prayed more
[46:17] earnestly
[46:18] and his sweet and sweet excuse me was as
[46:22] it was were great drops of blood
[46:25] falling down to the ground
[46:38] and when he rose up from prayer and was
[46:41] come to his disciples
[46:42] he found them sleeping for sorrow
[46:54] fatigue
[47:13] one more scripture john the fifth
[47:14] chapter
[47:22] john
[47:24] we'll read the thirtieth verse today
[47:32] and it reads i can of my own self
[47:36] do nothing
[47:40] as i hear i judge jesus
[47:44] and my judgment is just emojis
[47:48] because i seek not my own will on the
[47:51] fence in the shell spa affairs
[47:53] river but the will of the father which
[47:56] have sent me.
[48:04] i will entitle this message on this
[48:06] morning focusing on his will
[48:09] uh
[48:16] focusing on his will
[48:32] let us pray father god we thank you for
[48:35] your grace and your mercy
[48:39] and your grace we pray this morning
[48:44] that you would have your preeminence
[48:49] those who are listening by way
[48:52] of the air yeah
[48:56] we pray that lord that you would touch
[48:57] their hearts
[48:59] you would open their understanding could
[49:01] you follow antonio to the word today
[49:04] they may see the times we're living in
[49:06] they could widely talk
[49:08] that they may draw closer to you we ask
[49:11] these things in jesus christ
[49:24] and i read the scripture this morning
[49:29] normally we read this passage of
[49:32] scripture
[49:33] coming from luke
[49:36] during the time of the season
[49:42] but this particular scene that jesus
[49:44] christ
[49:45] in the garden of gethsemane
[49:50] always meant so much to me
[49:56] because jesus christ himself jesus
[49:59] christ
[50:00] went to calvary as a man
[50:04] even though he was the son of god
[50:06] memphis feasted you
[50:08] even though he was god because the bible
[50:11] says in him dwelt the fullness of the
[50:14] godhead bodily basketball
[50:16] only playing the truth he was a man
[50:20] he wanted the perfect will of god
[51:03] we are given as living sacrifices
[51:14] and being that we are the temple of god
[51:17] it don't only dump it
[51:18] we are the place in which god resides
[51:48] and
[52:04] especially of a deliberate action
[52:10] especially of a deliberate action
[52:15] amen amen the mind
[52:26] is that right it's what we call uh when
[52:29] we come to christ
[52:30] this or even before we come to christ
[52:34] we have a free will
[52:37] hallelujah hallelujah and god will never
[52:40] take that will
[52:41] away from you the will
[52:45] is something that you must surrender to
[52:47] god
[52:49] hallelujah amen as the brother said
[52:52] willingly
[52:56] amen when we think about god's will
[53:26] is that
[53:40] when we
[53:53] was created in god's will
[54:06] he was literally in control of
[54:08] everything
[54:10] he was in control of the animals he was
[54:13] in control of the
[54:15] the the atmosphere he was control
[54:18] in control of eden itself
[54:21] amen
[54:36] because it was lucifer or satan
[54:41] in the form of the serpent that
[54:44] taught eve reasoning
[54:48] reasoning is contrary
[55:04] a revelation from god you've been on the
[55:07] jew
[55:08] every man and woman they don't have
[55:11] faith
[55:13] but faith in itself is a gift from
[55:18] god
[55:30] now i'm going to tie what i did preach
[55:32] the other day
[55:35] i was working with the golden
[55:36] candlesticks the
[55:38] uh chandelier we talked about the golden
[55:41] candle
[55:42] stick knows we usually put
[55:45] s on it but it's not a plural
[55:50] famous in the primo yeah because if you
[55:53] read zechariah
[55:55] he referred to this golden candle stick
[55:58] he is
[56:14] that it was the uh uh way of
[56:17] entrance into the holy sentence this is
[56:22] important
[56:24] this is important because we find out
[56:28] that in the
[56:29] in the book of revelation
[56:32] it was jesus christ who stood in the
[56:35] midst of the
[56:36] states hallelujah
[56:40] hallelujah and whenever you see the
[56:43] number seven
[56:46] represents god hallelujah hallelujah
[56:50] seven angels sit down seven thunders
[56:53] sit down seven seals six so seven
[56:57] days since you hallelujah hallelujah
[57:00] whenever you see the number seven
[57:02] it represents god yeah the number six i
[57:05] represent you it is amazing
[57:07] see uh uh that this particular
[57:11] stick okay oh
[57:14] it's in the midst of the six
[57:19] three on this side and three on that
[57:22] side
[57:24] y'all understand me let's cool so we're
[57:25] not of course this is not a
[57:27] perfect thing this is not a perfect
[57:30] replica
[57:32] but i'm doing the best that i could be
[57:33] about
[57:35] but we said on the other day
[57:39] this particular candlestick okay
[57:42] was it made out of one piece of gold
[57:45] so they fit the the the different
[57:49] law and all of the uh uh uh uh
[57:52] uh utensils
[57:56] are the pieces that were in the holy
[57:58] place
[58:02] it was made out of that one piece
[58:05] of gold the
[58:17] because the bible says in the beginning
[58:20] was the word
[58:22] and the world was with god and the word
[58:24] was god
[58:26] did you so the bible tells us that
[58:29] everything that was made
[58:31] was made by jesus christ
[58:35] [Music]
[58:45] so if god made adam
[58:48] he
[59:01] is what made him deity
[59:16] is that right this is why
[59:19] you see throughout hollywood
[59:22] everybody want to be a superman or a
[59:25] super woman
[59:26] everybody wants supernatural powers
[59:29] because there's
[59:30] something that's laying in the conscious
[59:32] of mankind
[59:37] that he is a fallen man and he's not to
[59:41] be just a
[59:42] natural man but god created man
[59:45] supernaturally hallelujah
[59:48] there is a supernatural part of man
[59:52] that needs to be awakened and the only
[59:55] person person that can awaken that
[59:58] is god
[1:00:13] but some of the letters the law but are
[1:00:16] able ministers of the spirit
[1:00:19] let me to sell this that the spirit
[1:00:21] takes the letter
[1:00:22] it is manifest it in the manifesto
[1:00:26] hallelujah
[1:00:28] as i said in one of the services before
[1:00:30] congratulations jesus christ says i
[1:00:33] am the bread of life jesus christ he
[1:00:36] also says
[1:00:37] i am that manner i am that bread
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:54] and the word
[1:01:05] and they still don't know what it is
[1:01:21] and wrote this bible uh by the
[1:01:25] inspiration of god
[1:01:26] let's be honest so this is not just man
[1:01:30] lettering on pages
[1:01:34] but this bible is the word of god be
[1:01:37] blessed
[1:01:38] like i said it comes it is also the
[1:01:41] bread
[1:01:42] say oh see but when the bread of god was
[1:01:44] brought in by the levite
[1:01:51] and it took the shekinah glory to make
[1:01:54] it right
[1:01:57] it took god to bring the fullness of the
[1:02:00] bread to life
[1:02:02] hallelujah oh glory
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:17] to give us a revelation of what the
[1:02:20] bread is saying
[1:02:23] is that right that's because you can't
[1:02:25] understand this bible
[1:02:27] without the holy spirit this week
[1:02:30] we can't thousands of years have passed
[1:02:35] and we've got a we've got a bookstores
[1:02:38] all over the world
[1:02:40] trying to explain this bible explicit
[1:02:44] and they still don't know what it is
[1:02:59] y'all understand what i'm trying to say
[1:03:13] because the word is god
[1:03:16] hallelujah hallelujah now
[1:03:19] but it takes the holy spirit said it's a
[1:03:21] part of sentence we
[1:03:23] to unfold the word of god to us
[1:03:27] remember israel experience
[1:03:31] this it's all experimental when there
[1:03:33] was no prophet in the land
[1:03:34] everybody perfected right there they had
[1:03:36] the scrolls
[1:03:39] they gave it to the intellectuals
[1:03:42] and told
[1:03:57] i couldn't i cannot give me this
[1:03:59] hallelujah why
[1:04:01] because the book is shut like the book
[1:04:04] is closed
[1:04:05] without the anointing of god and when
[1:04:08] there is no prophet in the land
[1:04:19] except the father i'm sorry
[1:04:22] the word of the lord will will not be
[1:04:24] revealed
[1:04:26] except he reveals it to his servant the
[1:04:28] prophet
[1:04:30] said revelation comes by way of a
[1:04:32] prophet
[1:04:34] because the bible says that no man has
[1:04:37] his own interpretation
[1:05:05] all you must do is believe what it's
[1:05:07] saying
[1:05:09] what i'm saying hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:12] it's it's like when moses was given the
[1:05:15] scrolls
[1:05:17] no man could add or take away from it
[1:05:32] now we understand that the spirit it
[1:05:34] takes the spirit the component
[1:05:36] is free to bring it to pass that's going
[1:05:39] to spread that man
[1:05:42] for an example uh an example from an
[1:05:44] example i just said
[1:05:46] uh conceived
[1:06:17] maybe he made a mistake in this place he
[1:06:20] said
[1:06:21] but there was no way that he could make
[1:06:22] a mistake
[1:06:24] because it was not isaiah who prophesied
[1:06:28] hallelujah is that bible the bible said
[1:06:31] the spirit of prophecy
[1:06:33] is jesus christ so it was jesus christ
[1:06:37] in isaiah prophesying the word
[1:06:41] a virgin shall conceive y'all hear what
[1:06:43] i'm saying
[1:06:45] this is important since it's important
[1:06:47] because you and i know i'm going to go
[1:06:48] back to this
[1:06:51] the candlestick was right
[1:06:54] in the holy place they did not
[1:06:58] understand
[1:07:12] but it was more to the candlesticks
[1:07:17] it was just a type of christ
[1:07:20] is that right that's the bible because
[1:07:22] jesus christ
[1:07:23] is the only one who can give you light
[1:07:42] zachariah what is it that you see
[1:07:45] guess what zechariah knew about the
[1:07:48] candlesticks
[1:07:49] uh god was now getting ready to
[1:07:52] enlighten him
[1:08:07] it was something that christ was going
[1:08:09] to do through the ages
[1:08:11] christian hallelujah it meant more than
[1:08:14] just giving light
[1:08:15] for the priests at that time hallelujah
[1:08:19] but it was giving light to every church
[1:08:22] age it is
[1:08:35] being in human flesh
[1:08:45] oh my god this candlestick represented
[1:08:48] the humanity of god
[1:09:04] we need the light
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:15] in order to make the next step
[1:09:18] you need
[1:09:22] oh my god in order to go beyond the veil
[1:09:27] because no unclean thing will enter
[1:09:30] behind the veil
[1:09:32] y'all
[1:09:47] is it a song represent the prayers of
[1:09:50] the saints
[1:09:51] of the son hallelujah hallelujah oh come
[1:09:54] on somebody
[1:09:55] remember let's go back i'm dealing with
[1:09:58] the
[1:09:58] perfection of mantis
[1:10:14] right now
[1:10:20] into the image of jesus christ
[1:10:23] who is the son of god y'all understand
[1:10:27] this
[1:10:28] if we are brethren in which jesus christ
[1:10:31] calls us
[1:10:32] brethren that means we came from the
[1:10:34] same mama
[1:10:36] and the same daddy hallelujah and that's
[1:10:39] the only person we know like that
[1:10:41] hallelujah
[1:10:42] it's
[1:11:11] this has been the mystery of god
[1:11:13] throughout all the ages
[1:11:16] oh well i'm a christian and you're just
[1:11:18] living your life any kind of way
[1:11:22] no sir no no ma'am no
[1:11:38] let me finish up this quote i'm sorry
[1:11:44] see the word of god the way moses
[1:11:47] brought it
[1:11:48] that was just law you had to go
[1:11:52] look at it
[1:11:56] thou shall not commit adultery thou
[1:11:59] shalt not steal
[1:12:00] it thou shalt not lie to your name thou
[1:12:03] shall not do this
[1:12:06] uh
[1:12:18] that comes upon the promised word for
[1:12:34] hallelujah
[1:12:48] why because god knows them
[1:12:52] that are hidden
[1:12:55] hallelujah and you know this is one of
[1:12:57] my favorite scriptures
[1:12:59] he that begun the good work in you is
[1:13:01] faithful to
[1:13:02] completed
[1:13:49] hallelujah see right
[1:13:53] this this once the spirit gets comes on
[1:13:56] you
[1:13:57] god it's with you brings
[1:14:32] is that right that's what john said she
[1:14:34] says if you're truly baptized of the
[1:14:36] holy ghost
[1:14:37] you'll be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:14:40] and fight
[1:14:45] so when you put all these licks of fire
[1:14:48] together
[1:14:51] it should be more fire in here than the
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:09] i want you to be free i want you to come
[1:15:11] out of this
[1:15:12] routine religion hallelujah
[1:15:16] god is not into routineness
[1:15:20] in freedom and where the
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:35] that he inhabits the praise of his
[1:15:37] people
[1:15:38] hallelujah i don't care what you're
[1:15:40] going through
[1:15:42] you have to come here with a praise on
[1:15:44] your lips
[1:15:45] hallelujah listen the pride of jesus
[1:15:48] christ
[1:15:49] she does not sing the blues hallelujah
[1:15:53] she doesn't come in here amen sounded
[1:15:56] like
[1:15:56] some sad notes but she's those happy
[1:15:59] notes on the piano
[1:16:01] hallelujah she brings joy with her why
[1:16:04] because she
[1:16:18] with thanksgiving
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:33] that ain't god hallelujah that is the
[1:16:36] devil
[1:16:37] working on your mind why because the
[1:16:40] bible says
[1:16:42] in his presence where's the fullness of
[1:16:46] joshua
[1:16:58] that this uh uh word okay
[1:17:03] anointed bring forth a manifestation
[1:17:08] of manifestation not just not just two
[1:17:10] tables of stones
[1:17:14] hallelujah but the presence of the
[1:17:16] living god
[1:17:18] did you know that that's complete israel
[1:17:20] got confused israelite confused
[1:17:22] they thought that the anointing of god
[1:17:26] only uh was for the ark of the covenant
[1:17:34] they thought that's where god is to show
[1:17:37] up
[1:17:39] in other words they made a a religion
[1:17:43] is an unfair religion and so when the
[1:17:46] ark of the covenant was taken from them
[1:17:51] that was like god being taken from them
[1:17:55] and they failed to see that's not really
[1:17:58] where god wanted to dwell
[1:17:59] since the part would you believe it
[1:18:01] might be dead
[1:18:03] the covenant was just a replica
[1:18:06] somewhere else
[1:18:08] where god wanted to dwell
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:24] and you're not uh circumcised
[1:18:27] hallelujah it will bring death to you
[1:18:31] hallelujah but remember when
[1:18:34] when when when uh david saw the ark of
[1:18:37] the covenant
[1:18:38] returning
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:48] he became a holy roller holy roller
[1:18:55] according to saul's daughter
[1:19:02] he was out of the church order
[1:19:06] i wish some of y'all would get out of
[1:19:08] church order i'd love to see this church
[1:19:10] get out of the church
[1:19:12] hallelujah i'd love to see you praise
[1:19:14] god and worship god
[1:19:15] like you feel it
[1:19:20] hallelujah y'all remember
[1:19:23] every child should know this
[1:19:27] it don't matter where where you where
[1:19:28] you came from yeah it's uh
[1:19:30] maybe it's just me maybe it's just me
[1:19:32] but i love rain
[1:19:34] medium i love the rain especially
[1:19:37] summer rain and spring rain and
[1:19:40] and when it would rain i would get happy
[1:19:44] i stand on the porch my mom would always
[1:19:48] read my mind
[1:20:11] it was something about the way the rain
[1:20:13] falls
[1:20:16] i was
[1:20:27] it was wonderful
[1:20:33] but that's the way it is when the rain
[1:20:36] falls in the church
[1:20:38] you're supposed to get in it soaking wet
[1:20:42] enjoy it hallelujah
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:21:05] and that is the way the rain is supposed
[1:21:07] to fall in the sun
[1:21:10] hallelujah hallelujah but when the rain
[1:21:12] is not falling they're kind of pretty
[1:21:14] dumb
[1:21:14] things get dried off the show's so so
[1:21:17] dried up and still starchy yeah he said
[1:21:20] if you have
[1:21:21] uh uh do you that's what has happened to
[1:21:23] a lot of churches
[1:21:26] they have been in such
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:38] hallelujah let's go on the lord
[1:21:42] knowing his will for our day
[1:21:45] we must understand we must know his will
[1:21:50] hallelujah hallelujah let's just say the
[1:21:52] way brother adam said it come
[1:21:54] on come
[1:22:09] so that adam and eve could not get to
[1:22:12] the tree of life
[1:22:18] an angel with swords
[1:22:21] so that he could keep them out of the
[1:22:23] way
[1:22:25] they said why because if adam and eve
[1:22:27] had gotten to the tree of life
[1:22:30] he would have been sinners forever
[1:22:34] we would have lived in that condition
[1:22:36] forever
[1:22:45] we needed someone that could come here
[1:22:50] hallelujah he's the only one that i know
[1:22:53] that can change the situation
[1:22:56] he can change a sinner to a saint bishop
[1:22:59] hallelujah he can take a murderer
[1:23:02] and sanctify him
[1:23:05] that right he's the only one
[1:23:09] mind over matter doesn't do it
[1:23:12] mind over matter can't do it
[1:23:16] no psychology psychology
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:46] that he is lord to the glory of god
[1:23:51] hallelujah that's why we pray in the
[1:23:53] name of jesus
[1:23:55] amen we love in the name of jesus
[1:23:58] we baptize in the name of jesus christ
[1:24:01] hallelujah
[1:24:02] and you'll be saved only in the name of
[1:24:04] jesus christ
[1:24:09] remember it was god's will to create man
[1:24:12] in his
[1:24:13] in his image
[1:24:17] that's why in saint john the first
[1:24:19] chapter
[1:24:21] and john when jesus came conscious
[1:24:24] the bible tells us that he was the real
[1:24:28] man
[1:24:40] what a real son and daughter of god was
[1:24:42] supposed to be sacred
[1:24:45] until jesus christ is that right
[1:24:49] that's what john says they said he was
[1:24:51] the light of me
[1:24:53] in other words he was the revelation of
[1:24:55] what a man supposed to be
[1:25:07] is that right because when god made
[1:25:10] jesus
[1:25:11] he didn't use joseph's blood and he
[1:25:14] didn't use mary's blood hallelujah
[1:25:16] the bible said it was god's own blood
[1:25:20] he was not contaminated
[1:25:24] so when we saw jesus we really saw the
[1:25:27] way a man supposed to be
[1:25:30] is that right he was a supernatural
[1:25:33] man he turned water into wise
[1:25:37] come on somebody you see
[1:25:40] and we seen jesus again
[1:25:43] and when i say this because we saw the
[1:25:46] son of man in our day
[1:25:48] feeling he when the bible said he will
[1:25:52] appear to those that
[1:25:54] come to those who love his appearance
[1:25:57] so he has to appear first in other words
[1:26:01] hebrews 13 must be a scripture made
[1:26:06] manifest before the people
[1:26:08] eyes in order for them to see jesus
[1:26:11] christ again
[1:26:13] hallelujah and that's what he did even
[1:26:16] though he was clothed in a prophet
[1:26:19] hallelujah it wasn't the prophet it was
[1:26:21] christ jesus
[1:26:22] manifesting himself again remember in
[1:26:25] the appearance of the son of man
[1:26:28] y'all hear what i'm saying and we saw
[1:26:30] that appearing
[1:26:31] and if we could see that appearing you
[1:26:33] will see his coming
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:42] i was looking at a little christian
[1:26:44] thing last night
[1:26:47] and it was it was really interesting
[1:26:49] because
[1:26:50] it dealt with the rapture
[1:26:53] and the way the world think is going to
[1:26:56] happen
[1:27:00] baby is disappearing in your face this
[1:27:02] year
[1:27:15] there's a lot of pretenders
[1:27:29] but they don't realize that the rapture
[1:27:32] is a process
[1:27:35] hallelujah enoch walked with god
[1:27:41] and was found not and enoch
[1:27:57] and the bible tells us
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:26] in
[1:28:42] you can't just walk in the pentecostal
[1:28:44] life
[1:28:46] because that light is gone
[1:28:49] hallelujah you know where we are we're
[1:28:52] beyond the seventh day
[1:28:54] where
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:29:06] that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:29:22] who really
[1:29:36] is
[1:29:49] when she covered her head with the veil
[1:29:52] that means she was surrendering her will
[1:29:55] and then isaac took her rebecca
[1:30:00] into his mother's tent which represented
[1:30:03] the old time
[1:30:05] time religion hallelujah amen not some
[1:30:08] of these
[1:30:09] new fandangos that's going on in america
[1:30:13] hallelujah a good rich quick scheme
[1:30:16] hallelujah but the old time religion
[1:30:20] you must be born again you must be
[1:30:23] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:30:26] for the remission of your sin the
[1:30:28] old-time way hallelujah
[1:30:30] you must receive the holy ghost
[1:30:46] and then with
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:14] until
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:28] at least that's the way it's supposed to
[1:31:30] be
[1:31:33] nowadays they got it midnight there's so
[1:31:35] where people don't have to wear veils
[1:31:37] and all that kind of stuff that's just
[1:31:38] too old
[1:31:40] but you see that's like taking the
[1:31:41] candelabra out of the out of the holy
[1:31:57] amen that's what the devil preached to
[1:31:59] eve that day
[1:32:01] girl you know you could be liberal you
[1:32:03] know
[1:32:04] you don't have to be under his head
[1:32:07] hallelujah
[1:32:08] i'll tell you what god's trying to hide
[1:32:10] something from him
[1:32:37] we need this mercy seat
[1:32:40] uh uh hallelujah
[1:32:44] and remember i told you that mercy seat
[1:32:46] was jesus christ hey sit down
[1:32:49] you mean the candle library was the
[1:32:51] mercy seat is
[1:32:52] everything is jesus dude hallelujah
[1:32:56] i showed you the other day that moses
[1:33:00] and elijah okay
[1:33:03] was actually the fulfillment
[1:33:06] of the ministry of jesus christ you've
[1:33:08] been established they were in like
[1:33:10] shadow and time
[1:33:11] he said they come uh we're talking about
[1:33:12] we're talking about revelation uh
[1:33:14] resurrection now
[1:33:16] we're talking about a quickly we're
[1:33:17] talking about bringing the
[1:33:19] body of christ into
[1:33:37] hallelujah but you must come to do his
[1:33:39] will
[1:33:41] god don't want no rebellious woman from
[1:33:44] uh
[1:33:45] god ain't looking for a rebel hallelujah
[1:33:48] god ain't going to allow
[1:33:50] you to take hardship from him
[1:33:53] where he leads me i will follow that's
[1:33:56] it
[1:33:58] hallelujah he's the shepherd and we're
[1:33:59] the sheep
[1:34:01] hallelujah you're going to let him tell
[1:34:03] you what to do oh yes
[1:34:05] ma'am i'm going to let him tell me what
[1:34:08] to do
[1:34:12] hallelujah hallelujah yes sister
[1:34:15] amen listen listen husbands
[1:34:19] love your wives amen for fun as christ
[1:34:22] love the church
[1:34:23] come christian please and never has god
[1:34:26] my lord
[1:34:27] made me a slave mo mo if i am a slave
[1:34:44] you're not fussing and fighting and
[1:34:46] carrying on him all that kind of
[1:34:48] stuff but you do things good willfully
[1:34:52] somebody pulled me off my subject
[1:34:56] but nevertheless man god is so good
[1:35:05] you know what is the balance the
[1:35:07] balancer
[1:35:10] of this bible they said we call it
[1:35:12] l-o-v-e the balance they said people
[1:35:15] appear to bring every scripture to life
[1:35:20] hallelujah hallelujah now we come to a
[1:35:23] place
[1:35:24] we're talking about the mercy seat and
[1:35:25] we're not going to go on too far with
[1:35:27] that
[1:35:29] because in order to to understand what
[1:35:32] god wants
[1:35:32] us to see secret you have working with
[1:35:34] remember it is
[1:35:35] christ was a christian who who does the
[1:35:38] choosing
[1:35:41] all of us could we would not even you
[1:35:43] know the gentiles
[1:35:45] was way only out of court it did work
[1:35:48] there was no place for us
[1:35:52] but because jesus christ
[1:36:03] oh yeah we had to come that way
[1:36:06] because that was the original way he set
[1:36:08] up what it did
[1:36:09] for the jews it never was supposed to be
[1:36:12] law
[1:36:14] it was supposed to be love it was
[1:36:16] supposed to be grace
[1:36:18] because love is the first message
[1:36:34] is that right oh yeah it was overlaid
[1:36:38] with gold
[1:36:38] and that that represented jesus christ's
[1:36:40] deity
[1:36:43] but it has all the wood underneath the
[1:36:44] gold
[1:36:46] which represented the humanity of jesus
[1:37:03] he had to get away from the crowd as a
[1:37:06] human man he hung god
[1:37:08] he developed hallelujah but that same
[1:37:11] human man
[1:37:12] was full of god hallelujah
[1:37:15] he was the same one that turned water
[1:37:17] into wine y'all hear what
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:33] it was god making himself flesh see that
[1:37:35] jesus
[1:37:36] hallelujah now the flesh is coming the
[1:37:39] word
[1:37:40] god in you the hope of glory
[1:37:45] there is a super race
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:38:29] you keep moving on higher is that right
[1:38:33] that's what he told us he said i go to
[1:38:35] the prayer but
[1:38:36] i go to prepare a place for you that
[1:38:38] where i
[1:38:39] am you may be also
[1:38:42] hallelujah
[1:38:47] so you understand by god's grace let me
[1:38:50] just let me come to this uh
[1:38:53] one of the things that this agent always
[1:38:55] keep us in bondage with
[1:39:08] let me read something here let's go
[1:39:20] and we and if we have confessed our sins
[1:39:22] it seems confusing
[1:39:23] they are blotted out is so if i say
[1:39:27] hallelujah hallelujah is that all right
[1:39:31] he said if we can we have confessed our
[1:39:34] sins jesus
[1:39:35] they are blotted out of the book of
[1:39:36] memory islam if i said
[1:39:45] now you can't do anything to me
[1:39:49] you can do anything to me
[1:39:52] and i'll forgive
[1:40:03] but god can forgive and forget it
[1:40:20] when it's not even remembered anymore
[1:40:23] because any memphis nothing can do
[1:40:27] it but god put a film in you
[1:40:30] nothing but god can do that oh yeah yeah
[1:40:33] he says
[1:40:47] because we only got these little finite
[1:40:50] senses
[1:40:56] but he's infinite he's infinite god
[1:41:01] he can absolutely forget it that it ever
[1:41:04] was
[1:41:05] done hallelujah
[1:41:08] now i that's the kind of god i want to
[1:41:10] serve john the jew
[1:41:12] hallelujah hallelujah so let me say
[1:41:13] another thing to help you
[1:41:16] and i'm not bringing you to a place
[1:41:18] there's a main point where you feel like
[1:41:20] you can sin and do whatever you want to
[1:41:22] do
[1:41:23] because the bible says god forbid shall
[1:41:27] we continue
[1:41:28] in sin that grace may abound
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:43] book of life
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:26] hallelujah
[1:42:32] those whose names are written in the
[1:42:34] lamb's book of life
[1:42:36] you're the only one who can go behind
[1:42:40] the veil
[1:42:49] where god has made you priests
[1:42:52] and kings now would you sacrifice
[1:43:06] i told you about that woman caught in
[1:43:08] adultery parliament
[1:43:11] caught an adulterer by by the word the
[1:43:13] law the law
[1:43:14] brought them and they don't flag on
[1:43:16] these i said sometimes the devils can
[1:43:17] bring you to jesus
[1:43:21] christ sometimes devils bring you to
[1:43:23] jesus
[1:43:25] you have a rough time out in the world
[1:43:27] you say oh i got to make jesus my choice
[1:43:33] hallelujah but they brought jesus caught
[1:43:35] in adultery
[1:43:39] they brought excuse me about the woman
[1:43:40] called an adulterer to jesus
[1:43:48] jesus went down starting from the elder

[1:43:55] the
[1:43:56] the the elders and it comes came down to
[1:43:59] the youngest
[1:43:59] i don't know how he should he knew how
[1:44:03] to do it
[1:44:13] is there going to be anybody with sin
[1:44:15] it's going to be the man who has the
[1:44:17] the greater of age
[1:44:34] what was the lord uh this is this is the
[1:44:37] kind of thing we're dealing with right
[1:44:38] now
[1:44:40] hallelujah yeah right now the the the
[1:44:43] with all the recordings that that's on
[1:44:45] these iphones and ipads say

[1:45:36] elect
[1:45:42] but see the judgment journey just didn't
[1:45:45] start
[1:45:45] stopping jesus jesus
[1:45:48] transferred the judgment to the woman
[1:45:50] called an adult
[1:45:51] jesus hallelujah
[1:45:55] he made her a part of the judgment the
[1:45:58] judging
[1:46:00] and he says woman when i defund where
