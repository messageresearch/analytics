him amen you love the Lord one thing we need to do was just have a little word of prayer before we start the service start the message let's just bow father we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we've come to this place in our day and time where you have given us a message and father you chose us out of millions to worship you and to serve you and father we realized that this is not a time of giving up this is not a time to quit or to turn back you never told us that the way would be easy for you say it O God our Father that if any man would be your disciple he must take up his cross and follow you and father we realize that the cross is a heavy burden to carry especially in this day according to your profit you he told us that this day was the most evilest age of all ages and yet you chose us insignificant people law to take your cross to take the Word of God and run into the day of the rapture father we realized that all everybody is being attacked or God in so many ways Lord God but father you said think it not strange when we are a bombarded with divers temptations knowing that the temptations Lord they come to strengthen our faith and father there is no other one we could turn to there is no friend you are the friend above all you are Savior you are our comforter Lord you are our deliverer you are our God and Lord we thank you this morning we feel the heaviness of the people this morning some of them are tired some are frustrated Lord but we know God that you are the joy giver hallelujah hey there's none like your father we pray that you touch each and every heart that will leave out of here this morning victorious and father will be careful to give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen here's my coupler I live it ah ah ah man quit this thirsting of my soul Oh bread of heaven feed me tea I walk no more here's my car fill it up and make me woo say it again here's my car I did come back with this birthing of my true bring up here [Applause] [Music] [Music] once again here's why a man you may be seated for just a moment we have our son Joseph and his wife caller they've come to have their baby dedicated Mya and if they want to come on up now we'll pray for her by God's grace that God will protect her strengthen her put a thirst in her heart that if she should live and lost your Terry it's going to hear it's hard for Joseph you let her go see little mind father God as we come before you Father God as we come before your Lord and we dedicate Maya to your Lord father she's a miracle baby when the devil said that Karla couldn't have any children Joseph and Kalla believed that God would bless you gave them this little infant regardless to what the doctors were saying and father we pray for a little Maya right now Lord that you would protect your Lord that both Carla and Joseph would raise them raise her up in the fear nomination of the Lord grant our Lord this grace protector keeper from all her common danger that your Holy Spirit be with them Lord in Jesus Christ's name listen with a double portion of your spirit an understanding of your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen leather stain once again we're going to be coming from Matthew the fourth chapter Matthew 4 Hebrews 10 Matthew the fourth chapter Hebrews 10 and then will be coming from Psalm 63 and 3 Matthew 4 fourth verse but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Hebrews 10:38 everybody believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe that with all my heart Hebrews 10:38 now the judge live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul one more scripture Psalm 63 and 3 thank you Jesus for your grace and your mercy Lord Psalm 63 and 3 because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name dear Jesus once again as we come to you we thank you for your amazing grace father we're living at a time where only a few will make it press you on every hand many are surrendering to the adversaries lies but father you said you'll never leave yourself without a witness and father we thank your father as we spoke or you spoke Lord when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God lifts up a standard and father we as the body of Christ love to be that standard in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle my message tonight this morning life what is it or what is life if I had a theme it would be living to live when we think about the beginning and understand there are more than one life there's two kind according to the message we realized there is a real life genuine and there is what we call a perverted life and understand that in the beginning when Eve took the devil's bait he offered her life offered her a better life but in reality we realized that the life he offered her was not life it was death and we realized by God's grace that that death have rain and was raining and in some people's lives still raining but the Bible said that death reigned - Jesus came now when we think about life a lot of times many of us think about just breathing the breath of life but even those who are dead lives because the Bible that if a woman lives in pleasure she's already dead and we understand by God's grace that there are definitions that maybe the dictionary tried to give and one of the definitions of life is is the condition that distinguishes organisms from in organ organic organic objects in other words of birds verses a rock a bird has life in a rock doesn't but we realize a man that it's also something that is manifested by way of growth and metabolism something that can reproduce or something that has their power to update to environmental things changes and things of that nature now we don't believe in the evolution in which which the scientists talks about but because of life we all have adapted where the venom tells us that because we are different colors have come by way of a Baptist there's one time we were one people of one language the Continental Divide brought us to a different place we ate of the soil some of us became black some of us became white some of us whatever the original was we all changed and understand by God's grace but we were all of one blood but because of life the inaturalist were able to maintain a continue on in our environment I mean just to say that let's say it like the European they have the smaller nose or the thin nose and that nose were given to them so that the cold air wouldn't go directly to their brain that would kill them but those of us who are black we have the wider nose and I like by and it was given to us so that because of the heat we didn't need to shut it off we needed it to survive so God didn't make a mistake and he allowed these things to take place but we are all of one blood sad to say Amen because of sin being a one blood causes all of us to die now there's nothing wrong with life in itself God said that he would that we all prosper even as our soul prosper so there's nothing wrong with prosperity job was a man who was wealthy he prospered but one thing job had that a lot of the others in his day did not have job had a different kind of life he had the real kind according to Cleese Yancy's 815 says then i commended Murr because a man have no better thing under the Sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life which God giveth him under the Sun so being able to prosper it's God's giving us something he's giving us a great thing in life this life but understand this life has an ending to it I'm living to live and she that's the difference with Adam and Eve they did not understand Adam did but he was to see she really had the genuine life she had something going on amen that she was not aware of if she had not if they had not sinned then we would not be afflicted in the way that we are you know there was no glasses in Eden and for those of us who wear them we know it's not going to get better every year because prescriptions get a little thicker why because it's something though we live we're dying in the flesh we're dying people you're dying this there's got to be something and let me say it like this every one of us has a thirst every one of us are not satisfied everyone there's only one true status at efficacious satisfying portion and that is the Holy Ghost why do you think you get lonely when you have friends why do you think Amen you feel all alone sometimes when there's so many people in the room you still feel that emptiness ah because there is a call it's a higher calling in your life God is trying to shake you and wake you trying to make you know that there's something that's greater than this the danger of this is this calling your life is is that sometimes people they try to rush it they become drug addicts alcoholics - nikita's adulteress all of this because there's a thirst something is trying to feel that life that hole in your heart something is you see but there's only one thing they can feel that that little spot in your heart can only be filled by God that little thing that that causes you to to be miserable sometime cry at night and sometime cry in the morning he is just is this God is calling you that light that is above this life right Davis said that loving-kindness is better than life huh what could be better than this I don't know where I read the Franklin is but some of y'all may not know who she is but I don't know where she is but I remember Amen when she was a little girl he meant you said how do you remember I had a dream about her years ago I saw the whole Aretha Franklin life my wife I tell you I've told this dream many time way before she died I saw all of that but she was really a female Judas who literally knew what the Holy Ghost felt she was one of those people and then that width and she tasted of the land she knew the joy of the Holy Ghost even said it on television she knew she had the Holy Ghost now she didn't have it in her soul but she had it she knew what the feeling of God was about but instead she chose the world you know she wasn't the first he was the first Eve understood him in the presence of the Lord she knew what it was all about but she chose the world now she's got to deal with a perverted life before he fell she had no pain she didn't know what it was what is it sisters that you and I go through are you brothers and sisters because brothers go to it too we call it meant appalls and on the brother side we call it the change of life what is it there's something on the inside that recognize you're dying and you're struggling for life hmm y'all know what I'm talking about when you see a 56 year old man or 70 year old man driving a sports car that's called change of life there's something in him that wants to remain young oh it's the same way with sisters sometime they don't even know what's going on them own with them but they want to be young again they do things that they don't normally do they wear clothes and things that they normally wouldn't do but they're do it anyway because they just feel like it and all it is is a change in life don't scorn them they can't help it just be there when they when you need they need you because one thing for sure brothers and sisters you're coming there too if the launcher Terry you're coming there too so that you'll know that I know what I'm talking about at the age of 40 I started going through my change at 45 I was insane from 45 to 50 totally with the Holy Ghost I was going through changes and doing things and think of things that you know it was just stupid but my wife and I started around the same time we talked about it I said honey when you see I need some space give me some space when I see you need space I'm gonna give you some right cuz that's the way it is you got to talk about it there was a time you know my wife would have everybody over con all over dinner come on over dinner all of a sudden Wow oh she don't mind I better be careful all I said she put it into it look like in one day so and I was sitting there wondering what is going on with my wife and at the same time I myself was going through changes people who come to my office they come up to my office for for for for counseling and I'm sitting there oh praise the Lord you yes whatever I can do but inside of me I was screaming but that's what it does it just somehow you can't explain it but you know that you're not in your right mind and guess what seem like you have no control we have no control at that time is when you need a friend at that time is when you really need somebody to talk to somebody to listen and not reply a good listener that's what I had you understand me but see that's in this life every animal watch it doesn't make any different you hit an animal on the street with the car all of a sudden you see them shaking in there and what are they doing they're fighting to remain to contain the life that they have in them even animals and we're part animal and so therefore we fight for it we fight for it but it doesn't make any difference your hair is gonna grow gray or ball like mine or both it is what it is you don't stay young all your life but that's what this life has given us this life gave us death this life gave us death I remember a sister said well I don't remember going through my menopause and she had been married three times she didn't have to remember her rector tells us now hear what I'm saying you must understand Amen by God's grace amen that we are in a a time body this body is based upon time and in order to save this body you must know one person they asked of eternal life am I making any sense now we talk about satisfying portion the only way that you're gonna come out of this disturb oh you know my thing is it's a blessing you know everybody loves nice things and and if you're not careful the devil of poodle trick over your eyes he'll make you lust and thirst out of after things other than God yeah I used to have such a bad habit that whenever I got depressed I usually eat or go buy something something that I thought was gonna make me feel good see y'all won't tell those stories but I'll tell it but you see what it was it was a devil amen making me try to feel this thing in my heart with something that was never going to satisfy me nothing in this world's gonna satisfy that first and why did God put that thirst in you so that you at the Day of Judgment will never say God I never thirst after you everyman thirst for the Living God even when Indians in here in America they didn't know God many of them didn't but they had something it's in you to worship it's in you to always look up there's gotta be somebody higher than I it's in you you're gonna worship a stone a frog a monkey or something you've gone to worship and sometimes it's worship of self you go worship something you're gonna try to feel this thing with something and brothers even brother branham said it like this he said that's where most men make their big mistakes is when they're going through a change of life when you go through a change of life you feel like nobody loves you you go through a state of paranoia people can say whatever they want to say to you and you're gonna twist it when you go through a change of life a man you feel so isolated and alone nobody understands me it is what it is you're dying and every one of us has will die in that manner except God takes us in a rapture it's just okay I'm living to live I'm gonna fight you see I was in such a bad state you know all men don't go through this the way I did but there were some brothers that I knew I didn't know them but I was told by my because that went through worse than I did because I would tell him something wrong with me here I'm crying and can't help but cry sometime and don't know why I'm crying and you know my wife would say something to me and my feelings get hurt not just my wife just anybody how I want you to understand I probably hurt her feelings too at times that I didn't even know it but we're sensitive because we're dying you understand me I'm trying to tell you or something I'm trying to say listen all of us enough backslidden state are dying as men and women you're dying you see when I got the Holy Ghost but your flesh is dying and your flesh is gonna want to live somehow and we're doing everything that it can do to live but we're not here to save the flesh we're here to save this whole hallelujah what is life to you just last week I came in here had a good time preaching and everything else got low and sick just just that quick sick I don't normally get sick I hardly ever get sick and when I do it's the flu or colon and I got something has something that's my wife my wife know when I'm sick because I stay at the bed all day how it's sick but nevertheless God restored me but look how quick things happens right death doesn't always give us warning it could take us just like that there's a brother in my church not in my church but used to teach at the school that we had down there in Lima Ohio he died just that way quickly he died in school he literally died right there boom and one of the sisters went over there laid hands on him and pray for me and God brought her back to life he lasted what about a few weeks or months wife goes upstairs he just ran down from downstairs had to go back upstairs for something she goes up there and he's dead don't hello what I'm trying to get over to us is this if there is a thirst in your life if there's something that's hungry for more God that means them Lord God for you you don't you don't hush it oh you know how we do oh I tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get on my phone I'm gonna watch this I'm gonna watch that whatever it is that Satan puts in your way when you need to be praying and talking to God that is the enemy he's trying to hush the call in you remember when the prophet of God talks about this minor this goldminer this minor that this man who hit and struck a gold mine and he had a vein this happy about this gold that he was about to have and he had a pet dog and this dog started barking that night and he said huh stop that barking see what it is he said listen that's that soul in you see if anybody knows everybody know where you standing death don't have to come to you to let you know where you spend you know the Bible said search yourself examine yourself see whether you be in the faith and every man know right now you know if you fall in short doesn't matter how we appear to be religious to one another we know if we're falling short hey and you and I realized Amen there is a barking don't let this peep listen just like I said because you believe the message doesn't save you the devil believes the message hallelujah understand amen Judas believe the message for his day but Judas fail to get up to the Holy Ghost hallelujah you must come all the way to the Holy Ghost if you just believed the message as we say you are just like the Methodist Baptist the Pentecostals they believe because one day they met there's a time their message was right and God moved right on hallelujah and everybody that's why people are just living any kind of way even in this message they're trying to satisfy their thirst with with wicked things and listen I don't care what kind of pleasure Satan can give you it will never replace the holy ghost happy moments in this life does not guarantee you to heaven everybody won't joy Turner and so the devil I give you fake joy here give you something to drink or something to smoke or something to take that will make you feel good but that is a false that is a lying spirit that is a spirit of deception that is a spirit amen of this life is that right remember the Prophet God went to Concannon de amen and while he was up there in Canada some of the Americans was up there and here was these women Amen half dressed and everything in they staggering me this is life they should have never said that around the Prophet hallelujah he said they were so drunk he went over there he grabbed both arm and he noticed that they had wedding rings on their fingers he said you ought to be ashamed of yourself you got your husband home babysitting it and hell you out here partying and things are like that well we were trying to have some clean fun see that's how the devil tricks you there is no such thing as clean fun not when it comes to that kind of a thing oh he said that ain't no life that's death he loved the Lord listen but here in Ephesians 4 says 17 he said this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind huh what is it you know here he tells about tongue out the godfrey and different wands actors in Hollywood that actually needed two to three psychiatrists a day now they making you laugh but they're miserable think about all of those ones out there in Hollywood amen they're entertaining you but why do they have to take drugs where are most of them drug addicts huh because that ink in this it doesn't matter if I make you happy what good is that gonna do me if I'm not happy myself well I need that in my heart I need the peace of God in my heart and let me say it like this don't you stop until the peace of God comes in your heart I don't care mama don't like it daddy don't like it sister don't like it brother don't like it children don't like it your soul is as safe oh you've gone crazy over this message I hope so you losing your mind I want my mind to be lost that I might gain the mind of Christ how they are startled you know when you're so in love you think why when I get married it's gonna be settled hey the devil got you all food it's the truth marriage has some good points to it but ain't goodness if you thirst for God your husband ain't gonna feel that Oh brothers if you thirst for God your wife won't feel that I don't care how good she is I don't care how good he is he'll never feel the place of God can I say it like this and so many people think when I get married the lust will stop you are so you just don't know do you it does not stop some of your brothers don't even come on he's always gonna say hey man y'all to know it it will not stop oh yeah y'all gotta be honest now you just got to be honest we're living to live I'm trying to get where I'm going cuz I'm taking too much time have any understanding darken some of the Gentiles walk in the vanity like Michael Jackson like a lot of these evangelistic old preachers fulfilling all their lust you know oh it's great to be don't y'all know that oh well you got your doctorate in the wrong with your doctorate as long as God is your dachi God is your number one you are right get as much education as you can but God must be number one he would did we be the head and not the tail he would that we be the Linda and not the Barra is that right it's okay brother sisters whatever these things are given to you for your pleasures in life but if we could all be like a joke no matter how rich God made him God was always number one how is number one as long as we can live right and do right before God God is always number one in our life God to give you whatever you want you said God I'd give you a million your give it to you if you are number he he's number one in your life I believe that but some of us scared to ask for that is that right it's the truth we rather work the lottery Lord I hope I can get him here you about that pray he said if you ask ask whatsoever you will is that the truth you you bother me and my word abide in you you could ask whatsoever you will and then be given to you that's the key a body in the word Oh help us Lord let me hurry hurry hurry hurry have any understanding doc Dokken being elevated from a life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart you see you know what we baptize seven times a day and if your heart is not right and it makes no difference you go down a wet Center and you come up you go down the drive center come up where the hive is you however they said my point is it no change is made it's your heart that God wants that's where the devil works it's your heart it's your heart with God can change your heart listen somebody said you know well uh let's put it this way if you knew I'll use your sisters because if you know man he's a millionaire and you want all that man hat you want what he you know you appreciate him but my point is when you marry him then you get everything he's got that's how it is with God when you married God you get everything he's got and whatever God has is yours right now we're looking at these things and we show off what brother Brooks uh well you know how could I do this thing now we have coming I'm gonna jump i'ma jump because I'm running out of time my point is this we are in a place that we cannot allow this world to distract us the Bible says in that day they will be eating drinking being married and giving in marriage they'll be having a lot of fun now understand nothing's wrong with eating and drinking and being married that's what we do and that's Christian sometimes that's all we know to do y'all know say we can't ain't nothing else much much of anything else we can do so my point is and there nothing wrong with that the thing that's wrong with it is when we try to let that eating and drinking me and being Mary feel that spot in our heart when we allow Satan to trick us and make the worldly things more important to us than the heavenly things then we are in trouble I'm trying to hurry I see a lot of y'all tired this morning but you know it's understand this when we get born again when we get quickened you know this word come to us oh we get so happy or praise the Lord hallelujah and you don't realize that's just the beginning the problem with most of us Christians here this morning is our neglection for example those of us who have flowers if you neglect to water those flowers what happened they died whenever you neglect to feed a living thing it dies the Holy Ghost is life if you neglect to read the word which is food and for the Holy Spirit it dies your experience die if you fail to pray it dies because these things you must know that once the Holy Ghost that baby in you is quickly that life is quickened you gotta feed it mamas you know that's the truth one of the things they meant that that that back in the day we went when they didn't have all the machines they look at a sister you know why she eating so much oh I don't know why I'm eating so much but I'm just craving some of these crazy things I ha right yeah if something got all in years there's a life going on in you that's craving something that you would normally wouldn't eat I'm still yet to see a lady eating a pickle with ice cream but she began to eat things in and stuff that she doesn't normally eat it's a different food and that's how it is with the world it must be you must see God you gotta feed him you must feed him otherwise your experience with window Oh y'all know what I mean how many of us have had glorious times and service amen and in everything and and instead of going and then final a word Amen that's gonna build that thing up we'll go home and you know Ohama didn't ever say you know you so tired he just just came from a revival and you wore out and he'll make you wore out for a whole week and you haven't prayed or fast at all or anything for a whole week and then that experience is gone see what you must understand is that Satan will lead you in a perverted way it is his job to mislead you it is his job to take your attention off of your experience it's his job to take your way Amen for that which just happened to you he is the provider he is the one that makes you think that this life is glorious think about it how many of us oh my goodness I need a vacation I need a vacation you're going to vacation and you still ain't happy huh you still no matter what you do it ain't going to satisfy that thing that's calling out to you don't quit people because the one experience don't stop get your experience every day if you can and we make you sense your living to live I'm fighting to live I'm gonna live hallelujah I didn't come into this life and meant to die and to die I came to live and you and I must recognize who we are where we came from and where we're going you are in the worst age ever he's always lana was bad Smyrna he compared to this age the saints in Smyrna could not handle this age hallelujah they knew what they were fighting but you and I we are fighting a lot of things huh first of all brother William said like this we cannot see our enemy he said but the enemy of this church is easy living it's the truth we got it so good we don't even have to flip switches from bow we got in the room now you don't even have to turn the water fountain oh it just all I said it you don't have to flush the commode easy living hallelujah it's gotten so bad you don't even have to use the key to get in the car that ain't nothing but yes it's easy hallelujah you don't even have to diagnose the Cardinal more the car diagnose yourself it's so easy and because of that the devil know it'll stop your prayer in a stop your prayer life you remember there's a time we needed to pray we wanted something from God we had to play it so bad nowadays you got everything handy for you now I remember the time in America everybody walked almost y'all don't know that time some of y'all don't know that time but everybody you know only right brother only a few people had cars maybe wasn't a few my house had a car now everybody got more than one two or three it's so funny it's so funny cuz even when I walked to the store from my house I feel strange you know cuz people look at you that's poor it's oh he's so sad it's sad to see that man walking and that is nothing but the truth we might be trying to get some exercise and you pull over says hey you wanna ride no I'm fine you see it's just the devil's working and he makes it so easy a manta you know we get sloth and praying we feel like you know I don't have too much that I need so we don't we don't pray we don't pray until God puts on put something desperate on us and probably God said is a shame that God has to do that to us they get us to pray I'm almost done I ever have to cut it short but something I love David this is my songs this is one of my favorite songs Psalms 42 one through seven and here David says as the heart panted after the water Brooks old pan at my soul after thee O God my soul thirsts for God for the Living God when shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night why are they continually saying to me where is thy God when I remember these things I poured out my soul in me I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise and the multitude that kept holy days you see what he's saying I was a part of the church I went there and we sung in the blood of Christ my lord right we did all of that hallelujah I enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I enter his coat with pray he said we did all of that ah we'd be strong we had a good time a multitude of people y'all know what I'm talking about you got a great crowd it feels good hallelujah but at the end of the day you still feel that more I need more God at the end of it all you don't feel changed Oh somebody help me at the end of the day you still feel that loneliness you feel that emptiness you know God I know this is truth I know that it's right but you know what the church has become we've become a church that is powerless and the reason why we're power that's because we don't have the powerful and there's only one powerful and that's Jesus Christ himself and we're not to rest and wait on everybody else every man is for himself you've got to be safe when it comes down amen to your death Edmund was come down the crossing over the river you're not gonna be joining hands with folks and said praise God we're on our way out of here now you are going to be all alone and the thing about it is that all of your life will flash before you you go to know hmm those times when the Holy Ghost tried to get you to pray and you said I'll do it later praying for the Holy Ghost is not like washing dishes you can wash those dishes later if that's what you need to do but when it when an unction comes on you to pray you need to pray oh well I got all my friends my momma used to say I'll see y'all later and she'd go behind that door go in the bathroom of wherever and she would pray now my mother was an ignorant woman she could not read or write but she knew the voice of God and didn't make it a different what kind of crowd she had in the house when it came to her the praise she left that crowd and she went behind the door somewhere inside to pray my god make me God anoint me with that but when you neglect the thirst that God has placed in you or you place it trying to feel it with someone else or something else it ain't gonna work and after a while that thirst is going to die why I'm almost done remember the man the dog was barking going back there that dog was barking bop that old miner says well I don't need you no more you've been a good friend but I don't need you no more tomorrow I'm gonna be a millionaire and he took his rifle and boom he shot the dog and killed the dog and the whole time the dog was trying to tell him there was somebody outside somebody that's going to kill you somebody that is the danger to you is that right that's how the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is that laws in you telling you you need to be saved you need to be changed there's got to be a change in you you're not there yet though you'll be a Christian if you want to make a rapture you got to go further you cannot be this way and make a rapture I'm not saying when I say there many of us are saved but if we don't come into the full statue of Christ you will not make a rapture I'm telling you those are the ones that will make a rapture and the problem with us is that we're too busy and we're hushing God's call like I told the brother this morning I said thing here we we lean too much on grace Oh grace is gonna lead me on grace trying to lead you on by telling you you ain't their way you are you're not in the place you ought to be oh I can get mad no praise God I can tell you all about what I need to say to you let me tell you something you better get on your knees you're not there yet ain't gonna be no fussing and fighting in heaven hallelujah you still watching ungodly stuff you're not there yet you can't turn your head the right way when you see a naked person walking down the street you're not there yet I'm not saying you're not born comes in that you need to be a full maturity individual in Christ and these verses of Christ must be in you because no church this meant oh I follow this message that ain't gonna do you no good you can believe it believe it but you got to be born again this nature can go there it cannot the Bible said flesh and blood would not inherit the kingdom of God it can it but there is something that will he told what he told Nicodemus you must be born again that which is flesh is flesh that which experience period hallelujah and we've been born of the flesh now we need to be born of the Spirit of God hallelujah you love the Lord Oh imma cut it short you got to fight the good fight of faith lay ahold of eternal life you said what do you mean I'm saying this you got to be like Joshua you got to have a spirit like I'm gonna conquer everything God said I was gonna conquer he said Joshua this land is yours I'm gonna say Joshua this land is yours this Garlin is this divine nature that Peter talked about is yours but you gotta fight for every inch of it mmm you gotta fight for it it's not gonna drop in your lap and sometimes I remember when I was in the Apostolic Church years and years ago and you know what I let them break me let me say like this I was telling a lot I was confessing to the Lord asking for his forgiveness I said Lord I walked by myself even then I prayed and I fasted I had a prayer life of three times a day 6:00 in the morning 12:00 noon and 6:00 at night and I got so much criticism because I didn't run to the places and did the things that everybody all you think you holier than now you you think you hold you do you know they criticize me but you know what God was trying to bill me even then but I wanted friends so in all to gain friends I had to compromise hello we've all done it some way or another and you compromise Amen for friendship and then you lose it's God's friendship because the Bible says you cannot be a friend of a world and a friend of God's - so when we become friends of the world we becomes an enemy to God hello you may not like this kind but let me tell you like these people of God we're trying to bring us all to a place where we can take a rapture I'm not interested in religion I don't care about what other people are doing I know that one thing for certain as a pastor of this church I will have to give an account for every soul here hello and my thought my thought my thought amen if the love of God would have been on display like it should have been and should be maybe some of the ones we've lost won't be would not be going already if anybody is being blamed I'm to blame you understand me my point is some of y'all may not you know you're sitting all already on the edge of things you don't even see that you're sitting on the end but you are spiritually every one of us Amen need a refueling more of God right because we need we people got a plane Andy you know it's going to be a few now you've got to determine you got to say in your mind who you are and what you've come to accomplish Jesus self as a man says foxes have holes and birds have nests but the Son of man have no place to lay his head he was willing to sacrifice his entire life let me give you a good scenario if God would say I can give you a million years of life but after that million years of life of good life I'm gonna send you to hell and he says listen but I give you a hundred years of trials and temptations hardships whew and after that hundred years of hardships I give you eternal life only a fool only a fool would choose the million years of good life and the rest of your life in hell give me a hundred years however long I got to live on this earth let it be as bad as it can be as long as my station is eternal with God hallelujah because suffering is something you and I can't get out of it is what it is but I rather suffer for righteousness sake then the suffer for evil you understand me every soul every soul is crying because you know and I know nobody religion is gonna satisfy you it's always something on the inside calling out for the Living God you got to go beyond all of that to find God lest an but don't hush the call don't stop the from barking because that's your safety that's so telling you you not quite where you ought to be and if you should die what's going to happen to you next hmm you think about all these people that's dying all these great politicians and all and I don't know who they were and whether they were Christians or not but if they didn't know the Lord Jesus Christ they are where they are and all I can say is that people of God obey you and I know by God's grace there's only one way to be saved those who are in Christ think about it as Christ knew what he was getting into he suffered for you he died for you he bled for you he did all of that he knew what he was getting into the pain and agony he went through and then for us to say it wasn't good enough to walk away says Lord your pardon wasn't good enough what you did wasn't good enough I did all this for you and think about his attitude toward you when you reject the way of eternal life I'd rather be a fool and I've been called a fool for a long time my family still think I'm crazy to this day and they say oh we believe in Jesus but all of that ain't necessary it's all necessary Strait is the gate narrow is the way that leads to eternal life and only a few be that find it that means you got to look for it you got to hunt for it that's why when that thirst is in you they may not have you how many other and I'm closing how many of us of us have ever been really thirsty when you thirsty a Pepsi ain't gonna do you gonna get you some water after the Pepsi cuz there's only one thing that can really satisfy the thirst of man and that's God's nature water it's God's nature pop and that's called water y'all know it's the truth sometimes I've done it before I said okay give me your honor promenade with my drinking and you know what's good with the food but then after a while I gotta have that water right get that water when the water strike is that all that's it and I really should never have gotten that I should've just stayed with the water it made my food taste even better so what I'm trying to say people all of these experiences those sweet things out there all of the kinds of religions you got out there everybody think they right there's only one way and that's the way that Jesus Christ left and I tell you what I know I know for myself I seen so much stuff a man coming up as a Christian coming up in a Christian home with my mother trying to explain to me the ways of Christ I had all of that but you know what what she had couldn't satisfy me it just made me more thirsty and perhaps our lives one day will will make others thirsty but you got to live it you can't make a person thirsty and not living it I know some German friends because of the life that God allowed me to live before them they're now saying they used to be in a great denominational churches and everything else I remember one I had done left that job and I saw in the street and she come up with her German accent I love that accent she said look I'm saying now I'm no longer powder and gonna call that organization I'm no not a part of that and look at me I'm growing my hair and the whole time I didn't even realize I was affecting them didn't know that my life was affecting them in that way but had I not lived it before then it wasn't me like Paul said it's not I that live as Christ in me people of God you don't have to talk to me but we're gonna take this moment right now all of us we're gonna bow our heads and we want to talk to the Lord Jesus let's bow Heavenly Father God we come before you lord we thank you for your grace in your mercy hallelujah father you've been so good to us Lord as a pastor of the church here lord I need more of you Lord I need you to help me go higher I need greater victories in my life Lord Lord I'm so ashamed oh god of the way I carry on sometime father's not just being a preacher in the pulpit but as being a preacher in the street as well and father God I realized Lord we all come short of your glory but Lord God I don't want to be a man that just gonna say grace is gonna see me through with no effort of living it help us Lord Jesus give us grace Lord let that that that call don't let it go dear Manos Lord don't let it stop Lord don't let us kill it but father hallelujah may we listen to your Holy Spirit as it pulls on our spirit as it calls for us Lord to come closer to come closer to come closer Lord it is our desire to make a rapture Lord not to be a part of some kind of system but Lord a part of your body there's only one way that we can be a part of your body law and that is by one baptism and that baptism is by the Holy Spirit help us now Lord Jesus that we become better Christians Lord God not just living morally but Lord allowing your nature to live through us many people live morally clean animals being cleaner than most men but father we want to be holy holy holy holy unto the law and father I pray that you wouldn't feel us indwell us with your Holy Spirit so much so long we'll be just like your father give us grace to overcome this evil age Oh God give us victory over the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life they would be nothing Lord so that we could be something in your kingdom granted here this morning all of the hearts of our Lord and I know you here I cry we pray father God answering to your call Lord respond because there is a deep call to the deep we're looking for you long we're depending on you to bring perfection in our lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray there anybodys our prayer I can feel its mighty power and it's great [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I can feel it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] - brother rich passes the Thais and Yaya [Music] [Applause] [Music] 100 he's my guard up and make me whoa oh [Music] my god whoo I lift it up man quaint mr. sting oh my soul Oh bread of heaven feed me till I want no more oh he is my god fill it up and make me whole once again even who feel my blue [Music] man quench me as brother Eugene came up to ask but those who would want to pray for Chicago Rehana special prayer meeting for her of last Thursday I guess some of you all didn't get the announcement but for those who would want to linger after service just for five you can still pray for her again you can't get to you can't get enough friend and so with that being on his heart still we can we can break we we believe with all of our heart that God is doing something that we don't understand because we realize that Satan cannot attack except you get permission from God and some of you all don't know but
