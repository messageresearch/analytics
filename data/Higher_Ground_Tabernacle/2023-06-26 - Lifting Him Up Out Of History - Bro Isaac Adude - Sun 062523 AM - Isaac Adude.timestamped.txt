[59:44] out of History
[1:00:04] amen stories from the Bible
[1:00:07] and by God's grace apply it to uh you
[1:00:11] know another place in the Bible where it
[1:00:12] happened afterwards
[1:00:16] amen here the Bible is talking about uh
[1:00:20] uh uh Jehoshaphat when he was invaded by
[1:00:23] the children of Moab and the ammonite
[1:00:27] um
[1:00:32] if you read the entire chapter you'll
[1:00:35] notice you'll understand that
[1:00:36] Jehoshaphat had no might or strength
[1:00:42] amen he couldn't fight them he couldn't
[1:00:44] face them and fight and overcome their
[1:00:46] battle
[1:00:49] amen amen he was afraid because he
[1:00:52] didn't know what to do
[1:00:54] a fair amen but he remembered that he
[1:00:57] served to God
[1:00:59] a man who his specialty it's in
[1:01:02] difficult times
[1:01:04] a man who says that come unto me when
[1:01:08] you are you know tired and When Trials
[1:01:10] are
[1:01:11] more lost
[1:01:14] amen so he went to God and started to
[1:01:17] remind God of his promises
[1:01:21] start to remind him of his promises
[1:01:25] he says that you are the god of our
[1:01:28] fathers
[1:01:29] you are the God in heaven
[1:01:32] you are the God who rules over the
[1:01:34] entire Earth
[1:01:37] they are the God who rules over the even
[1:01:40] over the kingdoms of the heathens
[1:01:44] and you are The God Who made everything
[1:01:47] by your name
[1:01:50] amen everything except everything uh
[1:01:52] everything was made by you and for you
[1:01:56] and so he knew that by himself he
[1:01:59] couldn't overcome
[1:02:02] he knew that about his own strength he
[1:02:04] couldn't do anything
[1:02:07] amen so he had to go call on that God of
[1:02:10] History
[1:02:12] amen he had to lift God from the history
[1:02:16] he had to lift him up out of History
[1:02:20] to bring him to bring God in his
[1:02:23] presence circumstances
[1:02:26] to lift him up out of History
[1:02:28] he meant to bring him up to bring him up
[1:02:31] to his uh present situation
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:36] amen this reminds me of of Jacob
[1:02:41] amen when when Issa was uh pursuing
[1:02:44] Jacob and he wanted to kill him
[1:02:56] had many more people than Jacob he is
[1:03:02] outnumbered
[1:03:04] amen he tried to divide his uh uh his
[1:03:08] people into three different different uh
[1:03:10] sections
[1:03:11] on purpose
[1:03:14] but he found out that that couldn't work
[1:03:17] and the only solution was to go back to
[1:03:20] God
[1:03:22] Amen the only solution was to go back to
[1:03:25] God
[1:03:26] Amen and ask him for his help
[1:03:29] amen the only solution was to go talk to
[1:03:32] God
[1:03:34] to tell him about the situation
[1:03:37] you tell him about the problem
[1:03:40] to tell him about his brother who was
[1:03:42] coming to kill him
[1:03:46] the Bible says that it's a was coming
[1:03:48] was determined to kill Jacob now
[1:03:53] after Jacob had that meeting with God
[1:03:59] after Jacob had that conference with God
[1:04:04] Amen the Bible says that God did not
[1:04:07] only give him the power to overcome
[1:04:12] amen but God even changed the heart of
[1:04:15] his brother
[1:04:18] amen his brother who came to kill him
[1:04:22] and his brother who was determined to
[1:04:25] kill him no matter what
[1:04:28] amen but when the Met they started to
[1:04:30] hug they started hugging
[1:04:34] amen and during that conference Jacob's
[1:04:37] name was changed in his life as well
[1:04:42] amen because he knew where to go
[1:05:01] his hands are open foreign
[1:05:19] even here you'll see that uh uh
[1:05:22] uh the story the story of uh Hezekiah
[1:05:29] it is

[1:07:33] Ivan us
[1:07:40] amen he kept on telling him about the
[1:07:43] stories of how he defied other gods
[1:07:49] amen he came to uh Hezekiah telling him
[1:07:52] that but don't let your God fool you
[1:07:54] living here
[1:07:57] amen look at what my father has done to
[1:08:00] these gods that so-called God that you
[1:08:02] know
[1:08:04] amen he destroyed this King he destroyed
[1:08:07] that King and he started naming Kings
[1:08:09] after Kings
[1:08:12] he started bragging about about his
[1:08:15] power and how he was overcoming and how
[1:08:18] he was trying to go strong
[1:08:22] amen amen he started telling those
[1:08:24] things
[1:08:28] amen he told them he told him that don't
[1:08:30] let your God fool you don't let your God
[1:08:32] I'll give you give you a false hope that
[1:08:34] he would deliver you from us
[1:08:40] amen this is exactly what the devil does
[1:08:44] Amen when the devil will come to you it
[1:08:46] will always show you things that he has
[1:08:48] done
[1:08:51] he will tell you that this brother had
[1:08:53] cancer and he passed away this brother
[1:08:55] had diabetes and that killed him this
[1:08:57] brother had this and that and that and
[1:08:59] this is
[1:09:04] amen he will always show you negative
[1:09:06] stuff he will always show you trying to
[1:09:08] uh make you doubt God
[1:09:13] Amen he will always try to make you show
[1:09:16] you things that are hard to overcome so
[1:09:18] that you can uh uh you can lose your
[1:09:21] faith in God
[1:09:26] Amen he will say that this brother or
[1:09:29] sister went through the exact same thing
[1:09:31] but this is result that he lost at the
[1:09:34] end of the day
[1:09:39] amen this sister was bearing for you for
[1:09:42] her entire life she came to church every
[1:09:44] day praying and she had no results
[1:09:50] that's the work of the devil
[1:09:53] amen he will always try to show you
[1:09:56] these examples
[1:09:59] trying to discourage your faith
[1:10:03] he will always try to show you how
[1:10:05] impossible it is to overcome
[1:10:08] amen the same thing as sneaker it was
[1:10:11] showing to Hezekiah
[1:10:15] telling him about how he destroyed all
[1:10:17] the other kings
[1:10:20] by one he didn't know
[1:10:22] amen but the the gods that he destroyed
[1:10:26] amen was the word different than the god
[1:10:29] of Hezekiah
[1:10:58] he was serving a God who was powerful
[1:11:01] enough just with the single word to
[1:11:03] destroy himself
[1:11:07] was facing another God
[1:11:10] Amen a God that was different than the
[1:11:13] gods that he fought before
[1:11:15] amen came across somebody who trusted
[1:11:19] God
[1:11:21] and and physical amen he came across
[1:11:25] somebody who knew the God that he was
[1:11:27] serving if it's the first amen
[1:11:33] face he was facing a man who knew the
[1:11:36] type of God he was serving visit us
[1:11:40] it's the same thing like with Goliath
[1:11:43] yeah man I'm pretty sure that Goliath
[1:11:45] had to overcome so many battles
[1:11:49] I'm pretty sure that Goliath had to
[1:11:51] fight so many battles and he overcame
[1:11:55] amen he destroyed you know single
[1:11:58] destroying armies with his single hands
[1:12:02] amen he destroys cities and kings and
[1:12:05] kingdoms by himself
[1:12:08] by this time it was different
[1:12:12] amen this time it was different
[1:12:14] amen because he was facing David
[1:12:18] amen who wasn't like the others
[1:12:21] he was facing David
[1:12:24] amen who knew exactly the kind of God he
[1:12:27] was serving
[1:12:29] he was facing David
[1:12:32] who knew that God will always be with
[1:12:34] him
[1:12:36] and he was facing David
[1:12:39] Yemen who knew that God gave him a
[1:12:42] promise
[1:12:43] amen that he will be the king
[1:12:46] and he will never die unless he become
[1:12:49] the he becomes a king
[1:12:54] amen he will never die before before
[1:12:57] that promise to come to pass
[1:13:04] amen so that's the reason why when
[1:13:06] Goliath came to him
[1:13:09] my David Was Not Afraid amen because he
[1:13:13] was trusting God Amen because he was
[1:13:16] believing in God
[1:13:18] Amen because he knew that God will fight
[1:13:20] his battle
[1:13:22] because he knew that God gave him a
[1:13:25] promise
[1:13:26] amen that he will always fight his
[1:13:28] battles
[1:13:30] amen so Hezekiah was facing that same
[1:13:33] situation
[1:13:34] statement amen he was facing the a king
[1:13:37] amen amen somebody who was stronger than
[1:13:39] him
[1:13:41] he couldn't fight with his own mind
[1:13:45] so here's the car I had to go back to
[1:13:48] God
[1:13:50] I had to go back to the Rock
[1:13:52] hey man Hezekiah had to run to God Amen
[1:13:57] he had to have a conference with God he
[1:14:00] may talk to him about the circum about
[1:14:02] his circumstances
[1:14:04] women talk to him about his present
[1:14:06] situation
[1:14:07] amen talk to him about the trial that he
[1:14:10] was facing
[1:14:12] amen so verse 14 the Bible says that and
[1:14:15] Hezekiah received the letter of the hand
[1:14:18] of the mess of the messenger messenger
[1:14:20] and read it and Hezekiah went up into
[1:14:23] the house of the Lord and spread it
[1:14:25] before the Lord
[1:14:43] from you know other uh uh countries or
[1:14:46] armies to come and join him
[1:14:51] amen but the Bible says that once the
[1:14:54] sins
[1:14:55] once you receive that letter
[1:14:58] amen he went straight to God
[1:15:01] Amen once you receive the letter
[1:15:04] amen he went straight to his creators
[1:15:07] amen verse 15 the Bible says Hezekiah
[1:15:10] prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord
[1:15:13] God of Israel which dwells between the
[1:15:16] cherubims Thou Art the god even thou
[1:15:19] alone of all the kingdoms of the earth
[1:15:21] thou has made Heaven and Earth
[1:15:33] Lord bow down thine ears and hear open
[1:15:37] lower than eyes and see and hear the
[1:15:40] words of of Seneca which has sent him to
[1:15:45] reproach the Living God
[1:15:56] of the truth Lord the kings of Assyria
[1:16:00] have destroyed I have destroyed the
[1:16:03] nations of the and their lands
[1:16:09] a man and have cast their gods Into the
[1:16:12] Fire for they were now God
[1:16:15] but the work of man's hand wood and
[1:16:18] stone therefore they have destroyed
[1:16:20] themselves
[1:16:27] now therefore O Lord Our God I beseech
[1:16:31] thee save thou Arts out of his hand they
[1:16:35] are all the kingdoms of the earth may
[1:16:37] know that thou art the Lord God even
[1:16:40] there only
[1:16:49] amen he went to Ghana started stating
[1:16:52] those facts
[1:16:54] lord it's true that he has done this
[1:16:58] lord it's true that he has destroyed all
[1:17:00] the these Gods
[1:17:03] but the difference is
[1:17:05] those gods were created by men
[1:17:09] those guys are the work of wood and
[1:17:12] stone
[1:17:13] look love
[1:17:28] and he came to pass that and he came to
[1:17:32] pass that night that the angel of the
[1:17:34] Lord went out and smote in the camp of
[1:17:37] us of the Assyrians and 104 score and
[1:17:41] five thousand and went the rose early in
[1:17:44] the morning behold they were all dead
[1:17:46] corpses Sydney is
[1:17:58] amen because if you read if you read in
[1:18:01] uh verse 34 before that
[1:18:04] the Bible says that this is God talking
[1:18:07] he said that for our defend the city
[1:18:10] to save it
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:19:02] but today the people
[1:19:06] if they don't get everything they asked
[1:19:09] foreign
[1:19:21] but what we need is men and women today
[1:19:30] men and women who are determined to Hold
[1:19:33] On Foreign
[1:20:28] your strength from walking from place to
[1:20:31] place
[1:20:35] you've been to this church and you went
[1:20:37] to the other church
[1:20:41] you've been to this pasture and you go
[1:20:43] back to the other pastors
[1:20:46] amen but you still can't find relief
[1:20:49] but there is still a God that answers
[1:20:52] prayers
[1:20:54] amen there is still a God that saves
[1:20:56] from sin
[1:20:58] amen if you prayed amen and the answer
[1:21:02] seems like it's taking too long
[1:21:04] amen keep believing human God is looking
[1:21:08] for these people
[1:21:10] amen who will not take no foreign
[1:21:25] promise of God
[1:21:27] no matter how difficult the situation is
[1:21:31] no matter how hard the situation is
[1:21:36] no matter how impossible it looks like
[1:21:39] they have made up their minds are made
[1:21:42] up
[1:21:44] they're not turning back
[1:21:47] amen their minds are made up Hello amen
[1:21:50] they keep moving forward
[1:21:52] amen they keep going ahead
[1:21:55] amen they keep shouting the victory
[1:21:58] it doesn't matter how long it's taking
[1:22:01] it's like Abraham amen God gave him a
[1:22:05] promise
[1:22:06] 24 years after amen Abraham most kept
[1:22:10] shouting the victory
[1:22:13] praising God Amen Abraham most keep
[1:22:17] thanking God because you knew that God
[1:22:20] would give him that promise
[1:22:22] he was the same God who will fulfill it
[1:22:56] these are the kind of people that God is
[1:22:58] looking for amen these are the kind of
[1:23:01] Believers that God is looking
[1:23:03] that's the kind of the church that God
[1:23:06] is looking for
[1:23:07] a church that would take him in this
[1:23:10] world
[1:23:10] the church that will lift him up of
[1:23:13] history
[1:23:14] that will stand there and remind god of
[1:23:17] what he has done before
[1:23:20] amen a church that will bring that will
[1:23:23] call God to the sin
[1:23:40] [Music]

[1:24:41] this and you go away
[1:24:43] it's all good I'm not saying that there
[1:24:46] is nothing wrong with it
[1:24:48] but as long as you remember if you don't
[1:24:50] have faith inside of you
[1:24:52] I mean it doesn't matter what that
[1:24:55] person can do
[1:24:56] when he takes the faith inside of you
[1:25:01] when it takes the faith inside of you to
[1:25:03] see God in action
[1:25:06] that's why you see the prophets
[1:25:10] young lady coming to the prayer line
[1:25:15] had to let her sit
[1:25:17] let's see sit on the chairs
[1:25:21] and watch what God was doing
[1:25:25] man what was that for is it the amen it
[1:25:28] was bringing her face up

[1:25:34] faith

[1:25:40] for the others
[1:25:42] and to have the faith that what he's
[1:25:45] doing for the others he can do it for me
[1:25:48] amen and once once she got to that point
[1:25:51] that she knew it she realized that God
[1:25:53] is still the same God for them and for
[1:25:54] her
[1:25:59] amen the prophet turned and said that

[1:26:36] have mercy on me
[1:26:39] amen it wasn't the Cry of that blind man
[1:26:42] that stopped Jesus
[1:26:46] because Jesus was wherever Jesus was
[1:26:49] going people were making noises
[1:26:53] amen and Jesus was surrounded with
[1:26:55] people who wanted to touch him was
[1:26:57] talking to him was shouting and singing
[1:26:59] and all them
[1:27:04] there is no way that the Cry of their
[1:27:07] men will go to Jesus years
[1:27:12] amen but what Jesus heard was not only
[1:27:15] the cry
[1:27:17] amen but Jesus heard the faith of that
[1:27:20] the first that was going behind that
[1:27:21] Christ
[1:27:24] faith that God to Jesus see they said
[1:27:27] foreign
[1:29:23] just have faith behind Departed

[1:32:04] same Jordan River
[1:32:08] when he had to cross that same river

[1:42:50] God was leading His prophets
[1:42:54] amen God was guiding His prophets
[1:42:57] wild foreign
[1:43:35] foreign
[1:44:35] she felt the deep that was calling to
[1:44:38] another dude
[1:44:40] I mean when the prophet went to her
[1:44:42] house
[1:44:44] amen the prophet said that their house
[1:44:46] had the sweet spirit that he has never
[1:44:48] seen
[1:44:50] is
[1:44:55] once you started praying
[1:44:58] amen he was the most honest answer among
[1:45:01] the most with the most honest prayer
[1:45:03] that he has ever heard
[1:45:06] she left God out of History
[1:45:10] amen she called God out of history
[1:45:19] and God showed up a juicy manifestation
[1:45:22] amen and that God is still the same God
[1:45:24] today is
[1:45:26] amen whatever situation you're going
[1:45:29] through
[1:45:31] call unto God
[1:45:34] he will show up in
[1:45:51] knowing that people will make fun of him
[1:45:55] amen his disciple even tried to stop him
[1:45:58] from going to that place
[1:46:00] amen because he knew that Simon was
[1:46:03] calling him not to not to welcome him
[1:46:05] but to make him uh to ridiculous
[1:46:09] Amen to make fun of him amen but God who
[1:46:14] knows everything
[1:46:15] amen he knows everything before they
[1:46:18] even happen
[1:46:19] knowing what Simon would do to him amen
[1:46:23] but no matter what he showed up
[1:46:26] amen because somebody called him amen
[1:46:30] because somebody invited him to his
[1:46:32] house amen God still showed up Jews amen
[1:46:36] because God didn't want to give us a
[1:46:38] reason to say that someone called you
[1:46:40] and you didn't show up
[1:46:42] amen so no matter who you are amen you
[1:46:46] can call unto God now
[1:46:48] and God will always show up amen you can
[1:46:52] call unto God now amen and God will
[1:46:55] always be there amen because he always
[1:46:58] shows up to his uh appointment
[1:47:02] but you have the benefit of that of it
[1:47:05] of his presence
[1:47:08] amen it depends on your attitude
[1:47:10] am I noticed that Simon called Jesus
[1:47:16] to his house
[1:47:19] Jesus was there
[1:47:21] Jesus showed up
[1:47:23] then he put Jesus in the corner
[1:47:27] amen he didn't receive the blessing that
[1:47:30] comes with Jesus presence
[1:47:33] amen he didn't receive the blessings
[1:47:35] that comes with his presence
[1:47:38] because wherever Jesus goes
[1:47:42] amen he always bring his blessings with
[1:47:44] him
[1:47:45] amen wherever he goes
[1:47:48] he always bring blessings with him he
[1:47:52] may notice when when he sent his
[1:47:53] disciples the first time he sent his
[1:47:55] disciples to go preach
[1:47:59] on people's doors
[1:48:01] amen those who will welcome you
[1:48:05] bless them but those who will not
[1:48:09] welcome
[1:48:10] walk away
[1:48:12] um
[1:48:16] because wherever he goes he always has
[1:48:18] his blessings
[1:48:20] but for you to receive those blessings
[1:48:25] amen you have to take care of him
[1:48:28] you have to give him the first place
[1:48:31] you have to wash his feet amen
[1:48:35] to his anoint his feet
[1:48:38] amen you have to take care of him
[1:48:41] so that's why the blessings I was
[1:48:44] supposed to go to Simon what happened
[1:48:52] amen who took care of Jesus
[1:48:55] Amen Jesus always show up
[1:48:59] Amen in the morning when we come to
[1:49:01] church
[1:49:02] we say Lord come here we say Lord we
[1:49:06] need you Lord we want you to be in our
[1:49:10] meets
[1:49:12] amen that's everybody's prayer amen one
[1:49:15] week before we left the house when we go
[1:49:17] to church we say we go to church to meet
[1:49:19] God
[1:49:21] Amen he's always the first person to go
[1:49:24] to an event
[1:49:27] amen God is here even right now
[1:49:30] amen but the blessings that you will
[1:49:32] received amen he depends on how much you
[1:49:36] will care for him
[1:49:38] amen the blessings that you will
[1:49:40] received amen he depends on your
[1:49:43] treatment
[1:49:44] it depends on how you will take care of
[1:49:47] him
[1:49:48] the blessings that you will received
[1:49:51] amen he depends on how you will take
[1:49:53] care of God
[1:49:54] Amen that's why the prophet said that he
[1:49:58] has never seen somebody going to Calvary
[1:50:01] and coming back the same amen because
[1:50:04] when you go to God's presence
[1:50:07] amen you will never come back
[1:50:09] something inside of you has to change
[1:50:13] the transformation that happens yeah
[1:50:16] there is a transformation that takes
[1:50:18] place
[1:50:21] man he's never been with Jesus before
[1:50:24] you know
[1:50:25] he's never he'll hurt Jesus preaching
[1:50:28] amen he was there determined to kill his
[1:50:31] disciples
[1:50:35] but when you went to that conference
[1:50:37] with God
[1:50:38] when you went to Calvary he may want the
[1:50:42] pillar of fire showed up like around the
[1:50:45] full City
[1:50:47] I mean it was another person
[1:50:54] to send his Prophet
[1:50:57] she knew that God will always always
[1:51:00] show up to his appointment
[1:51:04] so every time you call God
[1:51:08] always shows up
[1:51:10] there is a story that the prophet told
[1:51:13] once I don't know if it's also in the
[1:51:14] Bible
[1:51:16] amen of this family is it for me amen
[1:51:19] the husband and wife
[1:51:21] amen they prayed God they said Lord we
[1:51:24] invite you in our house
[1:51:27] Lord we want you to come and feast with
[1:51:30] us
[1:51:31] amen they made that prayer amen
[1:51:35] everything perfectly fine
[1:51:38] he meant to set the table they said Lord
[1:51:40] this time we want you Lord to show up
[1:51:44] amen they made the food they were
[1:51:46] expecting God to come and eat with him
[1:51:50] right at that time where they were
[1:51:52] expecting God to show up
[1:51:54] they heard somebody knocking at the door
[1:51:59] somebody knocking at the door
[1:52:01] the husband told his wife well what time
[1:52:04] is it's 2 p.m oh we call God at 2 p.m
[1:52:06] believe that's God
[1:52:09] okay I'm gonna go and open the door
[1:52:12] that's got nothing
[1:52:14] because we're not expecting anybody else
[1:52:18] so he went and opened the door and he
[1:52:22] saw a homeless guy he left
[1:52:24] coming and asking for food
[1:52:28] amen that guy was so generous he took
[1:52:31] some of the food and then he gave to
[1:52:33] that man
[1:52:35] well
[1:52:38] since it's late let me go and call him
[1:52:41] and to ask him to bring back to come
[1:52:43] back and eat the rest of the food
[1:52:47] so when you open the door he didn't he
[1:52:49] couldn't find that man anymore he didn't
[1:52:51] know where he went
[1:52:54] um
[1:52:58] so at the end of the night before the
[1:53:01] day went on and God did not show up
[1:53:03] because they were expecting a certain
[1:53:04] type of God and he didn't show up Allah
[1:53:09] they had their own image of God how God
[1:53:12] will be and that God did not show up
[1:53:17] amen so they want to pray a night they
[1:53:19] say Lord who prayed and we cooked and
[1:53:21] everything we're expecting you to come
[1:53:23] and you did not show up
[1:53:28] amen and God answered back to him I
[1:53:31] think in a dream and he said
[1:53:33] yes I was there
[1:53:35] when you called me I was there I showed
[1:53:38] up those foreign
[1:54:39] but we always have to know one thing
[1:54:41] that God will be there
[1:54:44] that's the most important thing that we
[1:54:46] have to know
[1:54:47] that will be there how is it gonna be
[1:54:51] there I don't know
[1:54:53] when is it gonna show up I don't know
[1:54:56] but I know one thing for sure
[1:55:01] even it doesn't matter how long it took
[1:55:04] it doesn't matter how long this will
[1:55:07] take
[1:55:08] oh no God will show up you may the
[1:55:11] prophet says here you Prophet to do DC
[1:55:14] now what started it okay
[1:55:17] amen talking about Eve
[1:55:20] amen he says that reasoning he says that
[1:55:23] faith has no reason
[1:55:30] you don't reason at all
[1:55:33] but you believe
[1:55:36] when you prayed for when you are prayed
[1:55:39] for
[1:55:40] and accept God's word for healing
[1:55:46] the only reason with your feelings
[1:55:49] don't reason with nothing else
[1:55:52] there is no reasoning to it
[1:56:00] in a minute that you reason
[1:56:03] on God's word
[1:56:06] then you're losing faith see
[1:56:11] don't have no yes nose maybe so
[1:56:16] we know
[1:56:18] stay right with it
[1:56:20] see if had the right approach
[1:56:25] correct amen because she was quoting to
[1:56:27] the serpent the word
[1:56:31] but she listened to his reasoning
[1:56:36] there is just so many people today that
[1:56:39] has the right knowledge
[1:56:44] that knows that this word shall be God's
[1:56:47] word
[1:56:50] and it's God's word
[1:56:52] by the stand
[1:56:55] and let some people reason them out of
[1:56:58] it is
[1:57:08] away from the things of God
[1:57:11] reasonings
[1:57:15] we have to cast them down
[1:57:19] once you start reasoning with the word
[1:57:21] of God
[1:57:24] that's when you lose your faith
[1:57:27] that's when you start losing your face
[1:57:31] don't reason with the word of God
[1:57:34] God gives you the word
[1:57:37] God gave you the promise
[1:57:39] you just have faith
[1:57:42] images
[1:57:59] because you don't know the relationship
[1:58:02] that you have between they don't know
[1:58:03] the relationship between you and your
[1:58:05] God
[1:58:07] they don't know what God told you
[1:58:10] amen so therefore I don't have to tell
[1:58:12] you how this is gonna happen
[1:58:15] amen the only thing that I can tell you
[1:58:19] is to wait and see see that Tundra amen
[1:58:22] you would know it when it will happen
[1:58:24] because I will come back to you and tell
[1:58:27] you the testimony
[1:58:29] amen so it doesn't matter how this is
[1:58:31] gonna happen
[1:58:33] I'm telling you how are you gonna get
[1:58:35] out of that bed
[1:58:38] I don't know God gave me the promise
[1:58:42] amen God said that he's my healer amen
[1:58:46] he will come and heal me amen how are
[1:58:49] you gonna get out of that situation
[1:58:51] I don't know amen it's not my job to
[1:58:55] find out how
[1:58:56] amen but I know one thing for sure amen
[1:59:00] I have prayed amen I have asked God Amen
[1:59:04] God gave me his promise
[1:59:08] amen so I will be waiting on him amen I
[1:59:12] will be there waiting amen until God
[1:59:15] shows up
[1:59:16] how are you going to how are you gonna
[1:59:18] bring your sons back back or your family
[1:59:20] back to the faith
[1:59:23] I don't know it's not mine to find out
[1:59:27] the Bible told me one thing amen have
[1:59:31] faith for you and your family
[1:59:34] have faith
[1:59:36] and you will be saved you and your
[1:59:38] family
[1:59:39] amen that's the only thing I care about
[1:59:41] see that socialism
[1:59:44] and God will save me and my family
[1:59:48] amen how are you going to find a new job
[1:59:53] amen one thing I know for sure amen the
[1:59:57] Bible says that God takes care of the
[1:59:58] little birds
[2:00:00] and he promised that he will take care
[2:00:03] of me
[2:00:04] that's the only thing I care about is
[2:00:07] the promises
[2:00:10] the only thing important to me
[2:00:12] to find out a promise
[2:00:16] faith in it
[2:00:19] foreign
[2:00:58] a man without character can't Reign
[2:01:00] because power apart from character is
[2:01:03] satanic an enormous song
[2:01:07] characters
[2:01:15] amen and since
[2:01:17] God wants us to share to share even his
[2:01:20] throne on the same basis that he
[2:01:23] overcame and sat down on his father's
[2:01:26] throne
[2:01:27] foreign
[2:01:45] and the little temporary suffering we go
[2:01:49] through now is not worthy to be compared
[2:01:51] to the temp uh the tremendous Glory that
[2:01:54] we will that will be revealed in us when
[2:01:57] it comes is it put it to France
[2:02:08] amen God wants you to reign with them
[2:02:11] and God wants you to sit on this throne
[2:02:15] with him
[2:02:17] that's the reason why he sends us all
[2:02:19] those uh trials
[2:02:22] that's the reason why we have to
[2:02:24] overcome
[2:02:26] because I always say that that there are
[2:02:29] Heaven it's not for cowards
[2:02:46] and when you say that Jesus was saying
[2:02:49] that that John was saying that to them
[2:02:51] that will overcome
[2:02:54] so you have to overcome so what are you
[2:02:58] gonna overcome
[2:02:59] amen well how are you gonna overcome if
[2:03:02] you don't want to go through challenges
[2:03:04] and trials and and difficult times
[2:03:10] that's the reason why we do have those
[2:03:13] times
[2:03:14] amen and when we receive those trials
[2:03:18] God knows every strength God knows our
[2:03:21] strength
[2:03:22] amen God knows how strong we are
[2:03:25] and his word said that he will never
[2:03:27] give us a trial it's about the kingdom
[2:03:30] amen that is beyond
[2:04:29] according to people their battle was not
[2:04:32] fair it's an only jeans
[2:04:36] amen Moses and Pharaoh
[2:04:39] amen according to Bae according to the
[2:04:42] statistic amen that battle was not fair
[2:04:44] it's the only statistics to comment
[2:04:46] about a guy am I Gideon when he had to
[2:04:48] fight with 300 people
[2:04:52] according to the human way of thinking
[2:04:55] that battle was not fair
[2:04:58] even when you had three uh 32 000 people
[2:05:02] that battle was still not fair
[2:05:07] amen but it's not about what people
[2:05:11] think
[2:05:12] it's not about the statistics even it's
[2:05:16] not about you being the first person to
[2:05:18] suffer with this sickness
[2:05:22] amen God knows what you can handle juice
[2:05:26] amen and he gives you exactly what you
[2:05:28] can handle
[2:05:29] amen and he knows that you can
[2:05:54] don't be afraid
[2:05:57] because God is with you it might lift
[2:06:01] him up out of history and I'll speak to
[2:06:03] something to destroy am I lift him up
