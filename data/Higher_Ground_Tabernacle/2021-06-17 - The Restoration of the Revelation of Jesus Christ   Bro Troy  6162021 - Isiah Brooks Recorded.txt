amen you got me believing that you might thinking that you might believe that amen you know you can't believe that without it being revealed to you has to be revealed to you without revelation that

being restored what peace is mine why because that's what's being restored the holy ghost is mine why is that because that's what's being restored and all those things give you the power and the res revelation to say satan get thee behind me a restoration is taking place right now amen there's a perfect song for the message tonight brother it's a perfect song amen let's just uh stand and get right into the word of the lord it's good to see everybody here i i guess telling them i think we missed about five sundays in a row traveling four sundays in a row going here there we were down in arkansas up in michigan out in iowa city in different places preaching the gospel and i had a good several weeks in a row you know i met a lot of people and just just had a lot of good fellowship but it's good to be back here it's good to see every one of you i know i've been here these past several wednesdays but it was good to be here past sunday and see our brother uh preach from arkansas uh i truly enjoyed that brother cliff's messages there both were just landmark messages i enjoyed them both the presence of the lord is here and uh just i don't know what you all got out of it but i know i got something amen i just i appreciate when the lord comes into the place and just begins to show little things and here and there and we need that brother says spiritual revelation is one of the the best things you can get amen you got to have it you can't live without amen you can try to live this christian walk by just reading the word and letting it become a dry letter you can try all you want but until christ comes himself and begins to make this book a new book to you and reveal to open it up to you amen there's nothing like it in the world amen so i wanted to preach a message this evening called the restoration of the revelation of jesus christ amen let's turn our bibles over to luke chapter 19. we'll read the fifth through the tenth verse 19. we'll start with verse 5. very familiar story and it goes like this and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house. well that's a pretty good place to be i think we would all like to hear a word like that i hope we all have heard a word like that amen and he made haste and he came down he received him joyfully when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guests with a man that is a sinner and zacchaeus i love how zacchaeus gets inspired here i can just almost picture him sitting at the table i don't know where he was when he did this but zacchaeus he stands up his heart was overflowing with joy it causes verse eight to happen here and it says and zekia stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor if i have taken anything from any man by false accusation i'll restore it fourfold and jesus said unto him now jesus also was feeling the same feeling you know his joy was welling up in his soul as well amen because this is what jesus was coming back for amen so here verse 9 jesus responds jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of abraham for watch this for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we just thank you lord for this day this evie for what lord where we could the bride of christ could gather together in des moines iowa lord underneath the gospel father lord underneath the everlasting gospel lord lord to hear your words lord to to to to commune to mull over to to watch over the things that you have said in your word father and lord and surely your bride here is standing underneath this voice lord as you gave to me hearing these words lord even my i myself lord and rejoicing in the words that you spoke and saying yes lord amen lord for your bride loves to hear your word father and we pray lord as you are the one lord that has searched the hearts and has made intercession intercession for us according to the will of god lord we pray unto you that tonight your will will be done in our hearts lord and we come out of this place saying surely it was good for us to be in the house of the lord tonight surely the word of god has been revealed to us a little bit more lord i pray father that your bride would rejoice and say amen tonight at the hearing of the gospel lord let it be unto us according to thy word we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated it's definitely good to be like i said be back here in the house of the lord if you could uh aaron if you could put that song victory's mine back up on the screen and go through what we just saw while it's fresh in our minds amen that song victory is mine i appreciate that song amen uh you know like i said you can't say this unless you have a revelation of it you know you cannot you know many people can get those words to utter out of their mouth and say victory is mine well that that word really has a lot of meaning to it you're claiming something you're not just claiming something but you're announcing something to the world victory is now mine now there was a day in the past when victory was not yours but something has caused you to stand up and come into this church tonight to come into this room and to shout out for all the internet and wherever else to hear that the bride of the lord jesus christ right here in des moines iowa is speaking victory is mine and because of that i i have also spoken unto my enemy satan and said get thee behind me because victory is now mine if we could scroll down through the next couple verses here look at there when i woke this morning i didn't have no doubt now remember this has been registered in heaven that you spoke this and let me tell you when i woke this morning there was no doubt victory is mine every morning it has been revealed to me that i know the god who has called me for this hour i know that god has called me for this day go ahead and just leave that up for a while i know the god that has called me to this moment i was born for this moment victory has become mine and it has given me a right to wake up every morning to not have a doubt on my mind amen i knew that the lord would bring me out i didn't have no doubt i got up wake i woke up i didn't have any doubt i knew the lord bring me out so i got down on my knees why because afflictions were coming oh we know afflictions will come even though we say those the victory is mine afflictions are going to come but i get down on my knees i said lord help me please and i rose up singing and shouting the victory now you know st peter did that one day he was he stepped out of the boat in victory i'm gonna walk on this water but the afflictions came and he gave one quick cry to the lord as he was sinking lord help me that's all he recorded that we said and immediately their christ was holding up his hand and we that's why victory was his victory was his one quick cry and then what joy was peter's peace was peter's the husband was peters jesus christ was peter's why one quick cry he called out lord save me and all those things were peter's amen so is that same thing has been given to the bride of christ you can you can shut that off now one quick cry unto the lord and peter said lord save me you know peter for a long time probably thought he was doing pretty good i thought he was doing pretty good when he stepped out of that boat there was that quick revelation he would not have stepped out of that boat if there hadn't been a revelation but when the test came and he began to sink he knew exactly where he had to go lord save me amen one quick cry and he was saved now the son of man we just read there the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost the son of man came to seek out something that was lost and to save something that was lost and you saw it reenacted there in zacchaeus but actually that has reenacted every single time someone catches the revelation of the son of man every time the son of man is revealed to someone that uh that that is being reenacted all over again that someone is being sought out amen and someone is being saved amen because now if you go back to well why are they being saved well because something was lost well for in order to figure out well what is this salvation you have to figure what was lost well in order to figure out what was lost as jesus says from the beginning it wasn't so you have to go right back to what was lost at the beginning well what was lost was just what we saw in the song peace was lost in the beginning peace was theirs they lost it joy was theirs in the beginning but they lost it now if you could just go through and think about how great that fall was i mean you think about walking out in the cool of the morning you know there is never any snowfall there is never any torment in their bodies never any sickness you know walking out into the presence of the lord here comes the presence of the lord god right on time right on schedule right they oh let's go and let's go and have church in the garden again this morning here comes the let's go to have church with god right here in the noon time let's go again in the evening and have church with the lord presence of the lord god again and over and over again the presence of the lord god would meet them day after day after day as they walked through the garden peace was theirs joy was theirs never any sorrows never any death and all when all that was lost every graveyard was created because of that moment every hospital in the land you know they're building more and more hospitals all the time why because someone fell six thousand years ago because of that great fall back there every hospital it was ever created was created every graveyard every little mound of dirt every little tombstone was created right then and there because of the fall the fall was so great and they were designed to walk in the beauty of the presence of the lord into the purity of god's fullness everything that god had in his mind he was pouring out upon adam and eve but yet they lost it they lost it and that fall was so great until they came down to a to the the point of there after uh after they walked through the red sea and they uh were had been brought out by the mighty hand of jehovah and immediately aaron and then they start melting down the silver and gold god gave them and they made that golden calves and they start cutting themselves and worshiping this golden calf and that's how great this fall was so that the men and women they were designed to worship the almighty god even the ones that god had been revealed to could not even keep themselves god would reveal himself to a people and immediately they go on down to idolatry god reveals himself to a people and immediately they go into idolatry they go into sin and god can constantly constantly the son of man was revealed revealed revealed all throughout the bible and immediately the people that god has revealed himself to immediately a few years later a few decades later going right back down into idolatry going right back down into sin and over and over again how great that fall was so far away from what they ought to have been so far away from what the vision of god was but you know as great as that fall was of the fall of this day how powerful the fall has been in our day everyone is blind no one knows where they stand they say it's a gray of date light great light but it's a great day of great darkness and who can see and you walk around this world and no one can see christ they can't see him he's been the whole world has been blinded and no one can see him the fall has been so great so great so great but if the fall has been so great and that means the restoration has to be just as great amen there has to be a restoration to go right back up to where we were fell from there has to be something the restoration has to be so great to bring you right back to what was lost amen jesus said i came to seek and to save everything that was lost if it was lost if something fell if something fell down from what the vision was in the mind of god from the beginning well i've come down in the midst of time and i've come to seek that out and to save it to bring it back to restore in luke 18 there or 19 there right after he says that verse until in verse 10 he says for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost verse 11 and it says and as they heard these things he added and spoke a parable because you can go and put verse 11 on the screen as soon as he said these things he added and he spoke a parable because he was nigh into jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear and he began to give out a parable now he's come to bring a restoration he's come to seek and save that which lost but they thought the key this kingdom would immediately appear and she was like i'm going to give you a parable and then he gives that parable it's a familiar story you remember there was 10 servants i'm not going to read the whole thing i was paraphrasing here the man went to a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return he called his ten servants together to him as his ten servants gathered together he said i want you to occupy until i come and he gave them ten talents one talent per servant they told them occupy until i come but the citizens they hated him and they sent a message after him saying will not that this these men this man reign over us is not what the people today say they don't want christ to reign over him they are looking for every single thing that that the christian church has done throughout the ages and they says we don't want to be ruled by this christian church and they want to shake off all the shackles of morality all the shackles of of everything right but there's still 10 servants and it came to pass so when he returned to having received the kingdom they commanded his servants to be called to him unto him he had given the money he might know how much every man had gained by trading and you know the story came to one the one says well i thy pound now that he gave me is gained ten pounds he says uh a good and faithful servant because you've been faithful with very little have thou authority over ten cities the second one said the power that you gave me has gained five pounds he says likewise to him be thou also over five cities but then another king says lord here is the pound that you gave me here is the money that you gave me and i i kept it i laid it up in a safe place in this napkin here because i was afraid of you i knew that that were you're a strict man and that you take us up what you don't lay down and you reap what you did not sow and immediately that servant is judged by the words that came out of his mouth and he said i shouldn't because god expects a return from his investments god always expects a return in his investments if god has ever like as hebrews 6 says they that have tasted of the heavenly gift those that have been given a portion of the holy ghost those who have experienced the holy ghost god has an expectation to reap more than what he gave you if he has given you a token of the holy ghost giving you an expression of the holy ghost if he's ever once tugged at your heart's door come knocking by your heart's door if he's ever wants to fill you with the holy ghost everyone's giving you joy in your heart unspeakable amen or love divine any of those things if he ever once has given you those things he has an expectation that that thing will be multiplied in your life that'll be nurtured and they'll grow up and bear fruit and when hero comes back that he'll receive 10 times more than what he gave you amen now they thought the kingdom of god should immediately appear but there had to come a time of bearing a fruit there had to come a planting and there had become a growing and there had to come a harvest amen that had to repeat itself over and over again every age had to repeat itself seven ages amen constantly there was a a word would go out amen there was a sowing of the word a messenger would go out a word would be sowed into the earth a portion of the holy spirit would be given to an age and those would everybody had was responsible to do with the holy spirit whatever they would like to do amen just like esther in the bible that she was given everything that she wanted to have from the king's chambers however she wanted to present herself to the king in that age she had the right to present herself to the king that way and she was given everything she wanted and so she sought out the the the chamberlain and she said well what does the king like amen what does the king want to see hey i want to wear whatever it is that the king wants amen and every age has had that responsibility and this age is no different we have a responsibility not just to play with the gifts not just to uh as many churches have done not just to uh brag about having the gifts not just to break our church can speak with tongues or or our church can do this or and we've had those ages of that in time past but those ages are gone by amen amen now is not the age to be just bragging about having the gifts or to be bragging about this or or or to show off oh i got more than this no no no there is a time where there comes a time of restoration amen even as brother brahm in the tent mission he said it won't that third poll it will not be an open show he says i saw them go into that little structure and they had come out completely restored completely delivered completely made whole remember around the time of the seals he said i believe the day is coming the even missing limbs will be restored he had this vision in his mind that there's a day where restoration has to happen amen now that restoration that that that message of restoration has now come to a last day peoples amen now it came to every age right the messenger to every age had their portion of their age they had the message to their age and when those they received the message that was a golden age to them now if you they did not receive the the the message they went off into judgment but for those that did receive the message they would go on to another age amen and so has it been in the laodicean age there has become to be a bride of christ who has stood up she's heard the message come out of her my people that you be not partaker of her sins amen and then as she looks within herself and she sees the sins the sins of the church world are revealed to her the two s the two the the two spirits that are in the church all throughout all ages uh have been revealed to her she listened to the message that was given to her and when she missed listens to that message all sudden a light bulb goes off and she begins to identify those two spirits in the church and there's always been those two spirits one of them is wicked and one of them is the holy ghost the seal the the trail of the serpent and the trail of the holy ghost those two trails that have gone down through the church history have now ended up at this last day but this last day the bride stands up she hears that that message come out of her my people that you beat up partakers of her sins and when she hears that message instantly those two spirits are revealed to her her eyes are opened she can see why that's why she can say get thee behind me satan why because it's been revealed to her who the son of man is who the revelation of the holy ghost is who the true holy spirit is and who that imposter is it's been revealed to her now we are not the first people throughout the ages they've been given a promise of restoration amen but you know in every age where there was given a promise of restoration the the message of restoration was to bring back to what was lost you know when abraham was getting old the the angel the lord spoke to him he says your seed will go into a foreign land they'll go into the land of the street and there'll be a stranger in a foreign land for 400 years but after those 400 years are over amen that i will bring them out with great substance with great riches and i will bring them right back here and restore them to the land that i have promised you and god did it amen god brought them out of egypt with all the wealth and gold of egypt they left egypt poor when they left amen and what they do they marched right to that promised land amen and they took it over it took them a while but they got there but there was a promise there regardless of how how they inherited the promise everyone in that age there was a joshua and caleb that marched out and says this is possible i can do this and there is always going to be someone that's going to stand up like joshua and caleb and say victory is mine i told satan get thee behind victory is now mine and they start naming it out peace is mine joy is mine the holy ghost is mine the land of israel the land of milk and honey joshua and caleb that land is mine and because it's mine every enemy that is in front of me i can say get thee behind me get thee behind me why because this is mine this is a day of restoration and because joshua and caleb realized that they were on a day of restoration they were the ones that were restored amen but to those that did not believe in the day of restoration they were the ones that didn't get to be restored now in the book of jeremiah another day of restoration was prophesied jeremiah 29 you remember you know isaiah and jeremiah both those prophets were were hammering on israel hammering on his on israel that you're you're getting ready to fall your your sins are heaping up you know the the prophecy of isaiah isaiah got greater and greater and greater and greater as he got older and older and older and all of a sudden time was too late another prophet came on the scene by the name of jeremiah and god says i'm sending you jeremiah but they're not going to listen to you time was running out instead of having a messenger of grace and mercy of a chance of an opportunity to repent they received a prophet that just preached judgment judgment judgment judgment amen but as soon as they went off into captivity as they were put into chains and led to babylon there in jeremiah's day that jeremiah stayed behind in jerusalem and as they went there to babylon that jeremiah was one day he was standing there in the courts or wherever he was and all of a sudden the voice of the lord came to him and it's jeremiah 29 and 30 and the lord said to him write a letter to those in captive down there in jerusalem or in babylon write them a letter and he's te and this is what he told him he says 70 years he said i want you to go down there in peace i want you to go down there and in 29 5 he says build you houses dwelt and plant gardens eat fruit of them take wives big ass sons and daughters and all these things he's telling them be comfortable in babylon just wait there seek the peace of the city where i've caused you to be carried captives pray unto the lord for that city of babylon or wherever you are for in the peace thereof ye shall have peace and and god told him just sit here be comfortable be comfortable amen but then in verse 10 he says for thus saith lord after 70 years i will come and i will visit you i have perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place verse 11 he tells them for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and ought of evil to give you an unexpected and think about the condition these people were in they lost their temple they lost their homeland they lost everything that jehovah had given them all the gold that solomon had created all the all the the temple that solomon had created all the the ark of the covenant and everything the the ten commandments that moses had in the ark of the covenant they lost it all they lost every little bit of it and now they're in chains in babylon and and they're wondering where did we go wrong what happened to us here and god sends a message there will be a restoration there will be a day of restoration and you wait here and and he told them the time the restoration happened 70 years the restoration came place and i'll bring you back out of this place i will restore you back amen i will visit you i will perform my word towards you i will have thoughts of peace towards you i with at that time you'll call upon me you'll go and you'll pray to me and i will hearken unto you you shall seek me and you will find me when you seek with me me with all your heart you will find me and oh and just constantly messages of mercy messages of grace and then he says i will be found of you i will turn away your captivity i will gather you together amen i'll bring you back here right again what i will restore saith the lord i'll restore saith the lord god constantly gave them a message of restoration same thing happened in the day in the days of joel chapter two he says when they're living there and they hadn't fully received the promises yet amen they were trying to bring back to to jerusalem they hadn't received the promises yet and god says i will come i will send you the former and the latter reign i will restore all the years that the enemy is eaten amen i will do this i will do that i will do this and there's came a day of revealing god always throughout all these messages of restoration he first prophesies of the falling away amen and then as the falling away is taking place he says but you're going to come back but you're going to come back and however great that fall was that's how great the restoration was whatever it was that you lost that's what you're going to receive back amen but you know all those all those natural restorations have taken place and all those natural restorations have taken place but we've come here in the last days and there is a a day of restoration not just to inherit a natural land but no but the meek shall inherit the whole earth amen not just the restoration of uh gold and silver on this earth but of gold and silver in the heavens amen not just uh you know gold and silver you you pay someone go do this for me and it'll be done but no but no but speak the word believe on me ask whatever you will it should be done to you oh that's more than gold or silver for the gold and silver the future kingdom is the word of god and the faith in that word and that's what's being restored faith in the word of god amen everything that was lost has to be restored amen and we're living in that day of the final restoration for the bride of christ let's turn over to luke 17 30. remember they said this is where the pharisees had demanded when is the kingdom of god going to come that you keep preaching about verse 21 he says don't don't look say over here over there he says the kingdom of heaven kingdom of god is within you but then he began to talk to his disciples and tell them about the second coming and he says the days will come we shall desire to see one of these days of the son of man verse 22 you won't see it and he says you'll say see here see there but don't go after them don't follow them for as the lightning lighteneth out one part of the heaven unto the other part so shall the son of man be in his day but first must he be rejected of many things to be rejected of this generation and he has been rejected and as it was in the days of noah so shall be in the days of the son of man there will come again the days of the son of man right verse 27 they did they eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and then the flood came and destroyed them all you know it's going to be the same way in this day it is already verse 28 likewise also in the days of lot they were eating they were drinking they sold they planted they built it but this that same day that lot went out of sodom and rained down fire and brimstone from heaven and it destroyed them all even thus shall be in the day that the son of man is being revealed amen even thus shall be in the day that the son of man has been revealed the son of man has been and is being revealed amen the son of man has been and is being revealed that is the day that we are living in now i don't know about you but i know i've preached this over and over again now brother farmer here i i i love that testimony he gave it was death i hadn't heard that testimony before and it was just to have a witness stand right here and we are without excuse and he told the testimony about how his his dad was a little boy and was crippled in 1961 and his and his grandfather brought his son brought the son to one of brother bram's meetings and wasn't sure and he wasn't sure about he had heard that brother branham was a mind reader and he so he went back and he was researching what mind reading was and i'm just telling his testimony again i hope that's all right but he's telling why his test that the the testimony of it or that that his his grandfather and brother cliff's grandfather had said that he didn't know what a mind reader was so he went back and researched it and found out that if you sit far enough away they can't read your mind so he went to brother branham's meeting and he went and he set way way way in the back and he put the brother forest you know all know brother forrest i just met him there again about a month ago put his young son forrest down on the floor laid him down there crippled son and i don't remember the whole testimony but but uh as as uh brother branham was there preaching that message in 1961 that all of a sudden i believe it was the first the first the first uh the sign that was given that night was that brother branham called out the brother all the way in the back and said you there you pray you're praying for your son he's crippled thus saith the lord he'll be healed your name is mr farmer take him back go back to where you came from you're healed called his name now i don't know about you but if that had been me in that meeting wild horses couldn't drag me away from this message couldn't do it why because god gave that to that brother now i may not have been there in that meeting i wasn't there but i have heard it on the tapes and when i hear those things i realize that a man cannot do that when brother branham would turn his back to the audience he was doing that for a very specific reason he wasn't showing off there's you know there's some people who think that he was just trying to show off trying to be a show-off no he was mimicking a sign he was revealing a sign amen to this gender i won't say the word mimicking but he was revealing a sign to this generation that just like the angel that visited abraham that same angel is visiting us again amen just like lot was down there in sodom and gomorrah abraham the chosen one was up on the hill receiving a visitation and even so as the whole world is blinded they're off in sodom and gomorrah we in these last days have received a visitation and as the angel stood with us back to the tent and said why why did sarah laugh even brother brandon was staying with us back to the audience you there in the yellow dress you were just praying you were just praying and about your father who's in louisville go back and find him and as your faith as you believed you'll find him healed that was a sign to this age what was that sign for this is a day of the revealing of the son of man a day when all things shall be restored a day when we're not just receiving a restoration back to the israel to a natural or have a restored temple but to have the temple restored to have the earth restored and all those things have come to you and to me i don't want to you know people they think well it's been so many decades now and people are beginning to drift away we're going to cool off the the revealing of the son of man it doesn't excite them anymore but i want to tell you that the passage of time has not diluted this revelation what it has done is brought us more and more closer to what brother brown called the next thing now if you google or if you uh search in the message the next thing you'll come up especially as you get closer to the end with a lot of things what brother bam said about what the next thing is now and he said the next thing was what the rapture the next thing is the renewing of your body the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping version of the sleeping bride all these things are the next thing we are coming up to the time of the next thing the bride of christ right now the son of man has been revealed to us and we're waiting for the next thing and the next thing is our bodies are going to begin to change amen say oh brother when's it going to happen right before israel receives their two witnesses right before israel begins to get a wake-up call right before all the world begins to hate israel i i well i don't know about you saints but when i look at the the promise of that what this word says i think we're living in the last days we're living in the last minutes the last hours the last seconds the last days upon this earth the son of man has been revealed and is being revealed to you amen the son of man has been revealed and is being revealed to you if you can receive it if you can receive it now many will not receive it the son of the revelation of the son of man came two thousand years ago many didn't see it many they thought oh you restore the kingdom right now and and that was the right thought the right thought but no now is not the time wait there's gotta be a falling away there's gotta be a planting uh and then there's gotta be a watering and there's gotta be a reaping well we're here at the reaping time saints we've arrived we're here we're here the the the the the tares had the had to grow up together the wheat and the tears had to grow up together until the end but at the end time blurband said a messenger would come out and a messenger would bind up the tares the messenger has bound up the terrorists and a voice went out to the wheat come out of her my people that she not be partaker of the terror of sins so the tares are being bound the wheat stands alone the wheat is man that's what we're that's happening right now is the wheat is standing alone all of us are standing alone by the power of the holy ghost and it's only in him that we can stand it's in him we live in him we move in him we have our being amen everything everything we have is because of him all of our power all of our standing everything we have is because of him we can't even walk without him holding our hands amen we can't even survive one moment of this laodicean age we can't we can't fight the enemy by ourselves we wouldn't last a moment without it we got to have the holy ghost in our lives we got to have the freshness of the power of the holy ghost oh that foolish virgin she wakes up and she realizes i don't have the holy ghost like i thought i did i like i used to have but not so with the bride of christ she's got that extra vessel right there by her side amen right there by her side and when she begins to run a little dry oh just give me a couple of seconds in the presence of the lord just get let me close my eyes for two seconds i'll be right there in the presence of the lord amen i receive a refilling of the holy ghost why because it's promised to me it's a promise that the wise virgins would have a refilling available at all times a refilling available at all times was promised give me my mountain amen it's my inheritance he paid for it this is the day of restoration he came to seek and to save that which was lost and to restore them back to the position they lost amen before the foundation or before the however great that fall was that's how great the restoration has to be amen amen he came to make a restoration amen yoda and you look at the pattern of the book of revelations you look at the it's beautiful if you actually kind of just take a high-level view of the book of revelations it's really beautiful how everything is laid out because in the beginning of the book in revelations chapter 1 brother brandon called the patmos vision amen and he he talked about the deity of jesus christ that jesus christ is being revealed and in the beginning there you hear one voice that's the voice of the lord jesus christ christ is being revealed and as christ is being revealed all of a sudden all of a sudden you all suddenly looks down at his hand he realizes that there christ has seven stars in his hand amen and he's walking in the midst of these seven golden candle sticks amen all sudden and then and then saint john begins to catch the revelation of all the church ages and he's catching the revelation jesus christ will be in the midst of every age every age you'll have the revelation of jesus christ i've gotten seven stars holding right in the hand of christ and i'll send them to every age to this age to this age to this age and to the laodicean age they will receive a message and it will be right back to like the message of the first age amen amen and then and every single message every single age received their message and those messengers were in the hand of the re of revealed the lord jesus christ and the and the lord revealed lord jesus christ was walking in the midst of those seven golden churches so those seven golden candle sticks was walking right in the midst of him amen even so right now in the midst of the laodicean age christ has been circling the candlestick walking in the midst of it holding the messenger in your hands amen so when you look at the life of brother bam realizing that he was in the hand of the lord jesus christ he was that star amen he was gifted that that that anointing amen that angel to be that was that star in the hand and that's the message we have received amen and after john caution caught the revelation of those seven ages all of a sudden a door was opened into heaven and the voice say come up here there john i want to show you things to come i want to lift you up off these natural things and come up into the heavens i want to show you the heavenly things and then brother ram starts saying you know john was a type of the bride of christ amen and so the bride of christ also has to be resurrected not just in a rapture but before the rapture she has to be revealed that son of man has to be revealed to her amen and as the son of man is revealed to her she sits with him in his throne she sits with him in heavenly places and she begins to blend more from the negative to the positive amen is what brother branson and she leaves the leo laodicean age behind and enters into a bride age to be prepared for a rapture right now is the revealing of the son of man and the son of man must be revealed to you after the seven ages were revealed in a mystery then john went up into the heavens and the book of redemption was revealed that the the book of the redemption had the entire plan of god all the way back to the beginning and it was revealed to the bride after she goes up into heavenly places is revealed to the bride what the mystery of that book was and to what the mystery of what was lost amen so to be in order to be restored back you have to know what you lost and so the seals were ripped off the book and we begin to reveal this is what was lost and all those mysteries of marriage and divorce and melchizedek all these things that and brother branham just starts going through and preaching the message preaching the messages preaching the messages if you don't know what all those are you got to listen to them the son of man ought to be revealed to you let the seals be unveiled to you amen why because that's the pattern of the bride of christ where like when john went up hither so the bride has to go up hither and experience the opening of the book to her the opening of the mysteries and as the mysteries are beginning to be revealed to you and then you see a slain lamb standing in the midst of those victories because let me tell you some of those mysteries are revealed you realize i'm on the wrong side of them i mean there's some that are divorced there's some that are this there's some that are that there's some that are this amen by then there stands that slain lamb right in the midst of the revealed mysteries and brother bannon says i tell my people don't you do that again amen what the slain lamb was standing right in the middle the revealed mysteries giving the look this is the way it's supposed to be i am restoring you back to this amen and the mysteries are being revealed what what's happening our old sins all the things that we've done all in all of our foolishness all the things we're done are being stripped away from us amen put in the sea of forgetfulness as we watch that slain land we've gone into heavenly places and we see the sacrifice upon the throne once it's been revealed to you that you're standing righteous purified redeemed by the blood of the lamb he's come to seek and save that which was lost and that was me but now he's placed us back as sons and daughters of god and restored us back he's put us in position like the fall never took place brother graham said hallelujah and once you get into that condition then you march forward in the re in the book of revelation then it begins to reveal what's going to happen to the jews and then begins to reveal the enemy the enemy the enemy is beginning to be revealed all he's done throughout all the ages all that he's doing in this present age and how that trail of the serpent has weaved its way throughout history and all that is revealed to the bride of christ and brother bran said that the true church will catch the revelation of who the true church is and of the two spirits amen shall realize who she is she realized who the two spirits are in the church and she can identify that that trail of the serpent as it moves on down throughout the church throughout the ages and right up to this day right now that was a great falling away the serpent is still moving through the church well it's revealed to the bride of christ amen we have followed the pattern of the book of revelations perfectly israel at this time is being revealed to us right because things are happening in israel in the natural to get them ready it has been happening since the 40s israel is being prepared in the natural and as soon as the bride goes up she'll begin to be prepared in the supernatural by the holy ghost by the two witnesses amen but right now we right now israel is being prepared in the natural while we are being prepared in the supernatural amen remember the old testament there was the two brides that were prepared there was a there was an esther and a ruth one was a jew one was a gentile same thing in this day there's two brides the gentile bride and the jewish bride 144 000. but after the enemy is revealed as soon as that enemy is revealed a voice goes out and says come out of her my people that you've been our partakers over since and there's got to come in the last days where where the they will they they must leave there was a time where yeah you can stay yes you can stay but there comes a time where you must leave there was a time when denominations were okay anyway but now there is a time now where you must leave you must come out of her my people you must come not just not denominations about denominational thinking amen all the systems of man even right here in this message every system of man must fall and the bride has to stand alone by the power of none but the holy ghost come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and then right after that and also the voice says john i want to show you something i want to show you the last revelation the last of this revelation and he says i want to show you the bride the lamb's wife she's been restored he looks at her and when he sees that bride she's without spot yes sir she's with that wrinkle she's been washed by the blood of the lamb all the wrinkles have been ironed out by the flame and the heat of the holy spirit she's been restored brother and john says i saw the bride coming down from god out of heaven having the glory of god upon her having the glory of god upon her isn't that what happened in the upper room they had the glory of god upon them we're being restored back to what was lost to have the glory of god right upon us right there the first fruits was shown right there now the last roots must be shown amen the next thing brother bam said is the resurrection the next thing is the resurrection of the bride returning young again like sarah and abraham the next thing now the beginning of the book in revelation twice jesus christ whose mitch says i am the alpha and the omega i'm the beginning of the end he spoke by himself and it's mentioned twice again in the end but this time when it's mentioned twice he says that the in the the beginning of revelation says i am the alpha omega twice the end of the book of revelation he says i am the alpha and omega twice but this time instead of christ being revealed alone now christ and the the spirit and the bride are together and when they speak they're saying the same thing the beginning there was one voice at the end there's two voices the spirit and the bride are speaking they're speaking in unison and they're saying the same thing the spirit and the bride are saying come come on come on well when does that happen that happens right at the very end right before the rapture the spirit and the bride must say come let all who is thirsty come come to the last time the last moments the last seconds that those let them come drink of the water of life freely let them come and drink of this well of the holy ghost come there's there's still a few seconds left there's still a few minutes left before the rapture of the bride of christ come the spirit and the bride have to speak in unison everything that the bride the spirit says the bride says yes and amen to it they are in unison and she has a revelation of alpha and omega the beginning has now become the end amen we are being restored back to whatever was lost at the beginning amen amen alpha has become omega jehovah jireh has become jehovah's shaman amen our provider has become the presence amen of the lord jesus christ as the son of man has revealed to you it brings his presence amen amen there must be a promise of restoration amen all the effects of the fall are to be reversed in this hour amen and just like joshua and caleb before they crossed that river jordan they got to go across the river jordan a little bit early eat the fruits of the land bring back the evidence of the land before everybody else went over and tell me what do you you know i believe that that that as brother brown says i believe the time will come when missing limbs will be restored he says i saw them going to that booth and they came out what happened what happened she said i don't know what happened i bet i've been completely restored there's got to be a time come when rapturing faith begins to to to rise up within the bride of christ why is that say because she says victory is mine peace is mine joy is mine the holy ghost is mine all these things are mine and i spoke said to satan get thee behind me i've been resurrected i've i've been i've been the son of man has been revealed to me i know who he is i know who i am and we're beginning to speak in in unison the alpha has become the omega the son of man that was revealed 2000 years ago has now been revealed to me i know who he is and not only do i know who he is i know who i am amen when she knows who she is and she can do the greater works then a rapture takes place amen that's the moment in time that we are living in amen jesus christ came to seek and to save that which was lost amen there were two rich men at that time that jesus was ministering to there was the rich young ruler and god spoke to him and the rich young ruler came up to him and says a good master you know what what what must i do to be saved you know he says well what does the scripture say how do you read it and he says well you know i do that i'll be good be a good person and do this over here and i had all those things and and jesus says well you know the young ruler says i've done all that since i was young and jesus says well one thing you still lack he says i want you to sell all that you have and then you'll have treasure in heaven and then come and follow me if you want to be perfect perfection was laid before him like an open door but you know that zacchaeus got a little bit different message because when jesus came to zacchaeus at his house zacchaeus was up in a tree and jesus looked at him and said come down zacchaeus i have to come and eat with you i must come and eat with you and as they were sitting there at the table all of a sudden zacchaeus got inspired he stood up he says lord the half that i have i give to you to the poor now the rich young ruler had to give everything but here zacchaeus just sit up and voluntarily gave half what why the difference now to the one the one lost salvation but when zacchaeus did it jesus stood up and says this day salvation has come to this house for christ has come to seek and save that which was lost what was the difference well zacchaeus was one that was lost the rich young ruler hadn't been lost he didn't have that representation amen he could follow in the natural but he couldn't the son of man could not be revealed to him all it was just a dead letter to him but to him who the son of man is revealed to them it's not all you have to give all this up and do all this the do's and don'ts no it's jesus said when he sat down at the last supper he's he breathed in deeply he had the cup of wine there he breathes in the aroma of the wine he says with desire i have desire to eat the supper with you before i suffer and i tell you the truth i will not eat of this again until i eat it with you in glory because he had in mind you and me that he was not going to eat or the fruit of the vine again until you and me could join him at the last supper he said with desire i have desired to eat this supper with you and even so there at the supper tale of zacchaeus you know we're at the tree there he says zacchaeus come down i must eat with you today god has a desire for fellowship amen every single one of us has been laid an open door before us you can either be the rich young ruler or you could be zacchaeus you can either uh be worrying about all the do's and don'ts and try to live a natural christian life or or you could have the son of man be revealed to you but if the son of man be revealed to you then come up hither and see where you're standing amen brother branson says break into we all break into the heavenlies and see where we're at amen but until you break into those heavenlies until you get into that spirit you can't see how can the son of man be revealed to you how can you know where you're standing we are we're standing here in this dull dreary age with everything is gray and black and and it's a it's a it's not a dark day it's not a light day everything's gray and misty amen it's a pale horse age but to those that saw a great light the clouds began to part they began to soar up above the clouds and they get a glimpse of the sun amen i like i you get on those dry dreary days and you get on an airplane and you park through those clouds and you know you're one of the only people in the city that gets to see the sun that day you're a special man you're a special woman amen so is it so with the bride of christ if you take advantage of it and a door has been opened to heaven to every single one of us amen we have a duty to say what the bride says to say what the spirit says amen to speak in unison amen and to be restored back to everything that was lost and when caleb got to that river and he began to realize that there was an opportunity 400 years 440 years has been since we since we crossed this river since we went the wrong direction since we lost our inheritance all those years since since joseph was sold into slavery i haven't had a chance to go back but now is the time to be restored and when joshua and caleb caught that revelation they got inspired and they said this is mine this fruit is mine give me my mountain i get thee behind me satan all this is mine and so the bride of christ she looks at these things and she knows that tent vision is hers everything has been restored to her and will be if you can believe it amen if you can receive it if the son of man can be revealed to you amen as brother brown says you have to break into the heavenlies and see where you're standing amen so is it so with the bride of christ you got to break into the spirit because you can't say what the spirit says unless you're in the spirit and we ought to be in the spirit on the lord's day amen let's just stand amen those great doctrinal questions that are brought to the lord jesus christ he'd say but from the beginning it wasn't so well what was it like at the beginning i've come to seek and save those things that were lost to bring restoration how was it so at the beginning i've come to restore and now all that restoration that he talked about has been revealed again to a last day bryant who have received a message the supernatural message that that came with supernatural that was announced to the world through a prophet named william branham who had a humble ministry of doing something that no other man was doing [Music] oh there might be impersonators like that something about that that the bride recognizes [Music] i've seen that i've heard of that before that's just like my lord and savior jesus christ i've seen something that the son of man is being revealed and that's still happening the son of man is still being revealed that revelation is still there and we need it we need a day in day out every hour why because the more you stare into his face the more you are changed from glory to glory the more you look at his face the more you are changed the more you are perfected amen and we we look into his face as we get into our prayer closets as we list coming to church and listen to the messages as we worship him as we adore him as we bear witness to him we see his face continually amen as we see his face more and more we are constantly being perfected by the ministry of lord savior jesus christ amen going from glory to glory right now we are eating more and more grapes more and more grapes more grapes entering crossing over into that promised land saying get thee behind the scene this land is my land it belongs to me sitting with christ in heavenly places amen we might not be able to see it with these natural eyes all the time but oh my break into the spirit break into the heavenlies see where you're standing let these walls dissolve around you once more like they happened to gaheza oh lord elisha said open this young man's eyes and i pray that the same thing brother branham says open this bride's eyes so she can see where she's standing and all of a sudden her eye the bride's eyes were open said she surrounded amen a wall of fires round about jerusalem like zechariah saw amen zachariah you're the angel so they told the angel was given the commandment go measure jerusalem exactly just watch angel comes back i have done what you said to do jerusalem has been measured we know how wide it is we know how tall it is and here are the measurements and then the one that was speaking the righteous one said i know exactly how big it is i know how big the border is i know how big the walls are and let me tell you i will be a wall of fire around about it amen i'll be the anointing in the midst i'll be the olive trees i'll be it all i'll be everything amen the soul will be so for the bride of christ he knows how he knows every member of the bride of christ he knows the the the walls of the new jerusalem have been measured names on the book of life have been measured go measure them where are they at go find them where are they at and the message went out to every single one of them and a wall of fire has been round about him why by the receiving of a message by the revelation that's how the wall of fire comes about amen [Music] heavenly father i know maybe a mysterious message but lord all these scriptures all these prophecies come together and speak of one thing lord [Music] that we're living in the last days and here in the last days that the bride of christ still has something to look forward to to a body change to a quickening spirit to a restoration to having the son of man being revealed to her to have her eyes wide open as that veil is ripped off and she sees her lord and savior who was crucified for the bloody lamb being revealed the mysteries revealed to her as she stands there she stands the holy spirit has been revealed to her and they stand in unison and say come let those who are thirsty come come to the water of life freely be restored back and give out that message in the last minutes of time of restoration is coming the last minutes of the hours of the gentiles is to be finished as god switches over to the jews lord let it be unto us in his last days thy word lord let our eyes be opened lord to the revelation lord of exactly what you've called us to be in this last days because we don't want to miss one thing lord i pray let the we go more from the negative to the positive to look more into the supernatural than we do with the things that are natural to break into the heavens to see where we're at let it be unto us according to the word that was spoken to us in these last days in the name of jesus [Music] christ it was a beautiful ceremony man [Music] just like your heart and be zacchaeus to have fellowship with him amen to commune with him so you can bring restoration into your house bring salvation into your house communion sweet [Music] to communion with you is what we long to do communion holy communion [Music] lord we lost [Music] community [Music] is lord we love to come in with you lord we long to come [Music] sweet [Music] is [Music] [Music] sweet communion [Music] is [Music] wave our hands [Music] father that's our prayer [Applause] [Music] communion [Music] is [Music] lord we long to come here for the last oh sweet communion [Music] lord we lost oh lord [Music] with you amen [Music] you
