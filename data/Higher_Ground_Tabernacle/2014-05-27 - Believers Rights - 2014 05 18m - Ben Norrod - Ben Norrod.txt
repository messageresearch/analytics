of y'all need to send a memo to your face because your body don't have the Revelation just yet well I'm happy brother Ben can't you tell no sir no ma'am I sure can every Christian that's really got full of the Holy Ghost they want want to show it amen he said but my show is a little slow well that's all right just speed it up a little bit at a time a little bit more a little bit more because God inhabits the praise of his people don't you think so amen well let's come to church and get drunk this morning what do you say Amen let's turn to the Book of Exodus the book of Exodus I want to preach to you this morning on the believer's rights believer's rights and how many knows what one of your rights is get drunk on the Holy Ghost drunk folk don't worry about bills drunk folk don't worry about problems drunk folk don't worry about nothing except for where they're going to get their next drink praise the Lord some of y'all look scared to death already Lord have mercy where is he taken us Exodus chapter 16 verse 31 let's look now at the book that Moses wrote of the Journey of the children of Israel Exodus 16:31 and the house of Israel called the name thereof mana and it was like corander seed white the taste of it was like Wafers made with honey Moses said this is the thing which the Lord commandeth fill an Omar of it to be kept for your Generations that they may see I'm happy can't you tell see why that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt Moses said unto Aaron take a pot put an R full of Mana therein and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generations and a message called believest thou this brother Bram said every believer that'll break behind the curtain Yonder and enter into this priesthood has a right to eat of the original Mana that fell on the day of Pentecost a real oldfashioned Holy Ghost blessing and brother Bram says hallelujah let's pray together Heavenly Father how we thank you this morning Lord thy great Mercy Lord where will we be without you today as I just reflected this morning in my fellowship with brother Brooks God how far you've brought us from things Lord that we wouldn't have even realize would have been issues problems difficulties in our life but somehow your precious hand always illuminates that which we need the most and I realize Lord after these years of serving you there'll be many more years Lord that I'll need illumination I'll need your hand to reveal to me things in my life areas of my life that I need to make right but I need to be better be closer Lord as we were talking last night somehow we just feel so disappointed not because of our Revelation or what we believe but because of how we serve you sometimes we want to do our very best for your kingdom I pray today that as you take your word that you will illuminate those areas of our life where why we can serve you in a much greater compacity I pray the Holy Spirit will take his word this morning use your servant today Lord you see my body my mind my thoughts I pray that you would take it under your perfect Supremacy and control that you would use me by your divine grace to be a conduit to channel Your Divine energy to the hearts of your people may the Holy Spirit I pray take them and as they receive may they just connect to that conduit of life may they just engage Lord into the word and may they just Connect into that surge of energy that they might receive eternal life in a greater abundance than they've ever had today encourage the discouraged strengthen the weak May the Holy Spirit heal the sick Save The Lost do all that thy would be pleased to do this morning as we commit the word both speaker and hearer to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and the church said amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you real real good well' you come to get drunk well that's good because I'm going to tell you friends I believe with all my heart this message what we have failed to get the people into has not been deeper Revelation not more books not more tapes not more MP3s not more this that or the other but we've just simply gotten too sober around this message now that's one reason why the devil has so much to say in our minds and our ears and around us every way is because let's face facts we've just sobered up way too much now the truth of it is when we first came into this great truth we was so drunk on the spirit of God that we didn't worry about what the devil said we didn't worry about what preachers said or what deacons said or anybody else said for that matter all we cared about is what Jesus thought and where we going to get our next drink from now one thing we realize is that natural intoxication now I'm not preaching you to go out and go to the bar and get drunk this morning but natural intoxication is a perfect parallel of spiritual intoxication now we realize that the Virgin Mary herself when she came out of the upper room you realize that the the imagery the statue and so forth that we see in many Catholic churches is not the way Mary looked when she came out of the upper room amen we see her standing there with her hands in what they call the power position and a halo over her head and kind of a pious look on her face and she's not really smiling all that smile that goes up to her eyes she just kind of got that half smile you know what I'm talking about and and she just very Reverend very Pious very holy but you realize that's not the original snapshot the original photograph she looked like a staggering drunk praise the Lord now you say brother Ben that scares me to death well then you're on the wrong church this morning amen you're in the wrong church because only the elect of God are going by the Rapture by Holy Fire and it will be holy fire that will cleanse every disease germ it will clear the Earth off and renovate it give it its new birth and it will be the Holy Fire that will bring us back to the original that was given on the day of Pentecost now when we look at this in the book of Exodus we realize then that brother Bram is giving us a parallel as he says that the believer has a right to go get this Mana now of course we don't mean go behind the veil and pull back the curtain and go and find a piece of that original Mana but it's a type it's a parallel and what he's trying to show us is that as Believers that original bread that fell on the day of Pentecost you and I have a right to partake of that bread now we know what Jesus said St John 6 that I am the bread of life and you can eat of me and so forth and we realize that Jesus himself being the bread of life that it was more than just eating the natural flesh of the son of man or drinking his natural blood we realize it's not cannibalism or not that sort of thing but it was partaking of the mystery behind the word now the word of God is wonderful we know that the gospel is part word but remember the gospel itself or the word itself contains a mystery and the Mystery behind that word is the Holy Ghost praise the Lord Paul himself tells us Colossians chapter 1 1267 he said even the mystery the mystery which hath been hid where was it hid at behind the word and the word hid the mystery of what Christ the Holy Ghost in you which is the hope of glory now we realize when Moses when this bread first Falls and it falls on the day on on on the day when these children of Israel are out there in the wilderness looking for bread looking for substance and God reins it down on them that this bread as long as it was out of the presence of the Lord it would breed worms and it would stink but take that very same bread and put it in the spirit and then that bread then would stay fresh it would never get old it would never get stale now take it out of the out of the presence of God and then it sits on the back row and it doesn't clap its hands doesn't raise its hands it's comes in about half backslid you excuse me back here I'm going to pick on you a little bit this morning but it doesn't have any Joy doesn't have any enthusiasm hasn't read its Bible and ain't no telling how long it comes to church when it feels like coming to church it kind of prays when it feels like coming to pray but the bread in the presence of the Lord ain't like that it can't wait for them doors to open to get back into the house of God well praise the Lord not sure what kind of bread I'm preaching to this morning looks like some Ines and some oues now you notice this when you look in Deuteronomy chapter 8:7 now just turn that with me if you will just look at this just a moment now you notice that this bread was only a precursor to all that God had laid in the land for them there was many more blessings many more promises that God had in store for them that he wanted them to partake of but yet you realize that that they was only tasting of uh as it was an initial blessing from God now we have all those experiences in our life there'll be certain people when they start coming to the Lord they'll have an initial blessing a little something God will do this way or that way that will lead them up into the presence of God but once a man or woman goes back in behind that Veil then and steps into the presence of God then that that initial blessing begins to multiply you understand now notice the Deuteronomy 8:7 for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land it is a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and Hills notice a land of wheat barley Vines fig trees pomegranates a land of olive oil and of honey and notice a lamb with shall eat bread bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it at all amen and it says a land whose stones are iron and out of whose Hills thou mayest dig brass and when thou Hast eaten and art full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good lamb which he gives to thee amen now you recognize when the bread fell in the wilderness it was only a testing ground it was a testing bread their attitude toward the falling of the bread determined how much of this they were going to get later on amen that's right amen if their attitude was I don't like that old shouting and that coming to church and worshiping and praising then chances are they wouldn't experience the fullness of what God had laid in store from but for those that could pass the bread test Oh Oh Glory to God those that could pass the testing of bread now remember these same this same bread of Christ that would go in there there would be certain types of bread that the priests would bring into the Tabernacle and they'd have the loaves laying out there in the second quarter the second section of the Tabernacle and in that second part they would have the bread but then there would be the bread of his face now you remember in the book of Isaiah when he says arise and shine for thy light is come talking to us Gentiles the word that he uses there for arise and shine in the original Hebrew means to become the light to rise and become the light of the face the light of the face is that any Wonder children of God that the Holy Spirit appeared to us in 1963 not as a body not as an arm not as a leg not as an ear but he appears to us as a face and it wasn't rocket ship smoke either yeah the prophet said that's our Lord up there and I believe it I believe amen no all of this that they were going to enter into so it was more than just partaking of just the bread itself but it was a testing of whether or not they wanted to enter into the fullness I feel so religious I'm about to shout right now Hallelujah to God glory to God Amen brother Isaiah knows that I go to shaking my head you look out amen amen amen now you realize then that once they got a hold of this Holy Ghost bread that as that priest would enter into that Tabernacle and he would partake today that it would be a type not just for him but for every generation of priests that went behind that Veil could partake of the same bread and it would be just as fresh it would be just as real amen it would be just as good as it was the very first time it fell the rest of them organizations didn't understand what you was haing about well if I had to eat a stale bread with maggots in it I probably wouldn't be too happy about coming to church either amen that's the reason why some people come to church looking like they do cuz they're they're hooked up on Pon juice they're hooked up on Lemon they lemon IVs but brother we're not hooked up on lemons oh no but he said in this land is honey Amen in this land is the honey of that word that brings forth the bread of his face thank you Lord Jesus oh my brother man says every believer that will break my that curtain Yonder has a right to a real oldfashioned Pentecostal blessing say what you want to but I am a true Pentecostal not modern day now come on somebody not modern dayu but I am a true original Pentecostal Oh Glory to God listen up down there devil I'm about to skin you up praise the Lord now notice in Acts chap 2:38 when Peter on the day of Pentecost gives the inaugural address of the church he says this promise is unto you unto your children brother it ain't just to me but it's to your kids too if God ever makes you a promise don't you let go on that if God ever holds something dear to your heart say Amen it's mine look how God didn't just promise it to one generation of people but he said to you and your children and your children's children and as many as the Lord Our God shall call brother I'm not looking for just me to get the blessing but I want to get so full that it spills all it spills all and my children's children's children get it if the Lord te it some people are so selfish with this Holy Ghost I want just enough for me I want just enough for what I've got let me tell you I don't want just enough for me I I want enough for that little woman sitting there for my two girls back home amen come on somebody I want enough for the Bible study group I want enough for the church I want enough for the center on the street I want as much as the Lord my God can give me and remember before you can give it you got to have it well praise the Lord I didn't go over too well with some folks cuz you know you think you can give it without getting it come on now I tell tell you you better get saved you better get the Holy Ghost what's your experience with God look like praise the Lord are you born again of the Holy Ghost have you got an early experience with God are you in today and out tomorrow brother you better hold still before you try to tell somebody else how to get it yes sir you better hold still you better wait until you know yourself that you have crossed into that ribon Veil and you have partaken of that bread of life yourself you know God sent a prophet is is that your Revelation or your mama's brother Ram was Malachi 4 whose Revelation is that come on friends as we go on in time you're going to find out a lot of these people around the message didn't have their Revelation they had Mama's Revelation and Daddy's Revelation come on now they had everybody's Revelation except for their own but before you can give this bread you've got to have it you got to have it amen you got to have it down in the depths of your soul that's and once you get into this land full of honey and you go to eatting you're going to sit in church and go good oh that is so good I don't blame you for not smacking your lips when you've been eating PR semmons all week come on now I don't blame you for for coming to church and looking like that big old long mule face like some people do in church I'm just so happy to be here wonder if we ask the devil what his opinion would be if he would say you're happy cuz I want you to know something I don't want my testimony just to ReSound in heaven that's right but I want my testimony to show up in hell as well oh glory to God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus listen to this and speak to the Rock brother R says now brother every man or woman that comes into this Divine holy priesthood has a right to get a genuine heartful of the original baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now you take Revelation chapter one you look at verse 10 you'll find John saying I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now brother man tells us in the church age book that if a man John had to get in the spirit to get them Visions then we have to be in the spirit to understand them yeah Glory now that doesn't mean that you need to fire up a new Mp3 player or have some kind of refurbished deal or whatever it might be oh I tell you I'll understand this message once I study everything brother B said on the Rapture brother there are going to be people that will take this Rapture that could barely explain it they wouldn't understand a plus b they don't understand it all they know is they're going in it Oh Glory I may not be able to figure out the Holy Ghost but I got it I may not be able to figure it out but I got it I got it I got the Holy Ghost I may not be able to figure the Rapture out but I'm going in itall amen by the grace of God I'm going in the rure of the Resurrection brother B said the same signs same power well now you know brother Ben uh you know this is Lady o see and all and you know we're kind of living in a day it's a little bit different than everybody else right the age of the greater Overcomer you say what you want to but I refuse to live a survivor's life am I refuse to live a survivor's life I am not a Survivor but by the grace of God I am an overcomer Amen to the Lamb of God I am an overcomer by the grace of God hallelujah somebody pray for me I can make it back to church Wednesday I'm just draging along that's cuz you're eating bimmons bimmons ain't got no life-giving substance in it ain't got no power in it praise the Lord amen that's why the world is falling in love with a little Walt Disney tune Frozen because it reflects their character amen they're frozen they're frozen look at them sit in church you preach the Holy Ghost they get mad at you and they're the ones going to hell not you they're the ones on the way to reaches the Lost not you but you preach the Holy Ghost that's sat get mad at you don't you dare talk to me about shouting I'm a quiet person that's God I worship Jesus and spirit out in truth what truth what truth oh lord well praise the Lord all right let me just read you a little something Psalm 47 clap your hands all you people hallelujah good what's the matter with some of you can't obey the word it said all all you people oh some of you still ain't better better now we're talking about truth right you said you worship according to the truth well I just read you truth I ain't done yet oh [Applause] shout good good now we're worshiping in [Applause] truth oh it goes on and God gets to shout and after a while cuz that's the way my daddy likes it he hears you getting blessed he sees you getting blessed glory to God he sees you getting blessed and God gets blessed amen friends where do we get this stuff from in the Bible it's the devil trying to sober us up cuz he knows our rights are behind that Veil back there oh is't it appropriate that you got a veil hanging here into this inner sanctuary that's where Christ comes notice the same power and the church said the same demonstration the same feeling amen that sounded more like an old me than it did an amen now you sure you believe this believer got a rightness veil you sure you don't want that Pimon religion because if you do you ain't got the same feeling but if you want this original it's got the same feeling open B we don't go by feelings really do you use that principle in your marriage maybe that's why your marriage is such a mess huh what if you walked in the door Hi how are you doing good how are you have a good day no you no would that be a happy marriage but now when you've been on a trip you know how it is brother Brooks when you're away and you ain't sing for a little while you come walking in the door let me tell you Song of Solomon is a Boy Scout you know what I'm saying that man that man was a childish game compared to the tapestry that I weave of sweet nothing to my little bride oh when I walk in the door she's got better than eyes like this and teeth like that but I love her so good now how do I show it how do I show her that I love her by my feeling so we've got around the ring this message we come in church and we said teach me something how could I teach you anything in this word and you truly understand it if you're not in the same spirit that it was given in now remember this when John is on the a of patmas he's out in the middle of this alcatra as brother called it if you'll take the circumference the island I think is about 15 miles across it's about 30 miles from the closest place right in the aan sea and all these little CTS and mountains and all these little places kind of a flat but it's a sort of a mountainous kind of a hilly type place little rocky places what we'd say like little mini mountains and have caves little Grotto and they say that John was up underneath this little Grotto when he receiv received his Revelation there were snakes poisonous snakes all kinds of lizards scorpions could kill him in a moment had all of that there was no holiday in there was no Ryan's Buffet there wasn't no clean pairs of clothes there wasn't no maid service or room service there wasn't anything that he could fall back on for the Comforts of Life didn't have no food didn't have no water didn't have any other hope except for death in this natural natur body and John says these words I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now will somebody please tell me how a man in that condition can get in the spirit and we sit here and argue with the preacher the whole time he tells us to shout you know what it goes to prove our stinking rotten attitudes around this message has grieved away the moving of the holy spirit because we have taken in control of our own hands we have taken in control the moving of the spirit of God we've controlled how he wants us to shout how he wants us to live how he wants us to love how he wants us to clap our hands how he wants us to worship we control it all but yet we want to be closer to God but how we want to get closer to God is we want to have a better memorization of what we read we want to read deeper memorize better but if you don't get in the spirit it isn't going to amount to enough well praise the Lord brother Brooks I believe with all my heart people around this message are blaspheming the Holy Ghost setting right and message churches blaspheming God am because they hate emotional worship Hallelujah well you did run well what's the matter some of y'all the word's Amen in case you forgot it that's right I'm still preaching the message go check me out you think I'm off the word check me out go back and look at what Paul said the way that is called crazy that's the way I worship [Music] Glory not the way that is called sane and sober and you see back in Ohio brother Brooks and I kind of hail from in our own way they got in this thing where they all clap in unison you know what I'm saying everybody claps in unison and that's an easy way to keep from shouting because they can clap at a ball game but you don't hear them say Amen in a ball game so you know what people have gotten into formalized worship and that same thing that hits my folks back home they find it in Tennessee find it in Michigan find it all you know what it is brother told us the devil has come into the church and he made a promise to God I will make this church formal and Powerless so when you come to the house of God and resist worship you're giving the devil his wish you are fulfilling the devil's desire in your life so if it's all right with y'all I want to shut him up a little [Applause] bit but says the same feeling same demonstration same Power Glory he says the same action as long as your feet are hitting the ground living holy how about it I don't mean making mistakes now what Satan has done has told you now you better not shout you know you should only shout as high as you live really what does that mean exactly so that means if I'm making mistakes doing things wrong and I'm constantly repenting and the blood of Christ completely forgives me huh that means I can come back to church and Shout right that means I can come back raise my hands amen glory to God hallelujah but you say I make mistakes you're right but the way I live is I Repent therefore I shout as high as I live amen Oh Glory to God now this is the way I want my life to be Matthew 21:22 and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive Oh Glory to God now friends that doesn't mean that you got to just burn the walls out of the place but that means that you listen some people are wide open in church like this they are wide open they are wide open I mean they are wide open you could take them to a ball game and they would probably go that's them they're wide open but brother however God Made You sister however God made you give that to [Applause] God but listen to me now don't use that as an excuse to sit there and do nothing either we get angry at people and we lose our temper and we lose our emotions with our temper don't we huh do things we don't want to do say things act in ways we didn't expect to act you know why because whenever we got angry we perceived that what we felt was important I wonder if we reverse that when we come to the house of God if we would perceive that what Jesus wants out of our life is the most important thing I wonder if it wouldn't give us pause and give us an an opportunity to stop and give vent to that which Jesus wants listen to me Jesus wants your worship he wants you to say amen he wants you to raise your hands he wants you to clap your hands he wants you to give your part into the service you know why because once you enter into the spirit he can start revealing himself to you in order for me to talk to this man in genuine Fellowship I've got to get his presence first I've talked to him on the phone for about 20 years now him and I have had conversation after conversation but it's only when we get in the presence of one another can I really begin to feel what he feels and see what he sees you understand me it's only when you begin to get in the presence the real genuine presence come on somebody amen come on somebody it's only when you g would get in the presence of almighty God that's the only way that you can feel what he feels and see what he sees believe us thou this brother said I look down at them children of Israel immediately after that they need food to live on so God rain down food out of Heaven Mana type of the Holy Ghost every morning they went out and picked it up it was good they eat it it tastes like honey they would just lick their lips and eat it I'll tell you this holy ghost that Rains Down was a type of this is the antitype he says it tastes like honey not prons now but honey not lemons now but honey you ever seen somebody stick their hand down in an old jar of honey and go this is the awfulest stuff I've ever tasted in my life they're just sitting there going they got their hand in the Honey Jar they're just licking they love every minute of it and if you try to take it away from them they'll get mad at you do you give me that back that's my jar of honey I'm not going to let you have it you took the one last week this is mine oh the children of God would be like that in the house of God when the Holy Spirit is raining down they say bring it here Lord bring it here I want it I want it let me have that blessing let me have that Taste of Honey amen amen oh praise the Lord Brother B said I've seen the saints of God so drunk on it till they would just lick their lips and say good he says that's right there's something about honey I know some of you non-emotional people I've give you something you can do you can lick your lips and in church you can say um I'm good just lick your lips brother I know what's going on you're eating some of that honey oh I don't know brother Ben I I I you know I read that over you're reading that without being in the spirit your Revelation is breeding worms and stinking do you realize that's why the Bible doesn't enthuse people as they read it while it's in a an unano condition if I can say it that way it doesn't have the spirit on it but you start getting caught up in the anointing oh my brother Brooks was preaching just a little teaching a little bible study this morning I got so caught up I like to shout it amen he was talking about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the higher he got the higher I got and the more he talked the more I listen I was just sitting there going good Hallelujah you know why I was in the spirit of what brother was bringing but you come to church and you go well let's just see what he'll say to us this morning maybe he'll tell us something good that we can hear I can see you don't eat on honey like you should cuz if you ever get in that Honey Jar honey let me tell you something when you walk through them back doors you're saying I wish he sings Too Many songs come on come on get to it brother Ben we know you want to share that singing part but come on get to that work glory amen why it's honey to the believer could you imagine them sitting there getting so drunk did just sit in the house of God and just [Music] go that's good oh my notice again he says brother he said it's like a Russian Mighty Wind come from Heaven amen he says it fills all the house where they're setting Hallelujah the brother they said the building brother wasn't big enough to hold them amen I believe there's a misconception around the ranks of this message I believe what we see when we see small church I believe we see small churches and we think to oursel well you know small churches represents failure actually I think we're looking at it wrong I think Mt pews is there because God knows we're going to need some shoting room so God don't fill the church up so you have room to be able to spread out let Len Eagles aren't cooped in no Barnyard come on now they've got to have room to spread their wings out glory to God so we look at it wrong we think why aren't why isn't the church full because they're going to take up your Sho room if you lay an empty hand on an empty head come on somebody set a bunch of people in the church that don't love God they'll take up your shouting space Glory to God tell me I'm eating for Simmons bless God I'll tell you one thing I'm as happy as I can be I know I can tell I can tell now notice now brother man says the building wasn't big enough to hold him he says out to the streets they went [Music] singing so we've got licking our lips singing two things you can do that don't involve jumping hollering and agre praise the Lord Brother B says jumping I'm back to Jumping again lick your lips I'm I'm good singing and jumping dancing yes sir Allelujah now this is all your rights behind this Veil now listen to me I'm not expecting I'm not preaching this because I expect you to tear the walls out of this place this morning no no that's up to you you do what you want to do don't jump any higher than you normally jump don't amen any louder than you normally amen all I want you to know is this is your rights so in my rights is umam good tastes like honey and in my rights is singing jumping and dancing and licking my lips which one of y'all going to get [Music] started praise the Lord this is my rights this is my rights brother I said this is my rights brother keth brother B says could you imagine wait a minute sister the Virgin Mary was in there too and she was acting like she was drunk now why don't the Catholics depict her that way why don't we see a statue with marry like this you know why they wouldn't have such a a child in their denomination amen they don't want that they want formalized religion where you come you do your religion pay your money and go home amen do you honestly think that's what God wanted for us in this message just to show up in a church to give our money out to give our time out and sit there in the house of God and not move why do you think Martin Luther was responsible for starting the Reformation to give us back congregational sin and give us back communion with the with the bread and the wine and give us back the worship of the Saints and give us back all of these why do you think God restored it back cuz he wanted you to have it cuz it was in your rights amen it was in your rights as a child of God could you imagine saying that in a Catholic Church could you imagine me walking up to one of the Pope's big sanctuaries today stepping up to the platform and say friends I just want to let you know something our Blessed Virgin Mary ha Mary she's drunk in heaven right now Glory could you imagine saying that to some of them Pious men with them robes on I so thankful God didn't call me to wear no robe I have a hard enough time shouting with a tie unless that's a robe i' tear them up brother amen I get to popping and moving and shaking my head i' blow the collar out I rip the sleeves off glory to God why because that's my right that's my right as a child of God to be follow of the Holy Ghost Hall amen it's my right as a child of God to have this blessed Holy Ghost promise could you imagine saying that in a Methodist Church Baptist Presbyterian or somewhere now why wouldn't you be able to say that very freely because you'd be contradicting the way they act Hallelujah so if you couldn't say that in a message meod IST church Baptist Church Catholic church or Presbyterian wonder if that same attitude hasn't crept in most people in the message well I couldn't say these type of things in certain message churches because they'll say I'm worshiping God in spirit and in truth I'll ask you again what truth are you worshiping by my God is an emotional God do you realize brother R said of all the human emotions that Jesus exhibited when he was here he wept all the time he constantly cried do you know what that means that means some of you big Arnold Schwarz and Egger tough guys you've got a right to cry if you feel like crying I know Mama and Daddy might have called you a but not in God's kingdom my Daddy won't call you no no sir but my Daddy loves you to cry my Jesus loves you to pour out your tears amen the Virgin Mary was under the influence of the Holy Ghost staggered like somebody was drunk if God made the mother of Jesus Christ go up there to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost before she could get to heaven you'll never get there anything shorter than that so you might as well get the starch out of your collars and come on now you realize my Jesus believes in Bleach but he don't believe in starch he believes in Bleach his blood is a bleach that washes our sins away glory to God he believes in Bleach brother Keith but he don't believe in starch amen get the starch out of your collar and come on he said some of y'all hoping it's going to get better just going to be more of the same see might as well Buckle in I'm pretty much got my feet stuck in the mud and I'm singing I shall not be moved this morning paragraph 182 brother man said what do does that represent to us all right when they all got drunk on this new Mana so we read didn't we see the priest going in the way we see the priest we see him walking in holy holy holy I wonder sometimes the Ringle what reason them Jingle Bells were jingling is because that priest didn't already have him a Nipper to that spirit for he went in there I'm coming Jehovah give me a moment coming you said that's sacrilegious no it's not it's my rights am it's my rights the problem is not what I'm preaching it's our concept of what we believe the true spirit of God is listen I realize there's a lot of fanaticism in Emotion but listen why do we put it on the Shelf all together why do we get rid of emotion all together answer me that question and I'll tell you where the devil's been hiding at for the last 30 years around the ranks of this message hiding in formalism yes sir right do you realize why some of these people are defecting out leaving the message because they didn't want this you can say Amen or not but I'm telling you right now that's the reason they're leaving the message because they didn't want this they didn't want it they didn't want that Holy Ghost unction they didn't want the power of God where they lose control and fly out that Holy Spirit inspiration and unction of God they didn't want it so they come to church trying to reform themsel like a good Catholic or a good Methodist setting in a message church amen and never understood what brother bradam really taught it isn't just a recent Pastor that most everybody knows that quit I was out on the field just a little while back and a brother called me said brother Ben I want to tell you something I said yes sir he said I met a pastor in the off in the uh grocery store the other day Supermarket I said asked him how he was doing he said yes sir he said I'm doing all right now since I quit following that false prophet William Brandon he said brother what do you mean he said I pastored a church for better than 30 years and never believed in the right way that I should have believed because it was false it was a bunch of Lies he said and you know where they're getting their information they're going to the internet listen to me carefully the internet is neither good nor bad it is neutral it's what you do with it just like a tape recorder just like any other device you use it is neutral just like this little tablet I use for my sermon notes it is neutral it's what you use it for but listen to me I do not find my answers for the last day truth on the internet I do not find my answers on Facebook I do not find my Revelation by what somebody told me there's one place I [Applause] [Music] look right here right here that old blessed word that's where the bride looks amen hallelujah I said that in church not long back and come to find out there was a little sister sitting there been looking on the internet and her her mother-in-law said you mean to tell me you told brother Ben that I'd been searching this out on the internet how do I I said I wasn't you didn't tell me nothing she said the Holy Ghost is the one that told her to be that amen that's where people are getting messed up they're looking for more information to prove what information they already have to either prove or disprove information but brother the Bible is not information the scripture is revelation and how how do you get Revelation tell me tell me how you get it you got to get in the spirit Glory you got to amen amen you've got to get in the spirit to get revelation I went to this website and that website and I heard this guy say and I heard that guy say and I heard this fell say and that fell say but what about the main fell what about the main website what' Jesus say about it let me ask you something brother and sister when's the last time you got down on your face before God and you prayed until your spirit was refreshed until the Holy Ghost just came right down where you were at and begin to envelop your soul and speak right directly to your heart amen people don't even say God spoke to me anymore websites talk but God don't talk anymore praise the Lord somebody praise the Lord somebody come on now don't get quiet on me it ain't the website that says it ain't the bishop that says it ain't the priest that says but it's the word it's the holy ghost that says excuse this but just like our precious brother bringing the interpretation I'm trying to go slow so you can get it that he is The Interpreter of what I'm saying as I say it he's telling the brother that's the way the Holy Ghost is to me if I want to know something about the word if I want to know something about the bridge if I want to know something about the brown bear if I want to know something about the Rapture if I want to know something about the Holy Ghost I just get God's interpreter the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God I just get God's interpreter in my soul and I let the Holy Ghost interpreted to me let me say this to you not because I planned it but because I feel the Holy Ghost is in itall I as a Son of God reject their interpretations of brother brother Bam's Life as a Son of God I reject their interpretation of the bridge I reject their interpretation of the brown bear I reject their interpretation of his birth certificate I reject it and as a Son of God I accept that this was Malachi 4 I accept that this is revelation 10 I accept brother Isaiah that this was Luke 17 and3 the days of the sering of the sonn man amen hallelujah I reject what they say listen to me children you're not helpless you're not helpless you don't have to sit in front of that computer screen and accept what they say but that's the spirit that's behind these men they want you to sit there and you feel the pressure coming from that demon anointing you must accept it you must accept it it must be the truth it's got to be the truth and you sat there under that pressure but listen to me in the name of Jesus Christ as a Son of God I reject their interpretation I refuse I reject what they say about it I do not have to accept their thesis I do not have to accept their belief but you go to ww.go straight hell.com and you get in there and you grab a hold of some of their websites and that demon anointing will sit there and pull on you you must accept what we're saying what we're saying is the truth that you that devil will sit there and tell you you know everybody's really under all this fanaticism all these people are really being deceived they're really being deceived but as a Son of God I felt the Holy Ghost moved to me the other day brother Brooks and I felt the spirit of God say do you accept or do you reject and I said to the Lord as a Son of God I reject I reject I do not have to obey or listen to what they say would I rather obey men or obey God that's the true Pentecostal blessing i reject what they have to say I reject their interpretation of this message you can go right to brother Ram's own life story and you can find discrepancies in his dates for brother B to have the vision of the bridge he told it he'd have had to been 14 years old not seven I can find where brother Brandon misquoted dates I can find where brother Brandon made errors in his understanding but that didn't stumble me not one bit you know why not because of a man that could remember the day or remember a time period but when I go to looking in that word oh bless the Lord hold my soul and all that is within me when I go to looking in that word you tell me it's serpent seed right or wrong I accept that the serpent had a seed you go to looking in the word tell me if that Jesus is one person or three I accept that Jesus Christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily tell me where women preachers show up in the Bible I accept that brother badam preached the truth just as Paul preached [Applause] it I accept water baptism in Jesus Christ's name I accept that a woman can't cut her hair I accept that a man can't live in adultery I accept Holiness I said I accept Holiness I reject their idea that there's freedom in such things and I accept the truth of the Bible that says without Holiness without Holiness no man shall see the Lord this is my my rights and let me say to you Church of the Living God listen to me carefully and you just remember some little idiot prophesied to you before this church is ever going to move Beyond this critical spirit she's going to have to receive the same behaviors that they did in Acts chapter 4 amen amen if you will study in the fourth chapter of Acts at the first persecution of the church when the church was being criticized not by message people but by critics on the outside when they were being persecuted then the Lord Jesus himself was waiting for them to pray and ask God to fill their mouth with boldness that they may speak now listen to me if we're ever going to overcome that devil that's assaulted this message Jesus is waiting on you to pray you have not cuz you ask not but if you want this original then you're going to have to get down on your face before God and start praying as they did and saying Lord fill my mouth with boldness that I may speak remember one of those Sevenfold personages of Jesus Christ was the living voice remember the voice that preceded forth out of his mouth the voice was not just the repeating of scripture but it was the living voice it was the same voice that called Lazarus from the dead it was the same voice that created the sun moon and stars and remember brother said this bride would become the final voice not just a voice that repeats scripture but she would become the living voice of God now Jesus is sitting in heaven and saying children just pray just ask me to fill your mouth with boldness you just remember before it happens when saints of God in this message go to asking him for boldness our Jesus is going to come to battle like you've never seen before you know why because this last day shaking is running all them formal little parasites out here hallelujah oh Brethren you notice every time Jesus went to telling his disciples the most intimate details of him he always got him away from the crowd amen and pulled him to a secret chamber by himself you think you've heard things yet you just wait till leave thins this crowd out a little bit more and then Jesus will tell us things out of his very own heart out of his very own heart brother Brooks that we've never heard before in our life my God my God do you understand what's getting ready to drop on the elect it will be more than just a revelation of a prophet more than just a revelation of a bride but it will be the very living voice speaking out of the mouth of the people you say what do this got to do with being drunk I don't know but it's good anyhow I'll stay with it amen he says all right they got drunk on that new Mana Moses never said bake a few loaves tonight they didn't have nothing to bake with they were aliens pilgrims strangers God reigned It Out of Heaven just as he's reigned the Holy Ghost out on us amen now mind you when I come to church I don't want to just get a few drops on my head huh but I want to be like that fellow what was his name that sang Singing in the Rain you know what I'm talking about he had his rain cat on his umbrella and he was out there splashing in the puddles and he was swinging around the poles oh come on you high you holy people people you know what I'm talking about he was swinging Every Which of Direction he was singing he was getting covered over there's one difference between him and I he didn't go far enough I wouldn't had a raincoat I wouldn't have had no umbrella no sir glory to God but when I got in the presence of the Lord I would have been sitting there Singing in the Rain don't bring me no umbrella okay don't bring me no umbrella don't bring me no rainco cuz I ain't going to use it amen that's why when I come in I come in nice and dry and I leave like this praise the Lord glory to God thank you Jesus listen this to the ministry of Christ brother man said now notice how that God blessed and promised he'd be down he said for who for you for your children your children showing them that a far off man the Lord Our God shall call he said Connorsville Indiana wherever it might be if God is still calling he said he's still giving to every priest and then he asked the question are we a priest amen he says a royal priesthood a holy nation coming to God offering spiritual sacrifices what the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name Lord I can understand why some people frown because their fruit is for Simmons their fruit is lemons limes the fruit of their lips has always been sour but I've got to raise my hands because if I don't that preacher will get all over me I've got to say Amen because other people will think something's wrong with me if they're Christians they sure will if they're born again they will think something is wrong with that brother or that sister when I see people sit in the house of God defeated I realize something's wrong with you amen amen brother you say what are you calling Victory I'm calling anything that don't look like this Victory I can eat a piece of apple pie because I know what it looks like y'all going to help me preach or what amen if I don't know what it looks like I'm gonna be in awful lot of trouble but I could eat a chocolate cake because I know what it looks like and I know what victory looks like and it don't look like somebody going I remember that white boy he's the one that preaches a long time in yeah that's me I'm the one Amen brother B said the fruit of our lips now don't we want fruit what is our fruit love joy peace longsuffering meekness generous patience would you be eating the fruits of love looking with a good old just a soured up expression on your face you don't have the right fruit yet if you have the right fruit of peace and joy and you're eating from the fruits of your experience when you are eating from the fruits of your experience Oh Glory something ought to react out of you brother sister something out of you when you see love coming out of you amen oh my brother Randy when you see it moving out of you you ought to be able to take a hold of that gospel fruit and go good says I'm slobbering a whole lot this afternoon you know what's the matter I'm over in Canan eating some of these new grapes praise the Lord I like that had to Runway when I read that he says I'm getting just as drunk as I can be amen it causes you to slobber Hallelujah I'm I'm good taste like honey sing jump dance shout clap your hands and slobber that's at least seven things some of you could do come on somebody that's at least seven things you can do in the house of God I'd write one of them books seven ways to bless God when you're in a mess's church my doctor no I didn't mean that I'm sorry I'm getting just as drunk you see that's the kind of girl you should be looking for boys one that slobbers in church now I know when you sisters are looking for a husband you're looking for the boy that sits in church very prim and proper and when he's in church he eats on the word and he makes sure that he's kemped when he's in the house of God I know that's way some of you sisters look but you know what you should be looking for you should be looking for a brother that's froing at the mouth when he's sitting in the house of God Amen and brother you know the kind of woman you should be looking for one that does the same thing you're doing you take a slobberer that marries a nons slobber they have all kinds of trouble when they get home because after he gets done shouting his shoe shoes heels off his shoes off as it were and he gets back to the he gets in the car no more than he's clicked the door I can't believe you embarrassed the devil out of me if he had any backbone he would say that's what I was trying to do oh glory to God amen amen if he had any backbone at all he' said that's what I was trying to do embarrass the devil out of you got in church and you screamed so loud you hurt my ears listen at this statement enticing Spirits brother B says here is men and women kneeling here at the altar they have been Christians for years years I'm not UNC christianizing them but what I'm trying to do is tell them that the devil is haunting them trying to keep them out of full Joy so that's why when some people come to church they feel they feel like they can't they feel like they can't raise they feel like they can't Rejoice you know what that is that's a devil standing there haunting you you better not you better not the minute you start moving people will thank your thank you what Christian Glory praise the Lord let the devil know what your [Music] ass if you went to a ball game and the Cincinnati Reds were playing their their big rivals the St Louis Cardinals and I know because that's all the talk they talked about time and time and time again when I used to work the SEC job that is and they'd have this rivalry could you imagine a real Cincinnati Red leg fan I mean just a died in a wool red leg fan he is a genuine red leg they were the first baseball team bless God they're the best and the St Louis Cardinals got up there and they pitched them the fastest fast ball they could pitch and one of their star hitters gets a hold of it and knocks the cover off the ball nothing but a little string of yarn just floating out in outer space could you imagine that real dyed in the wool fan sitting there and going that's it I'm done that's what they do would you sit over there in the corner and say that guy's a real fan he really loves the Cincinnati RS he loves them look at him he's got his hat right his dress is right he's got Reds material all over him but wouldn't you begin to wonder if he was covered from head to toe in Reds paraphernalia if when they hit that big major home run if he didn't move would you wonderen amen now the world has better sense than we do because they know that when they get these starchy bunch of people into the into the arena that in order for them to get happy enough to scream at them places they have a guy going around going beer here that's what I'm doing this morning Jesus here Jesus here anybody want Jesus anybody want a temp of that Holy GH house glory to God anybody want the power of the Pentecostal Revival you let them get drunk enough and you know what they'll get so drunk that before long they'll be shouting for the wrong team man man sit down that's the wrong boy I don't care glory to God they know get them full of spirits and they'll rejoice and that's the principle I'm trying to preach to you this morning get full of the spirit and then you will bless the Lord your God can I go a bit further thank you appreciate it go quick don't give them a chance to say no I'm having too good of a time I don't want to quit either brother B says he's haunting them keeping them out of full joy and listen to this remark full Joy so full Joy wasn't just sitting there hearing the prophet preach full Joy wasn't just kneeling at the altar at the feet of a prophet of God worshiping and asking God to help you but full Joy was them moving into the full abundance listen at brother bram's very next words if you doubt that he's talking about emotion listen to this very next sentence he said the Holy Ghost is Joy I wake up drunk I go to bed drunk drunk I'm drunk all day long and I'm drunk all night long so if you thought brother Ram's definition of full Joy was deeper Revelation you're wrong you're wrong it wasn't a deeper understanding of a mystery praise the Lord amen it wasn't well I memorized this and I was able to put this Doctrine together and I figured out how this quote fits with that quote but it was the Revelation itself from Christ not just a mental Revelation but it was the depth of how that revelation ation affected the human heart and once that Revelation began to move and turn brother said I wake up drunk I go to bed drunk I'm drunk all day and I'm drunk all night amen listen some of you people have trouble with these filthy dreams that the devil puts on us sometimes if you would go to bed drunk that' take care of your dreaming problems we all have them we all have them because if the devil can't get you while your eyes are awake he'll awake he'll wait till you go to sleep to attack you but if you go to bed drunk amen if you go to bed drunk the devil can't assault you there Psalm 348 notice what he says I'm going wait let Randy get it up it's too good to speed on by Psalm 348 Hallelujah isn't it amazing when you get in the spirit I don't even have to explain it to you amen [Laughter] hallelujah thank you Holy Ghost I didn't have to tell you one thing all you did is read I never said a word you know why you got it cuz you're in the spirit I'm not even going to comment on it Proverbs Chapter 24: 13 notice Proverbs chap 24:13 watch this next verse my son don't eat it because it makes you deeper don't eat it because it gives you a better understanding the message just eat it because it's good s Solomon Chapter 2 verse3 Song of Solomon Chapter 2:3 this is actually kind of fun I don't get to add actually this is the first time I I'm preaching without having to preach this is kind of nice figure out how to make this work all over the country would be business won't so Song of Solomon Chapter 2:3 read it some of you slower readers than others I understand now this this is what Jesus wants for us friends he wants us to have that kind of relationship where we sat down under the tree not so we can become more educated but because we can taste of sweet FL praise the Lord praise the Lord listen to this in The Exodus message brother man says notice when we're all eating that Mana he said they got drunk just as drunk as they could be he said staggering like drunk men listen my Catholic friend the Virgin Mary is with them if she had to get that before she entered into heaven how much more you're going to have to have it you know what the trouble is the reason we're so allergic to so many things we don't get drunk enough he says you believe that now my sister-in-law Rebecca is allergic to mold if she walked into this building and smelled it in the air she would break out all over she's terribly deafly allergic to mold but they in order to keep her from having an allergic reaction they must pump her full of inoculation and once she's full of inoculation she can walk anywhere there's mold and just smile and just grin that's the reason we have so many allergic ladios reactions come on now that's the reason we have so many allergic reactions in lady OA because we're not full enough we're not drunk enough so the guy cut you off in the in the parking lot you get so mad at him you'd pull his goozle out of his nose if you could that devil don't he know I'm on the way to church cut me off it's a devil it's a devil you stomp in the back door you're just as mad as you can be you shed out of the house of God what's the matter with you somebody cut me off on the way to church I believe most message people need delivering some road rage I do they sure do but you see you take a man that gets super duper dupery dupery drunk you let somebody cut him off they'd be cutting him off one after another and he's going hello hello hello hello hello hi how y'all how y'all come see us sometime glory glory to the Lamb of God hallelujah you understand children this is why we need to become drunk on the Holy Ghost amen daddies Mama listen to me how much would your children really bother you if you was a drunk parent huh would they get on your nerves as bad if you was laying into that Holy Ghost new wine that wife of yours bother you so bad if you were drunk on the Holy Ghost vice versa husband what about mom-in-law what about dad-in-law what about the pastor what about the deacons if you were drunk enough not even your worst enemy could break that intoxication oh God please Jesus let us have it Lord we need it God we need it is the hour is approaching brother man says he quotes from Paul now be not drunk upon strong drinks which is excise excess but be drunk on the spirit what's the matter today is we ought to get so drunk till our carcasses will be so full of the Holy Ghost till nothing else can perch in its way the trouble of it is we don't get on a good oldfashioned Pentecostal drunk amen I know we want to be sociable drinkers when we come to church stick our little finger out that's enough for me I'm done now I I've said my five amens in the service as I've told you before some people have an amen quota some have two amens in church they amen when the guy says let's stand and start church amen and then their last amen they hold it in all service long they wait till the preachers done preaching they wait for the exact moment he'll say now let us be dismissed amen now we laugh but do you think that's what Jesus wants for you do you think that's the kind of life he wants to hand us he wants so much more than that for us I said he wants so much more than that for us foreal let me read this in this close the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate it brings a person all slumped down all slumped down slump down you know nobody loves me at that church I went to that church and nobody shook my hand did you show yourself friend when people went to go shake your hand did you look at them like a copperhead getting ready to bite its prey praise the Lord huh did you show yourself did you make yourself available that they'd be the kind of person that you could be the kind of person that they could approach or was y'all slum over nobody loves me nobody cares for me but listen brother B says it brings a person all slumped down to a stimulation now there's a power of the revelation of the word that gives stimulation of Joy to the believer amen this is brothery he says stimulation of satisfaction stimulation that has been Vindicated stimulation that has been proved and it's called as the scriptures we want to refer to it that's new wi so you mean to tell me I can have a stimulation and be satisfied amen I can have a stimulation and know and know that it's been Vindicated amen why would brother B say these words if he didn't know we would need him later on if the Holy Ghost didn't know we would need them in the hour that everybody's questioning Vindication why would brother B say these words like this the Holy Ghost let him do because when a person gets drunk on new wine they will be satisfied and so drunk on the Vindication of the word he said we like to refer to it these are drunk on new wine he said or spiritual wine I think the best interpretation would be spiritual wine so stimulation Revelation produces stimulation so the more revelated people should be the more stimulated people that's the more revelated people should be more the stimulated people the more revelated people should be the more stimulated people the more revelated people should be more assimilated people the more revelated people should Beall I know I'm not very fair preacher am I just pin you down and don't let you move so why is it then the people around the ranks why are they the less stimulated and yet they claim to be the more revelated they got more Revelation than they've ever had and they're more miserable than they've ever been they've got more truth than they've ever had and they're more sad than you've ever seen in the life they just walk around just a big old thing on their face all the time people actually believe there are people that actually believe I secretly take drugs did you know that they do there are people that believe that I secretly take drugs they believe that they've even said I it's got back to me word through some of my closest friends there is no way any human being can smile like he smiles and not be on something amen you know what I said I said they're exactly right but I don't just secretly get hooked up oh my God my God I don't just secretly get hooked up I get hooked up in front of you too and it ain't street drugs it ain't Pharmaceuticals it's the Holy Ghost and brother sister you get hooked up on it it'll make you do the same thing for This Promise is unto you to your children and as that is the Lord Our God sh it is the believer's rights it is the believer's rights it is the rights of the Holy Ghost filled child of God praise the Lord praise the Lord glory to the Lamb of God glory to God praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lamb of God hallelujah oh let's worship Him friends stand to your feet let's worship Jesus hallelujah hallelujah it is the believer's rights it is my rights now let me tell you something let me tell you something listen to me you may think she's out of order you may think he didn't quit preaching Hallelujah but let me show you what the benefit of being in the spirit is the very minute that I made that last remark Hallelujah my very next words was let's stand yeah amen right as God is my witness with his word right here in front of me the very last remark I made my very next statement let's stand we're done the Holy Ghost knew I was done before I said it and the spirit of God dropped on our sister the very moment I was finished you say does that matter yes because you're staying in the Rhythm in the synchronization of the moving of the spirit of God if you're sitting under a teacher and he's sitting there taking notes and he's teaching the things of the word you settle down why you fall in the rhythm of the spirit but if the anointing is moving High you move high oh if it could give us that kind of dis what could it do for our lives on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday come on somebody what could it do for us the rest of our lives if we could just fall in the rhythm of the Holy Spirit raise your hands raise your hands everybody
