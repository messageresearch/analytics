the victory last week it's still yet holding on we like to welcome all of our visitors you are at Liberty to Worship the Lord your own way here but not prolonging the time let us turn to Isaiah 62. we'll be reading two passages of scriptures excuse me 62. and the other one from Isaiah 21. foreign 's sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest unto the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burn it is and the Gentiles shall see the righteous thy righteousness and all the kings thy glory and thou shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name Thou Art Thou shalt also be crowned a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal dying them in the hand of thy God is Thou shalt no more be turned forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate for Thou shalt be called and thy land Beulah for the Lord delighteth indeed and thy land shall be married [Music] for as a Young Man married the Virgin so shall the son thy Sons Mary thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God Rejoice over thee foreign and give him no rest till he established until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth amen amen Isaiah 21 is we're just going to read the 11th and the 12th verse the burden of Dumas he called it to me out of seer Watchman what of the night Watchman what of the night um The Watchman said the morning coming and also tonight if ye will inquire inquiry return come last let us pray our Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for being so good to us Lord there has been no other something love us the way you do cannot even comprehend you can't even gonna grasp it the performance without understanding but Lord we can see it manifest before us day by day every minute of the day we thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace we thank you for the love that you bestowed upon us your father this morning Lord Jesus Christ you're the only living God we bow before you in humility in Jesus Christ's name we foreign the question was asked foreign [Music] or if there'd be anything done whether it be righteous or not if it's not done in the love and by the love of God it is not accepted and how often we 've lived by by law don't do this don't do that if you do do this God is going to punish you and I'm so afraid [Music] and because he paid foreign [Applause] it's not to uh be uh like a like a programming or system because we say if I do this this is efficiency God will be angry or Hallelujah now let me move on I'm sure I don't see we're living in a time where we needed to have light um no they cannot fully compare Sodom they cannot compare this is why God said as it was in the days and it included because we are living in a Time evil has doubled itself Hallelujah the darkness has intensified so in order to make it through this darkness and give us understanding there are many people yeah follow this message I have no idea the day that they're living foreign it went over every Observatory observator they kept the time by the Stars they kept the Times by The Stars Jesus had seven the [Music] Hallelujah because I saw the Stars a lot of people have not seen as of yet Hallelujah it was for them to see it and the wise man was star was sent for Elizabeth Hallelujah let me say it like this in Matthew 25 seconds to the message Hallelujah that place of rest as the quote goes to eat the children of Israel amen amen and they were supposed to follow Moses and Moses saw the lights what I'm trying to tell you is that that same pillars Hallelujah and then Joshua came made us one of the things about the eyes man this imagery in the great Shining Light 1957. he said they traveled by night because it was cool in the night basketball for them to travel through the desert another question in the darkness and to follow the light and the light was was there guys amen the light was their guy [Music] it was a supernatural happening if foreign Hallelujah [Applause] because it because of their gifts and they were accepted by Christ they were used in his ministry at the end of the road Hallelujah when John saw it because the Bible says hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying yes glory to God you know a lot of people believe that Canaanites were just black people yeah he didn't say he never said cursed be him he said cursed um y'all get quiet Cain was one of the sons or Cain was one of these signs Hallelujah now y'all look at it you know who the Canaanites are now you don't have to raise your hand but I'm gonna tell you who they probably they came tonight everybody that rejects the Gospels blue because he sang that song magnify the Lord with me you say God can't do that yes he came from a curse of people God blessed her then God can do what he wants to do Hallelujah now I'm coming by the grace of God because I want you to understand that the light that will to follow it's shining right now and we are participants of this great move of God I haven't done anything great Hallelujah [Music] and Moses had to do what the pillars Hallelujah it doesn't mean I believe brother Brown and to follow what he says that's the way you follow him by believing and acting the word that he spoke because she lost the DC hallelujah amen now the word of God says according to you Isaiah 62. you know what some of us we got to get over racism every time you start speaking on colors don't say the wrong thing bro Hallelujah there's only one race when you ain't God don't judge you because your skin colors you know what God asked you you received the Holy ghosts he said there is no Superior race God don't care about where you come from he don't care if your daddy was a king or a queen y'all know what I meant to say oh my point that's not the bloodline Dominion you should receive the holy ghosts we could shake this this Des Moines Iowa y'all hear what I'm saying but what we need outpouring of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah man you see every time I start talking about the Holy Ghost y'all get quiet and it makes me know you ain't got it you said I'm afraid if you can hear somebody about the Holy Ghost amen amen amen it's like what is that what just died amen the greatest thing that could ever happen to a person let me tell you something when God fills you with the Holy Ghost you'll never forget it Hallelujah just At The Mention Of The Name of Jesus yeah but we treat the name of Jesus some people treat the name of Jesus like it's just a historical name is yeah he was in history but he is alive hallelujah we're living in me Hallelujah foreign foreign you better have the word in you right now what the church is supposed to do the presence of God the sun is gone oh come on now that's why the Bible says if you have a question ask your husband at home he's supposed to teach you the words that's the word quote Acts 2 38 now just any actor but it's amazing oh my goodness I have to be careful yes sir then when the sun comes up oh that's cool and it'll tell you the church is already turned pale the gliss got away from the blood from salvation of the word [Music] we supposed to reflect God [Music] ah can you say it we're like we're like the word of God says tickling symbols fancy huh the point is when we see what we're living you know you're living in it it is the darkness of the night see it is a dark times how many of y'all believe that somebody and if that be true is this a Vine what life are we supposed to live including ourselves in the darkness are we separated from the dogs [Applause] people are supposed to see a difference hallelujah amen let them call you Holy Rollers those are words those are words are praised why is that glorified God I even had a Baptist Christian Batiste come to me and he says teach me because I want to live I want to love God the way I see you love God that was such a blessing to me and because I was trying to tell him things and but she said nevertheless just by him saying that you saw Christ in me Hallelujah let me move on I'm sorry it goes down then what happened the sun is approaching The Darkest Hour of the night is just before the die foreign you know what you need come on somebody them and they uh love back in the day you call that schizophrenic uh y'all hear what I'm saying you got children if you don't teach your children what's going to happen now y'all looking at me like I'm crazy what was the reason why Israel always fell into idolatry teach their children [Music] Amen to teach their each other what Jehovah says for chaos the Gloom but you got to understand your soul because I'm there's not one person in here I see Mr Rapture you understand me because you got to understand there's a lot of preachers who's not telling you yeah they're just telling you if you believe the message Hallelujah you got to have Resurrection powers and that Resurrection it is something that only God can give you he'll give it to you God himself your living is in vain it doesn't matter how deep you say you [Applause] he's supposed to reflect himself Hallelujah one thing for certainly you never have to train a dog how to bark oh you never have to train a cow how to give milk um we've got so many people following this message ain't no serpents going there none no no serpent no and listen we all were born with part serpent you know what I want to tell y'all yeah like he was Sanctified at Birth we are always Little Devils we live by that nature Hallelujah and if you're born of a Woman by my experience hmm because people are in the message they think they got it they think they got the Garment on them but you need the Holy Ghost comments when they came the master of the ceremony came in and he asked the man how did you get in here when they came through the door they were all given the same road is that right amen the Holy Ghost is given to everybody but a lot of people sit right in here they know what to do they know how to dress have you received it you received the Holy ghosts free foreign God has become too common to you is that right so what happens when the Morning Star goes right and the sun began to shine again because that morning star that he was there till coming of the Lord light of the sun ready to shine during that time in Isaiah they laughed at the Watchmen they say well you know he's too much gloom and doom message and the whole time cry out against sin everything that was wrong when the prophet God was here in America they laughed at him when he came to the word so he had lost his mind no that when he was killed in that accident Community felt like God it was was that was retribution but they didn't understand they didn't understand what was going on but let me say it like this we must move forward we have been in this place too long and let me tell you like this even though he's given us a land for every interview I want that Perfection not the Giants but you're allowed to get in your way that's right right right how many people I've been trying to get their relatives and it had not come to pass see that's a miracle brother same here and I'm just saying I'm just saying God has a way of doing things even you're sitting in here designing you know what I tell people tell them to go down to the Border come to the Border amen they'll take you in um put you in a hotel they give you everything you need and guess what you can steal and get caught and they won't even lock you up foreign and I'm not just trying to be funny I'm telling you the truth my ticket would have been there because if I had to travel by myself y'all looking at me and saying well y'all go down there and say well my my pastor told me let's move on by the grace I just think it's wrong the way they're doing it it's wrong I think it's so wrong people who are legally trying to get in listening it's wrong I'll tell them that is listen people I don't feel no man it's coming anyway right y'all know it's coming they know you should feel listen you could if you evil comes your way you don't address the evil evil as the person doing the evil Hallelujah let me move on by the grace I'm a jump song I'm a jump okay now we got to move on and I'm gonna see and this is where I'm going with this I was already spoken on that part what is your inheritance what did God leave you see as an inheritance one of the things that the Lord spoke to the children of Israel we're not just to live in Egypt [Music] and let me say it like this we know the land exists because we had a Joshua came back he said I've been there he didn't just bring back grapes but he brought back the report that your theophany was over there now I don't know how good that's the best way you could do it he said man for something you can talk about grapes I love grapes The Grapes don't excite me but when you talk about another land will you tell me that when I died when you tell me I cannot die don't worry about these fleshly Falls [Music] [Applause] if you continue to not know who you what your inheritance is I've got a big mansion for you we got to use a better place than California over in Florida well I'm sorry and they kind of give you a vision of what it looks like and you said over here in a two-bedroom house and over here you got four to five bedrooms your hand and the faucet turns on I mean come on well I'm not ready to move today today right let's let's let's make this thing happen soon as possible well see that's the way I'm looking at Heaven oh somebody I'm looking at my Heritage Hallelujah I'm looking in see if you're not my age you don't even know what I'm talking about wake up with pain you say you shouldn't confess it is true and I call on the name of Jesus and it gets better he said but there are times some people don't suffer those things but something and every time I think about a pain think about how close I am to death it's coming y'all know that I was telling somebody my whole point is to bring you to a place I don't care how rich you get here if you don't have Jesus Christ Jesus Christ this is not been this is not about I don't know how come I'm preaching this way but somebody your heritage and the blood is being applied not the natural blood but the life of the blood which is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he said what about a Heritage connects you to to whatever that God has left for you I I I I know in America you may have a family and they may own a big piece of land nobody can just buy that land without the family's signature everybody in the family sign the paperwork one person can't do it in person because it would take the blood of Jesus but he's the one who gave it to us now you say what do you mean because you're my inheritance I have a vision a vision that was given to me because that's the way it is when you own something Hallelujah brother random said I saw them there were Millions running toward me and every one of them was saying he said they were young they have no wrinkles Hallelujah that's what Paul said miracle most of my family die young because my mother had 16 children my mama says on phone and only three of us are living because we all die young in the 40s right my brother just that just passed before he made history did you don't know that this is the last three to four months relatives is it's in your family too it's in your family nothing Remains the Same but the thing that really caught me with my knees but I'm not sure she knew Jesus she's a nice young girl but I don't know I don't know if she knew the Lord grieved me so much I got the heart coffin thought about it do I understand what I'm saying I don't know what our inheritance is but I know mine and yours should be the same God gave Israel promised land where the streets are paved with gold Hallelujah you don't need a water filter [Music] I I I don't know about y'all but I said like this I'm almost done but I should take you another hour because you're gonna stand out there for another hour you're gonna do it it's the truth you know and I'm not trying to be funny but my pain is folks what is the this is what if you should let's say like this what if all the law should come right now oh this is not available so when when you were when you inherit when we have an inherited we we also have let's put it this way inheritance could be passed or future or future is that right is that right I mean the way we look we inherited that that it doesn't matter if you if you wanted your your your uh uh certain features like somebody else's you know I wanted to be taller like my brothers they're taller than me but I'm the short guy and I used to pray to be taller but I inherited this shortness right but I'm not sure to some people I have a daughter you know but she inherited that you know and I I think about um um when I was younger I looked like my mama and my mama was a good looking lady and then one day somebody said to me more like your daddy well that wasn't a compliment to me but what can I do about it like this could spin on family it was inherited now I would love that somebody say to me bro the way you look the way you going all I can do is see your daddy Jesus Hallelujah but those things are inherited messages is that right so you say well what do you mean sometimes people are wealthy and they inherit buildings and the foreign to the people that is inheriting these things for the most part it means nothing because when the person dies they sell everything to the shoes you hear what I'm saying but the P to the person who owned it down everything to them because they kept people but to the person who's who who life wasn't into that yeah I hear what I'm trying to tell you you happy you have inherited the greatest thing that you could a person could ever have and everything that comes with it what however you treat it yeah I hear what I'm saying people will sell it out things of the world always be a daughter but don't when we get to heaven [Music] and all you got is one is right store up your Treasures that's what we're doing we're storing up our Treasures in Heaven let me move on this is what I want to say I can get ready to close because I must keep I'm Gonna Keep screaming it issue until a person gets sealed with the Holy ghosts if it's nothing but two or three that comes up with it that literally comes through with it I'll be happy because I'm gonna tell you something we come in here and you know we come in here religiously you don't see what I see the joy of the Lord last night yeah but God can do the same for you like coffee cafe coffee can wake you up and so can Christ you see Christopher he can get he can give you strength yeah you know what I'm saying you know just like I told you and I'm gonna say it like this before I close I'm not sure what you're getting like this I mean this I wanted to come to see when you come in here tired I want you to know it's a spirit company because when you get out that door and the word is OverWatch all of a sudden you burst with this energy it's true y'all get out and I'm gonna watch you today to make sure but you'll go out that door let's get everybody laughing everybody got all of this energy you know while I'm preaching I got people like oh you're not saying it but you reflection thinking you know you're making me feel like I'm I'm abusing you laughs I'm trying to help she said you know and you know what bothers me I'm so glad you know I'm glad a lot of y'all can smile now because some of y'all when y'all first came here I could be preaching actually like you mad with the world y'all know I'm telling you the truth you know I'm telling you to do I'm like what did I do wrong but I'm y'all can smile and laugh now I'm ready that is a plus y'all know that's a plus so it's just the grace of God [Laughter] oh God has brought us a mighty long way but I'm gonna tell you something people apprecially okay I'm gonna let y'all see y'all got energy now because you know I told you I was going to watch it now my thing is this I wanted to look around and I want to see I want you to see your family you know what you don't know how much like brother Brown said you don't know how much you love each other if something goes wrong you live far from each other's house I mean what's wrong with inviting somebody to your house just for a cup of coffee um you understand what I'm saying I didn't invited everybody into my house and you know you're always well we I can't go to the pastor's house foreign now when you come to my house 99.9 my house is clean no no nothing enough but we do have days where we relax don't come to my house judging my house we come for Fellowship yeah I'm trying to get us to see but you said we uniting God here we're not going there to be United and they start with brotherly kindness we can't distance ourselves like everybody else it goes about church some of y'all I don't even see that often and perhaps I don't even know your name and perhaps I don't even know your name because we haven't fellowshipped enough now you know my name cause I'm your voice but it's important for me to know your name you know I don't want to say God bless you Sister Brother YouTube but I need to know you and you need to know me y'all understand what I'm saying on that level I I'm not evil I'm not the kind of Bishop Bishop that I want you to idolize me I preach on this common level um because there are no great ones Among Us I'm but because I say that doesn't mean you got a right to disrespect me you understand me that's why brother I said call me brother foreign [Music] [Music] right amen like when people come to my house I'm almost done I don't expect you to like all American food American and I tell people that is this what I was wrong my wife might fix something you don't like my family you gotta eat it I want you to enjoy yourself did y'all understand what I'm saying when you come you come to enjoy I don't particularly care about this even if you fix something put it on your plate you don't like it Go foreign but I am not offended am I making sense don't talk about me at the church am I making sense and that's true we all different we come from different parts of the world but we have one thing in common we gotta love each other how many y'all I don't I don't lie I didn't mean to do that I said I was closing but let give me one more I think how many of you all are perfect every day now I mean just in your natural cell don't you don't do it wrong you don't think wrong has been right hey don't raise your hand because if you do no no that's what makes you a hypocrite because there's not one of us every day that's why we need the blood of Jesus that's why we need forgiveness that's why we need crime and so none of us being that and also none of us at each other will be different from your fault we still have thoughts right one might lie the other one might steals we got to come to understand the grace person let's stand the woman you know I want to say salvation we got to learn how to release ourselves in Devon Paul set ourselves before we come in the door and if you if you can't set yourself Free Republic when you come here even though a corner somewhere and pray don't let the devil have you come to church steal the word away from you why are you in church he steals a word because your mind is moving every in every direction that's what the Devil comes to do that's why it's always good foreign thank you [Music] and so in closing um [Music] I have a vision and it's just right with the word you see the outpouring of the Holy Spirit denominations right now but brother Brandon said that's a true sign the foreign the most it rains on wheat and Care hello are you battling brother Brooks I'm fighting greater battles now than I ever fought my battles have so intensified it's every day I am determined because I see the enemies examine myself because I have been ordained by the Living God to take a Rapture I am I am certain of that I had a brother say well what happened [Music] deliver [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in your name Jesus Christ amen amen we maybe you've noticed we'd paint it outside and we're gonna we're gonna finish it up we're gonna do some more painting and we're going to clean up everything around here but but we're cleaning it up not to mess it up I don't know whose children [Music] wrote on the back wall with with markers and we had to go over that area several times to cover it and on the way like I said you got children you allow them to go back there and tear up [Music] children are tearing up parents will be responsible um like I said uh we're trying to make this place look better anybody that want to contribute to the cause you're more than welcome whether it be by physical labor or something that was not free um don't let your children go back there without supervisions Elizabeth that is not the children's playground we don't have deacons or anybody to help you control you must take take uh initiative to make sure you know where your child is right so we did Miss Bible study we're not going to be putting on the line we're not having Bible study noon I know I said I wasn't going to say nothing but yeah if the if it if you don't get a text saying Bible study is canceled that means you'll be having Bible studies now we're in the process of doing a few changes and I said like this is to the teachers or the instructors there is you know you're not going to be here and I'll teach the children but we need these children to be taught the word of God it's important they be taught God will hold us all those things being said just just uh [Music] allow the Holy Spirit to direct you oh um I don't know how serious you are about salvation but I'm serious at my niece's funeral um I told him I said y'all know I don't fake Christianity doesn't mean I'm perfect but I said because I'm real you hate me I and I said that's okay okay you know when I go down by my relatives they they handle me like I'm poised those questions because they've they've allowed themselves to be captured by our Antichrist spirits and when you don't listen even when you know it's the truth right because that's exactly what Cain did that's exactly I knew it was true he became an antichrist that's how it is today now we're here by the grace of God I love you all you know it's okay I made the way I'm made I don't repent from who I am God pleasure making me happy pleasure um so I wanna I wanna say this is [Music] [Music] that's what the whole essence of the message is this is because God said how can you love me um [Music]
