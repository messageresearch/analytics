in the morning and I will [Music] in the morning the city that still [Music] amen hallelujah one of those old say songs brother branham used to sing one of those rich old songs you love the Lord as we stand the Holy Spirit is very sensitive brother branham taught us that and we should know that when we don't produce the right atmosphere God is not pleased and I didn't come to see you I come to hear from God that's all I want to hear from and that is God I appreciate everybody here appreciate our musicians but I also appreciate it when I know that the Lord Jesus is in I can't preach without him I can't sing without him I can't live without him and I don't want to be without him that's just the way it goes as we stand by God's grace we ask that you turn with us too far Philippians 4 Philippians 4 you love the Lord will read the fourth chapter the fourth and the seventh verse and then will lead there and go to Ephesians three Philippians four four through seven rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus I read that again and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus Ephesians three beginning at the 14th verse of Ephesians through a chapter but this calls I bow my knee unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and in earth his name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with them his might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love that's important rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and debt and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge he might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church by G Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without in amen let us pray father we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your love and all that you are and all that you will be in our lives father we pray hallelujah that you strengthen us give us words to speak they didn't come to hear my words they come to hear you Lord we humble ourselves before you father my will but let thine be done and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated for those who may not understand the reason why we do stand when it comes to the Word of God because we really believe that Jesus Christ lives he's alive the Bible said that he and his word is one and so when we read the word in honor of him we stand in honor of him I know if the President or someone else would come in you stand when the judge you come into his courtroom they say all stand and it's just a matter of respect that we do this so that you could better understand why we do this we're not here to worship anything or anyone outside of Jesus Christ who is the Word of God this message in which we are to minister this morning something that the Lord placed on my heart you know we have been dealing with a place that God has prepared and that is the the essence of hope or faith that a Christian have that we won't remain in this condition but Jesus even according to st. John 14 says let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it wasn't so I would not have told you but I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also and wherever he is is where I want to be now I want you to understand that this salvation in which we are speaking of doesn't come by human effort even though we believe that faith will make a man work we understand that is not your works that save you your salvation comes by way of God's choosing you not you choosing god it is what we call election by God's foreknowledge God elected us is that right so you understand that I'm preaching this message my thoughts came from the word it came from the the message perfect strength perfect weakness perfect weakness perfect strength how do you want to say it and enticing spirits and I would encourage you to listen to those but I want you to understand that this word that we're speaking is an eternal word it is a word that God has delivered this is what makes us different from all the other denominations and and when I say that different because we're not a denomination we are not an organization right this church this church building the name of this church will not save you salvation only comes through Jesus Christ the Bible says there's none other name no other name given unto men well but we whereby we must be saved and that is the name of Jesus Christ at that name every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess hallelujah so I want to say this morning as Ephesians says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ we know who the father is is that right because Philip asked Jesus one-on-one occasions show us the Father and Jesus says hi Philip have our long been with you have I been with you so long you don't know who who I am he said when you see me you see the father so everything about Jesus Christ was a reflection of the invisible God Elohim himself so we realized by God's grace that this whole thing that we are now experiencing is about God's love hello you and I must know that God's love is past understanding with this natural mind we can't understand them we cannot comprehend God with this you can even understand God existence with this cause with this amen we have a beginning and we have a ending but God is eternal he has no beginning nor ending and you understand in order to understand God you must believe God by faith right and faith is something that God gives you you can't even believe in God without God giving you grace to believe in it but when that revelation comes there is nothing then can separate you from knowing who he is I like to preach this morning the love that cannot be defined something that God has given us that can't cannot be defined and people's about oh I love you but can you define love anybody seen it have you seen love but love is more real than the book that I'm holding in my hand love is something that comes from a different dimension oh if we could buy it I would work all day just to keep it just to have it because I find out that with love I could conquer everything hallelujah but because God the real love is God not the inferior love fill your love get so jealous gonna kill the man but divine love can love so much it will forgive a man and you and I must understand that God is willing to give this love that you can't you and I cannot define to us I didn't say you had to buy it I said he's willing to give it hallelujah see because without God being you you will never understand him neither will you know him he must live in you for you to even comprehend what he is all about when we think about the riches of his glory and I must say this in just a moment get to my point in womb in a moment the riches of his glory the Bible said is past finding out you know and I have been born into a world I call it the world of death the first moment you take a breath in this life you move from life to death as a child the cute baby you're dying with every breath hallelujah and to know that this world is a world of death why would you say that because everything that comes to life in this world must die and you and I must understand if that be true there must be a world somewhere where there is no death there must be a world somewhere where the people and things never die that right there's a contrast there's a light and there's a darkness mallalieu yeah and we are in this realm of contrasts of good and and of evil hello before Adam and Eve sin it was all good there was no evil it was like the world that we're going to hallelujah there was nothing that could harm or hurt Oh glory to God so we know it exists but when Adam and Eve fail they introduced us to this realm of good evil and every since then we've had to deal with good and evil whether you like it or not it's true because before Adam and Eve fell they stood upright hallelujah and a child was to be born at right like a tree it goes up right but because of the fall we must fall we have come into a fallen world and when a woman has a baby the first thing the baby do it does is drop it falls but that's not the way it's supposed to be the way it was supposed to be we were supposed to come upright and forever live upright but now we see the trees when they get old and they die they fall because of what took place in the Garden of Eden and you and I must understand that this world something had to bring a correction hallelujah something had to bring a correction to this world otherwise God word will go back void and we know that God's Word can not go back boy whatever God speaks it must come back to him just the way he had in his mind hallelujah and when he taught Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply every see every child everybody that would come out of that loin was made and created right in the mind of God even though it wasn't in existence since here it was there is that right that's the Bible God said Jeremiah I knew you before you was formed in your mother's womb hallelujah as you say the virgin shall conceive talking about Jesus himself where was he before he came here somewhere somewhere somewhere there was representation of him hallelujah and you if you are eternal and see what happened who I love this I love this so much because when I when I fell because this is a love story you can't define it you think about it before I eat fell nothing was out of place and if there was something that Adam did not like he could change it just by his words and we realized by God's grace him and everything was perfect there was you know whatever wasn't he made it so and you and I must realize Amen such a control and God told Adam he says listen I want you to subdue he ought he already knew something was coming put everything under your feet in other words I want you to be God of this earth and I want you to rule it like I would rule it bring everything under subjection this love cannot be defined but then when I look at Eve and she comes along and he identifies her and tells her who she is and where she came from the thing she loved bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh folks there was something going on there they didn't have to date to love each other it was instantaneous because he was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh he knew where she came from and he knew she came out from him but she yeah she was deceived you understand me how how is it that God always stands for you even when you fall it's deep that's what I call deep that no matter how many times you transgress his love he comes after you because that was the way it was in the time of Adam and Eve whoa my like you heard me say I could say I love you I love you I love you oh I love you but you'll never know or I will never know how much I love you until you do something contrary to what I believe you should do God so loved the world as contrary as you and I can become even as Christians God still loves us Amen it's nothing amen is that right that's what Paul said who should separate me from the love of God who shall separate me no one can separate me and who can separate the love that Adam had for his wife he didn't say what he said who showing that there was an individual what we call a serpent that tried to break that law hallelujah but it could not break the love it solidified the love somebody help me here it was at that time when Adam could oh he could say all Adam so loved Eve because in that soul there's nothing can be defined you can't define that soul because it's eternal hallelujah that's how it is with us and he lost everything he lost all of his authority he lost the power of the spoken word he lost his position as being God of the earth he lost his position in God but even though the devil could break the fellowship he could never stop the relationship because Adam was truly a son and it's just like any father and mother no matter how bad the kids get you know they're still yours that's how it is with God no matter how bad you become you still here maybe I'm the only one that's happy about this oh I've heard it so much but I'm gonna tell you something you know why you you're not excited about what I'm saying cuz you've heard it here it's not in your heart if it was in your heart it would bring you joy it would stimulate you to a place that you couldn't help but just get excited about what's being said hallelujah oh god help us Jesus I tell you what I'm trusting that we would get to heaven we're gonna have a little more excitement than this Oh help me Jesus because you and I must you gotta understand we have an interpreter so I'm trying my best to work with the interpreter so I want you to understand by God's grace that God's love is so rich and so pure and sometimes we don't even understand what God is doing but even when it came to Adam and Eve he was showing in in a short the redemption plan he showed how Adam and Eve was guilty and he showed how a bloody lamb something took their place when they had already been charged and said today that you eat of this tree you should surely God God had already taken care of it before they even step foot on earth there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world for them there's somebody that's why I don't worry about being saved and don't worry about being in the rapture and don't worry about those things why because I am see when you have met God I know preach it brother when you have met God for yourself he's not the God as I brother said yesterday the god of somebody else he's your God y'all young people who missed it yesterday it was excellent it was really wonderful oh my goodness Bernini how I hope by God's grace it out my brother Samuel would with Minister that message again it was really good now with the bed with it so I want you to understand by God's grace he meant that here God comes alone and the Bible says for God so loved the world that he how many y'all know how to quote that scripture but do we really understand it that God saved the whole world knowing that the whole world would not be saved but he saw you there and he understood he had to purchase a whole thing just to get you and me Oh hallelujah what a love how many of you have ever been really sick and the pain is racking your body and you just wanted to quit and won't quit now every woman has experienced them exactly those who have had babies I'm talking about that kind of pain it's excruciating it's one of those kind of pains you want to stop and nobody can't help it stop and you're thinking yourself the sooner this thing stop the better I'll be and while it's going on feel like I'm gonna lose my mind some of y'all sisters don't forgot that's what they say usually when you have to have the baby you forgot what kind of pain it brings but nevertheless I've experienced the pain one time and I in that pain it was so beyond my comprehension it was a level 10 and above and I wanted to get out of that pain and there was nothing that was taking me out of that position and literally it was setting my mind and I was thinking to myself I thought to myself Calvary Calvary far beyond what I'm experiencing and not one time did he desire to get out of it once she began into it one time in the garden he's a father I wouldn't this passively but nevertheless not my will but thine be done think about it giving birth to one child versus giving birth to a number that no man could number can you imagine the pain the pain was beyond human comprehension and yet he did that for you and me he did that knowing that times you and I would be ashamed of him he did that knowing at times you and I would wit would would would walk away from his word he did that for you and I knowing that we would never be faithful with to him like he's been faithful to us hallelujah a love that cannot be defined you won't find that on the human level hallelujah oh you won't find it I'll say it again on the human level but God love is not only human level it is not what you can give me it's what he can give us hallelujah God gave his life for us and you know what we forget we forget what the sacrifice was all about we forget it hallelujah but God is a God that never will forget is that right he said I'll never forget you I have engraved you in the palms of my lo a love that cannot be defined and even when you think you're going through hard times God is still in control somebody help me here even when the enemy comes in like a flood the Bible said I lift up a standard hallelujah even when the devil thinks he's got you God said you don't have me hallelujah because you got to realize you're representing God there is not a fortress there is not a wall there is not a building there is not a hell that can hold God y'all hit me and as long as you got God on the inside of you you are victorious somebody helped me here let's fly with the Eagles fly come on somebody and you must understand where the eagle is he looks down at the battles where the Eagles fly he can see the storm coming from afar somebody help me here where the Eagles fly they build their nests in a place of safety not even the Predators from Earth can go up that far hallelujah where the Eagles fly they have eyes that can look into eternity they can see the enemy y'all heard that brother preached here last week a few weeks ago he said what does the ego do to the serpent he goes down and he grabbed that serpent he takes him up where the eagles fly hallelujah and then what does he done don't do to the serpent he drops the serpent I think tonight or this morning we need to drop the serpent hallelujah we need to destroy the devil I smiled up hallelujah and understand no weapon formed against us can prosper that's the kind of love I'm talking about I'm talking about the love of God there's always in your favor when you don't even think he's working he's working demo somebody and i'ma jump to something here because I want you to understand answer probably God said in the message paradox what is the most important thing in the world he says is God's church God made the church he made it for a purpose to take a church out of it a bride and that's the most important job in the world Oh somebody help me you mean to tell me I'm important yes you mean to tell me that you are important that's God's love and God's love amen makes you important even when you don't feel important Oh Lord y'all go let me shout by myself I feel like just shouting myself well because I realized today that nothing no weapon nothing no one nothing can separate me from the love of God that's the kind of love hey somebody help me here you say what are you saying brother see this is what would you must understand this good and evil works in your favor well yes boys stop playing this good and evil works in your favor and this good and evil is for you don't let that bother you my point is how can evil work in my favor because God uses evil to purge you though the trying of your faith through the trial of your faith is more precious than gold you don't even know what you're going through what you got in you and to God let the devil comes I'm a district oh we can look at job and I'm just gonna use him for a short period of time but we look at job and God said to the devil where are you going where are you going I know you up to no good [Laughter] yes I know you're looking for some adventure let me ask you this have you considered my servant job just so you know just so you know not one trial can can knock on your door until God says is okay when it does God is expecting you to be the winner and reason why some of us go through battles is because we open the door to the delivery man but if we would shut the door or not even open the door the battle would go on because you just won by not accepting the devil's mail and you and I must understand by God's grace that when it comes to God amen and you you are always victorious is that disturbed is that the word Paul said we're more than conquerors we just not oh I just hope to make it in I don't already made it I don't know about y'all but I've already made it I'm sitting in heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus yet I'm standing here on earth whoa I feel like shouting let me get back to Jobe God didn't already seen the ending of job's battle you think God gonna brag on you with hope God is a God of faith not Hope Garden already bragged on you thousands of years he's been talking about this bride thousands of years he's talked about you and he knows you going to win he knows that no matter what kind of trouble you into you coming out he knows that something on the inside of you will never let you stay down but let me say it like this you got to go down in order to come up hallelujah see you you you you got to understand Jesus Christ Himself descended first then he ascended but he had to come down in order to go up you were there in your theophany form Oh somebody help me here is that right but you had to come here down in order to go up somebody help me here so even when you go through your trials and you're going down don't worry about that because a just man may fall seven times in the day but he's gonna get up you're going to get up something on the inside of you that will make you get up many times you have said Lord I can't take it I can't go any further God knows that's the count of mine he knows there's some representation on the inside of him that's not gonna let you do that hallelujah I don't care if you feel like you've been backslidden for years God has something on the inside of you that's not gonna let you stay because I want you to understand it ain't about you it's about him and Jobe had to go down is that right the Bible job said God says he's a man perfect he's perfect I look at him as being perfect he's perfect and maybe Joe got a little bit into himself you know I don't know but God had to let Jobe suffer so Jove himself can see where he stood oh I love God who I love God let's see how much you love him when the trials come hmm but this God love doesn't waver like ours his love is constant y'all hear what I'm saying so what did Joe what did God do his love his constant love stayed right there with Joe have you ever been there you're going through trials and you feel no anointing you don't feel that quick and enjoy you don't feel it yet you're going through it and you're thinking God where are you and we forget he says I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you so it's not like he's gone on a vacation he's just being quiet he wants to see what you're going to do yeah I ever seen that before let's say a little child when they're getting ready to walk and you see them you see them fall you let them get back up you see him fall you let them get back up and then especially when they first started standing right everybody get quiet cuz they standing you want to applaud but you don't applaud until they go down then you fall but we want them to know that they have achieved something hallelujah and you got to understand how did they learn these things that they can walk cuz they looked and watch to you living epistles written and read of all men that's how people know that Christianity is real when they can see Christianity live through you and me that all right y'all know we the fallen creature Eagles don't know Eagles don't go to school right an eagle in the animal how many of y'all can build an eagle's nest somebody tell me oh no matter how brilliant you are then therefore the eagle is more superior so they can do something you can't do see how the nonsense that is but the point I'm trying to make is there something that God put in them that's transferred through them by the DNA or like that whoo oh man about ran on that one hey something transferred in them by the DNA that that somehow this knowledge comes it's real Holly it comes god mercy if y'all could only understand what I'm saying hey see what I'm seeing it's just that DNA transfers that knowledge of how to build an S you'll never see mama eagle and daddy eagle with a pen pad or some kind of written board to instruct them it's already given in his past from generation to generation and that's what happens to the real seat of God if you get the germ of God if it quicker than you dare our knowledge of God that transpired in you you cannot even explain it oh come on somebody what about flying when that Eagle is kind of being taught to fly hallelujah guess what happens mama ego takes them up knowing they got to go down hallelujah so sometimes elevation and sometimes promotion hallelujah you don't know that promotion comes with problems huh alright come on mister truth even in marriage oh I know I got the right one it comes with problems the point is when you go up you gotta come down in order to go back up and that mother Eagle said get on board and those little Eagle is jump on the back and she'll take him up and all of a sudden the ride is no longer fun cuz she flips hallelujah and we see flips you can hear those little Eagle scream right and she doesn't go she doesn't just rush to their rescue she waits a little bit and to see what they gonna do hallelujah and if they don't get it the first time she'll drop that position and she'd get him again so you better get that the second time because you know what if you don't get it the second time there's gonna be a third right that's the way god watch he teaches house he's tried to give us understand I don't want you just walking I want you to fly like an eagle I don't want you hopping like chickens I don't want you down there with the chickens you are need a hook and I'll keep on working with you until you understand you have two wings that you can fly with somebody help me here because I want you to understand Ignis eagle is she gonna get those babies and she gonna said she gonna take him up there and do it again she's in flap it's in you catch the win it's in you you really don't have to do a lot of wack set those wings and the wind will take you up that rise all the eagle has to do is set our wings and the wind will take you up mm-hmm you gonna have your battles forget it you're not getting to heaven so easy Jesus had to suffer like he did he said if you're gonna be a Christian you must take up your cross and follow him that means you gonna suffer hallelujah you're gonna be rejected everybody ain't gonna like you hello somebody you know we look at this thing you say well what do you mean why because you must understand that this world is a world of purification where God takes those who have been defiled by sin and purifies them because all of their only the pure in heart shall see God you know what the theme of this message was only believed only believed you know what only believe means there's no room for unbelief all you can do is believe hallelujah that's all I can do is believe I don't have to understand everything but I believe everything and as long as I believe everything he will work everything hallelujah come on somebody we don't have to feel when we know God is our Father fear is torment fear is torment and is of the devil you don't have to carry that strap and drop it let him be destroyed today you don't have to fear a little you're nobody no no perfect love casteth out fear anyway you'll believe that how many y'all love this world but all of the pain and the sorrow in the sickness and everything that goes with it you love this oh I came Holly wait to go I can hardly wait to leave this I cannot Holly await for God to come and change me and take me to a new world sound like science fiction right I don't care what it sound like it's real it's real you say how real is it just as real as my mother's belly was real and I was in that world for nine months hallelujah do you remember no I don't but but I believe it's show because I'm here and since I've been here I know that everybody that comes here comes that way hey you don't come here by no flying saucer nobody teleported you here you came by your mother's womb and if you had to be born here in order to get into that other world you must be born that's what Jesus said he said to Nicodemus that which is born of the flesh is flesh but you must be born again and that's once to get over into that land you must be born of the Spirit that must be our Holy Ghost in your life in order for you to go there because the Bible tells me you're caught in the book of Revelation even nothing that will defile that shitty will enter therein hallelujah I hope I'm not screaming so much but the point is I think a lot of times people forget you're gonna die your momma call me your mama can hold your hand but if your time for you to die ain't none she can do about it this is what gets me doctors think they're gods but know what none of them can preserve life hmm they do that you know they could come to you and they act like they're in charge they charge and what they using is of God science God created it and people believing that more than they do believe in God why not believe in the man who created it oh come on somebody let's move on listen what we need is fire you know love is fire fire is love in the perverted sense is called fire huh did you all know that oh I'll come on the scripture says it's better for a man to marry than to burn that's perverted love in the fire for and it was real love it's real fire oh come on somebody yes so what do you mean every time God does something it is produced by love hello let me say it like this when God got in the fire was shot that rat Meshach and Abednego it was nothing they did it was because God loved them God loved him and God came down and stepped in the fire that woman caught in adultery it was nothing she did it because God lotta love conquers everything when God went down to the tomb of Lazarus wasn't that Mary Martha did what nothing Lazarus did but I tell you what happened those who saw Jesus saw him weep and they said wow he truly loved that man you want to see God victoriously in your life you let the love of God radiate through you and it will change even death grip somebody help me here that's why we're losing battles because we do not have I love and we're trying to fit you with human love you can't God you need God's love to conquer Satan in this day oh my because you care mouthing Mary cared but they didn't they weren't packing what Jesus was packing y'all love it I know y'all getting tired so many people just doze enough and all that kind of stuff sleepy people of God have mercy we appreciate you those who fights some a mean fight go give them a fan give them a pill of somebody you know I must realize by God's grace amen that when God is a paradox right you can't explain it but it's real hallelujah you can't love God if you don't love correction God is a God of correction he's a God of correction and people when you start correcting people they get mad and look at you they stare at you to give you the high and I'm scared I'm not afraid we worked with human flesh I'm not afraid why you don't see him but I know he's here and I know that when I pray for people because when they get attitudes I think about that brother that fell dead that just caught the attitude against the Prophet I'm not a prophet but I'm standing instead your attitude toward me can get you in trouble especially if I'm preaching what God says humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God somebody help me because you got a writ you said old brothers I don't believe I've got to go down first yes even some time when God says it's okay to come is that right Peter said Lord if that be you bid me come he started walking on the water he may have been in another dimension I don't know but the Bible said Peter walked and in just a moment time he began to sink because he started looking around at everybody what they're doing all these safer they don't pray they don't dress right why should I huh and all of a sudden he started sinking and the only way he could have gotten out of that situation is that he had to say save me Lord right there in the reach of Jesus and he started sinking that's how it is with our blessings sometimes God got it right there in your reach and at that moment you start doubting God and guess what you don't sink and the only thing they're gonna get you out of that situation is when you say lord save me and mean it from your heart I'm almost done I know I've gone along this morning but nevertheless I want you to understand when it comes to promises so that you don't think that God is just beating up on you I want you to understand that when God promised you something there's a price to pay oh I'm right you gonna suffer when God told Joseph by way of vision do y'all have a vision do y'all have a vision if you don't you lost the bible said without a vision the people perish without it if you don't see where you're going you're lost if there is no sense of direction you're lost on this journey like that you heard me say you know if I'm traveling and I might be a place and I don't know where I'm at I don't know where I want to go but I never know where I'm going with a map until I find out where I am on the map once I find out where I am on the map I could then plot my course to where I'm going that's my preaching is all about preaching is trying to give you a place on the map where you know where you are in Christ so that you'll know which way to go help me Jesus I'm almost done so I want you to understand amen even though God had given Joseph a vision Joseph had to suffer to get there he had to go through betrayal oh I tell you what oh not my best friend no your brother there the one betrayed you and guess what before you be crowned by God you got to forgive him hello before God crowns you you got to forgive those who have betrayed you somebody help me here this is serious was it with Jesus to Jesus even when they were he was and his last breath he says Father forgive them for they know not what they do he had to forgive those who betrayed him and they were of his own household I'm just storing those things out at you if I said be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God come when you are troubled when you are full of anxiety when Satan is flat put you in such a state of mind you need to talk to God he's a peace Giver hallelujah he's a chain breaker Inu uses singing that song if you don't believe it he's the chain breaker and when you talk to Jesus who is the Prince of Peace hallelujah he'll give you a peace that surpasses all understanding I don't know why I'm not upset anymore the storm is still raging but you know what the difference is I'm in the cleft of the rock hallelujah I'm in the shouting praise where I can watch the storm and still have my peace which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus don't tell me he's not the remedy to your problem he's the solution to every problem every problem but you know what it will not work for you if you don't believe it you said I don't know how to let go I used to think it like this come up into that Pentecostal room thinking I had to fast so many days mmm I thought maybe if I scream and howl or nothing whoo hallelujah I could shout it out and all I realized all these years all I had to do was this let it go let it go is of no value anyway let go you should with God I want the Holy Ghost I don't know how to let these things go yes you do you just let it go you just drop it don't care about where it lands drop the thing in other words stop is that right you say brother Brooks and I'm not crazy maybe I am but I remember South South African brother who was telling me a story about this man who stole his buggy they called him those are those are we call him my SUVs stole his buggy and the man was running and he said stop in the name of Jesus [Laughter] and the man stopped hallelujah see that's the spoken word you got it that authority is yours you tell the devil stop I'm not riding you anymore I'm not caring all with you no more I'm not I'm done and watch God work for you he's got to see that word come out of your mouth first you got to speak out and I'm gonna tell you something you can't easily lie even if it doesn't connect you keep speaking it right extra extra read all about it I'm healed even if your faith is not active at that point in time if you keep speaking once that word is activated by faith it's finished my last little quota from paradox why would we be afraid to take that word to ourselves and apply it to ourselves what is the problem we can have faith for everybody else but when it comes to us our selves we find it so difficult to apply it no you're not worthy no you never will be worthy he makes you worthy his your worthiness comes by his grace oh I don't live right nobody did with Jesus the Bible said all come short of the glory of God only one man was perfect and that's Jesus Christ and he said he became our sin that we might become his righteousness let's Stan you can't define his love and I'm gonna tell you something I'm not gonna call I'm not gonna come short I'm not I'm not I refused to allow this world to make me live like an underprivileged child I refuse it you know if I watched everybody else and everybody else's behavior you know how I probably wouldn't even be here but you know what I've had an experience for myself I know God for myself maybe I'm not where I should be but I do know I'm not where I used to be and it ain't no matter if I'm living I'm living all the signs of life is in me and all the signs of life should be in you let me tell you something I learn about nature nature expresses itself according to the order in which it has been created in other words you'll never see a Apple transforming itself into an orange every see to bring forth this kind and that's what we've been preaching that's what Malachi 4 was all about to give us a word that was unadulterated that we can produce the kind of seed that he was carrying and that seed was the seed of God a word without his own thoughts and without his own desires and you and I must understand if that seed is in us and it is Quicken you don't have to worry about that baby forming itself hallelujah is that right all you do is you God use use using and in the way of a conception but when God comes into you and that conception is made that child will grow as long as you handle it in a healthy way feeding it drinking when you ought to drink doing the proper things it grows because it's life outside of your life and that's how it is with true believers oh I don't know I just I just got to stop I gotta quit okay well if you get God you ain't got to quit it will quit you oh Lord do you know right under well I should have been you know I took that last drink yesterday and I think I'm gonna take another one today you don't have to quit drinking if you get enough god it will quit you is that right come on sisters y'all those of us who don't have babies and everything else you know you probably before you got pregnant you love cheeseburgers but if you get a baby and he don't like cheeseburgers you're gonna have trouble [Music] is that the true that burp that baby go like whoa are they working hallelujah but what if that baby like pickles with with with with peanut butter and you know that don't even sound good guess what before you know it you lose a Papago give me some pickles and peanut butter why because that baby is calling for something it means you may not need it but the baby knows in order to grow healthy there's something that peanut butter and something in that pill co that's gonna make me physically healthy hallelujah that's how the Holy Ghost is in you we'll do that we think that would defile everything that will make it sick it's gonna kick it right on out you get to the place you stop cause it's go quit and like James says if you pray enough and believe God can take away the desire then you won't have a temptation you don't have temptation unless there's a desire in you and if that's a bad desire that's what we call demons it is what it is but God's love for you he died for you even knowing how many times you were gonna fall he knew every bad thought he was gonna have it doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is there to mature in you the Holy Ghost is there to grow you up so that you can be without those little baby things all right I don't want you to say I think I'm saying you ain't got it you can have it in you growing trying to bring you to maturity but you gotta allow him to do it just let go I want you to think about the world what is this world to you nothing what has it done to your other than bring the pain and sorrow disappointments at times you think oh god I'm gonna lose my mind why because of this world now there's another world Jesus came to open that portal port or for you I am the way the truth and the life he says I am that door I'm the only way of entrance if any man comin the only man gonna go to that place he must come back that's just the way it go but you know what you must realize you've been born sinless you belong to you but you've been you've been here in a place that you can't help yourself and only Jesus Christ came I know that my mother was a Christian I love the way she lived and I used to try to live her way and every time I look around I was falling on my face I didn't know nothing about no Holy Ghost and then when I found out about the Holy Ghost that scared because you know how people in out those day they felt like you had the jerk and all that kind of stuff that to say you got it and so it was scaring me you ain't got a jerk hallelujah and that's what we've done we made the holy ghost sensations and that's what we get sensations and I've been guilty of myself you know you can beat on this on the pulpit all night long until you surrender and you don't have to beat on this pulpit to surrender you can surrender right there where you're standing it's surrendering God I surrender I don't know how to surrender but I surrender is that right the Prophet God said is like trying to put y'all would put those babies you know they're trying to get him dressed you couldn't that sleeve one on and and you're trying to work that one harmony they coming your way and you're like trying to get it the other way and they going this way and but finally they they stop resisting you and and keep stealing in you could put that sweater or that jacket on then that baby gets so happy cuz they've learned something they've learned to yield to your direction and that's what God is trying to get us to do yield to his direction and not our you love the Lord [Music] hallelujah God is so good to us in moment I'll sing the song I'll sing [Music] I lived on my hands too [Music] [Music] see [Music] in the body desire prayer you may come [Music] [Music]
