to open with the word of prayer we asked to pray for um brother isaac sierra's father was called george he's suffered a small stroke and um there's a sister who's um bleeding on the brain that is his ant i believe so let's just keep them in prayer so that god can heal them so that god can stretch for his hand and touch them [Music] and um we asked to pray for the poor family amen so that god can be with them then sister ruby told me she has a testimony the some time end of last year she went to the doctor and they told her that she had bacteria in her stomach but then she heard good news that that's no longer the case amen so we should thank god for that when we bring our prayer requests not just to pray but we know we pray to him pray answering god and he can answer our prayers amen let us bow our heads and open with the word of prayer dear gracious heavenly father with our hearts full of thanksgiving [Music] because that's what you created [Music] we have come lord in your house to

oh god as you have done for the others may you hear them oh god but when you will all god will come back unto you with thanksgiving in our hearts and say thank you for what you have done and also because we pray for his ant who's ahead of leading in the brain but we know you don't know disease or god there's no disease that's too small or too great for you you heal everything the same old god

about home time i can see my father standing at the door this world is by the wilderness and i'm ready for deliverance lord i've never been this home seek before you see the bright light shine it's just about home time i can see my father's standing at the door this wall is about a wielding ass i'm ready for deliverance [Applause] [Music] the table spread and splendor someone standing by the open door i can't see the crystal river lord i must be near forever lord i've never [Music] my father standing at the door this world is [Music] lord [Music] i can see the family gathered all the sweet faces familiar no one's sold a fever anymore and though this lonesome heart is crying i'll think i'll spray my wings for flying [Music] yes i can see my father's standing at the door this world is by the wilderness and i'm ready for i've deliverance been this warm sick before [Music] never been this warm sick i've before been this home sick before amen we can take our seeds for a little while this is the divine she has especially [Music] well it's not hard to believe standing on the mountaintops of glory [Music] when you can hear the songs of angels and the breeze from heaven send your spirit sorry but in the valley once more would jesus still belong that's the question [Music] isn't easy that is the testing [Music] for the time when the sun does not shine and the mountaintop is just a memory when there's no sky to be seen and i don't feel a thing to the word of god [Music] when troubles come my way and i just don't understand what it means when nothing else will do faith alone will see me through and believing becomes my victory [Music] well it's not hard to believe when things are going well and skies are sunny [Music] oh when you feel you're making progress doing good living in a time of plenty [Music] by the thought that should change would you still keep the faith that's the question [Music] cause believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing [Music] when the sun does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory when there's no sky to be seen and i don't feel a thing to the word of god [Music] [Music] and i just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do if alone will see me through and believing becomes my victory for the god on the mountain is the god in the valley when things go wrong [Music] you'll make them right and the god of the good times is [Music] got in the night [Music] amen the god of the day is so god in the night so we ought to praise him when the sun rises during the day we ought to praise him the bible says let everything that has breath praise the lord it doesn't matter whether you are happy or sad you just gotta praise him amen let us stand up on our feet and sing this song praise him praise him praising him in the morning praise him [Music] oh let's praise him now break him oh praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the noon time praise him [Music] praise him when

rainy amen we gotta praise him anyhow hallelujah as the pastor gets ready to come for let us sing this song the old time power they were in an upper chamber amen if we submit ourselves under the same circumstances we know the power can fall on us amen [Music] when the holy ghost descended as was promised by halloween [Music] fire came down [Music] singing [Music] just now [Music] just now [Music]

amen always want him a service is not a service until jesus shows up thank god for his grace and his mercy and thank god for each and every one of you truly god is good to us in spite of it all we must always praise him because he's worthy to be praised and we thank god for those of you who have come out tonight it's a few it's cold out there i thought several times to cancel it but i thought that wouldn't be right i was out to the grocery store today so if i can go to the grocery store i can truly come to church god is good to us and um i don't know what i'd do without him i know that he is the center of my life and i guess he should be the center of everybody's life we had such wonderful services this saturday and sunday i was really blessed with the birthday celebration the gifts and everything that everybody did give us and we thank god for that in jesus name as we stand we'll just go right into the word of god we're going to ask that you turn with us to deuteronomy 29. we're going to read the 29th verse of the 29th chapter it is one of those things i think we should always be aware of when it comes to god please deuteronomy 29 29 thank you brother and it reads the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law second passage of scripture will be from psalms 18 and 11. psalms 18 and 11. he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves today you gave us a lovely day we understand that it is cold outside but there are those who weather is far worse than ours and so you said lord in all things give thanks and we want to give thanks father we've had special prayers that went up for different families and father the song about trials and tests it was so sufficient it was needful because all of us need sunshine and all of us need strength in the times of adversities and i pray father god tonight that you would bless those who are in dire need of your touch and your healing touch we ask these things that you would give them to them according to your grace and mercy in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we thank the lord we just uh want to minister a message tonight uh on the secret of god or the god the great secret and as i thought about the great secret i couldn't help but to think that the great secret is god himself because so many people don't know him and the world at large have an image in their minds on who he is and what he is some people have made him some kind of an image of creeping things and crawling things and you name it and the reason why they do that is because they have no respect for the bible the bible in itself is the word of god it is the suppressed image of god in word form and many of the questions that the scientists and the theologians are asking and wondering about if they had only if they would only have confidence in this uh they would then begin to perhaps see a glimpse of who god is science and mathematics and all of these kinds of things that people use to figure out problems will never come to a conclusion or never be able to be solved when it comes to god because you can't figure him out that's right and the only way that you can understand god it has to come by revelation he must reveal himself to you there are things that we know that the lord will not share with us about himself until we reach that place called heaven however he imparts himself there uh will be a great thing and we we all want to get there to see it but here on earth we know him as a savior we know him as a redeemer we know him as a counselor we know him as a protector we know him as a defense even as david said he's a strong tower and amen he goes on to say he's my battle axe so we know he even god even in welfare but many people you know think that what we believe is foolishness only because he's not tangible he's not something you can see or something you can touch with the natural realm because god is spirit that's right we know by god's grace that a secret is something that is not not not seen nor and not known uh and it's something that uh no others will know unless you tell the secret but when we say i've got a secret that means you as an individual holds that secret whether it be a secret uh i would say a treasure place in your heart and god holds many secrets the thing i love about god is that when he calls you he doesn't tell you everything at one time and oftentimes we go through trials and temptations and tribulations only to find out that in the darkness that's where we'll find it the bible tells us amen that even darkness to god is light and even on our dreadful times are at times where things are so hard or seems unbearable he's always there because he said he'll never leave you nor will he forsake you amen and you must understand that god always hides himself in simplicity so therefore if you're looking for god in such a high way you'll never see him they always take a condensation a condescending excuse me of oneself to in order to see him otherwise you won't be able to see him many times we we have have read in the word of god where god was working and doing things and and he uh there were times he was in the wind there were times he was in the whirlwind there were times you know he was in a lot of places and a lot of things and then he comes to place to he says um i'm in that small still voice how often do we fail to know that that's god speaking because a lot of times we often want to hear a thunder or see a lightning flash and you know we we we try him we test him and and that's okay god wants to be known but we find out that in when it comes to salvation god has a perfect plan he has a way of us knowing who he is he's ordained what we call a prophet and according to amos three and seven he says surely the lord will do nothing but he reveals his secrets unto his servant the prophet so we know by god's grace uh that god uses men he always used men uh to unveil himself but many times oftentimes we want to see the great wonders of god you know you know fire or wind or some kind of thing to you know excite our natural being but that's not what god has come to do he comes to redeem us i think the greatest secret of all times is that the purpose for for calvary and the purpose for jesus christ dying i think that's the greatest secret of all time because a lot of times people think that god comes just to save you but understand most people don't even know what they're being saved from and we say okay well i'm saved from sin but what is sin but unbelief and every time we find ourselves in a state of disbelief we find ourselves in a state of sin we think that lying cheating stealing whatever the case may be is sin but those are just attributes of sin it proves that you don't believe what is it there in the word of god that god wants us to believe we didn't know these things and had it not been for profit in our day we would not know them now but we had no idea of our beginning nor did we have any idea of our ending you know that's why science is so confused today uh thinking that we you know i guess they say evolve from monkeys and you know we're evoluting in some type of great something and i look at today and look at what hollywood has become and and the world at large has become and i'm saying if that's evolution may god stop me where i'm at because i don't want to be i don't want to evolve into that kind of perversion that kind of thing wherein that you are so confused you don't know whether you are a man or beast but god has given us a word and he has told us amen and shown us amen some great things that most people don't know just the very fact that we came from god and that we go back to him and when we say that we are sons and daughters of god it makes us more than just mere men we become amateur gods amateur messiahs we become omnipotent as he is because not that we have power of ourselves but because the omnipotent dwells in us we must know by god's grace that god doesn't give his secrets to everyone you must be a special class of people and the reason why i'm saying these things because even though we know these things because of the message we have allowed ourselves become dolatory we have allowed ourselves to become complacent we have allowed ourselves you know uh the word to be common and listen this word that we have in this day has has come to do a mighty thing uh with us and that is to change us from glory to glory it ought to be our vision every day to look for changes that god has made within us it ought to be in our vision to remain connected to him and to hear his voice on a daily basis not when you just come to church but it's something it's a fellowship it's a communion that god wants with us that's why calvary was made so that god can bring back the fellowship that he once had with us before the foundation of the world i mean can you imagine what it must have been like when adam and eve before they failed the glorious time they had in eden uh words the english words but perhaps could not even express what it was like and you know it's kind of like what we envision of heaven uh to be like no pain no sickness no sorrow no rainstorm no lightning nothing of that nature nothing that will do harm or danger nothing that's dangerous rather amen and that would do harm to us but it was like a peace and a love that literally as paul says passes all understanding amen jesus said in luke 10 21 he said in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight and guess what when god brought us into christianity he did not tell us about all of the things we were going to have to suffer he did not tell us about the valleys that our sister was talking about because oftentimes we've been preached to or believe in our minds or somehow in our minds imagine that to be a christian would be able we'd be able to live on the mountaintop would be such a super race that we'll never have the valley experiences but in reality in order to have a mountaintop experience you've got to have the valleys now the beautiful thing that i love about the word of god is that he never tells you what it's going to be like in your journey he never tells you about the hardships because see if we understood or would understand the things that we we would be confronted with maybe we wouldn't come but he calls us by his grace and his mercy and he gives us the holy ghost a power that will withstand all demon power when we think about it i think about moses moses was having a wonderful life in egypt he wasn't suffering i don't think moses was malnutrition i don't think moses had any natural afflictions because he was really the next to be in line but moses was a secret to egypt and god was a secret to moses and so god kept those things until that appointed time and let me tell you each and every one of us here tonight maybe you're not conscious of who you really are but you have an appointed time with god where god is going to reveal to you exactly who you are in your relationship to him amen but even when that is done it doesn't mean that the road is going to be easy we're traveling a hard road a road of suffering amen because through this suffering as i said the other day it brings us into a place of pure gold but the gold must be beaten amen think about it god can't just give you authority and power amen and a place of rulership when he knows you don't know how to handle it or even what to do with it of course we've seen that through the pentecostal age people who had gifts of discernment or whatever it may be just speak things out and destroy people's lives even though they were true they didn't even know what to do with the gifts and god needs maturity he needs somebody who knows what to do and let me tell you something about this kind of authority must be ruled by love amen divine love if it's less than that it will fall and fail it would cause harm to people that's why god what he does he does well so he called moses and moses is trained on the pharaoh he he's a scientist and he know all the mathematics of of everything he probably was number one in his class i don't know but the point is when god called him he didn't say moses come but he put a desire in moses he put a yearning in moses and once moses realized that those slaves out there was not only slaves but they were brothers they were sisters and when he realized amen that those were his people and those people had a god he understood that the people out there were brothers and sisters and their god was his god amen it made him thirst and when he saw that egyptian kill his brother moses in return killed the egyptian guess what god didn't tell him god never showed him what his future was to be here was a man driven by something on the inside because the word of god said he had chose to suffer with the children of with his family or his the people of of israel than to be called the pharaoh's daughter so moses chose to be a and jew he chose to be a jew he was exiled can you imagine where is this god and what we do not know that little part of the story where he left egypt and traveled through the desert we have no idea what he suffered just like when you go through your desert experience nobody knows what you're suffering but understand by god's grace god keeps it a secret why because faith must move you trust must move you you understand me trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding the bible says if you acknowledge him in all of your ways he shall direct your path now moses did not have a map amen but he was being led by the holy spirit and did not even know it you hear what i'm saying oftentimes we're being led by god and don't even know it why because god has an appointment with you he has a place that he's placing you a position he's positioning you in and he's going to take you to that place but remember moses was on the back side of the desert for 40 years and what was god doing beating all the nonsense out of it all that science and all that education and all that i know and i know and i know and all whatever pride he had god had to beat it out of him and god called calls him to marry guess what a sheep heard his daughter that was the lowest of all laws to be a sheepherder in egypt was lower than being a garbage man today now they make pretty much pretty good money nowadays but back in my day you know what i'm saying people used to pick at them but my point is i'm trying to tell you before god can exalt you he must humble you and he hides himself in darkness no doubt when god talked to lucifer or the devil about job job had no idea what was coming his way think about how difficult it was for job when he knew that his life had been righteous before god and then all of these things befalls him and his best friends are calling him a sinner questioning him questioning his his create christianity let me say it like this people are not going to always talk well of you satan will purposely put thoughts and evil thoughts in their minds against you and cause them to persecute you and what you're going to do about it like you say praise and praise them in the morning see what you must understand is that whatever comes your way all things work together for the good god didn't say he was going to explain everything to you amen amen god is not going to explain everything to you because what but he's looking at you and says i want you to trust me i want you to believe in me i want you most of all to love me see what we fail to see is this little thing with listen we call ourselves a bride so what god is doing testing your love for him is that right for sickness in health for richer for poor for better for worse and when he brings the worst we can hardly take it right but that's that's that's the kind of if you love him you stay with him hallelujah is that right you think peter james and john and the rest of those disciples when they were offered a a a time to leave when jesus said will you all go to they responded lord where is we gonna go you have the words to eternal life now you better unders why am i preaching these things because darkness is coming what we're going through now is just child's play you must understand there's a rough time coming and you've got to have the goods in order to pass through it yeah i'm not trying to make you worry but i do want to make sure you get the holy ghost because the holy ghost is going to be the only thing that will gain ground of the oncoming storm surely god will do nothing that's what brother adam said he tells us it's coming hallelujah but at the same time he reveals himself now every one of us can testify we've had a miracle of some sort of supernatural thing happen in our life i mean things that we cannot even explain and we know we weren't worthy of them but yet god did them anyway amen those are the things that you glean from you know in the hard and difficult times when the devil comes to you and says hey he ain't real he don't love you now i know i'm preaching a simple message but i'm preaching it because i want you to understand god did not even spare the prophet god allowed him to get in trouble you think god said oh i didn't know you was going to reject those pentecostal people no he knew it he also knew the flood was coming amen hallelujah but why did he allow him to do these things because he had in his mind something else that was going to be greater but god needed obedience that's right he needed obedience from the prophet and let me tell you something that's what happens in our lives when we fail to be obedient god will allow things to come in our lives to make us obedient and what are those chastisements god we're chasing us if he loves you and the bible said he's chasing those whom he loved listen let me move on according to the exposition of seven church ages brother brahman said you will recall that i mentioned that at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work is in the future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we'll fail to get it hello bring these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means the book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one without prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instructions not just a student comparing verses with verses though that is good but a mystery required the teaching of the spirit or you'll never become clear and what are you saying how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know because many many thousands of people read this bible many people read and study the message books and they intellectually get it that's not it you really need the holy ghost you need the power of god moving in your life bringing you from glory to glory to glory from virtue to virtue to virtue because this is the secret the secret is the reproduction of god amen that's what it's all about when god made adam in his image and likeness it was the shadow and the type of what god's real intentions were and this first adam failed him but the second adam who was a quickening spirit he had an offspring he had a seed and we are they amen and you got to recognize who you are in order to go forward you must understand god has secrets he's not going to tell you everything and when he brings things upon you he expects you to be obedient and most of all he expects you to love him even more when you come through a trial that's how it is with little children when they don't have such a mind to reason and to think you can spank them and they'll run right to you instead of running away from oftentimes we've gotten so grown when god spanked us we want to run from him and accept satan's idea that he's evil and god is not evil satan is evil the rest i said earlier the main reason purpose you are here is to become the sons or daughters of god knowing this you should make every believer to press in other words knowing this you should as a believer you should press press press press because oftentimes we can get what's that word let's just say you get relaxed you get relaxed and now we don't have time the time is not even on your side it's running out and yet people can't see the time is running out that's why paul said press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus you understand what i'm saying you ought to stop thinking like men we got our focus in the wrong place now it is all it is insane let me say it like this it's an insane thing to make you think that as a christian you're going to have jesus on your mind all the time and i'll explain that to you because you got to live you got to go get groceries you got to work but he said this this is how he says it whatsoever you do in word and or indeed do it all in the name of jesus christ y'all understand what that is because when you're on on and you're doing a math question a math of math or any kind of equation in school jesus is not on your mind you understand me the math is on your mind but in order to include him you have to ask jesus to give you understanding of the math acknowledge him and he will direct your path see but a lot of times we think that oh my he's going to be so and we're just going to be like angels like oh i don't know how that is but i long to be yielded to god where you know he's constantly on my mind first peter 1 7 says that the trials of your faith and and the reason why i keep saying this because the reason why i brought it because god secrets are your trials not all of his secrets but some of his secrets are your trials he never tells you right right oh come on folks that's it's the truth and i want to say to those who are not married yet a lot of times people when they get married oh my goodness you see the you hear the birds singing and you know you you just and everything and you know butterflies flying and he's yours and you're here but there are going to be bumps in the road everything ain't going to be oh how does it hunker dory you won't know what that word means but anyway everything is not gonna be lovely oh y'all yes uh why do you think people say well you know people need to be counseled before they get married because you need to understand that marriage goes through seasons when you need to be prepared and the only thing that makes you prepared for that seasonal changes is lobe that the trials of your faith being much more precious than gold that of gold that perishes the gold of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction don't you just love it you know why i'm preaching this because i'm so tired of the message people we believe we we we just hear all these goody good things and we fail to see you've got to suffer to get that amen it would have been wonderful if jesus didn't have to go to calvary but he had to go to calvary he had to be beaten he had to be scourged he had to be mocked he had to be sped upon and guess what god did not tell him everything about the journey brother branham said he went to calgary as a man he knew it was going to be rough because in the garden he says father i would that you this cup passed from me but nevertheless not my will thine be done and that's how the bride prayed not my will but dying be done see every step of the way he went up got gotham as if when he got to the top and they nailed him to the cross jesus had never felt pain like that before you think the beatings were bad but when they pierced his hair and pierced his feet i can't imagine it and hook he hung between heaven and earth on that cross i know i know but you see every time i think about my sufferings i think about here and mine can never compare to what he suffered from me that's why i love him so much because through all that torture all that torture he stayed with the plan of god he never looked to the right nor did he look to the left the bible said he set his face like a flint and that's what we must do when the squeeze comes when the pressure comes and it's still it's moving people that's the thing that gets me maybe i'm losing my mind but i know what i'm looking at and we've got to be prepared we must be prepared and the only preparation god gave us was to have the holy ghost you got to know that you know you got it i keep telling people if it's not the holy ghost ain't doing a good job now what he's going to do when the real thing come help us jesus he said but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is rich it is complacent see that's the word i was looking for it is complacent it has made of affluence the major criterion of spirituality the evidence of god's blessings and the correctness of doctrine and etc is now based upon how many rich folks are involved in it yeah jesus didn't have none you had better come before it too late said the lord and by me gold tried in the fire amen and then you will be truly rich let me say it like this this is what i love about it god has given us illustration after illustration i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you and when you think about gold truck when i think about gold tried in the fire i think about those hebrew boys they did not know did you know that when they went down to babylon god told them you got to go and if you don't go you'll be killed he forced the issue why because god wanted to manifest himself in babylon sometimes god puts you in positions and you don't even know why you're there but the reason why god puts you in awkward position is so that you can shine the light of god to these unbelievers it's the truth think about it think about this these secrets that god unfolds and then we come to a place and then we begin to see it's like a job you come to work and you don't understand that they you don't even know that they've actually added more work to your schedule but you knew and you know god gave you the job you understand me you don't get upset there's a reason for it god want to see what you're going to do under pressure and that's who you are under pressure you know what i'm saying and when we see ourselves exploding like a volcano we need to get before god and say god have mercy on me take this evil out of my heart see because god knows your tester is evil but he's trying to get that evil out of your heart that's what he's doing he wants examples he you say bride god god got plenty of church members there a lot of church folks out there god working with pride he's making folks into his image and into his likeness the same the same the same and whatever jesus did under pressure is what we're supposed to do under pressure he said you better come before it's too late said the lord and by me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less nothing more so when so we had better be real careful how to see that we take something that we make us right before god so then what will we we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of a character will you take with you will it be his his whole character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace affliction or will it be the softness of this character-less character-less laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden the lord requires it don't be afraid of the fire no more than the three hebrew boys were they said if he deliver us or if he does not deliver us we will not bow and that's the thing we're not going to vow you understand me now i'm kind of moving to the future of things because what we're going through now is not that not the pressure that's coming but the pressure that will come the prophet god said they will turn against you they will turn against us and we will be persecuted we will run we'll try to run y'all understand me it's not going to be pleasant and none of us will escape right oh well you say well praise god you know that's that was my attitude i'm under the blood i can't get corona huh that's how we think sometimes i got enough faith it ain't going to happen but if it's ordained it's going to happen we never knew that jesus christ got sick at times except the prophet told us he had afflictions there were times he had headaches he had to get away from the crowd he went to go find peace as a man he had those things but he had it he had so much god he never did sin amen he wasn't like job cursed the day that i was born he didn't get no he wasn't there and sometimes we get there amen don't you ever wonder you just trust that by god's grace i'm right and i'm gonna make it because sometimes when you if you ever wonder you think where would i appear you understand me my point is we know too much we've heard the word we know too much i'm not fussing please don't take it that way i'm just trying to explain and trying to get you to see that the fire is required when you when you answer the call there in in in revelation the third chapter he said come you know buy of me gold tried in the fire the fire is required to refine you to refine me or test his tests and god is going to test you in the in the ways that he knows it's going to hurt the most hello he said what do you mean jesus where did you get those scars what is the wound in the house of my friend watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man watching therefore and pray always that right now you got two things that we more than likely don't do we don't watch and we don't pray and those are the two things that god put together that you may be accounted worthy to escape god tries his children he always will and he always has from the time of the uh of the garden of eden you know what it's amazing because it looked like god didn't know what he was doing but he did he tried those who were standing perfect yeah and he put the serpent there and that's why i always say i said somehow adam in that short period of time gained a greater love for for for eve than he had for for god god's sadness has always been the same if you love me keep my commandments that's right he also had a law you know that you leave mother and father you know cleave to your wife so you know in all of that adam moved out knowing that he was wrong doing what he was doing even though eve was deceived probably god said god tries his children now listen to the message i'm not going to be long folks i know this is a wednesday night most of you tired and all of that but i wanted to bring this to you in the sense that you know we just had a glorious time i did but you understand that when god gives you a glorious time the devil is coming amen he's always there to try to take away what god has given you he's been appointed to do so that's right and you must understand that when you have a great time in charge is not a time to walk out those doors relaxed you better arm yourself with what god has given you because the storm is coming now listen to the message noah on the 17th day of february according to the word of the of god entered that ark and the next morning all of them was around expecting to see the rain start falling but the sun come up just exactly like it always did just a couple more hours and it start and it'll start the rain will start the day passed and i imagine noah her heart began to flutter i could say something uh right there but i better not but you you notice he couldn't get out if he wanted to he was sealed inside that let that sound it sound but what are you saying he was sealed he couldn't get out of the troubles out of the stone he was sealed in the stone and you know we've heard songs about when the storm you know lord the storm we've been in the storm too long what kind of stuff is that whatever the storm is we need to find out what it is that god is trying to get to get us to reflect amen hallelujah even as a man a woman tell a lie on you you need to start rejoicing that you've been counted worthy that god will allow that kind of a lie to be told on you look at peter james and john when they were thrown into the prison and his old always being you know that kind of thing you know why me lord no they rejoiced they were glad times and disappointments are going to come folks no they're not pleasant but at the same time it should never make you doubt your love for god amen and your trust for him i could just recall when my mom died at a young age just going to high school i didn't have nowhere to stay i had to go from one house to a neck to the next until eventually somebody in the family allowed me to stay as a young boy i could have gotten angry at god like some some people do that don't have no better sense than that but i can look back and say hey that worked for my good because as long as my mom was there i could i would have never seen god is when god removed my idol i was able to see him all things work and those things that seem like it's just it's so crushing to you praise god in it because god is not trying to kill you he's trying to bring life god is a god of life look at ruth and naomi and all of them what naomi had to go through in moab god never told uh them before they left when you go to moab you're going to have such a hardship no they went to moab because moab was flourishing they thought they had a good life for a while but the times turn and god didn't tell him when you go down there i got a young lady by the name of ruth that i want you to bring with you no he never told the secret because he was hiding those things even from the devil himself here well ruth is now saved through this whole situation and out of her comes jesus that line that's right you see what i'm saying so why didn't god the devil he he tried you know he i know he tried to kill you at some point in time but he couldn't do it why because your purpose is today what god wants to do with you it's still unfolding but you need to look to see what it is he wants you to do other than to be dilatory no no no no no there's a word there's a purpose for you being here and it's not to be just church members your pride you are free and god want to see you free so free that you can hear his voice and do what he's telling you to do even when it doesn't make sense he goes on to say how many days it was and then the second day passed the third day passed the fourth day fifth day six until a complete week pass and north set and sweated it out then what lesson do we get from that if god see god what if miss shakarian would have said when the holy spirit spoke thus said the lord there's a white mist going from her the cataract will leave and it never left for about two or three weeks but she kept sitting there saying it's got to be so it's got to be so y'all understand that it's like when healing comes and and you know god then gave you the victory you got to speak it amen you got to speak it's like that lady who had that big guard on her and and the other lady was dying from cancer and then her husband and their people was making fun and brotherhood say one day the angel of the lord came through the city you can't force his hand you just gotta wait till your change comes that's what god is trying to and that comes with trust i married a girl i didn't know but i wasn't worried about not knowing her god knew her y'all know what i'm saying i never dated my wife i got a word from the lord she was my wife i got up and i proposed to her three months later we were married we've never talked divorced you understand what i'm saying why because god i had a connection and god we connected god told me and i've never regretted married my wife what what i'm trying to say is it's real it's real can you say oh but that's not bible yes it is isaac never never met rebecca until that day and he didn't question her either immediately he took her and they went into the tent it's supernatural that you won't you want god to work in every aspect of your life especially when it comes to marriage somebody say hallelujah glory to god it's the truth it's the truth but you know what we can't dictate to him we can't tell him what to do we've got to wait on him he's lord he's shepherd sheep never leaves the shepherd leaves the sheep hallelujah is that right when i had that little stroke and everything or whatever that was and my foot my left foot didn't want to obey my mind i walked and i ran saying in the name of jesus i'm healed now i'm healed amen it's the way it works when god gives you something you hold on to it that's building your faith that's preparing you for a rapture that's working on your translation trust because it's coming whether you see it's coming and how can you believe you're going to be translated if you can't believe on these natural little things that you ask god for and you need to wait on how many people had to wait longer than you abraham how many years he had to wait sarah how many years they had to wait for a son years i think it was 75 or so we can't even wait a day that is a while but you still have to wait huh hey look look look let me say it like this you you say well well what what look about look at jacob 14 years and jacob was so in love he said it was like being there day i'm like that's powerful that's powerful you understand me but that's how it is with god once you're in love with god your trials don't seem so long when you really fascinated about him and like you understand what i'm saying there's a brother there's a brother and i'm talking about bride i'm talking about marriage i'm talking about all of the things that we talk about when it comes to making a rapture this is what it's all about your bride then you ought to be fascinated fascinated about your bride or your husband rather right i remember a young man i mean he was so oh i had never seen it before in my life and he and his girlfriend was in the in the restaurant and he was like i mean it was like he was spelled out everybody we were driving through we were driving through the to the drive-through and we looked in the window and we saw the way he was breaking and all of us couldn't do nothing but laugh but that's the way it's supposed to learn you know the ark was made out of tomorrow and if you ever know what that was it lights her it's lighter than blossom it's nothing it's just like a sponge so light you could pick up a great big beam of it and hold it in one hand and would and wouldn't it seem strange that god would construct his art out of such a thing as that pour it and poured it into it to fill it up the pores and then he becomes harder than steel that's the way we have to do is empty out every creed everything that is in us every nonsense every ungodly unbelief that the holy spirit might feel us and seal every pore of our of of of of our uh excuse me of your neighbor excuse me and feel every poor believing every pore of our minds until you you won't notice whether it's your neighbor or who is setting around you you're sealed into the kingdom of god and then you can stand the buffet of the waves as you go through a persecution i'm giving instructions tonight i'm telling some secrets because we don't know what tomorrow is going to bring we don't know we have no idea what's up the road but whatever it is the will of the lord be done whatever it is it's yes lord hello whatever it is it's still i thank you lord i i'm closing in just a minute hallelujah for you're a gene of your father you were in your father yet your father had no fellowship with you because see you was there you were in there but you knew it not and he knew it not but you was manifested that you might that he might fellowship with you and you being born again you're born of eternal life and that's the only one form of eternal life and that's god's life zoe the greek word is zoe only one form of eternal life amen then if you are a son of god this is my last quote or daughter of god you were in god all the time we've heard this many times but he knew that bed in the end time that you'll be planted so now you made a you made a creature a son of god manifest the son of god daughter of god to meet the challenges of this hour y'all hear me if you're a son and a daughter of god you have been made and put in this age at this present time to meet the challenges of this hour to vindicate the truth and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time so you got to understand it's not we didn't come here to be educated we come to be born we come to live we come to be the expression of jesus christ himself and understand with to come to the rapture go listen to christ revealing his own words i think that's 1964. you listen to that and see where you and i supposed to be going the goal that god has has established for us to achieve listen to it and you'll see that be prior to the rapture before he comes and literally comes you and i must be so much like him brother i'm saying we will be jesus christ in feminine form that's more than words that's a life that most of us have not yet obtained a place where we are pressing into but you've got to press i'm just going to cut it off we got to press into it we've got to understand it's going to we're going to have hardships things are going to get bad what about the early church what about them people who saw their moms their dads their brothers and sisters burned at the stake and yet they could not allow a speck of evil or hatred to enter their hearts they had to be so illuminated so uh into a place of god that when they were being burned or praised to the state they were actually feeling sorry for those who were persecuted you say that's not scripture yes it is because even stephen says father don't hold these things to their children he was feeling sorry for them that's the kind of love that's the kind of power that's the kind of god that must live in us in this day otherwise we're going to find ourselves fighting like peter before he was converted the secrets the secret is like what jesus said to peter peter love me more than these see you've got to love god more than you love yourself and only that comes through prayer it comes to prayer only prayer you can hear the word all day without prayer it's not going to work let's stay in god don't have to explain nothing to us remember the time that that little boy a little girl whichever it was died the brother adam told god you owe me an explanation said that to god god departed for him for about a month brother branham said when the lord returned to him fellowship he gave him that's what we do when we don't get our way we power we think that god told us something no we oh god and the saddest thing is we could never repay him for what he's done for us we know by god's grace now [Music] my life is still a secret i don't know what tomorrow brings but i know who brings tomorrow whatever comes my way i will trust him i'm going to hold fast to that which i know is real and true everything around me is some kind of illusion a nightmare or some kind of dream but i know god is real and sometimes god tries you in a place where it hurts the most i can tell you what even when it comes to my own children satan knew he couldn't get me to turn around so he jumped there what you think [Music] there's a place in my heart i'll never betray him he always will be my lord my savior and my king i started out i was determined if i had to go by myself [Music] and that's basically the way you ought to think because it is an individual race it is an individual walk it must be determined to meet jesus because i think to myself you're going to meet him whether you're on the right side or the left side you're going to meet him but you want to meet him on the right side i hate commit suicide kill yourself whatever you do you still got to meet him and i know how the devil said you won't you know want you to get out of things and i he's you know he's annoying me with those kind of thoughts too you know but thank god he didn't allow it to happen if he had not intervened it would have happened but he intervened i'm so glad he did it made me know he has a purpose you love the lord let's have a word of prayer [Music] heavenly father we come before you lord you know how i struggled all day [Music] yesterday the day before looking for this day and what you would have me to speak all right thank you for speaking to my heart to the hearts of the people tonight [Music] seeing that you're the greatest mystery ever or the greatest secret but yet you choose to reveal yourself [Music] folks like me you're such a wonder i thank you for the times that you enlighten me in times when my situations were so dark [Music] couldn't see a way out of it yet you came to my rescue so many times times [Music] father you've

image i thank you for your promise because you promised me and you promised us that once the work was started so we thank you father god for your promises yes [Music] thank you for the service tonight bless your people lord i trust that [Music] day [Music] [Music] so [Music] all through it all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus and i've learned to trust in god through it all [Music] upon
