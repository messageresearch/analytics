TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on the man that could that could literally what save her rid her over demons that's what's proud with us we've got some no praise demons yes sir come to church and you don't want to praise God that's a demon say what you want to say that demon gonna make give you every reason why he don't want you to shout and show joy and show love see if you don't praise him if you don't get into his atmosphere you can't love nobody you can't love nobody not even yourself Hallelujah and I'm not going to be here long but this is just a portion of the message I've been trying to bring us you know we've been giving everybody credit you know huh well Paul says listen everything I ever had I counted done but in this age we said oh Paul was such a great man that's not the way Paul felt about himself Hallelujah and a real Christian we don't feel prideful we don't think we're so much better than somebody else hallelujah we're in such a state of Thanksgiving humility clothed you know with same faceness in that sense uh I wonder how you would have taken John if you lived in his day John and a little like a maniac half dressed leather clothes skin wooly hair but I've never seen a comb never knew what a toothbrush was standing out there popping locals in his mouth like popcorn or peanuts you would have thought the man was crazy and every time he opened his mouth he was criticizing your church [Laughter] and people in the message well we're so this we're so that you we we Way Beyond that no you're not that's the truth that's that's the deception that people think that they're far beyond Pentecost and never been to Pentecost but I wonder how far you are from the left or to the right right because you've never been you don't even know the joys of the Lord without the Holy Ghost you don't know what the joy of the Lord is oh Anybody Can Dance anybody can shout the music and make you do that ask a little baby oh you ain't got to have nothing but emotions for that you beat the right beat that baby gonna move sometimes you got to say huh baby no no no that's the wrong move wrong move y'all know it's true so that that has nothing to do with the Holy Spirit that's just emotions but when it comes to having the lamb listen they had to not only kill the lamb they had the Rosa lamb and they had to eat the lamb and the Bible said they had to eat it in haste you say brother when the last time you you read a message or listened to a message oh well I can't tell you see see this is this is something's wrong with this anointing uh these people have on them and they claim to be bride something's wrong Hallelujah brother Branham didn't claim to be Malachi 4 he was and he proved it by the anointing right it was it was absolutely the anointing of that hour that distinguished him from everybody else I heard somebody say today oh I believe he's a false prophet I said um shame but she was ordained for that you was ordained to believe he's a false prophet I was ordained to believe that he is the real one a true one right am I ashamed of him absolutely not Hallelujah because the word in which God used and brought through him is the reason why I stand today I would be nothing without this message that's the truth Hallelujah have mercy have mercy have mercy listen and I'm moving on Behold the Lamb so I'm gonna show you something the denominations of people they think they're under the blood they don't even know who the lamb is they think they because when you think the lamb is is a trinity a second person in the Trinity it makes me know you don't know what you're talking about brother I'm already in trouble because I believe what I believe Hallelujah and the only one in this day that was able to point out the lamb Was Elijah amen right look at Paul John's day you had Pharisees Sadducees they were calling him the devil like they're doing now Hallelujah but John the Baptist let me read this thing the next day John seeth Jesus Saint John 1 29-34 coming unto him and he said Behold the Lamb of God which taketh the way the sins of the world you know what that word means behold don't miss this preaching don't miss this I'm pointing you to the man who's greater than I am the man who I wasn't even the worthy to lose the latches of his shoes I'm trying to tell you this man is my savior amen amen a man becomes a lamb you know that's something else because a man it's a fallen man there's no way you can become a lamb until you have a nature change but he was born the lamb born in a manger Hallelujah [Music] lamb whom I said John said after me cometh a man which he preferred before me but he was before me hello now if this judges said that what about our Elijah Elijah says there's one coming after me and who is that that but Jesus Christ himself it was Jesus Christ who John pointed to and guess what even John's disciples did not recognize what Jesus what John was pointing to many of them still follow John but then there were two that packed their bags and said Jesus cannot follow you oh yeah I'm one of them I'll follow the Lamb of God [Music] Hallelujah is that right brother random preached on it talks about the lamb how that lamb must continue to keep that Lamb's nature hey is that right you got to keep that lamb nature you can't be switching from a lamb to a wolf Hallelujah he said the Holy Ghost leaves you goes off on a branch and waits till you confess and make right before it can come down in a bowl with you again Hallelujah abide with me we say Lord because the Bible said if you abide in him in his word abide in you Hallelujah you can ask whatsoever you will John Bell record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dog and it Abode upon him love and here God did the same thing in this day and people feel saying it's a fake oh so many people got a lot to be to answer for and I'm glad I'm not I trust that I'm not one of them this lamb and I like I said it's not going to be long because you got to understand when the lamb took the book that was powerful hey hey you tell my God in morphing he unveiled himself the whole time that lamb represented him but now this lamb is a man Made In His Image and likeness the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him they thought because he was humble he was weak they thought because he didn't fight back he was a loser they didn't understand the lamb had orders according to the scripture he couldn't open his mouth he had to go to his shears dumb he had to go before them amen without defending himself like the port said he could have called Ten Thousand Angels they said the Angels amen was all in the trees all he had to do was move one finger and they would have tore it up but he knew there was a there was a greater uh uh I could say he had a vision in his mind there was someone that he was dying for and that someone was you Hallelujah and you gotta understand amen he paid the price for you Hallelujah is that right that means if he paid my price he paid your price we are free you don't have to have to worry about hell he went to hell for you the devil had us all day worried about our salvation if you're in Christ you can't be on in Christ it can be not not in Christ if you in Christ Christ is in you Hallelujah is that right Hallelujah I love this saying in in the Book of Revelation amen it says uh uh and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prepared to open the book and to loose the seals there are see that's a revelation to me a powerful Revelation because the Bible previous to to that said John found there was no one no one he couldn't find no one and he was sad about now John knew he wasn't worthy Hallelujah now John laid up in Jesus's bosom and all of that but he knew he wasn't Worthy right he knew it wasn't Worthy any Christian if you're really a Christian you know the only way in your soul you know the only way you'll make Heaven is by the grace of God Hallelujah is that right and the Bible said Jesus Christ was full of grace and truth the devil don't want you to know the truth he don't want you to know that you're free indeed he don't want you to know that you don't have to worry about it because if you are in Christ it's already been settled you've been Justified as though you've never sinned in the first place Hallelujah I know I'm sitting everywhere that's okay it's good to me anyway some things don't need to be said that's for sure but you know about the grace of God we we look at uh how God put it all in the book all in there and John says Lord the elders Still the Lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book see you know and you know brother Brandon talks about it the difference between the book of life and the book the Lamb's Book of Life and the Book of Life amen is when you were born this world this whole thing that you you you you had to travel through that's the Book of Life all of your Deeds are in that book but when you come to Christ and God transfer your name from the just the book of life into the Lamb's Book of Life you see the lamb is the savior the lamb was the king of Israel Hallelujah glory to God why not an eagle he was an eagle but you've never seen a sacrificial eagle it had to be the nature that God chose the lamb doesn't it make you want to be a lamb don't you want to be identified oh I'm a lion I'm an eagle but nobody want to be a lamb but in order to make Heaven you got to have the Lambs of nature which is Christ himself and he came and took the book out oh don't be talking about me and hey I ain't letting nobody walk all over me well Jesus did it that nature calls him to hush his mouth you don't have to always say something back we all have trouble with that don't we but I'm learning like that song say God ain't through with me yet he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be is that right he's still working on all of us but one thing I do know I got him he's on the inside and everything that's happening in me is Christ in me moving me from glory to glory to glory Hallelujah and one day he's going to be completely finished with this product those Elders fell down and this is what I'm talking about how on Earth you can be really happy about you know I've got a I've got a young man that's not oh I won't say young boy he's younger than me uh but anyhow fired up from God and don't even know nothing about this message hmm but whatever fire he's got he has he's not ashamed wherever I whenever I see him and wherever I see him he's talking about the Lord and I mean loud and sometimes he's telling you about Jesus and you can't even get a word in I like conversations like that but you can't get people around this message to talk about Jesus long enough glory to God I shouldn't be talking about y'all like that um y'all forgive me you know I'm not talking about y'all but you know what I'm what I'm trying to say people of God we need more of him more of him and you know what I I it's true I need to start get uh encouraging you most of all I think sometimes not uh willfully or not willfully knowing a talk down which I don't mean to uh because I need his grace too and I don't want any of you to think I'm preaching like I'm better than somebody else in here because I'm not and it takes the same blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse me every day and so when I say things and you know just don't take it so personally most of the time I'm trying to get somebody's attention maybe somebody on the line or something like that because it is later than what we think coming can I can I say this and I'm not going to be too much longer but pre-adventure we live to see the persecution you know the bride won't go through that kind of a persecution but we're going to feel the pressure and God is going to bring us to a place where we have to make a decision now we will see the day I believe from my understanding where you won't be able to buy nor sale and it looks like that time is approaching just like our brother say you know there's a word that we have that we must amen understand we must believe his report and you must know the worth of your salvation y'all understand me what would a man gain if he gains the whole world and loses soul if you read the fox this book of martyr you'll find out there were some Christians that really recanted right at the end when they were just about finished they didn't want to they didn't want to go to the fire but then there was a witness somebody on who hadn't even declared to be a Christian saw them repent and basically said you fool you would trade a few moments of this life for eternal life and that person who said that stood up and says I'm a Christian and he took the flames y'all understand what I'm saying you got to know what Calvary is worth if you don't know the depths of the mysteries of God you need to know how you were saved who brought salvation to you and who that is living in you you understand what I'm saying and nothing in this world should ever stop you from worshiping the lamb Hallelujah that's what churches have done they've stopped the people because it's the church that saves them now oh I go to this church always Bishop so and so always Elder so and so oh it's not it's not Isaiah Brooks it's Jesus Christ always will be Jesus Christ I'm just an instrument being used by God I can't save nobody and the word I preach is not my own I'm just resounding what has already been preached it's Jesus Christ the Lamb of God don't care about how many people in your church people said we got a big church we got over so and so on so and so and so well I want you to know some Catholic Church got more than that huh my wife would tell you we used to travel down in Ohio am assed Mass and you'll find a parking lot full A.M try that here try it anywhere that's not been 40 years ago but you see when you really believe in something it shows say what you want to say but when you really believe in something it shows I'm almost done the Bible says in Revelation 13 and 8 I'm gonna close on this because I want you to understand that people said well this ain't deep enough yes it is yes it is you'll be surprised at the number of people that don't know nothing about Calvary and what Christ was all about and why it had to be a lamb and you know um those kind of things we're so interested in in conduct and Order okay lamb this is the way you supposed to act follow the one two three four you've never seen a sheep teaching a lamb how to act that lamb knows how to act why it was born a lamb and when your your laws become the things that rules you and make you act the way you act that ain't it they're going to be so many people that did everything just right but never was born again you say that in Scripture it is scripture the Rich Young Ruler did everything right and he still was lost he was just religiously perfect just like Paul religiously perfect and Paul to be humbled so that he could see he was a sinner and Paul said I have the Revelation now I was more wretched than any and I'm gonna tell you something there's nothing worse than a religious spirit because it deceives the hearts of the people you've got to be born again and I don't care brother Adam said it like this I think in the East is here every on our future home whichever it is he said every birth is missing y'all want these old Methodist salvation and Baptist salvation and Catholic salvation and whatever they're more out there but when it comes to the real Pentecostal salvation you don't have time for it okay One Day You're Gonna wish you had time for it and that's what the devil does he keep us so busy so busy we don't even know that we you know people don't love prayer no more I get frustrated now when I can't Pray when I want to God help me I'm almost done give me just Revelations 12. let me let me finish this 13 one first please 13-8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb huh didn't say the book of life it said The Book of Life of the Lamb why the lamb must give you life he's the one that chooses you he's the one that gives you the Holy Ghost he's the one that gives you his life he's the one that gives you his nature slain from the founders of the world even those who are left behind because they fail to go all the way and how much we we're screaming I'm telling you people there is something pulling me there is something pushing me how they want to say it every day do I falter every day yes but I could feel the pool for a higher plane I know something's moving in my soul I know something has connected with me I'm not wondering about it I know that and I know I'm on a journey and I'm willing I told the Lord no matter what it takes what I must go through I don't care about the suffering part as long as I know you with me I don't care about the fire as long as you're in the fire with me I just need to know that you're there that's all I need don't ever leave me don't ever forsake me see listen even those who were left behind they overcame now I know when it comes uh uh uh uh to Revelation 12 you know everybody said well this is the bride because I've used it so many times but I want you to read that scripture all the way and find out who those were who overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death who were those people we use that as the bride but the bride is already gone she leaves in the third chapter and you got to realize amen we sing that song which is okay but our testimony is already sure we're not being we're not going to be purged we're we're being purged now we're being cleansed now we don't have to go through the listen how it talks about it where the Jews are going through that tribulation and so it's a foolish virgin going them back to Calvary people today think we don't need Calvary I need Calvary I need the cross I always will need the cross you said what do you mean because brother Branham saw the bride marching to the tune Onward Christian Soldier marching as to all with the cross of Jesus going on before my cross the cross right his cross and they overcame by the blood of the Lamb uh by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death huh that's foolish but they overcame how did they overcome they were sanctified they had enough God in them to bring him through the tribulation and to know who God was see we we fail to see that you can be so Sanctified and do everything right but you got to have the Holy Spirit you got to go all the way to perfection in this day like brother man said the Pentecost today that message will not work it won't work it's not that it wasn't good for them but you got to go on to Perfection Paul said it brother random said it the Bible says it we got to move on and how how it's going to happen this is a new message that comes to change up into the image and likeness of God this is the age that has a revelation of God's divine nature Hallelujah this is the this is the age that we're living in where God will take a people and perfect him and translate them right change them from one dimension to another like he did Enoch this is the day and it's all because God made a way of Escape through the blood of the Lamb less than II Peter 3 14-15 says wherefore beloved seeing that you love that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless an account that the long-suffering of Our Lord is salvation thank God even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him have written unto you Hallelujah one more scripture First Peter 1 18 and 19. for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by what traditions from your father but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot that's the only way we'll ever be free is that we we are accepted into beloved thank you accepted by him foreign and we know about God's grace in this day that the bride becomes everything he is [Music] and I so thank God for that I thank God for his goodness let's just have a word of Prayer while our song Lead is preparing to come father God we thank you right now for grace
