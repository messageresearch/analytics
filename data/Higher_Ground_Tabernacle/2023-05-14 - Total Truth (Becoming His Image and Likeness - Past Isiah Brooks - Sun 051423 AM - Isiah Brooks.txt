I give it all to thee did every day [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] God is good we appreciate him a service is not a service without the Holy Spirit I appreciate the song service center and those of you who were here too enjoy and to Worship the Lord we appreciate everything you do as some may say I'm on the emotional side and I'm glad to be that way I I love it when the Holy Spirit touches me I love it when I feel his presence I love it when I can express him as brother Brandon said that is that kind of Glory probably and if you are in service and you can't feel himself and he wants to uh make you aware that not only is everywhere there's no escape from his presence and I don't care what you go through foreign as a service this morning the word this morning will reach of your hearts I believe with all my heart the message that I'm going to preaching otherwise I wouldn't be here I tried to bring a message something that I know that God wants you to know many of us amen it's like we forget God prepares the table amen and sometimes we set among at the table so we pushes certain things if he has set the table that means you expect for you to eat and of course he doesn't force the issue at the end of the day we all will realize that God did all that he promised you know we uh appreciate all the mothers America is celebrating Mother's Day really Mother's Day is every day almost 24 hours a day and we appreciate every mother my wife raising eight children four I I appreciate her and you know by my way of appreciating her is not by words only but but Deeds things that we do to make her know that someone loved amen appreciate it yeah amen so you know because even in marriage sometimes the enemy comes and he tries to affect attack us with whether we love each other or Not by God's grace that our love is Beyond skin deep Skin Deep so Genesis 26 and 27.7 trust you don't mind me taking this jacket off and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth is [Music] so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him as male and female created he them is let us pray our dear heavenly father we once again approach your holy Throne we thank you for your goodness we thank you for the grace that you have bestowed upon us Lord you have given us the opportunity to be here and we are most grateful for what you have done for us Lord we pray that your uh uh yo yo you would have preeminence in the service I trust that you would give us Grace to move completely out of your way oh my God that the people will know that they have heard from you in your name Jesus Christ amen you may be seated my subject is becoming His Image and likeness I have a subtopic which is entitled um we are at a time what we call Harvest there's a time where all the seeds that have been planted has come to a mature state so much uh whatever they are whatever they were as seeds now for example for example if you showing if they're wheat and if there's tear is at the Harvest time that you can distinguish the difference between the two while they're growing but there's one thing about the wheat that we can do something at the Harvest of the wheat the wheat bows is a proud Critter he doesn't know how to bow we have what we call the table set us is that before us is that what uh Psalm says 23. this is set the table before us in the presence of my enemies I love that because often time we think the trials that we go through we think sometimes but God does not know or understand we failed to see that God is the one who set the table the Bride of Jesus Christ has come to be tried if you've come to be tested Hallelujah and according to the word of John we are children of the day children we are not children of the darkness Hallelujah so I hope by God's grace and bring you as an individual to a conclusion hey man it is so easy it's a democracy to misplace Jesus so much so Mary then and Joseph Joseph misplaced him and when they come to find out he wasn't with them they panicked and went everywhere looking for Jesus but when they returned to the place they left him that's when they found him like brother Branham said that's what's happened denominations that's what happened to organizations I fear that that's what has happened to many of us in the message we're looking for Jesus where is Jesus and I'll tell you where he's at he's right there where you left him and in order to find him you got to go back where back to the place where you left him now the message of the hour has come to put us back in order is that right as we have been working about order the whole thing is taken out of order is that right when Adam and Eve and you know one thing about this chaos sometimes well feels like it's Everlasting I don't know whether Adam could see this day because I'll say it like this there has never been a day like this day uh so much Soul Brother call this age the evil age and he said the God of this evil since I don't remember that means everybody and they are worshiping the devil Diablo everybody except the bride except we must put God in his proper place the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the head of the church that means he is the head of the wife hello somebody that means we are we must be subjects and Jesus Christ is the word hallelujah see there won't be another church y'all hear what I'm saying so let me say it like this to you if you miss this day you miss the Rapture y'all hear what I'm saying now the Jews get a second go around Belgium [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] when Mrs Lyons we're in the millennium Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about people with such a Doctrine let me tell you take you somewhere South America I mean Africa I mean where all the wild beasts are now and let's see how much your Millennium Doctrine yeah Hallelujah is that all right is it right we are at the end times I'm trying to get people to see what's the security that means we are at Harvest time it is a time of reaping what the early churches Church ages have done what they did was great it was good yeah but that's not where we are Hallelujah and the script it tells us that they cannot be completed there's something that God has in store for us that frustrates frustrates the issue is that everybody is waiting on God push them through a hole and God is not going to push you know God is a Shepherd y'all hear what I'm saying that you need to go find to follow read between the lines as they say we're at a final time for the for the for the Salvation of the Gentiles my prophet and your Prophet is already given us a vision what the bride should be she is not the people well she's the word she is but she's not dead she is not dead she is alive Hallelujah and if she is alive Everything Everything Jesus is in her name Hallelujah we will not talk about looking behind well God did this for me yesterday Hallelujah so many years ago God did this for me Hallelujah he's all right now what has God done for you it's a good job people who [Music] looking at our brother Roofing and his lovely wife she went through a trial but you know God God healed her the doctors may have had their part with it like they say stand up and testify oh Lord have mercy somebody y'all don't even know what I'm talking about right Hallelujah talk about popcorn Praises you know you get it quickly right you don't take five ten minutes everybody got a praise boom that's it now you know what a popcorn praise is hallelujah but that's the way it used to be I think I'm sexy God was their excitement y'all better hear what I'm saying it wasn't politics it wasn't football games basketball games it was none of that football today was Jesus Christ amen hey the way we do things now we've had read the message just like politics just like the Pentecostal church is dead they brought in all the activities to appease the children and the young people you know the early church they prayed they fast they sought the face of God oh yeah and some of y'all don't even know what a fast isn't even ask you to raise your hands [Music] we're living in the age of deception that if it was possible do you understand what that means the only reason why we're not deceived God ordained it in Souls it's not by your power it's not by your mind by his holy spirit because the rain falls on the Justice the anointing by the same Authority I better hear what I'm saying the anointing of two different scenes that is being anointed by the same Authority Hallelujah he said what do you mean [Music] anointing that bring it to maturity and the same message that is calling the World Council of churches together the politics because it's been prophesied because the word says hallelujah let me say it like this everything is moving by the power of God hallelujah yes sir everything do it may seems like somebody's out of control he is in control Hallelujah foreign y'all hear what I'm saying Hallelujah comes after the battles is that right the Bible says comes in the morning oh Lord some of y'all man let me go on this preach because I look at some of y'all faces change my preaching Amen brother random said like this there is there's only one defense we had that conservative and that is the word and the Word was made fresh which is Christ Jesus he is the only defense being in him we are safe see that's what Israel had to find out that it was in Christ that was their safety zone Hallelujah is that right when Jesus prophesied is coming to Jerusalem up Titus General coming to Jerusalem in 19 uh I mean 87. 87. Hallelujah who did Escape happy the ones who was in Christ y'all better hear what I'm saying maybe but there's some thought that the priest could save him please save them Hallelujah but history had already told us that those walls would be torn down Hallelujah if he said it you see that that's exactly the way it's going to be and nothing can stop it hallelujah hallelujah but those Christians Mercy Christians understood what Jesus was telling them when you see the armies about you Hallelujah flee the city Hallelujah Don't Look Back Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying but now we don't have a mountain to run to there's only one mountain only one here [Applause] is a strong tower and the righteous run in illusions Putin foreign [Applause] a vessel of Honor cannot be seen as a vessel of honor the contrast to of who you are Hallelujah you got to see the world somebody in order to understand light you gotta understand what darkness is those people they hate Christianity they were placed there they hate Christianity Hallelujah because brother Berlin there's coming a squeeze hello somebody so you must understand the table has been set before you decide your enemies Hallelujah yet in a time of trouble he shall hide me hallelujah how am I I'm not worried about the conditions of the world is about my condition and that's where your your concerns what kind of conditions am I walking in Hallelujah [Music] if there is no Supernatural why because the Bible says what's going to be peace sign shall follow them hallelujah hallelujah I just want you to understand those of us who are carnal in mind your purpose for which God brought you here you're fighting against God and you don't even know you loving pleasure more than loving God that's what the Bible said we would be doing in this age Hallelujah you said what do you mean if I could have a house party tonight I have more noise in my house oh That's How we'll carry on waving our hands wow the anointing of a party what's wrong with us in this building right now see and we'll sit still Hallelujah not even sin and I don't know about you but this I know belongs to me you said brother books why are you preaching so hard I don't say you don't have to believe this but I feel led to say it measurement song I won't tell you what it is you know I've only had two dreams of William Branham where he comes and he talks to me about them and just the other day I was laying on my bed and I had a dream did something for me for more it was what I needed it's a subscription yes sir amen and all fear is gone Italy it will manifest itself Hallelujah I'm just saying but God is so good not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer he that's born of God does not commit sin cannot sin it's not even imputed what David said blessed is a man God will not impute sin I just went to a wedding the other day and I'm not a matter of fact I'm I'm pretty much praising them because we've got on into that word in the atmosphere trying to get everybody into it is that right thank you I feel like I feel like that this morning shame on us that we could even come to church what a bad Spirit on us when God has done so much like you've seen me say if I held this piece of paper up in front of you and I ask you what do you see now you're going to say I see words well what about all of the other space it's more space than there is words see that's what we do God it's a good we see the little dots in our life the dark places in our lives forget about all the good stuff he's done for us vacation all the blessings and all that but we'll see this trial trials and we'll see this trial and then we'll judge God shame on you the Bible says in all things um I want to see your Praises stock market crash cause it will it's going to happen I don't know about you I don't have no goals people know Hallelujah you're going to take the Mark if you don't have Jesus that's where you got to go back Hallelujah is that right brother message he said why David said this is listen this is the key when you're in Christ when you're in Christ and see this is where we we have been taught me hybrid the message in so many places like the Baptist Doctrine if you believe God is the prophet you got it you got it you can understand all Mysteries and then some of y'all are going to teach our wives they don't need to know the scripture oh my God I never want to rest on you huh Aviation got arrest on the way you are no no no no no you ain't perfect you can't even save yourself brethren we need Jesus you need to look up that word and well and all those things that he needs to do you say well brother what are you saying I'm saying there's a lot of people women who have child children they're not even safe don't know Jesus so that means do that means that they're saved because they have a lot of babies balance it out whoever told you that Jesus understood that one um Hallelujah is that right come on somebody I don't set it like this Mary Mary had to go to Pentecost yes the one who carried carries us Pentecostal experience weaving this message you know every time you get in the spirit you have a good time you get these old critics that means they ain't got it man Hallelujah that's almost like a dog looking at a dog it said oh dog Hallelujah yeah you're a dog too you understand what I'm saying and we we failed to see amen the message was all about me I don't know what I'm talking about because I know this is what he gave me hallelujah how do you know come over yourself discrepancy in this message itself that's why we don't see the Miracles we don't see the the Supernatural is that right because the Bible says it is you're better than me not at all we all need Jesus foreign [Laughter] let me cut your wrist and cut that other tribe rich person from another tribe and let's see what color it bleeds will never reach Unity United thinking like that Hallelujah Hallelujah and that is Hallelujah hey we got to get away from all that craziness Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah yes sir that's righteous to praise the Lord Praise Him praise him praise him Praise Him Nation yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah leave her alone never enjoy Jesus that's what it's all about right there God hallelujah amen sure Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah yes sir we need more of that we need more of that let him have his way Hallelujah let him have his way Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah go away go away Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah amen yes Lord see without Christ in your lives you will become an idolater it is a it's it is in a man to worship something you see it that's what he said now you see what we we do we we try to put a time element on God wait guys hey you don't know that that that's like you know we talk about the L about Alabaster Box you don't know my story you know what I mean and you can indoctrinate it all you want to well you know what I'm saying how do you know what's Antichrist and what's not come on Hallelujah and you know what amen the word of God says he said the true spirit of God willing Jesus Christ has come in the flesh yes sir amen amen glory to God let me go to Romans I'm feeling real good I mean I feel real good I thank you I needed that if you didn't I needed something amen Hallelujah Romans 1. 23-26. Hallelujah because if you're not see you've heard me say this earlier maybe a month you are changing into something hey you you're changing into something you're not remaining the same just like you did not you you didn't remain a baby once you were born a woman or a man so is it in the spirit into something Judas was a baby Judas was a young man Judas followed Jesus was born a devil into the position oh y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but there's only two seas and you've got to determine who you are Hallelujah yeah I don't know about you but no devil is going to tell me I'm a devil [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying hey man I can't believe I'm a devil no Glory you love the Lord listen what the scripture says when the scripture was written to the Romans culture but the church is the self was separated from the Roman's culture men in other words they were born again Christians the Paul was trying to tell them when the fire goes down Hallelujah when it gets warm you know germs can live in the warm conditions not in hot conditions creeping things comes in the night when the light is going out that's what happened to a lot of churches creeping things comes into the church when somebody call you a creeper that's not a compliment um don't be more and changed in the third verse and change the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like to corruptable man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things [Music] you see how these people want to be dogs I got a video right now somebody sent me to come on for you with a Japanese man we're all about his way to make a dog suit because then you got people who think they're cats where we could see him in the natural it's working in the spirit we're working in the spiritual because you're going to change into something the bride of Christ being the Bride of the devil oh yeah yeah well for God has given them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts their own bodies between themselves he said oh let's talk no no no no no that's talking to the church address [Music] now we're here called The Bride please but every seed is not right hello and whatever happened in Egypt also happened in the wilderness y'all hear what I'm saying you think you're getting your way and this is what what I realized is people don't know how to say I'm sorry if you don't confess your sins still dead where you were you left Jesus amen amen huh and you're gonna find out that the condition your condition is going to get worse I thought if God felt that that far away from you with unconfessed sins the bridge gets greater the gaps get greater you know what's going to happen you're gonna not feel him at all and then you're going to be questioning am I safe it's been a long time and you gotta make it right if I TR if I make it right then what let me tell you something Adam had to make it right I don't develop he tried to cover his nakedness with his religion and it didn't work well you say it didn't work because God asked Adam where are thou would you Adam had on the Fig Leaf I don't have it and Adam you never said I'm hiding behind the tree he said I am naked that is the Holy Spirit that's it and I'm telling you none of us want to become the enemy of God hallelujah let me ask you there's a tornado frighten you yes God is greater his wrath is stronger there's a hurricane frighten you yeah God is great it is more powerful hallelujah what about an earthquake who want to be an earthquake who wants to be in an earthquake God's Wrath is worse Hallelujah people will run into the Rocks face God in his anger oh see I can already tell seriously some of y'all are missing I'm losing something but that's okay okay the bride hears me Hallelujah is this okay who changed the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever we do it don't don't look at the Pentecostals oh Bishop this is Bishop said Bishop Bishop said bishop and we do the same thing your pastor become your God I never read I I know I haven't reached that level here amen yes sir let me tell you all something y'all those people who deliberately boycott uh God gonna deal with you you did some of y'all deliberately misses it yeah yeah and you don't know the table has been prepared for you put it this way try you and to test you you know what I'm saying you know why cause y'all looking back be like this over here and you ain't open foreign he talks to me remember it's been a long time but there are times I've been able to see and hear things yeah yeah that was in the apostolic church and I say that because it was God I thought I was losing my mind but when I found out that the things that I was seeing yes you know sometimes people think only brother Brandon can see Visions but it happens to me and I'm nowhere near brother Branham I couldn't read or write my my mom I got a brother who's a Baptist who has a gift of a vision I don't know sometimes you recognize sometimes but I say like this my brother who she who saw a vision while he was division traveling in a truck he breaks out into a vision and a bomb is getting ready to hit the truck this is the exact place soon as his truck you will see them as soon as this truck as soon as his truck comes to the place survey amen he ended up in the hospital he literally but he was saved his son is soft didn't even know and he was telling me that and I said oh my brother I never knew you had Visions too he said brother books don't I just don't understand I just know that when God gave me my wife and I saw her in a vision first nobody can take that from me and it's proven to be God you all right y'all might as well just sit back and relax y'all owe me some time see the cultural influence of Rome Church you see because Rome was a place of immorality you know they were brutal he's he's a very they had all kinds of Arenas killing each other immorality that is a spirit and if you allow yourself to get lukewarm yourself [Applause] come on somebody it's nothing but the truth I'm almost done who are you I'm speaking to everybody here who are you and how do you know who you are Who You Are the only way you'll know who you are especially when you come to God you must know him he must know you Hallelujah is that right is it right that's what the message came to do is from amnesia lots of memories this message take us Beyond 20 23 News it's both and you're in the message that even when we were children God was still in our lives even when we were children Hallelujah and because of that seed and because of that representation we're sitting here today let me say it like this don't let the devil rob you take away your inheritance and hey man Hallelujah come to know who you are what baby just said that some baby said Hallelujah who said that come on sister out of the mouth of babies perfected praise what made her say that just keep your feet people got me right here she said Hallelujah even I heard that one he's the Lord on there Hallelujah we know who we are the evidence Hallelujah and howdy of the Holy Ghost see you can't say I got it and don't follow the truth the truth will lead the truth anoints the believer Hallelujah the truth will bring you into total truth this Satan from every that's ever been told Hallelujah you know Satan you can lie on you set you free they can accuse you why because once you know who you are and you know that you got Angels everybody help me here the Bible said we have a joke Hallelujah Elijah told us we've got more of them there's more angels with us hallelujah amen let me quote let me give you another quote if you don't mind y'all might as well hold up I'm almost done see what time is 11 39 . y'all some of y'all just got here amen [Laughter] now I am sure that you have noticed that those whose names we're a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and the worship of him though they did not worship according to truth they didn't go all the way so he liken you as Judas if you don't go all the way [Music] and there is no way you can say I got the Holy Ghost and there is no change in your life the Holy Ghost will change you know you know there's so many y'all some of y'all people that struggle y'all struggle with whether the message is all all together right I don't know what that's right I mean I know brother Brandon said it sound like a serpent to me and I'm gonna say it just like I feel it's really just sound like a serpent to me God said you're not you're not gonna surely die yeah yeah yeah you're gonna die yes sir some of y'all some of y'all don't even believe that the Bible is fully right do you realize that the Bible is right God is stupid the Bible says foreign [Applause] yeah amen I don't understand it all I know the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of holy ghosts how do you know it's right because I repented I was baptized and I got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] let me tell you something even this eye yeah I'm not going to go through the whole story but it gave me a lot of problems with my life I didn't talk to God first you run into the doctor before when did the doctors become more important than God out of getting down on your knees and praying he said that's what the early church did this is the positions give us all of his points lean not to your own understanding you acknowledge the Lord in all your ways [Music] Hallelujah I screamed that out down and forgot where I was amen you love the Lord let me hurry up because I know like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth oh I'm chosen chosen no meaning see what you're chosen to do excuse me the questions the message should be in you the Bible said you are ridden pistols you and I are supposed to be the expressions yes in other words you know we shouldn't be like later to see if we can say but every day instead of praising him we're complaining it should be this and you look at the church and oh my God he should have done it this way of course he didn't preach it exactly right you know what God hear oh yeah all that and I'm gonna tell you you don't have to answer to me Hallelujah a lot of time you say those things and you think he's gonna get away my mom used to tell me that God go slow walk you boy and God will take a few steps and he's right there with you and the only way getting out of judgment you got repent you got to make things that's if you got the Holy Ghost history he shared knowledge of the Mysteries in Jesus name but when The Showdown came man he sold out for gold and political power Hallelujah he did not go to Pentecost the Holy Spirit or the spirit of God hallelujah he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the words that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost did you hear what he said that is [Music] [Applause] think about that that's from the church age you know how you're going to know how you going what is the word and what is tradition if you don't read your words and we incorporate Traditions into the word of ourselves can you imagine Paul had to go through when he told those Jews all your traditions did he run into opposition absolutely absolutely you mean to tell me that these Gentiles don't need to be circumcised no no they don't no that's your tradition Hallelujah God is beyond that Hallelujah come on somebody it's the truth and you know that's what people don't understand when you're born again you're born into the kingdom of God hallelujah so let me move on about that and traditions were better than the Gentiles Hallelujah and when Paul saw Peter on the table of the Gentiles call him a hypocrite and said you made the School of none effects we've been doing in this message come into perfection Hallelujah you know I really don't care so he's just like I'm at a point right now she's trying unemployment no you know if I if if everybody left and found another church it won't bother me like that because I asked God for genuine Christians now I'm not here playing church I don't just I don't see that happen too many times I want somebody who loved the words Hallelujah and somebody when you know you wrong make it right you know the wife covered for the husband she covered his sins and you know what God did he says he killed them both Elizabeth shout down in heaven yeah he killed them both you can't lie for your husband you can't lie for your sister you know oh Lord get him out of that Pulpit y'all somebody help him help me I love you people I love you I hate the term new people but I love all of you I wouldn't be preaching like I'm not trying to say but I stand with the words Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Oh Sister Amy that that was wonderful I needed I needed that let go and let God have his way Jesus and I was going to let him have his way out of them she interrupted the words that was the anointing this is his service not mine that's all I'm saying because you know y'all get the see that's that's the only thing about conduct and all that I don't like let's just like because conduct and order was given to bring you know brother Branham never did it that way so much so unto the church now is dead because they shut the Holy Spirit out um that's not what it was given for is let me hit one more thing and I'll try I'll try to close it out how you know they lied teachers and everybody else you know because they say you receive the Holy Ghost you can receive the holy ghosts um because let me tell you the truth or the bad ears when they spoke on the day of Pentecost and all the stuff that you see Pentecostals doing speaking in tongues and nobody know what this is they don't know whether they blessing God hallelujah but on the day of Pentecost when the holy ghost fails they understood that's what they said so how's those tongues that they've got now the same tongs they had on the day of Pentacles is it dead okay how long has been dead brother okay I'm looking for I don't have much longer that might tired I'm tired of Mike out again but just just you know we only have service for most of y'all on win on Sundays anyhow even the whole selfies so I double it up I'll give you a Wednesday and a Sunday Marshall no I'm not talking about to those people who can't come um the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah so what is it that they got over there you know brother Brandon said it like this is one day you're gonna realize they were worshiping the devils hmm you can tell the world about this anyway modern Pentecostals say I just read that that they can receive the Holy Ghost in unknown tongues they have the card before the horse he's on the the la la la la for in Acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect dialect which even unbelievers heard remembers understood Hallelujah this is a quote let me move on now when God is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken we had better speak to us and say what he has already said he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all true but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day did you hear what he said if it's not in you you cannot receive it and you won't hear it no matter how he preaches Hallelujah that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul and you know why I ask you is why do you quote Paul Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever people don't like me quoting brother Brown you need the Holy Ghost episode or need to find a church where they don't quote him it's been revealed man I'm sorry you don't see it yeah I don't understand it it's not my fault it's about my face Hallelujah see that's where so many people Traditions let me tell you something you got millions of people in this world whatever the Pope says and the pope gonna have no Supernatural and the mafia keeping him from getting hurt uh you know what brother Brandon had so it's Harvey he had Angels I'm almost done people then y'all can go eat your Mother's Day dinner just in a minute because I want y'all to get out I know y'all gonna get out here and talk about me so if I just think this is now if the spirit wasn't inside see there's something you wouldn't hear the truth and receive about Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was a sign of the indwelling in the days of Paul let me say it like this let me interject this they did not have a Bible but they had the Holy Ghost and so when the word was preached or sent to them by letter forms that's how I know brother Brandon this message Hallelujah glory to God Roger I'll get carried away let me hurry Hallelujah those who did not have the spirit heard it only as a count of men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sins every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the who had the spirits whichever is the teacher with a capital T heard the word and the spirit in them took the word revealed to them and they were of the group is that heard the messenger and his message that's it I'ma stop there almost I just want to say something you know because listen I I we don't understand and I know a lot of people don't understand my position but I have to give it a count all the things that I say and everything in this church and and and I have a given account for your souls and for those of you who I I'm not your pastor then I guess you don't have to listen but for those of you who I am pastors I am your pastor I trust that you have ears to hear Hallelujah my question is where is your Covenant I mean where's the proof of it you know here I am still preaching on on coming to town on time they're people who've only paid since they've been here years paid their tithes maybe once or twice and when they preach on Queen of Sheba everybody's up out of here but Queen of Sheba brought everything I'm saying but if this man preached the truth I'm backing his ministries just to sit up in this church and do nothing well we want Deacons Hallelujah you don't hardly give I've seen big grown men give a Dollar too loud shame on you you give McDonald's more offering than you do God and God gives you more food than McDonald's Hallelujah I don't mean no harm people don't don't be offended but I'ma say it anyway but you say Brother Bruce will you come pray for my house I'm worthy enough to bless your house God is not worthy enough for you to pay party themes anyway and then you you say well he don't want no deacons because he's afraid that you're gonna steal you ain't paying your tires and you're stealing already you're just not stealing it from me you're stealing it from God Hallelujah anyhow amen hallelujah I just wrote some notes down it's going to be cutting but I'm gonna say it yeah if I'm not your pastor and if you can't find it to back this ministry financially if you don't sell more by paying your tithing and offerings which is your reasonable service really I need you to find another charge we pay electricity here every time you flush to commode that's water it's true see these lights somebody got to pay these bills right my son movies foreign now I'm being carnal let me know in the natural the only natural but we had to put up curtains up there Hallelujah with money that doesn't even come to this church we put all of this up and don't tell me y'all don't make the money I'm not begging for your money I'm trying to get you to see you are robbing God and you think you're getting away from you you're gonna get away with it God will sort you he's gonna he's gonna listen and when it comes don't ask me to pray for you I'm being honest because we gonna need each other oh right now it ain't so tight right now but it's coming so where else where we can be happy and and your families can flourish we preach on Sunday schools and trying to get the kids and then we got we got parents that won't even bring their kids and I'm thinking to myself you're reaping you're gonna reap what you sow you're living in America you can't take this country for granted you better teach your children right here She Gonna Act Like a Man come on and if you don't teach her teach them the importance of being in the image and likeness of God the greatest honors creation to be made in the image and likeness of God who want to be a dog who would want to be a cat nonsense it's nonsense and I'm gonna tell you something as long as you drinking wine and stuff y'all think I don't see I was raised up around drunkards I know the complexions you don't see it but I can see it now they say you know reef is okay you know it's just good I'm I'm marijuana marijuana is okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll keep on keep on with your marijuana marijuana it's okay it's medicine now it's okay no yep you you've Fallen right into the devil's hands and what you're gonna find out is the Holy Ghost is going to leave you because this body that is you are now living in is not your own lives about Tampa defiling the body of God um defiling the body of God desires sorry I'm almost done we don't have to talk about fornication y'all know that's wrong but accusing the elders or you know we do that Hallelujah if I see somebody qualify we'll put them there but I'm gonna tell you now if you're a deacon you're not gonna be drinking wine and you're gonna pay your tithing you're not gonna be a preacher not pay your tires well what you know y'all looking at me because I think the tires ain't coming no no no no that's not what I'm thinking you're cursed how can I bless something that's already occurred you said well can I know I I can't be cursed I got clothes you know I got you know uh a house and Israel had all of that they had a greater blessing than you their clothes didn't wear out the shoes didn't go bad and they still was cursed so you don't go by your natural appearance I'm almost done I know y'all gonna be glad but I'm almost done like I said earlier the shepherd will follow the Sheep the Sheep follow the shepherd there's a lot of people missing this morning I won't go there but I know a week or so ago two weeks ago everybody was tired and I'm like they must have had a party tonight all of the Brethren had that looks like whatever y'all was doing y'all better make it right with God the Panthers [Music] I'm talking about y'all know y'all a little group say it they gonna be mad with me anyway yeah I'll be grouping y'all be grouping and you think the Holy Ghost don't see y'all grouping oh yeah yeah yeah oh my y'all got a buddy system going on that's all right the Church of the Living God oh we live for God and not for ourselves you all right with that as I said earlier and I'm close yeah it's not like I want somebody to leave because I want you to get right [Music] you understand me you're hindering the church I think it was Brother Rich and I was talking supposed to differ Richard and people have attended to say don't affect anybody that's wrong that's not true a can that they were connected Hallelujah and we're connected to each other is that right and hidden sin will call somebody to lose their victory that's brother Brandon said this 400g that government reiterate this this is not a Congolese Church neither is it in America this is not a Catholic church where you can add to your Creeds and dogs this is the Church of the of of of the Lord Jesus Christ he cares nothing about your tradition it is your tradition that makes the word of God of none effects it's not if it's not the Church of Jesus Christ then we are just a foreign God cannot solve problems God solves everything ask them happy and all I'm asking especially Brethren if you come to be a part of this church then you need to join me in the battle shoulder to shoulder A House Divided can't stand um nobody you you ever see me trying to be something great in here I tried to be your brother I tried to be your friend Hallelujah there's not one person in here that can ever say that you need it and I didn't come to your rescue I have never been prejudiced against anybody right even though I know remember that you don't you don't completely agree with me [Music] that's not my concern right because no man see eye to eye but I am concerned about you agreeing with the word measures right brother Brandon said hold on G if a church don't believe in drinking wine I'm using this for example he used other illustrations he said and even if I believe that I could it Dimensions he said I wouldn't do it because the church don't believe we should that's what divine loves do you have a freedom and maybe your conscience don't bother you but I'll give you one suggestion and I know it ain't always the brothers I see y'all sisters y'all be doing a little something yourselves I told you I know the look and I'm gonna say it like this because I know I've seen it I've seen it I've seen that when somebody passed in the family y'all figure y'all got a right to drink ease the pain what happened to the Holy Ghost like yes what happened to the real comforter see y'all getting quiet because y'all know it's true I don't seen this thing more than once y'all think I can't see it's wrong amen so like I said in closing yeah it's all right see I want everything that I've said to be thought about deeply thought about it because this church is going to move forward I like to move forward with you but even if it's without you we're going to move forward has nothing to do with whether I love you or not I say these damn because I do I am sorry that you don't love me this is pray presence God oh mighty [Music] Prince of
