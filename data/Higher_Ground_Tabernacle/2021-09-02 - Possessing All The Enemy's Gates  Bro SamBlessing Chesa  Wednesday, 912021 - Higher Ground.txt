evening amen for we have come to feast on the manna from heaven wherever the caucus is that's where the eagles will be gathered so good to see um we have we have a visitor that came with brother isaac another time feel welcome feel free in the house of the lord amen um just before we go to the word let us sing this song he is lord he is risen from the dead and he is lord [Music] [Music] and every [Music] feet singing [Music] is the lord he has a reason he has reason from the dead [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] that my jesus [Music] christ one more time sing is lord yes [Music] for he has a

diseases his lord over all your situations amen hallelujah let his holy name be praised whilst we are standing let us open our bibles to the book of genesis 22. genesis chapter 22 verse start reading from verse 16. verse 16 says and bomb and said by myself have i sworn say the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing will i bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies amen lord ed blessings to the reading of his word we may take our seeds amen for um for a short time we just want to speak on this uh this title possessing the enemy's gate amen i want to focus on the last part where he says and thy sea shall possess the gate of his enemy we see god was making a covenant with abraham because god noticed every time he made a covenant with men men always failed men were not able to hold or keep the end of the deal then god said not this time this time around i'm swearing by myself you don't have to do anything but i whatever i say it is up to me and i'm going to get it done amen and there is nobody else who's higher than god himself that's why he swore by himself amen he said man you have failed enough now this time around my covenant with you it is not going to fail because i have sworn by myself and he says thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies this was a promise to abraham and all he said that was going to come after him amen so he decided to make the covenant by himself it says despite abraham's shortcomings you know abraham made a lot of mistakes he had a lot of failures he made a lot of shortcomings but god said despite all of that i'm going to stand with my word i'm going to stand by my word and i will keep my covenant and he made it for abraham and his seed that came after him all of isaac and his descendants that promise it was to them amen so they knew that there is no enemy that's going to stand upon before them because they had this promise that they shall possess the gate of each and every enemy of them amen we know abraham he fought he went uh he went for lot when lord was uh was kidnapped by those ten kings and he went he trained the men in his own house but he went after 10 kings in their armies and overcame them while he was standing on god's promise he knew that god was able to come through for whatever he has said so he was not scared of anything abraham he just trained the man the local husband in his house and they went to fight kings they knew victory was certain because god's covenant never fails amen and he carried all the promise down through the israelites we know the israelites they always want why god was always on their side they could have lost some wars but we know they want the battles because that was god's covenant to them we read in the bible of a man called shamga he was there and they were being taken advantage of by the fearless times and he was right there over and over their harvest were being taken and after some time he looks at his family the prophet of god talks about it he said he looks at his wife he says his wife is starving she's skinny he looks at his daughter he sees the daughter is starving and then he realized he said but wait i'm a son of abraham we have a promise that we are supposed to possess the gates of all our enemies not some gates but all the gates so he knew that that promise was going to keep him amen so when he saw 600 philistines they were right there he said i don't care enough is enough today is the day i'm just going to stand upon god's promise i do not know how i'm going to overcome i do not know how this is going to come to pass i'm just going to go in my might and i know god will take care of me that's why he took the closest thing that was to him and ox god and he went after 600 philistines and he slew all of them why because he was standing on god's covenant he was standing on the promise of god amen amen he realized that he had abraham's blood flowing in his veins and he said i know god is duty-bound to keep his word amen the prophet god tells us that we we are sons of abraham we are the seed of abraham so because you are a seed of abraham that covenant pertains to you as well amen it doesn't matter what the enemy how long the enemy has kept you taken advantage of you made you live under your own privileges if you just realize that that promise that you shall possess the gates of your enemy walk out god's word is going to keep you amen god's word is going to sustain you god's word is going to give you victory amen and we know in galatians chapter 3 verse 27 says for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek neither is born or free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if ye be christ then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to that promise so if you are in christ and you have accepted christ as your personal savior you are abraham's seed so that covenant pertains to you you gotta hold it on tight because that is your inheritance it is yours that you are supposed to possess the gates of the enemy and god saying in blessing i will bless thee so no one can curse that which god has blessed amen because god's word always come to pass god is not a man that he should lie neither is he a son of man that he should repent whenever he speaks the word it comes back only to him after he has accomplished that which he sent it out for amen amen so we gotta know as long as we are alive we're gonna have battles in our lives we're gonna have we're in a constant battle until we die sometimes we lose wars sometimes we fail but if we just remember that god's promised aid we shall possess the gates of all the enemies amen all those gates so we might lose a war but we know we will win each and every battle amen because we are more than conquerors how can we be conquerors and we are not winning anything amen so we got to stand on god's promise you know that each and every battle that comes our way we will overcome we might lose today and say i've lost this war but keep on get get up and keep on going that's right amen because there's a promise that says many other afflictions of the righteous but god shall deliver out of them all not some of them but out of them all and the prophet of god gave us a definition of a righteous man a righteous man is not someone who never done wrong but it's someone who when he falls he gets up and keep on going so whenever you feel like you have lost one walk do not let do not fall in despair get up and keep on going we have a promise of overcoming the battle we have a promise to win each and every battle that comes our way amen so we know god keeps his word and we are heirs to abraham according to his word according to his promise so if you are a descendant of abraham by faith spiritually your name is written in that covenant it says your name right there you are going to live in this age and that covenant pertains to you so when you are right there you gotta claim the benefits of that covenant you say lord i'm having these battles where is my possession where is me overcoming those enemies because your name is in that covenant god has to make sure that comes to you amen so it doesn't matter how many trials what how many battles you face you know we are promised that we are more than conquerors hallelujah so every trial comes before any victory there is no victory without fighting there is no you cannot be a conqueror without fighting a battle the prophet god says they come at time first that they had to come a trial there's always trials it's always darkest before day in nature and you'll always have trials before you have victory if there is no war there is no victory so for you to claim into that identity that god has given you that you are a modern conqueror you gonna know that their trials coming your way it doesn't matter what they are but you know that i am promised to be more than a conqueror so if i walk and i overcome this trial that i'm facing i know there is victory that's certain for me because god has promised it and he has won that victory for me already and he said abraham would never possess the gate of the enemy until he was tried first and you'll never possess the gate of that enemy until you go through the trials some through the waters some through the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood god leads all his children so you must first be tried because when you are being tried you are being perfected into the stature of christ amen you just cannot be perfect without going through any trial because we know that our that our perfection comes through our suffering our perfection comes through our trials why we will come through it you know when gold is being purified they put it in the fire that's how they can tell it's real gold because it burns all the impurities and then at the end of the day when the when the god panel when he looks at the gold and he sees his face in the he can say this is pure gold it has been tried in the fire but if it is in pure gold when they put that temperature that gold false gold will burn up amen but we know we are the children of abraham we are god's children we know we will walk through the fire that fire will not harm us it will not burn us but it will only purify us when we come out at the end we will come out victorious we will come out better than we were before amen because god always keeps his promise and god gave us prayer which is what we overcome by some at one point prophet god says prayer is the most powerful weapon that god placed in the hands of man so prayer we can approach god 24 7 with our needs there is no restriction to say at this time god does not have customer service that that that ends at 5 p.m no his line is open all the time go to him in prayer and he is there to supply your needs he is jehovah rapha he healed all our diseases he is jehovah jireh he supplies all our needs so when you come to him in need and say lord your covenant says that i shall possess the gates of my enemy is this enemy that's troubling me give me the strength and might so i can go and overcome the enemy god is able to give you that victory amen because he always stands in his word and he said if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he said i will hear from heaven not only does he hear but he will hear and he will answer that prayer so you know that god has an ear open for you you are his child he is not going to shine you away because he is there for you prophet god says the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is prayer it even changes everything it even changed the mind of god one time god told his prophet to go up and tell the king he was going to die and the king turned his face to the war and said lord i beseech you to consider me i've walked before you with a perfect heart i need 15 years more and god granted the king his prayer he granted his request and he gave it to him what more you and me bought by jesus precious blood that he spilled on that cross if we come to god in prayer he can't supply your needs if you come to him he can grant your request knowing that god will answer your prayer when you come to him amen so that's why the bible says pray without ceasing amen because that's where you get the strength you just don't spend two weeks you're not praying then you just come and you pray this one time and you wake up a warrior now you gotta pray without ceasing you know when when when uh jesus and the disciples were on the boat you know he came there and he said peace be still why he was coming from praying in the mountain that's where he got his strength these disciples they would they were not prayer warriors they didn't know what was going on before then so pray praying gave jesus the solid foundation of the miracles that he had he was god in himself but he kept on praying constantly so we need to pray and stand upon god's promises amen amen when it comes to anything that god has promised he says brother brown says take the initiative and stand right there god made the promise he is obligated to his promise as long as you are abraham's seed he has got to answer that amen god has to answer that why because you are abraham said so you got to have that faith to know that with this faith whatever i ask for i am going to receive it because you know god is not a man that he should lie whatever he says in his word he's got to give it to you so the more you use your faith the stronger it gets faith is like muscles the more you use it the more bigger they get the more confident you get so there's always a fight between there's always a battle between faith and doubt and faith the more you feed faith the bigger it becomes because the bible says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god it does not say faith comes by having heard the word not that you have heard and then you already have faith no you constantly keep on hearing the word of god and faith comes by that the more you use it you are growing your your um your faith muscles and you know whenever you come across a situation you're able to overcome those enemies gates why because you are using your faith god is helping you to build it up and you know there's nothing that can stand in your way amen we know we have both good and evil within ourselves the thing that you feed most is the one that overcomes the other that's right so you have faith and faith faith and doubt exist but we know we are children of god we only have faith on the inside but if you don't feed that faith doubt will overcome you you will not be able to overcome that's why we have to stay focused and make sure we are focusing on the word of god and not being distracted by the things of this world because those things will deem our focus and we end up looking at those storms of life like peter did and he lost his faith because he was not focused on the word the word of god said to him come he was alright as long as he was looking at the word but as soon as he turned away and started looking at his circumstances that's when doubt started overcoming his fear his faith and he started drowning and he said lord help me please and then he was able god was jesus was able to redeem him and save him so we got to make sure we stay our focus on the word that's where our faith comes from amen we keep on hearing that word keep on listening to those tapes keep on reading that bible that's where our faith comes from that's where our strength comes from hallelujah from the word of god you know the word the other time when you're saying the word carries the same authority as the person who is spoken when jesus said let there when god in the at the creation of the world he said let there be light light had to be there why because the word that he had spoken had the same authority as god himself amen many times when people at when people tell you oh uh can you go do this and that you're going to ask first who said that because your action is going to detail is going to be determined how fast you carry out that action is determined by who said it if it is someone of a higher authority you know you would do it right then if it is your friend you do it in your spare time you're like okay i'll do it when i get time if it is someone who's probably lower than you you have a decision you might not even do it but when i when god said let there be light there is no higher authority than god himself so light had to be there so we we noticed that when jesus was walking on the earth in his three years of ministry he was the word made flesh so that was the same as god speaking he was using the word to possess the gates of the enemy he overcame satan after his 40-day fast why by speaking the word because that word has authority so he was using that word to overcome he was using that word to win his all of his battles amen because that same word that says men shall not leave by bread alone and he overcame satan is that same voice that said let there be light is that same voice that when demons were being cast out from the layman from the blind man and they would run away because they understood the authority that was in the word and that authority in the word it was possessing all the enemies gates so that's why you and me when we stand on that word we know that word it still has the same power to overcome to same power to possess all the gates of the enemy because that word has never failed that's why we got to keep on eating the word because we become what we eat the more we eat the word the more we become the word so when we speak it is like the word that is speaking and we know we can possess the gates of the enemy with the faith that we get from hearing the word amen so jesus performed all these miracles using the word he possessed all the gates of the enemy possess the gates of sickness possessed the gates of all the people who were afflicted because we know he was a hundred percent man and he was a hundred percent god amen you know when he when they were at the waters when they were at the sheep when he was sleeping and the calm the the storm came the satan said this is my time to get him but he didn't know whom whom that was he didn't know the kind of power that was lying in jesus the prophet of god said the devil said we got him now he's asleep we'll drown him he was a man tired and weary laying on the back of that boat there with a pillow somewhere sleeping but brother when once he arose and put his foot on the braille of that boat and looked up and said peace be still the winds and the waves obeyed him why that was more than a man speaking that was god in that man so you gotta know to call jesus on the scene when you have storms of life coming your way you know he just has to say peace be still why he will overcome he will possess those gates by the power of the word he has done it before and he will never fail amen so whatever he said it has to go it has to come to pass because god's words never fail in psalms the bible says whatever it says thy word or lord is established in the heaven so everything has to be established in the heavens first before it happens here on earth so when a child of god is going through any situation you know that there's something else that's going on in heaven we are not just bound we are only confined to to these dimensions but we know there's something going on when job was going through his trial he did not know that there's a conversation that had gone on between god and satan he did not know that but something had already happened in the heavens that was affecting his life while she was here on earth so when he was there he is struggling his um his his kids are dying all his cows ghosts and whatever everything was being taken away from him he did not understand what was going on he knew he was getting in at trial but in the heavens it was already established god had already said i know my servant job he will never ever forsake me my servant job he will always stand for me so whatever he went through god's word was already established in the heaven it had already been said so job had no other option but to overcome each and every trial that came his way amen he had no other option but to overcome each and every temptation that came hey man so we know everything happens in heaven first before it happens on the earth the prophet of god says sometimes we watch things going on here on earth but there's something going on in heaven all the same time we might not be able to see it but it's going on anyhow amen we all know of the story of michaela and ahab they were right there and michael was prophesying and he had he had said a word and god had to make sure that comes to pass they had a conversation in heaven although people here on earth ahab maike and uh zedekiah and all of those they had the showdown going on there was a conversation that was happening in heaven and god was saying what shall we do so that the word of the prophet comes to pass and he had to send one he had to send a lying spirit to go and anoint these prophets so that the prophecy of elijah would come to pass so things were already happening in the heaven but on earth they could not see it so if we know but we know that jesus our god he is the mass of everything that happening that's happening in heaven everything he's saying everything in his word he said about us it is only for our good because in jeremiah he says i know the plans that i have for you plans for you to prosper so it is nothing but only for you and my good you know those three hebrew boys when they were up there in um when they were about to be thrown in the fire there was a conversation that was going on in heaven gabriel said let me go go say no not this time the three hebrew boys they were just praying they did not know what was going on they just had their faith they were just standing on god's word that says thou shalt serve no other god and they said you know what even if god doesn't even hear us we are not going in even if he doesn't come to save us we are just going through we are not going to fail him then god heard it and there was a conversation that was happening in heaven and he worm would say you know i once destroyed the earth in the days of noah i can go with water and quench out the fire god said no you are not going this one i am going alone and he came down and he possessed the gates of those of shadrach meshach and abednego's enemies so we know whenever we are having a trial whenever we are having a situation to handle there is a conversation that's happening in heaven god is dispatching angels god already has a plan that's there to deliver you god already has a plan in place so that you can be delivered so that you can possess the gates of the enemy amen all you just have to do is stand on his word and he will let it come through because remember he has a covenant with you if you're a seed of abraham he has a covenant with you that you shall possess each and every gate of the enemy amen so you know that in the heavens there is a plan that's already set so you are not going to fail amen you are not going to come down as a as a loser you are not going to come down as a coward but you will come through as a conqueror you will come through as a victor because jesus said i have lost none of them that you gave me so he will make sure he will come after you he will leave the 99 to follow you the only one that has gone astray or to follow you the one that has that is being troubled he will leave everything to come and follow you because we know that one soul is worth ten thousand worlds so he is not going to let you go he's going to get ahold of you he will have a conference for you because why you are a seed of abraham and he has a covenant so he has to make sure that that covenant stands he has to make sure that that covenant it comes to pass because you are a seed of abraham so whatever you are dealing with whatever situation you are dealing with just hang in there help is coming there is a conference that is going on god is saying what shall we do look at my son look at my daughter this is happening to them he is already sending angels to say go help him go deliver him go possess the gates of the enemy and at the end of the day you will come through victorious so you should not rely on people but you rely and stand on the word of god because if you rely on people what are you going to do when people everybody walks out on you what are you going to do you'll be stranded but if you stand on the word of god you will never leave you the word of god is god himself he said i will be with you even in you till the end of the world so i don't care if everybody else walks out on me so long i am holding on to the word you know of elijah he was going to starve but there was no man there was no person who was coming to help him god had sent a he sent a ravens that came with food and fed him for three years so you do not need to rely on people because when you rely on people and they help you out you're going to give that glory to those people you're going to give glory to that person who helped you but god is a jealousy god he just wants all the glory to himself so rely on the word of god god will always come through for you amen in psalms 23 uh david said thou prepared a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointes my head with oil my cup run it over run it over he gives you more than you need he has more than enough hallelujah he is el shaddai the all-sufficient one it means god of plenty it means he is more than enough so all we just need we need to be patient he will give us our hearts desire because he said in his word he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever think of so we if we stand on the word of god we know god will never fail us if we stand with man man can fail us men can walk out on us but god he is that friend who walks in when everyone else is walking out is that friend who is willing to help you when no one else is willing to help you if you cry and say lord save me just like you saved peter the bible says immediately jesus saved him so if whatever you are going through you just cry and say lord help me lord save me immediately he is going to save you because he says i have lost none of them that you gave me so he's not going to let you get lost in a battle he's not going to get you lost in a trial or in a temptation he's going to come and he will save you so for every victory you got to fight you got to come out more than a conqueror you gotta fight more than one battle for you to be a conqueror for you to be a warrior it means you have overcome more than one battle so we gotta be they stand on god's word the three hebrew boys they stood on god's word and when they came out of the fire not even one hair of on their head was burnt why because they stood on the word of god daniel he was cussed in the den of lions that had been stabbed for so many weeks but because he was standing on the word of god he came out he possessed the gates of his enemies and he came out everyone marveled how did you do this why because he was always praying and he was standing on the word of god amen god never fails you god always comes through for you amen so if you rely on him god is the master strategist he is a five-star general that he has the best strategy that there is so you know you will never fail because you have the five-star general on your end whatever he says do you do that amen whatever he says go do you go do that don't ask me any questions just go because you know he's the master strategist whatever he says it has to come to pass amen i heard this story one old man who was carrying a bible and people asked them why you carrying that bible do you even know how to read it he says i don't know i don't know how to read it and say why carrying it he says because it's the word of god and they said so why carry it if you can't read it and he says well i believe it from cover to cover why because it says holy bible so i believe it so i might not understand everything that that is in the word but i still believe it because i know the word of god never fails and it is there for me it is what will keep me and god we serve our god who is a master strategist you know in the days of noah he commissioned noah to go build an ark with using gopher wood that had never happened before and people criticize noah see how can you build an arc using golfer wood it's it it's a it's a wood that is porous that when it gets into water it sucks in all the water and it made absolutely no sense and we know in these days they were more scientifically way ahead of us right now and then it just it was just ridiculous it made no sense why are you building an ark with golfer wood but god he was the master strategist he knew that he told noah to to to boil that that uh gofferwood in the evergreen tree sap that pitch so when it was laying in the it sucked in that pitch that evergreen tree pitch and then when it came in into all those pores it was as light as light as could be but it was as strong as steel god knew what he was doing no scientists in those days could figure that out but god had already had already that figured out there was a master strategy so that noah could survive the storm so that noah could survive the flood that was going to come so it did not make sense but god's strategy it came out they say there's an approximate of three 3.8 million animals that were in the ark i do not know if there was any ark or any ship that was going to be able to to contain or house all those animals but because it was god's plan it was god's strategy he made he had everything measured to the t he knew that if you do this it is going to come out and in the same time he was giving us he was showing a type of the deity of human beings that when we you are a wood when you lay in the presence of god and you allow god to suck in within you you will become as strong nothing can stand before you it doesn't matter how many floods of life that come for you it doesn't matter how many storms are coming your way you will never drown you will never sink why because you are god's master plan you are right there when you allow god to feel in yourself the other time brother ben was preaching on how we have to be empty and willing for god to fill us so we got to be that god forward we allow god to fill us in with his life and when he fills us in we know we will be solid and we can crush each and every wave we can crash through each and every storm nothing can stand why that was god's strategy god knew what he was doing amen so it doesn't matter what storm it is a storm of disease comes your way a storm of depression a financial storm you got a work place storm family storms that's going on it doesn't matter internal storms god has already if he is in your life he has you sealed he knows you will float on all those storms you will float on all those floods and nothing will sink you god will keep you he said i've never lost all of them that you've given to me so he has kept you he will keep you if you just stand on his word and say what you do and say and do what he says you do amen because god we know we serve a god who is a master strategist amen so you might not understand what he's doing but just do it anyhow he knows what he's doing he is the five-star general that's in our corner amen hallelujah we know he led moses and the children of israel they were just going they did not know where they were going then they realized we in front of us there's a sea at our right these mountains at our left there is a mountain and desert and behind pharaoh's army is coming they had no idea what was going on and the egyptians thought wow their god is really a poor strategist but god knew what he was doing he was setting a trap so he could annihilate all the egyptians all the pharaohs army and everything but when the israelites were looking they started crying lord what are we going to do moses forgot even the miracles that god had done through him and he is standing right there he has nothing to say but god said just stand still and see the hand of god when you open that sea and the children of israel went when pharaoh's army tried to follow they were all flooded why because that was the result of god's master plan so his plan for your life never fails just know he is the master he is the master strategist he will never fail you he made gideon to win a battle with only 300 men something that had never happened before he gave them a strategy and that strategy worked although it looked ridiculous or it made no sense but god knew what he was doing the walls of jericho fell by a shout we have never heard of any walls falling by shouting but god knew what he was doing and they just circled around and all they did was shout and they got victory why they were listening to god's strategy they were listening to what god has said and samson we know samson killed a thousand philistines with a job on from an ass this is because why he was using god's strategy in george's 15 15 it says samson he had a new job on i used to think that it was a dried-up job and that he just found wherever that was he was lying but then the bible says he found a new job on can you project um georges 15 15 if you can please judges chapter 15 it says that um samson he saw when he was being attacked by the field by the philistines he saw a new job on so i was just in when i was starting i was just thinking how a job of of a dead animal that's laying right there how can it become new how could it be new and if it's from a dead animal that's dead and gone if it is lying there then it should have come from a dead animal and it cannot be new but the bible says it was a new job on so god made that job on for him he knew that samson was going to need it he opened the way he knew that samson was going to need to possess the gates of his enemy and he says and he found in a new job on of an ass and put it and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men there with it so god made a custom-made job on for samson because he knew samson was going to need that victory he knew that samson needed to possess the gates of his enemy so he laid he laid that job on right there and when samson picked it up that was a predestinated weapon that he had to use for him to overcome amen and he was under god's commission to possess all the gates of the enemy and he slew all those 1000 philistines and he brought victory into the camp of the israelites because he was acting on god's god's commission so now faith is a personal revelation that god gives to you to overcome whatever battle you have god gives you faith to come out of it god gives you faith for you to get healed that's a custom-made weapon no one else has the same revelation as you have for whatever situation you have so don't listen to men listen to what god is telling you because whatever he's telling you that's that weapon he has created to see you will overcome through that so and he allows you to come through him anytime 24 7 when he rant when he rent that curtain that went into the holy of holies he was opening up making free access so that you and me we can walk in at any time of the day whenever we are in need we can walk in through into the holy of holies and he will give us victory and he can give us our harsh desires if only we have faith to know that he can do it for us so all these people were talking about god delivered them because they were abraham's seed they had abraham's blood running in their veins what about you and me amen at temple of jesus christ we are housing jesus inside of us when you receive the holy ghost you are housing jesus himself within you if he did it for them then why can't he do it for you why can't you overcome and possess the gates of your enemies god can give that to you because you are abraham's seed through jesus christ and you have him dwelling in within you amen amen we know 2 000 years ago jesus came down and he was the promised seed of abraham that jesus that god gave to abraham although isaac was just a shadow isaac was there he was the seed of abraham but jesus was promised son that god was promising to abraham you know he possessed the gates of satan by the word when he was tempted by satan on all counts satan will come and try and tempt you with the word because he knows if you are a matured christian you do not even have the thirst for alcohol he's not even going to bring that to you but he's going to bring you the word and try to to to confuse everything on do about the word with you that's what he did with eve he came and he just changed the word because he knew that's that's where they were standing on when he came to jesus he tried to misconstrue the word and says you are the son of god if you do this you can create bread but jesus knew he says no this is not my time yet and he overcame he possessed the gate of the enemy by saying the spoken word amen amen and we know the one final time he did possess the gate of the enemy was when he went on the cross of calvary that was the greatest victories of them all when he walked right there we know when he was in the garden of gethsemane and he was thinking he was right there he was going he was undergoing through a lot of stress and he was praying until they say he had a he had sweat of blood his flesh was telling him i can't do this but in his spirit he knew if i don't go then who is going to go he knew there was victories to be worn he knew there was you to be healed he knew there was you to be delivered there was you to be saved that's why he was there he said lord if i could let this pass pass me by but while she was right there he saw you he saw you he saw me and then he said but nevertheless let your will be done i will go through and i will do it because he had you and me on his mind and he said i am going to come through and possess the gate of the enemy one last time once and for all and it is done that's why when he pressed through he was beaten and he went through all that but then when he came to the cross of calvary and he said it is finished what was he talking about he was talking about all your battles he was talking about all your situations all your sicknesses all your depression everything you were going to go through he said it is finished amen and then when he said it is finished and then he died afterwards that was not the end of the story we know he went down into the gates of hell and he went down to possess those gates and the prophet of god says but one day one glorious day the royal seat of abraham born of a virgin when he walked earth he was a true seed of abraham he possessed the gate of sickness of the people he possessed the gate of affliction all in the garden of gethsemane in the court that morning he possessed the gates of temptation he was tempted to let go but he said no i am going to go through because he had you and me on his mind and he died down at the cross hell taken his pressure sold the bible said his soul descended into hell that's exactly right he captured his soul and took him down there but brother on that third day he possessed the gates of death hell and the grave and rose up the third day and overcome it all he took sickness he took death hell and the grave and everything and he jerked off that that gate and tonight you and me we are more than conquerors while his seat shall possess the gaze of the enemy he possessed each and every gate he conquered every sickness he conquered every sin so there is no sin that can trouble you there's no sickness there's no disease that can trouble you why because he conquered everything he conquered hell he conquered the grave and he possessed that gate of them all and we are in him more than conquerors you know death has a stinger so it went and it stung him when satan was trying to kill him you know a b when a b stings once that's it he doesn't have more than one stinger so death lost its thing when it when jesus overcame it so now death does not have no hold on you sickness does not have no hold in you satan have no hold on you he cannot do nothing to you why because jesus took that sting away so satan can buzz around as much as he wants but he is as he is as harmless as harmless as could be he can do you no harm because jesus possessed the gate he took away that stinger so that when satan comes to you he is powerless he cannot do nothing to you he says but you know what when one of them beats every anchor he's stinging real deep he pulls that singer out and brother when he sucked his stinger into that flesh that wasn't a man he anchored his flesh in emmanuel and when he did he pulled that stinger out i tell you abraham said now he can buzz and make a noise but he does not have no sting one of them coming to his death said oh death where is thy sting grave where is thy victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen so satan he can buzz he can make a big noise he can fuss he can pull you to the hospital put you into the hospital tell the doctor standing right there morning and crying but you look at them right straight in the face and say death where is thy stinger amen because when he came he possessed the gates of all the enemies he possessed all of them so all you and me have to do is just to walk right straight through them because he did it for you and me so he gave us the victory all we just have to do is walk up claim it and say it is in god's covenant and god will give the victory god will be able to heal you god will be able to take you out of depression why because he stands on his word his covenant never fails amen so we gotta use and stand on the word to possess all the gates of the enemy amen let's stand up on our feet let us sing this song we'll be made more than conquerors overcomers in this life we've been made more than called overcomers in this life we've been made victor through the blood of jesus christ we've been made more than cold careers overcomers in this we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus
