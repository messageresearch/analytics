[0:00] he told joshua that all of it i've given
[0:03] to you
[0:05] wherever you place your feet possess it
[0:10] but understand that you're going to
[0:12] fight for it
[0:16] and i've learned by way of rearing
[0:19] children
[0:21] that when you give them an easy life
[0:26] they don't seem to appreciate it
[0:30] but if you teach them how to work and
[0:33] how to labor
[0:35] and how to use their own abilities and
[0:39] talents to gain what they desire to have
[0:43] when they do get to the top they can
[0:45] appreciate it
[0:47] because they know that they have work to
[0:49] get there
[0:51] but anything that's given easily or when
[0:54] you give something
[0:55] to people and you know sometimes you
[0:57] know people just don't appreciate it and
[0:59] and we're living in an age that brother
[1:01] branham call
[1:02] and the scripture calls uh this age
[1:06] age of unthankfulness
[1:10] and we as christians we must be careful
[1:13] that we don't fall into that category of
[1:16] being
[1:17] unthankful god is worthy to be praised
[1:22] and we should thank him for the good and
[1:24] the bad
[1:26] for the sunshine and the rain from the
[1:29] for the valleys and the hills and the
[1:32] mountains
[1:35] in this invitation
[1:39] it wasn't given to everybody it's like
[1:42] having
[1:43] a party or a function
[1:47] you send out invitations but because you
[1:50] send the invitations out
[1:52] doesn't mean the people whom you send
[1:54] those invitations to
[1:56] will attend sometimes people have
[2:00] what they call more important things to
[2:03] do
[2:06] and so has it been in this age
[2:11] but i want you to understand and i'm
[2:13] gonna make it clear tonight
[2:15] what we desire to have has already been
[2:19] given to us
[2:22] but it's not the easy way
[2:25] matter of fact the angel of the lord
[2:27] told brother branham said because you
[2:29] have chosen the harder way
[2:33] the narrow way the straight way
[2:36] a greater portion is laid aside for you
[2:42] and i believe that everyone that follows
[2:44] this message will
[2:46] have a hard time
[2:51] what is required of us to do is
[2:55] naturally impossible
[3:00] no man can add one cubit to his statue
[3:06] but god being gracious in his grace
[3:10] has made this possible
[3:14] for us by giving us an unconditional
[3:17] covenant
[3:20] let us not forget as the psalmist says
[3:24] all of his benefits
[3:27] there are great benefits in serving god
[3:30] and
[3:31] it's a shame that people don't know
[3:34] the blessings of the lord
[3:38] one thing i could say about every
[3:41] victory that i've ever gained
[3:44] is that god was there
[3:47] to make sure i received the victory
[3:54] this is why paul said
[3:57] every victory i gain is is from god
[4:02] and he's made me more than a conqueror
[4:05] and that's so important
[4:07] to believe that you are
[4:10] more than a conqueror
[4:13] doesn't matter how evil this age
[4:17] is god has designed you
[4:21] and jose has ordained you to be a
[4:24] conqueror
[4:27] in the message victory day
[4:30] the prophet god began to talk about all
[4:33] of the victories in the old testament
[4:34] and began to name
[4:36] some of those characters that that had
[4:39] to fight
[4:41] to gain the victory now isn't that
[4:43] amazing
[4:46] how great some of them are and how great
[4:48] some of them
[4:49] were but in all of their victories they
[4:52] still had to die
[4:56] all we have left is records
[5:00] of what they have done but
[5:03] but by god's grace because of their
[5:05] records we can believe
[5:08] and have faith to know that there is
[5:12] a final victory and that this world
[5:16] is not our home see the old testament
[5:19] saints
[5:20] fought because they realized that there
[5:23] there were pilgrims
[5:24] they were they were people who were
[5:26] journeying
[5:28] and there's a better place than this one
[5:31] in this place everything has to die
[5:34] but there's another land where never
[5:37] now no one ever dies
[5:40] in this quote the prophet god says
[5:44] all these great victories
[5:48] were temporal or temporary victories
[5:53] even to moses israel went right back
[5:56] into bondage again
[5:59] always in and out in and out we find it
[6:03] many heroes still fought on and died
[6:07] they still do it in wars in the natural
[6:10] focus of the glass
[6:12] they do it in the spiritual heroes fight
[6:16] and die how we could go on down
[6:20] i've got a whole line of them wrote down
[6:23] here
[6:24] like daniel and the hebrew children
[6:27] and them great victories back there that
[6:30] won
[6:31] their that one victory but they
[6:34] continually find finally come a a
[6:38] thing called death took them
[6:43] see regardless and you know that's what
[6:47] men do even in the natural
[6:51] nobody wants to be forgotten
[6:54] people raise up great statues of men
[6:58] and try to make them immortal
[7:03] but we know that even the statue that's
[7:06] been formed and shaped into their image
[7:10] has a period and a time to end
[7:13] because the bible said that the grass
[7:16] will wither the flowers will fade away
[7:19] but there's only one thing that will
[7:20] last and that is the word of the lord
[7:24] so it doesn't matter how great
[7:28] you become in this world and that's why
[7:31] jesus said
[7:33] what prophet a man to gain the whole
[7:36] world
[7:37] and lose his soul now we have a
[7:41] invitation a city
[7:44] that awaits us and this city is eternal
[7:48] it'll never perish it's been built
[7:53] for souls eternal
[7:56] and there are people amen even on this
[7:58] earth
[7:59] who are eternal who had
[8:02] no beginning nor ending because their
[8:05] lives were
[8:07] in elohim from the beginning
[8:10] now let me go ahead on with the quote
[8:12] please
[8:16] we realize amen that all of these
[8:18] victories are temporal
[8:22] daniel we've heard of that we preached
[8:23] it many times
[8:26] but they continually finally coming
[8:29] a thing called death took them
[8:33] see regardless they went right on
[8:38] see still fighting dying
[8:42] fighting dying victories
[8:46] dying winning victories dying
[8:50] i'm saying all of this to make you
[8:52] understand
[8:54] in order to reach the celestial shore
[8:58] you're going to get victory after
[9:01] victory
[9:03] but there are battles you're going to
[9:04] lose
[9:06] and there are sometimes amen you might
[9:08] get discouraged
[9:10] or frustrated but when you
[9:14] take the word and you understand that
[9:18] you are one of them
[9:21] that can never be defeated
[9:24] and the reason being that you cannot be
[9:28] defeated is because christ won
[9:31] every victory for you even in the time
[9:35] of your failure
[9:36] you steal a victory victorious amen
[9:40] listen it takes pain
[9:44] distress and discomfort to get there
[9:48] hallelujah i don't know about some of
[9:51] you all but
[9:52] i remember when i was a young boy we
[9:53] didn't have cars
[9:55] you know people had cars maybe you know
[9:58] one or two
[9:58] uh you know so many blocks away but
[10:01] every family didn't have a call you
[10:03] didn't have a two
[10:04] two cars and you were blessed to even
[10:05] have a bicycle
[10:08] but we walked sometimes my friend
[10:11] old friends we talk about how many miles
[10:13] we would walk and never think about it
[10:15] we talk our way through the whole
[10:17] journey laugh our way through the whole
[10:19] journey
[10:21] uh but but it didn't mean that times
[10:24] that
[10:24] the journey wasn't tedious it it wasn't
[10:26] tiring it
[10:27] and there are times you perhaps were
[10:29] sick and didn't feel like it
[10:31] we didn't have uh uh uh what they call
[10:34] uh
[10:35] those kind of ambulance now uh back then
[10:37] where you call 9-1-1 and they come
[10:41] most of the time you had to call a cab
[10:44] or something
[10:45] a taxicab in order to get
[10:48] from point a to point b
[10:51] now i'm saying all of these things
[10:53] because i want you to hear what brother
[10:55] branham says because
[10:56] a lot of times we think that we're going
[10:57] to go sweeping through the city
[11:01] this is a warfare this is a warfare
[11:06] and people say well man i don't want to
[11:07] be a christian let me tell you something
[11:09] you're going to suffer whether you are a
[11:11] christian or not and if you're going to
[11:15] suffer
[11:15] you might as well suffer as a christian
[11:18] because if you suffer
[11:19] as a christian there are great rewards
[11:25] hallelujah and the greatest of all
[11:27] rewards
[11:28] is eternal life now you have been
[11:32] invited
[11:33] think about it a piece of dust a piece
[11:37] of
[11:37] dirt david even i've been thinking it
[11:40] was david to call himself
[11:42] himself a worm how low can you get
[11:46] where the wormhole our house is in the
[11:49] dirt
[11:51] not just on top of the dirt in the dirt
[11:55] it's just a low uh uh a creature
[12:00] but god took that and made
[12:03] something out of it and you're it
[12:07] you're what god is forming and making
[12:09] and shaping
[12:10] into his own image but we know because
[12:14] of the world
[12:15] being fallen you've got to have seasons
[12:19] you're going to have your winter you're
[12:20] going to have your summer you're going
[12:22] to have your spring and you're going to
[12:23] have your fall
[12:26] but in all of that you know
[12:29] no matter how dark it gets and this is
[12:31] what i love about it
[12:33] we don't have to ever worry about spring
[12:35] showing up
[12:36] it's coming it's here now the spring is
[12:40] here
[12:40] we don't have to ever worry about summer
[12:43] it's coming and no man can stop it
[12:47] it has been ordained by god now i'm
[12:50] saying all of these things because
[12:52] sometimes
[12:53] when we're going through the winter we
[12:55] don't want
[12:56] the winter to last but so long
[13:00] you know it's true it's true and
[13:04] and and we want to stop it and if i
[13:08] could
[13:08] i would but it's not something you can
[13:11] stop
[13:12] not here in iowa there is a four season
[13:16] that and is separated up like that and
[13:18] it comes just the way it's supposed to
[13:20] you'll never see the winter jumping into
[13:24] summer
[13:26] it's always an inter uh uh uh uh uh
[13:30] how can you say it uh a a a change
[13:33] coming before the
[13:34] summer comes an interval
[13:38] now he goes on and says my thoughts now
[13:41] to you he said it takes pain
[13:46] distress comfort
[13:50] look how the pharisees died to that law
[13:55] through pain distress
[13:58] discomfort why are you saying that
[14:02] because once you understand that this
[14:04] message is grace
[14:06] you're going to go through pain
[14:08] especially if you're a legalist
[14:10] especially if you're working with the
[14:11] law it's going to take
[14:13] pain distress and discomfort
[14:18] why because you realize amen that it's
[14:21] no longer
[14:21] in your hands and that's one of the
[14:24] hardest things for men to do
[14:27] is to surrender to god and let god do it
[14:33] we always want it in our hands hey it
[14:36] never was supposed to be
[14:38] now we find out that rain which bring
[14:41] forth the fruit upon the earth
[14:44] it's born as the porch said
[14:48] in the fields of thunder in a ragged
[14:51] jagged skies but if we
[14:55] didn't have that thunder and the ragged
[14:58] jagged skies
[15:00] the little distilled drops of rain
[15:03] that's been lifted from the seas and
[15:06] distilled
[15:07] from the salt it will not be born
[15:11] and we never think about it that when it
[15:14] rains
[15:15] it is a birth hallelujah
[15:19] it is a birth it is something that god
[15:22] is
[15:22] birthing and that rain once that rain
[15:25] comes hey man you know most of us don't
[15:27] like dogs
[15:28] dogs cows and most of us don't like
[15:31] thunder
[15:32] and don't even talk about lightning but
[15:35] it takes
[15:36] all of that to produce the rain
[15:40] y'all understand me hey you know i never
[15:42] thought about it
[15:43] pulling all of that salt water up there
[15:45] and then now it's got to take all of
[15:47] these things
[15:48] to bring distilled water to you
[15:51] and nobody has ever could ever say well
[15:54] well i
[15:55] tasted the rain it was salty it's never
[15:58] salty
[15:59] because the salt has been taken out a
[16:02] process has been taken
[16:04] for uh taking that salt out it's
[16:07] birth pure clean water well
[16:10] not so much today but back in the day
[16:14] when we didn't have so much pollution
[16:16] right anyway let's move on
[16:19] it would not be it without it it would
[16:22] not be born
[16:24] it takes the lightning thunderblast
[16:27] ragged ragged fearful thing
[16:29] to bring forth the soft petal drops of
[16:32] water
[16:32] it takes pain to bring forth birth it
[16:36] takes
[16:36] dying and as as the clouds die
[16:39] rain is born because rain is a part of
[16:42] that cloud
[16:43] one has to cease to the other one
[16:47] can exist right one has to cease
[16:51] so the other one can exist
[16:54] in other words in order to make this
[16:57] journey
[16:58] law must stop
[17:01] it must come to non-existence
[17:04] yeah you know what i'm saying hallelujah
[17:07] law and grace cannot exist
[17:09] at the same time it can't happen
[17:13] but you know what most of us are afraid
[17:15] to try
[17:16] to trust grace
[17:22] because we're so used to doing
[17:24] hallelujah
[17:25] but it takes pain discomfort
[17:29] hallelujah you know it's so it's amazing
[17:32] because most of the time
[17:34] you know when we come up short
[17:37] when we come up short we feel so
[17:39] condemned
[17:41] hallelujah but you know what god said
[17:43] that the spirit of the word is supposed
[17:45] to take
[17:46] away that guilt consciousness
[17:49] hello the grace of god is supposed to
[17:53] cover it
[17:55] but we're so afraid
[18:00] of grace we think you may not even think
[18:04] of it like that but it's true
[18:06] we have a hard time with it because
[18:10] we've been taught if you do this
[18:11] i give you that if you do this there's a
[18:14] law about that
[18:15] even our children you know get a good
[18:17] grade i'll give you this
[18:18] see so they're used to working in that
[18:20] capacity
[18:22] but doesn't it alarm you when people
[18:25] just give you something and say well
[18:26] you know the lord moved on my heart
[18:30] what is that you know you didn't deserve
[18:32] it
[18:33] you don't deserve it it's god's grace
[18:36] and then you think you know it's hard
[18:37] for people to even receive that
[18:39] they think what's oh what's what's on
[18:41] his mind what's in the back of this
[18:43] and you got to tell people i'm giving
[18:45] this to you
[18:46] because god put it on my heart to do it
[18:48] and there are no strings too
[18:50] attached right is that the truth
[18:54] because real love amen has no strings
[18:57] attached
[18:58] oh it's not because i'm doing for you
[19:00] you got to do for me
[19:01] no sir i'm going to do for you if you
[19:03] don't do for me
[19:06] god so loved the world he set a perfect
[19:09] example
[19:09] about that right he give to the sinner
[19:12] when they don't give back
[19:16] he give to christians and they still
[19:17] don't give back
[19:19] hallelujah but let me move on because
[19:21] i'm talking about
[19:23] getting into this setting in heavenly
[19:25] places
[19:26] in christ jesus remember i told you
[19:28] we've got to think differently
[19:31] how can god take such a thing like you
[19:34] and me
[19:35] and bring you into an equality with him
[19:39] somebody help me here that was a
[19:41] lightning bolt did you feel it
[19:44] see god bringing you into a place of
[19:47] equality
[19:49] not by might not by power but by my
[19:52] spirit saith the lord
[19:54] you got to trust god
[20:01] think about it satan is always trying to
[20:04] reroute us
[20:07] he's always trying to change our our
[20:09] position
[20:10] you know instead of going straight he
[20:12] want us to go these kind of places
[20:14] right is that right abraham yeah abraham
[20:18] never did go straight with the way god
[20:19] told him to do it
[20:21] but because he had an unconditional
[20:23] covenant he still
[20:25] got to the place god ordained him to be
[20:28] y'all understand me and we're like
[20:30] abraham we his seed
[20:32] you know god say go this way we go this
[20:34] way god said go this way we go this way
[20:36] and he always meet us in our arrowing
[20:40] ways
[20:42] there is a city whose builder and maker
[20:46] is god
[20:48] and there is a pull on the believer
[20:51] something that cannot be quenched no no
[20:54] no no stopped hallelujah you we can't
[20:58] explain it
[21:00] all we know is that to the natural man
[21:02] we seem
[21:03] insane oh you're going to be
[21:07] with god i didn't say it i didn't even
[21:10] desire it
[21:12] he called me he saved me
[21:17] he called you he saved you
[21:20] he is the rewarder is that right
[21:23] you and i could not have sought god god
[21:26] sought us
[21:27] we were lost hallelujah is that right
[21:31] and then the bible says blessed is the
[21:32] man who diligently seek me
[21:37] hallelujah greed is your reward right if
[21:40] you seek him he said
[21:41] you will find him what part of that word
[21:45] you don't believe
[21:49] god don't work on your time he works on
[21:51] his own
[21:53] i hope this is a blessing to you
[22:00] for an example as wayward as jacob was
[22:06] jacob had the promise
[22:09] is that right he did he had the promise
[22:12] he was a shyster
[22:13] by nature he he
[22:17] he was a real businessman
[22:20] and he knew how to get away with stuff
[22:23] he knew how to bargain
[22:25] he bargained with his brother esau
[22:28] he bargained with his father-in-law
[22:32] huh and though and it worked
[22:35] and guess what god stepped into the
[22:38] business
[22:39] is that right god stepped in the
[22:42] business showed
[22:43] jacob just how to do it right
[22:46] so it could come out in his favor you
[22:49] because
[22:49] you understand me you understand me his
[22:52] covenant
[22:53] was unconditional
[22:57] because he was abraham's seed his
[22:59] covenant was
[23:00] unconditional and no man can curse that
[23:03] which god is blessed
[23:06] hallelujah jacob was warned of god see
[23:10] if something let me tell you something
[23:11] if you're not being warned in your heart
[23:13] something's wrong
[23:15] right now you should have something in
[23:18] your heart
[23:19] telling you it's time to go back home
[23:24] y'all hear me here was jacob over here
[23:27] prospering
[23:29] and he also saw the attitude of his
[23:32] father-in-law
[23:32] changing but that wasn't what made him
[23:35] go home
[23:36] something was telling him now is the
[23:39] time
[23:41] hallelujah god then blessed you over
[23:44] here
[23:45] all of the natural things that you ever
[23:46] wanted god has given to you
[23:49] right or all that you need god has given
[23:52] to you
[23:52] but now there's a deep call to the deep
[23:55] i got to go back home
[23:57] you know what i'm saying he remember the
[23:59] time he was in bethel
[24:02] and he knew he had to go back home that
[24:04] the house of the lord bread let me tell
[24:06] you something
[24:07] you and i must understand there's a call
[24:09] in you that you cannot explain it
[24:11] you can't understand it but something is
[24:13] telling you
[24:14] it's time for the rapture it's time to
[24:18] get back well it back to the place from
[24:20] which we fell
[24:23] that's our home is not up here we're
[24:25] strangers we're pilgrims
[24:27] but there's something saying the
[24:30] character
[24:31] something's got to move and you know
[24:35] if if no one else knows you know
[24:38] whether the character that you need
[24:42] is in you to face
[24:45] the persecution because esau represented
[24:49] the persecution
[24:51] esau represented the church without the
[24:53] holy ghost
[24:54] you understand me esau represented
[24:57] troubles
[24:58] amen in the last day holly if you don't
[25:00] see esau i
[25:01] see him hallelujah and at the same time
[25:05] that
[25:06] esau was coming your way you were going
[25:08] his way
[25:10] because you got to understand amen they
[25:12] have a sense you know
[25:14] come on let's move on so i'll say it
[25:17] like this
[25:19] jacob was afraid
[25:25] but god had already predestinated him
[25:28] god had already chosen him it was kind
[25:31] of like a
[25:33] a jonah experience
[25:37] jonah thought he was running from god
[25:40] he didn't want to go do what god said do
[25:42] but god had a way of fixing it
[25:44] you understand me you can't get around
[25:46] what god is ordaining you to do
[25:48] there's no way to do it none of his word
[25:51] will come back void
[25:54] and so esau i mean jacob goes home and
[25:56] y'all know the whole story
[25:58] but the thing that gets me at the time
[26:01] of his pull
[26:02] right the bible said if a man hunger and
[26:04] thirst for righteousness
[26:05] he shall be filled hallelujah
[26:09] and that's what east uh jacob was
[26:11] hungering and thirsting for
[26:13] righteousness
[26:13] he wanted to be able to to to
[26:16] that when he got back back and and he
[26:19] meet esau
[26:20] he was able to say i'm sorry
[26:26] you understand me confession
[26:30] i love you brother you understand me
[26:33] he wanted to be able to say that from
[26:35] his heart and he understood amen he did
[26:37] not
[26:38] have the power to do that
[26:41] so one day he thought let me pray
[26:44] now come on it was more than his thought
[26:48] he was inspired to pray and he prayed
[26:52] and god showed up y'all understand me
[26:56] you don't think that jacob prayed when
[26:58] he was with his father-in-law
[27:02] no he did no doubt he did he had prayer
[27:05] time and
[27:06] all this but now this is different it's
[27:09] time for a
[27:09] change that old nature must die
[27:13] if somebody help me it must die
[27:20] and jacob had his good ways too
[27:23] but he still was a shyster
[27:28] but anyway can you imagine how difficult
[27:32] what for
[27:33] for jacob yeah we don't see that do we
[27:36] jacob sent everybody to meet esau but
[27:38] himself
[27:42] all of his children his wives hoping to
[27:44] soften the heart of esau
[27:46] for a moment he forgot god was in
[27:48] control
[27:50] and that's what happens to us we forget
[27:52] god is in control
[27:54] you'll never be in control he's headship
[27:58] you'll never be in control if you're in
[28:01] control you got the spirit of vastly
[28:04] you'll never be in control god is the
[28:07] one that will be in control
[28:09] if you're going to be his wife
[28:13] can i go on sometimes we we
[28:16] we sometimes god will put a choice
[28:19] before you
[28:21] you know and sometimes he want to see
[28:23] what it is
[28:24] you know not that he he's ignorant of it
[28:26] he want to see how you're going to
[28:28] respond
[28:30] right you say oh it's not a test oh yes
[28:33] it is
[28:33] god told abraham i want you to kill your
[28:36] first i want you to kill isaac i want
[28:37] you to sacrifice him
[28:39] something that abraham had never heard
[28:41] of coming from the mouth of jehovah
[28:45] he knew that heathens did it but now god
[28:48] asked me to do it
[28:50] and the bible said he staggered
[28:53] not he didn't complain
[28:57] he didn't question it i know how movies
[28:59] stay well lord no no no no
[29:02] he didn't stagger
[29:06] he did what god requests you see what
[29:07] i'm trying to say when god say do
[29:09] something
[29:10] do it the moment you think about it the
[29:13] reason
[29:14] you're going to reason it away but he
[29:16] put those
[29:17] things in it to see whether so that you
[29:20] can see
[29:21] where the real faith is real faith
[29:27] but abraham had a secret revelation
[29:30] you know what it was he had the
[29:33] revelation that
[29:34] even if he killed his son the same god
[29:37] that gave him to him
[29:39] is able to raise him up
[29:42] it's getting juicy up here
[29:46] but the truth of the matter is that's
[29:48] what it was you understand me
[29:51] if i die in jesus i can come up in jesus
[29:54] now you got to understand paul had a
[29:56] revelation too
[29:57] paul understood that his mission could
[29:59] not be completed
[30:01] until he was done and paul was killed
[30:04] about two
[30:05] three times got straight on up
[30:08] what was it god wasn't finished
[30:14] hallelujah come on
[30:17] you know you think to yourself but i
[30:19] don't die at once i don't want to come
[30:20] and get it
[30:22] but paul was so convinced
[30:26] and convicted with his ministry
[30:29] he knew that he could not go until it
[30:33] was done
[30:33] in fact he said oh it's my desire to go
[30:36] but i have such a love for my brethren
[30:39] it's better for me to stay than to leave
[30:43] somebody help me here what about ruth
[30:45] and naomi i'm coming to the way i'm
[30:46] going just just
[30:47] because i'm just gonna i'm not gonna
[30:49] finish it tonight but
[30:51] ruth and naomi
[30:58] they were there
[31:02] and god and ruth naomi tried her best to
[31:05] discourage
[31:07] ruth and oprah
[31:12] say i i don't have another son for you
[31:14] and
[31:15] what good am i and let me ask you a
[31:18] question
[31:19] if i was able to and get mad again will
[31:22] you wait for the offspring
[31:23] nonsense so i think you need to go
[31:26] back to where you are where you came
[31:28] from is that right
[31:30] see that's how god that's what people
[31:32] don't understand
[31:33] even now that's why so many people go
[31:35] back
[31:36] because god put them in a position where
[31:39] they may have to make a choice
[31:42] and it didn't look good for ruth to go
[31:45] with naomi was going
[31:47] hallelujah why she was a morbiditis
[31:52] i don't suffer and my husband done died
[31:54] over there and more about moab
[31:56] and now you going over here with naomi
[31:58] too
[31:59] oh y'all know how those jews can be and
[32:01] they got a law to kill us
[32:03] you understand the kind of things that
[32:05] the devil was putting in her
[32:07] her head but she wasn't afraid
[32:10] there was an anointing there was a
[32:13] revelation
[32:14] that the god that they only served was
[32:17] the true and living god
[32:19] and she said your god be my god and your
[32:21] people be
[32:22] my people y'all got to understand that
[32:25] was not at just a fly-by-night decision
[32:29] that came from her heart that meant she
[32:32] was willing to suffer whatever she had
[32:33] to suffer in jerusalem
[32:37] bethlehem wherever the jews were
[32:41] you understand me she didn't care if i
[32:44] got to suffer let me suffer
[32:46] but i'm staying with the one that has
[32:49] the word
[32:50] you understand me and naomi represented
[32:53] the
[32:53] old-time way hallelujah she could have
[32:57] gone
[32:57] amen and found her a good husband or new
[33:00] husband
[33:02] but no she wanted to stay within the
[33:04] will of god
[33:06] come on y'all hear what i'm saying this
[33:09] journey is not easy
[33:10] this journey you're going to be tested
[33:13] this journey you're going to be tried
[33:15] hallelujah but thank god for the tests
[33:18] and the trials
[33:19] hallelujah physically you'll be tested
[33:22] financially you'll be tested how do you
[33:25] think mary and martha fell
[33:27] when lazarus died brother adam said it
[33:30] was their approach
[33:32] hallelujah they could have railed jesus
[33:34] and say oh you know we fed you you was
[33:36] in my house and you
[33:38] let my brother die but you see you don't
[33:39] approach god like that
[33:42] hallelujah one thing they acknowledged
[33:44] lord if you had been here
[33:46] my brother would not have died see what
[33:49] i'm saying
[33:50] when you approach god you can't approach
[33:52] god like he's some man
[33:54] you got to approach him like he's god
[33:57] you understand with reverence and
[33:58] respect
[34:00] he don't owe us anything don't even
[34:03] un he doesn't owe us a reason why he
[34:05] allowed things to happen
[34:07] but let me hurry up because i've got
[34:09] another quote to back that up but anyhow
[34:14] we understand that nothing
[34:17] could have taken ruth's place
[34:21] and i want to say this there's two women
[34:23] only two
[34:25] ruth and esther and the whole old
[34:29] testament
[34:30] revolves around that book those two
[34:33] books did you know that
[34:35] even the new testament because it shows
[34:39] our redemption through those two books
[34:42] it shows how god took a gentile bride
[34:47] through those books i mean we can go by
[34:50] by world
[34:50] uh uh perspective but let's
[34:54] just look at what god has done there for
[34:56] us
[34:58] look what he did for us and we was
[35:02] all mixed up among idolaters and
[35:05] you name it that's what we were but
[35:08] nobody could have taken the place of
[35:10] ruth
[35:11] and this is what i want to say to you if
[35:14] there's two characters
[35:16] in this book you should relate to
[35:19] it should be ruth and esther
[35:24] in those two books it opens up
[35:28] where you are who you are and where
[35:32] you're going
[35:33] and even the position that you're going
[35:35] to have at the end
[35:37] why because those books were
[35:40] written with you in mind
[35:44] that's just the anti that's just a type
[35:46] we're the real deal
[35:48] hallelujah and the word cannot fail
[35:52] neither can it falter hallelujah
[35:55] but understand in order to meet boaz
[36:00] you've got to have character and in
[36:03] order
[36:04] for you to become the the king uh uh
[36:07] wife of the of the king ahasuras
[36:11] you've got to have character
[36:14] so god is working on your character
[36:17] so that when you do meet the king he
[36:20] will accept you
[36:23] hallelujah now you say what do you mean
[36:25] brother well let's put it this way
[36:28] we are accepted in the beloved
[36:32] but that doesn't come by mind that come
[36:35] by experience
[36:37] y'all hear what i'm saying it comes by
[36:40] experience
[36:41] we are fighters
[36:45] excuse me my mouth is so dry
[36:51] we are fighters
[36:54] are you a fighter god put you in an age
[36:57] if you don't fight you in trouble
[37:00] you got to fight to stay alive you have
[37:02] to fight to stay in the anointing
[37:06] it's a constant every day
[37:09] hallelujah i love that i love it because
[37:12] you got to empty out every day so god
[37:15] can refill you every day
[37:17] it's true because we're in grace doesn't
[37:20] mean that you don't confess
[37:24] you're wrong no you confess you're wrong
[37:28] that's the word but god has already
[37:30] forgiven you
[37:32] oh come on somebody we have such an
[37:34] unconditional covenant
[37:36] god is stamped you never did it in the
[37:39] first place
[37:42] but you got to believe it first timothy
[37:45] 6
[37:45] 11-12 let me hurry
[37:50] ah i'm so far behind
[37:53] first timothy 6 11-12 but thou o man
[37:59] of god flee these things and follow out
[38:03] the righteousness
[38:04] godliness faith love patience
[38:08] meekness fight the good fight of faith
[38:11] not paul is saying
[38:13] follow after these things but you're
[38:15] going to have a fight
[38:16] fight the good fight of faith lay a hold
[38:20] on eternal life sound like paul is
[38:23] understand what wrestling is all about
[38:26] jacob lay ahead
[38:27] lay the hole of the angel and he
[38:30] wrassled and let me tell you know what
[38:33] wrestling is
[38:34] you get victory you're on top after a
[38:36] while
[38:37] you're on the bottom you're on the side
[38:39] you're on the top
[38:41] you're on the bottom it's back and forth
[38:43] back and forth
[38:44] and finally your opponent
[38:47] gives out and you become victor
[38:51] you see what i'm saying it it and that
[38:54] angel
[38:55] that angel that that that he wrestled
[38:57] with
[38:58] and you got to understand we're talking
[39:00] about self
[39:05] you're the one that needs to die
[39:08] and god is there to change you
[39:11] but not only die we've got a rod and
[39:14] none of us don't know how to die nor rod
[39:16] so it becomes a wrestling it becomes a
[39:19] match
[39:20] am i going to let him live or i'm going
[39:23] to let the one that's in me live
[39:26] hallelujah the one who's calling me he's
[39:29] got to live
[39:30] at the end of this he must come out as a
[39:33] victor
[39:34] let me let me hurry up now fight the
[39:36] good fight of faith lay a hold of
[39:38] eternal life
[39:39] where unto thou art also called
[39:42] and has professed a good profession
[39:46] before many witnesses you know what that
[39:47] means confession and profession
[39:49] when you like brotherhood said you
[39:52] confess a profess
[39:53] a christian you're going to be judged as
[39:56] a christian
[39:59] so let your profession and your
[40:00] confession
[40:02] be true hallelujah
[40:05] oh my commission is a message he brought
[40:07] in 51
[40:08] he said won't it be wonderful to feel
[40:11] his
[40:12] arms around you and say now don't cry
[40:16] enter into the joys of the lord you
[40:19] fought
[40:19] a good fight so while we're here
[40:23] and got his this opportunity let's
[40:26] make a good fight a real fight
[40:30] hallelujah is that all right i've never
[40:33] been
[40:34] fond of boxing and fighting on the tv or
[40:37] that kind of a thing
[40:41] but you know when you've been in a fight
[40:42] and you walk out
[40:44] walk out as a victor you feel pretty
[40:47] good
[40:48] you might be in the pain but you know
[40:49] you're whooping
[40:52] you know yeah you know it's that kind of
[40:55] thing
[40:55] and paul said hey be a good fighter
[40:59] fight the good fight of faith
[41:03] don't ever let anybody make you believe
[41:06] that jesus christ has changed
[41:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[41:12] forever
[41:13] and he's doing everything he's always
[41:15] done
[41:17] but without faith is impossible to
[41:19] please him
[41:21] hallelujah second timothy 4 6-7 i'm
[41:23] picking it up a little bit
[41:26] starting at the sixth verse he says for
[41:28] i am not ready to be offered
[41:31] and the time of my departure is at hand
[41:34] i have fought a good fight i have
[41:37] finished my course
[41:38] i have kept the faith that that in
[41:41] itself
[41:43] you know paul wasn't trying to brag
[41:46] but paul had confidence that he's done
[41:49] all that god
[41:50] wants him to do you understand me
[41:53] see that's what i'm saying i don't want
[41:55] to die until i've done
[41:57] all god wants me to do whatever it may
[42:00] be it may be small it may be big
[42:02] but whatever i want to have that
[42:05] confidence
[42:06] that the devil didn't hinder me and
[42:09] and and though he hindered me at times i
[42:11] still accomplished my purpose
[42:14] you and i have a purpose here whatever
[42:16] that purpose is you want to finish
[42:18] it
[42:22] you look at elsa and i'm jumping a
[42:23] little bit but don't you understand
[42:26] that esther israel could not been
[42:28] completed without her
[42:31] that's why the word of god says listen
[42:33] you know they
[42:34] they was before us they cannot be
[42:37] completed without us
[42:40] we are the capping if you want to put it
[42:42] that way we are the queen of heaven
[42:44] we are the ones amen that fully
[42:47] how can i say it because of the
[42:49] embodiment of christ in us
[42:52] the bride of jesus christ when we take
[42:54] our position
[42:55] the rapture takes place
[42:58] see but we've got to we've got to make
[43:00] sure we take our position
[43:02] it's in the bible it's right there in
[43:04] the book of esther
[43:06] i'm coming to that in just a moment just
[43:08] to taste just a little bit by god's
[43:10] grace i have fought a good fight i've
[43:11] finished my course
[43:12] i have kept the faith his fourth day is
[43:16] laid up for me
[43:17] a crown of righteousness which the lord
[43:20] the righteous judge
[43:21] shall give me at that day and
[43:25] this is the part i like not to me only
[43:29] but unto all them also that love
[43:33] his appearing
[43:36] and what people don't understand is that
[43:39] the appearing and the coming is two
[43:40] different things
[43:43] his appearing was when william branham
[43:44] was here
[43:46] his appearing is now in the bride
[43:50] showing he's the same yesterday today
[43:52] and forever
[43:54] hallelujah and if you love his
[43:56] appearance that means you're eating that
[43:58] word you're studying that word
[44:00] you're living that word so that people
[44:03] can
[44:03] see him not you see him
[44:09] that's what it was about brother says
[44:11] it's not me
[44:12] it's him what you see is him
[44:16] he's the healer i'm not a divine healer
[44:19] there's no such thing
[44:21] if i could be a divine healer that makes
[44:23] me a divine savior
[44:24] it's impossible there's only one savior
[44:28] there's only one divine healer and it's
[44:30] our duty and purpose
[44:32] to make sure the world see
[44:36] that he's alive and well
[44:39] god can't judge a man for nothing he's
[44:41] never seen
[44:43] people need to see jesus did you know
[44:45] that's what happened to israel
[44:48] that's why god she was a vast guy too
[44:50] and when god called for her to
[44:52] to uh to see the unfolding of the word
[44:54] it meant she rejected and crucified him
[44:57] this same generation cut the generation
[44:59] coming out day we did the same thing in
[45:00] the pentecostal world and i'm jumping
[45:03] we've done the same thing i say we they
[45:05] did
[45:06] right listen brother said it
[45:09] seems like the christian life if
[45:12] the fellow is not absolutely centered on
[45:15] christ
[45:16] the christian life seems like hold so
[45:19] many disappointments
[45:21] but those disappointments are god's
[45:24] divine will

[49:22] that right
[49:23] that's what i'm trying to tell everybody
[49:25] i'm trying to tell everybody let's go
[49:26] forward
[49:27] let's not just stay here let's go
[49:30] forward
[49:31] we can't read how can i say it you can't
[49:34] to
[49:35] bring back the past
[49:38] you know the church ages amen what they
[49:40] did in pentecost and all that
[49:42] that was good but god got something even
[49:44] greater
[49:45] but you'll never know what the greater
[49:47] is until you go forward
[49:51] so you say well how could it be great
[49:53] it's greater the promised land was far
[49:56] greater
[49:56] amen than egypt in egypt they were in
[49:59] bondage
[50:00] in the promised land they were free they
[50:02] had to fight giants
[50:04] but at least they could fight back you
[50:07] couldn't even fight back in egypt
[50:08] if you fought back you were killed
[50:11] hallelujah but unless amen they could
[50:13] fight
[50:14] back and as long as they stayed with the
[50:17] word
[50:17] god gave them victory out the victory
[50:19] after victory after victory
[50:21] it was only when they got off the word
[50:23] they began to fail
[50:28] hallelujah you like
[50:31] you love the lord
[50:35] call to do what sin in the stone you
[50:36] can't you cannot take this lightly
[50:40] most of us don't even know what it means
[50:42] to to even repeat that scripture
[50:44] because we haven't meditated on it we
[50:46] never thought we don't think about
[50:48] what he's asking us to do and do you
[50:50] think
[50:51] that in this condition that we're in
[50:53] that that's going to happen
[50:55] absolutely not there must be changes
[50:58] made
[50:59] in all of us hallelujah
[51:02] he's calling for a perfect bride and
[51:04] that's what he's going to get
[51:06] can you give me a few more minutes i
[51:08] said i was going to cut short
[51:10] at least some of y'all alive tonight to
[51:12] say amen
[51:15] you're saying it in your heart or your
[51:17] head or something
[51:20] i'm going to close on this scripture and
[51:22] i'll pick it up
[51:23] next service won't be sunday because i'm
[51:26] down there
[51:27] in iowa city
[51:35] esther the second chapter in the seventh
[51:48] verse
[52:08] the bible said and he brought up
[52:10] hadassah
[52:11] that is esther his uncle's daughter
[52:16] for she had neither father
[52:20] nor mother that the maid was fair and
[52:24] beautiful
[52:25] whom mordecai when her father and mother
[52:29] were dead
[52:31] took for his own
[52:34] daughter and i'm gonna stop there
[52:36] because that phrase
[52:41] is a type
[52:45] having no father a mother he didn't have
[52:47] to say that
[52:48] but he placed it in there so that you
[52:50] could see that there was something
[52:53] a mystery hid within that passage of
[52:55] scripture
[52:58] because there's only one that i know in
[53:00] the spiritual realm
[53:01] that had no mother or father
[53:05] that was melchizedek
[53:08] and that was elohim
[53:11] and here he's bringing out some because
[53:13] see god can't join you to something
[53:15] that's unequal
[53:17] he can't join himself to something
[53:18] that's not equal
[53:22] it's like the chinese laundry ticket
[53:26] as the prophet of god explained it to us
[53:30] one ticket torn in half
[53:34] see you got to understand amen a lot of
[53:37] these things and listen
[53:39] if the word is opened which it is
[53:43] brother brown said i'm just laying down
[53:44] the basics
[53:46] but i have ministers who will be able to
[53:49] come and bring it to a
[53:51] another level enlightened you
[53:54] he didn't say they're changing because
[53:55] it stays right within the word
[53:58] but i they'll be there they ordained
[54:01] and i'll explain that to you maybe the
[54:03] next service what that is
[54:05] because you got to understand if you
[54:08] just
[54:10] brother said god don't need parrots
[54:15] you know what he meant by that so you
[54:18] understand
[54:20] bird the parrot bird he don't need
[54:23] nobody to repeat
[54:24] it oh just repeat it and see when
[54:26] brother
[54:27] said say say it just like i said it
[54:30] so i'm gonna ask you a question
[54:33] did brother branham quote everything
[54:35] brother paul
[54:37] said
[54:42] he did what paul said he brought the
[54:43] revelation of what paul
[54:45] preached but you'll never see him
[54:48] quoting every scripture going down
[54:50] this is what paul said you understand me
[54:53] it was a revelation
[54:55] you if you if you take it and you bring
[54:57] it intellectually you
[54:59] miss what god does what he do
[55:02] he works by inspiration he works by
[55:05] revelation
[55:07] and if we can't go in this bible with
[55:09] the very stories that brother branham
[55:11] has
[55:12] laid out before us and then find things
[55:14] that
[55:15] he didn't have time to bring out
[55:18] but it's still the word
[55:21] it's not a adding neither is it taken
[55:23] away
[55:26] if the book is not open to you
[55:29] because that's what brings people to
[55:31] fear that's why what has made the
[55:32] nominations in organizations right now
[55:34] in the message
[55:36] because men men are afraid
[55:39] to meet the king
[55:43] they told they told esther that too if
[55:46] you go in
[55:46] meet the king without him summoning you
[55:49] you're going to get killed
[55:50] he gonna kill you if you go to the
[55:54] king's chamber
[55:58] which types out the holy of holies if
[55:59] you go back there
[56:01] if you go there you're gonna die
[56:04] especially if he didn't summons you
[56:06] you know what she said and here's a
[56:08] mystery i'm gonna fast three days
[56:12] at night without food or water
[56:18] and i'm going to see the king
[56:23] you got to understand that esther
[56:25] started out
[56:26] with a wine the whole book started out
[56:29] with a
[56:30] feast what feast
[56:33] there's only been really one feast and
[56:35] that was the opening of the word
[56:38] and everybody was invited to it
[56:40] worldwide it was
[56:42] invited
[56:44] said amen let this go
[56:47] out invitation go out through all of the
[56:49] kingdom which was the type of the whole
[56:51] world
[56:53] let's find a bride for the king
[56:57] you all hear what i'm saying what was it
[57:01] and mordecai had already worked on
[57:03] esther he he
[57:04] you know and i think mordecai means
[57:07] little one
[57:08] and that's what brother branham was he
[57:10] was a little one he wasn't a big
[57:12] one he was a little fella showed the
[57:14] statue as well
[57:16] but he wasn't one of these great
[57:17] preachers that got all his recognition
[57:20] you would have missed him
[57:22] many missed him hallelujah but he was
[57:25] the one working
[57:26] on the bride he told the bride who was
[57:29] esther
[57:29] he said i'm going to tell you what the
[57:31] king likes
[57:34] hallelujah i'm going to let you know
[57:36] what he's like
[57:37] hallelujah and i'm going to give you a
[57:39] robe i'm going to give you a a
[57:41] gown whatever a garment it meant to wear
[57:44] and
[57:44] this is what he likes what was it
[57:48] she didn't dress herself like the
[57:49] worldly woman
[57:53] she dressed herself simple
[57:56] she wore it just like he told her to
[57:58] wear it
[58:00] and when the king saw the character that
[58:03] flowed from her the bible says
[58:06] he loved her and chose her to be queen
[58:11] now i'm gonna stop right there and by
[58:15] god's grace we've got a lot
[58:18] uh uh a lot to share
[58:24] but by god's grace i trust that we
[58:27] if you don't if you don't stop with this
[58:30] intellectual
[58:32] way of thinking
[58:35] it's not because you haven't heard it
[58:37] before some things you may have and some
[58:39] things you may not
[58:40] but the bible says you haven't passed
[58:41] this way before
[58:44] but as long as it's preached and you can
[58:46] find it
[58:48] in the word it is the word
[58:51] amen we're not we're i had a brother
[58:54] correct me he says well
[58:55] you know brother didn't say that the
[58:57] seven church age was over
[59:00] but let me in in in
[59:03] 1956 he preached indictment
[59:09] in revelation uh uh or the third chapter
[59:12] he was put out of the church so what can
[59:15] a church
[59:16] be but over if jesus christ is out
[59:22] huh then where is he
[59:27] he's in the bride of jesus
[59:30] everyone that opened that door to him he
[59:34] said i will come
[59:35] into you not into you
[59:38] and suck with you i will break the bread
[59:42] the revelation open to you if you open
[59:46] the door to me
[59:49] that's where we are it's going home
[59:53] time and we're still fussing and
[59:55] fighting over doctrinal things if we
[1:00:00] understood grace
[1:00:02] our doctrines won't mean a thing because
[1:00:05] brother bradley said when that pressure
[1:00:06] comes
[1:00:08] and these christians began to get
[1:00:10] persecuted
[1:00:11] he said you're going to be so happy to
[1:00:13] see a real believer
[1:00:15] he said you in other words he said you
[1:00:17] won't ever have you want to ask him what
[1:00:18] doctrine you believe
[1:00:21] huh that's not going to if it didn't if
[1:00:23] it don't matter it won't matter then it
[1:00:24] doesn't matter now
[1:00:26] brother brown said god gives all of us
[1:00:29] the holy ghost with our peculiarities
[1:00:32] amen people say oh well you know if they
[1:00:35] ain't baptized in the name of lord jesus
[1:00:36] christ i don't heard so much stuff
[1:00:38] i don't heard so much people doctrinal
[1:00:40] things you don't know
[1:00:42] election will bring the truth to every
[1:00:44] believer
[1:00:46] real believer whether they're part of
[1:00:48] this or part of something else
[1:00:49] god will bring it right when elijah
[1:00:53] thought
[1:00:54] i'm the only one left god said uh-uh
[1:00:57] there's 7 000 that hasn't bowed
[1:01:01] that needs to bail and i don't think
[1:01:03] elijah knew who those 7 000 were
[1:01:06] uh you know we so we we're crippled in
[1:01:10] our minds and you know what
[1:01:11] as long as we continue to judge as long
[1:01:13] as we continue to be the way we
[1:01:15] are you'll never reach perfection
[1:01:18] your level of thinking must come up
[1:01:20] higher you must let the mind of christ
[1:01:23] be in you
[1:01:24] and if you find out through the
[1:01:26] scriptures when jesus was called to go
[1:01:27] somewhere
[1:01:28] he didn't care whether they were purple
[1:01:29] yellow blue or black
[1:01:31] he went even to the to to legion he
[1:01:35] didn't care what other people think
[1:01:36] thought about him he did what the father
[1:01:39] commanded him to do
[1:01:42] and well we we you know we so what we've
[1:01:44] done to this message is not right
[1:01:47] and i don't care if i'm considered a
[1:01:49] rebel i guess i am because
[1:01:51] some of the stuff that our people want
[1:01:52] to believe ain't true
[1:01:59] he whom the son is set free is free
[1:02:00] indeed
[1:02:02] and i got a word that holds me
[1:02:06] i don't hold a word the word holds me
[1:02:12] glory to god there's a word called
[1:02:14] esther is it there
[1:02:16] ruth is in there hallelujah
[1:02:20] and garden already told me my story
[1:02:23] i know what my energy somebody help me
[1:02:26] here
[1:02:27] so you say what do you mean let me tell
[1:02:28] you something even if i'm still on my
[1:02:30] journey
[1:02:31] i know my destiny you love the lord
[1:02:46] amen
