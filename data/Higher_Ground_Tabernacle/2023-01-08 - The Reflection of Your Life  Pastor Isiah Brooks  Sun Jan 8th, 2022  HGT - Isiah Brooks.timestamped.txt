[50:48] uh we're gonna answer to turn with us to
[50:51] Joshua
[50:52] the Book of Joshua and we're going to
[50:56] read from uh the 24th chapter
[51:02] from 13th verse to the 28th verse
[51:08] Adventures
[51:13] foreign
[51:45] and ye dwell in them
[51:48] of the vineyard and of the olive yards
[51:51] which he planted not do you eating it is
[51:58] now therefore fear the lord
[52:00] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[52:04] itself
[52:06] put away the gods which your father
[52:10] served on the other side of the flood
[52:12] but despite college
[52:15] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[52:20] and if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[52:24] the Lord
[52:26] choose you this day whom you will served
[52:31] whether the gods which your father
[52:33] served that were on the other side of
[52:36] the
[52:38] floods
[52:40] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[52:44] land ye dwell
[52:47] but as for me in my house
[52:51] we will serve the laws
[52:54] and the people answered and said foreign
[52:59] God forbid that we should forsake the
[53:02] Lord to serve other gods what do you do
[53:04] that
[53:06] for the Lord Our God he
[53:09] he it is that brought us up out of the
[53:12] father
[53:13] of our fathers out of the land of
[53:16] Egyptians
[53:19] from the house of bondage
[53:22] which did those great signs in our sight
[53:25] and preserved Us
[53:32] in all the ways where when we went and
[53:35] among all the people through whom we
[53:37] passed
[53:42] and the Lord drain out before us all the
[53:46] people even the amorites would dwell in
[53:49] the land
[53:53] therefore will we also serve the Lord
[53:56] for he is our God news will see himself
[54:02] and Joshua said unto the people
[54:05] ye cannot serve the Lord for he is a
[54:09] holy God
[54:13] and he is a jealous God
[54:16] he will not forgive your transgressions
[54:22] for if he forsake the Lord
[54:28] will he turn and do you hurt
[54:35] after that he have done good together
[54:38] and the people said unto Joshua
[54:42] no but
[54:49] ye are witnesses against yourself
[54:53] that you have chosen you you have chosen
[54:57] you the Lord you're sick you exam
[55:00] serve him pull yourself here and they
[55:03] said

[55:12] which are among you I don't know please
[55:27] and his voice we will obey
[55:32] that part again
[55:41] Joshua made a covenant with the people
[55:52] as he shared and Joshua wrote these
[55:56] words in the book of The Law of God he
[55:58] said
[55:59] and took a great Stone
[56:03] Pierre and set it up under and oh
[56:08] by the sanctuary of the Lord
[56:10] [Music]
[56:12] said unto all the people

[56:20] for it has heard all the words of the
[56:24] Lord

[56:32] there for a witness unto you
[56:36] lest ye denied God your God I think of
[56:40] him

[56:51] one more scripture same chapter John uh
[56:54] Joshua 24. you know we'll read the 31st
[56:58] verse
[57:00] and Israel served the Lord all the days
[57:03] of Joshua
[57:06] all the days of the elders that over
[57:09] lived Joshua
[57:12] which had known all the works of the
[57:15] Lord

[57:40] we thank you Father God for your grace
[57:44] and mercy I pray that you will speak to
[57:47] our hearts
[57:48] as we move completely out of your ways

[58:00] that's right
[58:15] God is good to us
[58:18] and I trust by God's grace that the word
[58:20] of God will be a blessing to you this
[58:22] morning
[58:25] I have to start off this way comes out
[58:29] when God brought us the message
[58:33] it was not given to us
[58:37] just to memorize just poor memories
[58:41] it was given to us
[58:44] to take us into a higher order of life

[59:08] that uh Babylon Babylon has been
[59:12] defeated
[59:13] and those of you who weren't here on
[59:16] Wednesdays
[59:19] I made a statement
[59:22] in the statement
[59:28] is the greatest deception
[59:31] deception to a Christian
[59:35] I'm gonna say it again
[59:37] Christianity
[59:38] is the greatest deception
[59:42] you're a Christian
[59:45] because there are so many people
[59:48] who claim to be Christians
[59:51] among the group of Christians
[59:55] but even as all Israel

[1:00:08] Hallelujah now we have been given a
[1:00:12] prophet
[1:00:14] and we know that brother random is the
[1:00:16] prophet of our age

[1:00:32] understanding during that time
[1:00:55] just like
[1:00:57] talking to the children of Israel
[1:01:00] Joshua became the leader
[1:01:03] God said to the people you have never
[1:01:08] traveled this way before
[1:01:12] so if you haven't traveled
[1:01:18] things will not look so familiar to you
[1:01:22] Hallelujah is that all right so you and
[1:01:26] I must understand what dude we haven't
[1:01:29] gone this way before
[1:01:32] we must be a new way
[1:01:37] Hallelujah now God spoke to Joshua
[1:01:42] and began to tell the children of Israel
[1:01:46] all that God had done for them
[1:01:49] hallelujah hallelujah how God defeated

[1:02:17] you this land

[1:08:16] of God
[1:08:19] the open book live over
[1:08:22] that word that's now open
[1:08:26] gives us access to the entire Bible
[1:08:30] and all of his promises
[1:08:34] Hallelujah is that all right see the
[1:08:38] Seed of Abraham
[1:08:40] God said from the dust to the Stars
[1:08:47] will bow before you
[1:08:50] maybe I'm Obsession here this morning
[1:08:54] I said maybe I'm insane here this
[1:08:56] morning but I feel good if nobody else
[1:08:59] makes you feel good
[1:09:01] Hallelujah why because I recognize this
[1:09:05] morning
[1:09:07] that what God has done for me
[1:09:10] no man can take it from me
[1:09:14] Hallelujah and what God is doing for me
[1:09:19] I know that God can do it for you
[1:09:23] but you know baby a lot of us don't even
[1:09:27] love the word
[1:09:30] you don't read you don't study you don't
[1:09:34] pray and how can you love the word
[1:09:39] and I can't make you love the words
[1:09:43] but so many of us have been so
[1:09:46] programmed
[1:09:48] when you get a preacher like me you
[1:09:52] don't know how to handle it
[1:09:54] because I'm not going to be theatrical
[1:09:56] for you I'm not going to be theatrical
[1:09:59] for you
[1:10:00] I'm not going to do the Hollywood drama
[1:10:05] hallelujah amen yes I know how to do it
[1:10:09] I can get you stirred up what I want to
[1:10:13] eat want you to hear this morning is the
[1:10:16] word of God
[1:10:18] Amen Hallelujah I guarantee you I forgot
[1:10:22] the music in here right y'all be shaking
[1:10:26] Hallelujah the music don't save you but
[1:10:29] that music
[1:10:30] Hallelujah prayer don't even save you
[1:10:33] only faith in God
[1:10:37] hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says at
[1:10:41] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] every Niche about
[1:10:48] Jesus Christ
[1:10:52] let me say it like this
[1:10:56] we don't even that's for this way how
[1:10:59] can I say it without not trying to down
[1:11:01] you but oh should you say but how many
[1:11:04] of you know
[1:11:06] that your name has been changed
[1:11:13] how many you really know
[1:11:15] that your name
[1:11:19] hallelujah hallelujah now the prophet of
[1:11:22] God came and all the prophet to do one
[1:11:25] thing and that was to prepare us for a
[1:11:28] Rapture
[1:11:30] but brother Brandon couldn't prepare us
[1:11:33] for a rap yeah
[1:11:39] and then when the seals were broken he
[1:11:42] began
[1:11:44] in a way that he's never seen him before
[1:11:47] now watch this because even Paul said
[1:11:52] but there is a mystery that God held uh
[1:11:57] uh hid from the world
[1:11:59] Hallelujah until the end times
[1:12:03] what is this mystery
[1:12:10] ah I look at it and I I think to myself
[1:12:14] I wish I could really cause a Revival in
[1:12:17] you but I don't know how come on
[1:12:22] God has to bring the Revival
[1:12:26] and you've got to want the Revival
[1:12:28] Hallelujah
[1:12:31] because you got to realize by the grace
[1:12:33] of God
[1:12:35] one thing because you're super new and
[1:12:38] that is to make sure that the words that
[1:12:40] I preach
[1:12:42] will allow you to grow in the grace of
[1:12:46] God
[1:12:47] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:12:51] what good will it do us
[1:12:56] to say we are a dove
[1:13:01] and we're not it is but we've got all
[1:13:06] these dub feathers
[1:13:08] stuck all in us
[1:13:10] we're acting like a dove the best we
[1:13:14] know how
[1:13:15] but no matter how you try to act that
[1:13:18] way come here come here hallelujah
[1:13:21] nature will betray you what connects
[1:13:25] y'all better hear what I'm saying I
[1:13:28] don't care how much we jump
[1:13:34] before we got here
[1:13:39] don't care about how many minutes you
[1:13:41] got
[1:13:43] this interested in one thing and that is
[1:13:46] seeing his image
[1:13:50] he's come to see his image
[1:13:53] and how will do we get there
[1:13:56] I'm gonna ask you a question
[1:13:59] how many of you have listened to the
[1:14:01] message
[1:14:03] the statue of a perfect man
[1:14:06] really listen to it
[1:14:09] let me tell you something
[1:14:11] that is a message you must listen
[1:14:15] if you want to make a Rapture
[1:14:18] that is a message that you must listen
[1:14:23] did
[1:14:57] Hallelujah
[1:15:08] they had characters
[1:15:13] I'm gonna show you something this
[1:15:14] morning I hope you can see it
[1:15:19] christer hidden by his nature
[1:15:27] people say I know Jesus
[1:15:30] but you don't know him
[1:15:33] if you don't know his nature
[1:15:38] and
[1:16:02] a Christian
[1:16:04] is known by its nature
[1:16:08] hallelujah hallelujah it ain't about all
[1:16:11] that you wear
[1:16:12] even though that's a part of it
[1:16:15] Hallelujah but who's gonna outdress the
[1:16:19] Muslim
[1:16:21] but because they dress like that don't
[1:16:23] make them Christmas
[1:16:26] hello somebody
[1:16:29] hello somebody
[1:16:31] hello
[1:16:35] yeah just say it just say it
[1:16:38] what we're looking at and this is where
[1:16:40] I'm going with this because
[1:16:42] I want to see Jesus
[1:16:45] he said in that day you know I'm in the
[1:16:48] Father the fathers and yeah
[1:16:50] I want to see Jesus do you understand
[1:16:53] what I'm saying you understand what I'm
[1:16:55] saying
[1:16:58] hallelujah hallelujah and the only way
[1:17:02] we're going to see him there's a certain
[1:17:04] way is that we must die to ourselves
[1:17:08] one of the quotes that preachers have
[1:17:11] quoted
[1:17:12] even myself
[1:17:14] where brother Brandon said you have been
[1:17:17] Justified
[1:17:18] as though you've never sinned in the
[1:17:21] first place
[1:17:22] you know that don't apply to you if you
[1:17:26] don't have the Holy ghosts
[1:17:32] don't even apply to yourself amen
[1:17:40] but
[1:17:42] hallelujah hallelujah and when you get
[1:17:44] the Holy Ghost it's not you accepting
[1:17:47] God is God accepting you who's accepted
[1:17:54] y'all hear what I'm saying this is not
[1:17:57] an hour
[1:17:58] that we should wonder whether we have it
[1:18:01] or not the Bible said make your calling
[1:18:05] any lessons
[1:18:10] my message this morning
[1:18:14] the reflection of your life
[1:18:18] amen you know Israel said
[1:18:22] we're going to serve God
[1:18:26] we'll serve God
[1:18:28] and Joshua which is the type of the Holy
[1:18:32] Ghost
[1:18:33] said but no you will not I I think no
[1:18:38] you will not
[1:18:40] he was literally bringing them to a
[1:18:43] challenge
[1:18:49] Hallelujah and Joshua say no you will
[1:18:52] not
[1:18:53] know Hallelujah
[1:18:55] is that right it's kind of what Jesus
[1:18:58] did to the disciples the security says
[1:19:01] you have to feel discipline he said
[1:19:03] except you eat my flesh you know I do
[1:19:04] and drink my blood you have no part in
[1:19:08] here hallelujah and that Gallant Man by
[1:19:12] the name of Peter they said don't you
[1:19:14] know the people when Christ said will
[1:19:15] you go too because he said oh Lord where
[1:19:19] can I go
[1:19:21] the only one who has the words to
[1:19:23] eternal life
[1:19:25] if you need this message
[1:19:32] there was only one in our days
[1:19:46] amen William Brown I'm calling him
[1:19:49] but God gave him the words
[1:19:55] amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:20:00] and we can sit back
[1:20:03] and praise the Lord
[1:20:06] and say well yes God's still a prophet
[1:20:10] but there were millions in the days of
[1:20:13] Moses
[1:20:18] and Jesus said that everyone dead he's
[1:20:22] so too small
[1:20:48] sometimes I say things uh concerning
[1:20:51] brother Branham and a lot of people
[1:20:53] think that I'm against brother Brown
[1:20:56] kidding me
[1:20:57] foreign
[1:21:45] you know I'm not here to be popular
[1:21:48] they have no idea what my life consists
[1:21:52] of is
[1:21:54] whether you think I can preach or not I
[1:21:56] could have had a mega church
[1:21:59] but I could have never had a mega church
[1:22:01] preaching the truth
[1:22:06] give me soda crackers and Branch water
[1:22:09] don't worry
[1:22:11] y'all hear what I'm saying but I'ma say
[1:22:14] it like this to you this morning
[1:22:17] not one of you'll be able to stand
[1:22:21] before God

[1:23:11] male and female created he's them
[1:23:15] and bless them
[1:23:17] and call their name Adam

[1:23:31] son in his own likeness
[1:23:35] after his image
[1:23:38] and called his name Seth and we do not
[1:23:41] renowned the set hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:43] now holy God hello I'm sorry no no just
[1:23:48] let me stop there I was blending
[1:23:49] something there but what was it
[1:23:51] if you notice there see
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:43] we've got to Humble ourselves
[1:24:47] Thomas the statue of a perfect man how
[1:24:50] long do that statue that is the divine
[1:24:52] nature of God
[1:24:54] that is where Christ hid himself
[1:24:58] yeah you'll see what I'm talking about
[1:25:01] in just a minute but people are looking
[1:25:03] for Jesus and they don't understand he's
[1:25:06] in his nature
[1:25:09] and wherever his nature is that's where
[1:25:13] Jesus is
[1:25:17] hiding himself from the world and they
[1:25:20] can't see it he's even hiding himself
[1:25:24] from believer called themselves to walk
[1:25:28] according to the message
[1:25:35] that followed Joshua yeah
[1:25:38] we're not believers
[1:25:43] because even after they crossed over
[1:25:45] Jordans
[1:25:48] showed his colors
[1:25:52] hallelujah hallelujah what happened
[1:25:54] because if I still connected to Babylon
[1:25:59] Hallelujah and as long as you still
[1:26:02] connected to Babylon you're gonna always
[1:26:05] have those Spirits pulling on you
[1:26:08] Hallelujah
[1:26:11] let me move on see we got to die and rot
[1:26:15] to ourselves
[1:26:16] a lot of us we don't want to do that but
[1:26:20] those Christianity is a narrow way
[1:26:26] the narrow way y'all hear what I'm
[1:26:29] saying most people don't want the narrow
[1:26:32] way
[1:26:33] because they can't just do what they
[1:26:36] want to do
[1:26:37] but Paul says I'm a prisoner of Christ
[1:26:40] and you must become a prisoner of Christ
[1:26:43] in order to follow Christ all the way to
[1:26:46] Calvary
[1:26:48] now but no in the message
[1:26:52] brother Ron tells us here
[1:26:55] holy God
[1:26:57] could not condone sins
[1:27:02] so nothing could touch the mountain
[1:27:04] where God was
[1:27:06] talking about Mount Sinai weather
[1:27:12] then God was made flesh
[1:27:15] and dwelt Among Us
[1:27:18] in the form of Jesus Christ
[1:27:22] his creation
[1:27:24] then that son I don't surface gave his
[1:27:28] life and the blood cell of God was
[1:27:31] broken
[1:27:37] that the life might come out of the
[1:27:41] blood
[1:27:44] I knew y'all understand
[1:27:47] it was given to us
[1:27:51] hallelujah hallelujah listen it's so sad
[1:27:54] it's just so sad I see too much
[1:27:58] Christianity
[1:28:11] but I want you to look and see who you
[1:28:13] are
[1:28:16] don't let the devil deceive me
[1:28:23] you don't get a second chance with this
[1:28:28] can you imagine
[1:28:30] the Rapture
[1:28:33] knowing this message
[1:28:35] and yeah you miss it
[1:28:40] huh
[1:28:41] that's possible Paul said you can
[1:28:45] understand all Mysteries
[1:28:48] give a prophecy
[1:28:51] mountains give all your goods to feed
[1:28:55] the poems even allow yourself to be
[1:28:58] burned for sacrifice
[1:29:03] somebody help me here this morning
[1:29:05] because it's nothing but the truth but
[1:29:09] we're very seldom think about charity
[1:29:14] very seldom think about charity
[1:29:19] charity is something that you must have
[1:29:23] in order to make a rapture
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] and I'm not talking about this this uh
[1:29:33] filial love is
[1:29:35] I'm talking about Agape
[1:29:40] hallelujah hallelujah listen
[1:29:44] St John 4 24 24.
[1:29:47] the Bible says
[1:29:50] God is a spirit
[1:29:53] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:29:57] Him
[1:30:01] hey let me say it like this how many you
[1:30:05] of you know that you got the spirit
[1:30:09] how many do you how many no you have the
[1:30:14] Holy Ghost
[1:30:16] well if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:30:18] right now your worship is in vain amen
[1:30:27] am I trying to get to your heart I'm
[1:30:29] trying to get yourself
[1:30:32] because it's later than what you think
[1:30:35] hallelujah we're talking about the
[1:30:37] squeeze we don't know what's coming next
[1:30:45] y'all remember the fear
[1:30:47] that covet drop on us
[1:30:51] there's coming something worse
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:55] how are you going to handle the thing
[1:30:58] that's coming
[1:31:00] if you don't grow in God
[1:31:05] haven't taught you anything
[1:31:09] it should have taught you something
[1:31:12] you understand what I'm saying that time
[1:31:16] you should have been examining yourself
[1:31:22] foreign
[1:31:29] [Laughter]
[1:32:02] but then God said to me because they
[1:32:06] love cast out fears
[1:32:11] Hallelujah that's what I gotta have more
[1:32:14] than anything else
[1:32:15] second Corinthians
[1:32:18] 5 17 says
[1:32:21] therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:32:27] he is a new creature
[1:32:29] I I love that not a patched up job
[1:32:35] Hallelujah is that all right all things
[1:32:40] are passed away
[1:32:42] the whole all things have become new
[1:32:47] this is what a real Christian is
[1:32:54] if you're still dipping
[1:32:57] into the old life you used to live
[1:33:02] something is wrong with your experience
[1:33:14] your way into the kingdom of God oh oh
[1:33:18] why owned you
[1:33:19] that ain't gonna make Heaven it's not a
[1:33:22] valley Goose all that bad stuff will not
[1:33:24] make Heaven
[1:33:25] you can say all the grace of God
[1:33:28] but the Bible says no unclean
[1:33:35] and if the blood of Jesus Christ have
[1:33:37] not been applied to your life
[1:33:45] they don't make no difference who you
[1:33:47] are
[1:33:49] I encountered a preacher
[1:33:52] I won't call the country from which he
[1:33:55] was from
[1:33:56] it but this man carried on so bad
[1:34:01] message
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:06] at another brother they were going like
[1:34:09] he was like world war three going on
[1:34:15] so I walked up to the brother
[1:34:18] who was a pastor I thought he was the
[1:34:22] most disrespectful man I had ever met
[1:34:25] claiming to be a man of the cloth you
[1:34:28] guys pictures
[1:34:31] soon as I got a break of course you
[1:34:34] impose I said brother have you ever
[1:34:36] heard of the message
[1:34:40] the statue of a perfect man
[1:34:44] I said but you need to listen to it
[1:34:48] because you ain't got none of the
[1:34:50] virtues
[1:34:54] it stopped him for a moment
[1:34:58] but how can you tell me
[1:35:01] Jesus Christ
[1:35:03] works out of uncontrolled uncontrolled
[1:35:06] Works uncontrollably
[1:35:10] you'll never see him you never saw him
[1:35:13] screaming you've never seen him
[1:35:16] you've never seen him yelling you've
[1:35:19] never seen him out of control
[1:35:26] who do you think we're going to heaven
[1:35:29] with that
[1:35:30] okay let's move on I'm just saying the
[1:35:35] Bible says and you that were sometime
[1:35:37] alienated
[1:35:42] and enemies in your mind by Wicked works
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:55] in the body of his flesh
[1:35:59] to present you
[1:36:02] holy son unblameable
[1:36:06] unreprovable in his sight you talking
[1:36:10] about a perfect man Hallelujah
[1:36:49] Deuteronomy 4. how many of y'all really
[1:36:51] want to make a rap
[1:36:53] and
[1:36:54] I'm going to ask you a question and how
[1:36:57] how many of you really believe you're
[1:36:59] ready
[1:37:03] what makes you think you're ready
[1:37:08] do you bear the divine nature of God in
[1:37:10] you excuse me
[1:37:12] if the divine nature of God is in you
[1:37:15] then you're ready
[1:37:22] it's not talking about being nice and
[1:37:25] goodness
[1:37:28] is that right brother Brandon said
[1:37:31] Christian Science can do outdo all of us
[1:37:33] in that
[1:37:34] hallelujah
[1:37:38] we're not talking about man-made
[1:37:40] righteousness we're talking about the
[1:37:43] righteousness of God
[1:37:45] I feel like you're out in this morning
[1:37:50] one thing I do feel good because a
[1:37:52] couple of days ago
[1:37:54] I was down with the flu so I feel pretty
[1:37:57] good measurements
[1:38:00] I'm just gonna let you know I feel
[1:38:02] pretty good
[1:38:05] take heed unto yourselves
[1:38:08] okay lest she forget the Covenant of the
[1:38:11] Lord your God
[1:38:14] which he made with you
[1:38:17] and made you and and and make you a
[1:38:21] Graven image
[1:38:24] or the likeness of anything
[1:38:31] for the Lord that God is a consuming
[1:38:34] fire
[1:38:36] Hallelujah now I'm gonna say something
[1:38:39] that's going to make somebody mad in
[1:38:41] here
[1:38:45] who is Mary
[1:38:47] to the Catholic Church
[1:38:49] she is a mediator
[1:38:52] and people believe that they can't get
[1:38:55] to God without Mary and the jean-pomsky
[1:38:59] personally and we've done the same thing
[1:39:01] with William Branham
[1:39:06] hey Hallelujah
[1:39:09] right it's the truth tonight we we've
[1:39:14] used him let me I've said this myself
[1:39:16] and the Holy Ghost correcting me
[1:39:19] oh Lord if the prophet of God was here
[1:39:24] and the Lord spoke to my heart and says
[1:39:27] what if he walks I don't literally I
[1:39:29] don't see the prophet he can't do
[1:39:31] nothing without me
[1:39:34] that's right right hello
[1:39:37] you can't do nothing without him
[1:39:43] the branches
[1:39:48] without me so more
[1:39:51] oh you say oh that ain't true it is
[1:39:54] even when Jesus came remember
[1:39:57] those Pharisees were throwing up
[1:40:01] we be Moses disciples
[1:40:06] and then Jesus said don't you even dare
[1:40:10] say that Abraham is of your father
[1:40:13] because before Abraham was God
[1:40:18] hallelujah before Luther was I broke
[1:40:21] down before Wednesday
[1:40:27] I am still gone
[1:40:31] foreign
[1:41:08] hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:41:13] amen he said for the Lord that God is a
[1:41:15] consuming fire
[1:41:17] even a jealous God
[1:41:20] for a long time I thought being jealous
[1:41:22] you know how you're human beings they
[1:41:25] see you with something and they like it
[1:41:27] and they can't get it so they get all
[1:41:28] jealous that ain't the kind of jealousy
[1:41:31] he's talking about
[1:41:34] God it's a fierce fiercely protective
[1:41:40] or Vigilant of one's right or possession
[1:41:44] in other words
[1:41:46] you belong to God
[1:41:49] and he is a protector of his inheritance
[1:41:53] oh come on somebody and you must
[1:41:56] understand
[1:41:57] God is not going to allow you to
[1:42:00] continue to be an adulterer
[1:42:04] idolata that's the word I meant to say
[1:42:07] and idolatized because there's only one
[1:42:10] way to worship God and that is
[1:42:13] Hallelujah
[1:42:19] but many of us
[1:42:21] we're still trying to get to Jesus
[1:42:27] and Christ has already come hey please
[1:42:32] y'all don't got quiet on me yeah
[1:42:38] so I can let me clarify myself
[1:42:41] no way am I telling you
[1:42:44] that you don't listen to this message
[1:42:48] no way am I trying to get rid of
[1:42:51] Williams
[1:42:52] y'all hear what I'm saying because God
[1:42:55] even took Joshua
[1:42:57] Moses is dead but remember everything
[1:43:01] Moses
[1:43:03] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:17] in order to connect with Isaac
[1:43:23] it's sad to say see but there are so
[1:43:27] many people but yeah are so entwined
[1:43:32] in a system
[1:43:35] no idea that they're being deceived
[1:43:40] oh I can preach to you and make you
[1:43:44] think you're gonna go sweeping through
[1:43:45] the city
[1:43:46] but I'm gonna bring you some quotes
[1:43:50] that your own Prophet has said
[1:43:53] right now you might think that these are
[1:43:55] my words that I'm speaking you may think
[1:43:58] that these are my words
[1:44:01] but I'm speaking from the words that
[1:44:04] William Branham previous to the power
[1:44:06] curve William Branham what kind of image
[1:44:08] are you trying to come in yeah
[1:44:12] and don't you think I don't see and then
[1:44:15] when I came into this message everybody
[1:44:18] was wearing belt big belt buckles
[1:44:21] cardboard boots they both did the cowboy
[1:44:24] hats
[1:44:25] sent you what image were they betraying
[1:44:29] yeah
[1:44:30] they were they were portraying the image
[1:44:34] of William Brothers
[1:44:35] come on somebody because you wear a
[1:44:38] cowboy hat come over here a pair of blue
[1:44:42] jeans a big belt buckle that don't put
[1:44:45] you in the message
[1:44:48] no no sir
[1:44:50] but people were doing that
[1:44:59] I've heard so many stories
[1:45:01] but let me tell you something
[1:45:04] works on the end condition
[1:45:07] but people are deceived sometimes
[1:45:11] I've had people oh man I better not go
[1:45:14] there I might make somebody really mad
[1:45:16] but the things that people do when they
[1:45:19] go down to Jeffersonville due to the
[1:45:21] grave of the Prophet it is amazing you
[1:45:24] might as well be a Catholic and go see
[1:45:26] Saint Peter and kisses
[1:45:34] amen amen who made that thing a shrine
[1:45:39] it's the truth people of God
[1:45:46] we got to love Jesus
[1:45:50] the god that William random taught us
[1:45:53] America
[1:46:01] you know some of these people don't came
[1:46:03] you know I fought a long time or
[1:46:05] something I used to hear this thing they

[1:46:57] big dogs now
[1:47:03] you know it just
[1:47:06] I'm just saying
[1:47:08] excuse me
[1:47:10] not trying to make a joke but my point
[1:47:13] is there is so much perversion
[1:47:17] if I'm a woman but I but I'm a man
[1:47:22] what
[1:47:26] did y'all hear what I said
[1:47:28] yeah hardly nobody said amenities
[1:47:32] if you're not careful she would never be
[1:47:34] fast these things are gonna brainwash
[1:47:36] you and you won't become insensitive
[1:47:42] Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying
[1:47:44] hallelujah
[1:47:47] listen you you I can marry whatever and
[1:47:50] whoever I want no no no no
[1:47:54] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:47:58] fine we're living in a sinful Society
[1:48:02] a society full of sins
[1:48:07] I saw one time when I used to have
[1:48:10] YouTube
[1:48:11] black ladies
[1:48:14] saying she was white
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:19] I mean must be under that skin because
[1:48:24] and I saw a white woman saying she was
[1:48:27] black
[1:48:32] my eyes betrayed me okay cause I know
[1:48:37] black when I see it and I know white
[1:48:40] when I see it and you can wanna be
[1:48:42] whatever you are but you want to be but
[1:48:45] God made you who you are you
[1:48:48] ought to be happy about who you are
[1:48:51] what was that
[1:48:53] I love my brothers who are white and my
[1:48:55] brothers
[1:48:56] whatever the case but I have never is
[1:49:01] that a shame of who I am
[1:49:06] and you shouldn't be ashamed of who you
[1:49:08] are
[1:49:11] what image are you reflecting I'm coming
[1:49:14] I'm coming to where I'm coming
[1:49:16] when you make an image you make an exact
[1:49:19] cards a lot of us love to take pictures
[1:49:25] Amen in those photos you know especially
[1:49:28] when they make you look good
[1:49:30] right some photos somehow to make they
[1:49:33] know how to make you look a little
[1:49:34] thinner you know
[1:49:36] who's there
[1:49:38] we love those pictures
[1:49:41] Hallelujah but you see that is the kind
[1:49:44] of image sisters God wants out of you an
[1:49:47] exact copy good job
[1:49:50] Hallelujah not when it comes to likeness
[1:49:54] the difference between the likeness
[1:49:56] and and the the image is definitely much
[1:50:00] because when mankind was formed into the
[1:50:05] image of God
[1:50:06] hallelujah that's the upshouse
[1:50:10] God is a man he has two hands
[1:50:15] he has a head and a mouth he looks like
[1:50:18] a man
[1:50:19] Hallelujah and so therefore we are
[1:50:22] formed into that image
[1:50:24] when it comes to likeness
[1:50:28] characteristics
[1:50:30] it's the character of him
[1:50:33] hallelujah hallelujah that's what we
[1:50:36] want we want God to form us into his
[1:50:39] image and his likeness
[1:50:43] this is what the message bring to the
[1:50:45] particular message Hallelujah women be
[1:50:48] women
[1:50:49] be men y'all hear what I'm saying don't
[1:50:54] try to cross the natures
[1:51:04] you got to be careful
[1:51:10] influence is something else
[1:51:12] that's why people I tell you oh I'll
[1:51:17] never do that
[1:51:20] no the only way you can say that is that
[1:51:23] you truly been born again
[1:51:26] right it's the truth coming into the
[1:51:30] image
[1:51:32] now Jesus Christ the Bible said
[1:51:35] the image of the invisible God
[1:51:38] the first born of every creature
[1:51:42] Hallelujah I know people everybody don't
[1:51:46] like the way I preach
[1:51:48] I'm gonna tell you the truth
[1:51:51] and my truth don't go with the system of
[1:51:54] the message am I very thinner
[1:51:56] the system of the message
[1:51:59] I'm sorry no I'm not though I'm really
[1:52:02] not you know
[1:52:03] [Laughter]
[1:52:07] I'm not looking for people to like me
[1:52:10] I'm old enough to know better copies
[1:52:15] but what was what was that statement
[1:52:17] that Jesus made
[1:52:19] in Saint John 10 30 30. he said I and my
[1:52:25] father are once
[1:52:28] that meant God and man
[1:52:33] Union they became one
[1:52:36] my question is what are you becoming
[1:52:41] what are you becoming
[1:52:43] because the spirits of this world will
[1:52:46] reshape you
[1:52:48] Hallelujah
[1:52:50] think about it on all of the people that
[1:52:55] was with lots that went down to Sodom
[1:52:59] all of his husbands Deuces their wives
[1:53:03] Hallelujah
[1:53:06] foreign
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:36] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:53:42] you know this is the thing that Paul oh
[1:53:45] since the intro's good part had to deal
[1:53:47] with
[1:53:48] uh
[1:53:50] and and I'm saying like this one of the
[1:53:53] things
[1:53:54] that Satan brought in this day
[1:53:57] that's so corrupted to church in
[1:54:00] Christianity
[1:54:03] was women preachers
[1:54:09] um
[1:54:11] Paul had to deal with women preachers
[1:54:13] I'm saying this because Paul DeVille uh
[1:54:16] you got to understand
[1:54:19] a woman preacher can't bring you to
[1:54:21] Perfection
[1:54:23] cannot bring you to Perfection
[1:54:27] first of all she's not even supposed to
[1:54:29] be a preacher for me
[1:54:32] so I'm going to read you something it's
[1:54:34] out of order okay
[1:54:38] if you go to I'm going to women preacher
[1:54:41] churches and let me tell you something
[1:54:44] the men most of the Menace
[1:54:52] so if a minute
[1:54:56] because of the inspiration
[1:55:02] I can't imagine
[1:55:04] sitting up in the Pulpit my swab and my
[1:55:08] wife is the pastor and my family
[1:55:13] God have mercy your eyes tell you that's
[1:55:16] wrong it's wrong
[1:55:18] hallelujah hallelujah let me move on
[1:55:21] you know Paul said for it's a shame for
[1:55:24] a woman
[1:55:27] don't eat please
[1:55:29] now look at the question mark on each
[1:55:32] one of your your Bibles what
[1:55:36] the point what caused Paul to say that
[1:55:40] yes
[1:55:41] like that
[1:55:44] now if you ever get the letters that the
[1:55:47] Corinthians wrote to Paul because
[1:55:51] now you can get them in any good library
[1:55:57] that the Corinthians wrote to Paul
[1:56:00] come on they wrote and told him
[1:56:05] after these women who were converted
[1:56:10] they had a goddess over them
[1:56:15] and was called Diana
[1:56:18] and she was of Ephesus also defects and
[1:56:22] the Corinthians worshiped the same
[1:56:26] cause it was a heathen worship
[1:56:30] and they found a rock a rock out in the
[1:56:34] field one day
[1:56:46] and she dropped her image down to us
[1:56:50] do you see what I'm saying if you put
[1:56:54] the woman in that position
[1:56:56] you're now looking at a different image
[1:57:00] of God
[1:57:01] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:07] right oh my
[1:57:11] God yes we he said they said he's OD God
[1:57:16] is a woman and she dropped her image

[1:57:20] and the temple was Far Beyond Solomon's
[1:57:23] Temple

[1:57:31] the world today
[1:57:33] but the world is following
[1:57:36] it's women preachers that's risen to the
[1:57:39] tops
[1:57:43] ability

[1:58:06] they can preach I've heard women preach
[1:58:10] that will put some men to shame
[1:58:14] but they're still out of order
[1:58:17] and let me tell you what the same
[1:58:21] anointing that anoints the man the
[1:58:23] preach it's the same anointing that
[1:58:25] anoints that woman to preach

[1:58:55] they were tired or left because they
[1:58:56] were fed up
[1:58:58] but either way it goes I I have to
[1:59:01] preach what he wants me to pray
[1:59:04] and she dropped her image down to us
[1:59:06] right

[2:07:46] when you're skeptical the word being
[2:07:48] right
[2:07:49] you just might as well stay back
[2:07:52] until first you believe
[2:07:56] what is he said
[2:07:58] unbelief there's only two elements that
[2:08:01] control the human being
[2:08:05] that's either doubt or faith
[2:08:08] one or the other
[2:08:10] you Pro you possess of one that
[2:08:14] dominates your life
[2:08:19] just depend on how much Faith you have
[2:08:22] come here how high you can rise come on
[2:08:27] I'm almost done just give me a few more
[2:08:28] minutes see because we're talking about
[2:08:31] an image we're talking about that the
[2:08:33] image of Christ
[2:08:39] it's more than going to a message
[2:08:43] it's more than just believing brother
[2:08:46] is a prophet you've got to meet Jesus
[2:08:50] Christ
[2:08:52] listen when it comes to Faith that
[2:08:56] Romans told just said to Jesus just
[2:08:59] speak the word hallelujah
[2:09:03] God's word still prevails he is still
[2:09:07] the mighty conqueror Hallelujah is that
[2:09:11] right the Roman went out to meet Jesus
[2:09:14] and he said I'm not worthy that you
[2:09:18] would come under my roof
[2:09:20] I'm not worthy I don't count myself that
[2:09:24] way
[2:09:25] but said my son is very sick and you
[2:09:29] just speak the words
[2:09:32] my son will live
[2:09:34] what was it
[2:09:36] distance make no difference
[2:09:41] see because God is omnipresent God is
[2:09:46] omnipotent and everywhere God is
[2:09:50] omnipotent is there and God being omnip
[2:09:54] I'm the president
[2:09:56] that makes God everywhere
[2:10:01] God is just as great in Germany in
[2:10:05] Switzerland oh not mine down in streets
[2:10:09] Down in Africa right this minute as he
[2:10:13] is right here
[2:10:16] oh there you are God
[2:10:20] see faith has that
[2:10:22] we know that this dimensional
[2:10:24] dimensional
[2:10:26] we know that God is here he's not a
[2:10:30] million miles away he said I'm 90. I'm
[2:10:34] even in your mouth
[2:10:36] that's how close he is hallelujah God
[2:10:40] and when you got him on the inside
[2:10:42] you know he's there
[2:10:45] has nothing to do with feelings
[2:10:48] must be your foundation
[2:10:51] the only thing that you have to do is
[2:10:54] you speak the word he says now Faith
[2:10:57] doesn't rest
[2:11:01] now Faith does the rest of it that's
[2:11:04] Faith does the rest so you must have
[2:11:07] faith for foundations
[2:11:10] [Music]
[2:11:20] that's the reason I believe the world
[2:11:23] Hallelujah and when God speaks anything
[2:11:27] how many of y'all believe that when God
[2:11:30] speaks anything
[2:11:32] got to happen
[2:11:34] Hallelujah
[2:11:35] yes sir you'll never be able to agree
[2:11:39] upon the word of God
[2:11:45] you'll never do it you've got to be born
[2:11:48] again
[2:11:50] you got to be born again
[2:11:53] it produces Faith Hallelujah after you
[2:11:57] get Faith this right here
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:31] y'all don't even understand
[2:12:36] blue let me let me use this because this
[2:12:39] is what the Lord just brought to my
[2:12:40] heart
[2:12:43] you'll see
[2:12:46] Moses and zephyrah
[2:12:56] and brother balham said they were both
[2:12:58] hot tempered uh
[2:13:04] that means they fussed and thought a lot
[2:13:10] and God and Jew
[2:13:13] told ID
[2:13:17] them to be married
[2:13:21] you mean to tell me
[2:13:23] I got a bad temper cause yeah and God
[2:13:27] would cause me to marry a woman that got
[2:13:28] a bad girl
[2:13:36] hallelujah hallelujah the reason being
[2:13:39] that is there is character to be
[2:13:43] developing
[2:13:49] he's your character builder but he calls
[2:13:53] people and you you are his character
[2:13:55] builder it was that was that song
[2:13:59] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[2:14:02] God put you together
[2:14:07] on sharpening eyes
[2:14:11] but in order for it to work
[2:14:15] you both have so you both have to humble
[2:14:18] yourself
[2:14:21] to the will of God
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:55] I bet he did
[2:14:57] come on
[2:14:58] yep Oh Happy Day
[2:15:09] that came right from the throne
[2:15:13] faith is the foundation
[2:15:16] Christianity
[2:15:20] but I'm going to tell you how to build
[2:15:23] your spirituality
[2:15:25] that's why I said you need to listen to
[2:15:27] the Statue of a perfect man
[2:15:30] where God can dwell
[2:15:34] he wants to dwell in you he wants to
[2:15:38] make you like himself
[2:15:40] he wants you to be reflected
[2:15:43] reflecting reflecting rather his being
[2:15:47] that's what you've been made for God
[2:15:51] created you to reflect his beings
[2:15:55] Hallelujah is this all right sometimes
[2:15:58] God gotta beat you like beating gold
[2:16:00] right sometimes the ham is constantly
[2:16:03] hitting you and you don't even
[2:16:05] understand what God is trying to get out
[2:16:09] of you he's trying to see his image
[2:16:18] the selfishness
[2:16:21] the malice that all of those things that
[2:16:24] you hold the empty The Strife in all of
[2:16:27] that must disappear
[2:16:30] until he gets his images
[2:16:34] foreign
[2:16:38] but I'm going to tell you how to build
[2:16:40] your house where God can dwell
[2:16:44] Hallelujah he wants to dwell in you he
[2:16:48] wants to make you like himself he wants
[2:16:51] you to be reflected or reflecting rather
[2:16:54] his being
[2:16:57] hallelujah hallelujah I got 15 more
[2:16:59] minutes before 12. that's all I want I'm
[2:17:01] gonna ask for you right I'll let you go
[2:17:03] at 12.
[2:17:05] is that okay
[2:17:07] thank you
[2:17:09] in the stats of a perfect man
[2:17:11] he said virtue
[2:17:14] if anyone knows what the word virtue
[2:17:17] means
[2:17:21] because the Bible tells us add to your
[2:17:23] faith
[2:17:25] virtue about you and faith in God's word
[2:17:31] as simple as it is
[2:17:33] that God's word is always right
[2:17:41] anyone knows what the word virtue means
[2:17:46] and we must have it if virtue went out
[2:17:51] from him to hear the woman that was sick
[2:17:55] he's expecting the same virtue
[2:17:59] in his church see that's what I'm
[2:18:02] talking about when the sick come to us
[2:18:16] hey you hear what I'm saying
[2:18:20] he expecting the same virtue in his
[2:18:22] picture
[2:18:24] because he was our example and if he had
[2:18:28] virtue to give to the people
[2:18:30] he's expecting us to have virtues
[2:18:36] and what is virtue
[2:18:39] virtue is strange
[2:18:42] and Power
[2:19:22] this is what the wise versions
[2:19:30] yeah amen introvert your virtue I I
[2:19:34] acknowledge so I'm hurrying up now
[2:19:36] God cannot lie during the performance
[2:19:40] and his word cannot fail
[2:19:43] that's knowledge to judge right from
[2:19:46] wrong
[2:19:52] and acknowledge that the word of God is
[2:19:55] right I cannot lie whatever God says he
[2:20:01] is able to perform
[2:20:07] foreign
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:21:04] right Abraham and Sarah and Abraham
[2:21:07] believe them
[2:21:08] and when he was 100 years
[2:21:12] older the promise of God through
[2:21:14] unbelief
[2:21:15] God said you're going to have a baby
[2:21:19] Abraham didn't stagger
[2:21:22] five years he had the same testimony
[2:21:27] God said he was going to give me a baby
[2:21:29] y'all hear what I'm saying
[2:21:32] oh my it's not like some of us we get
[2:21:36] prayed for the flu news
[2:21:40] and it don't disappear all of a minute
[2:21:42] in a minute
[2:21:45] and we get we get all uh messed up in
[2:21:48] our minds prayed
[2:21:52] I pray is it create and maybe the
[2:21:56] medicine will heal me and productively
[2:21:58] come over
[2:22:00] that medicine can't hear you let me come
[2:22:03] on you're just psyching yourself
[2:22:06] God is the Healer
[2:22:12] how many times you've taken medicine
[2:22:14] and it really laughed at you hey
[2:22:20] didn't do nothing
[2:22:23] right see what but when you call on
[2:22:26] Jesus
[2:22:28] he comes to your rescue he's yeah
[2:22:34] listen I'm gonna move on because right
[2:22:37] right true knowledge from God
[2:22:42] you can't even have faith without God
[2:22:48] you don't have faith you ask of God
[2:22:52] and God will give it to you Jesus
[2:22:56] he wants you to have faith in him
[2:23:00] but when you can see the scriptures
[2:23:03] contradictory
[2:23:08] like Matthew 28 Acts 2 38. Hallelujah
[2:23:13] yes did you know that the baptism in the
[2:23:16] name of the father and of the son and of
[2:23:17] the Holy Ghost
[2:23:18] basically an adulterous baptism
[2:23:22] man
[2:23:24] that wasn't God
[2:23:26] [Applause]
[2:23:28] hallelujah and if you're true
[2:23:32] you'll be baptized in the name of the
[2:23:35] Lord Jesus
[2:23:40] I don't know who's going to be saved
[2:23:41] outside but I do know that the bride has
[2:23:44] a certain standard that she must
[2:23:46] secretly Hallelujah
[2:23:50] hallelujah hallelujah that you can see
[2:23:52] that that you know let me go on seeing
[2:23:55] the revelation of God the whole world is
[2:23:59] wrote in Mysteries
[2:24:02] only the knowledge of God
[2:24:05] Hallelujah
[2:24:21] [Music]
[2:24:30] oh man
[2:24:32] see God called Elijah and Elijah came to
[2:24:36] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:24:39] the apostolic faith
[2:24:41] look what brother random says Christ
[2:24:44] sent me peace to heal individuals to the
[2:24:49] statue of Jesus Christ
[2:24:51] that they might be the PowerHouse and
[2:24:56] the dwelling place of the Spirit
[2:24:59] by his word
[2:25:02] by his words
[2:25:04] build up the individual to that place
[2:25:09] now you don't heard the message all
[2:25:12] these years
[2:25:15] but what preacher
[2:25:18] just brought this to your attention how
[2:25:21] many signs this is what you need to be
[2:25:23] working on
[2:25:26] amen
[2:25:27] what good is your shouting in your
[2:25:29] dancing gonna do
[2:25:31] y'all I say that because I enjoy
[2:25:35] shouting and dancing don't get me wrong
[2:25:37] but I know at the end of the day when I
[2:25:41] walk out of this place
[2:25:42] that's shouting and dancing I leave here
[2:25:46] and if I didn't get the word in my heart
[2:25:49] the devil is coming after me
[2:25:52] sometimes we eat before I even get out
[2:25:55] the door could you solve the same spot
[2:25:57] amen
[2:26:05] I can't finish this but um there's so
[2:26:08] much more I need to say
[2:26:15] one thing Faith doesn't reason yeah
[2:26:22] it's almost like Mary and mother name
[2:26:24] Lord we know
[2:26:26] at that Resurrection
[2:26:29] the dead is going to raise
[2:26:32] Jesus shut that down he says I am the
[2:26:35] resurrection
[2:26:37] if you believe you shall see
[2:26:41] but within their minds people
[2:26:44] man who's been dead for days
[2:26:48] brought it down now how can he live
[2:26:52] again
[2:26:53] they couldn't fathom it they couldn't
[2:26:55] imagine
[2:26:56] but Jesus basically saying I am God
[2:27:00] I am the resurrection so let me tell you
[2:27:03] something it's Jesus Christ let me ask
[2:27:05] you something it's Jesus Christ the word
[2:27:08] of God
[2:27:09] hallelujah where the word of God cannot

[2:33:03] I I remember when I came up in an
[2:33:06] atmosphere like that it makes you so
[2:33:08] nervous I can't hardly take it I don't
[2:33:10] like raised voices and all of that I
[2:33:13] can't do that unless I'm preaching but
[2:33:16] so but that comes I'm not picking on
[2:33:18] anybody no one particular person what
[2:33:20] I'm trying to say is those things must
[2:33:23] die
[2:33:29] bloody noses and all that kind of stuff
[2:33:36] foreign
[2:33:37] you know I'm laughing but it ain't fun
[2:33:41] the character must change
[2:33:47] I've never in the time my wife and I've
[2:33:50] been married have I ever struck her once
[2:33:53] and I told my wife she's sitting here as
[2:33:55] a witness and my father I told my wife
[2:33:57] the day I hit you will be the day I
[2:34:01] divorce you because I don't love you
[2:34:04] anymore don't you beat me and tell me
[2:34:08] you love me
[2:34:10] you are insane
[2:34:18] I'll tell you what man
[2:34:20] I wish I could hire a hit man for you
[2:34:24] I can't beat you but I can find somebody
[2:34:29] um
[2:34:31] no I'm talking from the natural now I
[2:34:34] can't stand that
[2:34:37] I can't stand it that gets really next
[2:34:40] to me I don't know
[2:34:45] foreign
[2:34:49] like I said I'm not picking on any
[2:34:51] particular person I'm preaching what God
[2:34:54] wants me to preach I'm trying to help
[2:34:57] and my thing is if those things be in
[2:35:00] you you know now by the word of God is
[2:35:03] things that you've got to get rid of
[2:35:05] it and that comes by faith and prayers
[2:35:10] controlling your tongue
[2:35:12] boy a lot of us this is what brother I'm
[2:35:15] saying boy a lot of us are going to fall
[2:35:18] off before we get started
[2:35:23] you know don't think you're the only one
[2:35:26] some people just know how to hide there
[2:35:28] yeah
[2:35:31] I remember seeing a sister come to
[2:35:33] church
[2:35:34] not here but I saw it with a black eye I
[2:35:40] wanted to ask her so bad
[2:35:42] how did you get that black guy
[2:35:45] I didn't want her to lie to me though
[2:35:52] anyway let's go home and you know I like
[2:35:55] Lord have mercy
[2:35:58] but let's move on
[2:36:00] see then we wonder why God is not in the
[2:36:04] church
[2:36:06] during Miracles and things that we used
[2:36:10] to do and it shows people
[2:36:12] because we can't keep our mouths
[2:36:15] even Shane who said that your religion
[2:36:18] is vain exactly right on your tongue
[2:36:23] is
[2:36:47] [Music]
[2:37:00] amen hallelujah hallelujah is that the
[2:37:02] way you want to be
[2:37:05] when you roll upon
[2:37:07] round not by
[2:37:10] let him be your example
[2:37:15] I can't preach the whole thing I said I
[2:37:17] was going to stop
[2:37:19] maybe I'll try to pick up on something
[2:37:22] and maybe a few of these quotes and
[2:37:23] something else but people of God
[2:38:06] y'all understand what I'm saying so I'm
[2:38:09] just saying these things happen all over
[2:38:13] but no matter how where it happened
[2:38:17] all of us need an overhaul
[2:38:20] [Music]
[2:38:21] we need we need to emptying out
[2:38:25] we need to die into ourselves
[2:38:28] and we need to love one another
[2:38:33] Hallelujah I just marvel at people you
[2:38:37] guys are grown-ups
[2:38:39] right how many of you can go out there
[2:38:43] being one of those trees out there
[2:38:48] it's past the point of bending
[2:38:52] and a lot of times we think when we get
[2:38:55] married we can make each other what we
[2:38:58] want them to be
[2:39:00] what about God
[2:39:03] wants you to be something
[2:39:06] hallelujah hallelujah and instead of
[2:39:08] trying to change each other we need to
[2:39:10] focus on ourselves that God can change
[2:39:15] and if God changed us he will change the
[2:39:19] situation amen
[2:39:25] you love the Lord
[2:39:28] I'm just trying to get us all saved
[2:39:32] you know when when we walk when we March
[2:39:35] through the Gates of Heaven I want to be
[2:39:37] able to look to the left and right see
[2:39:39] some of these familiar faces
[2:39:42] see I'm gonna make it I'm determined to
[2:39:45] make it and by God's grace he gave me
[2:39:49] that determination
[2:39:52] every day you got to die to yourself
[2:39:56] let's stand Everything You Must Die to
[2:39:59] yourself
[2:40:01] whenever you get out of line you
[2:40:05] ought to think about what you are
[2:40:07] reflecting
[2:40:08] am I expressing Jesus Christ in my
