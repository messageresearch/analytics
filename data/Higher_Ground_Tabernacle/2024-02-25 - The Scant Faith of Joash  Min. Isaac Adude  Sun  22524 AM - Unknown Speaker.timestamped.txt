[49:35] word amen let's open our Bibles in the
[49:37] book of Second
[49:39] Kings uh chapter 13 verse 14-1

[50:19] Fallen
[50:20] sick now Elisha was Fallen sick of his
[50:23] sickness whereof he died
[50:25] and joash the king of Israel came down
[50:28] unto him and wept over his face and said
[50:32] oh my father my father The Chariot of
[50:35] Israel and the horsemen
[50:48] thereof and elishah said unto him take
[50:51] bow and arrows and he took unto him bow
[50:55] and arrow
[51:01] arrows and he said unto the king of
[51:03] Israel put th hand upon the bow and he
[51:06] put his hand upon the bow upon it and
[51:10] Elisha put his hand upon the king's
[51:21] hand and he said open the window
[51:23] Eastward and he open opened it then
[51:26] Elisha said shoot and he shot and he
[51:29] said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance
[51:32] and the arrow of deliverance from Syria
[51:35] for thou shal Smite the syrians in AEK

[53:51] honor in Jesus Christ name we
[53:54] pray amen amen amen you may be
[53:57] seated uh this morning we have a little
[54:01] subject here that we wanted to share
[54:03] with
[54:04] [Music]
[54:06] you amen we entitled The Skin faith of
[54:14] Joes amen the SC faith
[54:18] of uh like I said we started this uh
[54:21] during the watch night we preached a
[54:22] little bit about this
[54:26] amen and I felt L to go through to go
[54:29] with this
[54:31] again and we'll go wherever God leads
[54:35] us amen so here in 2 Kings chap 13:1
[54:39] 14-1
[54:41] 17 amen it's a story the end of when
[54:45] Elijah came to the end of his life he
[54:47] was about to
[54:51] die amen so joash knew heard the news
[54:54] that elishah was
[54:57] sick so he went cuz they were in trouble
[55:00] I mean they were having you know enemies
[55:02] coming and attacking them you
[55:05] know amen he knew that every time that
[55:08] the prophet would give a word and that
[55:10] word will always come to happen that was
[55:12] will always
[55:16] happen so when you heard that elasa was
[55:21] sick amen he was a little worried about
[55:23] the situation that was going
[55:27] on Amen because they needed a prophet in
[55:29] order for them to have
[55:32] Victory amen so now he went to
[55:35] Elijah amen so now if you read the verse
[55:38] 14 the Bible says that now uh uh we in
[55:41] the middle it said that and joash the
[55:43] king of Israel came down unto
[55:51] him and wept over his face and say
[55:57] amen so now here listen to what joah
[55:59] said he said oh my father my father The
[56:03] Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[56:07] thereof amen it was that having
[56:10] reverence toward the
[56:13] prophet amen because when you go see a
[56:16] prophet of God or a man of God you need
[56:18] to have reverence when you go see God
[56:20] you need to have
[56:23] reverence so he had to have
[56:26] reverence he said my father my father
[56:29] The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[56:33] thereof Amen in other words it means
[56:36] that you are greater than the Char than
[56:37] all the Chariots of
[56:41] Israel amen you're stronger than all the
[56:43] Chariots of
[56:45] Israel and God knowing and seeing that
[56:50] reverence amen gave him a
[56:52] blessing Amen in verse 15 it says that
[56:55] and Elisha said unto
[56:58] him take bow and
[57:01] arrows and he took unto him bow and
[57:05] arrows and he said to the king of Israel
[57:08] put thine hand upon the bow and he put
[57:11] his hand upon the bow and upon
[57:18] it and Elijah put his hands upon the
[57:21] king's
[57:23] hand so now verse 17 it says that and he
[57:28] said open the window
[57:32] Eastward and and and joash did exactly
[57:35] what the prophet told him to do he
[57:37] opened
[57:39] it then Elisha said
[57:42] shoot amen he did the exact same thing
[57:45] he shot
[57:47] it then Elisha said that the arrow of
[57:49] the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of
[57:52] deliverance from Syria for thou shal
[57:54] smart Syrian in AIC till thou have
[57:58] consumed
[58:05] them amen here everything was
[58:08] clear amen the instructions were
[58:11] clear amen Elisha told him to open the
[58:14] word to open the the window is word he
[58:16] did exactly
[58:20] that Ela asked him to take the the the
[58:23] bow he did exactly
[58:27] that amen he asked him to take the
[58:30] arrows he did exactly what Elisha told
[58:33] him no Revelation was needed I mean it
[58:36] was clear you do exactly what the
[58:38] prophet
[58:42] say Amen but now if you read a little
[58:44] down
[58:46] here amen Verse 18 down you said that
[58:50] here the Bible says that and he said
[58:51] take the arrows and he took them
[58:58] and he said unto the king of Israel
[59:00] Smite upon the ground and he smot
[59:06] Thrice amen so this is where the
[59:09] Revelation was
[59:11] needed amen because in the beginning of
[59:14] of the
[59:17] conversation amen Elijah told him to
[59:19] open where to open the window open the
[59:23] window
[59:28] amen he followed all the
[59:30] instructions amen so now here in verse
[59:33] 18 amen Elisha told him to take the
[59:38] arrows amen Elisha did not tell him how
[59:41] many arrows he was supposed to
[59:44] take amen so now joash had to have the
[59:50] Revelation amen that this is for him an
[59:52] opportunity to have victory over all
[59:55] these
[59:59] problems amen but he only took three
[1:00:03] arrows amen and we know the story that
[1:00:05] Elisha got mad he was
[1:00:09] frustrated the Bible continues and said
[1:00:11] that and the man of God was wough with
[1:00:17] him and said thou should have smitten
[1:00:20] five or six
[1:00:23] times
[1:00:25] then H thou smitten Syria till thou has
[1:00:28] consumed
[1:00:31] it whereas thou sh SM whereas now thou
[1:00:34] shall Smite Syria by by
[1:00:38] Thrice amen El joash had many
[1:00:42] problems amen he had many fights that he
[1:00:44] had to
[1:00:46] overcome amen he needed Victory all over
[1:00:49] I mean in many different
[1:00:52] ways but now an opportunity was given to
[1:00:56] him but instead of taking arrows for
[1:00:59] every situations of his
[1:01:04] life amen Elisha I mean joash only took
[1:01:07] three
[1:01:08] arrows amen he knew exactly what those
[1:01:11] arrrow was was
[1:01:13] was amen because Elijah told him that
[1:01:16] these are the arrows of
[1:01:20] Deliverance he knew what the arrows
[1:01:23] represented amen he knew why he was
[1:01:26] supposed to shoot those
[1:01:29] arrows because elishah was
[1:01:31] clear it say that the arrow of the
[1:01:34] Lord's
[1:01:37] deliverance and the arrows of
[1:01:39] deliverance from
[1:01:41] Syria amen but now an opportunity was
[1:01:44] given to him take all of
[1:01:47] them amen but he only took
[1:01:50] three you say well brother Isaac now if
[1:01:53] that same opportunity is given to me I'm
[1:01:55] not I'm pretty sure I'm not going to
[1:01:56] take I'm not going to make that same
[1:02:01] mistake the prophet talks about that
[1:02:03] young man that that the king sent to go
[1:02:05] look for
[1:02:08] Jesus amen to go invite Jesus to come to
[1:02:11] the
[1:02:13] feast amen the prophet said that that
[1:02:15] man went cities after cities to find
[1:02:17] Jesus and it was hard to find
[1:02:20] him amen every time he was going to a
[1:02:23] certain city the but he was told that
[1:02:25] Jesus Just
[1:02:28] Left amen he goes to the next city they
[1:02:31] tell him that where Jesus who went to uh
[1:02:33] whatever City he would have
[1:02:37] gone but and finally he came face to
[1:02:40] face to
[1:02:42] Jesus amen the man only gave that
[1:02:44] invitation and then returned his back
[1:02:46] and
[1:02:50] left amen and the prophet said that if
[1:02:52] it was him amen he would they would
[1:02:55] have asked for forgiveness for his
[1:03:00] sins amen and sins would have been
[1:03:03] forgiven at that same
[1:03:06] moment then after that the prophet
[1:03:09] continues and he says that many people
[1:03:11] today that will say well if they see
[1:03:13] Jesus today they will do the um they
[1:03:15] will ask for forgiveness and
[1:03:20] all then the prophet L looked at Bram
[1:03:23] Tabernacle and he said that you have the
[1:03:25] same opportunity
[1:03:29] today he said that every time you come
[1:03:31] to
[1:03:32] church amen you meet
[1:03:35] Jesus amen and you go back with the same
[1:03:38] sins that you came in
[1:03:41] with am you are missing your opportunity
[1:03:44] for your
[1:03:46] forgiveness amen every time you come to
[1:03:49] church amen because you pray Lord I want
[1:03:51] you to be with
[1:03:53] us
[1:03:55] Lord we pray that you come down and you
[1:03:57] join
[1:03:58] us amen and the prophet preached about
[1:04:00] Jesus never misses his opportunity I
[1:04:03] mean is
[1:04:06] R amen he's always there when you when
[1:04:09] you invite him to
[1:04:10] come amen he will always show up when
[1:04:13] you invite him to
[1:04:15] come amen but we come to church amen and
[1:04:19] go back the way we came
[1:04:21] in we are doing the exact same thing
[1:04:24] that that young man
[1:04:27] did missing out on the opportunity of
[1:04:30] Our
[1:04:31] Lives amen missing out for going back
[1:04:35] without asking for
[1:04:38] forgiveness amen that opportunity will
[1:04:40] not be there
[1:04:42] forever amen so every time you get in
[1:04:44] that
[1:04:45] moment amen every time you invite Jesus
[1:04:48] to
[1:04:49] come man you have to take you have to
[1:04:52] take good care of him amen you have to
[1:04:55] take advantage of that
[1:04:58] opportunity because Jesus will always
[1:05:00] show
[1:05:01] up amen but the blessing that you will
[1:05:04] receive amen it will depend on how much
[1:05:07] care you amen it depends on how much
[1:05:10] attention you're giving
[1:05:14] him amen Jesus showed up to that
[1:05:19] Feast amen he knew everything he knew
[1:05:21] exactly what was going to happen
[1:05:24] amen but he showed up
[1:05:26] anyway amen because Jesus always show up
[1:05:29] when you invite
[1:05:30] him but the
[1:05:32] blessing amen depending on how much how
[1:05:36] much they took care of
[1:05:39] him amen if you living in a
[1:05:42] corner amen he's going to go back with
[1:05:44] his
[1:05:45] blessings amen but if you be like that
[1:05:49] woman amen go buy that
[1:05:52] perfume amen wash his
[1:05:54] feet amen take care of him amen and he
[1:05:59] will bless you amen it doesn't matter
[1:06:01] how big your sins
[1:06:04] are it doesn't matter how in darkness
[1:06:06] you find yourself
[1:06:09] in it doesn't matter how deep the the
[1:06:12] the hole you find yourself in amen as
[1:06:15] long as you take care of
[1:06:17] himen he will take care of you amen as
[1:06:21] long as you take care of him he will
[1:06:24] always take care of you amen because
[1:06:27] Jesus always pay his
[1:06:29] debt amen Jesus always pay his
[1:06:32] debt every single sacrifice that you
[1:06:35] make for
[1:06:36] him amen he will always be
[1:06:39] rewarded asked Peter amen Peter asked
[1:06:42] Jesus and said Lord we forsake we we
[1:06:44] left our our wives and we left our
[1:06:48] families we left everything that we were
[1:06:51] doing and we decided to follow you
[1:06:54] amen so what are you going to give us
[1:06:56] back as
[1:06:58] reward Jesus looked at Peter he said I
[1:07:01] will give you back a h 100f of
[1:07:04] everything amen I will get I will pay
[1:07:06] you back everything amen because Jesus
[1:07:10] always amen pay his
[1:07:13] debt amen and so many people
[1:07:16] today amen there in front of a tribe
[1:07:19] where they're in front of something that
[1:07:20] they can't
[1:07:22] overcome they go to an
[1:07:26] expert amen and that person tell them
[1:07:28] that you know there is no
[1:07:31] hope there's just no way this will
[1:07:36] happen what we do we lose faith in
[1:07:40] Christ amen we forget about everything
[1:07:42] that that happened
[1:07:45] before in other ways we behave like the
[1:07:47] disciples in the
[1:07:50] boat amen coming coming from a Revival
[1:07:53] meeting

[1:07:58] sick they saw how Jesus multiplied the
[1:08:01] bread amen they saw how Jesus multipli
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:06] fish amen now in the boat Jesus was
[1:08:10] sleeping amen and the devil decided to
[1:08:13] shake them a little
[1:08:15] bit amen they forgot all about the
[1:08:19] Revival they forgot about all the fire
[1:08:22] that they were they had
[1:08:24] all the jumping and shouting and
[1:08:26] Hallelujah and an amen that they
[1:08:28] responded when Jesus was doing all the
[1:08:29] great
[1:08:32] things in that time where they that the
[1:08:35] most they forgot all about
[1:08:39] it amen the prophet
[1:08:41] says he said that the reason Moses
[1:08:44] failed in the first
[1:08:49] place he said that here is what was the
[1:08:52] matter it was the lack of having what
[1:08:56] the burning bush
[1:09:02] had that's right and what's our failure
[1:09:06] today
[1:09:08] is is lack of having what the Holy
[1:09:11] Spirit
[1:09:14] has and the Holy Spirit has all good
[1:09:17] things for
[1:09:19] us if you receive the Holy
[1:09:22] Spirit then all things are
[1:09:26] possible and not only
[1:09:28] possible amen but promise to
[1:09:31] us amen Jesus said ask the father
[1:09:35] anything in my
[1:09:37] name and I'll do it if you abide in me
[1:09:42] and my words in you ask what you will
[1:09:47] and it'll be given to you see when we
[1:09:50] step into the light of God's when when
[1:09:52] we step into the light of God
[1:09:55] word with the unction of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:58] to shine the light on
[1:10:01] it impossible becomes little things
[1:10:06] then amen God asks us to believe his
[1:10:10] word he sends the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:10:12] Spirit to energize that word when he
[1:10:15] falls into
[1:10:18] it when the words being preached and the
[1:10:21] Holy Spirit brings the word
[1:10:24] he energizes
[1:10:34] it God said I remembered my promise to
[1:10:38] Abraham Isaac and
[1:10:41] Jacob and I'm sending you down there to
[1:10:45] do
[1:10:47] it see then when God's
[1:10:51] word his promise
[1:10:54] becomes enlightened by the by the
[1:10:56] presence of the Angel of the
[1:11:00] Lord he said now stop Moses
[1:11:07] now he's on his
[1:11:11] road and God always keeps his
[1:11:15] promise the thing that people are
[1:11:17] lacking
[1:11:18] today amen is that experience of the
[1:11:21] burning
[1:11:22] bush amen because that experience of the
[1:11:25] burning
[1:11:26] bush will make everything
[1:11:30] possible amen the prophet said not only
[1:11:32] will make it everything
[1:11:37] possible amen but he will but uh uh not
[1:11:41] only will make everything
[1:11:47] possible I'm sorry I'm looking for that
[1:11:49] what depart I just want to say exactly
[1:11:51] what he said
[1:11:52] here amen amen he said that and if we
[1:11:55] receive that Holy
[1:11:57] Spirit then all things are
[1:12:00] possible amen and not only
[1:12:03] possible amen but promised to
[1:12:06] us amen and God always remembers his
[1:12:10] promises amen if God promise you
[1:12:13] something amen it doesn't matter how
[1:12:15] long it will take amen God will always
[1:12:18] remember those
[1:12:20] promises amen but when when you receive
[1:12:22] the Holy Spirit
[1:12:25] his word becomes a promise to
[1:12:27] you amen every word of God becomes a
[1:12:30] promise to you amen it's like we singing
[1:12:33] in the like we sing it amen every word

[1:13:55] Egypt comes behind
[1:13:57] me I know the promise of God is with
[1:14:01] me and God will always remember his
[1:14:04] promises amen so that was enough for
[1:14:07] Moses amen that promise of God was
[1:14:09] enough for Moses amen Moses was going to
[1:14:13] Egypt with the promise of God Amen look
[1:14:16] at the

[1:14:32] about God because they would end up
[1:14:35] being in the cross with with they would
[1:14:37] end up being crucified and
[1:14:39] all amen but when that fire

[1:20:09] prayers amen there is nowhere in the
[1:20:11] Bible you say that God ask you to know
[1:20:14] what to pray or to have big words to
[1:20:16] tell
[1:20:21] him amen when disciples didn't know how
[1:20:24] what to what to
[1:20:26] say amen God told them the you know the
[1:20:29] prayers you know how father who are in
[1:20:34] heaven amen you can repeat that same
[1:20:37] prayer amen and you will see
[1:20:40] results you say but well what do you
[1:20:42] mean amen do you remember the story of
[1:20:45] the Prophet where he talked about that
[1:20:46] little
[1:20:49] girl amen his her mom was sick
[1:20:53] amen the little girl didn't know what to
[1:20:55] pray didn't know how to
[1:20:57] pray amen she didn't know how to make
[1:21:00] words amen but what that little girl
[1:21:04] Haden who was a genuine
[1:21:07] Faith amen the little girl did not try
[1:21:09] to make words and big words and try to
[1:21:12] impress god with
[1:21:15] it amen the little girl just closed her
[1:21:19] eyes amen and S and repeated the
[1:21:22] alphabet
[1:21:24] amen he said he went from a to to
[1:21:27] Z then he said
[1:21:29] Lord make out of this alphabet the words
[1:21:32] that will fit my
[1:21:35] needs am that's what you need to

[1:21:42] Amen just give him the
[1:21:44] alphabet amen tell him Lord make out of
[1:21:47] this I make out of these
[1:21:49] letters amen words that will go exactly
[1:21:53] words that will express my what I

[1:22:07] alphabet A to Z and her mom was
[1:22:11] healed amen so you might find yourself
[1:22:13] in the same
[1:22:15] situation amen just give him the
[1:22:18] alphabet amen cuz what you
[1:22:20] need amen it's faith
[1:22:23] amen because like I always say the Bible
[1:22:25] says that before you even open your
[1:22:30] mouth amen God say that before you open
[1:22:33] your
[1:22:36] mouth I already know what you're about
[1:22:38] to

[1:22:43] Faith amen because we go to God In
[1:22:46] Prayer you might spend an hour
[1:22:50] praying amen you will never ask for
[1:22:52] everything that you
[1:22:54] need amen there is just not enough time
[1:22:57] for you to do
[1:22:58] that amen and you won't even remember
[1:23:01] everything that you have to ask for God
[1:23:02] to
[1:23:03] God Amen so God technically doesn't just
[1:23:06] see or or hear the words that's coming
[1:23:09] from your
[1:23:12] mouth amen but he goes deeper than that
[1:23:16] amen he looked in your heart he looks in
[1:23:18] your heart amen he sees what you need
[1:23:22] amen and he gives you what you need amen
[1:23:25] because he said that before open your
[1:23:27] mouth and ask amen I the Lord has heard
[1:23:30] your
[1:23:31] prayer amen and give you whatever you
[1:23:34] wanted whatever you asked for amen so
[1:23:37] God will look in your heart and he said
[1:23:40] that my child needs this even though he
[1:23:43] forget about praying about
[1:23:45] this the bible say that the holy
[1:23:48] spirit amen intercedes for us amen the
[1:23:53] holy spirit amen he's our prayer
[1:23:56] warriors amen so he's there in he's
[1:23:59] there in front of the
[1:24:00] father amen praying for us amen looking
[1:24:04] in our lives amen seeing everything that
[1:24:07] we need amen and go with God Amen and
[1:24:12] ask in our behalf amen so that's the job
[1:24:15] of the holy spirit amen so what you need
[1:24:17] to do amen just have faith in that
[1:24:21] God to God with faith amen and know that
[1:24:25] the same God that I'm praying amen that
[1:24:28] God will give me what I'm asking
[1:24:31] for amen amen the prophet said that

[1:35:50] to go up and down
[1:35:53] amen you ask me and I'll tell you I
[1:35:55] don't know why God wanted it to be like
[1:35:58] that amen God could have just broke the
[1:36:01] rain when Elijah
[1:36:03] prayed but he wanted Gaz to go and see
[1:36:07] seven
[1:36:09] times until he saw that little

[1:36:18] times you it doesn't matter how many

[1:36:45] times amen for you might be saved 10
[1:36:49] times amen for Abraham he took 25

[1:37:31] until I see my healing amen I'm not
[1:37:34] going to stop amen until I can touch the
[1:37:37] fruit of my prayers amen so when you ask
[1:37:40] God for something am don't stop amen
[1:37:44] don't stop amen God has heard your
[1:37:47] prayer and the answer is on the way
[1:37:51] might be a little later it might it
[1:37:53] might be a little late amen but the
[1:37:56] answer is on the way just keep

[1:38:14] year look for it again it's been 10
[1:38:17] years I can't see it amen look for it
[1:38:20] again because God who gave the
[1:38:23] promise that same God will give it to
[1:38:26] you amen look at brother Brandon amen he
[1:38:29] struggled with that sickness his entire
[1:38:32] life am brother brenon prayed for for
[1:38:35] for for sickness that was worse than
[1:38:37] what he
[1:38:38] had amen and God gave healing
[1:38:41] instantly amen amen a young man was
[1:38:45] dead amen his body was all over the
[1:38:48] place amen but the man of God prayed for
[1:38:51] that that man amen he saw how the body
[1:38:54] came back
[1:38:55] together amen a little fish was dead he
[1:38:59] spoke the word and he gave the life to
[1:39:01] that little
[1:39:03] fish and that little fish just jumped
[1:39:06] and started swimming back again amen but
[1:39:09] here that manen struggling with a little
[1:39:12] sickness in his life he done prayed so
[1:39:16] many
[1:39:17] times but it seems like God was not
[1:39:19] hearing his prayer amen but you see that
[1:39:22] the prophet said amen he said that he
[1:39:25] never lost faith not even one
[1:39:27] time amen because he knew it doesn't
[1:39:30] matter how long it's going to
[1:39:33] take the seventh dove will come
[1:39:36] back it doesn't matter how long it's
[1:39:39] going to
[1:39:40] take he's healing will
[1:39:43] come amen he's healing will come amen
[1:39:47] look at when God healed
[1:39:49] him God gave him healing at the end of
[1:39:52] his
[1:39:53] life to tell you one thing amen that it
[1:39:57] doesn't matter how long it's
[1:39:59] taking if God gave you a
[1:40:02] promise amen rest assured that before
[1:40:05] you
[1:40:06] die that promise will come to pass amen
[1:40:10] you just be patient amen they that wait
[1:40:13] on the Lord amen shall renew their
[1:40:17] strength amen they shall Mount up like
[1:40:19] eagle amen they will run in not fence
[1:40:24] amen because they wait on the Lord amen
[1:40:27] their strength will be renewed amen it
[1:40:29] doesn't matter how long it's going to
[1:40:32] take amen I know God will bring it to
[1:40:35] pass just take the arrows of
[1:40:39] Deliverance just take it off for your
[1:40:41] life amen it doesn't matter if you're
[1:40:44] selfish amen that's the time for you to
[1:40:46] be selfish a little bit said Lord I'm
[1:40:49] taking everything
[1:40:51] I'm not leaving anything
[1:40:53] behind amen I'm taking everything amen
[1:40:57] it's like
[1:40:58] Moses he told Pharaoh he said Pharaoh
[1:41:01] we're taking
[1:41:02] everything am we're taking all the kids
[1:41:06] am we're taking all our animals amen
[1:41:09] even a single
[1:41:14] nail amen we're taking
[1:41:17] everything amen we're not leaving
[1:41:19] anything behind
[1:41:21] amen so that have to be our that have to
[1:41:23] be our
[1:41:25] mindset am you're not being selfish by
[1:41:27] doing that amen because that same
[1:41:31] word he's presented to
[1:41:33] everybody amen it's the same word that
[1:41:35] we
[1:41:36] hear but the result to it amen it's how
[1:41:41] much Faith you
[1:41:42] have amen and sometimes the results can
[1:41:45] be INS INS
[1:41:48] significant Amen to the human eye
[1:41:52] amen you can't even see
[1:41:53] it amen but the prophet says as soon as
[1:41:57] you say that
[1:42:00] prayer the result is
[1:42:03] there amen I'm going to read it
[1:42:06] here amen he said that when you
[1:42:10] say Mountain be
[1:42:15] moved and he still stands
[1:42:19] there you well it didn't
[1:42:23] happen oh it did
[1:42:26] happen amen when you say mountain
[1:42:29] move the prophet said that maybe one
[1:42:32] little significant grain of sand turned
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:40] loose amen out of the hundreds of
[1:42:43] billions and billions of
[1:42:45] tons amen one little Grand
[1:42:49] moved amen but begin to take
[1:42:52] place amen hold that
[1:42:56] faith and watch that mountain disappear
[1:43:00] certainly when you say Mountain be
[1:43:04] moved you don't have to see the entire
[1:43:06] Mountain started
[1:43:08] moving amen the prophet said that when
[1:43:10] you say
[1:43:11] that just a little
[1:43:14] Grand amen came out of that mountain
[1:43:17] amen he said I hold that faith amen
[1:43:21] because little by little amen you will
[1:43:24] see it coming take
[1:43:26] to amen thou shall say it in thy
[1:43:29] heart thisas move from my for my
[1:43:33] child thisas move from my body in the
[1:43:37] name of the Lord Jesus amen and don't
[1:43:40] doubt right there the good germ take on
[1:43:44] the new
[1:43:46] armor amen and a new
[1:43:49] weapon amen and and the enemy begins to
[1:43:52] back
[1:43:53] up amen he is
[1:43:55] defeated because Christ in the drinking
[1:43:59] of his his Mery
[1:44:02] Calvary amen defeated the devil and
[1:44:05] every one of his
[1:44:07] powers amen and he STS him of every
[1:44:10] everything he
[1:44:12] had amen and he has nothing but a he's

[1:44:18] bluff amen he can't go through it he
[1:44:20] can't he can't go through it he can't go
[1:44:22] through with
[1:44:23] it amen he'll do it we all
