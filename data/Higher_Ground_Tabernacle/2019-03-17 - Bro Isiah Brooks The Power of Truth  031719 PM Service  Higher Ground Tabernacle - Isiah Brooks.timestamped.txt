[25:35] [Music]
[25:45] oh hell man hallelujah praise him like
[26:16] you love him as we stand we'll be coming
[26:31] from Scripture that we are all familiar
[26:37] with Hebrews 13 and eight
[26:58] from Hebrews 13 and 8 we'll read st.
[27:01] John 3 2021 from there we'll go to
[27:10] Matthew 13 Hebrews 13 and 8 reads Jesus
[27:20] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[27:28] forever
[27:29] that means we're serving a god that
[27:32] cannot change st. John 3
[27:41] he told Israel hear ye o Israel I am a
[27:45] God that change is not he is who he is
[27:53] amen you love the Lord st. John 3 2021
[28:01] for every one that doeth evil hateth the
[28:05] light neither cometh to the light lest
[28:09] his deeds should be reproved but he that
[28:15] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[28:20] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[28:23] wrought in God one more scripture
[28:30] Matthew 13
[28:42] Matthew 13 beginning at the 10th verse
[28:53] and the disciples came and said unto him
[28:58] why speaketh thou unto them in parables
[29:01] he answered and said unto them because
[29:07] it is given unto you to know the
[29:09] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[29:13] to them it is not given for whosoever
[29:17] hath - excuse me for whosoever hath to
[29:20] him shall be given and he shall have
[29:24] more abundance but whosoever hath not
[29:27] from him shall be taken away even that
[29:32] he hath therefore speak to them in
[29:36] parables because they seeing see not
[29:40] hearing they hear not neither do they
[29:44] understand and there and in them is
[29:48] fulfilled the prophecies of Isaiah
[29:50] excuse me which saith by hearing ye ye
[29:54] shall hear and shall not understand and
[29:58] seeing ye shall see and shall not
[30:02] perceive let us pray Lord Jesus we thank
[30:07] you for your grace and your mercy we
[30:11] thank you for being so good to us this
[30:13] morning father we come as humbly as we
[30:17] know how
[30:19] realize Lord God that we are so unworthy
[30:22] within ourselves
[30:23] there's nothing or God that we could
[30:26] present to you this morning that would
[30:29] give us any kind of merit but because of
[30:32] your grace and because of your love
[30:35] because of your Holy Spirit Lord you
[30:37] have accounted us worthy and therefore
[30:39] we are accepted in you lord I pray
[30:42] hallelujah I pray this morning that you
[30:45] break and destroy the yokes of the enemy
[30:48] that you give us eyes to see and ears to
[30:52] hear
[30:53] and are hard to repent we ask these
[30:56] things in your lovely name Jesus Christ
[30:59] we pray amen
[31:01] you may be seated glad to have everybody
[31:07] this morning at one point in time I
[31:11] thought church was going to be half
[31:13] empty but you know I think God for your
[31:19] pressing your way out anyway I believe
[31:24] in worship I really believe in giving
[31:29] God my all I may not be able to achieve
[31:34] that every time but I do believe in
[31:38] giving him that understand when we do
[31:41] come to church we come to church to
[31:43] worship we come to church to fellowship
[31:48] and to hear from God this is where God
[31:51] has placed his word we realize Amen this
[31:57] morning that I've just been troubled and
[32:00] so many things has been going through my
[32:02] mind when God gave me this message I
[32:04] like to preach this morning the power of
[32:07] truth the power of truth we are living
[32:15] in what we call an erotic age where
[32:18] everybody's nerves seem to be taking
[32:21] advantage of them and they are insane
[32:25] most of the people are insane according
[32:28] to the men of God for the hour he said
[32:30] that the bride of Jesus Christ will be
[32:32] the only one that will have sanity
[32:34] people are insane you know a lot of
[32:38] people that are Christians are insane
[32:40] I I'm insane but in the right way I am
[32:46] I'm crazy about Jesus but there are
[32:50] those who are insane because they know
[32:53] and they have heard truth but they
[32:55] figure they have so much time or
[32:58] whatever I don't know what the issues
[33:00] are but I believe we are living in the
[33:04] last days
[33:06] I believe that almost all of the
[33:08] prophecies are have taken place and
[33:11] absolutely the bride of Jesus Christ
[33:13] could take a rapture at any given time
[33:17] we're living in a time where right is
[33:20] called wrong and wrong is called right
[33:25] most people say they want truth but
[33:28] truth is something else you know hmm
[33:31] when it comes to truth it's not always
[33:35] what you think it should be truth is God
[33:44] truth is like a hidden treasure you know
[33:48] it's very hard to find matter of fact
[33:53] the Word of God said few be that find it
[33:57] think about truth when we talk about
[34:03] truth truth holds everything in
[34:05] perspective it never changes no matter
[34:10] how much we change it never changes it
[34:18] will always remain the same because God
[34:23] is truth we declare that we are in this
[34:32] message we declare that we know truth
[34:36] but truth is not something that largest
[34:39] in your head is resting place is in the
[34:45] heart until truth lodges in the heart
[34:50] you really don't know it in other words
[34:53] that which is in your head can be taken
[34:55] away from you but when is in your heart
[34:59] it cannot be taken away the world today
[35:04] is in chaos the families is in moral
[35:10] decay why because when truth is rejected
[35:17] then people alone know
[35:20] who they are and are given up to their
[35:24] own beastly desires without truth people
[35:30] forget or just do not care who they are
[35:34] and then give themselves over to all
[35:39] kinds of affections that are against the
[35:41] nature you can find that in Romans 1:26
[35:48] and 27 if there ever was a time for
[35:55] truth it is today truth came to us 2,000
[36:02] years ago in the person of Jesus Christ
[36:07] don't you know the world have heard that
[36:10] name for thousands of years and many
[36:15] have not come to recognize that Jesus
[36:17] Christ is truth he is the truth of God
[36:27] outside of the first Adam he was the
[36:30] second Adam and we realized that Jesus
[36:38] Christ is the kind of man you and I are
[36:42] supposed to be he is true the Bible said
[36:49] in the the fullness of the Godhead
[36:51] bodily
[36:52] dwell in him oh we've heard this all
[36:56] that was in God he poured it into Christ
[37:00] and all that was in Christ he poured it
[37:03] into his church therefore Holy Spirit
[37:07] because there's only one Holy Spirit and
[37:11] when the Holy Spirit comes into a
[37:12] believer he becomes the incarnated
[37:16] Christ on come on somebody and
[37:20] collectively you and I collectively with
[37:27] the power of God in us we become
[37:30] omnipotent
[37:32] ah come on and when to UM impotence meet
[37:41] something has to happen that's why even
[37:46] when we come to church and I see such up
[37:49] stillness or deadness or starchiness I
[37:53] know that there is something wrong
[37:55] somewhere we have not been feeding off
[37:59] of truth enter his gates with
[38:02] Thanksgiving interest courts with praise
[38:05] that's true because you recognize and
[38:10] then they you have come amen to assembly
[38:14] where the Living God is going to show up
[38:16] I don't know about you but I just don't
[38:19] want the pillar of fire and then above
[38:22] the prophet's head i want the pill a
[38:24] fire to come and be seen among us I've
[38:29] seen it I'm a witness of it but people
[38:33] of God when God when we decide within
[38:37] ourselves that we want to see the
[38:39] manifestation of truth we will decide in
[38:43] ourselves
[38:44] Amen that we must be united and we must
[38:47] be one there will be a people in the
[38:52] world of chaos that will know who they
[38:58] are that's true they can be told truth
[39:06] even if it hurts and then believe it and
[39:12] they will act upon it hello I said again
[39:17] people who are up truth can receive
[39:21] truth even if it hurts they will hear it
[39:27] and then act upon it hallelujah
[39:34] truth will always remain the same the
[39:40] truth is when God saw you and I we were
[39:43] sons and daughters of God
[39:48] truth I'm not a beast I'm not just an
[39:54] animal I am a son of God and so are you
[40:00] if you feel with this Holy Spirit is
[40:06] that right listen no matter I'm coming
[40:09] to something in just a moment no matter
[40:12] where and what you do you should always
[40:16] tell the truth when you fail to tell the
[40:22] truth you are allowing yourself to
[40:28] engage with trouble if need you even if
[40:34] you believe a lie you are embracing
[40:42] trouble so why are you going with this
[40:46] brother Brooks because I want you to
[40:47] understand the Bible said Jesus Christ
[40:49] was full of grace and truth
[40:55] truth in itself stands alone majority of
[41:04] the people do not follow truth truth is
[41:09] only found by a minority search the
[41:14] Scriptures the majority has always been
[41:19] wrong whether it be sinner or the
[41:25] so-called Christian think about it when
[41:32] Satan came to even Adam as a serpent
[41:37] what did he do he broke truth and he
[41:46] presented Allah and that is why we are
[41:51] living the way we're living now because
[41:54] of a lie
[41:57] is that right
[41:59] say God will not you will not surely die
[42:03] if you break the Word of God you will
[42:05] not surely die and that's what the devil
[42:07] is telling a lot of us oh you can do it
[42:11] the way you want to but if you break the
[42:13] word you will die truth never changes
[42:19] the only reason why we're not lying
[42:22] laying in the graves aware is because of
[42:25] grace with God have unmerited favor
[42:29] toward us because of election because he
[42:34] chose us you didn't show choose God God
[42:37] chose you it is okay you know you must
[42:45] understand that truth is not given to
[42:49] everybody since the fall Amen God does
[42:55] not give truth to everybody hello he
[43:01] highs truth from some and reveals it to
[43:07] others you understand me
[43:12] and you say well what do you mean
[43:14] brother words what are you saying I'm
[43:16] saying this Bible is truth from cover to
[43:22] cover it is the true Word of God and the
[43:29] Bible says that heaven and earth will
[43:31] pass away but the word of the Lord shall
[43:35] stand boom so if we're going to have
[43:43] eternal life we must stand on the word
[43:48] you know when you speak truth it'll get
[43:52] you in trouble truth will always get you
[43:58] in trouble
[44:00] hallelujah now you said what brother I'm
[44:02] a Christian and I tell truth all the
[44:04] time and I don't get in trouble
[44:07] well something's wrong somewhere because
[44:11] whatever you tell the truth somebody's
[44:13] got to dislike it somebody is going to
[44:17] disagree with you
[44:19] hallelujah and you must understand that
[44:22] you must tell the truth no liar we're
[44:28] entering to the kingdom hello
[44:31] no liar will enter into the kingdom till
[44:36] I say it again no liar will enter into
[44:40] the kingdom of God hallelujah I'm
[44:45] getting ready to go back to the fact
[44:47] that the kingdom of God is a mystery and
[44:57] only God can revealed that mystery
[45:04] you're Hibbing
[45:05] and most of the time you know God always
[45:09] set this Bible in such a way to knock
[45:12] theologians can figure it out they can
[45:15] have the doctors of divinity and still
[45:17] not know God study for eight years get
[45:24] that great degrees and still won't know
[45:28] God because the kingdom of God is
[45:32] something that is revealed is that all
[45:41] right
[45:42] you and I must understand that the truth
[45:46] has the scripture says according to st.
[45:48] John II will make you free see I know
[45:53] some of y'all don't know what truth is
[45:55] cuz hardly any of y'all have Amen the
[45:57] word when the word is true is a man the
[46:02] unloader has believers and don't you
[46:06] realize Amen that when you sit still and
[46:08] don't Amen the word you're not resisting
[46:11] me you're resisting God and that's truth
[46:15] don't expect to get nothing out of a
[46:18] service if you don't put nothing in it
[46:23] the chairs has a way of saying Amen
[46:29] better than some of these people truth
[46:34] shall make you free
[46:39] that right we are Abraham's seed that's
[46:45] what everybody says we are in Abraham
[46:48] see but and understand we've never been
[46:51] in bondage religious folks said to Jesus
[46:59] we are Abraham's seed and we never been
[47:04] in bondage talking to the word talking
[47:08] to God himself
[47:10] evidently they were under our illusion
[47:14] they were under a lie because Jesus
[47:19] could have gone all the way back in time
[47:21] and show them that even since the fall
[47:26] you've been in bondage not just a Jew
[47:29] the Gentile as well and whether we
[47:36] realize it or not and then when you
[47:38] cannot come in here and worship God you
[47:41] are in bondage we are please unfold your
[47:46] arms you and I must understand it meant
[47:53] that when you and I come to church and
[47:55] then we come to be free the Bible said
[47:57] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[48:00] Liberty your body speaks that's the only
[48:03] reason why I'm saying it your body
[48:05] speaks you lockdown and you and I must
[48:10] understand by God's grace and then that
[48:13] we are here to be free how are we going
[48:15] to make a rapture do you think that God
[48:20] is going to dismiss everything is as all
[48:22] well they didn't live it but I love them
[48:26] anyway it's not going to be that way
[48:29] the power of the blood must make us live
[48:32] it and if you can't love me you cannot
[48:36] love
[48:38] if I can't love you I can't love God
[48:41] because God is love in this oh I'm
[48:47] getting ready to have a good time this
[48:48] morning
[48:51] see you because if the Sun who the Sun
[48:55] sets free is free indeed hallelujah
[48:59] you see I'm free at home I'm free when
[49:02] I'm out in the streets I'm free when I
[49:05] comes into the church I'm free my
[49:10] worship I'm just all worship now my
[49:13] worship it's not hinging upon nobody
[49:17] else I worship when nobody else is
[49:22] around I worship
[49:24] hallelujah help me Lord you see you and
[49:28] I must understand that we're living if
[49:31] we are the bride and I believe we are we
[49:34] just need to get rid of the trash we've
[49:37] got too much stuff in our lives and we
[49:39] must get rid of the trash because it is
[49:43] the trash that keeps us down hallelujah
[49:48] if you cannot come to church and get
[49:51] stimulated by the revelation of this
[49:57] word there is something wrong with you
[50:03] you can be a rich man a poor man a
[50:07] beggar man thief but if you drink the
[50:12] natural wine it's going to stimulate you
[50:16] and the Word of God amen quicken is the
[50:21] stimulation when that revelation strike
[50:25] you on who you are listen I am free the
[50:28] devastate urine bodies I told him tell
[50:30] him I am free hallelujah whom the son
[50:40] make free I like mate is the word that
[50:42] means to construct or create hallelujah
[50:46] set free means to put lay or stand you
[50:50] know I set
[50:51] is over there but when I make something
[50:53] I'm creating it
[50:54] he creates me free hallelujah he creates
[51:02] me free not that's truth hallelujah
[51:09] think about it God has always you're not
[51:14] living in a time where the delusion and
[51:17] the deception is so great we've got
[51:20] thousands upon thousands of Christians
[51:22] going to church
[51:23] thinking they're going to make a rapture
[51:27] and most Christian can't even take
[51:30] correction how dare you most Christians
[51:39] don't like you to tell them the truth
[51:40] but if you're born of truth you love to
[51:45] even if it hurts you love it
[51:48] because that's what you are all about my
[51:56] momma used to tell me because I know
[51:58] every child would lie sometimes my mama
[52:00] when she lives she says you know if you
[52:02] lie you steal and she was telling the
[52:08] truth if you lie you will still buy it
[52:13] just doesn't stop there
[52:15] the devil just doesn't let you do one
[52:17] Shin think about it I want to bring you
[52:20] the truth of Adam and Eve misplaced one
[52:25] word broke one word by believing a lie
[52:30] and look where the fruits of that has
[52:35] placed us in this day truth is rare and
[52:41] this world is so mixed up and then they
[52:44] call it right wrong and wrong right
[52:46] a man don't know he's a man and a woman
[52:49] no no she's a woman now people think is
[52:52] their beast and they are without the
[52:56] Holy Ghost that's what you are and
[52:58] you're gonna do whatever you feel like
[53:03] doing
[53:04] if truth is not there hello
[53:09] this Bible is our guide line I was
[53:14] telling somebody the other day a friend
[53:16] of mine I was talking to I said don't
[53:19] you know that a football game got lost
[53:22] a football game got rules you you can't
[53:27] just do what you want to do in football
[53:29] and expect to win you got boundaries
[53:34] you can't run all the way up into the
[53:36] bleachers get to the goal line you can't
[53:40] do it
[53:41] baseball has rules regulations things
[53:46] that will make you a better athlete
[53:48] y'all know what I'm saying that's why
[53:51] God had rules to make us better
[53:55] Christians
[53:56] oh come on somebody it's true the woman
[54:03] at the well she had been taught all
[54:08] kinds of things this woman a man no
[54:13] doubt was a backslidden Christian of
[54:14] some sort and she was at a place Amen
[54:22] where she was coming in the evening Amen
[54:26] to get a drink of water and who was
[54:31] there Jesus see one thing about truth is
[54:37] this if you were in the mind of God from
[54:40] the foundation of the world you will be
[54:43] with him he will find a way to catch up
[54:49] with you no matter where is that
[54:54] hallelujah
[54:55] I've heard of people getting saved in a
[54:58] nightclub cuz a backslidden Christian
[55:01] witness to see God knows what he's doing
[55:07] he said I have I have never lost one
[55:13] the thing that's really shaking me in
[55:15] minutes because I see the time I see
[55:17] when we're living 1963 go 1957
[55:23] indictment and look at us now
[55:29] this ain't just the United States it's
[55:33] all over the world and people who are
[55:37] called by if you don't fight you will be
[55:41] left behind y'all better hear me if you
[55:46] don't press because the pressure is
[55:49] great but you realize what's been told
[55:53] us only a few he said maybe as many of
[55:58] them on one hand
[55:59] we'll make a rapture y'all hear me this
[56:07] is not playing trash it's about living
[56:10] it let me let me move on but here was
[56:13] this woman a man she comes a men and
[56:16] she's looking and she's coming to get a
[56:19] drink of water and here Jesus's woman go
[56:21] give me drink she's seeing that he was a
[56:24] Jew
[56:28] what's disturbed about him asking her
[56:32] for water because there was a
[56:35] segregation between the Jew and the
[56:39] Samaritan hello just like it is now
[56:43] everywhere you go there's racial walls
[56:47] everywhere you can be over there
[56:49] inherent in the narrow countries and
[56:52] they still got the same thing hallelujah
[56:57] after a while and to be skinny against
[56:59] that because that's the way the devil
[57:03] works he sees differences in people and
[57:07] he makes those differences laws and
[57:10] rules and the Bible said we are all of
[57:14] one blood I'm telling you
[57:19] knowing this message is not going to
[57:21] save you living this message saves you
[57:26] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[57:33] it's the life in this message it's the
[57:36] life in this blood it meant that saves
[57:39] you not by what any man can both I've
[57:43] done this I've done that but have you
[57:46] received the Holy Ghost since you
[57:48] believe that power of God that makes a
[57:52] drunkard Amen a saint that makes a
[57:55] prostitute halt again that same one Amen
[57:59] there open the eyes of the blind is
[58:01] living here today I've seen it I've seen
[58:07] the dead raised twice I've seen cancer
[58:10] healed I've seen all kinds of miracles
[58:13] hallelujah but that just doesn't excite
[58:17] me the way it used to because I realized
[58:19] you can see all of that and still be
[58:22] lost the thing that excites me is when I
[58:25] see God taking control of me and
[58:28] producing faith producing virtue and
[58:31] producing knowledge and temperance and
[58:34] bringing me on up to a place where I
[58:36] cast out all fear because perfect love
[58:41] casts out all fear
[58:45] this okay
[58:47] Amen go get me the drink hallelujah
[58:52] jesus said if you knew stood before you
[58:55] you ask him ask me for a drink
[58:58] wanna go get your husband I have nothing
[59:01] she said he said you correct you've had
[59:04] five and the one you have is not your
[59:06] own hallelujah
[59:08] so what was he doing he was designing he
[59:10] was trying to let her see I'm more than
[59:12] just a man somebody help me here Jesus
[59:16] Christ was more than just a man but he
[59:20] was God manifested in the flesh and he's
[59:25] the same brother today as he was
[59:28] yesterday
[59:29] ha hallelujah that means he's doing the
[59:32] same thing
[59:33] he's always done but he needs somebody
[59:36] to believe it somebody to receive it is
[59:42] that right I wasn't just born to be a
[59:44] man but I was born to be a southern of
[59:47] God you've been born to be a son of God
[59:50] or a daughter of God this is what he
[59:53] says see that mountain over there if you
[59:58] say to this mountain be thou move and
[1:00:01] believe it and receive it that little
[1:00:06] mountain will move he put it there
[1:00:11] he said mountain because he knows only
[1:00:14] his kind only his kind will believe it
[1:00:23] in the natural mind you say well he was
[1:00:28] just being figurative he really didn't
[1:00:32] mean mountains he really saying well if
[1:00:35] it's a big problem no he meant mountain
[1:00:43] if he told Moses stretch out your rod
[1:00:46] and the Red Sea backed up hallelujah if
[1:00:50] the if they crossed the Jordan on dry
[1:00:53] land if he sad manner drop matter out of
[1:00:57] heaven to feed millions he meant
[1:01:01] mountain but where's the faith the Bible
[1:01:10] says when the Son of Man comes shall he
[1:01:13] find faith that means deep faith the
[1:01:16] faith that was once delivered unto the
[1:01:19] Saints that faith that believed that
[1:01:22] Jesus Christ is God and will always
[1:01:25] remain God that faith that believed that
[1:01:28] Jesus Christ imparted his own Holy
[1:01:30] Spirit into the believer and they have
[1:01:33] become his body somebody help me here
[1:01:37] because no man have seen God until he
[1:01:40] see God in you
[1:01:45] you can't we see the great picture see
[1:01:51] we're not just worms crawling around
[1:01:54] somewhere we are the attributes of God
[1:01:58] this thing is no mistake or some
[1:02:02] happening like some evolution all those
[1:02:11] evolutionists people if they just would
[1:02:13] tall's for a moment to think they'll
[1:02:16] realize how ridiculous they sound to
[1:02:21] think that you came from a Polliwog a
[1:02:25] tadpole where did the tadpole come from
[1:02:30] hallelujah like somebody said if there
[1:02:33] was a big bang two big old rocks coming
[1:02:36] together whatever they were where the de
[1:02:38] rocks come from and what made them a
[1:02:42] marvel I'm marveled at comets those
[1:02:47] comments that's been in the air in the
[1:02:49] sky how long has been they've been there
[1:02:51] and having lost speed at all they still
[1:02:56] going and going and going huh every year
[1:03:01] they come around about the same time and
[1:03:03] nobody knows where the motor is
[1:03:07] wow it's God behind it if God can keep a
[1:03:12] rock afloat evening where there is
[1:03:15] nothing but space what about you and I
[1:03:18] we need more to God than the rocks but
[1:03:21] he said if you don't praise me I will
[1:03:24] cause the rocks to cry out absolutely
[1:03:30] hallelujah see we're like a byproduct
[1:03:35] created beings by holy wedlock did y'all
[1:03:39] know that that when you receive the Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost
[1:03:41] it's a wedlock with God you married to
[1:03:47] him from that point on you are his wife
[1:03:49] hallelujah that means if I'm the wife of
[1:03:52] God I can't act the way I want to act I
[1:03:54] just can't do the things I
[1:03:56] to do I must be the wife of a holy God
[1:04:01] so everything I do and must do must be a
[1:04:06] compliment to him and his character I'm
[1:04:10] gonna say it again everything that I do
[1:04:13] and must do must be a compliment to his
[1:04:17] character
[1:04:18] did y'all know that in the Old Testament
[1:04:21] when King Ahaz aura a man called for his
[1:04:25] wife Bess died she was beautiful
[1:04:28] huh she was one of the prettiest women
[1:04:30] if not the most beautiful woman in that
[1:04:32] in that Kingdom but guess what she had
[1:04:36] bad character huh is that truth she
[1:04:41] wanted to show herself off instead of
[1:04:43] Christ instead of the king you
[1:04:45] understand me
[1:04:46] she wanted to show herself off and
[1:04:49] because she would not come when the King
[1:04:52] called her he divorced her he got rid of
[1:04:57] her hallelujah but there's a one little
[1:05:02] young girl by the name of Esther and
[1:05:08] Esther could care nothing about
[1:05:12] appearance other than what she knew the
[1:05:16] King light see that's what I'm saying we
[1:05:20] dress according to the way we know the
[1:05:22] King liked it hallelujah it's not about
[1:05:27] me it's all about him is that right
[1:05:32] r-truth and you and I must understand
[1:05:37] that if we dressed to call someone to
[1:05:40] lust it is not the Holy Spirit it is the
[1:05:46] devil because he is the one that causes
[1:05:47] people to lust hallelujah we supposed to
[1:05:53] be in his likeness in his unity in the
[1:05:58] perfect image of the Living God because
[1:06:01] we become sons and daughters not
[1:06:04] separated but the same spirit
[1:06:08] same God the same person join in well up
[1:06:12] to the Eternal Spirit right hallelujah
[1:06:17] see how God planted in had that he we
[1:06:20] should not be a different but him not
[1:06:24] some other being of some other try but a
[1:06:27] real union in offspring of the Almighty
[1:06:30] God that after truth we're supposed to
[1:06:35] be that way
[1:06:35] we supposed to be pressing into it Lord
[1:06:38] I'm not there yet but help me that's all
[1:06:41] I'm saying
[1:06:42] God help me grow up into you my brother
[1:06:47] from California called me yesterday cuz
[1:06:50] he's a very tall handsome man even in
[1:06:54] the 70s and when I was a boy they used
[1:06:58] to say you look just like your brother
[1:06:59] so it made me feel really it makes me
[1:07:04] feel really good because I knew he was a
[1:07:07] good-looking fella and I'm thinking you
[1:07:09] know I'm looking like him you know it's
[1:07:10] okay
[1:07:11] and all of a sudden my jeans kicked in
[1:07:15] my daddy jeans and my whole and if you
[1:07:20] saw pictures of what I look anyway my
[1:07:23] jeans kicked in anyway my brother says
[1:07:25] at what age he says he's yesterday and
[1:07:28] what age did you you you turn into your
[1:07:30] your father's image I said I don't know
[1:07:33] but I did realize I was looking
[1:07:36] different now I'm saying this because my
[1:07:40] genes dictate it to me on what I was
[1:07:49] going to look like and we had a good
[1:07:52] anyway it's a long story
[1:07:53] but the point is there's no way to get
[1:07:56] out of it that's why you gotta be born
[1:08:00] again if you're born again you've done
[1:08:03] just what God wants you to do and when
[1:08:05] the life of God begins to grow in you it
[1:08:08] will form and shape you into the very
[1:08:12] image of God because that seed in you is
[1:08:16] the seed of God nobody can stop it
[1:08:21] somebody help me here God doesn't give
[1:08:26] back to image ah immature babies every
[1:08:33] child of God goes through its full term
[1:08:37] hey somebody help me here that's how it
[1:08:43] is with God don't get discouraged
[1:08:45] don't let the devil make you feel like
[1:08:47] you is you oh how can I say it it's not
[1:08:51] that power not by might but by my spirit
[1:08:55] saith the Lord don't come and track
[1:08:58] feeling condemned into his gates y'all
[1:09:02] understand what I'm saying
[1:09:03] don't come in here feeling down because
[1:09:06] you realize when you get here you better
[1:09:08] to get here you got here and the victory
[1:09:12] is yours hallelujah you love the Lord on
[1:09:22] the day of Pentecost when that Holy
[1:09:24] Spirit came down and broke up to 120
[1:09:28] pieces feel the house where they were
[1:09:31] sitting
[1:09:31] I don't even know how the chairs worth
[1:09:34] feeling but you know they had to feel
[1:09:35] the presence I don't know see what we
[1:09:40] don't realize that even trees feel the
[1:09:43] presence of God the leaves clap their
[1:09:47] hair hallelujah when that breeze come by
[1:09:53] you know I love to see perishing I love
[1:09:56] to hear them sing right cuz they don't
[1:09:58] care whether you like the music or not
[1:10:03] they go up and down and no they just
[1:10:06] have a good time and look like they
[1:10:09] think you bother them when you disturb
[1:10:11] them
[1:10:12] don't you see me praising God why are
[1:10:16] you bothering me hallelujah and that's
[1:10:20] the way we ought to be in service forget
[1:10:23] about everybody else it's between you
[1:10:26] and God
[1:10:26] Oh Lord I don't even know I keep going
[1:10:29] there but my point is Amen this is true
[1:10:34] truth is in the cap hallelujah the king
[1:10:37] is in the camp and when the king is in
[1:10:39] the cap there's a lot of noise
[1:10:41] hallelujah there is somebody don't let
[1:10:46] him make you starchy not at a time like
[1:10:49] this none of us are perfect all of us
[1:10:52] make mistakes but thanks be to God that
[1:10:55] we have been accepted is that beloved
[1:10:58] it's not the power not by might but by
[1:11:01] my spirit saith the Lord truth shall
[1:11:05] make you free and he whom the Sun is set
[1:11:10] free it's free indeed is that right Paul
[1:11:16] say don't even go back into the yoke of
[1:11:17] bondage hallelujah I know we want to
[1:11:21] live right but don't let the devil just
[1:11:23] condemn your minds and so because you
[1:11:26] make mistakes somebody help me here
[1:11:28] because if you let him condemn you you
[1:11:31] are entering back into bondage I'm not
[1:11:37] worthy none of us are this is the grace
[1:11:40] of God I'm talking about this is truth
[1:11:43] hallelujah and because I understand this
[1:11:46] grace and I know that His grace has
[1:11:48] personally been given to me you must
[1:11:51] know that
[1:11:54] hallelujah ha
[1:11:56] the Bible says into the straight gate
[1:11:59] for wide is the gate broad is the way
[1:12:01] that leads to destruction and many there
[1:12:05] be which go in thereat now I'm going to
[1:12:09] say some things think about all the mega
[1:12:11] churches out here that's the broad way
[1:12:14] everybody that goes to the church really
[1:12:17] goes there to be saved I'm not saying
[1:12:20] they're not saved but I will say this as
[1:12:22] long as they remain there they will not
[1:12:25] make a rapture hello the word must be
[1:12:30] unadulterated it must be pure
[1:12:33] it cannot be manhandled you understand
[1:12:38] me you and I must understand that's why
[1:12:41] God said according to Revelation come
[1:12:43] out of her my people and be not
[1:12:45] partakers of her sins yah him
[1:12:48] because what you you said Oh what when
[1:12:51] you see the fruit that's what kind of
[1:12:52] tree it is hmm
[1:12:57] now I'm gonna say this but Strait is the
[1:13:01] gate and narrow is the way which leadeth
[1:13:05] unto life and few there be that find it
[1:13:10] now have you found it have you found it
[1:13:23] hmm think about it you could have been
[1:13:26] out there most of us was out there but
[1:13:30] you see it wasn't a preacher the way he
[1:13:32] preached that drew me to Christ it was
[1:13:35] something in the inside that when he
[1:13:38] would preach I heard truth it was the
[1:13:40] truth that set me free I can say all
[1:13:46] these things I can tell you you
[1:13:48] justified before the foundation all I
[1:13:50] can tell you elected in all these things
[1:13:51] but let me tell you something until that
[1:13:54] becomes a truth to you not in your head
[1:13:56] but in your heart you are to be the
[1:14:00] manifestation of the word that Malachi 4
[1:14:03] preached manifested manifestation of
[1:14:08] Luke 17 30 manifestation of revelation
[1:14:12] 10 7 hallelujah is that all right God
[1:14:19] cannot lie how many I believe that the
[1:14:22] Bible said he swore by himself
[1:14:24] Abraham I'ma make this thing happen who
[1:14:29] Abraham and Sarah oh and God said you
[1:14:33] gonna have a baby whoo
[1:14:35] a granny is gonna have a baby
[1:14:39] oh grandma but he didn't tell him
[1:14:43] everything because he wanted to see how
[1:14:46] much they could believe what he told him
[1:14:48] see God don't tell you everything
[1:14:51] God will just tell you how faith believe
[1:14:54] what I said and I bring it to pass we
[1:14:57] didn't know he didn't know I'll say
[1:14:58] laughs you know just like some of us
[1:15:00] right now we're laugh
[1:15:01] in the sense because we said Lord I'm in
[1:15:03] such bad shape I'm old high in the world
[1:15:05] I'm gonna produce Christ hallelujah hey
[1:15:09] man another problem says why did Sarah
[1:15:13] laugh she said no I didn't she said yes
[1:15:15] you did you lied and God would have
[1:15:20] killed her right then but because she
[1:15:22] was Abraham's wife hallelujah how many
[1:15:27] times we made mistakes how many times we
[1:15:29] have lied don't tell me you haven't oh

[1:15:46] Christian amen
[1:15:51] the Holy Ghost get you say no go make it
[1:15:53] right hello
[1:15:58] but God cannot lie he doesn't make that
[1:16:03] kind of a spits mistake now in God chose
[1:16:07] you and elected you before the
[1:16:09] foundation of the world how can you be
[1:16:11] lost you know what the thing about it is
[1:16:16] sometimes we think that Satan got an
[1:16:17] upper hand Satan don't have the probably
[1:16:28] God said when we weakest Saint get down
[1:16:30] on his knees the devil tremble and I
[1:16:34] told the Lord the other day I says Lord
[1:16:36] I'd rather be the weakest Saint on earth
[1:16:39] than to be a non-believer hmm yeah happy
[1:16:46] though I'd rather be the weakest one
[1:16:48] then they say I don't believe it because
[1:16:54] even in my weakness huh I'm strong
[1:17:01] is that Alright it's the truth the truth
[1:17:06] is in Jesus Christ he said if you
[1:17:11] believe on me as the scripture have said
[1:17:14] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[1:17:17] living water that is the truth that's
[1:17:21] why you can't happen to be happy
[1:17:23] sometime that's why the joy overflows
[1:17:25] because you believed on him and that
[1:17:28] water is flowing out of you
[1:17:32] living waters that means you have
[1:17:36] already passed from death unto life you

[1:29:09] Lord I said if I've ever had in the
[1:29:11] jealousy I've never never desired to be
[1:29:14] a prophet or anything like that but I am
[1:29:19] I said Lord the relationship you had
[1:29:21] with the Prophet I do get jealous not in
[1:29:26] a bad way but in a good way
[1:29:30] you said I'm saying look at Paul even
[1:29:33] Paul says I am a prisoner of Christ how
[1:29:36] many of us can say that today that was
[1:29:39] an intimate relationship to Paul was so
[1:29:44] in love with Christ he could not disobey
[1:29:47] Him even when it came to being whooped
[1:29:51] and beaten and shipwrecked and wherever
[1:29:54] the angel call says don't get off the
[1:29:57] ship it's gonna wreck what you bought
[1:29:58] you stop you know most of us say Lord is
[1:30:02] that you don't get all if you get off
[1:30:07] the ship your dodj stay on the ship it's
[1:30:09] going direct but everybody will be
[1:30:12] saying that's when you bind when you are
[1:30:16] so connected with Christ it meant that
[1:30:18] you can hear him and know that it's his
[1:30:20] voice he said my sheep hear my voice and
[1:30:23] a stranger they will not follow listen
[1:30:26] I'm saying this in closing whatever and
[1:30:28] I
[1:30:28] the rest tonight whatever you do try to
[1:30:31] stay as truthful as you possibly can and
[1:30:34] if there are things in your life that
[1:30:37] you have lied about you need to make
[1:30:38] them right it might hurt but it'll do
[1:30:46] you good
[1:30:48] you love the Lord there were so many
[1:30:51] things I couldn't even hardly sleep last
[1:30:53] night and this morning I've been
[1:30:56] thinking about this message I said lord
[1:30:57] I don't know how you're gonna do it
[1:30:58] because there's so many things it could
[1:31:01] have been broadened so many things that
[1:31:03] have been coming to my mind and my heart
[1:31:05] not on just to preach but to me to me to
[1:31:08] me you know one thing I do not I do not
[1:31:11] want to be someone who deceives himself
[1:31:14] hello
[1:31:16] ain't no using you saying you got the
[1:31:18] Holy Ghost that if you don't see the
[1:31:19] fruits of it mmm I'm not saying you're
[1:31:26] not a tree that can bear it but you got
[1:31:29] to have it and you ought to see Christ
[1:31:32] somewhere in your life even in your
[1:31:35] failure you need to see Jesus my
[1:31:39] thoughts is by God's grace don't denied
[1:31:41] truth we're not see people said well
[1:31:45] brother books aren't you a Christian yes
[1:31:47] but we're not like everybody else and
[1:31:50] what I'm preaching is not local this is
[1:31:53] a universal message and God has
[1:31:56] preaching the same message all over the
[1:31:59] world
[1:32:01] everybody's got their little just like
[1:32:04] you had Matthew Mark Luke and John they
[1:32:06] all preach their angle of the message
[1:32:09] but when you put it all together it
[1:32:12] brings in one beautiful picture that's
[1:32:16] what people need to start seeing it
[1:32:17] ain't number one picture or one portrait
[1:32:21] and that portrait is Jesus Christ
[1:32:23] himself lest an
[1:32:36] Oh

[1:35:52] has to see and when I see spirits that's
[1:35:56] what I hit spirits I just know that if
[1:36:02] you give God the right protocol you can
[1:36:05] get whatever you want from here the
[1:36:08] scripture tells us how to do it
