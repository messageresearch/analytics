TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I trust you're here for a good time hey man where we enjoy being in the presence of the Lord don't we hey man so let's just get right into the word of the Lord to passage of scriptures I'd like to read from this morning like to read or preach message on tithes and offerings amen amen but it's really Bowl up there's a lot more to it than just tithes and offerings amens ice oh I struggled to put a title to this message because there's so much to it amen so let's let's turn order 1st Corinthians chapter 4 amen 1st corinthians chapter 4 we'll read from the sixth verse through the tenth verse and then from there we'll go to Genesis chapter 12 it says st. Paul speaking he says and these things brethren I having a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo's for your sake that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against the other for what maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou dis receive it why does thou glory as if thou has not received it now here full now you're rich you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God that ye did reign that we also might reign with you for I think that God has set us forth us Parcells apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle under the world and to angels into milk for we are fools for Christ's sake but year why is in Christ we are weak but ye are strong year honorable but we are despised amen us go to Genesis chapter 12 you know God's patterns they do not change amen just as 12 will read the first through the third verse and says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I'll make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and I'll make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing I'll bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed let's just power has no word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for for this day in this message door that you give unto us Lord Lord you have not left us without a witness Lord well here in our present day Lord you've given us a messenger father Lord you've given us a message that we could cling on cling ahold to Lord and for that we thank you father we thank you for all that you have done for us though for the patterns you've put in place for the systems and for the government's you've given to us Lord for the the ways that you have made us so we the supernatural beings here on the earth can come into a place and hear from you father Lauren we want to thank you for that for that ability father to hear from you Laura for you did not leave us alone you do not leave us without a witness but Lord you gave us your voice father and I just thank you Lord for all things and when we just turn this entire service over into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen so I just wanted to start off here with speaking about Abraham you know Abraham knows I I know I've testified several times about a man that was it's chastising me for believing on predestination one time as we were talking me in this me and this man and and I asked him I was like well you know he was talking about you know when do you get saved at what point you give you saved he didn't believe in predestination I said well when was Abraham saved you know and I just I like to think about that way because I'm a child of Abraham amen the Bible declares that I am a child of Abraham so however it was the Abraham got saved that must be the way that I got saved amen in the Bible you know the you know Abraham he didn't get saved when he met Macca's dick hey then he wasn't saved when he paid tithes to milk isn't it Amen he wasn't saved when he had a son Isaac he didn't he didn't become saved when when when God called him out of the Chaldees no but he was saved before the foundation of the world God had his hand upon his life amen and God had been watching that that seed gone down through generation and to generation and through generation amen all his father's before him had certain peculiarities but when it got to Abraham that blend became just right Amen God had a man upon the earth that had certain characteristics that could express something that God wanted to be expressed amen and God allowed that to come into you know everything that came from Abraham's mother and fragrance brother they all joined together in one body at one place at one time in the body of Abraham a man that had certain peculiarities that he could believe God and God carried to him as righteousness amen so now and I don't know what you know Abraham you know and he when God called him you know I think about says he's about 75 years old or whatever it was God called him out of ur of Chaldees and God called him out of his father's house amen but as soon as God called him his life was changed Amen I don't know how Abraham grew up I don't know what his what his childhood was like I don't know what he spent did the first 70 years of his life or so I do not know but I do know that all of a sudden at some point in time that God Himself came and started talking to him now that's a blessing not everybody in this world gets that Amen but for some reason there was something about Abraham that God was able to come down and parse through all the foolishness of the world around him all the false gods all the false worship services all the heathen traits God is able to part through that dark cloud and come down and speak directly to her hell that's a blessing Abraham was a blessed man because he was a man that God could speak to a man I trusted that the men and women here are the same caliber sons and daughters of Abraham a men who can have the foolishness of this world tip the clouds of Laodicea to be parted to where God can come down and speak to you amen it's a blessing to have God be able to speak to you did you know that God wants to speak to us God wants to be able to speak his word and haven't come down and come down through the sound waves into your ears and when it hits your ears your mind starts processing and the spirit within you receives it and says yes and amen and abraham believed God as in tributed it to him as righteousness amen attributed to his righteousness he believed the word of God and it was attributed to him as righteousness and you are now Abraham stinson daughter so therefore we must believe God and it's attributed to us as righteousness holiness how many would like to be righteous how many like to be white and pure upon that day a man whom we like to have their garments white was spotless without wrinkle without blemish a then on that day when he has come that's what he's coming he's coming for our bride des with our spa without Rico amen and when you believe the Word of God he attributes it to you as righteousness because you are a son daughter of Abraham what a blessing Amen what a blessing so Abraham when he received this call in Genesis chapter 12 it changed his life he was a changed man he couldn't be what he was before he had to forsake all he forsook all now remember we're sons and daughters of Abraham amen now now a lot of people they try to this Christian journey and they want to see if they can you could do the Christian walk while holding on to the things of the pastor that's human nature amen that's not Abraham nature that's human nature amen human nature dictates that we will want to try to walk both paths at the same time human nature will want to try to serve God come to church while also holding a few things back so we could serve our our mind wants us to do that's human nature we haven't called to be humans we're not called we're not called to be humans God said that those that believe on his name - then he be gave power to become sons and daughters of God through the believing on his name if you receive power to become sons and daughters of God you have to reject being sons and daughters of the flesh a meant to be a son or daughter of Abraham you have to reject being the son or daughter of the human race amen so Abraham forsook all and he started wandering now now remember he had an inheritance of his father he had an inheritance of his father well he had to forsake that inheritance amen he forsook all he had to leave things behind he had to leave behind things behind that he had seen other men receive inheritances from their father he knew in his mind that as men get old they die and they leave whatever they have possessed throughout their life whether it be Hertz or land or gold or silver or wherever it is that they passed down that those children would get that inheritance from their father amens but Abraham as he was due to get an inheritance from his father Terah forsook all of his inheritance and followed after the word of Jesus Christ because he can't because he was given a promise of a better inheritance and so when he saw that there is he took the two inheritances the inheritance of his father Terah and the inheritance of his creator Jehovah and he counted the inheritance of his father Jehovah to be greater the inheritance of his father terribly a man so he rejected the one and followed after that and he left his father's household behind and he believed on the Lord Jesus Christ he believed on the word of Jehovah he believed on the name of Jehovah and was attributed unto him as righteousness he received the inheritance that righteousness became was the was the was the seal of his inheritance amen it was given to him as a nerts when he gained that righteousness everything else was coming right along amen amen he forsook all now remember he was quite away he became poor so he might become rich the Bible says a little bit later on that when when Abraham came into the promised land and God said wherever you tread upon this is all yours amen remember that there was a drought in the land and he was driven down to Egypt for a period of time and when he came back he was a Bible said as he was a rich man and then he was a rich man he had all kinds of her cattle and sheep amen he had gold and silver he had men servants women servants he had a large entourage that followed him amen when Abraham came into town it wasn't just him it was an entire city that came with a man entire camp of of these nomads that were going about the land because they knew this was their land amen and there go from place to place this is our land amen and so when Abraham came to town he came to town with a lot of stuff amen why because the Bible says he had become a rich man amen he had been rich he became poor he forsook all and but his his real father Jehovah gave him an inheritance that was greater than all amen now and now remember the November because because he forsook all he first took all the traits of his father they meant his father worshiped idols right he forsook all that he forsook all the traits of his father he first sucked all the all of his past and received the traits of his new father the Creator Jehovah there wasn't his new father BOE's revealed unto him that this was his father amen it was revealed unto Abraham that joy that Jehovah was his creator and was his father amen and he forsook all to follow after that amen and now by that he started displaying the attributes of his father Jehovah Amen so when his brother lot was captured how he remembers the story amen amen the the the his the his brother lot was captured him and all his family and they were taken off to a far-off country and Abraham says I'm going after amen and so he goes he goes and he goes he gives his three hundred of his servants weapons and they go and they follow after a lot and they're gonna save him they're gonna deliver amen and they're gonna bring him back safely a man to where he can live in peace and what was he doing he's explained the split the attributes of his father the attributes of his father had been given unto him as an inheritance and now he's beginning to enjoy his new inheritance amen these are the attributes of his new inheritance and now he's going to explain its Christ and Abraham a man Christ was in Abraham revealing himself by going after his lost brother amen so when when Abraham leaves the Promised Land goes after and saves his brother lot and brings him back remember how many King was down with him it was a you know five or ten kings or whatever it was went down with him and they fought the battle and when they came back the king of Sodom was there and all the other kings around about were there and when they came back there was they won the battle they had won the war and there were certain spoils there was rewards that they're ready to be given out amen and and the king of Sodom offered some of this unto Abraham and Abraham says I don't want I don't want anything that you got amen I don't want anything to do with Sodom I don't want any Asad and stuff amen and as soon as Abraham rejected the things of Sodom God no kids that came and met him on the scene amen and we after after the battle was over after he'd forsaken all after Sodom came back tried to offer her a reward he rejected the reward all suddenly he received a visitation of milk as a deck God was visiting amen now remember we're children of Abraham amen we're children of Abraham now remember he is the same yesterday today and forever and if our father Abraham received a visitation then we're doing a visitation it's our inheritance don't you see that is our inheritance we are doing it belongs to us as part of our inheritance it came with the package so we can't just sit there and and say boy I wish I could be like brother so-and-so I wish I could be like sister so-and-so no you have your own inheritance it's due unto you you are to commune with your father it belongs to you as an inheritance remember after the battle was over what did he do Abraham Abraham had to forsake all a man this is a reward of forsaking all as you receive a visitation mirror these patterns don't change hey man what'd he do he had received a call to leave his father's house and he left all he came into the Promised Land and the world offered him more he rejected everything of Sodom amen and so what did he do he received a visitation of Melchizedek and Milt is like that came and bless him and gave him Communion and there's something about that when you receive a revelation like that it caused him to talk it caused him to give his tidy amen I think about when he met when he received the visitation of milk Ezek he says the bible says he gave unto milk azdak a tenth of all and we are booked his next amen oh we're receiving a visitation you're receiving a visitation right now amen God said that he would speak his word to you he said I'll give unto you pastors teachers evangelists prophets apostles a meant a ministry for the perfecting of the saints so that you can come unto the unity of one body amen and that body will tithe on the dough why will she tile into job because she's received the visitation man amen what where did the Bride of Christ receive she received a calling out from the world she was called to be out separated from the world separated from all things separate from all the sins and foolishness of this world separated from the front from the foolishness of Sodom separated from Babylon we are calling out of that and what do we do we answer the call here we are and we've had a battle we've had a fight without a battle and what do we do we rejected the things of this world and we received Jesus Christ amen now now that we've received Jesus Christ what does he do he visits us he gives us a visitation he preaches his word to us amen as he preaches his word to us through the fivefold ministry then amen and what do we do he's visiting us every Sunday and every Wednesday Torre do we bring our tithes in a place the visitation amen hey man let's turn over to Genesis 14 guess is 14 verse 17 that says and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the vet at the ballet of Shiva which is the Kings Dale and milk his act the king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God well as milk Ezek doing he's coming to his victors amen they fought the battle and he's coming to the victor Amen the one that won the victory over the world they meant and and his lament has neck says he blessed him and he said blessed be Abraham Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth I wonder if Abraham knew he was possessor of heaven that is quite an inheritance I think about who is milk his neck this Jesus Christ it's God Almighty in the flesh and he is now declaring unto his son his child you are the possessor of heaven and earth I don't know if Abraham knew this at that before this moment I don't know if this may have been the first time now he knew the guy gave him the land amen he knew that God had given him a place but now all of a sudden blessed be Abram now I remember just a few more verses from here God's gonna take him out he's God's gonna visit him another time is he coming to the tent where he's dwelling he's gonna grab him by the hand and lead him outside the tent door and he says Abraham I want to show you something and he says I want you to look at the Stars and if you can count them you can count how great your children will be I think about that that's just a few verses from here so eight so milk his neck meets him there after the battle is over and he says unto Abram the Most High God blessed be Abram of the Most High God he's not Abram of Terah amen he's not Abram of Adam and Eve but he's Abram of came out of come out from Abram the son of the Most High God amen a Nissi is the heir the possessor of heaven and earth Abraham has become a child of God a son of God an heir of God there's something about that revelation if you could ever get that revelation of who you are amen of who you are that you are not just a child of your parents but you are a son or a daughter of the Most High God and you're the possessor of heaven and earth that is given unto the children of Abraham we have become the possessors of heaven and of Earth amen we are living here in this natural world in the world but not of the world amen amen and we have been given certain abilities a certain inheritance that we are not just natural children but our inheritance is of the supernatural amen which wish which conquers all natural things amen we've been given a supernatural inheritance because we have become we have been given the power to become the sons and daughters of God and when Abraham received that revelation it costs him to get his timing they drove him to give tithing and the Bible says that and Abraham gave him the revelation was so great why now why did he give a tenth of all we're gonna get down to that in a little bit here there's something about that revelation that caused him to give a tenth of all let's go over to let's turn to mark 10 mark 10 the seventeenth verse and it says and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life you know as many that do this same thing they come running to the Lord Jesus Christ they all kneel at an altar before him and ask for eternal life amen but you know this man did not get what he was looking for this man never received what he was looking for now let's find out why did he not receive what he was looking for good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus send him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and thy mother and he answered and said don't master all of these things I have observed for my youth and jesus beholding him loved him what's Jesus doing he's looking down into his spirit looking down into a soul seeing what is lacking he loves him he find he's finding out where the trouble is right talking with him a little bit they find out where the trouble is amen and here he finds out what the trouble is and he speaks right to that trouble he says one thing thou lackest what is he lacking he's lacking something they're given the ability to enter into eternal life one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me he would become a possessor of heaven and earth he said you will have treasure in heaven right he's given him the opportunity to have treasure in heaven and in the earth amen take up the cross and follow me by forsaking all he will be following after he's run out in this flesh he was a son of Abraham but when he was called to do the same thing Abraham did he said oh oh I can't do what my father Abraham did I can't forsake all I can't do it no no you want me to force a call now his father Abraham forsook all and he was declaring that when he was circumcised he was declaring that he was the son of Abraham but now it comes down to the boiling point are you really a son of Abraham or not a son of Abraham no I'm not a son of Abraham no not a son of Abraham one thing thou lackest go thy way and sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me verse 22 and he was sad at that sing and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God and as disciples were astonished his words but jesus answered again and said unto them children how hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God now think about it it wasn't necessary that he had riches it was that he was trusting and his riches amen Abraham didn't trust in his riches he forsook all God gave him his riches amen it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God why because they will trust in their riches amen let's go down to verse 28 then Peter began to say unto Him lo we have left all and followed thee and jesus answered and said verily I say to you there is no man hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel's but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this fashion he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses brethren sisters mothers children lands with persecutions and the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first amen he would not become a son of Abraham now Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes snot you know there was another man by the name of Zacchaeus who is also a rich man God did not call him to give up everything no but when Zach he when Jesus said to Zacchaeus come down out of that tree for I must sup with you that night and when Zacchaeus was sitting at the supper and the joy of the Lord became his strength he said lo Lord 1/2 that I have I give unto the poor and if I have defrauded anyone I'll give restore to them for full and God did not tell them no no no hat's not good enough you you have to give it all now now the rich young ruler had to give all but Zacchaeus only had to give hat what was it it was not the amount that they gave but as a fact that they are testifying unto the Lord Jesus Christ I am not trusting in my riches I am trusting in Jehovah I am trusting in the one I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah Amen now now let's go back to Genesis 12 Genesis 14 [Music] amen now where maquette or Melchizedek is meeting him after the battle Genesis 14 and then eighteenth verse it says and milk isn't it king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God that's what he was this is milk his next British physician he was the priest of the Most High God amen and he said he blessed and it said blessed be Abram the mode of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth amen and he blessed the Most High God which had delivered thine enemies into a hand and he gave him tithes of all amen Abraham gave tithe on the milk is heaven amen and the king of Sodom sent Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself these are the goods that originally belonged to these other kings Sodom and all the other kings and now they're being offered unto Abraham that you can have these as your own and Abraham said in verse 22 and Abraham said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah unto the Lord the Most High God and the possessor of heaven and earth and that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet from you and and that I will not take anything that is done lest you should say that I have made abram rich amen and then at verse 51 and after these things the word of the Lord came and Abraham in a vision fear not Abraham I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward after he had he forsook everything he has offered the riches of the world he rejected them he said and he declared unto the world I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah unto him I tie they give a tenth of all and he is mine he has made me the possessor of heaven if a man that is our testimony yes we testify that unto saw him amen amen they after that and the neighbor had said Lord what will thou do the scene I am childless amen and you have given me a no seed and then what inverse son we're not get over that part but it's later on we're where God leads him out of ten says look I want you to look up you see the stars of heaven that is your inheritance amen amen he forsook all he forsook Saudi you know the rich young ruler was given an opportunity to declare that he was a son of Abraham he wouldn't do it amen even so we are given our opportunity to declare that we are the sons and daughters of Abraham when were we saved well he wrote our book upon the Lamb's Book of Life what do we do we receive a call come out of her my people the ER not partakers of her sins and we reject mr. Babylon we reject all the riches of mr. Babylon amen you don't have to necessarily sell our you have but you cannot put your trust in your riches amen and when you reject tithes and offerings you are trusting in your riches more than you are trusting in Jehovah your God Wayne us when a person who declares when someone declares that they are the son of Abraham the son of the Most High God but refuses to do the things that Abraham did you're bearing false witness of your own testimony they meant if you do not bring tithes and offerings like your father Abraham did then you were bearing false witness of your own testimony amen now let's let's go that was the revelation of Abraham that's supposed to be our revelation let's go over to our numbers chapter 18 how do we pay our tithe amen where is Melchizedek [Music] where is Melchizedek hey how do we pay tithes to numbers chapter 18 verse 20 this is speaking to Aaron and also do about the Levites remember they were the priests when the when the children of Israel left Egypt and they came coming back to the promised land God gave a Porsche took a tithing of the people and gave them reserve them unto himself God always wants a portion reserved unto himself a mint so he took a portion of the people and reserve the sons of Aaron and the sons of and the sons of Levi and gave them unto himself they were his verse 20 and the Lord spake unto Aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land no inheritance now Abraham was a son of Abraham he was to be possessor of heaven and earth but now the Lord is speaking unto Aaron and saying you will have no inheritance in the very place where I said you would have an inheritance that's a sacrifice that is a sacrifice you know Aaron Aaron giving up isn't by it being a child of Abraham he was to be possessor of heaven and earth and wants to have the inheritance of that land and Aaron forsook that inheritance to serve Jehovah that's given right here he forsook that inheritance he had a right to that land amen they meant Aaron had her right to the promised land he had a right to have crops raised a family he had a right to that he gave that up to be obedient to the oval Amen let's read that again and the Lord spake unto Aaron thou shall have no inheritance in their land neither shall you have any part among them and he says I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children visitor that's an okay trade-off amen that's quite a trade-off I can I can I can do that I can give up the land yup as long as you're with me Lord well as long as you're with me Lord that's okay as long as as long as you're with me just don't leave me Lord that's okay amen and behold verse 21 and behold I have given the churn of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even in the service of the tabernacle of the congregation so they do have an inheritance their inheritance is the title Aaron and his sons and the Levites their inheritance is the tithing name and it belongs to them who gave it to him it wasn't you that's right it was God gave God took away their inheritance out of the land their portion of the physical land and their took it out away he called them to serve Him and because of that sacrifice he gave unto them the tenth of his children the children Israel and if you are his children then your tithing belongs to the ministry and if you reject that then you are it's doing the same thing that rich young ruler did and you're trusting in your riches instead of trusting in the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth you see where we stand yes that's where we stand and then that is that is how important tithing is you know brother Bram said that there that every proper service they must have an offering in order for it to be a complete church service the offering has to be taken up a mint that's why we take up the offer that's why we bring our tithing in why the brother brand said that is not a full and complete service church service unless the offering is taken up that's why we sebastien a meant to be to give honor unto our Lord to be obedient to his call what to give our tithing unto the ministry where we where the God meets us where his word comes forth that now who's speaking right now I did not come up with this message by myself in order for me to come up with this message I you know what had to happen I had to quiet myself before the Lord so why because I cuz I have a fear that I might come up here and speak my own thoughts and that's a great fear that every true minister has there is always this fear that somehow someway you might speak your own thoughts and not his thoughts and that is what we have to be careful about always making sure Lord is this from you or I just want to say what you I don't write anything down in my notes less I feel led to I learned that lesson when I first start preaching that if I if I write down some nifty thing that I read somewhere hurts somewhere like that could be neat that very thing will stumble me when I get up here I have to only write down things in my notes that he gives me amen amen so what is it as part of the ministry that's so so you then you're not here to listen to me because I'm not worth listening to you're here to listen to him amen so when you give tithing you're not giving your tithing necessary to meet you give it to him but that inheritance is to the pulpit is to the work is to the ministry amen amen now let's keep going we read let's read again for verse 21 and behold I've given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their service which they served even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation neither must the Chum of Israel henceforth come nigh to the tabernacle the congregation lest they bear sin and die amen but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their we shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and among the children of Israel that they have no inheritance but the tithes of the children of Israel which they offer as a heave offering unto the Lord I have given to the Levites to inherit therefore I have said unto them among the turn of Israel they shall have no inheritance so when you bring your ties and your offerings into the house of the Lord you were bringing a heave offering unto the Lord amen and you give it unto Jesus Christ the one that called you the one that saved you the one that made you a possessor of heaven earth and what do you do you are forsaking all your testifying I am a son of Abraham I am not trusting in my riches but I have not trouble it I'm not trusting in the riches of Sodom but I have lifted my hand under Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and I am giving my off reading in my ties under lore as the heave offering and God reciprocates and gives that back to the ministry as their inheritance for their sacrifice in their service where they gave up you know brother Isaiah went to college brother Isaiah was in the Air Force he had an opportunity you know in the hotel business I had an opportunity in the Air Force yet he forsook all amen amen he forsook all for the ministry amen and we we have seen the fruits of his ministry his ministry has come with fruits a man it's not he has a in his ministry has been properly vindicated amen that he is part of the fivefold ministry amen and so when we come into this house we are expecting to draw from that ministry that's why we come here why because God has called us a man he said that to assemble yourselves the more as you see the Day approaching amen and so we do we assemble into this room expecting to hear the voice of God through a vessel that has been called has been set apart he has been shown a part of the fivefold ministry amen and he has given up his his rights in this land he has given up the American dream as we say he has given that up the the chance to develop his career amen and he has given all rejected all that Andres tend to to live according to the Ministry of the gospel and God has reciprocated that minute that that sacrifice by giving him an inheritance not just a supernatural inheritance but a natural inheritance God has given unto brother Isaiah you were tight God gave it to him now what happens if you hold back your tithing you are a robber because God gave that to the ministry here as a gift and we hold back your tithing you are not robbing man you are robbing God and you're not tenta you're testifying that you're not a son or daughter of Abraham which is the only way that we can be safe my this is a serious thing amen this is a serious thing you must this is part of the church service this is part of the service you must bring your tithes and offerings under the Lord head amen amen now let's turn over to Ephesians chapter 4 [Applause] Pease in chapter 4 verse 8 right and it says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high that's Jesus when Jesus ascended when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive wasn't that nice of them amen aren't you glad he did that he led captivity captive we don't have to be bound why we became become the possessor of heaven earth by the actions of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he has laid the paths that we might become possessors of heaven earth he led captivity captive we don't have to be captive say Amen we've been set free we're not bound amen so as he ascended he led captivity captive he took it away from us amen amen the Bible says he rebuked the devourer for our sakes amen as Satan came to kill steal and destroy seeking whom he may devour so he led captivity captive but also as he was ascending what did he do he came he gave back gifts unto men that was on the day of Pentecost that's when it started how did he do it he sent the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost do it anointed the men that he landed upon some men were anointed to be husband's some men were be anointed to be housewives some some were anointed to be farmers but some of those gifts landed upon certain monk men amongst you brethren part of the body of Christ and those gifts have titles amen and these are what those titles are and he gave verse 11 and he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers why'd he give these gifts for you for you because you are declaring that you are the sons and daughters of Abraham he wants you to become perfect in that Amen why so that we're not halfway declaring so we're not making a partial declaration now let me tell you I have come a long ways since brother Isaiah became my pastor the fruits of his ministry evident at least in this life amen why by his sacrifice so he is given amen the sacrifice that he gave to to give his life for the ministry God has blessed a sacrifice has anointed him to be a pastor and bi and I have followed that ministry I have tied them to that ministry and God has brought forth the fruits in my own life I've been changed since 2007 in January now in almost 12 years now I have been I'm a changed man I am being perfected by the ministry that God gave unto me a meant it for the purse twelve for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith we got a beat we are having in the unity of the faith we are belief we all know who we are amen when we know who we are will become a powerhouse amen amen till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that is your inheritance you have an inheritance that's what it is it has been given unto you amen that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of Man by cutting craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking out now that comes to every one of us amen but we've been given a power that is to make us overcomers of all that amen but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ all things possessors of heaven and earth amen peace belongs to us joy is our inheritance love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness hey it's art yes it belongs to us it is our inheritance amen amen and God has given us a ministry so that we can come into that perfection amen and we and he is also given that ministries of tithing he gave God took out of our bank account and gave it to brother Isaiah before the foundation of the world amen we bear testimony of what God did we write our tithe check and we Rob God when we don't amen amen now let's turn over to Malachi chapter 3 I got about a few more scriptures here to go through we want to be obedient you know there's fear there's blessings and obedience that cannot be measured blessings and obedience I cannot be measured amen Malachi chapter 3 verse 8 it says will a man Rob God are you thankful how could that be how can a man Rob God how is it possible yet ye have robbed me no they didn't rob the Levites they didn't rob the house the sons of Aaron they robbed God how did they rob God they stole something from God why because God was transferring a gift from himself unto the Levites through you and you grabbed a hold of it trusting in your riches declaring that you're not a son or daughter of Abraham and held it back Robbie go but ye say wherein have we robbed thee and G and God says in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation so because they robbed God they were cursed with the curt's Wow this is serious this is really serious this is no joke we gotta be sons and daughters of Abraham yeah why we've been called we know we don't want to go back out there we know we want to be here but how do we stay here you know we do be into the one that saved us bring me all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith says Lord if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing and there shall not be room enough to receive it and furthermore and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your vine casts our fruit before the time in the field saith the Lord of hosts and all nations shall call you a blessing call you blessed for you should be a delight some land saith the Lord amen I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes amen now what is Satan do he comes to kill steal and destroy he has come to what he is he has gone forth Satan himself as God forth as a lion as a lion seeking whom he may devour amen he has come by your house he was in your house too sweet the lion was coming by your house this week what was he doing he is looking at who he could devour a man but God said I will rebuke the Devourer for your so the he wanna touch your house why would it if you will pay your tithes under the ministry now I thought peut rise is just a natural thing we did or just a tradition or something like that I thought was optional a lot of people think it's optional amen would you like to devour to be rebuked a man wouldn't you like that wouldn't you like to not have to fight the lion by yourself Luther wants to fight a lion with your bare hands oh you're now the Lions coming amen he's coming to your house the lion is coming to your door but he can be rebuked right here says so I will and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he will not destroy the fruits of your ground you're gonna be blessed amen now I mean that in a Pentecostal domination away amen let's turn over to Deuteronomy chapter 12 I would encourage all of you to read this entire chapter we won't do it today amen because he was the same yesterday today and forever [Music] Deuteronomy chapter 12 these are the statutes and judgments which he shall observe to do and all the land in the land which the Lord God of thy father's giveth thee to possess it all the days that you shall live upon the earth they many may hear living upon the earth amen you shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nation's that ye shall possess serve their gods amen and upon all the high mountains upon the hills and under every Green Tree ye shall overthrow the alters he shall break their pillars burn down their groves with fire he shall hew down the graven images of their gods and he shall destroy the names of them out of that place amen we've all been called to do that in our own land when you are called to serve Jehovah you have to forsake all and burn down all the things you used to worship cue down the trees were used to worship and forsake all this if you used to worship your riches or sports or where all is you've got a shoe all that down forsake all to serve them and all the names of them out of your life amen and you shall not serve God like that amen verse 7 verse 4 you shall not do so under the Lord your God but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose have all of your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall you see and thither shalt thou come and thither he shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and your heave offering of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks and there now watch verse 6 that says and thither verse 7 says and there that means you're going somewhere where are you going you're going toward the ministry is your traveling watch that verse six and thither ye shall bring verse seven and there you shall eat before the Lord your God he shall rejoice and all that you put your hand done to you and your household wearing the LORD thy God hath blessed thee you're coming somewhere what are you doing you're leaving your house people say oh I can stay home on the internet and I can just mail my check off I think of my tithe check off over here no no no you have to leave your house then come unto the place where God has placed his name in the ministry where the Word of God comes forth what was God has his ministers we read there in Ephesians that he's when he was ascending up on high as he was ascending he threw down some gifts unto men amen it started on the day of Pentecost and it's still going into this day that made her being anointed hey man what do you do you find that place in your local area where God has given that unto you as to a gift I believe that every true child of God that God has given that gift to Amen you ought to have a pastor why because if God has given you a gift then you should have it if you don't have a pastor then why are you why don't you have something that God gave to you if God gave you a pat he said right there in the Bible he gave unto you a gift of a pastor and if you say oh I don't have a pastor why don't you have a pastor God gave them to you why don't you have it the pattern is and thither you'll leave and there you will go but if you will not go then you have a gift somewhere that you're missing you're missing something God gave it to you but you're missing it you're missing out amen God gave you a ministry amen and there you shall eat before the Lord your God verse 7 now first let's go to verse 10 verse 10 after the battles over after all the wandering the wilderness comes to verse 10 but when he go over Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord God your God giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all of your enemies round about so you shall dwell in safety what are you doing you're coming into the house of the Lord you're being projected from the devour you've come into this church under the protection of Jehovah God protects the body of the Lord Jesus Christ then there shall be a place there will be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithe and heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye shall bow unto the Lord and ye shall rejoice before the Lord where do you rejoice before the Lord people say oh no that's a sense all of a supernatural thing but when you come into this house you're testifying this is where you can't Amen why because there's a connection here this this sanctuary really does mean something we say oh it's just a natural building doesn't mean anything and I don't have to that's just an excuse so you have to pay your time so you hear your test find you know the son or daughter of Abraham amen thither shall ye bring all that I command you now verse 12 and he shall rejoice before the Lord your God ye and your sons and your daughters and all your men servants and your maidservants and a Levite those within your gates for as much as he hath no part or no inheritance with you you're going to go and rejoice with the Levite that God gave you God gave you a Levite you got to go leave your house and rejoice with them that sounds like church to me Amen and when you go and rejoice with them you have to bring your tithes and your offerings and your rejoicing sounds like Church to me that's Church amen amen now verse 13 take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest so there's a special place it's not just anywhere it's not just on the Gulf over here pay tithes over here this week I'm gonna go off over there and pay ties this week no God gave you a pass amen God gave you a pastor you know I think I'm gonna pay half of my tithes over to Jeffersonville or I'm gonna pay half of my ties over to Johnson City and I'm gonna bring the other half here to Des Moines what are you what is the word tithe mean it means a tenth if you bring nine percent of your of your increase is that tithing that's not tithing will God reward it no your as disobedience nine percent is not a tenth nine percent is not ten percent gross your increase your tiny ten percent where do you bring it verse 13 take heed watch out be careful take heed to thyself that thou offer not my burnt offering in every place that they'll see us but in the place that the Lord shall choose in one of my tribes which is the ministry that's the ministry he who God sent down the gift upon bring find out who is your pastor and pay tithes unto him 10 percent there so you offer thy burnt offerings and there thou shalt do all that I command thee amen now let's go to verse 17 now may is not God pursue that some people will try and do this thou mayst not eat within thy gates that's your house the tide of thy corn or of thy wine or the oil of thy firstlings or of thy hurts or of thy flock or of a thy vows that was nor of thy free will offerings or the heave offering of thy hand so if you have the 10% of your income that God has already promised to give unto your pastor and you hold it back and Rob God and then you use that money to go out and buy something at McDonald's and bring it back to your house and eat it there you're in disobedience to this verse if you use that because God already that tithing never doesn't belong to you it belongs to God into his ministry and if you hold it back and Rob God and then use it for something else in your household in your gates then this verse is against you amen thou mayst not verse 17 thou mayst not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or the oil or the first things that I herds or LifeLock or every near the bowels of the house nor the free will offerings or the heave offering of thine hand but thou must verse 18 but thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place that the LORD thy God shall choose now and thy son and thy daughter and I'm answer it and I made servant and the Levite those within thy gates now this is just completely natural talking here brother Isaiah where does his food come from it just think him as his natural food he goes to high V goes to Walmart buy some food where did that food come from the Lord God gave him a 10% of the bride of Lord Jesus Christ of all the blessings that she has received upon this earth all the natural blessings all of her increased everything that is given to her by somebody else and when she receives it she marks off the 10% and that that 10% is something that God has reserved unto her ministry amen and he eats of that partakes of that and his body has been completely created by the DNA that he has purchased as has been sustained by the food that he has purchased with your tithing amen when he comes into this he is not weak he is not tired he is not hungry he is not worn down why because he has had enough to sustain himself to have a shelter over his head amen to have a shelter over his head to have food that he can go eat and provide for his children why because that is his inheritance and if you hold that back from you've robbed God so you must come and eat with eat the word in this house and the word comes out brother Isaiah's mouth due to the strength that he has received by the food that he is eating out of your hand verse 19 take heed to thyself watch out be careful take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as they liveth upon the earth be careful watch out be very very careful that you don't miss out make sure that you're giving your tithe in unto the Levite that is closest to your house Amen God when he ascended up on high gave gifts unto many and he is foreseeing that that gift was right here in your neighborhood a place a mouthpiece where the Word of God can leave his mouth where he can be inspired by the holy spirit and living God and preached unto you and verse 19 Deuteronomy 12 verse 19 be very very careful take heed to thyself that you forsake not the Levite as long as now limits upon yours all the days of your life be careful make sure that you're paying your tithes under the ministry not out of your house not somewhere on the internet not some town far off but 10% of whatever man gives unto you of whatever God blesses with you you mark that 10% and you bring it unto the gift that God has given you which in this sound brother Isaiah Brooks that's the gospel amen tithes and offerings that's the gospel and God will see to it watch out let's go back now okay Malachi 3 verse 10 bring me all the tithes not some of them bring the 10% into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house spiritual food in due season right here God you know brother Isaiah listens to the message every day it was like he's told me he says I listen to a message every single day and the Holy Spirit that he reads his Bible he prays he listens to the tapes the Holy Spirit gathers out of that since is what is the need of this local congregation and gives it out through his mouth and we are perfected by that a men I know I have I hope you have a men bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith Lord of Hosts if I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall be not room enough to receive it and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes guess the Saint is going like a roaring lion seeking you made about amen that's first Peter 5:8 amen amen we've become heirs of God and the 10% of all that man gives belongs under the ministry that God has given us amen that true we believe that Saints amen amen we have lifted our hand unto Jehovah the Most High God we have rejected all the things of Sodom and Gomorrah and they have not made us rich everything we have has come to us from God what do you have that you did not first receive if you did receive it why would you be prideful of seeking that my own education or my own resources or my own intelligence has given me this good job this good career or this whatever no you receive that because God gave that to you and when God gave that to you 10% of that was just a pass on through onto the MIT local ministry in your neighborhood amen now in this church we have the tithing basket is right here this is the tithing basket amen and the 10% goes into the tithing basket that and that only you know what that is for that is for the ministry but it's not for this building amen it is for the ministry this is God himself said he said bring in the tithing so that there might be meat in my house amen you say oh I wish I wish there was deepness I wish that the mess is one more deep have you paid your tithing amen you pay your tithing God will bring you the desires of your heart the deep that you're looking for amen that is the mystery amen I know that evangelist and everything comes out of that is the ministry it's for the ministry amen and the offerings we pass the basket right there for the offerings the offering pays for the lights and it pays for this building the rent for the insurance policies that we have and just all the natural things to do with running this church and it goes that goes to the trustee the trustee writes out the checks and distributes it as the church has neat so we gotta have a nice place that we could come into this place and rejoice with our Levi brother Isaiah who has been chosen by God to be a pastor over this local hospital why so we might be perfected and coming to the unity of the body of Christ because if we didn't have this place really how could people say oh it's all supernatural I can stay at home I can do this I can do that how in the world are you going to be do you not believe when the Bible says iron sharpens iron and it only does that when it contacts a man only sharpens iron when it makes contact iron sharpens iron and it begins right here amen you have a ministry to the Bride of Christ yourself by bringing your lick of fire into this place amen to rejoice before the Lord the Bible linked tithing and rejoicing together amen so wherever it is you come to rejoice with the gift that God gave you you owe your tithing to where you get the word and you bro you're offering there the tithing is 10% of all the man gives you a mint all the gods bless with you with a mint and and also the honor above that and offering a free will he bought offering them to the Lord amen and a rejoicing amen we owe to God why because we've lifted up our hand like our father Abraham he called me he chose me he drew me out for the things of the world he separated me from all the foolishness of Laodicea and he set me here in a seat he gave me a ministry he gave me a job he gave me an increase I have marked that tenth I had given unto the ministry and the Ministry has thrived here amen and I have been perfected by it my garment is lost by what is white about spot without wrinkle because it has been intruded into me as righteousness because I believe the Lord and all in the fullness of what was word I believed him that's been attributed unto me a for righteousness and now I'm a possessor of the heavens and the earth one inheritance and I got like I heard about this inheritance because of the ministry and it wasn't a weak ministry as a powerful ministry and the ministry didn't have to worry about about about you know all the natural things why because the inheritance that they received of their own they didn't they rejected their natural careers to give their entire time over to the ministry I benefit from it and I get my tithe and offering so they might have free reign we have a local church or my children can be raised in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord amen and the same goes unto you that's why we bring our tithes the 10% and that's why we bring our offering if we don't do that then how can we say that we are sons and daughters of Abraham how can we say that we are possessors of heaven and earth how can we say that we are the bride of Lord Jesus Christ if we won't do the things that he told us to do it Amen let's just an obedience brings faith and faith we'll give you all things Amen let's just bow our heads in word prayer Heavenly Father I just want to thank you Lord for this divine appointment or for leading us through this word a Laura it's your word Lord and I believe it or I've been reading this Bible now for 25 years Lord and it has never failed me yet or and I thank you for it Lord or forgiving me this gospel but more than that lord I can't just sit at home and read this gospel Lord I have to

I pray over the inheritance that you have given in this Des Moines Lord I don't know where all that inheritance is you gave them an inheritance of the tightenin of this town some may have withheld it Lord some may have right now be robbing God by staying home and keeping their inheritance back brother Isaiah's and haircuts I don't know where it all is Saints the Lord right now in your name where I call it father I pray Lord that you go into all those houses where they're eating your inheritance Lord in their house where there instead of bringing the ties to the storehouse of God they're eating their ties at home well I pray you to convict them right now forgive them Lord they don't know what they're doing Lord they're rejecting you Lord as you ascended up on high or the rejecting the gift that you sent amongst us Lord by eating their tithes at home and robbing God lord I pray to you convict them in the name of Lord Jesus Christ wherever they may be but the storehouse may be full and bring him into this place Lord that they can rejoice with us so they can be perfected with us at the Bride of Christ would not be a weak body in this town but be a strong body full of grace and truth that we could be the ministers of righteousness everywhere we go and though we could be strengthened by the ministry that you gave us in this town I thank you for brother Isaiah Lord I pray you bless him and keep him good Lord they you'd that you would find that his inheritance would not be withheld from Lord lord I thank you for mark where you bless him and his family or and I just thank you for
