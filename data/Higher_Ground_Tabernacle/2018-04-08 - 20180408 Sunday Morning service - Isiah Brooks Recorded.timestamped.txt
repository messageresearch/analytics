[5:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[5:47] amen god bless you can be see it a man
[5:51] that a poor soundboard back there the
[5:53] knobs are loose and they come off and
[5:56] you go and put in one position and you
[5:58] ends up being in a different position
[5:59] and it's not easy soundboard to run and
[6:04] then like driving an old model T when
[6:06] you're used to driving up a Ford
[6:08] Hey Amen let's uh let's um like I said
[6:15] service this morning
[6:17] title the message expectation Amen we've
[6:21] we've all got expectations in life a man
[6:25] we all have things have been promised us
[6:26] we have things that we think life will
[6:30] go this way if we do this and we just
[6:32] come to have an expectation about things
[6:35] you know if you have a job you you you
[6:38] have an expectation you have a paycheck
[6:40] every week you know we've just come to
[6:41] the trust and those paychecks amen if we
[6:45] ever got a job where they say well we'll
[6:47] pay you this month and we might not pay
[6:49] it for another six months and then you
[6:51] just never know what to expect that'd be
[6:53] a a hard way to be when a person's used
[6:56] to paying their monthly bills on time
[6:58] because you have use use of an expect or
[7:01] expectation of a paycheck every month
[7:03] you know it's just something we we some
[7:06] people become so reliant on that
[7:08] paycheck you know you always skits are
[7:11] wondering boy what would happen if these
[7:12] paychecks quit coming in you know what
[7:15] would happen if all sudden you know you
[7:17] went a month or two or three or four
[7:19] without a paycheck what would happen you
[7:21] know and you as the bills to start
[7:23] coming in you know you but you know we
[7:25] have an expectation of these paychecks
[7:27] you know and that's just an unnatural
[7:30] thing you know but in a supernatural way
[7:33] God has said I will take care of you a
[7:36] man I will meet you all your needs
[7:39] amen as the Lord is taking care of the
[7:42] sparrow and you know the sparrow doesn't
[7:45] have to worry about this worry about
[7:46] that but
[7:47] says I have fed the sparrow a menu as
[7:50] the the flowers of the field they do not
[7:53] worry about what kind of clothing
[7:55] they're gonna put on by God himself has
[7:57] given them they were clothing God has
[7:59] given us pair with our food and so God
[8:01] also watches over us amen and so even
[8:05] more than our earthly paychecks we have
[8:08] grown into expectation that God will
[8:10] take care of a man we might lose our job
[8:13] tomorrow we might lose our job next week
[8:16] you know we might get to a place where
[8:18] we can never work again but one thing we
[8:19] do know for sure is we know that God we
[8:22] have an expectation that God will take
[8:24] care of us amen God will watch over us
[8:27] amen he is the God that he he says there
[8:30] in Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul
[8:33] and all that is within me bless His Holy
[8:36] Name Amen bless the Lord O my soul and
[8:39] forget not all of his benefits amen we
[8:42] owe we ought to be in a place where
[8:43] remember what our God has done for us
[8:46] hey man remember what he's capable of I
[8:48] mean he can't be in a proper expectation
[8:51] of somebody until you know what they're
[8:52] capable of doing Amen you know we look
[8:54] at our companies we work for we know
[8:57] we're know they're capable of paying us
[8:59] every week so that's why we have great
[9:00] faith in them but even more so with God
[9:02] we know that our God is able to able to
[9:05] you know if we get in a like when we
[9:08] first became Christians you know I think
[9:12] just about everybody and you're in here
[9:13] if we became Christians we didn't come
[9:16] here become a Christian just because it
[9:18] sounded like a neat thing to do we even
[9:21] become Christians just because we
[9:25] thought maybe we'd get along there in
[9:26] life but we became Christians because at
[9:28] some point in our life God some point in
[9:32] our life we were shaking down to our the
[9:34] very core of our be Amen there there
[9:36] came a point in our life to where we
[9:38] could no longer do things for ourselves
[9:40] like you can normally expect a man alone
[9:43] everybody has a if you've become a
[9:45] Christian at some point in your life you
[9:47] became there because at some point in
[9:49] your life you were shaking in your mind
[9:51] Amen you're shaking in your thoughts you
[9:54] were your shaking down to the very core
[9:56] of your being there was there's
[9:58] something in your life that caused you
[9:59] to realize that
[10:01] you need something greater than yourself
[10:03] amen you need it you needed help from
[10:06] someone greater than you could help
[10:08] yourself you know is the longer you go
[10:11] in life the more disappointments in life
[10:13] that you have the more you begin to
[10:15] realize do you need something greater
[10:17] than yourself
[10:18] amen you know when you're when you're
[10:20] young and you maybe know I had too many
[10:22] experiences in life you know you first
[10:26] begin to learn to trust Lord as you you
[10:28] know as a teenager you know you have all
[10:30] the emotions of life and all the
[10:32] disappointments all the depressions and
[10:34] different things and and you know you
[10:36] learn to trust the Lord in that and sure
[10:38] enough the Lord brings you through the
[10:40] own you gained here or the early early
[10:43] 20s you know you have an expectation you
[10:45] you want to start a family you want to
[10:47] get married and have a husband or a wife
[10:50] and then that brings a whole new set of
[10:52] challenges in life amen you begin to
[10:55] learn to trust Lord with that once you
[10:57] begin to have that expectation you see
[10:58] you see God bring you through this stage
[11:01] of life and then he brings you through
[11:03] the next stage of life then is your
[11:05] children get older you know and you be
[11:07] in you know if they your child's first
[11:09] sickness you know the first time they
[11:11] have a cough or they're struggling to
[11:13] breathe and you start worrying or they
[11:15] have a some rash that covers their
[11:17] entire body or something you know yeah
[11:18] and you know the the sickness comes
[11:21] already you're like oh Lord what do I do
[11:22] and young God brings them through a man
[11:25] if you've ever seen God come into your
[11:27] house and heal one of your children you
[11:29] know it's like amen what because you
[11:31] begin to have an expectation when God
[11:33] when you see God take care of that thing
[11:36] then they just raise your faith a little
[11:38] bit higher amen going as you get longer
[11:42] and long in life you know as you you're
[11:44] a husband or wife you know and you and
[11:46] you get to the point where maybe you
[11:48] disappoint your spouse or you become
[11:50] disappointed in your other spouse you
[11:51] know one displaying one with the other
[11:54] and you have to come down and kind of
[11:57] reset your marriage all over again you
[11:59] know you just come to a place where
[12:01] you've done something to get the other
[12:03] person or you've allowed yourself to
[12:04] grow cold one toward the other and you
[12:06] kind of have to hit the reset button and
[12:08] get down at the altar and shake yourself
[12:11] all over again and then also you begin
[12:14] to realize that God
[12:15] the coolest the sweetness of his
[12:16] presence comes back and restores the
[12:18] whole situation all over again and
[12:20] brings a restoration then he began to
[12:23] realize what God has capable of these
[12:25] are the benefits of being a Christian a
[12:27] man because he'll never let you get too
[12:29] far
[12:30] a man he never lets you get too far away
[12:33] from him I mean but he brings you back
[12:35] to a place of restoration amen and when
[12:37] you come to that place you begin to
[12:39] realize when you realize oh my the Lord
[12:42] wouldn't let me get too far the Lord
[12:44] wouldn't let me go this way or he
[12:45] wouldn't let me go he'll let you go so
[12:47] far off the path and the east sets is
[12:49] like he's just sets his angel right
[12:51] there and he stops you he says you don't
[12:53] want to go this way my child you don't
[12:55] want to go that way and then God brings
[12:57] you right back to the path he restores
[12:59] you so you can come back all over again
[13:01] say bless the Lord O my soul and forget
[13:04] not all of his benefits bless the Lord O
[13:07] my soul a man why because he is he is is
[13:11] what he forget not all of his benefits
[13:14] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[13:17] healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth
[13:20] thy life from destruction who crowns
[13:22] thee with lovingkindness and tender
[13:26] mercies amen I think back to my own
[13:28] childhood you know it you know what I
[13:31] think I probably told my story to most
[13:34] people you know but you know I went
[13:37] through large pressure when I was
[13:38] growing up you know and and I went
[13:40] through a lot of things and I decide at
[13:42] one point that I was gonna grow up and
[13:44] be a homeless wonder you know and that's
[13:46] that's why I wanted to be in life I want
[13:48] to just go you know ride the trains or
[13:50] do ever it is you live in the woods
[13:52] that's why I decide I wanted to be in
[13:54] life you know but in the midst of all my
[13:56] depression God came down and changed you
[14:00] know when I got so low in my life God
[14:02] came down and revealed himself to me and
[14:05] he won't know why I look at this word I
[14:06] looked at the Bible and cire looking
[14:08] through I was like Lord I see how you've
[14:10] dealt with every Coble character I see
[14:12] how you how you were there for Saint
[14:15] Paul I see how you were there for Elijah
[14:17] I see how you were there for every
[14:19] single one of them for for Jonah Lorna
[14:22] or for Sampson every single one of them
[14:25] when they got to a certain point God you
[14:27] were there for them
[14:28] a man I'd like it to be Lord that I
[14:31] could have the same experience in my own
[14:33] life that I can know that without a
[14:35] doubt that that when I need you you'll
[14:37] be there for me
[14:38] amen and you know what God has met me in
[14:41] that way amen I had a desire that
[14:43] whatever the Bible characters
[14:46] experienced in their life I wanted to
[14:49] have the same experience
[14:50] hey man and God brought me this message
[14:52] to show me that way a man that I could
[14:55] do that the Bible days are not over amen
[14:58] they're not the you know it's not just
[15:00] god of two thousand years ago a man but
[15:03] we're serving a god right now amen and
[15:06] there's still Bible characters living on
[15:08] this earth a man and those Bible
[15:10] characters are you it's me
[15:12] a man and we're no different than the
[15:13] Sampson's and the Jonah's and Elijah's
[15:16] and the Mary's and the Martha's a man
[15:19] why because we're still living in Bible
[15:20] days and God is still here answering
[15:23] prayers and doing things like he decide
[15:25] in the Bible you know a brother Branham
[15:27] when he started his when he started his
[15:30] meetings back in the 1930s and 40s way
[15:34] before the tapes he had an old truck and
[15:37] he painted on the side of that truck
[15:38] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[15:40] and forever amen he started his ministry
[15:43] on that he ended his ministry on that
[15:46] that Christ is the same that no matter
[15:48] what you go through in this life journey
[15:50] you can always be sure - one thing that
[15:52] Christ will be the same amen all of us
[15:56] ought to stand on that rock that Jesus
[15:57] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[16:00] forever amen he will not change amen he
[16:03] is the same Amen that when we have a
[16:05] need of something on life's journey we
[16:07] have an expectation that God will meet
[16:09] us I mean if you get to a place where
[16:12] you throw your you've cool it off
[16:14] towards God you've you've gotten to a
[16:16] place where you don't know what to do
[16:17] here don't know what to do there you can
[16:19] always come right back to Calvary you
[16:21] can always come right back to Calvary
[16:23] right here and sit here for a while and
[16:25] God will have mercy on you and come back
[16:28] and meet you all over again
[16:30] Amen you can never get too far where
[16:32] there isn't a reset button you can push
[16:34] on this and come right back to where
[16:36] Christ is and meet him again all over at
[16:38] the cross
[16:41] amen amen just like Sarah found out when
[16:44] she was 90 years old who read there in
[16:45] Genesis God remembered me amen think
[16:49] about this she was at the end of her
[16:51] journey she's nine years old
[16:53] God has met her and given her the thing
[16:55] that she's looked for all of her life
[16:57] amen now she's seeing God do all kinds
[17:00] of things she had seen God do all kinds
[17:02] of things in her life she had lots of
[17:05] little things they had need but they had
[17:06] one thing that they had been looking for
[17:08] consoling that was a son and they've
[17:10] been waved that thing for 25 years a man
[17:13] while God had answered a lot of their
[17:15] prayers he had give taking care of their
[17:17] needs they lived in a dry desert land
[17:19] yeah God faithfully met all those needs
[17:21] but there was still one thing there's
[17:23] always on the back of their mind is when
[17:25] is God going to meet this promise when
[17:28] is God gonna meet this promise but they
[17:30] waited and they waited in the way and
[17:31] one time and finally after a while after
[17:34] 25 years God came through and met their
[17:37] expectation a man the same thing is with
[17:40] us we all have an expectation you we
[17:42] might see God do so many things in our
[17:44] life so you know we might see God heal
[17:46] this or heal that or do this little
[17:48] thing here a little thing there but we
[17:50] all have an expectation of of walking
[17:53] step by step with God we all have an
[17:55] expectation where we would have a desire
[17:57] that we won't be led by the Holy Spirit
[17:59] of God to be led by the Holy Ghost amen
[18:02] is no matter how much God does for us
[18:05] and this part of our life or over in
[18:07] this part of her life but we always
[18:09] serve we'll never be satisfied until we
[18:11] can say of a surety that we know that
[18:13] God that our footsteps are being ordered
[18:15] of the Lord that we're walking day by
[18:17] day with God that we're walking day by
[18:19] day we know that God is ordering
[18:21] everything one of our steps that we can
[18:23] wake up in the morning and know that we
[18:24] can hear his voice
[18:25] Amen that we can wake up in the morning
[18:27] and say what would you like to do today
[18:29] Lord because we are looking for that
[18:31] walk with God amen and none of us will
[18:33] be satisfied until we could you know as
[18:36] much as as good if it is for God to meet
[18:38] us here in the service as good as it is
[18:40] for God to answer a prayer to give us a
[18:43] new job or to do those things that none
[18:46] of it compares to when God meets us on
[18:48] our day by day walk with Him amen and
[18:51] that's what Calvary is done for us how
[18:53] Christ died that we might have that walk
[18:56] farm
[18:57] amen amen
[19:00] let's turn over to Psalms 143 hey man we
[19:10] come to the house of correction every
[19:11] every day so that or every week all
[19:13] right well why we come to the house of
[19:15] correction why so we can be changed from
[19:17] the what if there be anything in our
[19:19] life that's contrary to what God had for
[19:21] us that we can be changed you know when
[19:25] Christ died on the cross he had in his
[19:29] mind he had something in his mind
[19:32] now remember Christ is a creator he
[19:35] created the heavens and the earth amen
[19:38] and he had something in his mind when he
[19:40] died on Calvary he had something in his
[19:43] mind he had a purpose for which he was
[19:45] dying on Calvary for a man he wasn't
[19:48] just dying there for no reason he had a
[19:50] reason that he died therefore he died
[19:52] there so that you and me that we could
[19:54] have life and have it more abundantly
[19:55] he said amen and that life is not just
[19:58] any old life that's his own life but how
[20:01] we preached last week on the book of
[20:02] life crying Jesus Christ God himself
[20:05] wrote a book called life amen he is the
[20:08] author of it but when you open up that
[20:10] book you know is like like we said last
[20:12] week and you know any man when he writes
[20:14] a book he puts has in mind he has
[20:16] something that he wants to have inside
[20:18] that book he writes a book because he
[20:20] has something in mind amen and he has a
[20:23] he has a story that he wants to express
[20:25] he wants to express the glory of
[20:27] wherever is in his mind he wants to get
[20:29] down on paper so that it can be
[20:31] expressed to the others a man once said
[20:34] getting once someone opens up that book
[20:36] and they look down on the inside then
[20:39] that whatever is on the inside of the
[20:40] book and begin to be expressed to other
[20:42] people
[20:43] amen and so that after reading the book
[20:46] that whoever reads the book can have the
[20:49] same thing in their mind that the author
[20:51] had Amen and yo you know anybody that's
[20:54] a good reader you know yeah it's like me
[20:57] when I read a book I'm not seeing the
[20:58] words on the page I'm watching a movie
[21:00] in my mind you know what because when
[21:02] you get into a book it's no longer just
[21:04] the words on the page but you're you're
[21:06] in ear
[21:07] transported into a world where you're
[21:10] not just seeing the words on the page
[21:11] anymore but you're just watching a movie
[21:13] in your mind you're you're seeing the
[21:15] experience you know you know if you've
[21:17] ever watched watched a movie that was
[21:20] based upon a book you read the book
[21:22] first and then then when you watch the
[21:24] movie like let's know what that
[21:25] character is supposed to look like or
[21:27] that's not the way it's supposed to go
[21:28] because in your mind this is how this is
[21:30] how I saw in my mind you know
[21:33] Amen but God wrote a book called life
[21:37] and if there's anybody they ought to
[21:39] know what life is all about it's God
[21:41] amen he is the author of life he knows
[21:44] what life is all about a man so when God
[21:46] wrote a book called life and when you
[21:48] open up but it doesn't have big flowery
[21:51] language for this long story read
[21:53] through it you open a book and it all
[21:55] has its names in there the only thing in
[21:58] the book of life is names but when the
[22:00] author of life went to write the book of
[22:02] life instead of writing all these big
[22:04] fancy stories he just started writing
[22:06] names these names are gonna describe my
[22:10] life on the earth and he got down he
[22:13] started writing you know Adam and Abel
[22:16] and Moses you know he kept writing
[22:18] Elijah and Samson and Joshua Joseph all
[22:22] these names are describing the life of
[22:25] God on down through history and when you
[22:27] read the testimonies you II you know
[22:29] like when Jesus came and died on the
[22:31] cross you say oh my here you begin to
[22:33] realize that you know Joseph was a type
[22:35] of Christ he began to realize that Jonah
[22:38] was a type of Christ he Owens like well
[22:40] how did they do that how did they type
[22:43] out Christ
[22:43] how did Joseph get sold for thirty
[22:46] pieces of silver how did he how did he
[22:49] do it did he have in his mind that he
[22:51] wanted to act out something that you
[22:52] know God was making that man he was
[22:55] typing out life he was his name Joseph's
[22:59] name was on the book of life how did how
[23:01] did it get soul into the prison and have
[23:03] the butler on the right hand and the
[23:04] baker on the ran by Christ on the cross
[23:06] had the thief on the right and the thief
[23:08] on the left how did he do that his name
[23:11] was on the book of life and he was
[23:12] expressing God's story God's story
[23:15] through his own life amen how did how
[23:18] did Jonah go down into the belly of the
[23:19] whale three days and three
[23:21] how did he own Jonah here he thought he
[23:23] is what he is like imagine Jonah going
[23:26] to bed every night why am I such a
[23:28] disobedient prophet why am I such a
[23:30] disobedient man you know God says to go
[23:32] do this and I go do that God tells me to
[23:35] go down to go down to Nineveh and I go
[23:38] down to Tarshish instead and he be
[23:40] kicking himself you know there on the
[23:42] boat
[23:42] why am I so disobedient why do I keep
[23:44] doing this why do I keep doing that but
[23:46] yet all along God was using his life to
[23:49] write the story of God and again when
[23:52] and when Jonah got thrown overboard with
[23:55] his hands behind tied behind his back
[23:56] that God prepared a special fish compass
[23:59] swallow and he went down to the bottom
[24:02] of the sea for three days and three
[24:03] nights and Jesus self and said the Son
[24:06] of Man will be in the belly of the earth
[24:07] for three days and three nights just
[24:09] like Jonah was in the belly of the fish
[24:11] a managed ona he thought he was in the
[24:15] midst of the word his worst disobedience
[24:18] he thought he completely ruined the plan
[24:21] of God he thought he had completely
[24:23] ruined God's plan for his life he
[24:26] thought he completely destroyed
[24:27] everything that God had called him think
[24:30] about his Jonah as a young man as the
[24:32] presence of Laura come upon him and he a
[24:34] prophesy and he of the presence of Laura
[24:36] come I need prophesy he began to realize
[24:38] that God had chosen him and his ego on
[24:41] be always struggle with this
[24:42] disobedience seeking why is that when
[24:44] God says go do this I would go do that
[24:47] and he will gut yet God called him
[24:50] nonetheless and there he when God says I
[24:52] need you to go around and in avoid he
[24:54] instead he walks and goes and takes the
[24:56] boat to Tarsus he's kicking himself all
[24:58] on why am I doing this why am I doing
[25:00] this
[25:01] being all along God had a purpose all
[25:03] along God in the midst of the most of
[25:06] his missile is most disobedient act God
[25:10] was allowing him to type out the most
[25:12] obedient thing they'll ever be done on
[25:13] the earth that Christ would go to
[25:15] Calvary think about it it right in the
[25:18] myths of Jonah's disobedience he is
[25:20] typing out the most obedient thing ever
[25:22] done on the earth well who wrote this
[25:25] who wrote the script who wrote the
[25:28] script God Almighty
[25:30] a man who wrote the script for your life
[25:33] amen be as we have been written on the
[25:34] same book Amen the same book we're
[25:37] describing the life of Christ amen and
[25:40] we all have you know we all have our had
[25:42] our disappointments in life
[25:44] we've all had things that we wish we
[25:45] hadn't had done and sometimes you know
[25:47] it takes our breath away the the foolish
[25:49] things that we've done on this life you
[25:51] know and when God has constantly called
[25:54] us and called us and called us and and
[25:56] we look at the death he did on the cross
[25:58] where he died for us and then we look at
[26:00] our own disappointments in life and our
[26:02] own things that we've done in like Oh
[26:04] Lord you know I should have done this
[26:07] you called me to do this he and I went
[26:09] and did this being all that that God is
[26:11] still has said but I will not leave you
[26:14] nor forsake you
[26:15] Amen my mercies and my you're my loving
[26:18] kindness and my tender mercies will
[26:19] never leave you nor forsake you amen why
[26:23] because God has chosen us he says I your
[26:25] your you will describe the life of
[26:28] Christ on this earth it's already been
[26:30] written when God calls a man he fills
[26:33] with His Holy Ghost he has this that man
[26:35] is going to fulfill the life of Christ
[26:37] on this earth amen so whenever God
[26:39] starts pulling on your heart when God
[26:41] first starts tugging at you when God
[26:43] first starts drawing you what's God
[26:45] doing he's testifying I got your name
[26:47] written upon the Lamb's Book of Life
[26:49] why is God tugging you why is God
[26:52] calling you because he wants to express
[26:54] his own life through you on this earth
[26:58] amen and when when you when when you
[27:00] first get in it what it sets you in an
[27:02] expectation Amen that the same
[27:05] experiences that the same experiences
[27:07] that Jonah went through the same
[27:09] experiences that Elijah went through the
[27:11] same experiences that all the Old
[27:13] Testament Saints went through now it's
[27:15] our turn to go through the same
[27:16] experiences why because we're testifying
[27:18] in the same life amen amen amen it's
[27:25] just like in Hebrews chapter 11 you read
[27:27] through though they were they were they
[27:30] wandered about in sheepskins and
[27:31] goatskins being all along they are
[27:33] testifying they had God leading them to
[27:35] us we won't even know it's like just
[27:38] like jesus said that in the last at the
[27:42] judgement time that that
[27:44] and many will come that Jesus say that
[27:47] when I was sick you took care of me when
[27:49] I was in prison you came and visited me
[27:51] and the bride heard the Bride of Christ
[27:53] will rise up and say when did we ever do
[27:56] that when did we ever do this we don't
[27:58] remember that he said but God the Holy
[28:01] Spirit was leading them to do this they
[28:03] didn't remember doing it they didn't do
[28:05] it out of but just all sudden God put
[28:07] the thought on their mind and they went
[28:09] and did it and then they forgot about it
[28:11] but God God's Holy Spirit was walking
[28:14] through them leading them guiding them
[28:16] why is it everyday you submit yourself
[28:18] to the Holy Ghost and when you get up
[28:20] there all sudden you begin to realize
[28:21] that all along that you were doing the
[28:24] will of God all along and didn't realize
[28:25] it Amen that's how the bride is we
[28:28] always think oh I wish I could do these
[28:30] great big and mighty things but if you
[28:33] just day by day submit yourself to the
[28:35] Holy Spirit amen it pays off at the end
[28:38] amen it pays off at the end amen Psalms
[28:43] 143 amen verse 4 it says
[28:49] therefore is my spirit overwhelmed with
[28:52] in me the heart within me is desolate I

[28:57] all thy works I mused on the works of
[29:00] thy hands I stretched forth my hands

[29:26] me is overwhelmed David was in a bad
[29:28] spot well there's one thing about David
[29:31] is that he knew that whenever he got to

[29:38] where to go he went to God Almighty he
[29:40] went to the throne he went to the altar
[29:41] and he went and he prayed before God

[29:46] quiet before the Lord God will hear my
[29:48] prayer
[29:49] Daten one thing about David's he knew
[29:52] the power of prayer he knew if I could
[29:53] just get to that place to where God will
[29:56] hear me that all
[29:58] problems will be taken care of he was an
[30:00] expectation he knew how to be an
[30:03] expectation before God when he got so
[30:05] trouble in his mind when he got so
[30:07] distraught so so so dismayed when he got
[30:10] so low he knew that he could turn to the
[30:12] Lord and his expectation is the guy will

[34:31] years of looking for that life she
[34:33] finally got that answer of life restore

[34:54] Calvary actually has to come to a place
[34:56] where that comes to comes to fruition in
[34:59] your life there's got to remember you
[35:01] know Christ had something in his mind
[35:04] for you on Calvary when Jesus Christ was
[35:08] dying on the cross he had you in his
[35:10] mind and he had your life in his mind
[35:13] and he died that you might express his
[35:16] life on the earth therefore he has a
[35:19] walk waiting for you amen he has
[35:22] something waiting for you to do he has a
[35:24] walk waiting for that you might be
[35:26] quickened by his Holy Ghost so you
[35:28] cannot walk your waste but you can walk
[35:30] in his ways a man so you can no longer
[35:32] walk in your sins me you can walk in his
[35:34] righteousness amen Jesus Christ has a
[35:37] walk for you he has a walk waiting for
[35:40] you
[35:40] amen and and all all the all of heaven
[35:44] and earth is waiting for you to

[35:49] until you first die to yourself at the
[35:51] altar
[35:52] amen until you first go through these
[35:54] steps like David did hear he said hear
[35:56] me cause me deliver me teach me then

[36:02] amen just like we say you know Lord I
[36:06] repent of my sins Lord I've been
[36:07] baptized into your name or fill me with
[36:10] your life
[36:10] then I can go teach others your ways
[36:12] then I can now I've been watching my
[36:15] sins now I can go bring healing to
[36:17] others now I can go let's turn over to
[36:20] Isaiah chapter 60 like we read the other
[36:23] day
[36:35] Isaiah s Isaiah 60:1 Jesus quoted this
[36:43] here remember Jesus went to the
[36:47] synagogue he opened up the scroll and
[36:49] all the Sadducees and the Pharisees the
[36:53] Jews were watching him to see what he'd
[36:55] say and he opens up to this verse right
[36:57] here in the Old Testament he starts
[36:59] reading from Psalm 661 he says the
[37:03] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[37:05] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[37:07] preach good tidings unto the meek he has
[37:10] sent me to bind up the brokenhearted he
[37:13] hath to proclaim Liberty to the captives
[37:14] and the opening of the prison to them
[37:17] that are bound to proclaim the
[37:19] acceptable year of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:21] stood here on the earth crying out in
[37:24] the midst of the church those words and
[37:26] you know what the thing was he didn't
[37:28] just say it he did it
[37:30] amen there are people they were
[37:32] brokenhearted they had their hearts
[37:34] bound up hey man there are those that
[37:36] were in prison that were found
[37:37] themselves set free
[37:38] amen there were those that were there
[37:40] were there were there were meek and
[37:41] lowly and he and he rose them up they
[37:44] had the gospel preached to him amen
[37:46] so now in our day all of us have been
[37:48] called to fulfill these same scriptures
[37:50] we all ought to be able to if we're if
[37:52] we call ourselves a Christian we'll be
[37:54] able to stand up and say the Spirit of
[37:56] the Lord God is upon me
[37:57] amen he has anointed me to preach the
[38:00] gospel amen he has known only me to
[38:02] preach the gospel to the court to the
[38:04] meek to the lonely Amen he has caused me
[38:07] to bind up the brokenhearted amen he
[38:09] didn't call us to be brokenhearted he
[38:11] called us to bind up those that were
[38:13] brokenhearted
[38:14] amen so if you find yourself on this
[38:16] life's journey brokenhearted remember a
[38:18] Christ didn't call you to be like that
[38:19] when he said when he is dying on the
[38:22] cross he didn't see you as being
[38:23] brokenhearted
[38:24] Amen he didn't see you as being bound up
[38:26] he didn't see you as being in prison he
[38:29] didn't see you as being bound by your
[38:31] sins Amen he saw you alive and living a
[38:34] life by the full of the Holy Ghost
[38:36] that's what Christ saw on Calvary that's
[38:38] what He died for amen if we fall short
[38:41] of that
[38:42] then we got to go back to Calgary to
[38:44] meet him there amen because that's where
[38:46] he died for us to fulfill that a man so
[38:50] if you missed that mark then just come
[38:52] right back to Calvary he is waiting
[38:54] right there
[38:54] Amy he's waiting right there for you to
[38:56] come down off your high horse he's
[38:58] waiting for you right there to come back
[39:00] to Calvary all over again so you can
[39:02] repent of your sins all over again and
[39:05] you can be filled with the the
[39:06] fulfillment of what Christ meant for you
[39:08] to do on this earth a man because God
[39:12] didn't call us to be lukewarm God didn't
[39:14] call us to be brokenhearted he didn't
[39:16] call us to be bound up and in prison he
[39:18] didn't call us to have bad habits a man
[39:21] he didn't call us to have things we
[39:22] couldn't get set free from a man he
[39:24] didn't call us to to be bound up by our
[39:28] dirty habits or things like that he cost
[39:30] me set free from all those things and
[39:32] he's waiting at Calvary for us to lay
[39:34] those things down a man of God ever
[39:37] called you oh one time then he is still
[39:40] waiting at Calvary for you right now
[39:43] amen if ever one time he called you then
[39:46] he is still waiting because this is
[39:48] still the day of grace amen if we
[39:52] haven't stumbled too far a man if he if
[39:55] you're here in this church God called
[39:57] you here for a reason
[39:58] amen but if your hair in this church God
[40:01] placed you here for a purpose a man he's
[40:03] waiting for you to fulfill that purpose
[40:05] hey man but until you have the Holy
[40:08] Spirit walking in inside of you and
[40:10] you're walking in step by step by spirit
[40:12] you cannot fulfill that purpose but
[40:14] Christ is waiting at Calvary for all of
[40:16] us amen when we get out of the way amen
[40:20] amen just like Jonah I can imagine them
[40:24] saying every day oh why am I like this
[40:26] why am I like that but you know you know
[40:28] the there is an arrestee thing about the
[40:30] judgment you know we know that there's
[40:32] going to be a judgment some day a meant
[40:35] one day some day there's gonna the books
[40:38] will be open amen and all will be
[40:42] gathered together up up up in heaven and
[40:45] the books will be having it open and the
[40:47] judgment will be set and the Bible says
[40:51] that the word is going to judge the
[40:53] earth by Baal
[40:56] says christ is going to judge the earth
[40:58] the bible says the father is going to
[41:01] judge the world well the bible also says
[41:04] that the Bride of Christ is going to
[41:07] judge the world so now with all this
[41:10] this judgment going on now first off the
[41:12] word is going to judge the world how
[41:13] much how many things in this world are
[41:16] contrary to what the word says there's a
[41:19] lot of judgment that needs to go on amen
[41:23] there's a lot of judgment that's going
[41:24] to happen this world is in for a rude
[41:27] awakening when when all of a sudden
[41:29] everybody's caught up to explain
[41:31] themselves for how they have dealt with
[41:34] this word of God that God has given us
[41:36] amen how many times has this Bible been
[41:39] taken in and someone has read the
[41:41] scripture and someone's been healed or
[41:43] delivered or some miracle or sign and
[41:46] wonder has happened on the earth all
[41:48] those things are done for signs and
[41:49] wonders when brother branham's sit up on
[41:52] the stage and he'd say you over there in
[41:54] the red shirt you were just praying and
[41:56] you were praying for your brother that's
[41:58] over in Minnesota that he would be
[42:00] healed from his cancer well now who told
[42:03] brother Branham that how did that happen
[42:06] God was making a sign in wonder in our
[42:09] day in the midst of a lukewarm day God
[42:11] is making a sign in wonder so that we
[42:13] will be without excuse and why are we in
[42:15] this church why because we saw that sign
[42:17] in wonder and we said that's right
[42:19] that's true God is the same yesterday
[42:21] today and forever and we saw the message
[42:23] of brother Branham we saw that Street
[42:25] one brother Bantu he came to bring back
[42:27] the word to open it up so that somebody
[42:30] could could walk step in step with this
[42:33] word that's what the message is for
[42:36] that's what we were here for we're here
[42:38] to walk step in step with the revealed
[42:40] word for our hour and if we miss that we
[42:43] miss everything
[42:45] amen amen so what so what so what's the
[42:47] message of brother Branham here to do
[42:49] for us it's to come line us up exactly
[42:51] with what the Word of God why so we can
[42:54] escape the judgment that's coming upon
[42:56] the earth
[42:56] Amen judgment is coming upon the earth
[42:58] amen so so when judgment is set the
[43:02] Bride of Christ will be there now why is
[43:04] the Bride of Christ on the right side of
[43:06] the judgment because she's already been
[43:09] judged
[43:09] she's already placed all of her sins
[43:12] underneath the blood of Christ amen
[43:15] they're underneath the mercy seat she's
[43:16] she's taking her sins she said Lord I
[43:19] repent of my sins lord she's judged her
[43:21] sins right there right here right now
[43:24] now is the time of salvation now is the
[43:27] time of repentance and so she taking all
[43:29] of her sins that she's repenting of him
[43:30] Lord forgive me Lord forgive me like we
[43:33] do every day
[43:34] Laura forgive me I shouldn't have done
[43:35] this I should have done that and we're
[43:37] taking our sins we're taking our
[43:38] shortcomings we're placing them
[43:40] underneath the blood a man we're keeping
[43:42] the way clean so we can be without spot
[43:44] without Rico
[43:45] amen and we keep doing that over and
[43:47] over again now it's not that we're
[43:49] supernatural it's not that we have the
[43:51] super flesh that is not tempered all the
[43:54] septum tations all of us have weaknesses
[43:57] all of us have these things that we
[43:59] stomachs like we stumble into but Ron
[44:01] said our flesh is sticky a man it's just
[44:03] like a sheep you know a sheep as the
[44:06] stickiest fur of any other creature
[44:08] practically birds and everything it's
[44:11] hard to keep a sheep clean it's hard
[44:14] keeping us cheap clean but God has a way
[44:16] of keeping the Sheep clean amen
[44:18] because a sheep is sticky you know
[44:20] everything will collect into that but
[44:21] God has a way of keeping the Sheep clean
[44:23] and what is he doing you bring you will
[44:25] bring her there he will bring her there
[44:27] without spot without wrinkle amen and so
[44:30] and so when the judgment is set and
[44:32] we're sitting with God in his throne we
[44:36] don't have to go through the judgment
[44:37] again we have already bypassed the
[44:40] judgment Amen we don't have to we don't
[44:43] have to be judged again because we've
[44:45] already our sins have already been
[44:46] judged hey man we don't have to go
[44:48] through the judgment again
[44:50] a man so so now so now when when all of
[44:53] all at the white throne judgment
[44:55] everybody's coming up to be judged I
[44:57] hear we are sitting with Christ and just
[44:59] strong and though as the word is open
[45:02] you know and someone comes up and says
[45:04] you know I just couldn't live for your
[45:06] Lord I tried but I just couldn't do it
[45:09] and glory could look her over a member
[45:11] of his bride right there and say you
[45:13] know you went through the same thing
[45:14] when you were on the earth how did you
[45:16] overcome that and the bride will say I
[45:18] just trusted in you and you provided the
[45:21] power
[45:22] I couldn't overcome the
[45:23] thing I tried I tried and finally I just
[45:25] turned it over to God and you delivered
[45:28] me by your power by your mercy and your
[45:30] grace and the person standing there that
[45:32] the white throne doesn't believe without
[45:34] excuse because the Bride of Christ will
[45:37] be standing right there and she will
[45:38] have gone through every temptation every
[45:42] single trial every single temptation as
[45:44] is common to the earth you know you go
[45:47] through as you know as I've traveled
[45:48] I've I have met people who have gone
[45:51] through all manner of temptation you
[45:53] know those tell you different
[45:55] testimonies and things that they've gone
[45:57] through and and there's people there
[46:00] members of the Brian Christ have gone
[46:01] through some wicked stuff they've been
[46:03] through some hard times
[46:05] amen they've been weak in the flesh
[46:07] they've done things I shouldn't have
[46:08] done be at God and His mercy and His
[46:10] grace has reached down and grabbed them
[46:13] amen remember we were talking about the
[46:15] we broke down the word loving-kindness
[46:17] amen loving kindness the word
[46:20] loving-kindness as he said there in
[46:21] Psalms 103 that he crowns us with
[46:24] loving-kindness and tender mercies and
[46:26] the word loving-kindness to me is like a
[46:28] man that goes to someone that's lower
[46:30] than him and picks him up and raises
[46:33] them up and considers him an equal side
[46:36] by side with him he is the flesh of his
[46:38] flesh bone with their bone
[46:40] maybe he puts his arm around him and
[46:42] considers them an equal that's what God
[46:43] is loving kindness has reached down in
[46:46] the sin the muck and the mire has
[46:48] grabbed us pull this up he's put his arm
[46:51] around him he's watched us he's cleansed
[46:53] us he's forgiven us of our sins he's
[46:55] baptized us in his name he's fills with
[46:58] His Holy Ghost amen that's crowning us
[47:00] with his loving-kindness he's placed us
[47:03] on the same Saint stay with him you know
[47:06] it's like we say you know a horse
[47:07] marries a horse a cow are you both you
[47:12] know but but who does God marry if God
[47:16] has a bride he can only marry a god a
[47:19] man so he's picked us up and he's put
[47:21] his own life inside of us amen amen in
[47:26] the tender mercies you know as we said
[47:27] the tender mercies was had to do with
[47:30] like as a as a woman that was pregnant
[47:33] with a child would caress her her belly
[47:36] you know that word has to do with caress
[47:37] see the tender mercies the same thoughts
[47:40] that a woman would have towards her
[47:41] unborn child that love that she'd have
[47:43] that's the same love that God crowns us
[47:45] with a man has tender mercies a man
[47:49] that's the same thing that God has
[47:50] towards us how did how did we escape the
[47:53] judgment because we submit ourselves
[47:54] underneath his loving kindness and his
[47:56] tender mercies amen and he forgave us of
[47:59] our sins amen all manner of sin they'll
[48:03] be in the Bride of Christ
[48:04] we'll be taken care of amen why because
[48:07] we came to the house of correction
[48:09] amen amen a David he knew how to pray
[48:13] amen wash me cleanse me
[48:16] he's always constantly whenever his
[48:18] enemies start getting the best of him
[48:19] he'd always find himself right back at
[48:21] the altar Lord deliver me and the Lord
[48:24] Lord delivered him and delivered him and
[48:26] delivered him delivered every single
[48:28] time and now we here are been written on
[48:31] the same book of life that he's been
[48:33] written on we can experience the same
[48:35] thing that he experienced a time after
[48:38] time God has delivered us and delivered
[48:40] us and delivered us the the habits of
[48:42] life the things are too hard for us to
[48:44] get away from God has set us free why
[48:47] because he came to set the captives free
[48:49] man a man he didn't come that we should
[48:51] be bound year after year after year no
[48:53] he came so we can lay these things down
[48:55] and be set free amen because he didn't
[48:59] call us to be carnal amen amen
[49:02] that's what Calvary did for us Amen if
[49:05] we miss that we got to come right back
[49:07] to Calvary
[49:08] amen amen he's waiting for you there
[49:12] amen amen
[49:16] Mary and Joseph you know and when Mary
[49:19] had to go and tell Joseph as she was
[49:22] with child you know how can I get how
[49:25] can I get Joseph to believe me leave the
[49:28] story and as Joseph as he had to
[49:30] consider you know what am I going to do
[49:32] this woman that I was going to get
[49:34] married to his has a child and I want to
[49:37] believe her story but I just you know
[49:40] how how can I really believe the story
[49:42] how can this really be true and and and
[49:45] you know I can just imagine all the
[49:47] thoughts going through his mind where he
[49:49] he wanted to believe her
[49:51] but he but he just couldn't seem to
[49:54] bring himself to believe what she was
[49:56] telling about the angel that came and
[49:58] visited her and told her that she would
[50:00] be with the son called Jesus and he just
[50:03] couldn't seem to grasp it couldn't seem
[50:05] to grab ahold of it and so what do God
[50:07] in His mercy God and his tender mercies
[50:11] came down and revealed it to him right
[50:13] there but it's hey was spoke to him and
[50:15] said don't you fear to take Mary to me
[50:19] why but he was gonna put the word was
[50:21] being born inside America he was gonna
[50:23] put the word away he was gonna shot
[50:25] right when he isn't getting ready to
[50:27] reject the word God and His mercy came
[50:30] down and had him accept the word right
[50:33] when he was getting ready to reject the
[50:35] word God had in his mercy came down and
[50:37] received the word amens the same thing
[50:39] for us God is always waiting if you ever
[50:41] get off the off the line off over here
[50:43] off over there that God and his tender
[50:46] mercies will come down and stop you
[50:47] right there
[50:48] amen yes probably what he's doing right
[50:50] now amen because this is the house of
[50:54] correction
[50:55] amen amen wherever you find yourself out
[50:58] of the way just come right back here to
[50:59] Calvary he's waiting for you right here
[51:01] amen he's waiting for you right there he
[51:04] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[51:05] you amen amen why because he had
[51:09] something in his mind when he died for
[51:11] us at Calvary so we gotta go back to
[51:13] Calvary to get locking step with
[51:15] whatever he had in his mind for us to
[51:17] fulfill a man because we don't want to
[51:19] miss what he had in life for us amen
[51:24] amen I think it of the brother singing
[51:27] this morning you know you know you can't
[51:29] sing a song until you've gone through
[51:31] something you know and nobody can ever
[51:33] really sing a song until you've been
[51:35] through something you know once you've
[51:37] been through something then you can sing
[51:38] a song about it you know as you as we
[51:41] you know I've preached several times
[51:43] about the the hymns that we sing you
[51:46] know when we sing just a closer walk
[51:47] with thee you know well you gotta go
[51:49] through something to need to want that
[51:51] first of all you have to have had a walk
[51:53] with them in the first place to desire
[51:55] walk with them amen amen and you have to
[51:58] be missing some part of that walk to be
[52:01] a yearning down on the inside to want
[52:03] you to desire more of that
[52:05] but just as much as there is a yearning
[52:07] and a desire for a closer walk with God
[52:09] that means that if there's a deep call
[52:11] for that and there's got to be a deep
[52:13] response for it
[52:14] Amen just because just just the mere
[52:17] fact that you're desiring that closer
[52:19] walk with God means that God has a
[52:21] closer walk for you
[52:22] amen amen no we're seeing a Isle enter
[52:26] into his gates with Thanksgiving I will
[52:28] enter into his courts with praise that
[52:29] means he has some gates for a stager
[52:31] into a man he has some the courts of the
[52:35] holiest place for us to enter he has
[52:37] something for eternity and he don't have
[52:39] to enter in downcast
[52:40] he has a joy free to train with him amen
[52:44] I will enter into his gates with
[52:46] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[52:48] praise amen either is going to be a
[52:51] meeting in the air and the sweet sweet
[52:53] by-and-by there's good there's a meeting
[52:55] here for us amen sometimes I think about
[52:58] you have to shake yourself and remind
[53:00] yourself of the ages that we're living
[53:02] in God sent us a problem how many
[53:06] generations have had a prophet Sentinel
[53:08] how many generations didn't get a
[53:11] prophet you know but God in His mercy
[53:14] sent a prophet to us in this age and
[53:16] what'd he do he point us right back to
[53:19] Christ and plain revealed Christ all
[53:22] over again
[53:23] so we didn't have to live in the dry
[53:25] dentists of this denomination we'd have
[53:28] to live live a Lutheran Church walk we
[53:31] didn't have to live a Catholic Church
[53:33] walk we didn't have to live a
[53:34] Pentecostal Church walk we didn't have
[53:36] to live a Methodist Church walk but we
[53:39] got to live with Christ amen we get to
[53:43] live with Christ amen and what and now
[53:46] that message has got come and gone now
[53:48] 50 years what does that mean that means
[53:50] we're at the end time amen we're at the
[53:54] end time a prophet like that cannot come
[53:56] without something coming right after
[53:58] amen something has to happen amen
[54:02] Israel's back in their homeland
[54:04] amen she's surrounded by enemies all
[54:07] around you know the Bible says the ones
[54:09] days that Jerusalem being compass we're
[54:11] roundabout with enemies amen and that
[54:14] everybody will hate her Amen I just read
[54:17] the other day that
[54:18] that uh there the the Muslim countries
[54:21] were proposing getting together a joint
[54:24] army there they pull all their armies
[54:27] together they say we got 51 Muslim
[54:29] countries here or how every country is
[54:31] there and they each have their own army
[54:32] if we pool our resources together we
[54:35] could wipe the Israel off the face of
[54:36] the earth
[54:37] that's fulfillment of prophecy you know
[54:40] and it's going to happen they're gonna
[54:41] try it but they won't succeed
[54:43] Amen why because it's also been written
[54:46] in the word that they will not succeed
[54:48] amen we're living at the end time as
[54:50] prophesied in the last days that Israel
[54:53] will go back to their homeland waiting
[54:54] for the Messiah and she's done I now
[54:56] it's been 70 years since that's happened
[54:58] and we were still living in the last
[55:00] days a member right on the right on the
[55:02] cusp of who's coming one of these days
[55:04] the Bride of Christ will disappear off
[55:06] the face of the earth it won't be long
[55:09] three and a half years after that Christ
[55:11] will come back to the earth if the
[55:13] rapture happens today and that means in
