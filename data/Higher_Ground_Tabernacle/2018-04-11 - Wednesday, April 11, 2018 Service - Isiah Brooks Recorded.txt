tonight but I give you the best I can give you by God's grace in second chronicles were coming from second chronicles the fifth chapter 13 and 14 verse [Applause] 1350 of second chronicles 13th and 14th first yeah we're such a blessed people I say that a lot because I really believe that and you know to think that God would have grace and mercy on us it's glorious because God and it's this last day the most evil age of all ages like I heard somebody said the other day no pressure no diamond pressure comes to make a diamond and God is looking for some diamonds here would it be the greatest of all stones I believe that second chronicles 5 we're going to read the 13th verse it came even to pass as the trumpet ears and singers were as as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to Minister by reason of the cloud for the cloud of the Lord had filled the house of God let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us and we have been to ourselves saw our Father we say that all the time but Lord it is so true we reverence you we respect you Lord we lift up your Holy Name we thank your father because you know what we are without you Lord with just worms or God we're just flesh that is just just worthy Lord to be destroyed Lord but by your amazing grace O God you have brought us into your family by your quickening power and so God we thank you Lord because it was your choosing and not ours Lord will spend eternity thinking your father because eternity won't be long enough you've been so good to us Lord whatever your perfect will is for us in our lives so let it be and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated we realize this evening that this whole thing that we are now experiencing in this world was caused by disbelieving one word and the prophet of God said that in order for us to make heaven we must believe every word we know but by God's grace that none of us in ourselves can make heaven if God had not made the way for us we would all be condemned I like to entitle this message his mercy endureth for ever but I like to also have a sub topic or theme unbelief is the yoke of bondage remember Amen when you yoke with something that means you put together by some kind of instrument like when they would yo courses together yoke cows together and most of the time when something was yoke it was like an agency of oppression something that would be when that place you in a place of subjection you know you when you talk about a yoke you in servitude you know it's a bondage an unbelief places us in bondage because the Bible said he whom the Sun is set free it's free indeed I was thinking about the scripture in second chronicles when the Lord gave it to me I I heard one thing more than one thing I I saw where they were on one Accord they had one voice and everybody there was there to praise God there was nobody there that we're trying to get personal recognition but they were all in one Accord kind of like on the day of Pentecost when the power of God came down and they filled a room and filled each and every one of them that was in that house that room and so when I think about the mercies of God I know one thing for sure we all needed I don't care how long you been saying you need the mercies of God when we talk about mercy we must understand that mercy is when you found guilty and somebody has compassion on you they're willing to pardon you even though you're wrong y'all know what I'm saying and you must understand that that is applicable to every man because if I were says is there any righteous no not one so without the mercy of God we can look it says oh oh but nor was a great man but you understand he found grace and mercy in the eyes of the Lord we talked about Enoch and how Enoch walked with God but Enoch found grace and mercy he could not have done what he did if God hadn't done it with him in for him and all that God asked for from Enoch was his will alright cuz you got to understand you know as long as we do our will we become failures as long as we do his will we become victorious and one thing about God is that he is so merciful he just doesn't want us to be yoked he want us to be free right the Bible says in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy and when joy is not there something has you yoked somewhere you have walked in your own will and not in the ways of the Lord I think about mercy and how God had mercy on Abel the Bible said that God revealed unto Abel the sacrifice how else would he have known right and the prophet of God said one of these old days we're going to realize how much we needed revelation revelation is our overcoming power first of all you got to realize and have a revelation of who you are right I'm gonna try to tried not to go so fast but when mercy is given you are you and I know that it is a for an example if you come to trial and you have a judge and he's heard all of the things that you've done and and he's seen where you you're guilty is at his discretion he's the with the verdict and if he wants to have mercy it's up to him because sometimes judges are spiritual and they can see beyond all of the facade and everything else and they can see that really this man didn't really intend to be them you know he just had a bad deal of cards in life and at that point in time he may say Aloha I'm gonna let him I'm gonna give him some time but I'm gonna cut it in half right that's when he mitigates the verdict he lightens it and you and I must realized by God's grace that Bible said all have come short of the glory of God see when Israel knew and they were getting ready to worship God they understood they have not been a good nation they were not such a good example for God to use every time God trusted in him gave them blessing they back slid Israel piers are here here the Gentiles in this age had one prophet Israel had numerous of prophets and guess what they did to them kill them destroyed them shut up their ears right look what they did to Jeremiah look what they did to Isaiah hallelujah and God still had mercy hallelujah and they were guilty but you see God even made a promise to Abraham and David I'm gonna deal with you sons as children i'ma spank them but I will not destroy them hallelujah I don't care about the spanking if I need a spanking spank me Lord but just don't destroy me let your mercy be with me right Lord and when I fall short in unbelief because all of us will have believed the word and often time we think we do believe it is that right remember that young lady in Midtown who was a part of the Church of Christ and how God healed her and she was about I think brother man said about 47 pounds because of associate disease that her uncle gave it gate to her and God healed her but then there was another girl belonging to the same organization who's had bad kidneys needed a kidneys plant transfuse me our operation and they were gonna send her about so many miles away but brother Branham saw by God's grace that she would not have been made the trip so he went there to see the girl and she's old brother I got faith I know I got faith and he says he knew she did not have it and he told her you won't make the trip if you don't get this faith now you die before you get there he said the parents didn't like him to say that but he said he had to tell them the truth and brother BAM began to show her what faith is real faith I'm saying this because a lot of us think we got it but he says see that light fixture see that thing there hanging if you got faith I want you to move it she says see I don't believe that kind of stuff where is that in the Bible he said I tried to tell he didn't believe it he said but is not it written in the Word of God that Jesus spoke to the tree and it withered and began to build what he was doing opening her understanding and what faith is he went through the thing with the eyes with the touch in the feeling and what's declaring in your sisters what is really there he said faith is that sixth sense but faith is like your touch when you touch it you know what it is or when you see it you know what it is you have something because your senses have declared it's real and is there that's what faith is and when the prophet of God to move that thanks she says that that uh she didn't say which crap well she said that some mmm what's that word kind of like telepathy whatever they he said it was it was like okay this is not accepted that's not God right and you know we find out by God's grace she said well who did it did God do it all the devil he said neither I did it see faith can move mountains the Bible says right the faith of a mustard seed can move a mountain not a mountain of trouble a mountain he was on the Mount of Olives when he spoke that see this mountain if you say to this mountain be that move the mountain must move why because it cannot be hybrid it with unbelief it's a pure seed right so he goes on to the explain and he didn't finally sees all around I really see what you're saying now I really lord help me help my unbelief basically I see it but lord I believe it but lord help me and instantly God the probably God pray for her and she was healed hallelujah you see faith is something that God gives you it's not emotional it's real it's just as real as your eyes as real as your ears right it's so real Amen that you know you've got what you have is not something that you have to work up to get it it's like the Bible says after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall receive power well in the Pentecostal Ram we thought we had to have power as work it up but it's not power as such it is Authority which is totally different the way you work with Authority and the way you work with power is two different things two different ways Authority you don't have to be nothing but who you are you love the Lord now listen what he says now all of us have been failures at time and maybe even today you benefit I'm sorry I love eight minutes cuz you know what it exposes it - hahaha it's the truth hey every day somewhere you fail and you get up brother Brown said we bats not every day I ought to make you feel a little better about yourself to know that God gave you the Holy Ghost knowing you were going to steal backslide with it listen when he says anything what is what is that in your hand he said that maybe man here this afternoon maybe ministers that's been total failures maybe you've been a housewife maybe you've been as a student at a school and maybe you've been as a child to your parents whatever you have been - let that be a has-been I've been that today and today is finished that was yesterday whatever it's in the past and start from today no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you have failed to go on with God if it has been take note - what I'm going to say just in a few moments about this Moses failed down in Egypt when he was born to be a deliverer to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt why because he did it in himself he took it upon himself to do it and anytime you take things upon yourself and leave God out then you're going to be a failure like Moses was he thought he can do it seeing an Egyptian beating him beating in an Israelite so he just killed him and covered him up and that's what we do we make a mistake and try to cover it up but God sees it all right and when he did it he become a refugee in another land over in the land of Ethiopia went over there and he had married a wife got him a job herding sheep and he married Jethro the priest of Midian he married his daughter and there was two children born to him and he got a common laborer a job a sheep herder and have been herding sheep for 40 years because he failed to put God first see how long that kind of thing can last the failure the thing you have to ride that horse for 40 years if I could see it like that think that what's been the matter with the church's brother when it gets to a place that we put our church first instead of Christ we've gone right straight down when you put them as an individual put your church first your social life first instead of your spiritual life you're going to fail in other words spiritual life comes first that all right now listen there's a difference between mercy and grace mercy according to the prop of God is when you caught in the act and you know of course people are lenient and they give you a little mercy now grace is mixed in there too you know but grace is unmerited you know there is no I'm guilty grace is given there is nothing amen on this side that can judge you because he is unmerited favor unconditional love you understand what I'm saying now so it's no matter what you do I've already decided to justify you right so is that kind of a thing listen remember the young man who who are I think he betrayed our country and they were gonna kill him and and the mother came in there crawling on her knees and saying pardon my son but she was asking for mercy no he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty but I I'm asking for your favor and so we realize amen because he didn't receive the pardon he didn't receive the favor and therefore he was guilty and he had to be killed even though there was a part in there for him see what I'm saying so you and I must understand that when there's a different dream mercy and grace and understand this you and I are birth under grace you and I amen the grace of God has already from the foundation of the world said no matter what you're going through what you got to encounter you still make heaven see that that's with me that's hard for us to understand it really is hard for us to understand because we always want to help God now don't get me wrong you say what do you mean brother Brooks listen did not Peter deny God three times Judah betrayed him once Peter betrayed him three times hello but God in his mind had already determined Peter is going to be us the spokesman on the day of Pentecost it makes you can't comprehend it I'm just trying to tell you there are often time we embodied ourselves our yoke ourselves because we disbelieve we say we don't but we do we owe we yoke ourselves with unbelief because if God has justified us as though we never sinned in the first place why are we accounting sin to ourselves don't get me wrong a real Christian is gonna do their best to live a Christian life they're not going to go out here rioting and painting the city and all that kind of stuff they're gonna live circumspectly do it the best they can to please God those are the kind I'm talking about I'm not talking about people who just figure they can do whatever they want to do and expect to go to heaven all that proves that they're not going to heaven is this okay see you and I must understand that God when we talk about God I'm saying there's been somebody who's taken our place it's not like God is not just God is just and he needed someone he's so just he needed someone to take your place in mine we will be worthy to go to hell hell we would be worthy for torment and everything else everlasting torment right I didn't say eternal I said everlasting we're worthy we weren't guilty but it was amazing grace because God chose to save you y'all hear me and yet that's why that the real believer is supposed to be full of joy because once you see that you're totally free that there is no condemnation going to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and if you got the Holy Ghost amen God has declared you to walk after the spirit read that spell read those scriptures see God made a way for you and me and that's what we need to say Lord there is now no condemnation well I'm gonna condemn myself if somebody has already paid the price Oh somebody go pay a thousand dollar bill for me and I'm over there oh I just wish I could have paid that bill somebody just paid it for me so I can go free and you and I must understand by God's grace that it is it is his mercy endureth forever is that right the scripture said that his mercy so free so full but then said is rich in mercy but it's so he's so full of mercy the Bible said they are renewed every morning so you you do you you you can't run out of it not those who are chosen electing to be ride you cannot run out of it he has blessed you and he's had given you a covenant he hallelujah we on the Abraham's covenant the unconditional covenant oh I'm not saying that when you do bad you don't feel bad no you're gonna feel bad because you don't want to hurt God or disappoint him but God has already seen your repentance before you repented he knows you go with him that's why he gives you the Holy Spirit that's why he calls you hallelujah you didn't choose him he chose you we're not gonna argue with Jesus aren't we lilia no man could come to me except my father draws him first then it was God knocking at your heart not you seeking God it was God seeking you so you see the Covenant is to do is to you also Grace Covenant because it's God God's grace calling you whoo you never chose him he chose you how does amazed in the world today he reached down and chose you hallelujah because he put your name on the lands book of life before the foundation in the world that's what the Bible says before there was a well Jesus was a lamb slain from the foundation world because when God speaks anything is so perfect it has to take place and it it has good as it is as good as done when God speaking hallelujah oh come on somebody he said I am perfect he says you're perfect we're perfect here's examine yourself to see if you're perfect he said examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith if you can believe that you're perfect because of what he's done for you oh my god oh Lord listen he said he he's the trouble the church is scared oh I'm afraid of this don't be afraid you say oh oh if I can just it isn't you it's him I'm not worthy of healing sure you're not I'm not no nobody's not but he's the one is it isn't our worthiness is his goodness to us see the Old Covenant what a little Moo what if a little Mew would be born in a pasture some night and I don't know whether you ever farmed any or not but this meal was born with flopped ears that's a horrible meal to begin with and he's not he's not needed and he's cause I his tail sticks right up straight what a Harbor look at me now if he could look around to his mammy he'd say you know what as soon as the master of the house comes out he will knock me in the head I'm not even worthy of the food I eat I'm no good but if mammy was really instructed she say wait a minute son just a minute I'm going to tell you something you don't know he says that's what I see I want to tell you see you don't know who you are son you see you are born you are born under birth right and when the master of the house I don't care what you look like when the master of the house comes out to see he's got a new mule born then the thing he has to go do is go get a lamb without a blemish and take that perfect lamb and that perfectly I'm dies so you can live then the little mule can kick up his heels and have a big time you see what they say he you and I don't have to worry we came in here ugly like a mule cause I had not need all that hallelujah but God had already provided a way he provided a lamb for you and I are you and me that right Oh tea that's the way it is with us we're imperfect no good born and sin shaped in the nuclear come to the world speaking lies we're no good to begin with but God don't look at you he looks at the sacrifice hey he looks at the lamb he doesn't see you because he sees Christ Jesus died for you and if you can find some fault with Jesus then you your your healing might not be right but if you don't find no fault with him it's perfect your he god call you by His grace not that you would but if God would huh the scripture since he was a lamb slain before the father's in the world that was God's Word when God speaks it is good as finished right there hallelujah that's why the Bible said the words were finished before the foundation of the world it's not God is not surprised at those who are who are unbelievers he understand Amen that there are some people it meant they can't believe like there's nothing in him but you know if you got something that can believe that shows you come from God look what he says he says there he says something down in your heart he said you want to be a Christian but there he's talking to a young man he says but there's something that won't let you be a Christian is that right he says that's it I said that's the devil and that's unbelief and I said you believe that he said yes sir I said do you believe if I ask God to break that power of unbelief above you that you'll be a Christian he said yes sir and I and just that time we bow our heads he let out a scream he jumped up in the air like that and it was gone and the man is a staunch Christian today but you see what we don't understand is that Devils the church unbelieving Devils and they will come and anoint you with some kind of a long belief because you can't process it God never told you the process is what he said believe it that's all we need to do because once we believe it God will perform it hey he see when we understand Abraham's covenant y'all watch it for him he did a lot of little things that he shouldn't have done but Abraham is the father say and God said as he did it to Abraham he would do it to Abraham see hallelujah and if you got the faith of Abraham praise the Lord Amen every blessing of Abraham comes to you he made a covenant with man and then was always breaking it's coning but man was always to try to find some way to save himself trying to make himself he comes from a strain in the Garden of Eden when man realize he has sinned he tried to make himself religion a coveting right see the word religion means covering and Allen East rolled fig leaves together and made him themselves a religion and since then it's been a strain of man down through the ages trying to do something to save himself now I know every one of us is big guilty every one of us been guilty you know why because there's a lack of trust in God if God said he's gonna do it he's gonna do it the problem is we've got our will in the way who got the way and let God have his way let God have his way every tree don't grow to us at the same speed but he promised he they've begun the good work in us it's safer to complete it now you can't complete it he will call the area not one of us can move ourselves up that ladder huh huh hey man how many times you told I'm I have patients and all of a sudden a little niece or nephew or something children or somebody hallelujah lid flies off but when God's get ahold of it but a lot of time he wants us to recognize who we where we are like I was telling her brother today God gave me such a beautiful day of witnessing today and yesterday and I it's God it couldn't be me just like a water fountain with a half flowing and I get praise to God that leads me back that makes me feel good what I can tell somebody about Jesus and they're listening that makes me feel real good so anyway let's go on but you see him what brother man goes on the same but you are saved by grace election God's foreknowledge predestination for day for ordination Paul tell the church Ephesus that God predestinated us in Christ before the foundation well he said think of it predestinated us in Christ before the foundation of the world what we worried about being downing Thomas made it and was one of the Apostles hello oh come on somebody look at Peter even after he got the Holy Ghost he dealt with being prejudiced hallelujah then look at Paul and Peter was it Pauline um Barnabas they fall not this fall but fight but they argue they had a heated argument with the Holy Ghost and Grace save them anyhow now I'm not giving you no tools to justify your faults but I'm trying to tell you by God's grace that in the Grace and eyes of God you are perfect predestinated us in Christ before the valley were we what we worry about being getting away from that worry we're just the happiest creatures you could ever see lot how can you believe that and keep from being happy right how can you really believe you free and you're not happy right he said I used to see old brother Bosworth and he says brother brother branham I said how are you feeling this morning brother Bosworth said the same old trouble back on me brother branham I said the same old trouble what is it he said just so happy I can't sleep hey madam how could I believe that what I believe without being happy help us Lord that's what we ought to do speak it we got a kid might remind ourselves think about where he brought us it features to sense beginning it first verse and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin everybody says amen that's the truth we were all dead in trespasses and sin we're in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience we were slaves whether I was I was truly a slave whatever the devil say do I did it didn't even have time to process it God's mercy and grace is that right oh we're in time past ye walked according the cause of course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation that means our lifestyle in this time past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires and them of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as other God but God I like that word but God it's like when the devil say you're gonna die and you can't live because you've got but God says right how and when the devil said you ain't nothin but a hypocrite but God says hallelujah whenever he brings that distilled but God hallelujah he leaving something out of this equation but God who is rich in his mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us y'all hear me the merge is given to us because he loved us the mom said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us [Applause] hallelujah glory to God yes we ought to say from this day on I'm i'ma do my best to be happy I'm gonna do my bestest to smile and enjoy Jesus oh because I'm free in my eight I may not live I may not live every jot and tittle I desire to live every jot and tittle but you see I had somebody who came before me who lived a jot and tiddle hallelujah and because of his sacrifice I am free you are free Lou you ain't got good even when we were dare to sea and heavy quickness together with Christ by grace ye are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus what you laughing about brother Bruce why are you so happy I'm saying you know people used to understand that one time but now I think they think they've been into this working thing and trying to figure out how to how it's going to happen it's already happened it's a done deal jesus said if you believe on me as the scripture said out of your belly ship for living waters that in the age to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace this age that's what he's doing he's showing in this age the riches of His grace hallelujah in all that we have been in and all that we will be His grace is sufficient Oh riches of His grace and kindness toward us this is juicy this is really good in kindness toward us see God ain't mad at you hallelujah he loves us we favor and God has a right like I said Esther said i'ma go see the king right if I perish I perish but I'm going to see the king and when he got she got that she realized that the King favored her that's what we need to see God favors us but by grace you're saved through faith and that not of yourself whoa it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast halle-loo is that right oh come on y'all remember the parable jesus said that that I think was the Pharisees well there's the whole Lord ever not tied today oh Lord I was not done this the Lord ever done he said with that that Republican he smoked his breasteses law have mercy on me hallelujah with wine was the righteous one the man who knew he needed God's mercy hallelujah God is good and His mercy endures forever hallelujah now that works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship yeah right so that means there's a man working on your ship he is the one that's building and making us right created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in so don't worry God gonna make it happen he ordained it brother he our David y'all know what I'm saying he ordained it that means it gotta happen we don't have to worry who he said and what did he confirm father Abraham he drove Abraham he gave him the Covenant unconditionally not because the Abraham was Abraham he went through that a few weeks ago you know he gave Abraham the company because God himself chose choose Abraham and elected him before the foundation of the world Abraham before he ever was born on the earth God know it all about him know what he would do and by grace he chose Abraham not only Abraham but Abraham's seed after him how far a foundation have we got right we're not only some sinking saying God has given us his word and if you have faith in that word your foundation is firm hallelujah man he said when the Prince of all princes when the God of all gods when the king of all King the Lord of all Lords and beginning of all beginnings himself took an oath hallelujah he said by himself for where there's non greater that he would confirm this covenant with Abraham and with his seed he took it off I'm gonna make it happen hallelujah no we're about it Abraham who has got to happen yeah I'm feeling pretty good was there something on the inside of you y'all know y'all know it even before you came to this message you knew that was always something on the inside of you that really loved and respected car hallelujah brother man who said that was that a little piece of life when I saw that I let me read it to you it's just that good angular just pair afraid I'm gonna read it to you he said now we are part of God you always were you don't remember it because you weren't only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he you what you were god didn't you do you and Bolin huh I didn't know he was going to turn out to be yummy in the odds of God seeing his sin let me say the pot cake called a killer black we all was that dark and blackest whatever no light in us except that attribute that little thing and I know that when I hear brother Branham say that when I'm getting ready to read it does something for me cuz I knew I could remember as a child I knew something was different about me and everybody would treat me that way anyway they treated me like all the curse but that's okay now I realized what it was that they didn't like it was a spirit that didn't like that right they don't double didn't like me kept look at me like but you don't look like you man now he knew I was Gloria God right he says I'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be going to be but now you are sons of God see you always were the sons of God for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before they eat before he even become material here on earth before there was anything but God you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of your hair you would have he known all about you the only thing happen is when when you usually being a sinner see many of you can fellowship with me on the start when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that were just where it would it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was there there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that a man he said now what was that that was that little form of life in you Dan lujah I reveal abort when I was a young man we'd be out there playing basketball and stuff like that and somebody was square in Jesus name it would halt the game everybody would stop you make that right or you go home people include at one time there's a time people respect the gods hey you you know you're gonna talk like that we're gonna get away from you people used to respect God now they use it they make mockery and everything out of it but that person that got a little something on the inside they're not gonna put up with that nonsense why would we allow ourselves to be anything when bondage the game don't let the devil burn you up I'm talking from experience I have this has been the last couple of months it's been one of the most trying months of my life mine battles bad mine battles but I told the devil you know that's exactly where they gonna stay when the devil want me to do something no devil you go do it right so you and I must realize him and that these bother looking about that bow says stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage now he was talking about circumcision remember in Galatians how the Galatians those came in those false brethren came in until tried to tell the Galatians that they the men had to be circumcised right and and there was a group of people that were becoming to coming to a place that they were literally believing that and Paul said wait a minute wait a minute we as Jews couldn't even keep that we weren't faithful into that so don't even try to bind these people up with this ritual well God wasn't even talking about that kind of a circumcision now he's working with the circumcision of the heart suppose they don't let me see that's what I'm trying to say those little rules and regulations just not hate testing touch not taste not handling up Paul says we don't have nothing to do with that so you got to understand it ain't my touching and tasting and handling cuz all that has been finished for me God has paid the price for every fault every shortcoming I would ever have we not to judge one another like that it's the inner man the inner man that's the real man the inner man who was Christ Jesus oh you sure well what did God do what did he do let me tell you something I love it cuz I love to see it like this God really knows how to be bring perfect perfection out of things that is so unperfect only God can do it he's the only one I know that can bring light out of darkness he's the only one he's the only one that can take somebody like you and I and bring perfection it almost seems impossible but I believe it he says listen I testify again to every man so you can understand if you follow the law Amen then you'll be judged by the law and then the grace of God is not affect to you that's what he's trying to tell us see you and I are so faulty we could never be pleasing in God's sight or even our own it took Jesus Christ our Lord who was a perfect man and that's why the vows said we are accepted we love it and if you have been accepted why we carry on like we haven't been is that right didn't brother branham tell us the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind he told us that do you expect that's what I'm saying do you really expect you to get out of it this is the age of the battle this is where Eve had it and she messed up and lost it this is where you see the Albin Omega right whatever he's Sheba saying we will not fail why God is good and His mercy and do it forever right we understand by God's grace hallelujah Amen cuz Adam could not redeem Eve he died for but he couldn't give her life hallelujah why because he wasn't a quickening spirit hallelujah but the Bible said the second Adam he's a quickening spirit he is the lord of heaven oh so when he came he could start for us and he was raised from the dead to declare the resurrection of his bride right is that right is that that isn't that not that right brother said when when Jesus rose from the dead we rose with him we win him and so every victory Jesus got we got it we have it and nothing can take it away from us except your own underneath is this okay Oh everything everything that we you know I love the way God did this thing it's so simple yet so powerful you'll never see a orange tree going to the store shopping for oranges he's got everything he need in him to bring forth oranges he understand me so everything the orange tree needs to produce oranges is already in him because it was in the sea and all that orange tree needed that seed needed was to be watered and plays in a place where the Sun like and that's it you can't ripen yourself you must stay in the presence of the Sun it is the Sun who ripens you I hope you enjoying this people I am everything I need is in him Qi and he said that's the way a Christian is we are pledged together in Christ Jesus who is the in and exhaustible fountain of life we're planted in Christ and we'll just drink and drink and drink push out everything we have need up for the earthly journey divine healing the power of God and all these other things in every individual is is in here that we see the baptism of the Holy Ghost for your planet in Christ hallelujah see the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir everything you have need for this life journey even the rapture is right in you then everything Lord show us the father see and you and I must understand by God's grace you say well what do you mean think about Jacob and I'm not gonna be too much longer Jacob in Genesis 32 it says Jacob said O God my father Abraham god of my father Isaac God of which say it to me returning to that country and to that kindred and I would deal with well with thee see what was it here with Jacob had already shikes it his brother Esau now God who says now you got to go back home and he saw yes and then mm-hmm they didn't come I tell you what I got some phone you got to understand Esau hated Jacob until God intervene when God soft soft and esau hard cause if you read it correctly he saw found out that Jacob was coming he was not going over there to shed share bread and wine he was going to do something to Jacob and Jacob sensed it he knew that Lord you said you're gonna deal well with me but there is a Esau over there right he had way believe it now you said what do you mean because he sent his family out now it's the same thing his daddy did Abraham put he put put his wife Sarah in harm's way because of his own fear and here was the sexy you can't get around with him from the genetic things there is still work folks and so he did the same thing you know and but listen the Bible tells us that you know he says I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and all the truth without has showed unto thy servant for I will my staff I passed over the Jordan and now I become too bad so he said listen and all of my failures you blessed me anyway I am not worthy I came here tonight my father-in-law I came to his country married his daughter married his other daughter I came here by myself but now you blessed me I'm leaving here with two bands I got two groups of folks yeah yeah hear what I'm saying and he said not Lord I'm not even worthy of this but this has been your mercy see it's amazing when you and I can see the mercies of God and bless God for it blessing for it that's what they were doing Lord you are good that's blessing God and Your mercies in doing forever that's blessing God you don't realize what God gives each and every one of us the Holy Ghost so that we can have fellowship and you know what it is God is having fellowship with himself that's why when you fellowship you fellowship around the word because now that word is fellowshiping with the word husband and the wife is having a good time together hallelujah how God is merciful he's full of mercy right hallelujah I got Nehemiah 9 just let me read this and I'll let you go he says listen from the 16th verse 6 birthday and our fathers dealt proudly they talk about Israel what they did harden their necks harden not hearken not to thy Commandments and refused to obey neither were mindful of the wonders that thou didst among them but harden their necks and in their rebellion appointed captains to return them to their bondage right is that not what our church didn't it this last day the prophet of God said there was a time that people would really really got excited about the miracles and the signs and the wonders and things that God did in that day and then he said all of a sudden he said oh it became common to him and then when it became common what did they did they became denominational then they did what by choosing to go in denomination they became back in bondage right remember the same thing God told Samuel Samuel they did not reject me they reject you they rejected me but i'ma show you what this King is gonna do this King is not only gonna have your sons working in servitude you know doing whatever he wants you to do but then he's gonna have your women doing this this this this this did it not happen see whenever you put a king over you outside of the King Christ Jesus you gonna be a slave that's just justice the way it goes he said yeah and when they made the molten calves I said this is I God and brought brought me up out of Egypt and had brought great proof and had brought great provocations yet thou in thy manifold mercy for suka still not in the wilderness the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither did the pillar of fire by night to show them light and the way wherein they should go now gave it also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheld it not that manner from their mouth and gave it them water for yeh 40 years did thou abstain them in the wilderness so they would they like nothing neither clothes wax not o and their feet swelled not 40 years of walking around and your feet wouldn't even swell but to see they were so into themselves they never saw how blessed they were they didn't see it now we can see that you mean to tell me I got clothes that go wear out shoes did not go to wear out you know think about it and these people didn't even pay attention to it and they were rebellious they were always complaining and gods learned she was still with them see that's what God wants us to see he wants us to see his mercy and His grace he wants us to be able to say thank you Jesus God we realize we don't deserve this their children also multiply though is the stars of heaven and brought at them into the land concerning which thou has promised to their fathers that they should go in to possess it and a lot of time we don't never think about it but in that day it wasn't so easy to have children many children died in that day women and children giving birth sure it wasn't so easy they didn't have a c-section if a child went breech the mother sometime died or the baby sometime both of them sometimes see it was just that way but not what they began to multiply children sons healthy uh-huh yeah think about it by the time they come out of that forty years they had millions I'll think about it people that's no joke god blessed him just that well and they didn't think about it so the children went in and possess their land see when God make a problem is he gonna eat that promise it's going to come to pass and though some do it they've before them the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites what I'm trying to say in all of this if God has ordained for you to do something there is nothing out of hell that can stop it nothing your failures won't stop it Moses was a failure he killed that he killed that Egyptian okay he messed up it couldn't stop God said he was the deliverer and that's what he was you mean to tell me God had a murderer for to deliver a year now you look at you should all my goodness and I tell you like this look at Solomon died in a Dollar Tree Solomon saying he did on earth what God wanted him to do and the Prophet God in the message as I was with Moses God said he looks at the Commission and not your failures that's paraphrase but that's what he said not your fault he looks at what you do what you came to do did you do it hmm you sure well I haven't done nothing like I said the other day this little finger I'll keep mine it may not be worth much to you someone else but I'm gonna keep mine and you don't know how important that little thing there is until it's gone that little told me like may not look like it take it off and see how well your balance huh so you got to realize I meant all these little things and I think to myself loaded with it seems so easy and so nice to be able to impact a few loaves of bread and fish and that was it hey man you might just been here just a witness to one soul right wasn't that lady who witnessed a Martin Luther Wesley it was Wesley witness the Wesleyan look at what Wesley became the only man in church service the only man that got saved in that church service and he won millions to the Christ and brother Branham said everyone he warned to Christ that lady is the part of that inheritance I could crown think about it I've always done this is the last scripture he said and you know he said therefore thou delivered them into the hands of their enemy who vex them and in times of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heard at them from heaven and according to that manifold mercy dog gave it them saviors who saved them out of the hands of their enemies I said listen you harden your heart I love the enemy to take you over you repented and I said somebody to deliver you it was still merciful to me even when I turned my back on you that's what he that's what David said he said God was merciful to us his bill even when we turn our backs on now look at the mercies of God I'm almost done you think about I was telling this guy the other day I said all the Jews have gone through was the work because they said when when Pilate said you tried to wash his hand and said the blood is of me and the Jews cried out let that blood let his blood be on us in our children and they've been suffering every sense they curse their own children and in the midst of all of that they cursed Christ because they said listen when you say the blood is on the honest murderer is what they saying they murdered crisis when they said we will take the responsibility of his killing and our children you see and in all that they said God still had mercy God said he ain't gonna be like this I'm not gonna turn my back on Israel that's impossible for me to do right he goes on to said I even got it engraved in my hand I can't turn my back he said that coming a day that I am gonna take when I judged you by scatter do all over the world there's coming today I'm gonna bring you back on eagle's wings where would this country be without the merges and grace of God that he's shown toward Israel your cell phone would not exist your tablet would not exist almost all of our technology is has been because of the Jews and you gotta realize amen nobody ain't messing with Israel because they know Israel got some stuff packing even when it comes to bombs and everything else Israel playing technology they got stuff that you and I don't even know about and the only reason why the Antichrist will be able to kill them because it's written if it wasn't written in there no nobody would be able to touch Israel ya know what I'm sayin so if God you can see what I love this because you can see what God has done through Israel who wasn't so good of an example and yeah there's something yet it gone through it it paying the price but still there's still that remnant that real seed of God that's all gone wait no he's waiting on that 144,000 to be present on earth and once they're there he's got his number y'all you mean it's like the bride once that last member coming we're going up this whole thing the whole world wraps itself around the bride in Israel everything that you see right now every movement that's been made is only positioning the bride to a place because remember brother Graham said that she gonna be tried and tested at every point right you see it all is about like okay what doctrine you believe you've got to denounce this and you got to join this ain't denouncing nothing ain't joining nothing whatever you got to do got to do it you understand me and then when you get to the place Amen that you can love God like that not my will but let die be done you really got something going you really have something going then understanding brothers and sisters it's about the mercies and grace of God and understand he's already fixed it you may not be where you desire to be but if you continue to ask God to help you he said only reason why we have not because we ask not but as long as you continue to ask God gonna bring it y'all understand me that day has an appointed time to manifest itself right because dad you said well I ain't no good but let me tell you something so you can understand if that was the devil in you he will not be asking for God's help huh so that must be God in you that's asking for God's help ain't no devil gonna ask for God's help look at Cain he walked away from God's help but you see a son of God or daughter of God when they constantly asking God for help that's a son that's a daughter that's that life in you knowing it because you're not satisfied with went with where you are okay and the devil don't like that he just doesn't like it but he can't stop it hallelujah let's tan our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I was saying you were say before the foundation of the world hallelujah we're just going through the motions but God has already fixed it just like he had 12 chairs up there waiting for those 12 disciples or 24 elders amen we got our seat - nobody sit in my seat Oh Marcy got my name only hallelujah Oh glory to God in God yes uh yeah I don't know why I say that that tables gonna be miles long I don't know how we gonna see everybody but I know the way God got a plan will be able to see we'll be able to greet in love on each other for however long I don't know but I know one thing god help us and keep us from that yoke of unbelief no matter what God says so and the Bible said if you ask of anything in faith it has to come God don't want you to have something he goes surely tell you and if he says no you rejoice anyway me zing gray how sweet the sound - see like me I
