TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he is such a patient God I thank God for his patience and his mercies longsuffering as we stand let's have a word of prayer Our dear heavenly father God we thank you Father for your Amazing Grace Lord we ask your forgiveness Lord of being late and you know just uh our whole day has been quite busy and a little bit of confusing but uh we thank you for all that you've done and all that you will do for us wash us clean at our thoughts and actions be pure and clean before you Lord bless this little bible study in Your Name Lord may we present uh the word of God with Clean Hands In Your Name Jesus Christ we pray that you bless each and every heart here tonight in your lovely name we pray amen as we stand let us turn to Ephesians please we're going to finish up on Ephesians tonight Lord's will and um I have truly been blessed in in studying it and I don't know I trust that all of you have uh been enlightened some way or another um we're going to come from Ephesians the 6th chapter CH and we're going to start reading from the 11th verse and it reads put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil and that word Wes means trickery for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual Wicked is in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girdled about with truth and having on the bre breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shard with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is of which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching uh there unto with all perseverance and spirit and supplication for All For All Saints and for me that the other an may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mysteries of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that wherein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak but that ye Also may may know my Affairs and how I do uh tius I a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord shall make known to you all things whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that you might know our Affairs and that you may Comfort your hearts peace be unto the brethren in love with Faith from God the father in the Lord Jesus Christ Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity amen you may be seated I just want to uh that 24th verse of the chapter here um where it says Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity amen because uh that is basically what keeps can I say it like this it's it's if there be if there be any fastenings or buttons to basically keep the armor of God on uh an individual it would be the love of the sincere love that we have toward God in studying or in thinking about what what the whole arm of God is I thought to myself that these scriptures were written to every Church age and uh uh I I say it like this um because we had all of these churches we had seven churches of Asia and the letters were basically uh as I have understood uh those letters that were from Paul were passed around you know uh either by word of mouth or or by by by by letter which was um written on on the skins of animals but but my whole uh uh situation here is um when we talking about putting on the whole armor that means something that you do you have to be involved in it's not like somebody's going to put the AR you know we're going to just stretch our arms out here and somebody's going to do it for us but you have to play a part in this um when you think about how we lost our armor because remember uh Adam and Eve in the beginning was fully armored they weren't clothed but they were armored they actually had the protection of the Holy Spirit they had a veil about them um that uh kept them from their nakedness um they had Faith H because remember now Adam was the very expression of God he was when you saw Adam you saw god um that was just the way it is like when you see Jesus you see God it was God um manifested himself to his creation through Adam we lost the battle uh not through Adam but through Eve well let me back it up that's not correct we lost the battle because Eve was deceived D but Adam walked out willfully he willfully sinned in other words there was no way that Adam could have been tricked because Adam had the mind of God Amen he was the very thought of God whatever God was thinking Adam would think what God was thinking that's why he was able to um name the animals I'm saying all of this to bring us to a point putting on the whole arm of God it doesn't mean just the mysteries of your day it means taking everything from Ephesus all the way up to uh uh uh Lea all the way up to the bride amen because remember God is a god of furtherance Amen he's always revealing himself more and more and more and more they may have had just justification the other one may have had sanctification but in this hour the whole armor of God Amen is every attribute of every age amen plus Divine love that's right and we must understand that's the whole armor of God for us Divine love is the only thing that's going to conquer what Satan is putting out in this day amen now the thing about it is Faith you have to believe what God says about you that's right can I say it again you must believe I'm not talking about circumstances you know oh I I got this and and I used to be this and that and the other no no no we're talking about what God is saying to you amen I heard a a brother say when Adam was asleep Eve we you know we call her Eve but she wasn't Eve then she was Adam she was on the inside of Adam and as Adam slept she did sleep too amen and then when God woke up Adam he woke up Eve amen so she was she was Awakening to a Revival herself and and and I know for a fact that when we talk about woman she is she was the actual actual womb of Adam that's why we say woman she is the womb of Adam every woman is the womb of a man cuz a man don't have a w a man can't produce a baby by himself that's why God needed us and we need God Amen you see that's why Adam could not allow Eve to go because that was his only way of reproduction amen that's right even though even though God we know it was by Spoken Word she had a part in it I'm saying all of this is because if Eve would have kept kept to who she her uh Adam said she was she would have never gone with the serpent I'm going to say that again and this is what I'm trying to tell you I'm bringing it to you to us if we can believe what the message have said we are amen we will never uh listen to the voice of the serpent amen we we we got to believe and and Faith come by hearing and and this is what the word of God is when Adam when Eve came uh uh and and and and Adam saw her he declared unto her your bone of my bone and your flesh are my flesh Amen in other words amen we are from the same material amen right and so if we can understand that this is what God is saying to us but you got to believe it amen and this is why it was so important because what happened she took her armor off amen that's right youall understand me she took her arm armor off first of all if she had had that that Shield that Faith Shield the enemy would have never been able to seduce her amen Satan first seduces us in our minds amen that's right and if she had had the armor of God that that that that that that Shield of Faith this is why the Bible said we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but spiritual against principalities understand when Adam said you are woman he was literally placing her in her position amen right when God says your bride amen he's placing you in your position that's right meaning you came from him you go back to him you are a part of him and and he is expecting you to be as as the word is amen believing the word this is why the angel of the Lord told Brother brandom if I can get you if you can get the people to believe all things are possible amen see and brother Bron spent many of his years laying on hands and and and Discerning and then if you I can't remember the message I just listened to it he said he was wrong by doing that even though God honored it amen he said his commission was to get the people to believe amen amen and and it it's not changed God still saying you got to believe one of the things and I I I I I'll get to that any in a minute for Flesh and Blood we for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and and here the devil um God is is actually working with both Dimension he's working with the dimension that we cannot see and he's working with the dimension that we can see amen because remember amen that all principalities all you could let's let's say it like this so you understand me presidents vice presidents all all all the government officials amen you must understand that they are ordained of God but it doesn't mean that they are all God's children that's right and we have spiritual wickedness in high places now Paul knew what he was talking about because he was dealing with Rome right and he un he wanted them to know you don't have to just battle with yourself but you actually got principalities you got powers in high places amen that you're going to have to ra HH be aware of not that these people are that you you must hate oh I hate uh you know uh a president no no no no you must understand that the spirit behind the person is what you're fighting against amen that's right right because you got to respect every office amen the Bible said give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar am and God is the one who lifts ups and brings down that's right right so it doesn't matter whether you like the president or don't like the vice president or Secretary of State God ordained amen hallelujah right and the truth of the matter is that's that's in the natural y'all understand what I'm saying because I'm saying if we would listen to the news it would literally cause us to despise or even hate those that are within office amen regardless of what they're doing you must understand that they are ordained of Goden that's right Hallelujah and God placed them there amen and the best we could do for them is pray for their souls amen right you can't get mad with the cop because he stopped you right and you know that we say oh we going over the speed limit the cop stops us and we say the devil just the devil yeah the devil got on you first amen that's right right cuz you were speeding yeah it ain't the police that's just the devil you allow the because because you didn't have your your your Shield of faith that God is going to take you where you need to be and make it all right even if you're a few minutes late amen like tonight amen right I was home studying I can't say where the devil made me get late so you got to understand all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord we don't r against we you know we have to think we have to think who's attacking me what is attacking me and understand that nothing can attack the bride without permission that's right amen God gives permission and he's expecting you to do what stand like a soldier amen hallelujah wherefore take on you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil days and having done all to stand see what God people don't realize is that the character and the nature of of of divine nature that is God Amen that that is God and the Bible says when all of those virtues are in us we will never fall we'll never fail we we we will stand amen why because we have put on the whole armor amen every portion of that that uh uh uh divine nature might be tried in one inst one instance but yet and still if we are clothed with God if we are strengthened in the Inner Man by these virtues we won't come up short amen right so I'll say this so whenever we come up short you know there's a leakage somewhere there's a leak that's right it's not that seal is not on their tight enough amen and and you got to work you got to do what oh I'm coming to that amen see because you cannot put on the whole arm of God without dying daily am Paul said you have to die to yourself daily now I I'm not talking about your bad habits they going to die when you die right when your heart start beating everything in your body dies amen right so if this thing when you can Surrender Your Life your will your thoughts everything to God getting down on your knees wherever you may be standing up it doesn't matter but Paul says in order to maintain uh uh being a good soldier you must die to yourself and then put him on Amen you got to put him on daily amen oh I had a good time today the Lord was good Sunday what what about Monday what about Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday we get relaxed relaxed after Sunday we we we we let we know we oh I made it no you didn't you got a few more days to go amen it never stops until this stops amen and you got to put on the whole armor this is what he's trying to tell the people Ephesians Ephesus was mature enough to understand what Paul was saying right you got to put on the whole arm of God you can't just put on a few things and expect to make make it through this war this is the this age is the most intense age ever amen that's the truth y'all say well oh no I think when they they had these people killing them and lions and all that no no no no no all of that was God Amen and I heard a brother said I'm going repeat this he said what people don't understand he said even when they they were out there being killed by lions that still was the book of Acts amen Lord and it was it was because there was no human possibility that would C no nothing in the human mind that would make him run toward a lion amen that's right that was the anointing of God that was God showing and proving himself that I'm greater amen and every age he unfolded more of himself to prove that he's greater so he's greater he he had started with the lion then the ox then the man then the eagle it doesn't stop there it keeps going amen she said well that that was just the four living creatures well what are you going to do with the lamb amen when John turned around he heard he he heard the voice of a lion but when he turned around he saw a lamb amen because whether you believe it or not it was the nature of the Lamb that conquered death hell and the grave Hallelujah even though he was a king amen that's why he had to be humble that's why he had to what he had to pray who Jesus amen he had to pray and we know of one prayer father not my will but let thine be done what was he doing dying to himself amen you say oh he didn't have to die to himself yes he did because he said Lord I don't want to do it father I would that this cup passed from me and whenever we get into that place we know what we need to do pray amen some part of us still living you got to pray amen right that's the way it is when you find yourself getting agitated and crossed you got to pray because the old man is rising up and you got to kill him kill him kill him daily sometimes you got to slay him more than one time am it's what it really is this is really a battle but your greatest enemy as brother Adam said is you amen yourself nobody can hurt my feelings better than I can hurt my feelings amen but you say what do you mean when I fail God nobody causing me to fall or fail but me amen when I fail to listen when I failed to have my shield of faith and my whole arm of God and you know what I'm saying amen then I I judge me amen that's right and I understand it was it was me right somebody mistreat you at the register hello and then you get all mad they're not the problem God tested the armor amen see what kind of armor you got on right and every one of us right we get those tests and we fail yes sir but don't look bad don't don't look bad on your it's like God is saying I'm getting your attention you allow the enemy to come in if what if that was a knife what if that was a sword that's right right you just you allowed him to penetrate the armor or the place where the armor should be you allowed him to penetrate you are now wounded because of your neglect amen it's not God it's our NE neglect amen stand therefore having your Lawns G about with truth that is so important because that's really your weakest part and your weakest part must maintain truth what is truth I am bride amen I've been created in His image amen I'm not a I'm not a devil I'm the seed of of God you got to have that truth that strong truth because I'm going to tell you something anybody any real Christian know when Satan causes you to stumble and fall the first thing he says to you see you ain't all you said yeah and remember when you when you was the the preacher was preaching you were like amen amen see where's your amen now see that's the way he comes at you but it's all because we fail to pray and die to ourselves daily amen that's right got to keep a song in your heart or a scripture in your mind or somewhere you got to entertain is that the word amen he told Israel he said put it on your head put it here put it around here put it on your you know everywhere you can put the word of God put it so when you look you'll be reminded of who you are amen and then the Bible says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus and you know what Jesus said said I do nothing except the father show me right so we got to understand it takes a real crucifixion a real dying out to ourselves uh and because we're being perfected and every every area measure of your of your life the inner man is going to be tried to see how much you have matured that's right from the last time amen this is about maturing amen that's right maturing and maturing mean I'm not going to lean to my not I'm Le script says lean not to your own understanding amen but acknowledge Him Amen in all of his ways what is his ways his word amen acknowledge Him in his word and he shall direct your path thank you Lord but when we get to a place and we allow the the the the the help how could say we when we allow and we don't have the helmet of faith on uh and then we allow doubt to come in doubt comes through the Mind from the mind it gets to the heart and from the heart it acts its way out amen and then we become a wounded soldier that's right or a fallen soldier only because we fail to put on the whole arm of God yes stand therefore having your Lawns gir about with truth and having on what the breastplate of righteousness what is righteousness believing God Amen Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him as righteousness amen and I don't mean just believing God in your head I mean believing God in your heart amen right your whole being you believe God remember the story brother bam talked about I think it was a young man who was very very ill and um he has Paul said gone down to such a low place and brother Brandon pray for the person and the parents got to shout praise God I thank God for healing my and the nurse says hold up hold up how can y'all act like that that's right how can you act like that this is scientific known that once the hardbeat get that low and the blood pressure goes that low there's no Revival the person usually die and and the old man says come come here honey come here come come say I know you mean well but see you looking at your your instruments amen but we're looking at the promise of God see that's how Faith reacts amen it it it Shields unbelief it it blocks it it stops it right the shield of faith and and the breastplate of righteousness the righteousness of of a Believer is to always believe God Amen always believe him right stand therefore having your girdled you know what that mean tighten up tight tight not loose but tighten up amen that's right it's literally uh making the rest of the body you know strong right it's like rolling the shoulders back pulling the stomach in y'all know what I'm saying it's what it does it gives strength to the to the weaker part always believe God and your feet shy with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen yeah you know so we we must understand the grace of God any questions while I'm going this way comments I got a question yes sir when you talk god a lot of people in the Lord when I hear I think and he said yeah you can't you can't believe and not live it yeah believing believe believe God is an action word it's it's uh yeah it's like um when you believe God like brother said hearing and acting upon the word because you have heard it you act upon that's what real belief is when you act upon what you've heard and so uh I I'll say it like this I don't know about where people going to go but I know it's a it's where we are now is is the the Jesus Christ of today has has furthered his Revelation amen of himself that's right and those people who are back here will not find him the same yesterday today and forever amen but those who have seen him and understood what is the furthering of it that's what putting on the this is what I'm saying having that whole arm of God also involves having a great a a a greater revelation of God Amen how how you going to have a a armor the whole armor your armor is based upon your Revelation see when you have a full revelation of who he is then you can un you can put and and understand this because that Revelation also reflects back to you on who you are this is what God Adam said you are bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh somewhere she disbelieved have misbelieve something cuz she should have known the serpent had nothing to do with her amen Adam was her husband and she was a womb of Adam she was not it was not in order to produce the serpent seed amen yall understand me so it's not in order for the Bride of Jesus Christ if we understand who we are we must be sold out to him and to him only in this revelation in this Revelation see because this Revelation amen will give us the ability to produce His Kind amen and this is why people oh oh the Holy Ghost see this is why brother Brandon he couldn't just leave it to justification cuz you can't have a justification without the Holy Ghost you can't have sanctification without the Holy Ghost you can't have baptism of the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost amen right but it's got to go further amen the revelation of our day takes us into the person of Jesus Christ that's right after to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance all of that that is the person that is his nature that is his characteristics and we as a bride of Jesus Christ must in excuse me envelop it must be produced in US amen now how we going to do it because it's not given to you no it's a battle amen this is your promised land and you got to conquer all the inhabitants of the land amen that's how it works it has to be conquered and how is it conquered through Joshua the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ himself amen all right so yes did I answer your question y y okay so when we look at these things we must understand amen that the Gospel of Jesus Christ and how often do you find it how often do you see that even preached in churches gospel as we know it the foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is his death burial and Resurrection amen how often do we hear it preached you see there are people even in our own church who've never understood what Calvary was all about why it had to take Calvary why was it a virgin amen right it had to be a virgin why see they don't know those things and so therefore they don't understand their position anybody could come and sway them to something else because they don't have a foundation for themselves but when you know the gospel like brother brand said there's no greater message than that a man can preach outside of the Gospel I don't care how deep your Mysteries are if you don't bring forth Calvary and how men should be saved and all of that it's all in vain amen that's right you got to preach that must preach that Hallelujah and o all things take the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery and wicked dot uh uh sorry quench all the fiery dots of the wicked right that means when you when you're going throughout the day do don't you know dots are being sh shot at you amen by wicked men by wicked women y'all don't know that oh it's const conly you know you don't you won't see them with a gun or a b and air or whatever but people brother B said people can project their Spirits you ever felt you ever you ever seen that happen I have I mean you could even be standing somewhere and all of a sudden you feel like somebody's staring at me and you know it you turn they St what did they do they projected their Spirit they don't they don't realize oh I'm going to project my spirit no it's an automatic thing that we do right and the thing about it is it when people do like do things like that it's never good hardly ever good there always a evil lustful Spirit that's coming at you amen yeah when we think about this this war Warfare uhh it it's All Flesh and this is why when I say All Flesh it involves our flesh Satan works with this because it's Fallen it's hybrid and anything that's hybrid causes death amen and you got to understand by the grace of God that this we're walking around in a body called death amen who shall deliver me from this body of death amen that's what Paul said that's right there's no real life in it uhuh the only life that we have is Christ himself and that's a a miraculous thing in in in itself that God could dwell in something that's dead amen cuz this body doesn't live it's dying daily amen right above all things the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God how you going to make it without the word people don't read they don't study how you going to make it you're supposed to be reading the Bible every day and praying amen every day one way or another right if it's by tape that's fine if it's you know by letting U the the the you know how they have it on the on the radio or the the thing where it reads the scripture to you however you need to be fed amen every day however you get it it's fine with God he don't mind he's just telling you you need to do it give us this day our daily bread and it must be done here's where I'm going to the 18th verse cuz I know I'm I'm behind but the 18th verse forgive me for rushing a little bit here praying always with with the with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for yourself no for all All Saints amen and sometime we go to prayer we just pray about us that's right that ain't what he saidy Lord he said perseverance and supplication for what All Saints amen we should pray for the house of God right not just being self as Lord deliver we ask it's okay to pray for yourself but remember there's others that need prayer amen and I I I I'll be honest with you I sometimes I've stayed as long as on my knees as as as as as uh I don't know I guess maybe an hour I'm not bragging but I like to feel him I don't like to get up without it amen that's right and I like I'll stay there till he comes and when he comes I'm satisfied y'all know what I'm saying and and I think that a lot of times I I go through in my mind or my prayer on my knees sometimes and and whether I fall asleep or not I don't know but I know I stay there till he comes amen and then when he comes that's when me and we we have a real conversation amen right so I just know that it prayer is a is a dimensional a dimensional thing you've got to die to yourself on your knees cuz you don't want to be there in the first place the devil don't want you on your knees yeah he he you know you don't mind praying here you know sitting in a chair but when it comes down to your knees he don't want you there the devil don't want you there because now you really humbling yourself before God in your natural and your natural is is reflecting what's in your heart right I I'm not saying that you have God say pray without ceasing wherever you have a place to pray you need to pray but let us not just have it Paul is trying to tell us in Ephesians don't just be praying for yourself all the churches have needs amen and whatever the Holy Ghost bring to your mind to pray for whoever he brings and if you don't have something get you a list amen that's right name everybody if you want to you don't know what they need you say God you know what they need that's but call their names out before the Lord just you know well I prayed and I I I ran out there's no such thing as running out of time um things to pray for there's a million things to pray for amen you just have your choice but there are many things to pray for E even in this assemly you love the Lord putting on the whole arm of God that means when the arm of God is on y'all know the old armor the the that they wore you can't even see the nothing but you know you got the helmet on you got everything you know those Knights of armor you can't even see who's behind it all you can see is the War equipment amen hallelujah and that's what God wants us to be in that way to have on the War equipment that when Satan see us he doesn't see us he see the equipment we and the devil will respect that amen yes brother Rich yes seems like the the armor is important if you don't have train along it arm yes all of that you've been telling us about isn't that yes yes because you know this is kind of like those are not gifts no sir and and it's kind of like boot camp yes sir they put you into the situation so that you can handle that situation when you get there that's right and patience if if I need patience he's going to put me in place where whoa it's going to be hard yes some place where I have to have patience yes and that exercises that yes sir Faith muscle yes brother it's not a gift you have to go through God's boot camp to get all of those attributes so that you can graduate somay amen that's the truth did y'all everybody did everybody hear what he said and it's so true understand that the training actually comes by God he is the of Joshua amen he is the he's the captain of the Lord's host and so therefore he trains us and like I was saying when he when he brings you to a place and you let's say for example um virtue and you slip in that area you know what I'm that's and uh or or faith put it that way that means you can't go you can't go all the way up to Temperance yet amen every place in you must be sealed amen and that comes through training right is that right amen going with with Brother Rich said after Boot Camp or before when you train don't you have to go through a final test that and that final test you got to you got to score amen that's right yeah you you you're not going they're not going to just pass you and you're not with all that training and you haven't learned what you've been taught you don't you don't graduate amen you''ve got to gradu you graduate after that final test that you can swim whatever that may be or or hold your breath whatever the case may be you got to pass those exams at the end before they graduate you every last one of them and that's how it is with God he's training us now but you know what a lot of time people don't real because because we're not conscious of the training we look at everything as just being the devil right but you got to understand it's God putting you in those positions to train right so that you can be sealed in faith okay sealed in virt sealed knowledge what is knowledge he that cometh to God first must believe that he is God Amen and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him not knowledge is to know that in the beginning was the word the word with God and the word is God Amen knowledge is not knowing all of the Bible knowledge is knowing the person of the Bible amen and we know we must understand that his word never fails amen it never fails I don't care what we go through it never fails right amen and so when we understand that that gives us Temperance wow I'm going to wait till my change come I love that job made a powerful statement though he slay me I'll trust him that's Temperance I'm going to wait to what my change clown y'all understand me that means I'm not going to be in haste I'm not going to rush I'm going to let God do his that's what and James says let Faith have her perfect work work you want Faith to have his perfect work you want it to be perfectly and entire not one little inch left I want it full so when I'm done I'm done amen yeah get me excited but that but I love that what Brother Rich implemented that was that was really good that was that was something that was really needed to to be said because the training comes from God right I I give you a sword and you don't know what to do with the sword what what good is a sword in your hand amen you must be trained and that's what God Said you know when when the Bible you got the Bible the Bible ain't here just for you to memorize and and know it's there exercise it you ought to be exercised in the scripture knowing when to speak when not to speak when to use the word when not to use the word that's all that's it a wise man knows it's not it's not good to to to to speak quickly amen the Bible say be a slow be slow fast quick to hear but slow to speak you love the Lord amen amen just give me a few more minutes here okay Paul says it here here says in the 19th verse and for me that utterance may be given to unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds oh I love that I love that I love the word bonds I mean not just you know he's an ambassador but he's in such he's he's going to be so faithful he's and it's a willful Bond it's not like God done put some ropes around him but he's in bondage to to God uh and faithful to God as an ambassador I'm going to say it even if it ca my life that's basically what he's saying I'm going to tell you the truth even if it if it and that's a true Christian that is a real Christian that's going to give you the word even if mean you won't be my friend I'm you know I might lose you whatever the case may be they going to stand right on that word I'm I'm an ambassador I'm a b in bonds that there where therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak you don't cow down you tell them the truth it's a sword not a feather amen right but that ye Also may know excuse me my Affairs and how I do tius a beloved Brethren and faithful minister in the Lord shall make known to you all things whom I have sent unto you uh for the same purpose that that you might know our Affair so he said I'm sending a messenger with a message and he's going to make known to you all of the things that I need to say all right let me read this one quote I I've got a few that I didn't get to but uh exposition of of of the seven Church agents uh brother Venom is saying uh thirdly he said he had the evidence of the fruit of god-given [Music] ministry 2 Corinthians 12:11 says I am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for I ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest Apostle though I be nothing then he goes in the First Corinthians 9:2 he says if I be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless I am unto you for the Seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord second Corin Ians 11:2 says for I am jealous over you with Godly jealous for I am exposing you to one husband that I may present to you as a Chase virgin unto Christ see Paul had been the means of bringing in multitudes of the Gentile sheep for he fed them and cared for them until they brought forth righteous fruits and were prepared to meet the Lord as part of a gentile bride so he was in bond he he he understood his men Ministry and he he literally gave all that he he could give out because his his purpose he wasn't trying to be a great bishop or an apostle he was working in God's program to literally try to get the church into a position where they would be spotless Amen in other words h a Chase bride unto the Lord I want to present and see that's what people don't understand preachers whatever the ministry is in the church they cannot spare the rod amen the rod comes to correct us amen the rod comes to deliver us it is the word of God it comes to clean us we're Washed by the Water of the word and and often time preachers are misunderstood because most people don't want them to meddle in their business but I don't mean no harm God is a meddler amen he going to meddle in your business that's what he does because he's Lov you he concerned about you right listen what brother R said he says our heavenly father we are certainly elated tonight to be assembled here with the groups of people this side of Eternity and have this fine fellowship and as we sat around these tables tonight looking across at each other and the business colleagues the Christians we are aware that there is a coming another time that we'll meet and and I loved it the way he said it because he said now we're meeting here in in this Dimension but this is not the end of it we're going to meet somewhere else amen there's a coming place that the saints of God is going to meet and and I go back to family when you can when you can put on the whole arm of God then you can actually see everybody as being your family amen that's the way it works you're not my other brother or my other sister yeah I don't like that but that's what people do yeah they they even give the natural family more privilege than a a love more than the spiritual amen something's wrong with that one y'all can say I'm wrong but I'm not I know I'm not wrong but we do it and the reason why we do it because we haven't been fully baptized with the Holy Ghost like we should because the children of Israel I mean excuse me on the day of Pentecost everybody else had family Ames but they became a real family when they got the Holy Ghost and they stuck together the Bible don't give all the details but there were many people who left their loved ones to follow the message of Peter and those who all followed the word they were family oh see how quiet y are but that's the truth that's true I'm just going by what Jesus said who is my mother who is my father who is my sister my my brother but those who follow what the the word of God my father do the father's will that's the real family because whether you believe it or not you wait till the squeeze come you going to find out who your real family is that's the way it works Hallelujah and the Christians we are aware that there is coming another time that we'll meet we trust that we'll we we'll all be there there everybody present at the great wedding supper in the air when the king will come out and wipe all tears from our eyes and say it's well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world and I'm I'm just working on a message called preparation of being prepared and and you know we look at these things and we we we don't understand that even even now the setting that we have here God knew exactly who was going to come to church God knows exactly who's receiving the word God knows exactly amen this was prepared that's that's way you know there's no coincidence with God Amen everything is prepared amen now here's this and we and I'm I'm I'm I know I'm I'm don't want to start but anyway coming from the reproach of the call uh the reproach for the the cause of the word paragraph 54 he said we had no way of bringing ourselves here or we do not know how we shall go out the Lord you give to us life and you have we we give our lives back to you amen and in so you have given us in exchange eternal life our faith breathes that into our very being and we love the for this because we know that someday we'll see you and you'll be in your glory and we'll look upon him and we'll we and we long to hear those words it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world until that time oh God when we all meet lead us so you got to understand that it is God who's leading us and he's leading to Leading us to a aare a place that has been prepared is that the word amen he told Moses he said I'm going to take you to a land flowing with milk and honey amen the land had already been prepared amen it was set up for the children of Israel they just had to get there amen hallelujah and everybody that followed Moses got there and everybody that followed Joshua properly got their Mountain amen see but those places were already already uh prepared amen Caleb's Mountain Joshua's Mountain they were there but we have to get there the city is already ready for ready for us amen but we got to get there and how we going to get there we got to kill the the habitants of the land we got to possess this land so much so to the devil don't know what to do with you amen may God help us all we all in battle amen you pray for me I'll pray for you right okay this is one it won't be long all right this is coming from a court trial paragraph 110 all right it went on for a while but on they talk about May 17th one morning it rained and is absolutely destroyed all those people that was put to a test against the word of God and saved those who belied God and made preparation for it amen see those who who rejected God the flood destroyed those who prepared themselves God saved amen and how did they prepare themselves by going into the Ark by listening to the word amen that's simple as it as it as can be my last quote amen uh so so so we understand when we when this is coming from The Sixth Seal uh paragraph 390 um we we must understand that when we got baptized we we we forget when we got baptized we oh Lord you you saved me I'm going to do all you want me to do I'm going to be faithful Lord you know I'm going to walk in your ways I'm going to y'all know the promises I don't remember your prayer but I can remember what I prayed somewhat you know what I mean I mean I was so out to God right but down the road because I fail and I'm saying it to you too when you fail to deny yourself and to when you fail to Die daily you literally losing your Revival amen you are going to grow cold that's right that's just it you got to pray that's what people don't you know pray is the prayer brings the fire you know it's nothing you you you at the altar and you got the wood you got the you got the the sacrifice but where's the fire prayer brings the fire and that that's that's all I can say but here it says and uh 390 uh it says now father I pray that all that will receive you at this time in their hearts will settle for it forever at this hour that they are finished with sin sin is unbelief that they will rise and make preparations now talk about the public confession a baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins to show that they believe that God has forgiven them and they take on the name of Jesus Christ we forget it but Paul said put on the whole arm of God remember your name if we could remember that our name is his name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's who we are the whole family of of Heaven and Earth is named after him and if we can't whatever we can't we can't do it in the name of Jesus it shouldn't be done amen that's the way it works put on the whole arm of God let your faith take you on to higher Heights every one of us are going through battles right now and if you're not going through battles you need to check check check check something out something ain't right and I don't mean these little water down battles I'm talking about intense amen battles you know what I mean and I don't know about you all but I am I'm going through some great battles it's okay I'm to be honest with you I see God changing me and I see God getting my attention more often now when I go wrong he he makes me see where I'm wrong and you know the the thing about it even and and I said it like this by the grace of God if you can't see the coming of the Lord now I don't know what to say amen I I really don't everything is falling apart not just America everywhere demonic powers are joining together and and and we don't even see it but so that you'll know and now whether this this news article is true I I received it and uh we know that this present I when they get they going to have this Vatican thing soon um uh the united united churches um the church World Council church is getting ready to have this big thing United Nation is what I mean and our country is getting ready to sign us off to Who and the United Nation when that happens all of the American rights are finished there's no such thing as a constitution then yes part of that part of what they enacted this week at the United Nations after what you just said was that every country has to have every citizen so when you when you realize uh uh what's happening now what has been kept from us by what I understand uh we say well how these illegal aliens coming in but they're not what what what's been hidden from a lot of us is that they've been given citizenship this is why they have and getting what they getting we we're getting the last end of everything so what so you understand this is not just happening in America it's happening everywhere and whatever country that will not bow they put him in war to kill them off amen so you understand what we're working with now I'm saying this and I said all of that not because I love my country and uh I know I'm from Heaven brother vandom said when it comes to America she says you gotta you gotta you got to stand with her in her glory and stand with her in her shame so it doesn't mean that I'm going to do what she's doing I I hate to see where she's going come but we know the prophecy we we know it people right but the the like I said the greatest thing now we must deal with this man on the inside right somebody we know oh well I got to get married before the Rapture that'll be fine too you you SE your corn your wheat your whatever it's fine but what we fail to see it's the bigger picture cuz even over there you won't have husband and wives everything going to be brothers and sisters Hallelujah just like it was in the beginning amen so I I want y'all to understand don't think God cheating you out of nothing cuz I can't hardly wait to get to heaven I can't hardly wait till my change come y'all can I guess I'm old man now but I can't I've been feeling this way for a mighty long time so but I but I don't want to go with out meeting the measure that God wants me to meet I want to hear well done and so I just want to encourage y'all tonight if the Lord would Grant you Grace to say Lord increase my prayer life increase my my my meditation whatever I need to do to to to to bring up myself up to the Statue of a perfect man to the divine nature is in full control so let it be Lord let's stand as we say thank you for your patience putting on that whole arm of God is actually taking the word of God and covering yourself with it so much so that you can't be seen only God can be seen and as we know God has Us in this training right now and you got to understand by the grace of God that he's looking for us to be Victorious and not forever failing and I love that that's saying take up your bed and walk am gain the strength to to move obstacles obstacles like that brother say if it ain't there put it there so we thank God for the grace of God and thank you for all being here I appreciate our brother Rich for that really uh I can't it's like he flipped a page for me so I appreciate that because that is the truth God we must be trained in order to be able to use it correctly father father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for this little bible study that we had tonight dealing with the whole arm of God oh there's so many things that could be said but father by your grace we believe that enough has been said that we must that we can so that we can see

that we can love love our enemies and love our friends love our brothers love our sisters that we can be real family Lord you said that the world will know that we are your disciples by the love that
