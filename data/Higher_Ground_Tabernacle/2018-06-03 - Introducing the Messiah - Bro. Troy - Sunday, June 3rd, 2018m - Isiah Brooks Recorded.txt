definitely feel this morning that this service has been orchestrated by the Living God amen every song every moment every every prayer it's been made I I can tell it's just going in hand-in-hand with the message so that means we're in a good spot sings a man it means that we have the Most High God is concerned with our making sure we know where we're at amen he's taken an active partner service a man that he has kept every appointment Amen I just want to thank the Lord for just making himself known this morning then and we appreciate it Saints amen amen what would we be without him Amen so let's just turn in our Bibles as we stand John chapter 1 verse 6 speak a message called the introduction of the Messiah amen Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago was one of the greatest events in all history amen st. John chapter 1 verse 6 it says there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God is that isn't that precious Saints amen how many as received him tonight amen amen so as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on is which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have we all received and grace for grace a male Issus power has in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for this metaphor this morning father for showing up in the room Lord for for being here with us Lord we're we're relying Lord on your presence we're relying Lord on your atonement father for your mercy and your grace towards us Pilate and we just pray Lord do you take the three minutes this morning Lauren take the highest place may your spirit Lord settle down over the audience father and touch every heart Lord in a way that I cannot do by myself father Lord that you would bless the words that come out of my mouth father they not be my words Lord but your words for we have opened up your Holy Word father and Lord we seek to to know it Lord perfectly and we just thank your father for allowing us to be in this place in your presence and we thank you Lord for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen you know John the Baptist had quite a position Amen the Messiah was coming amen and he he had a he had a job that that the that the path needed to be made straight for the Messiah to come amen for this was one of the greatest right I say the greatest moment in all of history that God was going to come down and be amongst his creation amen the God that created the heavens and the earth was going to was going to leave glory and come down to live amongst men to eat with men to to sleep with men to to to to fellowship one with the other to break the bread with a life with them amen to preach the gospel to heal the sick to reveal his power to them amen and such an appearance by the Almighty God by the Almighty Creator demanded that there must be an introduction made amen so that's why when to preach this morning was the eighth reduction of the Messiah amen who received him someone had to receive him first to reveal him unto others amen so God hand-picked a man called John the Baptist amen and he and he revealed to him that Christ is coming soon amen the Messiah that we have all waited for is on his way he might be amongst us right now John said amen he's I don't know where he is right now but he says he's right here amongst us right now he's he's somewhere around us somewhere around us is some of this walking that is actually not flesh and just flesh and bone but is the Almighty God that created the heavens and the earth and he said but I do know that when I see him I will wit bear witness of him amen because the Lord told me when you see the Spirit of God descending like a dove that is the one I am talking about amen so as John the Baptist was preaching and preaching and he and he went out to the river Jordan and he looked at all those scribes and Pharisees and he said you called gonna come back and make us I know you say that your father's cross this river Jordan I know you say a cross on dry ground but you guys need to leave Jerusalem amen leave your denomination leave all your foolishness behind come back here and cross Jordan all over again a man and come back to where you came from and come be baptized in the Jordan repenting of your sins because the Messiah is coming amen and so the soil really is calling and men would come out just to watch a man they leave Jerusalem to go out there's just a scene just to watch and he call him out you snakes in the grass why did you come out here to see why did you come out here for you know and he and he said because they didn't come out there to repent they didn't come out there to be made clean they came out there just a view and to see what was going on amen so in so in Jesus Christ came up to be baptized and he realize this is the one my entire ministry is up to this moment anyway he begins to realize you know I Lord I you know you should be baptizing me not me baptizing you but Jesus home suffered to be so amen the sacrifice had to be washed because because because John the Baptist's you know at first he thought he be introducing the Lion of the tribe of Judah but then he he caught the revelation for the Lord that I am introducing the lamb amen because remember he growing up as a child he heard the promises and he heard all the things about how God was going to raise up a king to sit on David's throne and all that and be the Lion of the tribe of Judah but God had to take him out in the desert and remove all that thinking away from him amen and say no you are not going to be introducing the Lion of the tribe of Judah you're going to be introducing the sacrifice you are going to introduce the atonement the atonement the Lamb of God that will be slain for the sins of his people a man be because before they can receive their king they first had to receive their atonement Amen because all those sacrifices from age after age after age of all the blood of bulls and goats could not remove the sins that they have committed a man so before they could ever receive their king they first all sudden John caught the revelation of it that's the king is at first the atonement is first and God is sending the lamb a lamb which was Christ himself God himself he says when the Lamb of God shows up when the lamb gosh shows up I will identify him amen amen and then when he saw he said though I see this the the the dove coming down the Holy Spirit coming down and just singing like enough that is the lamb that will be take away the sins of the world amen and he introduced the Messiah amen the Messiah was introduced and he was introduced what as a lamb a man to take away their sins and as many as it would receive him receive their head their sins were taken away a man as many as received that atonement their sins were taking away as far as the East is from the West their sins were taken away if they received him amen and not only that but when the Messiah was introduced and when that once their eyes were pointed towards the Messiah then the Messiah start going out and do miracles and miracles and miracles start showing his power and John became less and the Messiah became greater amen and you began to see the power of this lamb and the power that was behind this meek man amen and what does he do when he died those were little tokens of his resurrection amen little tokens of his resurrection that he hadn't even accomplished yet but little tokens of his resurrection being shown out that he was had all the power and heaven earth as Jesus said himself said behold all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me a man what'd he do he gave that unto the church a man the greatest event the greatest story in all time of all history a man John the Baptist said and of his fullness have we all received and grace for grace amen have you received his fulness hey man are you sure you've received his fullness a man have you received everything that Christ died for amen everything that Christ paid the price for maybe he paid the price that we could go back and be sinless they meant that we could be redeemed from the things that we've done I mean he paid the price for the sickness of our body amen he paid the price for for all the foolish things that we've done in the Reez that we committed that all that can be swept away and we could be standing before him amen amen we receive him amen and from glory to glory and of his fullness have all we received and grace for grace amen and for the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ that's what the man introduced himself I was over to the Book of Amos chapter 3 familiar Scripture brother branham mentioned the scripture frequently Amos threes and sixth verse it says shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid share that shall there be evil in a city and the LORD hath not done it surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets Amen he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets a man so if the Lord is going to do something amen he's going to reveal it to his prophets and his prophets are going to go out and make the introduction to what the Lord is presently doing amen so whenever you're in an age where God is getting ready to do something and there is going to be a prophet there to tell you what the Lord is getting ready to do a man so that the so the people that are called by the Most High God can turn that corner and keep following that pillar a fiery man just like the children of Israel followed the pillar of fire in the in the wilderness and everywhere that pillar fire went they went and they followed it and followed and followed it amen and so God still has pillars of fire amen he still has prophets to lead the way a man so that when the pillar of fire changes direction and goes this way that the the people that are called by his name amen they're sincere and love the Lord to have something down on the inside that God can work with amen that they will see that they'll catch it that little seed will spring to life I will say that is truth that is real I'm going to follow that he meant because they realized that God is speaking to him and God is revealing to him what actions he is getting ready to take place amen because there has to always every time that God always has to be an introduction to a guy is going to do amen because everything that God has done he's actually has done it by Jesus Christ meant as much as we can talk about oh the prophet Isaiah was a great prophet you know and Jeremiah was a great prophet and all these were great prophets they were being led by the Lord Jesus Christ they're being led by the Holy Ghost amen men moved of old by the Holy Ghost wrote the scriptures so as they everything that they said when they came out of their mouth that they were speaking prophecies of the Holy Ghost amen and what is the Holy Ghost it's God amen it's God it's the one that created that being that created the heavens in the world amen amen and so that that spirit that Holy Spirit brings an introduction and constantly reveals unto his children what he is doing in the age when he is doing it amen and so there has to be an introduction it's the introduction of what the Messiah is who he is and what he is doing in the age that he is doing a man's like Enoch couldn't take Noah's message amen Noah couldn't take Enochs message amen each had their own message amen amen amen so John the Baptist had a message he says I am here to make straight the path for the Lord amen so that when he comes he can go straight about and do his work that he is here to do and did it work then it worked amen then even the disciples they had all heard of John they knew his ministry they knew what he was doing but they took the Lord to say so that was what you read back in the book prophets that is this is what it was doing is exactly what John said he was doing amen he was introducing the Messiah a man so John made the path straight for the Lord then Jesus came down and touched the heart of men amen the heart that he had placed something down in there on the inside to receive him before the foundation of the world and he came down to receive that touch that and what to do is start growing something on the inside amen I trust we've all had the same experience amen hey man why did they why do they need an introduction because they are affecting a key amen there they were focused the wrong direction amen they needed an atonement they are looking for deliverance from the Romans but the thing they needed deliverance from most was their heart of sin amen and they were facing the wrong direction and so John the Baptist came down preaching repentance repentance repentance get your heart right get your heart right get your heart right why is he doing he was making straight the path the Lord he was making the high places and bringing them down low taking the low places and bringing them up amen what was he doing making a straight path it wasn't it wasn't just whoa well he's going to build some roads out there or whatever they thought of back he first I was first prophesy but no he literally made the hearts right so they could receive their Messiah amen amen why so the Messiah was gonna be introduced and the plan before the Messiah was to be introduced as the hearts have to be prepared why so they can receive their Messiah amen the introduction of the Messiah came two hearts that were already prepared amen and I was a Jose it was an atmosphere over the whole country amen amen an atmosphere was being created year in the years preceding the introduction of Christ an atmosphere being created an atmosphere of repentance people are going out there John bastards bow knees cry now repent repent repent the kingdom of heaven is coming repent the kingdom of heaven is coming and the kingdom of heaven came in the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I do it got there they got it identified him not just as the Lion of the tribe of Judah but as the Lamb that would take away their sins amen amen hey man it's just like John the Revelator had the same experience when he was you know I said come up hither you know and behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he he turns around and he looks and there was a lamb as though it been slain a man he had the same experience amen that's the lamb introduction amen so in so when Jesus Christ was revealed as he began to show forth the fruits of his resurrection and show forth his power as being God Almighty as the sick began to be healed the dead began to be raised and the power of the Spirit that was with him too to speak to the wind to calm the storms and to create bread to do all these things into man you feed the 5,000 all things that were done he was showing forth the power that was down on the inside making full evidence that there was a that was a real power and what he do that same spirit amen and when he said my God my God you know why is not forsaking me and he said I commit my hand my spirit into your hands and then what the Holy Spirit as the Holy Spirit leaves him they meant as the Holy Spirit leads where the horse Peter Duke comes back down later the same pillar of fire splits itself up on the day of Pentecost amen and comes down Acts chapter 2 and that same pillar fires now as tongues of flame sit upon those that have been filled with the Holy Ghost amen and that experience still happens today amen tongues of fire still rest upon those that are filled with the Holy Ghost it's the same color fire that led the children of Israel in the wilderness now leads sons and daughters of God as they receive power to have the children of God amen and they received the Holy Ghost amen the same pillar of fire a man a known and and so many people with critics eyes brother Branham for talking about the pillar of fire and saying oh well you know you just imagine that or you just think that you saw that you know but but why should a true Christian doubt that because we know that it's there amen we're still living in Bible days amen oh I have not seen the pillar of fire with my natural eyes I haven't seen it but I have felt this presence I have felt his presence I know that he's there's been times where like I said when I've been driving down the interstate and I look around at the cars around me I wonder can they tell what's going on in this car I mean it's like dude do they see do they know what is going on on the inside of this vehicle as as God comes into the vehicle and the atmosphere changes you know and you you know that your God is he's making his presence known amen it is that same pillar of fire amen amen it's like a ram said do you feel that sweet presence standing between me and you it's a there on the purlins he says that's that same angels that same pillar of fire amen or out over the audience he said did you feel that sweet presence that came over that pillar of fire standing right above you amen why because this is that same presence that's leading the children of Israel now as leading his bride amen he's been introduced Amen he's been identified a man we know and we have to know him amen amen so the and so the holy spirit was made manifest there on the during the feast of Pentecost amen during the feast of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down and may revealed himself in the upper room a man who made himself known made himself known to the people made himself known that the power of the Resurrection was now given to them the power of the resurrection of the Messiah and all the power that was inside Christ when he died upon the cross that power was released to be distributed upon those that receive Christ in his name amen and when they gathered together in you know in the upper room and they were gather go and they're worshiping they're praying they were seeking his face and as they gathered up there there all sudden that the same power that was in Christ was suddenly released to the church amen and the power it came down into the room like the sound of a machine right Erwin and they were filled with the same power amen amen that's what our God does a man it was during the Feast of the pentecost that's when the that's when the wave sheaf was waved that's when the firstfruits of the the harvest our are shown out and there and as they're waved over the people amen and and during those fifty days of of harvesting there from there to the feast of atonement there's seven Sabbath's there between the feast of Pentecost to the feasts of the atonement seven Sabbath's amen and what and what is is the the firstfruits or who were revealed there on the day of Pentecost amen that the see that went down into the ground multiplied itself up or came up and was and was persecuted on the cross a man he was smitten rejected of men a men and then that first fruits were waved over the people over Pentecost and then what the same power was given unto them amen so at the same power that was in Christ now is upon the church amen and throughout these seven churches we have seen the same power revealed over and over and over again amen and what now after after this is coming from brother Bram's message the feast of the trumpets and after after you come to the the end of those seven church ages the seven Sabbath's you come to the feast of atonement amen as the Jews have been called as the trumpets had been mirror we've been called by our seals we've been called by our church age messengers amen and was we have been called out now the Jews are also going through their call Amen it hasn't necessarily been fully revealed to us because we haven't received their Elijah right but we can see glimpses of what they're going through because we can see that something has been happening to the Jews for the last hundred years something is going on a man they're being called by their trumpets a man because the trumpets call the gathering of Israel amen so even though we may not fully understand it we know it's happening a man one of these days there will be two witnesses that will show up in Jerusalem and they will reveal just like it was revealed to us was it was revealed to us in the seventh Church eh what all the previous ages were all about amen and our enter and the blindness was taken off us and we saw where we stood the same thing is going to happen to the Jews between the sixth to the seventh trumpet event a man as two witnesses come down and they begin to reveal it's Moses and Elijah and they're showing forth and revealing they're looking for their king but they have to receive their atonement first amen they're looking for someone to come back and rebuild the temple amen a step type of worship again but first they have to receive the atonement and they cannot get their eyes off of the temple to receive the atonement until the Prophet comes amen and that's what they are waiting for let's turn over in our Bibles to Luke chapter 9 speaking about the two witnesses what were they witnesses up the book of Revelation said at chapter 11 says that there will be two witnesses sent if you're a witness you had you can know you cannot be well I so-and-so told me that so-and-so told me that this happened amen in order to be a witness she had to be saying I saw it and I know what it's all about and I am going to expound to you what I saw and heard and give you the testimony game it so Luke chapter 9 28th verse it says and it came to pass about eight days after these sayings that he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray amen now eight days now fifty days is seven Sabbath's plus one amen and that's where we're from the feast of Pentecost - the feast of atonement seven Sabbath's for us and then the fiftieth day will be in the eighth seventh amen and it came past about eight days after these sayings he took Peter John and James and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering what was happening he's being transfigured I meant he's being the glory of his position of who he is amen nope not not no longer just the lamb but the the what he is what what why is Christ dying on the cross what's he doing this so that he can take us with with him to go and reign as king amen he's being glorify he's being transfigured amen and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering and behold there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elijah who appeared in glory and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem they came to talk to him now remember Jesus hasn't been crucified yet but the Moses Elijah come down before the crucifixion meet with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is our I picked up three witnesses so the thing would be sure so they could see this amen and it is sit there and when they taught us our talking this Moses Elijah I just we just came down we just want to kind of talk to you about these things we know that we have to bear witness of this later in the future amen and we want to know about your death that you're getting ready to have on Calvary about how you're going to be the lamb slain but all the Lambs that we saw how I remember when you you had me write down all on them tablet I remember when you had me right there or write down all these things all these and everything and I'll write all this down that you gave me amen and now I get to see what it was all about amen I get to see it was all about you you're getting ready to be slain for the sins of the people amen and they became witnesses of his majesty they became witnesses of his glory but they also became witnesses of his death that he was going to accomplish on Calvary amen and one of those two witnesses in Revelation chapter 11 they come down and they testify for three and a half years talking about the trying to bring them back to the Feast of the atonement amen because they're sitting there they're waiting they've been called out of out of all of Europe and out of all the places of all the world they've been called by the trumpets that had called out called out come out of her my people amen come into this land that I have prepared for you and they've entered into it and now their hearts have to be changed because the blindness is still there I mean remember they were blinded for our sake amen and they were called while they're still blind amen because the their the blindness was not removed once they were called amen so they were called out of Nazi they were called out of Hitler they are called by all those things they were called to a train to Jerusalem to receive that what they thought they're gonna receive their King the mighty king but first they must receive the lamb their atonement amen and these two witnesses will reveal that atonement to them amen and so the meantime while the sixth trumpet is being revealed and while they're going through their sixth trumpet we're going through what are we doing we're trained we transition from the sixth seal or from the sixth church age to the seventh church age amen amen and we're as they're progressing so we progressing it all comes to a blending our Amen where the Holy Spirit is getting ready to transfer over to the Jews that take the blindness away from their eyes to seal away the work for the Gentiles amen amen because we have already received our life amen we already had the Messiah that was introduced to our fathers amen and we'll be introduced to the Jews as also in these last days been introduced use to us hey man now let's just I know I know most of us here know this but we're gonna go through the I have these four scriptures that when I go through a male s turn over to Isaiah chapter 61 isaiah 61:1 and to prof isaiah here speaking he says the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn amen here's Jesus Christ is being sent to do all these things but when Jesus Christ stood up in the Book of Luke and he opened up the scroll amen he opens up the scroll he gets set he stands up in the tabernacle or in the synagogue and he opens and he stands up with a synagogue he's gonna preach Jesus Christ is gonna preach to the people and a scroll is handed to him it's a scroll of the Book of Isaiah he opens up the scroll he's rolls up to the state to the point Isaiah chapter 61 here and he starts reading these same scriptures and he reads them and he says the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings of the meek to buy out the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and opened the prison to them in their bound and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and he stops at that comma right there Amen he stops right there Jesus Christ when he was reading this verse two thousand years ago stopped at that comma and midway through verse two a mint and Jesus stopped there because the next part says and the day of vengeance of our God it wasn't the day of vengeance two thousand years ago so Jesus stopped right where he was at and he rolls up the scroll and he says this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears this is the day at the scripture and he could not go any further because that scripture the rest of that verse too was not revealed in that day hey man so now brother branham gets up on this in our last day amen amen and he gets up on preaching the gospel there in Arizona amen and he and he gets up and he goes to read of Rita but read a verse and two of his pages were stuck together and he and he goes to read and he can't get to the page he wants to go to he doesn't realize they're stuck together amen and so what does he do and her priest stands up and a Catholic priest sands up he says here God we don't know eat rest easy now God is fixing to do something take my Bible and read from this and brother Bram took the priests Bible and open it up and read the verse a mint from Bishop Stanley's by that and then he said and then later that night the next night I think that night or the next day he started to be preached a message this day this scripture is revealed in your ears this is the day the hour the day of the vengeance of our God is coming amen amen we're now at the end of time that where Jesus had to pause at that comma there the pause is being removed the thing that stopped Jesus from going he further is being removed amen and a prophet came in our day to let us know we're turning the corner the day of the vengeance of our God is coming amen repent get your heart ready get your heart ready why because it was it the Messiah was being introduced again this time is being introduced to the Gentiles now when the when the Messiah was introduced to the Jews well they are they were expecting the mighty king to come and deliver them but they needed their hearts to be ready first they were expecting the king but they needed to receive the lamb the atonement a man so brother Branham came and he came to preached what what are we doing we're here to receive our atonement amen we have to receive our time we talk about the rapture we talk about the second coming to the Lord but he but Jesus but as John the Baptist's for one the first company to the Lord so is this man sent with the message therefore were on the second coming Lord and before we can receive these mighty revelations we first must receive the lamb the atonia amen because that's always the pattern every time that's the pattern you must receive the atonement before you receive the revelation and once you receive the atonement then you can go forth to the day of Pentecost then you can go and receive the power Amen know then you can Becan receive power to become sons of God amen after you've received the atonement but let me tell you Saints once you have received that told me oh my once you have received that then you have received the power to become sons of God and that power is the same pillar of fire and led the children of Israel now leads every true believer a man so you cannot do the things that you want to do amen because when you try to go this way also the hoist Bears let's no stop don't do that go over here and do this go no don't do that do this over here if you do something wrong he convicts you you're like oh I gotta make that right Oh Lord forgive me forgive me what's he doing it's the same pillar of fire is leading his bride he's leading us leading us he has not left us without a witness amen he is still here this he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen brother Branham preached that even clearer back in the 1930s brother Branham had an old Ford panel truck and he had written he had an artist paint all over the side of it geez Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen Clare back in the 1930s he was preaching Hebrews 13:8 he's the same he's the same amen and we are coming and we are here to be to be heirs of that scripture heirs of that scripture amen we inherited that scripture that's our food that's our bread I mean healing is the children's bread amen deliverance is the children's bread a and all these things that's for the children and we have received power to become the children of God amen why because we have received the atonement amen now we can go receive the power amen amen the trumpets were to call Israel amen and when we look and see that the trumpets are already sounding that's why they are where they are something called them something called them to Israel what was is the trumpets now we haven't had a prophet to reveal to us exactly what those trumpets were but that they will have prophets they will have Moses and Elijah they'll come and reveal to them and Moses is the same one that wrote what the trumpets were all about the first time in the Leviticus he'll come and reveal the meaning of it the second time amen amen and they will preach the three and a half years and make a full revelation of where the Jews stand amen 144,000 will receive it they meant mine where do we stand Saints day man so as soon as as soon as the temptation comes upon you and says well it's been 50 60 years now I can relax you know maybe maybe the message isn't all what it's supposed to have been or or maybe God has left us alone or or don't you don't you get that don't you let that slackness don't you let that lay it Laodicean laziness fall upon you amen amen because we realize that we are right on the on the border of the coming of the Lord amen we have received amen no I want to continue on we went to Isaiah and Luke where Jesus Christ stopped halfway now I want to go to the Elijah portion of those so let's go over to Malachi chapter 4 amen we were preaching this in down a village in Guyana to the chief of the village he had gathered a couple of the denominational pastors of village and I wanted to know what we were doing there and now these are the scriptures we used Isaiah and Luke and then this and and then back to Luke again amen verse Isaiah or a mouse or Malachi Malachi 4 verse 5 it says behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth of the curse now amen now the spirit Elijah came in John the Baptist amen he prepared the way before the Lord amen and what'd he do he turned the hearts of the he turned the hearts of the fathers of those old Pharisees and Sadducees of those fathers to the children that received amen he turned their hearts amen what'd he do he stopped right there right he stopped right there now I know to go now let's go over to John the Baptist there Luke's 117 says here in Luke John the Baptist fulfilled the first part of that verse just like Jesus fulfilled the first part of his verse Luke 1:16 talking about John the Baptist here and says and many of the children of Israel shall he turned to the Lord their God amen and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children but he doesn't turn the hearts of the children back to the father's because he only fulfills the first half of that verse amen so then what there has to be an Elijah's spirit come amen they will turn the hearts in this day of the children back to our Pentecostal fathers amen so those that receive the atonement amen on the end they received the atonement of Christ who died on Calvary and they went into an upper room and they received and they received the same pillar of fire coming down upon them like tongues of fire amen those are our fathers amen and a spirit of Elijah came down on a man by the name William Branham he came to turn our hearts back to that a ment where all the Pharisees had to get off their high horse and turn their hearts to the disciples say man to the children we have to turn our hearts back to the same disciples they men who received that Pentecost amen amen and what and so we are led by the same pillar of fire that's why that's why the pillar fire was so prevalent in brother brands means because we have to be turned back to where the pillar of fire first came he meant that asked the token the pillar fire came on the day of Pentecost split itself up an opponent and what's he trying to do what'd he do he would the pillar fire would go and settle over someone and they'd be healed he'd go over here and his salesperson they'd be healed and he'd go over was the split fire is identifying people that have a need of the resurrected Messiah the pillar fire was identifying people that had an need of the resurrected Messiah a man and didn't you're a rogue Graham said no high spirits sisse don't don't get up don't move around the stay reverent stay reverent what's he doing he's a killer fire he doesn't want if the pillar fires identifying himself or people to have a need of the resurrection he meant and we all have a need to experience the power of his resurrection to experience he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and we have to experience the same pillar of fire to reveal unto us that Jesus Christ is still alive amen amen the pillar fire is still here to do that amen was that the Messiah is being introduced to us the Messiah has been introduced to us amen we're here to reveal though the whole has been revealed unto us amen just like in the book of Esther when Vashti rejected the summons of her King amen the King has earth set up a feast I don't I didn't look it up right before I got up here but I believe it was a hundred and eighty days or 150 days somewhere in that 180 day feast to to testify of all the glory of his kingdom and as he and as he and it throughout this feast he is showing the glory of his kingdom and we gather together all the Lord's and all the captains and all the chief men and he gathered again and he started revealing the glory of his kingdom the glory of his kingdom the glory of his kingdom and I got to II the last couple days of the feast he saved the best for last and he wanted to reveal his bride at the very end of the feast a manis he went to go reveal his bride to to the gathering to the church he went to go reveal his bride to the captains that that the bride refused to come and she and what'd she do she had her own feast going on with her own maidens up in her own chambers and she counted her feast more glorious and better to be attended to than the Feast of King Hauser's so she refused to come when king azeris bid amen and so is a ban in the last day God has shown his the glory after a glory 7 church ages he's been revealing the power of his resurrection he comes here in the last day to reveal the bride of Lord Jesus Christ and he calls the church to step up to that high calling to step up to that high honor but instead they're sinners they're gathered together in their own cloisters they're gathered together in their own denominations and they're and they're receiving affirmation one of the other instead of receiving affirmation from Christ amen and they're receiving and they're talking about how great they are and how great he is a man so when he calls the bride to be revealed they begin to reveal vast she reveals that she's not worthy to even be the bride amen so here we are at the last days when at the end of the feast the end of the Pentecostal feast the fifty days amen and it's time for the bride to be revealed right before the feast of atonement for the Jews and what is it and and the church has risen up and shown that they would rather have their programs their denominations they'd rather have their own doctrines and dogmas so and they bound the Holy Spirit of God so he can't work can't lead and they bound the pillar of fire so he can't move amongst them a man so at that moment they count themselves not worthy they get removed from from their position of honor and he says go and seek out a woman that will that will receive me a man they will that will and wasn't an ester fit why because she could receive the leading of the Holy Ghost she received the leading of the Chamberlain amen amen so now the same thing those that in this day they received the leadership of the Chamberlain the leadership of the Holy Ghost they receive the same pillar of fire they're our hearts is turned back to the Pentecostal fathers they received the same pillar of fire they came down on the day of pentecost amen amen and then what do they do they are counted worthy why because they're not looking forward to their own word to their own Dogma Amen brother Brian said that the very riot the right at the time of the sixth and seventh trumpet when when God is getting ready to reveal himself to the Jews the church rejects the word and the bride receives the word and goes up to glory amen amen right there by where do we stand that Messiah has been introduced to us introduced that he is the atonement a man but he's not just the atonement but he's the same pillar of fire that led the children of Israel in the wilderness the same pillar of fire that that came down on the day of Pentecost the same pillar of fire that was in brother man's meetings is all the same over and over the Messiah is being introduced to us and while the church has rejected the word we received the word and go up into glory with him that's where we stand Messiah has been introduced soon as they as they receive the gay agenda amen as they receive perversion as the church begins to have to make choices of whether they will have women preach the gospel as they have to make choices of whether they'll have married gay marriages right amen as the law is going to start cracking down on these ministers and say you have to you have to marry a homosexual or you or or or or you can't preach the gospel because they rejected the word back in the 60s the denomination is now they can't go back to the word the stance so they're like a waving ship that goes they don't know where they go there and where they stand and and and now the and now the grandchildren of those that rejected the word have been set for failure how can they receive the word unless they hear a cry come out of her my people let's see we made partaker of her since Amen because you're living in Babylon a cage of every unclean and hateful bird a man ZZZ unclean birds are being revealed and all the cages of denominations amen does God need people that have come out of her amen and and and and receive the atonement and we've been washed away of all their sins a man in the clean cleansing of the Lamb that comes upon them a man then they could receive their Messiah because then the Messiah can be revealed to them amen amen amen let's just stand let's turn in our Bibles as we stand over to revelations chin 7 at the very time that the Jews are being called by their trumpet the bride receives the word she hears the voice of the seventh angel messenger of Laodicea the mystery of God is finished is finished she receives it and she goes up in a rapture into glory amen revelations 10 seven says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets as we read in Amos 3 the Lord will do nothing except he declares it first to his servants the prophets and the same thing happened again in our day for the seventh angel the Laodicean angel amen revealed the mysteries of God you know laid open the revealed the word to us again the word was open to us the seals were taken off the book and we see who he is we see that he is the same Amen in all the mysteries of marriage and divorce and and all these things are open to us amen so that we can follow lock in step with what God had intention from the beginning as Jesus said with marriage divorce you know but it wasn't so from the beginning well we had a prophet come and reveal that to us in this day amen amen that's why we that's why we stay with what the mess just on those tapes preach to us amen because that is what we were called to amen while the denomination rejects the word we received the revelation of the word to the seventh angel amen and our hearts are turned back to the Pentecostal father's amen amen let us bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your introduction Lord for revealing yourself to us Lord Lord we needed that father I needed it Lord Lord I was going astray father I tried to serve you in the
