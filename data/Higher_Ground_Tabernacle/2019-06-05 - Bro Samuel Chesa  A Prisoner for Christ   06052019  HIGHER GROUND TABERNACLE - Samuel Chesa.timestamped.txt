[20:17] be on a Wednesday night I want to thank
[20:20] the pastor for granting me this
[20:21] opportunity to be able to minister the
[20:24] word amen
[20:25] I believe we're all expecting to hear
[20:27] from the Lord Amen cuz we always get
[20:30] what are we expecting to get before we
[20:34] just open our Bibles she's opening a
[20:36] word of Prayer
[20:47] we thank you Lord for this time o God we
[20:51] thank you of God not one approach to you
[20:53] Lord Jesus Christ me when I hear from

[21:09] answer in order to our questions
[21:10] provider God to our needs Oh Lord and
[21:13] let us go out and saying truly the Lord
[21:15] was there and they spoke to me O God and

[21:32] hear o God let them be blessed thank you
[21:37] for everything and we give you and your
[21:39] honor in their praise in Jesus Christ's
[21:40] name we pray amen amen
[21:46] whilst we're still standing let's open
[21:48] our Bibles to the book of Philemon the
[21:52] first chapter and the first verse that's
[22:01] the only chapter in the book of Philemon
[22:03] amen
[22:06] it is very hard to find right hidden in
[22:10] between the book of Titus and the book
[22:13] of Hebrews
[22:22] the first verse reads Paul a prisoner of
[22:25] Christ and Timothy our brother and to
[22:28] Philemon
[22:29] our dearly brother and fellow laborer
[22:31] but we just want to focus on the first
[22:34] line which says Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[22:37] Christ amen
[22:38] we can all take our seats amen
[22:50] we understand that um Paul wrote this
[22:53] letter to brother Philemon whilst he was
[22:57] in prison and he was seated there he was
[23:03] sitting all the book he was seeing all
[23:04] the bars that way around him and he had
[23:08] had a prison experience for quite a
[23:10] while we know that most of the letters
[23:12] that he wrote which makes the oath the
[23:16] New Testament he wrote these books
[23:18] whilst he was in prison and he had had
[23:21] all these experience and we realized
[23:25] today that we were set on a path of free
[23:30] moral agency when God created the earth
[23:33] he said every CH and every man to be
[23:36] able to decide which side they want to
[23:39] go to the side of the right or the side
[23:42] of the wrong which is either the side of
[23:44] God or the side of Satan so today you
[23:49] can decide to be a prisoner of God or a
[23:52] prisoner of Satan we know that a lot of
[23:57] people each and every one of us we are
[24:00] bound by something knowingly or
[24:03] unknowingly amen some are bound and are
[24:10] in prison to the spirits of addictions
[24:14] some are imprisoned by drugs some are
[24:18] imprisoned by evil spirits
[24:21] some are imprisoned to habits dirty
[24:24] habits and they just don't know it but
[24:28] we thank God that us tonight we know we
[24:31] are prisoners of Christ amen
[24:34] so we just read a quote on what the
[24:38] Prophet says about free moral agency in
[24:45] the message a prisoner since now we are
[24:48] all born a free moral agent to make any
[24:52] decision that we wish to God justly does
[24:55] that because he must put every man on
[24:58] the same basis or he put the wrong man
[25:00] on he put the first man on the wrong
[25:03] basis
[25:04] that he put on free moral agency he
[25:07] makes it fair for each and every one of
[25:09] us to choose which way we want to go to
[25:11] you because each and every one of us
[25:13] we're going to be answerable at the day
[25:16] of judgment of the choice that we made
[25:18] but we know that by predestination with
[25:21] the Bride of Christ we can never be lost
[25:23] a man and we wanted we want to thank God
[25:27] for that and you have to choose you
[25:30] cannot be a fence you cannot be on the
[25:32] fence or a fence believer because Paul
[25:35] taught us you cannot save two masters at
[25:37] the same time you just got to take each
[25:40] either of the two amen and we know that
[25:44] initially when we were born we were born
[25:47] in sin shaped in iniquity and we were
[25:50] bound by sin and we were prisoners and
[25:53] slaves to the devil a man but Jesus
[25:57] Christ he came God came down on earth
[26:02] and we called him Jesus Christ
[26:06] a man and he went to the cross of
[26:08] Calvary two thousand years ago to set us
[26:11] free from the bondages of sin that Satan
[26:14] had placed us in a man and he freed us
[26:18] from sin so now today we can rejoice
[26:21] because there is no sin that can bind us
[26:23] we are free from shame we are free from
[26:26] guilt amen this is what Christ did for
[26:29] us amen he bought us to make us free but
[26:33] because of the love you showed us we are
[26:36] his prisoners by free will so initially
[26:40] we were prisoners unwillingly to the
[26:44] devil because of the fall in the Garden
[26:47] of Eden all of us came that way born in
[26:51] sin and shaped in iniquity we couldn't
[26:54] do anything better but when Christ came
[26:56] and he set us free because of the love
[26:59] he showed us we come unto him and offer
[27:02] ourselves to be pleased to be his
[27:04] prisoners amen
[27:05] I know a lot of people they say well
[27:09] this is a cult that's a crowd they
[27:11] believe in account where they oppress
[27:14] their women they cannot have joy
[27:18] don't go clubbing they don't drink they
[27:20] don't smoke they believe in a cult but
[27:23] we know that's not the case no one is
[27:25] forced to do that we do so because we
[27:28] love the Lord Jesus Christ amen and it
[27:31] is because of his love that we can we
[27:34] cannot commit spiritual adultery by
[27:37] indulging in the devil so-called fun
[27:39] which we know his death amen
[27:42] and we love him that's why we cannot
[27:45] cheat on our Lord Jesus Christ amen but
[27:48] we are in an affair with him and we love
[27:51] him and we are part of him that's why we
[27:54] are called mrs. Jesus Christ we no
[27:57] longer have the desires of the worldly
[27:58] things but only the desire to be holy
[28:01] like our Lord Jesus is amen we are not
[28:04] perfect but we know he makes us perfect
[28:08] for Paul told us if you have the love of
[28:12] the world then the love of Christ is not
[28:14] in you and you cannot save two masters
[28:17] at the same time
[28:19] amen that cannot happen you got to
[28:22] decide and going back to Paul his
[28:28] experiences what ended up making him to
[28:31] come up with the analogy of being a
[28:33] prisoner he was typing he had been he
[28:37] had gone through all the experiences of
[28:39] being a natural prisoner to those guards
[28:43] in the prisons and he had seen all the
[28:45] way he had gone through and he saw
[28:47] that's what he had decided to do for
[28:50] Christ but willingly a man when all Paul
[28:53] was a great scholar and he was quite
[28:56] ambitious he trained under Gamaliel the
[29:00] great teacher in his day who was the
[29:02] high priest and today maybe old equate
[29:06] that to one of the top Bible schools
[29:08] maybe one of Billy Graham's colleges or
[29:10] University of the Bible and we know he
[29:14] was quite educated and very smart healed
[29:17] the Bible from cover to cover and this
[29:20] was what he had done ever since he had
[29:22] grown up and he trained from as a teen
[29:27] the age of 10 years till he was around
[29:30] 35 years
[29:31] so that's about 25 years just studying
[29:33] the Bible so there is nothing you could
[29:35] tell him he was a very great theologian
[29:38] a man and he had committed starting to
[29:42] the scriptures or the rest of his life
[29:44] and we know that he was set on a path to
[29:47] be the high priest or one of the great
[29:50] priests a man because he had he was
[29:54] going he was raising up in the ranks in
[29:57] the religious world a man and he was
[30:02] probably gonna become the next high
[30:05] priest so the prophets aide or one of
[30:08] the great priests and he was now at a
[30:12] level where he would get personal orders
[30:14] from Jerusalem from the high priest and
[30:18] we know this particular time he was sent
[30:21] with in order to persecute a group of
[30:25] people that they seemed to be in account
[30:28] and these people they followed their men
[30:31] who had a record of blaspheming and he
[30:34] called himself as the son of God not as
[30:38] son of God but the son of God amen and
[30:42] they accused him of they accuse him of
[30:46] being blasphemous a man and this man he
[30:51] also told his followers to drink his
[30:53] blood and eat his flesh a man and they
[30:57] call these people Christians we know
[30:59] that the Christians didn't call
[31:02] themselves Christians but the Bible
[31:04] tells us that the first called them
[31:06] Christians in Antioch amen why did
[31:10] they'll call them Christians because
[31:12] they were acting like Christ a man after
[31:16] the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[31:18] Pentecost he came down a man and filled
[31:22] each and every one of them the 120 in
[31:25] the upper room and the 3,000 that were
[31:27] filled in with the Holy Ghost later on
[31:29] they were acting like Christ that's why
[31:32] they ended up being called Christians a
[31:34] man and this particular day when he was
[31:38] carrying out his orders persecuting this
[31:41] group of people one day
[31:45] at around 11 o'clock in the morning he
[31:49] saw the pillar of fire a man Jesus
[31:54] Christ decided to come down and change
[31:56] him on his spot that he was on amen
[31:59] I don't know if I had a titled my
[32:03] message but the title is a prisoner for
[32:06] Christ amen this day while she was on
[32:10] his horse a very bright light shined in
[32:14] his face and he fell off amen and when
[32:18] he fell off this great voice called him
[32:20] say it's also why thou persecuted it's
[32:24] me and he said who art thou Lord and
[32:29] this is a man Jews do not just call
[32:33] anyone Lord amen and considering Paul he
[32:38] had spent about twenty five years
[32:40] studying the Bible and he had known of a
[32:44] man called Moses when he had met the
[32:48] pillar of fire and he saw the same
[32:51] pattern and he knew that this was God a
[32:54] man and this at this point in time does
[32:58] when God changed the course of his life
[33:00] and he turned him around when he says
[33:03] without Lord he knew that this was God
[33:07] and the voice said I am Jesus Christ
[33:10] whom thou pasok uses that's when he got
[33:12] the revelation that Jesus Christ was God
[33:15] a man and at this point in time that's
[33:20] when God took away each and everything
[33:22] he had learned he turned him around a
[33:27] man we know he had trained for all these
[33:31] years
[33:31] his father had spent a lot of money to
[33:34] train him and all this priest they
[33:36] regarded him to be able to carry out
[33:38] these orders perfectly but then after he
[33:42] met Christ he changed his path
[33:44] completely amen and this scenario this
[33:50] situation he I liken it he saw it was
[33:54] the same that Moses had had and he saw
[33:57] that Moses had spent 40
[33:59] years in Egypt and another 40 years in
[34:02] the desert a man and he's just spent
[34:07] five minutes Moses spent five minutes at
[34:10] the burning bush and that's that come
[34:13] that completely changed his life a man
[34:16] that took out all the Egypt that was in
[34:19] him amen all those 40 years were
[34:22] transformed in just a time of five
[34:24] minutes so we know today that there is
[34:27] nothing that the Holy Ghost and fire
[34:29] cannot burn amen
[34:31] wherever you are we know that it will
[34:34] and can be burnt and God can change you
[34:38] the cause of your life a man if you just
[34:41] get the Holy Spirit in your life so when
[34:45] he saw this pillar of fire he knew it
[34:48] was God for he was a scholar of the
[34:50] Bible a man and he knew that this was
[34:54] this was Christ
[34:55] a man like to read another quote and he
[35:02] says and what a surprise it it must have
[35:04] been to this theologian to say I'm Jesus
[35:06] the very one that he was so against what
[35:11] a turnaround oh it must have been
[35:14] something terrific for this man that all
[35:17] of his ambitions that he had to to find
[35:21] out all that once he had been
[35:24] persecuting his ambitions had drove him
[35:27] to farther away from the main thing that
[35:29] he meant to do and what a great shock he
[35:32] must have been for this apostle when he
[35:34] said when the voice from the pillar of
[35:37] fire said I am Jesus the very one that
[35:39] he was persecuting why persecutest thou
[35:42] me and with paul for all these 25 years
[35:46] he thought he was doing the will of god
[35:48] and he thought that he was on the right
[35:52] track he was right in line with what God
[35:55] wanted him to do but the moment he came
[35:57] across the spill out fire and he had
[36:00] this experience he knew that he was
[36:02] doing the wrong thing and he's God Reed
[36:05] changed the whole course of his life a
[36:08] man and he threw away all the theology
[36:10] he had gained and
[36:12] he was he began to trust in God amen and
[36:16] we know that after this experience he's
[36:20] you want to spend three and a half years
[36:22] in the desert of Arabia and he spent all
[36:26] these three and a half years studying
[36:28] the Bible realigning to what he was
[36:31] supposed to do amen and we know that
[36:34] that's when he made his calling and
[36:36] election sure amen and that's when he
[36:39] knew that he was the first messenger to
[36:42] the Gentiles the one who was supposed to
[36:44] take the word from the Jews to the to
[36:46] the Gentiles amen
[36:48] and so we see that this God like the
[36:53] pattern that he had in the first Exodus
[36:57] we see he repeated it in the second
[37:00] Exodus a man and what you've done in the
[37:03] first Exodus did it in the second Exodus
[37:06] he has to do it again in the third
[37:08] Exodus in which we are in a man which is
[37:12] the back side of the desert experience
[37:14] Moses had the backside of the desert
[37:16] experience whilst he was in median Paul
[37:18] had the backside of the desert
[37:20] experience a man and whilst we are
[37:22] reading the books of Paul we hear him
[37:25] telling each and every time he starts
[37:28] writing he tells them I pull a prison of
[37:30] Christ he is telling them that it does
[37:33] not apply to him alone as the message is
[37:36] to that age but each and every believer
[37:39] who is in that age must go through the
[37:41] same process for them to be able to
[37:44] overcome as in that age a man and we
[37:47] know that in the first Exodus after God
[37:51] had had this experience with Moses he
[37:53] asked Moses to take the whole multitude
[37:56] of Israel to come to the mountain so
[37:58] that he could all the children of Israel
[38:00] could have the experience as well amen
[38:02] and we know in this last day God sent us
[38:05] a prophet a man a messenger and God told
[38:09] him to go he told him to go west that's
[38:12] when he had the full revelation of the
[38:15] word amen and this was the apex of the
[38:18] ministry and we know that this is for us
[38:20] for us the bride the full revelation of
[38:23] the world does what we need amen
[38:25] so each and every one of us we need the
[38:28] desert experience we need the backside
[38:31] of the desert experience amen we cannot
[38:33] make it to heaven without it that's
[38:37] right and it doesn't matter who you are
[38:41] because many times we we try to learn
[38:46] how to be Christians but that's not how
[38:49] that's not how it works
[38:51] for you to be called a Christian you
[38:54] have to have Christ within you and he
[38:57] starts living in you and the people
[38:59] around you who start seeing that you are
[39:01] acting like Christ that's how you can be
[39:04] called a Christian you know nowadays in
[39:07] the denominations different churches
[39:10] they just say you come and just profess
[39:13] that Jesus Christ is now your Savior and
[39:15] now everything is done then you are
[39:18] already saved you have a ticket to
[39:19] heaven sorry it doesn't work like that
[39:21] we have to go through all the way up to
[39:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[39:27] what we need amen
[39:28] this is the whole this is the whole
[39:31] mandate of this message to change lives
[39:33] in our lives
[39:35] amen it doesn't make sense we take the
[39:40] word and start coming up with different
[39:41] doctrines this is a result for people
[39:45] who did not have back to the backside of
[39:47] the desert experienced a man but each
[39:50] and every one it doesn't matter how deep
[39:52] you might want to go to into the message
[39:55] and you know bring out mysteries but if
[39:58] that cannot change your life then what
[40:00] does their mystery good do good to you
[40:02] amen
[40:03] but we all need the Holy Spirit amen to
[40:06] change our lives so we can live like
[40:08] Christ amen and many times we have this
[40:16] notion that we have in Christianity that
[40:22] we have do's and dont's that
[40:23] Christianity is based on do's and dont's
[40:26] the Ten Commandments thou shalt not thou
[40:29] shalt not thou shalt do this and do that
[40:33] don't do this but we should not drink
[40:36] we should not smoke we should
[40:40] to dress immodest or follow the passions
[40:42] of the world and we are told that's
[40:44] Christianity but we tend not to
[40:48] emphasize what the real thing is that
[40:51] being cream what being a true Christian
[40:54] makes you do amen
[40:55] that being a Christian it makes you want
[40:57] to live at holy Christian life that
[40:59] being a Christian will make you want to
[41:02] love your enemies that being a Christian
[41:05] will make you want to dress modest amen
[41:08] that being a Christian will make you
[41:10] want to leave a clean life amen
[41:13] because that's all we are supposed to do
[41:15] to reflect our Lord Jesus Christ within
[41:19] us
[41:19] amen just like the moon reflects the
[41:23] light of the Sun when the Sun has gone
[41:26] down and it's nighttime it is only the
[41:28] moon that sheds light to the world
[41:31] amen and we know that we in layer this
[41:34] year this last evil age where darkness
[41:38] is all over in there Satan's Eden amen
[41:41] and the world can no longer see Christ
[41:43] but Christ decided that you and me will
[41:47] be dropped down on earth from eternity
[41:50] at this time in period so we could
[41:52] reflect his life back to the world amen
[41:56] the world cannot see Christ anywhere
[41:57] else but in you and me hey man that's
[42:00] right and this is a very special time we
[42:05] know a lot of people say well I wish I
[42:07] had lived in Bible days I think I would
[42:09] have been a better Christian no the same
[42:13] decision you made today was the same
[42:14] decision you're gonna make back then
[42:16] whether he lived in Jesus day and Moses
[42:19] day or novice that you were going to
[42:20] make the same decision a man and we have
[42:23] quite privileged to be living in this
[42:25] day because remember Daniel he wanted to
[42:30] live in this day sometimes we sit and
[42:32] marvel at how Daniel he performed his
[42:35] great exploits Shadrach Meshach Abednego
[42:38] and them they were thrown into a lake of
[42:40] fire but it never even Brent a single
[42:43] hair on their heads and we just envied
[42:46] them like oh my I wish I was in that day
[42:48] I wish I was like that but you know what
[42:51] they wanted to live in this day
[42:53] because they knew it was gonna be a
[42:55] living in this day you will receive a
[42:58] greater crown a man so do not despise
[43:01] yourself for living in this age but
[43:03] remember this is the last age and we are
[43:06] living in the full light of the
[43:07] revelation of God's Word
[43:08] amen so we ought to be grateful and
[43:12] thank God for living in such a age and
[43:14] take maximum use of it
[43:16] amen because we have the full weaponry
[43:19] the armor that God has intended to be in
[43:22] place in the power of man so there is
[43:25] not demon that can stand before us
[43:26] hallelujah and so we're leaving in this
[43:31] evil Dark Age as the moon reflects the
[43:37] light of the Sun so are we supposed to
[43:40] reflect the light of the sol amen that's
[43:44] the world sees Christ through us amen
[43:48] because we are living in the greatest
[43:50] time of the revelation of the word amen
[43:54] and we know that the Old Testament was a
[43:57] shadow of the new and we know we are
[44:00] still living in the new testament and we
[44:04] know that as you get closer to the
[44:08] object a shadow is vague as it is
[44:10] further away from the object but when it
[44:13] comes closer it becomes more like more
[44:16] like the object is so as time was
[44:19] progressing from the Old Testament it
[44:23] was becoming closer to what the real
[44:25] thing was supposed to be and we are
[44:28] living in the last age we know we at the
[44:31] last generation before we leave this
[44:33] earth to go back to glory and so the
[44:36] shadow we are becoming more like Christ
[44:39] because we are the ones who are closest
[44:42] to it amen we are supposed to come to
[44:46] such a point where if Christ looks in us
[44:49] he sees his own image amen and we know
[44:55] we are the Bride of Christ and the
[44:57] Prophet told is that if you want to
[44:59] check the condition of the church look
[45:02] at the women in the church that's what
[45:04] tells you how the condition of the
[45:05] church is
[45:06] so we are a representation of Christ on
[45:09] this earth so if the world wants to see
[45:13] Christ they have to look at you and me
[45:16] and you have to think if when they look
[45:21] at you are they going to see Christ
[45:22] because you are the best representation
[45:25] of what Christ looks like amen
[45:28] because we are his church and we show
[45:32] what our groom looks like a man and we
[45:36] are willingly his prisoners we are not
[45:40] forced no we are not and when you are in
[45:45] prison you do not decide what to eat or
[45:49] what to drink a man you do not decide
[45:54] what to dress when you go to prison you
[45:59] are not fussy you don't say no I don't
[46:02] feed these clothes you just have to wear
[46:05] what they give you and we see that a lot
[46:08] in the message a lot of people they take
[46:11] the word and they want to tailor-make
[46:13] the word to fit them it doesn't work
[46:15] like that you have to fit in the word
[46:19] amen whatever clothes that you are given
[46:23] you are supposed to make yourself fit in
[46:25] them amen
[46:27] you do not decide what time to wake up
[46:29] you do not decide what time to sleep
[46:32] amen
[46:33] you do not decide where to go or when to
[46:39] go you have to wait for that amen so we
[46:43] know that we as Christians and we have
[46:47] decided to be prisoners of Christ we
[46:50] just don't decide where to go we wait
[46:52] for him to tell us amen that's why we
[46:56] have to wait for his will to be open
[46:58] unto us we do not go clubbing because we
[47:02] are prisoners amen and he doesn't allow
[47:05] us to go there amen we just don't dress
[47:08] however way we want because he doesn't
[47:11] allow us to do that amen
[47:12] we just don't drink any type of drink
[47:15] because we cannot do that amen but this
[47:18] is the out of our
[47:20] own will of submitting to him amen and
[47:24] we see that a lot in as I was saying in
[47:27] the message we have people splicing
[47:30] quotes and picking the ones they want so
[47:33] that they build their own doctrine and
[47:36] say this is the word but it is not like
[47:39] that we take the whole message from 1949
[47:42] until 1965 amen and we do not cut out
[47:48] anything we take everything because that
[47:49] was what's meant for us amen
[47:52] and so the bride was given this so that
[47:56] it could we could get it ready you know
[47:59] in Revelations the bride is going to
[48:02] make herself ready and we're going to
[48:04] get ourselves ready by the full word
[48:06] that he gave us we do not select
[48:08] anything but we take the whole dot amen
[48:10] it will take it as it is and every
[48:14] objects Exodus has the same pattern
[48:17] repeating after the other we know the
[48:20] first Exodus was moving from one country
[48:23] to the other
[48:24] and the second Exodus it was changing
[48:27] from one religion to the other it's
[48:30] changing from Judaism to Christianity
[48:32] and we know that in the third Exodus is
[48:35] a moving from one body to the other from
[48:40] this terrestrial from being terrestrial
[48:42] being to being celestial being a man we
[48:45] have to leave this 16 element body and
[48:47] move to being celesia amen and for you
[48:51] to be successful in each and every
[48:53] Exodus you need the backside of the
[48:55] desert experience a manual and the
[48:57] backside of the desert experience in our
[48:58] day is receiving the Holy Ghost and
[49:00] power amen this is what will make your
[49:03] body to transform that will make your
[49:06] inner man to burst out and go back to
[49:08] where we came from amen hallelujah you
[49:12] know Moses had the burning bush
[49:13] experience and that gave him strength to
[49:15] face Pharaoh and that made him
[49:18] successfully carry out the commission
[49:19] God gave to him amen and as we said
[49:23] earlier on five minutes in the presence
[49:25] of God all the 40 years of Egypt was
[49:28] cleaned out of him and there was left
[49:30] not even one speck a man Paul had the
[49:33] desert
[49:34] the backside of the desert experience
[49:35] and he was no longer afraid to carry out
[49:37] his commission spreading the word from
[49:40] Judaism to being Gentile a man and with
[49:45] a message that william branham preached
[49:47] believing that word we know it will only
[49:50] to surpass from the healing of the body
[49:53] although we still need that there's
[49:56] nothing wrong with the healing of the
[49:57] body we still need it because so long as
[49:59] we are living in this body we are going
[50:01] to get sick and we need that healing and
[50:04] healing we know it's an earnest of the
[50:06] rapture amen and that's why we need that
[50:09] faith because when we are working that
[50:12] faith when our bodies are sick our faith
[50:16] is being built until that point in time
[50:18] when God sees we are ready and we have
[50:21] faith to be able to leave out of this
[50:22] body amen each and every one of us need
[50:26] that experience but today we do not need
[50:29] to go down to Tucson we don't but
[50:34] wherever you are even right now you can
[50:37] have the backside of the desert
[50:38] experience amen and you will not be
[50:40] ashamed to carry out the bride's
[50:42] Commission and we know that our
[50:44] Commission is greater works than these
[50:46] shall you do amen and we were told that
[50:49] greater works is imparting eternal life
[50:52] to others amen
[50:54] this is testifying testifying the word
[50:56] amen because when you have the Holy
[50:59] Ghost within you you want to let
[51:01] somebody else know amen
[51:04] I came across this other quote where the
[51:06] brother branham AusAID it is not fair
[51:09] that you hear the message two times and
[51:11] somebody else hasn't had it I was like
[51:15] wow I'm so guilty a man - you say two
[51:20] times you know just ask yourself how
[51:23] many messages have you heard how many
[51:26] people have you witnessed - that's not
[51:30] fair you gotta let somebody else know
[51:33] the good news that you have within you
[51:34] because when you have the Holy Ghost
[51:36] within you and you have the excitement
[51:39] that of Jesus that you have you really
[51:42] want to let somebody else to know amen
[51:44] wherever you are you want to let someone
[51:46] know about
[51:47] the goodness of God and you want them to
[51:49] see the light of the day amen and we
[51:52] cannot make the rapture without this
[51:54] experience we cannot have overcoming
[51:57] power without the Holy Ghost we need the
[52:00] backside of the desert experience amen
[52:03] and we cannot leave above the earth we
[52:06] know we are girls born to saw above
[52:09] everything that this earth has and we
[52:12] cannot be affected by that but you need
[52:14] the Holy Ghost
[52:15] I need the Holy Ghost for us to be able
[52:17] to leave to leave above the earth a man
[52:20] and we cannot overcome lust if you don't
[52:23] have this Holy Spirit amen
[52:25] and we are supposed to overcome it
[52:27] because we have a promise that Jesus
[52:29] promise that after that after I'm going
[52:31] out sending the Holy Ghost and power
[52:33] amen and we know that there is nothing
[52:35] that can stand in our way when we have
[52:38] this Holy Ghost in power amen
[52:40] we cannot overcome last without this
[52:42] Holy Ghost
[52:43] we cannot overcome addictions we cannot
[52:46] overcome hate we cannot overcome the
[52:50] demon of depression amen
[52:52] we cannot overcome fear which is the
[52:55] greatest enemy to the church amen
[52:57] we cannot have power over diseases if we
[53:01] don't have the backside of the desert
[53:02] experience and we cannot overcome
[53:05] anxiousness we know we are in an age of
[53:08] anxiousness people are just anxious
[53:11] neurotic age the Prophet says people
[53:14] doing crazy things but we know we can
[53:18] get away from that if we receive the
[53:21] Holy Ghost like Eagles we saw above none
[53:24] of that can affect us amen but if we
[53:28] just you to him and have this experience
[53:30] and become his prisoners willing
[53:32] willingly we have the same power as he
[53:35] had because in Romans says if the same
[53:37] power that was in Christ dwells in you
[53:40] we know that we're going to have a
[53:42] transformation of our body amen
[53:44] and we know and we have this experience
[53:48] and become his prisoners we have the
[53:50] same power as he had a man because he
[53:53] will be speaking through us amen and
[53:57] nothing can stand our way we want to
[53:59] even fear death
[54:01] because we know that our Christ overcame
[54:03] it so we also are able to overcome amen
[54:06] no disease can stand before us amen
[54:09] because this power that he bestowed on
[54:11] us there is nothing that can overcome it
[54:14] we know that arm
[54:16] well usually African kids usually know
[54:20] this that you know these days this
[54:25] notion that African parents usually like
[54:27] to send to send their kids very much
[54:30] even if if they're in the even if they
[54:33] in the living room and you're in the
[54:35] bedroom they'll call you to go get some
[54:37] water from the kitchen for you God does
[54:41] not do that when he sends you he comes
[54:45] in and steps within you and he does what
[54:48] he has sent you to do it within you he
[54:51] is the one who do it so we cannot say it
[54:53] is no longer us but it is Christ who is
[54:55] living in us and we have no we have no
[54:59] fear to go against these demons because
[55:01] we know we are not the ones who are
[55:03] doing it it is Christ who is doing it in
[55:06] us Amen because we know of the sons of
[55:09] sceva they saw Paul and them doing these
[55:13] miracles they thought while we are able
[55:14] to do it also and they went to these
[55:17] demons they tried to cut them out these
[55:19] demons asked Wow
[55:21] Paul we know so and so we know so and so
[55:25] we know but who are you because they
[55:29] didn't have the Holy Ghost within them
[55:31] they didn't have that power that could
[55:33] chase away these demons a man so we know
[55:36] we need this power in us that he
[55:39] bestowed in us a man because he told us
[55:41] he shall receive the Holy Ghost and
[55:43] power that's why we see we got the power
[55:46] in the name of Jesus because we know
[55:48] that's the only power that can make hell
[55:51] tremble is the only power that can chase
[55:53] away demons amen
[55:55] it's the only name that when he'll hears
[55:58] that name they all fall into a coma
[56:01] amen we have to come to a point where we
[56:05] say God use me as you will and we have
[56:09] to say I surrender all to thee because
[56:12] he called us on this earth for your
[56:14] purpose
[56:15] and each and every one of us we have to
[56:18] ask God to reveal his purpose within us
[56:22] just like Moses Paul brother branham all
[56:27] of us we need to ask God to tell us what
[56:31] our purpose here on earth amen
[56:34] because without that you are always
[56:36] second-guessing yourself and you cannot
[56:40] be convinced by someone else
[56:42] because if someone convinced you someone
[56:44] else can come in and convince you that's
[56:47] why you only need him to vindicate his
[56:49] word in you and you have to have him to
[56:51] come and live with in your life a man so
[56:54] we have to ask God to reveal his purpose
[56:56] in our lives we have to ask him to come
[57:00] in and we surrender ourselves so that he
[57:04] can have food preeminence so we can be
[57:06] full prisoners to Christ amen because we
[57:09] know that through Christ we can able to
[57:11] do everything amen we thank God for that
[57:14] you can all stand up on our feet amen
[57:26] I sing this song

[1:06:40] our desire to be a prisoner for Christ
[1:06:42] in every way and sometimes you know you
[1:06:46] look at things the way they are I like
[1:06:48] the way the brother said it when you
[1:06:50] imprison you you don't decide when you
[1:06:53] eat you don't decide what you dress you
[1:06:56] don't decide who comes visit or when you
[1:06:59] know you don't go out and you don't come
[1:07:01] in at will the perfect will of God must
[1:07:04] be done and I love that by God's grace
[1:07:07] that's it
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:12] a lot of times people don't know how
[1:07:16] difficult it is to stand behind this
[1:07:18] desk and deliver the Word of God but
[1:07:21] until you behind here you never
[1:07:24] understand it is a very difficult thing
[1:07:27] I was just listening to the prophet of
[1:07:29] God and only on the message on a message
[1:07:32] this evening and he was saying the
[1:07:35] greatest one of the greatest gifts that
[1:07:37] a man can do is to have is to get
[1:07:39] himself out the way and that is a task
[1:07:42] in itself to be able to move your person
[1:07:46] out of the way so the person of Jesus
[1:07:48] Christ has come in and have his way so
[1:07:51] we thank God for our brother moving out
[1:07:53] of the way every man has his own way of
[1:07:56] deliverance but it doesn't matter as
[1:07:59] long as it's delivered I love that he
[1:08:04] men who appreciate him in the morning
[1:08:14] winner
