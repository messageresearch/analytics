amen it's a great privilege for me to be here once more and I want to thank but I die in exchange for holding on and trusting in the Lord that all this effort very soon will be rewarded yeah amen I just want to add you to pay attention to my we are speaking I don't know I don't speak the American way I don't know how many of you have traveled to Scotland or Ireland before the speak English but it's very difficult to understand what they are saying unless you stay with them for some time so I'll do my best to pronounce the where's the way you pronounce them but forgive me if I pronounce them a ghanian style for instance you say wara we say water so the tea is pronounced so just pay attention because I really want what I'm going to say to sink into your heart so I want you to pay a lot of attention to what I'm saying so that you can understand me I know that when preachers are preaching often we say that the Spirit has taken over and we speak very fast and the people don't especially those who don't speak their language very well that people don't get anything I try to go at a pace that I want you to really understand what I'm trying to say so bear with me and just bring your yes a little closer to me and hopefully you'll get everything that I'm about to see god bless you Oh shall we be on our feet let's turn our Bibles to Acts chapter 10 and let's read a little bit about a story of Cornelius Acts chapter 10 if you will let's bow down our hearts and our heads and speak to the author of the word before we read a word precious Heavenly Father a king of kings and a lot of laws this morning we thank you your children are gathered once more another shed blood to break the bread of life Lord your words see it there our fathers ate manna in the wilderness and they are all dead but a bread that you will give us when we eat it Oh hunger no more this morning we are gathered around that it can operate even a word of life the seed of life pressures Heavenly Father come Oh God and travel this course with us this morning even as you travel the cause with those two brothers that Jenny from Jerusalem to Emmaus Lord come and explain your work to us come and break this bread that we'll eat and hang on no more precious father take me out of the way and let your spirit II control this morning like glory divine descent upon this altar and speak to your people Lord keep them hats now to receive your weight that the water not coming from you what are the way in the world we terminate and flourish this we ask in no other name by the matchless name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen let me read from verse 1 to 6 then I'll jump to 34 so there was a certain man in Caesarea Cornelius a Centurion of the band called the Italian band a devout man and one that feared God with all his house which gave much arms to the people and pray to God always he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying unto him Cornelius when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord and he said unto Him thy prayers and thy arms I come up for a memoria before God and now send men to Joppa and call for one Simon whose surname is Peter he loaded in with one Simon a Tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do verse 34 then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh rushes righteousness is accepted with him the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all the word I saw I see you know which was published throughout all Judea and begun from Galilee after the baptism of John who John preached how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him and we are witnesses of all the things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom this is new and hung on a tree him door raise up the teddy and shoot him openly not to the people but on but on two witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins now what was 44 Wow pitaya speak this words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which had the weight amen shall we pray Lord may you bless the reading of that word this we acts in Jesus name Amen let's be seated brethren beloved in Christ today I want to speak to you about a gem of life a bra bra bra Abraham called the gem of life and I want to tackle it from the viewpoint of the new base amen beloved you remember that when Jesus Christ came the first doctrine that Jesus started preaching was about the new base that was Jesus Christ this doctrine a man called Nicodemus went to see Jesus by night he was a Pharisee a scribe and notable religious leader of his day and as it he began to talk to Jesus he says told him something that marvelled him in John 3 Jesus told him that except a man is born again that man cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus was taken aback how can an old man like me be born again am I going to entice second time into the womb of my mom to be born again Jesus said oh let me use my African expression say oh you mean you are a ruler of Israel and I'm telling you at least and you don't understand me what did I begin to speak to you about heavenly things said verily verily I say unto you the Prophet told us at the very very least absolutely absolutely I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God beloved and I want to say this I don't know how many of us have paid attention to Rev run's message number brands message is not only a mess is not just a conglomeration of mysteries Rob ROM came with a single purpose Amen that Christ who live in a believer again as it was a pentacles amen brother and there is a process but with God s that hallelujah so brethren the bronze team if you read his message carefully one of the longest messages broblem ever preached was the spoken word is the original seat now if you study this message carefully LeBron was trying to tell the people about how that gem of life must come into their hearts amen and now how Jim must be water to grow to reproduce Christ amen so brethren why is it that when Jesus Christ came he started talking about this doctrine about new Beth because you are the Old Testament it was on the doctrine amen beloved it is because the master physician had come umbrella and if you are 65 you are sick and you visit a hospital what the doctor must do is to diagnose what that ailment is if that doctor does not diagnose that other ailment is and he gives or prescribes any medication for you you are better off not taking our medication a good physician will always tell you how the problem is hey I can see your prep the blood pressure is up this way I can see your sugar level he stays I can see a tumor form in some way something he has to be able to diagnose why you are not feeling well Jesus Christ came the whole human race was sick and true from the Garden of Eden people didn't understand exactly what the problem was why is it that every generation gets further away from God this has been how a lot I mean when you when you met your parent when you were growing up our parents who tell us oh in our days this is my father would not accept this in his house you all know that yeah but anything at all goes you can weigh anything you can dress anyhow and anything at all is accepted Alleluia so every generation is getting further and further away from God so Jesus came out with the diagnosis diagnose the problem and the diagnosis was our death the way we came into this world is the cause of our problem so jesus said the only way the only prescription the only medication I can prescribe for the human race that would totally kill us of our ailment is to be born again hallelujah unfortunately this terminology born again has been misunderstood and has been bastardized by Christendom everybody has his own interpretation to it when you go to church and minister lays hands on you start speaking alababama in unknown tongue then you are born again among the pentacle star amen I'm on message believers when you read Marella brands message and you believe it you are born again so a lot of interpretation there is no time for me to get into that interpretation I want to hit on the key things amen so brethren there was something wrong with the way we came into this world if you if you go back to Genesis from the beginning everything that God created everything that God made a man was by the spooking way so everything that is original is by the spoken word amen so man or men we are today we all know we didn't come by the spoken word rob rom said we came by hybridization hallelujah we are hybrid and that is why us in every generation we are getting weaker and weaker and weaker hallelujah take a hybrid corn grow it maybe the first year you get what you are supposed to get from your harvest but you cannot replant that watch what you go from your field dead following here I mean farmers here know what I'm talking about an Iowa is full of confirming sue you can replant it Amen when a donkey and a horse is cross it's called the offspring is called a mule and that meal is important it can't reproduce itself because it's a hybrid so the reason why the human race cannot produce reproduce God on earth we cannot because the humans humans were created in the image of God from the beginning so if we were created in the image of God then we are supposed to reproduce God but the hybrid cannot reproduce itself that is why we continuously hybridized hybridized we have become weaker and weaker and far and far away from God hallelujah so Jesus Christ came with this prescription he said there is a simple cure for your problem new base in a new birth no no other prescription can work pray for long hours is good but it will help you amen unless you are born again so absolutely absolutely except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you want to see the kingdom of God what you require the prescription my sister is to be born again hallelujah so how do we get I mean how do we get reborn how do we get this new base ready I'm saying this morning that the mysteries that are contained in this message are good I had somebody the last time I went I wasn't somebody said we should go deeper one of the preachers who preach was talking about how we must that ministers are preaching too many shallow things on us go deeper the deeper things are good I have nothing against them but if Brahm said if you don't get your ABC right I can't teach you algebra you first have to get you a 1-2-3 well known then when I tell you that 2x minus 3b plus 6x is equal to then you can solve that equation isn't it so how can I be teaching simultaneous equations and teaching you complex numbers and all this mathematical stuff if we don't have your ABC right ready so I'm saying that at the core of the message that we believe is a new bed and a baptism of the Holy Ghost and broblem clearly says that in the message but it doesn't come so because people are so fixated about mysteries that they don't see that well now you can know all the mysteries in the world that's why Paul said that you can preach all the mysteries you don't know all the mysteries if we don't have charity you have nothing that's it very so it is not about the intellectual knowledge of this message because how many teams do you have to play to know everything you paint there is just one prescription new base and if you strive for that and achieve that all other things shall be added okay amen so brother let's look at the natural birth we're all born the Bible says in C we worship in iniquity whether we were born because of the world we were born we came forth with an evil nature that is inherent in us ran away you were born all the bad things that you ever did nobody taught you how to do it it meant if you ever stole nobody taught you how to steal mother sister if you ever fornicated nobody taught you how to do that it is the way you were born is an evil leader that makes you to do that now if you look at the Bible even in the Old Testament right from the beginning Jesus Christ or God was portraying this change of nature to us now if you take the life of someone like Jacob for instance brother Brahm use him as a type if we look at the life of Jacob you realize that Jacob was born as a planter a deceiver and that's the life that he led the Seavey's brother went to Laban the same level when he was coming back to his leg he started praying say Lord I've lived led this life for long let something happen and God came down he recognized the presence of God wrestle with God hallelujah all the angel of the Lord hallelujah the angel touch is heap amen and his life was changed his life was changed to the extent that when he went to Joe to Egypt and Joseph was telling him that tell Pharaoh that you are Shepherds oh don't tell it tell him that you are I think your Shepherds noting that you had cattle or something like that yeah because Egyptians don't like that profession when Pharaoh came he didn't he didn't tell a lie he told favor the truth of who they are even listen to the son that's how change he was so in in the Old Testament there were types let me ask you God once change a king from a king to a beast who did that God how did he learn how to kill grass like like a cutter like cutter God he grew close like a beast who did that God after the 7 years were accomplished King Nebuchadnezzar was changed back to a human being who did that God amen so God has been exemplify has been typing we can see that shadows in the Old Testament but there is no time for me to bring this to you let's get to the point so physically for a child to be born a seed has to be planted in the physical wound of the woman by a man is all right now you realize that if the man is impotent or if there is something wrong with the womb of the woman conception cannot take place nature cannot be born amen so in planting of a seed two great requirements number one the seed must be a good seat Nomar to that ground on which the seed is to be planted must be good ground if any of these two things are no good you can't have a crop the seed cannot dominate is all right good so brethren the man who plans this seed as I said earlier must be a career of a viable seed now things Charlie now the seed that is planted in a believer is the Word of God when he goes looked after it is dead the proble of the sewer Jesus Christ interpreting the Bible said the seed is the word of God and that seed is planted in the human heart but you know we have four kinds of hearts we have the stony had a rocky heart we have the wayside hat we have the tawny heart and have the feather hat hallelujah unless that seed falls on the fourth kind of arts amen so brethren the word that you are hearing from here is a viable seed now if the believer City here doesn't have the fourth kind of art hallelujah doesn't have the feta hat that a seed who fall on that seed will be of no effect it doesn't matter how much the sewer plants the seed will be of no effect amen think I mean these things the natural we know table is the spiritual some couples cannot have children it's either way either the man has a problem with his seed or the woman has a problem with the womb and we know by this message that the wound a spiritual wound which we receive the seed of God is the heart hallelujah so brethren for one to have the new bed amen seed must be planted inside you and this seed problem said first comes to the womb of the mind then from the womb of the mind it drops into the heart hallelujah the spirit comes to water it and it breathes for food is that right Amen so beloved in Christ it's very important that we are sure that that seed is viable the seed cannot be a denominational seed I'm talking to each other and you know but it's not seen it's not a viable seed it can't reproduce Christ to reproduce denomination I are you following good so barren you realize that Oh manner of problems now physically the woman's womb has all manner of fibroid is one of the things like that he chokes it doesn't allow the seed to germinate it may be the same way the spiritual heart has all manner of difficult guts SM often an ally who talked about the conditions on the heart lay down but for now I want to emphasize on the career of the seed the career the seed is very important this message is a message where people I mean people have grown to the point where they don't to listen to anybody anymore they think that they come leaplet caves and by playing clips and living right that is it but that cannot give you a new bed that is not how God ordained it now if you watch the scripture that will just read an angel appeared to Philip but God has no ordained angels to preach his word so how did the angel do the angels sent an angel up not to Philip to Cornelius the angels and Cornelius to go fetch the man that is a carrier of the viable seed really so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how religious you are how good a believer you are I remember when I used to preach to my mom you know when I went you then I lost my mother when I used to preach to her I might now tell me that look I don't jealous anybody I don't kill I don't commit adultery I don't do this I live well so I'm already a child of God I said mom it's not about that you can live all the good life if you don't receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior the correct way you will be you you I mean you'll be doomed fortunately on the 28th of December oh-wee five children of my mother away we went to the village together and my mother called us and told us that she wanted to be baptized and I said well I don't want to baptize you if somebody is forcing it on you I want I want you to be from your heart it is something that you you really want if somebody is forcing you to be baptized that would not work it's a notes from my own heart but then give she gave us a condition she said she wanted her religious regalia I know my mom belongs to some of these African traditional religion so they have the religious regalia say her religious regalia the one the instrument of divination that we use is with a spiritual leader from where she comes from a hometown so we have to go get that team and Bennett I said no problem I fix I fix generate a 28th this this year for the baptism so I told my fellow ministers in around the country now I mean this is going to be a big thing in my hometown because everybody knows my mother so well how deep she is into this African tradition and religion is getting baptized I'm sure the whole village will gala is an opportunity to preach them and we traveled there on that fateful day we got the baptismal pool set in the house the whole house was full with people over 300 people to witness my mom's baptism fortunate unfortunately somehow the devil father who were not getting water I'll arrange for a crack to bring us water to the house and the truck just disappointed us we went to the Riverside ourselves to look for the water the Pampas not working well it was a hassle all the ministers got into the water we said well I'm going to carry her to the river just to baptize it but because of the people present and the fact that some other people may want to baptize wanted to do it in a house in a pool so eventually we got the water we came it was almost 7 p.m. and we baptized it was a glorious ceremony 3 weeks after that she passed away she assented Christ at the knick of time and I'm so grateful to the Lord because I had prayed for the past 20 years for my mother at the point I got stopped praying for her I said well let the will of God be done I never knew it was going to happen it just happened so don't give up if you are praying for somebody for a person to believe this message for the person to believe in Jesus Christ just keep praying and trust in the Lord God Himself would do it at a nick of time hallelujah so probably I was telling my mum this that it is not about how good you live ready Christian it's not about how good you live you can leave a very good life and still be lost I've talked of ask people do you think that in Jericho there was no vegging child in Jericho ago chose to save a prostitute the irony God chose to save a prostitute because the present you believe his word looting there were no priests in Samaria but Jesus didn't go to the priests he went to the prostitute woman very well look a whole rehab told the two spies he said we have had what your God did to those kids on this side of Jordan and we know that this must be the God of heaven she saved herself and her family very it's about believing in God hallelujah living in God so brethren also saying the angel appeared to me kun Elios but God has not ordained angels to preach his word an angel cannot plant the seed of life in you the reason is that girl's way of reproduction is that that seed must come from the body which body the body of Christ are you following just like the seed must come the natural seed comes from the body of the man hallelujah the spiritual seed turns from the body of Christ to the womb of the heart then conception takes place and Christ is formed in a person don't don't don't miss this now amen when the angel appeared the angel did not send Cornelius the priests in Jerusalem Cornelius knew nothing about what has happened Jesus calm died and resurrected and salvation and everything is being preached now he knew nothing about it all he knew was that there was a true God among the Jews and he wanted to sell this God and he taught by giving arms and praying somehow God here and God did here God will always reward your good deeds I said girl always record the Bible says that if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you will receive a Prophet's reward God would never God never forsake you look there was a woman who was dying even burn Abram went and told our woman she had he was in a last stage of tuberculosis TB TB sickness and Brahma and told that she was going to die and I will male somewhere and some people were talking about parabrahmam Hardaway sort of condemning the things that he preaches and the woman was telling them no that's not it what Bob Rahm is preaching is a truth and just by standing for that word bra bra went back and the woman got healed you say oh then God didn't speak to him the first time God spoke to him because I can see a type in the Bible Isaiah go to Isaiah to go and tell King Hezekiah that set your house in order you are going to die as I went to the temple Tim his face look remember my little faithfulness cos and as I again go back and tell him that I've added about 15 more years to his years hallelujah so brethren if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet the Bible says you receive a Prophet's reward we are not believing on to fables we are believing some that is real so beloved in Christ the angel sent Cornelius to go fetch Peter why because Peter was the career of the seed at the time the angel of told Peter repite at cuarto con ella Cornelius just believe that Jesus Christ has died and resurrected and does it you are saved by rain and that is the problem in this message people are believing in a dead God now this is my point what I want to see that a dead person cannot give you new Beth new birth can only come through the body of Christ a career of the Jim let me put it straight this way brethren brother Brahm is dead Abraham cannot give you new Beth and this is the problem in the message people think that by reading or playing the tapes of a LeBron they have been born again a career of the sea somebody see when brother Brahm came with a message he planted a seed into some people or two into somebody then that somebody or those people who does in whom that seed was planted also planted into somebody so you must come across he is a bloodline so you must come across somebody who is in that bloodline to plant a seed in you if you do not come across somebody like that you'll be lost I don't know how to say Claire I again read read we listen Abraham give to Ishmael and to Isaac but Isaac but I smell was not a promise eat do you know that I was yet it was a son of Abraham but don't forget he was also a son of the bondwoman Hagar I think gave birth to twist this time not two sons from different women from the same womb twins born the same day but Esau was not a promise eat Jacob was a promise seed so what if you came across an Esau he planned the city you do a son of Isaac what if you came across Ishmael can he plant the city you did the descendants of Ishmael become is your eye part of Israel did the descendants of Esau become part of Israel so it's a bloodline and God always protects that bloodline amen so brethren it is important that a career of the seed plus a living career of the seed must plant the seed in you it sounds like we say in the Old Testament LaBarbara who preach and say what if Moses had said well in the antediluvian destruction God made Noah to come out and a cough go far would pitch it else I preached it inside and sealed it okay so if God is going to rescue my people let me also make an AK and put it on a tire and let's float in it they would have all died in the Nile but yet the same God that is continuing the same thing I did in the days of Noah deliveries people even see the problem is that we human beings we always believe in a pass the roms are the most difficult team for a human being is for him to listen to his fellow human being to accept the word of his fellow human being it's the same problem of data and Abraham and Cora has God spoken only by Moses very there's nothing wrong with reverence my see that's what I'm saying Bram Browns message is correct and that is the reveal word for word II and every preacher must tap from that way hallelujah but I'm saying that the Bible says that God has placed in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for what for the perfecting of the saints so how do you become perfect and if you do not listen to a human being but somebody has to breathe that word to you but that's somebody can not just be anybody that's what I'm trying to say so before Jesus Christ left the scene he said unto Peter and mattresses they said I gave you the keys of the kingdom so Peter had the keys of the kingdom so he had the authority to open that kingdom to Jews to Samaritans and to Gentiles the three class of people that were existing in those days and we know on the day of Pentecost he opened that I mean he used that key of the kingdom and the Holy Ghost fell upon the people in upper room who were all Jews all right the same Peter listen Simon Philip had gone to Samaria to preach the word the people believed there was one Simon the sorcerer who was be reaching the people who everybody thought was just I mean a mighty man of God but I cannot to be a con man so when Philip went there his DS were exposed and the people all believe in Phillip by watch Philip couldn't pray even though he had been to Pentacles he couldn't pray for the people to receive the Holy Ghost because he was not commissioned to do it the commission was Peter he has to first open the gates of the kingdom to everything he had a key to all these three groups before others could not do it so he sent for Peter and John and the Bible says that when they came to Samaria they prayed for the people and they received the Holy Ghost and started speaking in tongues is all right so the same way Cornelius was the first person among the Gentiles that the holy the Holy Ghost fell on and Cornelius I mean I see also wise that when the angel came an angel from God came to Camille's why is that the angel didn't give him the Holy Ghost why he wasn't a career hallelujah so they had to you see God is specific well in this is key Cole is specific we shouldn't think that we can do things anyhow and still be in a plan of God rain rain it doesn't work that way God is specific this message is specific sisters this message is specific how you must dress it specific it's very important I know who we are we are in the United States of America yeah the land of the free so everybody does it's hard for a preacher to be hard on setting things because I mean people who may just walk away a brother preaches hard even if they walk away glory to God yeah which is hard this generation is Evo is our daughters enlisting you allow ho a little leaving the Bible say living a little living we just live in the whole lump little tu Allah before I realize it has become the norm Amen in Africa back in Africa we are very hard because this is I see sisters wearing this pencil like shoes you know issues with pencil and talking to some of you before about it the message is against it and science has proven that it's for your own health especially you the young ones science has proved I'd even effects the wound conception and everything what I'm preaching about so success in this message these things are not for granted once the prophet of God have said it and your preachers are telling you you listen to it amen so the angel was specific specific he didn't say go and fetch John when he said go this Peter is a japa he's dwelling with analyst I'm a who lives by the seaside call him when he comes he will tell you what he or test to do the angel relieved of all he must do it was the duty of Peter to come and tell him what he must do and at the same time that the angel of the Lord was speaking to him every she was appearing to Peter - Peter saw all these on clean teens and all that said say kill and eat say what Rita don't clean say hog or has sanctified don't : clean you know Peter was still living in his Jewish like God God is patient one of the virtues isn't it God is very patient long-suffering very long suffering and I like that look at the pictures he has heart for the human race if it was any of us in his position would have come down destroy the whole thing by now come on is not pushing our God is patient knowing very well that give him adequate time everybody has everybody can change of course he knows who is going to change from the beginning so brethren pataki and when Peter came Canelo saw him and say wow this demand and the angel has directed meet you then this man is God in flesh you know Gentiles like worshipping things Jews who never worship a man and that is why they crucified Jesus Christ he being a man the kings of God so instantly Cornelius when they bow down before Peter Peter said rise up Cornelius I myself am a man like you I also need some needed salvation just like you amen and the Bible says in verse 44 that's why I says you pay attention to verse 44 he says that while Peter yet speak rarely see the spooky wake somebody must speak the gospel to Cornelius for Cornelius to hear and believe before what he before the Holy Ghost the new birth and the Holy Ghost can come so Brahm is he said while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which had their word which was had their word so a living carrier of the word had to go to Cornelius house and member of the body who had a seed which is the word had to go to Cornelius house speak the way for Cornelius here before the Holy Ghost who come you see God's order amen so seed has to be planted in him and a seed is what brings the change it's when a seed that is planted in you is nourished by the water of the Spirit then Christ is formed in you and when Christ is forming you that changes your nature your desires are all gone the filter things that used to come to your mind are all gone there you are now a new creature you are not a new being a certified vessel that Dow God can use hallelujah amen sobering until Cornelius came across than living witness he could not receive the Holy Ghost even though he received an angel in his house because I've come across people who tell you about how the visitations they are receiving in their rules how angela has appeared to them and if become so arrogant by that I don't listen to another human being again I've seen it it's a lot of witches in this message Barry you don't become born-again by angelic visitations I won I'm saying you don't become born-again by what an angelic visitation you become born-again by a human being speaking the word to you so if a human being as I speak that word to you and you claim an angel visited you and I interchange you I know I'm popular minister in my country who said in 1975 an angel stood behind him and call him and gave him the Bible and that's how he's changed kid his deeds show that he's not born again because I'm injured cannot make you born again ray green the Ethiopian eunuch he was highly educated the right acts I think as after each he was here don't worship in Jerusalem I was returning to Ethiopia was in his chariot he could read and he was actually reading Isaiah 53 amen Philip came then split on a lot led Philip to the child's do you understand what do I really I like his answer he said how can I understand a set em side man explains it to me pretty soon new birth cannot come by you I mean I some peoples have read thousand messages and read five hundred messages so I'm filled with a word that is not that it doesn't come that way so you can't sit at home and say you are playing games and you know come to church to come and listen to a preacher and say you have new bed it doesn't happen now II Philippe Internet chariot and starting from the same screams and he was reading that in anak was reading preach Christ to him then they came to water here's what I hope prevents me so Philip myself spoken about baptism so here's what help prevents me from being baptized the Bible said he went down into the water and he came out and he was baptized that is how he received his salvation amen Gregory in conclusion I want to read something to you from hot harbor LeBron put it maybe I I didn't say it right in paragraph 210 of the message the spoken word is original seed we Ambrym said before the actual spiritual death can take place the word has to find himself true your mind believe it that's why say he died here at my worst and believe it on him that sent me has eternal life why what was the problem with the Jews they say we believe the words of Moses and the prophets but Moses and the prophets are dead and gone here was somebody with them who was a living carrier of the word for their day they rejected our and believe in the history yes it I shall not come to the judgment but has passed from death unto life see so first before my job f can take place he said that wet has to find itself through your mind because you know even the devil before the devil came and work on Eve in the Garden of Eden you have to work on the mind drop a message into the mind of Eve did God said thou shalt not eat of every fruit in the garden he said no God says that we should eat of every fruit but of the fruit that is in the mists of the garden we shouldn't touch it say Oh God knows why because I did I eat of nothing you become like God if such a pondering but I want to be like God she wasn't satisfied with a state in which he was she wanted something higher just like the devil the devil also wanted to hire deeper things isn't it and that's how Eve led the whole human race into this for by reasoning it out the same way for life to come into you the Word of God as I'm preaching this morning it's been drop into your mind amen if you receive it you see the acid ADA Barbara Ham finished which I don't know which message it was he finished which may ask Billy become problem at a point was worried that the things that he was saying the church was not getting it in jeffersonville he was worried that even understand how he was saying so he asked belief the poor who still alive his son Billy did you understand someone this morning he say yes dad brother I knew it you understand if I are not supposed to understand you are supposed to believe it where in which to believe just believe the word of God even when we don't understand it at the moment that is spoken to us what we need to do is to believe it and prayerfully go to study it ourselves ask questions you'll come to understand it progress wonder he said the same as he said now remember God never committed God never committed his preaching and and his gospel to an angel so this one I'm taking my message from said God never committed his message God never commit a his word to an angel so message believers and all this Pentecostal preachers who talked about angelic visitations and all that somebody's asked for him is an injured I called him it's only the major prophet of the day that God deals with that way God Himself comes to plant a seed in him but Rob Rama said in every age in the church ages he said in every age the message of God come from one corner from one man and from that man the message is spread by others who have been carefully taught by them but the careers of the message are not careful to say only what the messenger has said and that's how the message gets contaminated diluted and as time goes on it becomes completely polluted so God didn't commit his preaching his gospel to an angel how many knows that question how many knows that Galatians 1 to 8 said if an angel from heaven preach something else beside what they preach let it be a kiss so the angel is wrong if he is different from the word God can you see poor Aleppo Apostle Paul was so sure and even Apostle Paul I read not you shortly before we close even Apostle Paul when you was caught it was caught himself that called him is that right and he was a disposition a preacher he was not an ordinary preacher like he was on a five fold ministry preacher he was at this position a preacher he was a first messenger to the church ages their fish and each amen but when the angel of the Lord met him when he was genuine from Jerusalem to Damascus and I appeared to him in a pillar who say who are thou say i'm it's hard for thee to kick against they provide persecuted now me and all you know the story what did they angel' do the angel didn't call or God or did go to God didn't call Paul and put him in a room somewhere and say Paul I'm going to teach you because if God does that they'll be confusion but they were living Tereus of the seed already the angel died record Paul today he said go to the city go and look for on an ass and an ass is going to pray for you the scale will fall of your eyes you see and I will use you for my wake so that may Paul to realize that those people who he was persecuting we're preaching the truth otherwise they'll be contradiction among them every one is an angel that gave it to me someone who's hello as for me I met Jesus Christ himself was not on the coefficient in Corinthians this was am of apollos this was I'm of Peter Zampa for that was a confucian hallelujah so the angel is wrong if he's different from the way God came on down below angels and committed it to men which were sons you believe it so God has permitted his word to sons not to angels so I I don't want any angel preaching to me I want human beings to preach to me now Philip had been up to pentacle Jerusalem to worship how many says amen to that the inner he had been with all DDD's and lgd's you know we had all the degrees a PhD and masters and everything but why didn't he get something he come back down studying the prophecy of Isaiah although an angel director Philip to him but the gem of life had to come through the body Philip oh brother now we are on the line where did the gem come from through the angel the angel showed him where to go an angel is a messenger here is a son so Philip is a son right you realize that so you need a son of God to plant the seed in you that's why I said the career of the seed has to be a viable career that's why I don't listen to anybody and say you are born again and then Philip Philip had a gem the message the word that's how a child can be born do you get that Philip laid his hands upon him Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ there comes for the Spirit of God sure now that gem had to come from the body what body Christ's body correct and Philip was a member of the body where in us we are on earth now remember cor said that he's never going to leave him so without a witness so the body of crisis on earth now we are the body and if seed will be planted in anybody to receive new birth that seed has to come from a member of that body otherwise that person is actually bringing V amen now listen the same thing took place in Acts chapter 10 verse 48 Peter was on the housetop and Angel directed him to connealy us house but where did the word come from the body never answer who who feel pretty good feel like traveling up and injure come and said don't worry don't call nothing unclean just go on don't think nothing and while Peter spake these words not the angel not the Cardinal I get in it Wow Peter spake these words what he was the body he had a word the word took hold oh brother my angel directed it but the life come true the body of Christ how many are with me Paul on his way to Damascus I'm reading still cutting Barbra ham from Prague rap for 390 up to 3 up to a run fo fo night I'm going read it on your own said Paul on his way to Damascus a vision directed him but Anna Ananias had the gym had the weight amen the Prophet and and I saw a vision that said go up there lay your hands on him said brother saw the Lord appeared to you in the road coming down here how did he knew he had a weight the word of the Lord came to the Prophet prophesied went up there and said he come he he come has sent me up here I might lay my hands upon you and you will be healed and received the Holy Ghost receive your sight the scales fell off his eyes he rose was baptized the name of Jesus went in the name of Jesus went to steady angel directed it that's right but poor Ananias had the seed jam it takes the Spirit of God the seed to give life eternal my flower this is what is on my heart to tell you this morning that the gem of life just like in a natural it come to the man's body see the woman has the egg but there's no life in that egg I'll add it by itself cannot reproduce it can really produce life had to come from the body of the man for that egg I mean for the woman to conceive all right and I'm saying that that is the same thing in the spirit in the spiritual realm life has to come through a member of the body which body the body of Christ and if their life finds a fatter heart it will reproduce Christ so brother this morning I want you to set yourselves it starts at yourself you've been receiving seed your life is not changing the life is to the same you can look back and say I have no heart I want to be by what I was I'm not can you sincerely look at your past life and tell yourself that even though you are not yet what you want to be what you wear now you can say God in heaven knows whether you can't you can't you can deceive me by you cannot deceive yourself can deceive yourself can you look at your life and say what I was I'm not if you are still hot away before receiving this message and come into fellowship I want to tell you this morning that there's nothing wrong with a seed that has been planted there may be everything wrong with the heart of which it is falling on the womb of the mind on which it is falling as I said until the Sun Sun you are not supposed to understand it you are supposed to believe it all you need is to believe this wait don't reason it and if you can die you see when Paul received this Paul said what I was all the knowledge I gained another feat of the Miller it's a pole attended the most prestigious university at a time Paul was taught by the most prestigious professor of the word at the time a man of wisdom he told the other FRC's say look if what these boys are doing is of God we will be found to be fighting against God but if it was if it's not of God who come to not remember I think a scepter four or five there the man was full of wisdom familiar he to import or so so so was so sure of what he believed he said of his upset as far as the law is concerned I saw I'm blameless you complete me I followed everything to the dot but when I met Christ on the road to Damascus after animals have prayed for me Oh what I was in the past I consider it a stunt I know how Danny's that's C cosas del estanque maybe your past life you were such a prestigious body held in highest US celebrity let me call it ours I know how we call them all these nasty things from Hollywood we call them celebrity there I the nakedness from Hollywood is called celebrity he made maybe a celebrity and you don't want to leave that status rather until you consider that all that pass all the so-called Italy and well lead glory of the passes dunk and ten fully to receive this way death cannot take place in you those things who took the work who took it oh this world is choking the wedding us very time is fast paint the nomination our time is gone this is the time that God is dealing only with the bride nomination each has been sworn out that is why you look at his nominations they are getting worse and worse and worse look at the Pentecostal movement in America it was really on fire and it was from this Pentecostal movement that we in Africa received a message of course the Europeans are brother gospel to us during : the colonial days our dependence on movement uh sprang forth in in Africa came from here now where is it all at the Billy gray harms Oral Roberts all the things that he did in the past where are all these churches now they bind hundred million Jets that's all that's all the process concerned themselves about I had one pastor saying that if he takes a commercial flight he cannot be in a tube of demons so as you see so when you take you sit in an economic class and fly Delta from here to Minneapolis you are in a tomb of demons so he meets a private jet where he can pray and be with God oh my god that's what the Pentecostal movement has become that's the truth that's what the Pentecostal movement has become they I guess because they rejected their messenger they did not recognize that all their visitation God God came down to them Jesus confess to the Jews Rob ROM camp came faithfully Pentecost us for the way the closest their message confess to them they rejected it the team they rejected it by 1960 we are shown it away all the Libra and he demonstrated to them more than any of the approaches that that cannot be man that was caught because they believed in science and manifestations indeed but in signs of manifestations the prophet eclipsed all the oppressors and yet they were jealous about him jealous of him so pretty let's look at our lives let's look back we may not go want to be but the good thing is if you are not what you wear that's you on a good road if you can look back and stealth at yourself you are worse off the hot you where you need to go on your knees you need to come and cry to God now Ram said I didn't say everything but Ron said that see the new Beth is saying you have to wrestle with God like Jacob did and was changed you have to wrestle with God how do you wrestle wrestle in prayer you travail in prayer know this have beat this thing I know it sort of God I want to discard it all I want is Christ in me you pray it reveal and God comes and change you make you humble make you love him make you sweet real sweet just Christ shall be on our feet oh geez you notice on abundantly able to short cycle any God is a blue band and Li able to deliver to deliver God is a blue abundantly evil who to deliver those who trust in he hallelujah don't worry if you don't have it let's bow our heads in prayer pressures Heavenly Father your word has gone forth your truth has been spooking the gem of life flow that is dropped into the womb of the mind and falls into the heart must come from a member of the body Lord is there member of that body has spoken your truth your word lord I pray that you put a hearts that our head is we're in the right condition to receive it Lord Merton's and thistles never choke the wedding them may rocks never make the root of the word not gain ground Lamia the sky not come to steal the word from your hearts but let this word find a place on good grounds well mannered black soils Lord that will spring forth Christ a Christ will be forming every soul in every heart here then our evil nature that were born with will change now because you

that Christ will be formed in every heart has had your way this morning on that glorious morning when you shall appear so joyfully meet you up in the sky and be with you forever more this we ask in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen rising years Abel more than able to accomplish what concerns me today he is able more than able to handle anything that comes my way he is able more than able to do much more than I could ever dream he is able more than able to make me what he wants me to be he's able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today he is able more than able to handle anything that comes my way he is able more than able to do much more than I could ever tree oh he is a bold more than able to make me worthy want me to be who can wash away my sin ooh nothing but the blood of Jesus words can make me golden who nothing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen I trust everybody was blessed this morning the word of the Lord is perfect and we thank God that such a beautiful picture was given one thing for certain we know you got you must be born again and I thank God for the brother it was a perfect picture it was just wonderful because so many people do believe it only a preacher to be saved but throughout the Scriptures we know that God has people in of God you know that's that's one of the reasons why God doesn't ordain women to be preachers they can't carry the see it cannot be a correct birth through a woman preacher and that's what people don't understand it has to be a male it has to be a man it can't be an angel and it can't be a woman it doesn't matter how it looks like oh it's being blessed but looks are deceiving the Word of God right says all whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life was the seed and I think God you know it doesn't throw away all your experiences but when you have an experience every experience must be measured back to the word every experience and we thank God for that I I'm just blessed you know two things I want to say is that all of us have needs all of us have needs all of us even here this morning need more of God I love that it's something it ain't the word that's the problem it ain't the preaching that's the problem it ain't it ain't I've seen I've seen people by the Word of God that I think it's the perfect way it is the only way whether it's now or later it is the word that brings the birth I've seen preached people I've seen in my own when even in Lima I seen a man a brother who's gone on the glory and I've seen a sister by the preaching of the word received the Holy goes right in the service you see how they know not only did was their visible signs but it was also changed in their lives one of my precious friends with one of her best of friends his name was Titus and it was like what a month or later he was home to be with the Lord a new convert I don't even know what he was a whole year old but he knew this message was right amen did help me or in the witnessing feel but I say all of this to say to you by God's grace you know if there's something lacking in your life you know and like like he said about that woo it ain't God's Word yo your heart has four conditions or grounds that it could be and there's only one one ground that's really good when that word bring forth one hundredfold Amen everybody else was the things of the world choke them you know their heart was too hard you know just this so stings and you know Hollywood and all these things you got to forget all of that and if you're not willing to release all that in the heart in the hands of God you'll never be born again you'll never be able to change everything must die is the Prophet God said and rock hallelujah and then when you get that born-again experience then you grow into the perfect statue of Christ hallelujah but your God I have you can't grow into the statue of Christ without the birth first you gotta have it and you and I must understand Amen that that's what God says like I said no aliens transported you into this dimension no aliens gonna take you out of here there's only way one way you came into this earth and that was my birth there's only one way you going out of this earth that's by birth you don't be born again you don't see a new life you see a life or death but you don't see you look oh you said oh god I want to be resurrected everybody's going to be resurrected and the white throne judgment all Devils all demon-possessed everybody that was lost will be resurrected that's what you call the second resurrection thank God about the Lord say blessing on the man are those who who are part of the first resurrection so I say these things by the grace of God I'm not gonna beg you to come and pray and you know what that's like forcing a man and I'm not no but I really believe that somebody in here this morning should have been up here for prayer before he didn't ask for it just a weird one but I've and now be come to the you don't have to come up here but somewhere in your heart [Music] [Applause]
