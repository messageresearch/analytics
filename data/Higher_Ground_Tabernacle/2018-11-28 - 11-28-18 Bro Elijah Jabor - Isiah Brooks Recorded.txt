working [Music] [Music] [Music] being dalla Torian slothful it's so true how he Illustrated we rush everywhere go everywhere but when it comes down to prayer we get tired that's the working of the enemy I want to thank your brother for allowing God to use you tonight somebody has to make a sacrifice and I know that each and every time you guys come here on Wednesday it's always the same room Oh God he sees your efforts and we realized tonight amen but we can always give more always I like the way he says it and the way he put it the way prophet of God said salvation is sacrifice and when sacrifice is something that is given that's going to cause pain you know if I had ten dollars and you wanted five it won't hurt me too bad you say brother Brooks I need ten and that's all like god that's a sacrifice and giving that sacrifice like that you know God sees it and I believe that each and every one of us can look within ourselves and say Lord show me where I can give more where I can be a greater sacrifice for the kingdom of God that's what I was saying tonight as I heard the war word ministered to me and sometimes I think to myself you know I remember brother Branham I had then traveled so much and he was still driving and he was so sleepy and he said he prayed that he wouldn't give over to the lust of the flesh we would have called it high here and warned out who he called it the lust of the flesh it really shook me because I knew that I was guilty it's amazing how we could be so tired and then a friend call or somebody come by and all of a sudden the energy comes from somewhere it's always more you can give less Stan we're gonna take our ties in offense Father we thank you right now for your grace and your mercy I know prayers have gone up before but we pray a gang Lord that you bless those that give and those who have a desire has a doc desire to give bless everything Lord that is given to the furtherance of the ministry Lord and will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name [Music] [Music] stood a new rug across sorry we will exchange some data or crowd when I hear preaching like that the only thing I could think about is we're not last one or so to the Lord I am so burdened about that because it's every day I think about Lord show me where can I go what can I do we witnessed the people we tell them about Christ they come they stop they come they stop I just just came how they take it some time because I know that there's still more people here in Iowa I'm not looking my will to be done but I want to make sure that his will is done God add to the church daily those that should be saved and that's what I pray surely Lord is what I need I trust it's what everybody else is needed to bless our brother Nigel strengthened his body Lord as he traveled tomorrow down to Arkansas God give me what he stands in need of it Lord I pray father God that he realized tonight Lord that he feared us and we were appreciated you feared us Lord through him grateful Lord I'm so grateful for the word Lord we know God Hebrew to help tells us that we all present our body as a living sacrifice a sacrifice Lord where we are not ashamed of the gospel of Christ carrying that cross of the word help us now help us be a greater sacrifice give us grace to give more for your kingdom Lord help us open our eyes and our hearts Lord that we may see the need and we go after the need bless us now as we are dismissed only from this service and never from your presence in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] [Music] you
