[25:31] where we should be by the grace of God.
[25:36] How many are happy this morning?
[25:40] My son, when he found out I was wearing
[25:42] an orange
[25:44] suit, he said the Congalles brothers are
[25:47] getting next to you now.
[25:53] and nobody else is wearing.
[26:00] Amen. Amen. I I blame Gideon

[26:17] this morning?
[26:19] Amen. This is the greatest
[26:21] day, historical day ever.
[26:26] We thank God for his
[26:28] birth to really give praise for his
[26:30] death, burial, and
[26:32] resurrection. Hallelujah.
[26:35] I've got a I've got a I'm just going to
[26:36] go right into the word because we got
[26:38] several speakers this
[26:40] morning and they're going to ring a bell
[26:42] or ring a buzzard or say something. But
[26:45] we've got about 15 minutes of peace and
[26:48] I trust that everybody will be blessed
[26:49] this
[26:50] morning. We're doing a little something.
[26:52] You know, on holidays, this is what we
[26:55] do.
[26:57] We have a good time. Now, Satan has
[26:59] already tried to stop us by taking the
[27:01] lights
[27:02] out. Somebody's prayers brought them
[27:04] back
[27:07] on. We We are here to enjoy Jesus.
[27:12] All right. Amen. So, I know it's warm. I
[27:14] can't deal with too much hot weather. I
[27:17] mean, when I'm preaching, but we'll do
[27:20] the best we can. I'm glad to see
[27:23] everybody
[27:24] here. Those who made it from Iowa City,
[27:27] you appreciate you, the fellowship and
[27:29] the strength and unity that you have.
[27:33] Whenever we ask you to come, you do
[27:35] come.
[27:37] Amen. So hopefully by the grace of God,
[27:39] we'll be able to
[27:41] reciprocate around sometime.
[27:44] Amen. But as we stand,
[27:47] we're going to ask that you turn with
[27:48] us, Isaiah 52,
[27:57] 1 through two. Thank God for my lovely
[28:00] wife and family. Don't
[28:02] my family who
[28:04] are appreciate you. We thank you. Amen.
[28:08] Isaiah 52:1 through2. I'm I'm so
[28:11] happy because of this message.
[28:16] This message in itself is a Easter
[28:19] message because it shows that Jesus
[28:21] Christ is alive and well.
[28:25] So I'm so happy to be one in the number.
[28:28] Isaiah
[28:30] 52 1-2
[28:33] it says, "Awake, awake. Put on thy
[28:37] strength, O Zion. Put on that beautiful
[28:40] garment, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for
[28:45] henceforth there shall no more come into
[28:47] thee the
[28:49] uncircumcised and the unclean.
[28:52] Shake thyself from the dust.
[28:56] Arise and sit down. That means to take
[28:59] your seat, right? Oh Jerusalem, loose
[29:04] thyelves from the bands of thy neck, oh
[29:08] captive daughter of Zion. Let us pray.
[29:12] Heavenly Father, we come before you,
[29:14] Lord. We thank you for your grace and
[29:16] your mercy. We thank you for being so
[29:18] good to us this morning. Father, we pray
[29:21] in this short period of time that you
[29:24] will bless the service, bless the year.
[29:26] May they be free in their spirit. Lord,
[29:29] may they pull on the gifts of God. And
[29:31] Lord, let your shine of glory,
[29:33] hallelujah, come down in this place in
[29:36] your name, Jesus Christ. We give you
[29:38] honor. We give you praise. We give you
[29:40] glory for this wonderful day of
[29:42] celebration. We even though Easter for
[29:45] us is every day. Hallelujah. We're
[29:48] celebrating
[29:50] the Sunday,
[29:52] not su
[29:53] n s o n. Thank you, father, for being
[29:58] good to us. In Jesus Christ's name we
[30:00] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be
[30:03] seated. Isn't it wonderful? You think
[30:06] about it, how uh how strange it must
[30:10] look uh to some people. Uh here we are
[30:15] celebrating a man's death.
[30:20] Hallelujah. But it's not just the death
[30:21] that we're
[30:23] celebrating because many people been uh
[30:26] in that day died. Many people in that
[30:29] day, amen, was
[30:31] crucified. But there's only
[30:34] one that got up
[30:37] and he's alive and well. Coming from the
[30:40] message, rise, the rising of the sun,
[30:43] Paragraph 41. So you'll know where I'm
[30:45] going with this.
[30:47] As Christ was the first one to ride a
[30:50] great
[30:53] from the from all the prophets and so
[30:56] forth all those types in many
[31:01] places. He was the first fruit of those
[31:03] that slept
[31:06] in the bride coming of
[31:09] Christ coming out of the church.
[31:12] They have to be a wave she a sheath
[31:17] wave again in the last day. Now I want
[31:21] you to understand what this is saying.
[31:23] You coming out of the
[31:25] organizations, you coming out of
[31:29] denominationalism is a shadow or type of
[31:31] your resurrection.
[31:34] Hallelujah. And and there must be a wave
[31:38] sheath and there must come one
[31:41] that have reached
[31:43] perfection and is waved over the people
[31:47] that you might see what is coming
[31:49] next. Hallelujah. Right. Amen. So the
[31:54] bride coming of
[31:56] Christ coming out of the church there
[31:59] have to be a sheep waved again in the
[32:02] last days.
[32:05] Right. Waving of the sheath.
[32:09] Now, how many of y'all know what a
[32:10] sheath is?
[32:12] Hallelujah. It's a bunch of wheat
[32:16] tied together. That wheat that have come
[32:20] to a maturity.
[32:22] Amen. And the ceremony was that it would
[32:24] be
[32:26] waved to show the people this is harvest
[32:29] time.
[32:32] more is yet to come. Now, I don't know
[32:35] about you this morning, but I'm part of
[32:37] that which is to come. And can I say it
[32:40] like this? We are here.
[32:44] Hallelujah. My message this morning,
[32:47] Zion,
[32:49] thy God lives.
[32:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm sure
[32:54] you see what I'm talking
[32:56] about. It was waved over the
[32:59] people. And the first time there will
[33:02] come
[33:03] forth. What? The bride
[33:06] age. And this is what we must
[33:09] understand. We're no longer in
[33:11] Leosia. We are in what we call the bride
[33:15] age. Amen. The age of Wesley was
[33:19] good. The age of Luther was good. The
[33:23] age of the Pentecostal was good. But now
[33:27] there is what we call a bride age.
[33:33] Hallelujah. This is the final
[33:35] age. And and what are we looking for?
[33:39] We're looking for a rapture.
[33:41] Oh, come on. Y'all maybe I'm the only
[33:43] one. Let me say that again. We are
[33:46] looking for a rapture.
[33:51] Right. So, you must understand
[33:54] by the grace of
[33:56] God for and the first time
[34:00] There will come forth for the bride age
[34:04] for a resurrection out of dark
[34:08] denominationalism will be a message.
[34:12] Hallelujah. That that's the full
[34:14] maturity of the
[34:17] word again in its full
[34:20] power. Did you hear that? The full
[34:24] word matured into its full power.
[34:30] and being waved over the people.
[34:33] What is Brother Brandham talking about?
[34:35] What is he talking about? He's basically
[34:39] saying, "When you see me, you're seeing
[34:42] the way."
[34:44] You're literally seeing the Christ in
[34:47] me taking over you, introducing you to
[34:51] another
[34:53] age, that age will which will bring
[34:56] forth a full
[34:59] maturity. See, this is why I can't be
[35:03] satisfied with being a church. I'm more
[35:06] than a church. You're more than the
[35:09] church. There are those who are chosen
[35:12] by God.
[35:14] foundation of the world. You have been
[35:16] chosen. You have been elected. And how
[35:19] do you know, brother Brooks, that you
[35:21] have been
[35:23] resurrected? Hallelujah. You're coming
[35:26] out of the uh denominational churches
[35:30] under the inspiration of this
[35:32] message, the rapture has already
[35:36] begun. People do not
[35:38] understand that those who come to this
[35:42] this message
[35:43] This word knows that Zion lives.
[35:48] Hallelujah. This is not a dead
[35:51] church. Hallelujah. But this church is
[35:54] alive. And the reason why we are
[35:58] alive Jesus
[36:00] himself deals with on the
[36:02] inside. Hallelujah.
[36:05] What they didn't know
[36:08] when they crucified him, they didn't
[36:10] know.
[36:12] They didn't know what they were doing.
[36:14] Turn with me to Matthew 27.
[36:16] Hallelujah. Amen. If they had only known
[36:20] he was the Christ. Is that the word? The
[36:24] Bible said they never would have
[36:25] crucified him. Hallelujah. Listen 27th
[36:30] verse of Matthew 27.
[36:33] Then the soldiers of the government took
[36:36] Jesus in the common hall and gathered
[36:39] unto him the whole band of
[36:45] soldiers. This is the part I like. And
[36:49] they stripped him and put on him a
[36:53] scarlet
[36:56] robe. Scarlet is
[36:59] red. Hallelujah. But he had to be
[37:03] stripped
[37:05] and he had to put on a scarlet robe.
[37:09] That robe in itself represented my sin.
[37:14] It represents your sin.
[37:17] Hallelujah. Amen. And what did they do?
[37:21] They didn't
[37:23] understand that though your sins be as
[37:26] scarlet,
[37:28] though they be read like crimson,
[37:32] make them wider
[37:34] than all of this was a
[37:37] process that Jesus would become my
[37:42] sins that he might become the
[37:44] righteousness of
[37:46] God. Hallelujah. And when they had
[37:49] platted crowns of
[37:51] thorns, they put it upon his head and a
[37:55] reed in his right
[37:57] hand. And they bowed the knee before him
[38:01] and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of
[38:05] the
[38:06] Jews." And what they did not know, he
[38:10] wasn't just the king of the
[38:12] Jews. He was the king of the Gentiles.
[38:16] Not only was he the king of the
[38:18] Gentiles, the king of kings and lord of
[38:22] lords. Hallelujah. They crucified like
[38:26] Mary
[38:27] said by my
[38:29] lordifi. He had to be
[38:31] crucified. He had to get die the death
[38:34] of
[38:37] shame. That's the death we would have
[38:40] died. The death of shame. Now watch
[38:44] this. Even in the Old Testament, he had
[38:47] a man by the name of Elijah.
[38:52] Hallelujah. And Elisha
[38:55] who represents the bride. Says, "Listen,
[38:58] I I want a double portion. I understand
[39:01] where I'm going with this. We We're not
[39:03] We don't want a portion.
[39:06] We want a double portion."
[39:09] Hallelujah. That That's our inheritance.
[39:13] And Elijah said unto
[39:16] if you see me going up,
[39:19] if you see me leaving,
[39:21] hallelujah, then will I give you
[39:25] Hallelujah. this double portion. But
[39:28] brother Brandham said it like
[39:29] this. Elisha
[39:32] had to
[39:33] wait for this moment.
[39:37] Elijah
[39:38] died because if Elijah had given him the
[39:41] robe
[39:44] earlier
[39:46] him, so he had to
[39:49] grow in
[39:51] grace in order to fit the robe of
[39:53] Elijah.
[39:57] every
[39:58] man, every woman who can see that Jesus
[40:02] just didn't
[40:05] die. He's the Lord of Lord, the King of
[40:10] Kings. If we can see
[40:12] that as Elijah gave Elisha a double
[40:21] portion, Amen. Amen. That robe,
[40:25] hallelujah, didn't mean s just it meant
[40:28] surrender.
[40:30] That robe also meant
[40:33] victory. Cuz if you know, he took his
[40:36] robe from
[40:38] him. He took the red
[40:40] robe. It represented sin and
[40:46] disbelief. When he rose from the dead,
[40:50] he rose with a white robe.
[40:53] He rose with glorifi glorified
[40:59] ro that's why Paul said oh
[41:05] death's victory thanks be to
[41:09] God victory our lord and savior Jesus
[41:12] Christ know about you hallelujah but
[41:16] when you receive the holy ghost you are
[41:19] receiving the robe of Christ
[41:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isaiah, please.
[41:27] I don't know my time. You got to let me
[41:29] know my time.
[41:32] Isaiah. 52 7-8.
[41:37] Hallelujah. Your your God
[41:39] reigns.
[41:41] We You know, you're going to fight
[41:43] sadness sometimes, but you got to
[41:46] overcome. You got to
[41:49] remember. Hallelujah. You got to
[41:51] understand joy has been given to you.
[41:54] That's
[41:56] your this evil
[41:58] world. Let the world be
[42:01] sad. Don't be
[42:03] depressed. Believe in Jesus Christ. You
[42:06] should be sitting in heavenly
[42:09] places in your
[42:11] heart. I don't know about you, but my
[42:15] focus is making a
[42:18] translation. And I don't know about you,
[42:21] I'm growing in the grace of
[42:23] God. I don't know about you, but I'm
[42:26] getting closer to my
[42:29] goal. It's not me. It's the resurrection
[42:32] in me. It's not you. It's the
[42:37] resurrection. Is that right? He told
[42:40] Mary and Martha, I
[42:42] am. I am the
[42:45] life. Is that right? Come on somebody.
[42:49] That's the way it works. You get the
[42:51] resurrection in
[42:53] you. You should live and never die.
[42:56] [Music]
[42:58] Glory to God. Zion, your God lives. I
[43:02] don't care what's happening in the
[43:05] organization, in the
[43:07] denomination. It happens here. The bride
[43:11] must come to a maturity.
[43:14] Hallelujah. doing the same works.
[43:18] Hallelujah. Isaiah 537 527
[43:23] through8 beautiful upon the mountains
[43:25] are the feet of
[43:26] him bringing good
[43:29] tidings that publishes peace that
[43:32] bringeth good tidings of of
[43:35] good that publishes salvation.
[43:38] Hallelujah. Saith unto Zion,
[43:42] my God reignth.
[43:44] Y'all understand me? That means he king.
[43:47] He reigns.
[43:49] Hallelujah. There is no other
[43:52] god. No other living God. Everything
[43:56] else is
[43:58] man-made. It's not
[44:01] man-made. He made man.
[44:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Thy
[44:07] watchmen shall lift up the voice.
[44:11] With the voice together shall they sing,
[44:16] for they shall see eye to eye.
[44:19] Hallelujah. For the first time in
[44:23] history, we are seeing eye to
[44:26] eye. What do you mean,
[44:28] brother? Our little problems, but we
[44:31] know who the first eye was, and we know
[44:34] who the second eye is. We know who was
[44:36] the alpha and the
[44:38] omega. Paul was the first.
[44:42] prophet of the of our day. Hallelujah.
[44:45] William Brandon was the second of our
[44:48] day.
[44:50] And you know what he said?
[44:52] Everything Paul preached,
[44:55] I preach. Somebody help me here. So what
[44:58] was he saying? We see eye to
[45:03] eye. We can see eye to
[45:06] eye to the almighty. Hallelujah. And
[45:09] Jesus Christ never
[45:11] changed. He came yesterday, today.
[45:16] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[45:19] Hallelujah. And when the Lord shall
[45:20] bring again Zion,
[45:24] what's happening? What is what is what
[45:26] is the purpose of these two prophets?
[45:30] To bring Zion.
[45:32] Bring him where? To their position.
[45:35] Hallelujah. That's why the Bible says
[45:37] shake yourself.
[45:40] from the
[45:42] dust and take a seat.
[45:46] Hallelujah. What is it? Your position.
[45:50] Take your position.
[45:53] Your life. Hey, it's the truth. You must
[45:56] take your
[45:57] position. Don't be afraid of the
[46:00] unseen. It's what we live
[46:02] by. supernatural
[46:05] God, supernatural
[46:07] bride, supernatural
[46:09] people, looked beyond all these things,
[46:14] see what you're talking about. Abraham
[46:17] said, "I see saw a city coming down." He
[46:20] knew, he
[46:22] looked for a
[46:24] city and maker is
[46:27] God. Gord understand me. Abraham knew
[46:31] this bride was coming.
[46:34] Hallelujah. By the grace of God, you
[46:36] love the Lord. Let me let me read one
[46:38] more scripture and
[46:40] I'm finish this the next time. But my
[46:43] point is this.
[46:45] We must advance.
[46:48] We've got to move
[46:50] forward. We can't stay with
[46:55] Pentecost. Our word is higher.
[47:02] We must advance the word of God spoken.
[47:04] We
[47:05] must tell
[47:07] us. You understand me? You know that's
[47:10] why Jesus wasn't a part of
[47:11] denominational
[47:14] or man was not part of
[47:17] nothing. He had to stay without the
[47:20] camp. The Holy Spirit could tell him
[47:24] things. He would not have been able to
[47:26] tell
[47:27] him he was in a cave.
[47:31] And we are not in a cave. Hallelujah.
[47:34] Let me say it to those might be
[47:35] visiting. It is not a cult.
[47:40] Hallelujah. You said, "Oh, brother, why
[47:42] you got that picture up
[47:44] there?" You have pictures on your
[47:48] wall. Amen. You have them in your house,
[47:50] don't you?
[47:53] That's all right. Oh, do you worship
[47:55] you?
[47:57] I you got a frame of yourself somewhere.
[48:01] Amen. Hallelujah. Go to a Lutheran or a
[48:04] Baptist church.
[48:10] Amen. This is not a Seven Day
[48:13] Adventist. We're free.
[48:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if you knew
[48:20] whose picture that was up
[48:25] there, the one that's above
[48:31] the body can't see
[48:33] it given to everybody
[48:36] this know what that is. It's the same
[48:40] pillar of
[48:45] [Music]
[48:47] fire. It's the same pillar of
[48:50] fire that they have from
[48:54] heaven baptized
[48:57] Jesus
[48:59] fire that came above above his
[49:02] head of the
[49:04] world. They think we're idol
[49:09] worshippers. They think we're out of our
[49:12] mind. We see it like this. It's crazy.
[49:15] Those 12 disciples
[49:18] [Music]
[49:22] Sean stood as a
[49:26] witness of
[49:28] [Music]
[49:34] fire. That's science. Science took that
[49:39] picture. Hallelujah. And the camera
[49:43] can't take illusions.
[49:45] It only flashes and take what really is
[49:48] there. Hallelujah. See, it's up in
[49:52] Washington.
[49:54] Right in Washington
[49:56] DC from the people.
[49:59] Our government know that this is
[50:01] supernatural.
[50:04] But they won't tell the
[50:06] people that Jesus
[50:09] Christ yesterday.
[50:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to the
[50:18] Lord. We know what we're talking about.
[50:22] We know what we're talking about.
[50:25] Hallelujah. This is no guessing
[50:27] game. Real thing. I want to say to
[50:31] Zia, your God
[50:34] lives. Your God lives. Your God lives.
[50:39] [Applause]
[50:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[50:44] Hallelujah.
[50:46] Glory to God.
[50:49] Your God lives.
[50:51] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:55] Hallelujah. Amen.
[50:58] [Applause]
[51:12] Because he
[51:16] lives, I can face tomorrow.
[51:21] Oh, because he
[51:26] lives. All fear is
[51:31] gone because I know. Yes, I know. He
[51:38] holds the
[51:39] [Music]
[51:42] future. And life is worth a living just
[51:49] because he lives. One more
[51:52] time because he
[51:56] lives. Oh, I can face
[52:01] tomorrow. Oh,
[52:04] because he lives.
[52:08] All of fear is
[52:12] gone. Oh, because I know. Yes, I know.
[52:18] He holds my
[52:22] future. Oh, and life is worth living
[52:28] just because one more time.
[52:33] Oh, because he
[52:36] lives. Oh, I can face
[52:41] tomorrow. Oh,
[52:44] because he
[52:46] lives. All fear, all fear is
[52:52] gone because I know. Yes, I know. He
[52:58] holds my future.
[53:03] And life is worth a living just because
[53:09] he
[53:10] lives. Oh, God sent his
[53:16] son and they called him
[53:21] Jesus. He came to
[53:26] love, heal, and forgive.
[53:30] Oh, he lived and
[53:35] died. Oh, to buy my part and an empty
[53:40] grave. An empty grave is there to prove
[53:45] my Savior lives. Oh,
[53:49] because because he
[53:52] lives. Oh, I can face tomorrow.
[53:58] Oh, because he
[54:01] lives. All my fear of fear is
[54:07] gone. Because I know. Yes, I know. He
[54:13] holds the
[54:17] future and life is worth a living just
[54:23] because he lives.
[54:29] [Music]
[54:34] message.
[54:41] [Music]
[54:45] Amen. I was saying what a wonderful
[54:47] message for you. Amen. I was sitting
[54:49] there and and asking myself,
[54:53] brother Brooks, why don't you just take
[54:54] the entire service and
[54:58] Amen. Because it's very hard to come
[54:59] next to you know this such a pre after
[55:01] such a preaching
[55:04] and we tried to do our best by the grace
[55:07] of God.
[55:08] Amen. That was that was wonderful. That
[55:10] was Amen. Let's let's turn to Luke
[55:12] chapter 24. We read verse 17 here. Luke
[55:16] verse
[55:17] 86.
[55:25] Amen. Luke chapter 24:1 176
[55:30] the Bible says, "And he said unto them,
[55:33] what manner of communications are these
[55:36] that ye have one to another as you walk
[55:40] and are sad?
[55:45] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. So here
[55:48] you see that after the resurrection
[55:52] and you have these two disciples, I mean
[55:54] these two people walking.
[55:58] Amen. Talking to each other.
[56:02] Amen. But the communication was a sad
[56:04] one. It wasn't it wasn't a happy one.
[56:09] Amen. Is also a sign of
[56:12] happiness. Amen. Because imagine
[56:14] somebody that you thought was
[56:17] dead. Amen. And now you receive the news
[56:20] that that person is leaving
[56:22] again. Amen. You will be very happy
[56:25] because of the
[56:26] news. These two, Amen. If you read the
[56:30] Bible, you'll understand. Amen. They
[56:32] were with Jesus when Jesus was doing
[56:36] miracles. Amen. They were with Jesus
[56:38] when Jesus was telling them what would
[56:41] happen. But here is the same thing that
[56:44] Jesus told them
[56:47] and it has
[56:48] happened but now they're wondering what
[56:50] has what's going
[56:52] on. Remember they're thinking well we
[56:55] thought that this man will stay with us.
[56:59] We thought that this man will set us
[57:02] free. We thought that this man will end
[57:05] all tribulations.
[57:07] We thought that this man would take us
[57:09] out of the Romans
[57:10] end. Amen. But here is our hope is
[57:14] gone. Amen. This man that we
[57:16] thought he's dead and now he's been
[57:20] three days. Amen. So the thing is that
[57:23] the morning of this
[57:25] day, Amen. There so women going to the
[57:29] separ they have met an
[57:32] angel. angel told them, "Why are you
[57:34] looking for a living man among the
[57:39] dead?" Amen. And the disciple went after
[57:42] them as
[57:44] well. And they were told the same thing.
[57:47] Amen. But these two men. Amen. Walking
[57:50] and being
[57:52] sad. Why? The prophet said that they
[57:55] were in disbelief.
[57:58] Amen. It's the same thing that happens
[57:59] to
[58:00] us. Amen. After a great, after a great
[58:04] preaching, Amen. people start seeing the
[58:06] manifestation of the Holy
[58:09] Spirit of them believing
[58:12] it. Amen. They started
[58:14] complaining. Amen. They started asking,
[58:17] "Is it
[58:19] fake?" Amen. Is it a play or it's a
[58:22] reality? Amen. But if Jesus is truly
[58:26] alive, amen, we have to see the evidence
[58:29] of his resurrection.
[58:32] Jesus is not
[58:34] alive. Amen. Jesus is not
[58:37] alive. But for us just to read it on the
[58:40] book, you
[58:41] know, Amen. It's different than
[58:44] Muhammad. It's different than
[58:47] Buddha. Amen. We know that our
[58:49] Christ, Amen, was dead. Amen. And three
[58:53] days after he is
[58:55] alive. Amen. So we have to see the
[58:57] evidence of the resurrection.
[59:00] Because you cannot just tell someone
[59:02] that God is
[59:04] alive without showing
[59:07] him the proof that God is
[59:10] alive. But you have to point him
[59:13] somewhere. You have to point him to a
[59:16] day by not just something that you have
[59:19] heard of
[59:21] yourself. But something within you by
[59:25] telling them this is the
[59:26] reality. Amen. This is the proof.
[59:30] that my God is not dead. Amen. That this
[59:33] is the proof. Amen. That God is
[59:36] alive. Amen. In Matthew 28. Amen. Verse
[59:40] 17. After Jesus was raised up,
[59:44] Amen. The Bible is saying that Jesus is
[59:45] talking to the disciple. Now he
[59:48] says, "And when they saw him, they
[59:52] worshiped
[59:53] him. But some
[59:55] doubted." Amen. You see, there's always
[59:58] doubt.
[59:59] Amen. When people see the manifestation
[1:00:01] of
[1:00:02] God, Amen. There is always doubt. Amen.
[1:00:06] Just to get away from my sermon a little
[1:00:07] bit
[1:00:08] here. There is something that happened
[1:00:10] in Kentucky, a church in
[1:00:12] Kentucky where a person fainted. I don't
[1:00:15] know what happened to her. Amen. And the
[1:00:17] pastor came and pray for that person and
[1:00:19] started it was
[1:00:22] well. Now you have people talking
[1:00:24] thinking that that was
[1:00:26] fake. Amen. people talking and thinking
[1:00:28] that it was something that that a play
[1:00:30] that they they fixed it to happen that
[1:00:33] way. So every time you see the
[1:00:35] manifestation of
[1:00:37] God, you will always doubt.
[1:00:40] Amen. But the thing is the word goes to
[1:00:43] the
[1:00:45] word. You have to have in you a
[1:00:48] seed for the word to come to
[1:00:51] you. Everybody will hear the gospel.
[1:00:55] Everybody will hear that Jesus is
[1:00:58] alive. But only few
[1:01:00] people will have the
[1:01:03] revelation of the meaning of
[1:01:06] resurrection. You have to have that
[1:01:09] revelation. These two people on the road
[1:01:11] to
[1:01:13] Emmas said that Jesus was talking to
[1:01:16] them along the
[1:01:17] way. And when they were walking with
[1:01:20] Jesus, Jesus was only preaching to them.
[1:01:24] Amen. It was only the
[1:01:26] word explaining to them what has
[1:01:29] happened to the present
[1:01:32] time. He came to the evening time.
[1:01:36] There is something that happens in the
[1:01:38] evening
[1:01:39] time. No wonder God was coming down in
[1:01:42] the cool of the
[1:01:44] day with Adam and
[1:01:46] Eve. It was in the evening time. But the
[1:01:50] evening time is a time of fellowship.
[1:01:54] is a time of
[1:01:56] communion. God explains himself to his
[1:02:00] people. They were walking. The evening
[1:02:04] came and the Bible said that those
[1:02:06] people begged Jesus to stay with
[1:02:10] him. Jesus was about to leave. Amen.
[1:02:13] After preaching them the
[1:02:15] word, it's my time to go. But they
[1:02:19] begged Jesus said, "Master, would you
[1:02:22] stay with us?
[1:02:24] share bread with
[1:02:25] us. Share this communion with us. Amen.
[1:02:29] The
[1:02:30] bread is the opening of the word. Amen.
[1:02:34] Is the revelation. Amen. So when Jesus
[1:02:36] got there, amen. The Bible said that
[1:02:39] Jesus broke
[1:02:41] communion. Amen. During the day, it was
[1:02:45] just the
[1:02:46] word preaching them. Amen. But when the
[1:02:49] evening
[1:02:51] time, Jesus had to show
[1:02:53] them, the same Jesus who walked with
[1:02:57] them is now resurrected. Amen. And he's
[1:03:00] the same
[1:03:02] yesterday. And if we believe that we are
[1:03:04] in the evening
[1:03:06] time, we have to believe that the same
[1:03:10] Jesus women who was with them who said
[1:03:14] that peace be
[1:03:15] still the same Jesus who got to Lazarus
[1:03:20] to come for the same Jesus who saw the
[1:03:25] blind
[1:03:26] body I give you back your
[1:03:29] life. We have to believe the same
[1:03:33] yesterday, today,
[1:03:34] and if he did the same thing, be able to
[1:03:38] do it
[1:03:40] now. That all
[1:03:44] power has been given to me. All power
[1:03:49] has been given to me. And so I the Lord
[1:03:53] Jesus sending you to the
[1:03:58] world. Amen. Teach the
[1:04:01] gospel them. Amen. In the name of the
[1:04:04] Holy Spirit in the name of the Lord
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ. Amen. I the Lord
[1:04:08] Jesus sending you. Amen. And when Jesus
[1:04:11] sends us, it's not
[1:04:14] empty-handed. Amen. He told his
[1:04:16] disciple,
[1:04:17] go to every
[1:04:19] door, knock.
[1:04:21] those who receive you may leave your
[1:04:23] blessing with you.
[1:04:25] So when Jesus said that all power has
[1:04:27] been given to
[1:04:29] you, so now I'm sending you go
[1:04:34] therefore. Amen. He's also sending you
[1:04:37] with the same power. Amen. The same
[1:04:40] power that quickened Jesus from the
[1:04:42] dead. The same power living in us and
[1:04:46] he's sending us all power. The prophet
[1:04:49] says here in adoption,
[1:04:52] this is one of my favorite quotes.
[1:04:54] He says that and if and then if God
[1:04:58] has sent us to be his
[1:05:00] ambassadors ambassador. Amen. If God has
[1:05:03] sent us to be his ambassadors,
[1:05:06] all power that's in
[1:05:08] heaven. Amen. All that God
[1:05:11] is. Amen. All power that's in heaven.
[1:05:15] Amen. Not just some power. Amen. Not
[1:05:18] just a little bit and not just half of
[1:05:22] God. But the prophet says that if God
[1:05:26] has sent us to be his
[1:05:28] ambassador ambassador, he's a
[1:05:31] representative. He represents somebody
[1:05:34] higher than
[1:05:35] him. So Jesus in Matthew 28 says all
[1:05:39] power has been given to me. The prophet
[1:05:42] says that if God has sent us to be his
[1:05:46] ambassadors, the power
[1:05:48] that's in heaven. All that God is,
[1:05:52] all of his angels,
[1:05:55] and all of his power,
[1:05:57] he said that stands
[1:06:00] behind our
[1:06:02] words. Amen. All that God is, all the
[1:06:07] heaven, even the
[1:06:09] angels, they all stand before behind our
[1:06:12] work. Emit because you are an
[1:06:14] ambassador.
[1:06:16] Because God is sending
[1:06:18] you therefore and teach the gospel. He's
[1:06:23] sending you with the
[1:06:24] power, the power of his resurrection.
[1:06:28] Amen. So if we believe that God is
[1:06:29] raised up from the dead, Amen. If we
[1:06:32] believe that God is different than
[1:06:34] Buddha, Amen. If we believe that our God
[1:06:36] is different than
[1:06:38] Muhammad, if we believe that our God is
[1:06:40] different than all the people that
[1:06:42] proclaim to be God, it's just not just
[1:06:45] the simple
[1:06:46] words. But we have to see it. Amen. The
[1:06:49] evidence of his
[1:06:51] resurrection, the evidence of his
[1:06:53] resurrection.
[1:06:57] Amen. He says that is God has to honor
[1:07:00] the
[1:07:01] word. Amen. For he has solemnly written
[1:07:06] that whatever you bind on
[1:07:08] earth that will not bind in
[1:07:10] heaven. Whatever you lose on earth that
[1:07:14] will not lose in heaven. And I give unto
[1:07:18] thee the keys to the
[1:07:20] kingdom. Amen. I give you the keys to
[1:07:23] the
[1:07:24] kingdom. Amen. He's giving you the
[1:07:27] ability. Amen. To do the same thing he
[1:07:30] did when he was
[1:07:31] alive. Amen. is giving you the ability,
[1:07:35] amen, to accomplish the same thing that
[1:07:37] he did. Amen. Now, but but we have
[1:07:41] Christians, amen, that are afraid, Amen.
[1:07:44] to use that
[1:07:46] power. Amen. Christians are afraid.
[1:07:49] Amen. To tap into that power. Amen. To
[1:07:52] tap into that
[1:07:54] connection. Amen. Brother Brooks talked
[1:07:57] about
[1:07:57] something. Amen. About the mental that
[1:08:01] Elijah Amen. Elisha.
[1:08:03] Amen. Elijah had a mantle
[1:08:06] and Elisha had to take care had to take
[1:08:08] had to wear that mantle.
[1:08:11] But you know what happened before Elisha
[1:08:13] did
[1:08:14] that? God had to prepare
[1:08:17] Elisha. Amen. So that Elisha fits the
[1:08:21] mentor. Amen. Not the other way
[1:08:23] around. Amen. Not so that the mentor may
[1:08:26] fit Elijah.
[1:08:29] So that Elijah fits the mantle. Amen.
[1:08:33] God gave the
[1:08:34] promises. Amen. Joel chapter 2. Amen.
[1:08:37] Speaks about the Holy Spirit. Amen. But
[1:08:40] God had to prepare his people. Amen. So
[1:08:43] that they can be able to feit that
[1:08:46] men. That's the purpose of resurrection.
[1:08:49] Amen. That is the purpose why Jesus was
[1:08:52] dead. Amen. And he rose up again. Amen.
[1:08:56] So that we can have access. So that we
[1:08:59] can wear that mental. Amen. God did not
[1:09:01] have to fix the mental. The mental was
[1:09:04] already shaped. Amen. The mental was
[1:09:07] already formed. The mentor had some
[1:09:10] requirements that believers. Amen. We
[1:09:14] had to prepare
[1:09:15] ourselves. Amen. To fit that
[1:09:18] mentor. That is why he died on the
[1:09:20] cross. That is why he said everything is
[1:09:23] fulfilled. Amen. Without his
[1:09:25] resurrection.
[1:09:27] Amen. the Holy Spirit wouldn't come.
[1:09:30] Amen. Without him being dead. Amen.
[1:09:33] Receive the Holy Spirit. Amen. But we
[1:09:36] thank God for the resurrection. Amen. We
[1:09:38] thank God for Easter. Amen. We thank God
[1:09:42] for dying on a
[1:09:43] cross. People cry when they hear about
[1:09:47] that sad. Amen. But I rejoice. Amen.
[1:09:51] Because it's not a sad day. I don't want
[1:09:54] to be like Cleop with his friend.
[1:09:57] Amen. Jesus
[1:10:00] died that
[1:10:03] happened. Amen. He's the day that I was
[1:10:05] set
[1:10:06] free. The day he said that you are free
[1:10:10] indeed. Every shackles that was binding
[1:10:13] you. Everything that was binding you
[1:10:17] because of Jesus being dead, because of
[1:10:20] Jesus being
[1:10:21] resurrected, you can go
[1:10:24] free you.
[1:10:26] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:10:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:47] Amen.
[1:10:49] Mercy
[1:10:50] rewrote my life.
[1:10:55] Oh, God's
[1:10:58] mercy
[1:11:00] rewrote my
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:05] life. I should have fallen, my
[1:11:11] soul cast
[1:11:13] down, but
[1:11:16] mercy
[1:11:18] rewrote my life.
[1:11:23] Oh God's
[1:11:26] mercy
[1:11:27] rewrote my
[1:11:31] life. Oh God's
[1:11:36] mercy
[1:11:37] rewrote my life.
[1:11:43] Oh, cuz I should have
[1:11:47] fallen. My
[1:11:49] soul cast
[1:11:52] down. But
[1:11:55] mercy
[1:11:57] rules my
[1:12:01] life.
[1:12:03] Oh
[1:12:05] mercy
[1:12:07] rules my life.
[1:12:13] Oh
[1:12:15] mercy rewrote my life.
[1:12:22] Oh, cuz I should have
[1:12:27] fallen. My
[1:12:29] soul cast
[1:12:32] down. But
[1:12:34] mercy, glory walonjour.
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:46] Good morning everybody.
[1:12:49] I hope you're doing good.
[1:12:52] I'm very happy to be
[1:12:56] here. I see many friends working at me
[1:12:58] and I'm very
[1:13:00] happy. May the Lord bless us all.
[1:13:04] I wasn't
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:07] ready. But a soldier is always
[1:13:11] ready. If you're a
[1:13:13] soldier, anytime the the war can
[1:13:17] come, if you say that there's no war,
[1:13:21] When the enemy comes, he's not going to
[1:13:22] warn you. Amen.
[1:13:26] If you are a
[1:13:28] fighter, you're always ready for the
[1:13:32] war because at any time the enemy can
[1:13:34] show
[1:13:35] up. You cannot say that I wasn't
[1:13:38] ready. So, you have to be ready for the
[1:13:41] battle. I was sitting there and I I
[1:13:45] heard a good message that was
[1:13:46] preached. I'm very happy.
[1:13:51] I like the way you respond to the word
[1:13:53] and that's wonderful. It was
[1:13:57] wonderful and I'm very
[1:13:59] happy to speak in this audi
[1:14:02] auditorium the auditorium of people
[1:14:04] ready to listen to the
[1:14:07] word without taking too much time let's
[1:14:10] stand and read something in the
[1:14:15] Bible we read John 3:1 16
[1:14:19] to18 all right I'm going to read in
[1:14:21] English for God John 36 16-18 For God so
[1:14:26] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:14:28] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:14:31] him should not perish but have
[1:14:33] everlasting life. For God sent not his
[1:14:37] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:14:40] but that he but the world through him
[1:14:42] might be saved. He that believeth on him
[1:14:45] is not condemned, but he that believeth
[1:14:48] not in is condemned already because he
[1:14:51] has not believed in the name of the only
[1:14:54] begotten son of God. Amen. Amen. We'll
[1:14:58] pray. Lord Jesus, thank you very
[1:15:02] much. We're here to celebrate your love.
[1:15:06] We're here to celebrate your
[1:15:07] resurrection.
[1:15:09] [Music]
[1:15:11] There is no greater thing than giving
[1:15:13] his life for
[1:15:14] his what you
[1:15:16] did. Somebody else could couldn't do
[1:15:20] it. When John was
[1:15:22] crying because nobody was
[1:15:26] worthy, but you came and you took up the
[1:15:29] challenge. Today we're singing your
[1:15:31] love because you gave
[1:15:34] us condemnation and sin that was
[1:15:37] weighing on us.
[1:15:39] You won it for us. And today we're
[1:15:42] singing victory. We're singing love,
[1:15:45] singing peace and
[1:15:46] healing because of your
[1:15:48] love. May you be with us during this
[1:15:52] little time that we spend here.
[1:15:55] May you bless us from the beginning in
[1:15:57] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:00] We may be seated.
[1:16:05] We're here to celebrate love.
[1:16:10] and the true love of
[1:16:14] God. We're here to celebrate the true
[1:16:16] love of
[1:16:19] God. A love that is different than other
[1:16:23] loves. Because as men, we don't know how
[1:16:26] to
[1:16:28] love. We love people that look like
[1:16:32] us. We love people for from our race.
[1:16:37] We love people from our
[1:16:38] village, people who talk like
[1:16:42] us, people who look like us. Those are
[1:16:44] people that love us. But that is that is
[1:16:47] hypocrisy. It's not
[1:16:50] love because we love until we
[1:16:53] offended. We say that we
[1:16:55] love. We love and we
[1:16:57] love because the person that we love has
[1:17:00] not offended us yet. But once we
[1:17:04] all as the same the same person was
[1:17:06] saying that we love them we change our
[1:17:09] language. No, you see
[1:17:11] them. But before then, we were saying
[1:17:14] that we loved
[1:17:15] them. That's not
[1:17:19] love. Love that was what Sean and Golgo.
[1:17:22] That was true
[1:17:24] love of a holy God, a pure
[1:17:28] God who gave himself for somebody who's
[1:17:31] worth nothing. A true God, a good
[1:17:35] God, who loved you because you're not
[1:17:37] from his race. Beloved, he's holy and
[1:17:40] you're a
[1:17:41] sinner. He loves you without them doing
[1:17:44] anything. He doesn't love you because
[1:17:46] you have something so that you can give
[1:17:49] him his in return. But he loves you
[1:17:52] without any
[1:17:54] reason. He loves you because he wants to
[1:17:56] save
[1:17:58] you. You have nothing to give him back.
[1:18:01] But he loves you
[1:18:03] anyhow. But we don't know how to
[1:18:06] love. That's why we don't love
[1:18:08] God. It's God who loved us before the
[1:18:11] foundation of the
[1:18:13] world. He loved us before the foundation
[1:18:16] of the
[1:18:17] world. He was before that we came to
[1:18:20] this
[1:18:21] earth. Before that we've done
[1:18:23] anything. He accomplished everything for
[1:18:26] us. We are here to celebrate that love.
[1:18:32] Easter is a celebration of love.
[1:18:36] Seeing that divine love,
[1:18:39] God left his throne.
[1:18:41] He came down to die for us.
[1:18:45] Today, there's a big problem in the
[1:18:47] world. The problem, the world is lacking
[1:18:50] love. Everybody's complaining about
[1:18:52] love. There is no love. There's no
[1:18:56] love. But where will the love come
[1:18:59] from? Now kick down kicked out the
[1:19:03] master of love. The master he's outside
[1:19:06] of the
[1:19:09] decision. But how can you have love
[1:19:11] without the giver of
[1:19:13] love? You shouldn't have. You're not
[1:19:16] supposed to ch to kick out the the giver
[1:19:19] if you need the
[1:19:21] gift. You have to invite the
[1:19:24] giver. You're not supposed to kick him
[1:19:27] outside and hoping to have love. It's
[1:19:30] not possible.
[1:19:32] That's the first reason why people don't
[1:19:34] have love today. And the second
[1:19:37] reason is that
[1:19:40] everybody everybody wants to be
[1:19:43] loved. Everybody wants to be loved.
[1:19:46] Amen. There is complaining everywhere
[1:19:49] especially in our in our family. If
[1:19:51] people saying that I don't I'm not
[1:19:53] loved. Amen. The husband says that my my
[1:19:55] wife doesn't love me. The wife says that
[1:19:58] my husband doesn't love me. Everybody
[1:20:00] wants to be loved. But before being
[1:20:03] loved,
[1:20:04] you have to love first. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:10] You cannot claim what you cannot
[1:20:13] give. You love
[1:20:18] first. Because
[1:20:21] uh Amen. Right works together with uh
[1:20:25] the duties. Thank
[1:20:27] you. Amen. Love works with
[1:20:30] duties. If you wants to be
[1:20:33] loved, love
[1:20:36] first. Start by
[1:20:39] loving. If you are reclaiming love, it's
[1:20:42] good. It's your duty. It's your It's
[1:20:45] your duty. It's your
[1:20:46] right. But you have to love
[1:20:52] first. Amen. Amen. Project your love.
[1:20:58] Amen. Love has a condition.
[1:21:02] If you love, you have to give. Amen.
[1:21:04] Amen.
[1:21:07] Because God has so loved the
[1:21:09] world, he didn't cross his
[1:21:12] hands. When God has so loved the
[1:21:15] world, he
[1:21:17] gave. When he finished, he gave. When he
[1:21:21] finished loving, he gave. When you say,
[1:21:24] "I love, I love, I love.
[1:21:26] But love is
[1:21:28] invisible. Love is
[1:21:30] invisible. We're not seeing love.
[1:21:34] If you love, you have to prove that you
[1:21:36] love.
[1:21:38] If you love, you have to
[1:21:40] give. When God has so loved the world,
[1:21:44] he did not cross his
[1:21:45] hands. He loved and he gave.
[1:21:49] And you also when you love, you have to
[1:21:51] give. God also loved the world.
[1:21:56] He gave
[1:21:59] himself so that whosoever will believe
[1:22:01] in him will not die but we receive the
[1:22:05] whole eternal
[1:22:08] life. Giving is a part of our
[1:22:13] religion. Amen. There is a greater
[1:22:15] reward in giving than
[1:22:17] receiving. When you give, you are
[1:22:19] blessed.
[1:22:22] Don't complain because of lack of love.
[1:22:25] Because
[1:22:27] generally people see
[1:22:29] mistakes. It's a lack of love that's
[1:22:32] doing. Amen. You always see mistakes
[1:22:35] from somebody
[1:22:36] else. Amen. I read something from the
[1:22:39] social media, social media. I read
[1:22:43] something. There is a woman who was
[1:22:45] complaining about about her
[1:22:48] neighbor. when her neighbor will uh dry
[1:22:51] up her
[1:22:52] clothes. Amen. She will see through the
[1:22:56] window and she'll say that her neighbor
[1:22:59] doesn't know how to wash clothes because
[1:23:01] her clothes were dirty all the
[1:23:04] time. But that wasn't the true
[1:23:08] problem. The problem was she was a dirty
[1:23:10] one and she did not clean the
[1:23:14] window. And when she was looking through
[1:23:17] the window, she was seeing the dirtiness
[1:23:20] of somebody else. Well, the problem was
[1:23:22] him
[1:23:23] herself. Amen. Fix your heart
[1:23:26] first. Love
[1:23:28] first. Start by
[1:23:31] loving. Don't claim the
[1:23:34] rights, but do your duties
[1:23:38] first. This generation will be
[1:23:42] healed. Amen. What we're missing is the
[1:23:46] love divorce that we have is because of
[1:23:49] lack of love and love that
[1:23:52] is amen. That was what was manifested in
[1:23:56] Gusta. We are in this
[1:23:58] world in a
[1:24:01] battle. Amen. In the battle in the
[1:24:05] battlefield. Amen. We we fight every day
[1:24:08] and every
[1:24:09] night. And to
[1:24:12] win. Amen. And to receive any victories,
[1:24:16] you must have love. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:22] Today we're happy about the message. For
[1:24:24] the
[1:24:25] message, today we happy for the
[1:24:29] resurrection. Today we love the Bible.
[1:24:31] We're happy about it.
[1:24:35] But where these things came
[1:24:38] from? It came because God so loved the
[1:24:42] world. It's in love that we get our
[1:24:46] victories. The the victories on on our
[1:24:50] enemies came to us through
[1:24:53] death. When Jesus accepted dying, then
[1:24:56] we that's when we received those
[1:24:58] victories. Peter did not understand it.
[1:25:02] Peter wanted to
[1:25:03] fight, wanted to defend Jesus.
[1:25:07] He took out his sword to attack the
[1:25:11] soldiers. Jesus did not allow
[1:25:14] it because he knew that at the
[1:25:18] end that of the terrible thing that was
[1:25:21] making us afraid, it will come out
[1:25:26] honey. That's the miracle that God gave
[1:25:29] us from death.
[1:25:32] God gave us
[1:25:33] life and in the name of that love that
[1:25:37] we can sing his
[1:25:41] victory can let us know about the
[1:25:46] time. Okay. Okay.
[1:25:50] Okay. I wanted to
[1:25:54] check. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1:26:02] So there is no way to do anything
[1:26:04] without
[1:26:05] love. Now another
[1:26:09] thing everywhere we can we can miss
[1:26:11] love. It's it's it's good. But not here.
[1:26:15] Not
[1:26:17] here. We we we not supposed to love.
[1:26:21] We're not supposed to be missing love
[1:26:23] here because this is our sign. Our
[1:26:27] token. We will be known by our loves. By
[1:26:30] our loves. It's our sign, our
[1:26:34] token. It's our token that we have to
[1:26:36] bring
[1:26:37] everywhere. Jesus says, "Love one
[1:26:41] another so that the world will know that
[1:26:43] you belong to
[1:26:44] me." That's what happened
[1:26:47] in any people were living in
[1:26:50] love. They were loved by God.
[1:26:54] They were loved but they loved everybody
[1:26:57] else and people looked at them.
[1:27:01] They said that truly they were with
[1:27:03] Christ. Love is our
[1:27:05] sign. I was saying that it's a
[1:27:11] victory through love that we can receive
[1:27:14] that victory. If we can read
[1:27:19] some in the divine love of
[1:27:23] 56 paragraph
[1:27:41] 96 divine love 56 paragraph
[1:27:44] Paragraph is paragraph 96.
[1:27:52] Uh all right. In the message divine love
[1:27:54] uh of 1956 paragraph 96 the prophet says
[1:27:57] that and I and I only know one thing.
[1:28:02] Here it is. I want you to hear it. There
[1:28:05] is only one thing that will conquer the
[1:28:07] devil. That is pure divine love. Amen.
[1:28:12] Love will conquer everything. God so
[1:28:15] loved the world, he conquered the sin
[1:28:18] question. He conquered the sickness
[1:28:20] question. It It'll conquer the
[1:28:23] difference in the church. It'll conquer
[1:28:25] everything that there is unlike it to be
[1:28:30] conquered. It'll do it if you just let
[1:28:32] it do it. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:39] If you want to have victory,
[1:28:44] though it is a great
[1:28:46] victory or a small
[1:28:49] victory, the only way to conquer is
[1:28:53] through
[1:28:55] love. Many people has
[1:28:58] conquered in the history of
[1:29:01] overcoming. There are so many people we
[1:29:03] can name names.
[1:29:06] But today the victories have been
[1:29:09] forgotten. The only victory of Jesus is
[1:29:12] still
[1:29:15] here because he conquered through
[1:29:19] love because he overcame through
[1:29:23] love. Anything else that happened
[1:29:25] because of
[1:29:26] hatred show their
[1:29:29] limits. Again we say glory to God. We do
[1:29:33] thank you Lord for the
[1:29:35] resurrection. We say thank you Lord for
[1:29:38] Easter. Jesus is
[1:29:41] resurrected. It's a sign of love. When
[1:29:44] he
[1:29:45] died, he took our sins with him. When he
[1:29:50] resurrected, Amen. He He ruptured us in
[1:29:53] the heavenly places in Jesus Christ. May
[1:29:56] God be be worshiped for his love. Amen.
[1:29:58] Amen.
[1:30:01] Amen. Amen. Let's sing. What a what a
[1:30:05] mighty God we
[1:30:07] serve. Oh, what a mighty God we
[1:30:12] serve. The angel bow before him. Heaven
[1:30:16] and earth adore him. What a mighty God
[1:30:20] we
[1:30:21] serve. Oh, what a mighty God we
[1:30:26] serve. Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:30:32] The angels bow before him. Heaven and
[1:30:36] earth. Oh, what a mighty God we
[1:30:40] serve. Oh, I will enter his gates with
[1:30:44] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter
[1:30:47] his courts with
[1:30:49] praise. I will say this is the day that
[1:30:53] the Lord has made. I will rejoice for he
[1:30:57] has made me glad.
[1:31:00] Oh, he has made me glad. He has made me
[1:31:04] glad. I praise God for he has made me
[1:31:09] glad. Oh, he has made me glad. Oh, he
[1:31:13] has made me glad. I will rejoice for he
[1:31:16] has made me glad.
[1:31:20] Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] Hallelujah. Amen. Let us just open our
[1:31:23] Bibles to the book of Luke and chapter
[1:31:25] 4. Luke Luke chapter 4 and verse 17.
[1:31:31] The Bible reads, "And there was
[1:31:33] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:31:35] prophet
[1:31:37] Isaiah, and when he had opened the
[1:31:41] book, he found the place where it was
[1:31:43] written,
[1:31:46] the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:31:49] me, because he has anointed me to preach
[1:31:52] the gospel to the poor.
[1:31:57] He has sent me to heal the
[1:32:00] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:32:03] the captives,
[1:32:05] and recovering of sight to the
[1:32:09] blind, to set at liberty them that are
[1:32:14] bruised, and to preach the acceptable
[1:32:16] year of the Lord.
[1:32:20] Amen. We may take our seats. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:24] In the uh scripture we just
[1:32:27] read, Jesus was given the scroll.
[1:32:31] They had a custom of handing the uh a
[1:32:35] few people to read the
[1:32:39] scroll and when he was given he just
[1:32:42] wrote to the scripture that pertain to
[1:32:46] him and he started proclaiming his
[1:32:50] ministry. He started proclaiming why he
[1:32:53] had come on
[1:32:56] earth. Amen. And he started telling them
[1:32:58] why he had
[1:33:01] come and describing the people he had
[1:33:04] come
[1:33:05] for. He says, "I have come to heal the
[1:33:11] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:33:13] the
[1:33:16] captives and recovering of sight to the
[1:33:19] blind.
[1:33:22] and liberty to them that are bruised.
[1:33:26] So I'm just going to speak on he came
[1:33:28] for me.
[1:33:30] Just turn to your neighbor and say he
[1:33:32] came for
[1:33:33] me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He did not
[1:33:36] come for the
[1:33:37] Pharisees. He did not come for the
[1:33:39] people who
[1:33:41] were. But he came for those who were
[1:33:45] broken. He came for those who were
[1:33:48] bruised. If you have ever been broken
[1:33:52] before, he came for you. If you have
[1:33:55] ever been bruised
[1:33:57] before, he came for
[1:33:59] you. If you have ever been sick
[1:34:03] before, he came for you. Amen. That's
[1:34:06] the whole essence of
[1:34:09] Easter. That was the mission he came on
[1:34:13] earth. Hallelujah. when he was walking
[1:34:16] on the shores of
[1:34:17] God, when he was walking on those
[1:34:19] streets of
[1:34:21] Jerusalem, he was accomplishing his
[1:34:24] ministry. He was accomplishing his
[1:34:27] mission. He saw Mary Magdalene
[1:34:32] suffering. It shows those
[1:34:34] demons. Amen. No demon could
[1:34:37] stop. When the master
[1:34:40] spoke, the demon had to leave. A
[1:34:43] thousand demons could not stand before
[1:34:46] him because the scripture says he has
[1:34:49] been
[1:34:50] anointed for those who are
[1:34:52] brokenhearted.
[1:34:54] So he just did not come without no
[1:34:57] anointing. But he was anointed to come
[1:35:00] and rescue
[1:35:02] you. And we know Jesus was a perfect
[1:35:05] man.
[1:35:07] He never left without completing his
[1:35:10] mission.
[1:35:13] Hallelujah.
[1:35:14] In John uh John
[1:35:18] 17:12, Jesus prayed for you.
[1:35:22] He prayed for me. And there are other
[1:35:24] prayers that could never be
[1:35:27] answered. I know this one is
[1:35:29] guaranteed. Hallelujah. He says, "While
[1:35:32] I was with them in the world,
[1:35:35] while I was with them in the world, I
[1:35:37] kept them in my name, in thy name.
[1:35:46] which those thou gavest
[1:35:49] me I
[1:35:51] kept and none of them is lost.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So brother,
[1:35:57] sister, you can never be
[1:35:59] lost. Why? Because he came for you. It
[1:36:03] doesn't matter what you were going
[1:36:04] through. It doesn't matter what your
[1:36:06] past is like. He came for you.
[1:36:10] And you can never ever be lost
[1:36:14] because Jesus prayed for
[1:36:16] you. You might not trust your
[1:36:18] prayer, but I'm telling you, trust
[1:36:20] Jesus's
[1:36:22] prayer. He has never ever
[1:36:24] failed. My Bible tells me he's not a man
[1:36:27] that he should
[1:36:28] lie, nor a son of man that he should
[1:36:31] repent. When he speaks a word, that word
[1:36:35] does not go back to him void.
[1:36:37] So when he prays for you that you can
[1:36:39] never be lost, it doesn't matter what
[1:36:41] obstacles Satan put in your
[1:36:43] life, you can never ever be
[1:36:46] lost. That's why he came to die on the
[1:36:48] cross of
[1:36:49] Jesus. That's why we are commemorating
[1:36:53] this when he went on that
[1:36:55] cross. He came for you. Turn to your
[1:36:58] neighbor say he came to
[1:37:00] you. He came for you. Hallelujah.
[1:37:04] Hallelujah. And he was the ultimate
[1:37:05] sacrifice.
[1:37:07] that was paid for you and me. It was
[1:37:10] paid for your sins. It was paid for your
[1:37:14] iniquities. Your iniquities is your sins
[1:37:16] that you are going to
[1:37:18] commit. He was already sacrificed for
[1:37:22] that. The blood of bulls and goats could
[1:37:24] not erase your
[1:37:26] sins, but the blood of Christ will erase
[1:37:29] them and wipe your
[1:37:31] snake. Hallelujah. How many are glad for
[1:37:34] amazing grace? Amen.
[1:37:38] So in the Old
[1:37:39] Testament when someone brought a
[1:37:43] sacrifice, the
[1:37:45] priest did not examine the person who
[1:37:47] brought the sacrifice.
[1:37:50] The priest examined the
[1:37:53] lamb. So when they were bringing the
[1:37:55] lamb to the
[1:37:57] sacrifice, they had to make sure that
[1:37:59] lamb is
[1:38:01] perfect. It does not have any blemish.
[1:38:04] It doesn't have any spot or wrinkle.
[1:38:09] And when the priest was about to
[1:38:11] sacrifice
[1:38:12] him, it doesn't matter how many sins
[1:38:15] they
[1:38:16] had. He didn't look at the at the son of
[1:38:19] God. He looked at the lamb and because
[1:38:23] the lamb was
[1:38:24] perfect, he says, "Your sins are
[1:38:26] forgiven."
[1:38:28] But because it was the blood of booze
[1:38:29] and
[1:38:30] goss, they kept on coming over and over
[1:38:33] again.
[1:38:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But there had to
[1:38:37] come an end to all of that. And God came
[1:38:40] in the body of his own
[1:38:43] son, the ultimate
[1:38:46] sacrifice so that he could wipe away
[1:38:48] your
[1:38:49] sins once and for all.
[1:38:52] Let's hear what the prophet of God says.
[1:38:55] He says, "That's the way it is today.
[1:38:58] We guilty and
[1:39:00] worthy should die. We are not worthy of
[1:39:04] leaving.
[1:39:06] We are not worthy to come to Christ.
[1:39:09] We are not worthy to ask
[1:39:12] anything. God never looks at your
[1:39:16] unworthiness. He looked at the
[1:39:19] lamb. Now he can find no fault in
[1:39:23] Christ. Then you are free. When Jesus
[1:39:26] was on the
[1:39:27] earth, he was
[1:39:30] sinfree. He was the only perfect man who
[1:39:32] never committed a
[1:39:34] sin yet to be the perfect lamb.
[1:39:38] Pilot examined him. He says, "I find no
[1:39:41] fault in
[1:39:42] him." Why? He was being examined for
[1:39:45] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He died in
[1:39:49] yourstead and now there is no fault with
[1:39:52] him. You are not free
[1:39:54] yet. But God don't examine
[1:39:57] you. He examines the
[1:40:00] lamb. You say, "I'm not worthy to walk
[1:40:02] out of this
[1:40:05] wheelchair." That's right. You are
[1:40:09] not going to examine
[1:40:11] you. He examine Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] Hallelujah. And if he is worthy,
[1:40:18] then you can walk. Hallelujah.
[1:40:21] Hallelujah. So you might not be in a
[1:40:23] wheelchair wherever you are
[1:40:26] here examine yourself in the
[1:40:30] mirror because God is not looking at
[1:40:32] you. He's not looking at the lies you
[1:40:36] told. He's not looking at what you stole
[1:40:38] 5 years
[1:40:40] ago. He's looking at
[1:40:42] Christ. And when he sees Christ, Christ
[1:40:46] is
[1:40:47] blameless and he says you can go free
[1:40:50] because you never done it in the first
[1:40:52] place.
[1:40:54] Devil the accuser of
[1:40:55] brethren, he cannot accuse
[1:40:58] you because you are free because you are
[1:41:02] blameless. God does not look at you. He
[1:41:06] looks at Christ. So because he looks at
[1:41:08] Christ, I know I'm free. But that was
[1:41:12] not the end of the
[1:41:13] story when they buried him on
[1:41:17] Friday. They thought he was dead and
[1:41:19] gone.
[1:41:21] But that was just the beginning of the
[1:41:24] story when he cried on the cross and
[1:41:26] said it is
[1:41:28] finished. He was talking about the
[1:41:30] prophecies that talked about till his
[1:41:33] death. But he was not done
[1:41:37] yet. After he
[1:41:39] died, he went down to gra in the
[1:41:42] grave. When he was in the grave,
[1:41:45] everything seemed
[1:41:48] silent. Was
[1:41:50] gone. But when it was
[1:41:53] silent, that's when he was
[1:41:56] working. That's why the singer said,
[1:41:59] "Even if I don't see it,
[1:42:01] you are
[1:42:03] working. He's a way maker. He's a
[1:42:06] miracle worker.
[1:42:08] He works in the silence
[1:42:11] on
[1:42:12] Saturday when the earth was
[1:42:14] confused and crying, "Our savior is
[1:42:18] gone." He had one stop to
[1:42:21] make and he went down to the region of
[1:42:23] the
[1:42:24] lost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he
[1:42:26] came to the door of
[1:42:28] hell. And he started
[1:42:30] knocking. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:42:33] when the demons came, they saw it was
[1:42:36] Jesus and they all started
[1:42:38] trembling. You see what the prophet
[1:42:40] says, "Amen." Amen. He says, "Now I can
[1:42:43] hear him saying,
[1:42:46] Satan, come here. He is boss now." And
[1:42:50] he reaches over and grabs the key of
[1:42:54] death, hell, and the grave.
[1:42:57] He took away the key from Satan.
[1:43:01] the key of death, hell, and the
[1:43:04] grave. Satan cannot kill
[1:43:06] you. Satan cannot send you to
[1:43:09] hell. He took those
[1:43:14] keys. And Jesus said to Satan, I want to
[1:43:17] serve you. Notice on
[1:43:20] you. You've been a bluff long enough.
[1:43:26] I'm the virgin born son of the living
[1:43:28] God.
[1:43:30] My blood is still wet on the cross.
[1:43:34] My blood is still wet on the
[1:43:36] cross and the full debt has been
[1:43:39] paid. Not partially but
[1:43:43] fully. You have no rights no
[1:43:46] more. Satan have no rights no more. He
[1:43:49] has no rights over your life. He has no
[1:43:52] rights over your family.
[1:43:54] He has no right over your
[1:43:56] finances because his right has been
[1:43:58] taken
[1:43:59] away. You are stripped.
[1:44:03] Give me those keys.
[1:44:05] Amen.
[1:44:07] That's right. He turns around and gives
[1:44:10] him a good healthy
[1:44:13] kick and slams the door
[1:44:16] together and says, "Stay in there. I'm
[1:44:19] boss from now
[1:44:21] on." Satan was closed down in hell.
[1:44:24] He no longer has power over you.
[1:44:28] When brother Isaac was preaching, he
[1:44:30] says, "All power that is in
[1:44:32] heaven was given to Jesus." And we know
[1:44:35] that all that was in
[1:44:37] God was poured into
[1:44:39] Christ and all that was in Christ was
[1:44:43] poured into
[1:44:44] you. The power that God
[1:44:46] had, he says, "Let there
[1:44:49] be the same power that Jesus had. when
[1:44:53] he kicked
[1:44:55] Satan. I'm here to remind you the same
[1:44:58] power that Jesus
[1:44:59] has laying in you this morning. So if
[1:45:03] Jesus could kick Satan with that
[1:45:07] power
[1:45:09] too, he cannot stand before you. He's
[1:45:12] been stripped naked.
[1:45:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'll finish off
[1:45:19] with this quote.
[1:45:22] Amen. Amen. And the prophet God says, I
[1:45:26] think of him when he had risen from the
[1:45:29] dead that morning
[1:45:32] that um he was had his own blood as as a
[1:45:36] high priest.
[1:45:40] He was sacrificing his blood as his own
[1:45:43] blood as the high priest.
[1:45:46] This was after the cross of
[1:45:49] Calvary and he took his blood and he was
[1:45:52] going for to atone for you and
[1:45:54] me. He went beyond the veils through
[1:45:57] every
[1:45:58] sin. Now listen, it says Satan in the
[1:46:02] times
[1:46:05] past had men blocked off from heaven.
[1:46:12] Satan in times past had men blocked from
[1:46:16] heaven and men could not go get into
[1:46:19] contact with heaven
[1:46:22] because when Adam lost the title
[1:46:26] deed there was a chasm that was
[1:46:29] created. There was a chasm that was
[1:46:32] created that was created
[1:46:35] and men could not communicate with God.
[1:46:39] Amen. So Satan in times past had men
[1:46:40] blocked offer from
[1:46:43] heaven. A man could not get in contact
[1:46:45] with
[1:46:47] heaven. But when Jesus took his
[1:46:50] blood, the first veil he
[1:46:53] rent was the veil of
[1:46:56] death and the veil of the
[1:47:00] grave. the veil in the temple
[1:47:04] and the veil of sickness
[1:47:08] and the veil of fear
[1:47:10] and every veil that there
[1:47:13] was it was
[1:47:15] rent and God revealed it to
[1:47:18] man. So the blockage that Satan
[1:47:21] had Jesus came to break that
[1:47:26] veil. So he went away in a uh in above
[1:47:29] the heavens of
[1:47:31] heaven and was seated on the right hand
[1:47:34] of God and sit
[1:47:35] down as a finished
[1:47:38] work and all
[1:47:41] above. He opened a channel that God used
[1:47:44] to come down through the corridors of
[1:47:50] heaven and talk to mankind in the garden
[1:47:52] of Eden and
[1:47:55] Satan. And Satan by sin had blocked
[1:48:00] them. But the great high
[1:48:03] priest with his
[1:48:06] anointed with his blood, he went
[1:48:10] through every veil and ripped her open
[1:48:14] out of the
[1:48:15] sky. Amen. Amen. Amen. So before the
[1:48:18] cross of Calvary,
[1:48:20] there was a blockage in heaven because
[1:48:22] of sin.
[1:48:24] Remember Daniel prayed for 21
[1:48:27] days and he was fighting the prince of
[1:48:31] Pasia because there was a blockage.
[1:48:34] But when Jesus
[1:48:35] came, he rent that
[1:48:38] veil. He rent the veil of
[1:48:40] sickness. He rent the veil of
[1:48:43] fear and open up back that communication
[1:48:46] pathway.
[1:48:49] He went through every
[1:48:51] veil and ripped it open and cleared out
[1:48:53] the skies
[1:48:55] again that God and men could be
[1:48:59] father and son and commune again with
[1:49:02] one another.
[1:49:04] So your prayers cannot be blocked
[1:49:07] anymore because there is an open
[1:49:11] channel. There is no death that can
[1:49:13] block you
[1:49:15] because he rent that veil.
[1:49:18] No fear or
[1:49:20] depression that can block you because
[1:49:23] when he
[1:49:25] sacrificed himself,
[1:49:27] you rent it open. You can have full
[1:49:30] access to the throne of God. So you can
[1:49:34] walk
[1:49:35] boldly before the throne of God and you
[1:49:39] ask for whatever you want because he
[1:49:42] opened that
[1:49:43] communication. The power that Adam had,
[1:49:46] he came to restore it back to you. That
[1:49:49] was essence of the cross and Calvary.
[1:49:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He rented for
[1:49:54] you and me.
[1:49:56] Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:50:03] There is power, power, wonder working
[1:50:07] power in the
[1:50:09] blood of the lamb.
[1:50:13] There is power, power, wonder working
[1:50:18] power in the precious blood of the
[1:50:23] lamb. For there is power, power, wonder
[1:50:28] working power in the
[1:50:31] blood of the lamb.
[1:50:35] There is power, power, wonder working
[1:50:40] power in the precious blood of the
[1:50:47] lamb. Power, oh wonder working power in
[1:50:52] the
[1:50:53] blood of the lamb.
[1:50:57] There is power, power, wonder working
[1:51:01] power in the precious blood of the lamb.
[1:51:08] Amen. Amen. You may you may stand.
[1:51:12] And we appreciate God for the word
[1:51:14] that's been spoken this morning.
[1:51:17] I've never done anything like this
[1:51:19] preaching for 15
[1:51:21] minutes and I'm still new into this
[1:51:25] thing, but my hope is in God. You know,
[1:51:28] I trust God because it's not up to me to
[1:51:31] do the talking, but it's up to
[1:51:34] God. And it's not about the quantity of
[1:51:37] the word, but it's about the quality.
[1:51:41] Let's um have a word of prayer real
[1:51:43] quick. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[1:51:47] how good you've been to us, Lord God.
[1:51:50] And I thank you for your love. I thank
[1:51:51] you for the cross, Lord. And more
[1:51:54] importantly, I thank you for raising
[1:51:55] again, Lord Jesus. And heavenly father,
[1:51:58] because you leave, we we we shall leave
[1:52:00] also, Lord Jesus. Heavenly Father, I
[1:52:02] pray that you anoint your word this
[1:52:04] morning. I surrender myself to you. I
[1:52:07] surrender the congregation to
[1:52:10] you in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:52:14] pray. Amen. Amen. Let's go to Luke
[1:52:17] chapter 1 verse 26.
[1:52:27] Luke chapter 1 verse 26 says, "And in
[1:52:30] the sixth month, Luke,
[1:52:34] and in the sixth month, the angel
[1:52:36] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[1:52:38] Galilee named Nazareth."
[1:52:44] So, a virgin is spouse to a man whose
[1:52:46] name was Joseph.
[1:52:48] And yeah, whose name was Joseph of the
[1:52:51] house of David, and the virgin's name
[1:52:53] was Mary.
[1:52:59] So, I'll just keep And so, the angel
[1:53:01] pretty much is telling Mary that she's
[1:53:03] going to bear a son without without
[1:53:05] touching a man.
[1:53:10] And then verse 34, Mary says, "Then then
[1:53:13] said Mary unto the angel, how shall this
[1:53:16] be, seeing I know not a man?"
[1:53:23] You know, Mary understood that this was
[1:53:25] something impossible to be
[1:53:28] done. And then 35, the angel answered
[1:53:31] and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall
[1:53:34] come upon thee, and the power of the
[1:53:36] highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore
[1:53:39] also the holy thing which shall be born
[1:53:40] of thee shall be called the son of God.
[1:53:47] You
[1:53:48] know, you notice the difference when
[1:53:51] something a challenge stood in front of
[1:53:53] Mary something that seemed impossible to
[1:53:55] her. The answer was the Holy Ghost shall
[1:53:57] come upon
[1:54:03] me. And that's going to be my little
[1:54:05] subject for for today. You know, the
[1:54:08] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. In
[1:54:10] other words, the quickening power, the
[1:54:12] quickening spirits will come upon thee.
[1:54:18] And you may have your
[1:54:19] seats. Now let's go to Luke chapter 18
[1:54:23] verse
[1:54:26] 27. Luke chapter 18 verse 27.
[1:54:30] And the Bible says and he said the
[1:54:32] things which are impossible with men are
[1:54:34] possible with God.
[1:54:38] So remember this thing, it was
[1:54:40] impossible for a man, for a woman to
[1:54:42] have a child without touching a
[1:54:47] man. But the difference was that when
[1:54:50] the Holy Spirit comes upon you, it makes
[1:54:52] the
[1:54:55] difference. It's the same thing in our
[1:54:57] lives. Anything that may seem impossible
[1:55:00] to us,
[1:55:02] the answer is that when the Holy Ghost
[1:55:04] shall come upon thee, he will make that
[1:55:06] thing possible.
[1:55:08] Why? Because because the Holy Ghost is
[1:55:11] God
[1:55:12] himself because when the Holy Ghost
[1:55:14] makes a promise, he always has to abide
[1:55:16] by his
[1:55:17] promise because to the Holy Ghost,
[1:55:19] nothing is
[1:55:21] impossible. In the life of a Christian,
[1:55:24] without the Holy Ghost, you are nothing.
[1:55:26] Without the Holy Ghost, you cannot have
[1:55:28] any victories.
[1:55:30] Without the Holy Ghost, you're always
[1:55:31] going to find yourself in a cycle.
[1:55:34] But what you need to do this morning is
[1:55:36] you need to call on God. And and this
[1:55:38] morning, I'm here to tell you that the
[1:55:40] difference is when the Holy Ghost will
[1:55:42] come up on thee, he'll make that thing
[1:55:45] possible. One of the examples, one of
[1:55:47] the examples, Samson, Samson the prophet
[1:55:50] said he was not a strong man in his own
[1:55:52] nature.
[1:55:55] Samson, the prophet even says he was
[1:55:56] like a
[1:55:58] cece. But the difference is that when
[1:56:00] that power came on
[1:56:02] Samson, he made him a stronger
[1:56:06] person. You may find yourself falling in
[1:56:09] sin, day after day you keep falling to
[1:56:11] the same sin. And then that seems seem
[1:56:14] that seems seem seem as if it's too
[1:56:16] strong for
[1:56:18] you. But the answer to that is just let
[1:56:20] the Holy Ghost fall upon you.
[1:56:23] Let that quickening power that was on
[1:56:25] Jesus Christ be in you
[1:56:28] and he'll make you
[1:56:29] victorious. We here celebrating the
[1:56:32] resurrection. What is the resurrection?
[1:56:34] The resurrection. When Jesus rose, he
[1:56:36] had to send a
[1:56:37] token. There had to be proof of the
[1:56:40] resurrection. How do we know that Jesus
[1:56:42] is alive? When when God rose, he said,
[1:56:45] "I send you as witnesses." God has to
[1:56:48] send witnesses of his resurrection.
[1:56:51] And this morning, God is looking for
[1:56:53] witnesses of his
[1:56:55] resurrection. But the only way you can
[1:56:57] be a witness of his resurrection is you.
[1:56:59] The Holy Ghost must be upon
[1:57:02] you.
[1:57:04] Because Jesus says, "I send you to be
[1:57:07] witnesses. But wait, wait for the Holy
[1:57:11] Ghost, that promise of the father to
[1:57:12] come upon you
[1:57:14] first. When the when the Holy Ghost
[1:57:16] comes, he makes a difference in the life
[1:57:18] of a Christian.
[1:57:20] Samson he was in the lowest moment of
[1:57:23] moment of his life.
[1:57:25] He was about to get to be to get killed
[1:57:29] and he did something very
[1:57:30] evil but he remembered that he once used
[1:57:34] to have that quickening power in
[1:57:36] him. He remembered that he wasn't
[1:57:38] himself making himself
[1:57:40] stronger and it seems like everybody was
[1:57:43] against him. All the Philistines,
[1:57:45] everybody that wanted to make an
[1:57:46] entertainment out of Samson.
[1:57:49] This morning you might feel like in you
[1:57:51] alone in your fight.
[1:57:53] You might feel like the demons and
[1:57:55] demons are coming after you and you're
[1:57:57] all alone. But Jesus says that I'll
[1:58:00] never leave you nor forsake you. I'll
[1:58:04] always be with you. But what you need to
[1:58:06] do, you need to do like so you need to
[1:58:08] remember
[1:58:09] God. You need to remember that it's not
[1:58:12] yourself, but it's he that lives in
[1:58:14] you is greater than he that lives of the
[1:58:17] in the world. Any obstacles that comes
[1:58:20] in your life, you have to realize that
[1:58:23] you have a God who is stronger than the
[1:58:24] obstacles.
[1:58:27] That God has never lost the
[1:58:29] battle. Jesus, even when death knocked
[1:58:31] at his door, death had gotten all the
[1:58:34] prophets throughout the
[1:58:36] ages. But this time when death knocked
[1:58:39] at Jesus door, death understood that
[1:58:42] something was different about that man.
[1:58:44] death understood that this person was
[1:58:46] not just didn't just have the quickening
[1:58:48] power, but he was the quickening power.
[1:58:52] And Jesus also knowing that he needed
[1:58:54] that quickening power in order for him
[1:58:56] to
[1:58:58] overcome. That's why he's sending us his
[1:59:01] quickening
[1:59:02] power. And you may seems like you alone
[1:59:04] in the
[1:59:05] fight. I must tell you that if the
[1:59:07] quickening power is in you, nothing
[1:59:09] stand against you shall
[1:59:11] prosper. Because Jesus says that fear
[1:59:14] not because I have overcome the
[1:59:17] world. It doesn't matter. The Bible
[1:59:19] tells you that you shall possess the
[1:59:21] gates of your enemies.
[1:59:24] But in order for you to possess the Holy
[1:59:26] Ghost must be upon
[1:59:28] you. The reason why Jesus Christ rose
[1:59:30] from the dead is so he could send us the
[1:59:32] Holy Ghost.
[1:59:34] So you are you in other words you are
[1:59:37] not it seems like you don't really
[1:59:38] understand the meaning of resurrection
[1:59:40] if you don't understand that you must
[1:59:41] get the Holy
[1:59:46] Ghost because you remember when Jesus
[1:59:48] was going he says that I must go to the
[1:59:50] father so I can send you the
[1:59:55] comfort because because Jesus knew that
[1:59:58] especially in the age of Leodia the
[1:59:59] temptations and the battle was going to
[2:00:01] be stronger.
[2:00:07] But he understood that. For instance,
[2:00:09] let's get back to the story of Samson.
[2:00:11] When the quickening spir got up got on
[2:00:14] Samson, he overcame thousands of
[2:00:18] Philistines. Samson became a one-man
[2:00:22] army. When the quickness far against
[2:00:24] you, you become a oneman army.
[2:00:27] And in those moments again says that in
[2:00:30] my weakness his strength is perfect.
[2:00:33] So therefore let the weak say I am
[2:00:36] strong. Let the poor say I am rich. Why?
[2:00:40] Because I've got the rich the the the
[2:00:42] the quickening power in me. That that
[2:00:45] quickening power is is the father. My
[2:00:49] father owns all the
[2:00:51] riches. My father has all the strength.
[2:00:55] You know, you must have the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:58] That's why Jesus died on the cross.
[2:01:02] In Acts 2:38,
[2:01:05] you know, the disciples waited in the
[2:01:07] upper
[2:01:10] room. They they waited for that promise
[2:01:12] of the father because remember the
[2:01:15] question here is how do we know that God
[2:01:18] rose? You need to ask yourself that
[2:01:20] question in your life. How do you We're
[2:01:22] here celebrating the resurrection, but
[2:01:24] do you know what the resurrection is? We
[2:01:27] are here celebrating the resurrection,
[2:01:28] but the devil doesn't care about you
[2:01:30] celebrating the
[2:01:32] resurrection. The devil wants to see a
[2:01:34] resurrection in your
[2:01:35] life. The prophet is saying quickly
[2:01:38] means to bring what's dead to make it
[2:01:41] alive. The pro the devil doesn't care if
[2:01:44] you just hear saying God rose from the
[2:01:47] dead because out there in the world they
[2:01:49] celebrate the same thing.
[2:01:52] But there's a different when a Christian
[2:01:54] celebrates
[2:01:55] resurrection. What is the different and
[2:01:57] different is because you have
[2:01:58] experienced the
[2:01:59] resurrection. Brothers, I'm here to tell
[2:02:01] you that the resurrection is a person.
[2:02:04] The resurrection is not an
[2:02:06] event. The world is celebrating an event
[2:02:10] but we are celebrating the person of
[2:02:12] Jesus
[2:02:12] Christ. And it says that I live you
[2:02:15] shall live
[2:02:16] also. We are to be different. You know,
[2:02:19] we shouldn't like this morning, I I
[2:02:22] received a message from from my
[2:02:24] apartment. They're also celebrating the
[2:02:27] resurrection.
[2:02:28] But what makes you a special class of
[2:02:31] people is the revelation that you get of
[2:02:33] the
[2:02:35] resurrection. So this morning, shift
[2:02:37] your focus this morning. I want
[2:02:39] everybody to leave out of this church
[2:02:41] with an experience of the
[2:02:43] resurrection. Like I preached the other
[2:02:45] time, how if someone comes to you and
[2:02:47] ask you, "How do you know that?" I want
[2:02:48] to I want the Lord Jesus Christ to save
[2:02:51] me. How are you going to lead that
[2:02:54] person to Christ when you've never
[2:02:55] experienced
[2:02:57] God? When someone witness the
[2:02:59] resurrection, it changes the person. It
[2:03:02] he takes all the fear away. You know,
[2:03:05] the disciples were afraid. They couldn't
[2:03:07] even go out. But when they witness the
[2:03:11] resurrection, they saw Jesus is like,
[2:03:14] you can see that I'm
[2:03:16] alive. Touch me. This is not a spirit.
[2:03:19] I'm the same Jesus that once lived. I
[2:03:23] died, but I rose again. And I changed
[2:03:26] the
[2:03:27] disciples and he brought result. If you
[2:03:30] want to see the result of God in your
[2:03:31] life, you need to witness the
[2:03:33] resurrection. The resurrection is the
[2:03:35] person of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[2:03:37] Jesus Christ wants to be welcome in your
[2:03:40] life. But he will not come in unless if
[2:03:42] you invite
[2:03:44] him. Quickening
[2:03:46] spirit. That spirit if he can quicken
[2:03:49] the
[2:03:49] bones, he will quicken anything in your
[2:03:52] life. What is dead in your life? What is
[2:03:56] dead in your life? Is your spiritual
[2:03:58] life with God
[2:03:59] dead? If it's dead, you need that
[2:04:01] quickness
[2:04:03] spirit. Are your finances dead? I'm here
[2:04:06] to tell you that the quickness spirit
[2:04:08] can also give you
[2:04:09] finances. That quickness spirit. That's
[2:04:11] why the Bible says I can do all things
[2:04:13] through
[2:04:15] Christ. I can do all things through that
[2:04:17] quickness
[2:04:19] spirit. That's why when a man has the
[2:04:21] Holy Ghost, all things become
[2:04:24] possible. That quickness spirit is a
[2:04:27] token of the
[2:04:29] resurrection. You cannot talk about the
[2:04:31] resurrection without the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:34] Brothers, that's why the prophet says
[2:04:35] that the token was the highlight of my
[2:04:39] ministry. The token was the highlight of
[2:04:42] brother Brandham's
[2:04:43] ministry. The token is the highlight of
[2:04:46] this
[2:04:47] ministry. I am not a good preacher if I
[2:04:50] don't preach about the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:52] Because this world cannot change you. I
[2:04:55] cannot give you healing. I cannot give
[2:04:58] you money. I cannot save you. But I know
[2:05:00] one person who can. He's the God of the
[2:05:03] resurrection.
[2:05:05] And the God of the resurrection, he
[2:05:06] says, "I will never fail you, brothers.
[2:05:09] Even when you die, even if they bury you
[2:05:12] 10,000 feet below the earth, the God of
[2:05:15] the resurrection will not fail you. The
[2:05:18] God of the resurrection will be
[2:05:20] there." Because he says, "I'll never
[2:05:22] leave one person
[2:05:24] behind." Jesus was the example. He was
[2:05:27] buried for three days. Oh, corruption
[2:05:30] wanted to come in but the the corruption
[2:05:33] wanted to come in but the corruption
[2:05:35] could not even touch
[2:05:36] Jesus. Corruption could not touch him.
[2:05:40] God remembered that God said in the
[2:05:42] third day I will rise
[2:05:43] again. God remembered about his promise.
[2:05:47] Oh, you are not serving a a a God who
[2:05:49] doesn't remember. When God makes a
[2:05:52] promise, he always stands with his
[2:05:53] promise. You know if God remember that
[2:05:55] he will rise Christ again on the third
[2:05:57] day. God says that in the last day I
[2:06:01] will when you'll hear my voice you will
[2:06:03] rise
[2:06:04] again. And God will remember I have my
[2:06:07] children that needs to
[2:06:09] rise. That's why Joseph said do not bury
[2:06:13] my bones
[2:06:14] here when I die. Take my bones and take
[2:06:18] them in the promised land. Brothers and
[2:06:21] sisters we have a promise of God. Our
[2:06:24] Canaan is the Holy Ghost. Our Canaan is
[2:06:27] the Holy Ghost. Joseph said, "Do not
[2:06:30] bury my body in
[2:06:31] Egypt." Jacob made Joseph promise.
[2:06:34] Promise me to not leave my bones here.
[2:06:37] Take my bones to the promised land. Why?
[2:06:40] Because one day I know that God will
[2:06:43] come. He will rise and he will quicken
[2:06:46] my body. I want to rise without
[2:06:49] Christians.
[2:06:50] Oh brothers and sisters, do not bury my
[2:06:53] bones in the
[2:06:55] world. My bones will not stay in Iowa.
[2:06:59] My bones will not stay in
[2:07:01] demon. Oh, even if I die today, my bones
[2:07:04] will not stay here. Even if they burn me
[2:07:07] with fire, my bones will not stay here.
[2:07:11] Take my bones in the Holy Ghost. Take my
[2:07:13] bones in Christ. I want to live in God.
[2:07:17] Why? Because I know that one day He will
[2:07:20] come for me. One day he come for you.
[2:07:24] One day Jesus is going to come for you.
[2:07:27] You got to
[2:07:28] believe one day Jesus is going to come
[2:07:31] for you.
[2:07:32] Remember it's the quickening
[2:07:35] power. What a
[2:07:37] spirit. What a weird
[2:07:39] spirit. It's the proof that Jesus rose
[2:07:42] from the dead.
[2:07:44] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. The the grave
[2:07:47] could not contain Jesus.
[2:07:49] The grave could not contain you. Well,
[2:07:52] let me rephrase it. The grave could not
[2:07:54] contain you. Why? Because as long as
[2:07:57] I've got Jesus in me, there's nothing
[2:08:00] that can stand against me. As long as
[2:08:03] I've got Jesus in me, the Bible says you
[2:08:06] shall possess the gates of your
[2:08:08] enemies. What are your
[2:08:10] gates? We are here celebrating the
[2:08:12] resurrection.
[2:08:14] as the world does. I love people who
[2:08:16] have received the revelation of the
[2:08:19] resurrection. What is that g in front of
[2:08:21] you?
[2:08:23] Jesus is here this morning.
[2:08:27] But Jesus loves
[2:08:30] witnesses. That's it's not in vain that
[2:08:32] Jesus says I send you to be my
[2:08:36] witness. God always likes to stand
[2:08:38] behind his word.
[2:08:42] Today, Jesus is here to prove to you
[2:08:44] that he rose from the
[2:08:46] dead. I'm here to tell you that there's
[2:08:48] not a sickness that can stand against
[2:08:51] you. There's not anything that can stand
[2:08:54] before
[2:08:54] you. When the Holy Ghost comes upon you,
[2:08:58] it makes the
[2:09:01] difference. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When
[2:09:03] the Holy Ghost comes upon you, it makes
[2:09:06] a difference. Your children, you want
[2:09:08] your childrens to be saved.
[2:09:11] It's not up to you to save your
[2:09:13] children. Look to God. I'm here to tell
[2:09:16] you the Holy Spirit is saying when the
[2:09:20] Holy Ghost will come upon them, it will
[2:09:23] quicken their mortal body. They used to
[2:09:26] live in sin. But the Holy Ghost is going
[2:09:29] to quicken them from sin to
[2:09:31] life. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost makes
[2:09:35] the difference.
[2:09:37] The Holy Ghost makes the difference.
[2:09:41] Satan tried to disturb this service.
[2:09:44] Why? Because he know he knew we were
[2:09:45] going to talk about the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:48] We don't talk about the Holy Ghost the
[2:09:50] way the world talks about the Holy
[2:09:51] Ghost. We want a living God. We are here
[2:09:55] for a living God. God be with us then
[2:09:59] miracles. Brothers, I refuse to serve a
[2:10:02] dead
[2:10:03] God. I refuse to serve a dead God.
[2:10:07] Refuse to serve a dead God.
[2:10:10] Jesus rose from the dead
[2:10:13] and he wants you to be a
[2:10:15] witness. When you go to work, witness
[2:10:17] that and know that God is alive because
[2:10:20] he promised me the Holy Ghost. And he
[2:10:22] gave me the Holy Ghost. And if I don't
[2:10:25] have the Holy Ghost, he said, "Ask and
[2:10:27] you shall
[2:10:28] receive." He said, "When the Holy Ghost
[2:10:31] shall fall upon you."
[2:10:34] So we have a promise
[2:10:36] brothers and these are things I've
[2:10:38] experienced in my life.
[2:10:42] I'm not going to go into the
[2:10:45] details. A few services
[2:10:48] ago, a few services ago, I was preaching
[2:10:52] and the Holy Spirit fall came upon me at
[2:10:55] the end of the service and Jesus took
[2:10:58] control of my voice and you can check it
[2:11:00] on the live stream. The Holy Ghost says
[2:11:03] that if there's something that I needed
[2:11:05] in my life, the Holy Ghost says that I,
[2:11:09] the Lord Jesus Christ, if you need that
[2:11:11] thing, I the Lord Jesus Christ give it
[2:11:13] to you.
[2:11:14] That's something that I hadn't heard in
[2:11:16] nine
[2:11:17] years. In nine years. But I'm here as a
[2:11:20] witness to tell you that it can't it's
[2:11:22] coming just to pass as the Holy Ghost
[2:11:24] said. That thing is starting to move.
[2:11:27] Why? The difference is the Holy Ghost
[2:11:29] said
[2:11:29] it. It doesn't matter how long you've
[2:11:32] been waiting for something. It doesn't
[2:11:34] matter how long you've been dead in sin.
[2:11:37] When the Holy Ghost comes, it makes a
[2:11:39] difference. Another example was right.
[2:11:43] Oh, she was a mother. She was praying
[2:11:45] for her children. Had writes was praying
[2:11:47] for her children. But you you notice the
[2:11:50] difference is that there had to be a
[2:11:52] time for the Holy Ghost to be in the
[2:11:53] room. Hallelujah. Had he writes when the
[2:11:56] Holy Ghost came upon the prophet. And
[2:11:59] the Holy Ghost said, "Ask what you will
[2:12:02] right now. He will be given to you. Not
[2:12:05] tomorrow, but right now he will be given
[2:12:08] to you." Brothers, the same Holy Ghost
[2:12:10] is here this morning. The same Holy
[2:12:12] Ghost is saying ask what you will not
[2:12:16] tomorrow but today. Today that thing is
[2:12:19] going to come to pass. Why? Because that
[2:12:22] Jesus is the same yesterday and forever.
[2:12:26] When the Holy Ghost said it, the prophet
[2:12:29] right for asked for the the salvation of
[2:12:31] her
[2:12:33] children. And if you listen to the
[2:12:35] prophet testimony, the childrens were
[2:12:37] out there laughing at at the at the
[2:12:39] parents. Well, but when she asked that
[2:12:42] and brother Bham says, I give it to you
[2:12:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. At
[2:12:46] that very same moment, those children
[2:12:48] started
[2:12:49] crying. Brothers, anything you want, you
[2:12:53] know, when the Holy Ghost comes in the
[2:12:56] room, believe on the Holy Ghost, you
[2:12:59] will see the glory of God. When the Holy
[2:13:02] Ghost come, there's not a gate that can
[2:13:04] stand against
[2:13:05] you. Stop living below your privileges.
[2:13:09] You are sons and daughters of God.
[2:13:12] We the prophet the pastor talked about
[2:13:14] the pill of fire. But why did this pill
[2:13:17] of fire came? This pill of fire came to
[2:13:20] tell us that this message is the
[2:13:21] truth. This pill of fire came to tell us
[2:13:25] there have been many people in the past
[2:13:26] who came. They thought they were the
[2:13:29] prophet of the
[2:13:30] age. I looked even into the uh the I
[2:13:33] think it says the church of Christ. They
[2:13:36] also believe that Jo Joseph Smith is is
[2:13:38] Malachi
[2:13:40] 4. They also believe that Joseph Smith
[2:13:43] is Malachi 4.
[2:13:45] But the difference
[2:13:47] is their Malachi 4 had never been
[2:13:51] vindicated. Amen. Amen. And if you
[2:13:55] notice, the the the God did not just
[2:13:58] come to vindicate the
[2:14:00] prophet, but he came to vindicate the
[2:14:03] message. To vindicate that this message
[2:14:06] did not come from a man, that he came
[2:14:08] from God. And he came to vindicate that
[2:14:11] this message is the proof that Jesus
[2:14:13] rose from the
[2:14:14] dead. Brothers, that holy that pillow of
[2:14:17] fire should not just remain on the in
[2:14:18] the
[2:14:19] picture. that that pill of fire is in
[2:14:22] the room right
[2:14:23] now. What is making you excited? What is
[2:14:26] making you happy? What is it not
[2:14:29] yourself? Oh, Satan doesn't want you to
[2:14:31] be happy. Satan doesn't want you to be
[2:14:34] happy. It's the Holy Ghost. It's the
[2:14:37] pill on fire. But you notice in a
[2:14:39] prophet's
[2:14:40] ministry, there used to be a time where
[2:14:42] the Holy Ghost was just on the
[2:14:45] side and the prophet would say, "But now
[2:14:48] that pill of fire is entering into
[2:14:51] me, brothers, right now the Holy Ghost
[2:14:53] is in your
[2:14:55] side, but the Holy Ghost want to enter
[2:14:57] into
[2:14:59] you." Right now, the Holy Ghost want to
[2:15:01] enter into
[2:15:03] you, but you need to invite
[2:15:06] him. The reason you know I give I give a
[2:15:09] lot of testimonies and this week this
[2:15:12] week the devil was trying to get me a
[2:15:14] work.
[2:15:17] You know when I was preparing this this
[2:15:18] thing I I I wrote the testimony there
[2:15:22] and Satan said man you give too many
[2:15:25] testimonies. Satan said the people are
[2:15:27] going to get tired to hear you giving
[2:15:30] testimonies. So we here to prove that
[2:15:32] the devil is a liar.
[2:15:35] Are you tired to hear the testimonies of
[2:15:37] God? God is my God is my witness. I've
[2:15:39] never lied on anything I say here in the
[2:15:41] pulpit. And when I say it, I give it to
[2:15:43] the glory of God.
[2:15:46] God has been too good for
[2:15:48] me. And the reason why I give those
[2:15:50] testimonies, I want you to experience
[2:15:53] that same
[2:15:54] God because if God can do it for me, he
[2:15:57] can do it for you.
[2:16:00] one testimony that I'm gonna give
[2:16:01] another one again that happened
[2:16:05] recently that happened recently. Um I I
[2:16:08] I started a second job and I think I
[2:16:10] told some some people in the
[2:16:12] church I was bragging about you know
[2:16:15] starting a second job and all that. So I
[2:16:17] was working two jobs at the same time
[2:16:20] for about two
[2:16:21] weeks. But little did I know that it was
[2:16:24] God preparing everything for
[2:16:26] me because a few weeks maybe two weeks
[2:16:29] after I started my second
[2:16:31] job my company start my first job's
[2:16:34] company had some companywide
[2:16:38] layoff and like last week I found out
[2:16:41] that I got laid off from my first
[2:16:44] job but my God was faithful to me. A guy
[2:16:50] knew that I was going to be laid off and
[2:16:53] he provided to me a second job before I
[2:16:55] even could finish the first
[2:16:57] job. Why? Because I trust God. But if
[2:17:01] God can do it for me, he can do it for
[2:17:03] you.
[2:17:05] Amen. I'm going to find something to end
[2:17:08] with. I had a lot more things to say
[2:17:11] here, but I'll save it for another
[2:17:14] day. Amen. The prophet says, I think I
[2:17:18] have the quote here. He said, uh, it's,
[2:17:20] let me
[2:17:29] see. The prophet said, uh, I can't find
[2:17:32] it here, but it says like it's not the
[2:17:34] the word doesn't quicken.
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:38] Yeah. Yeah, I find it. It's in the
[2:17:39] Eastern Seal, paragraph 52.
[2:17:42] The prophet says it's the spirit that
[2:17:45] quickens.
[2:17:47] He says it's not the word that
[2:17:51] quickens. We have too many people here
[2:17:53] that know the message from A to
[2:17:56] Z, but no experiences with
[2:17:59] God. Satan doesn't care about that.
[2:18:02] Satan knew the word. He quoted the word
[2:18:05] to
[2:18:05] Jesus. It's not the word that quickens.
[2:18:09] The word is the mechanics, but the
[2:18:11] mechanic needs the dynamic. We need the
[2:18:14] word and we need the spirit. Brothers
[2:18:18] and sisters, I'm tired of coming to
[2:18:20] church and not experiencing the move of
[2:18:22] God. When when brother was preaching,
[2:18:26] God was in the room. God was vindicating
[2:18:29] the message. It was the same message
[2:18:32] that we are
[2:18:33] preaching. And that that pillar of fire
[2:18:35] is supposed to vindicate the same
[2:18:37] message.
[2:18:40] It's the spirit. The prophet says it's
[2:18:42] the spirit that quickens the
[2:18:45] word or gives the word life.
[2:18:49] So we have the word but the word needs
[2:18:52] life.
[2:18:53] And he says it gives it wings to
[2:18:57] fly. It's the spirit that does
[2:19:01] it. Examine your life this morning.
[2:19:05] Some of us know the message very well,
[2:19:08] more than even
[2:19:11] me. You say one thing, they already have
[2:19:13] a quote for you for
[2:19:14] that. One thing, they already have a
[2:19:16] quote for you. But I'm asking you this
[2:19:18] question. What has those quotes done to
[2:19:22] you? Knowing those quotes alone didn't
[2:19:25] do nothing to
[2:19:26] you. Why? Because you are missing that
[2:19:29] thing that makes those quotes leave.
[2:19:33] My message to you this
[2:19:34] morning that Jesus rose from the dead
[2:19:38] and he wants this message to become a
[2:19:41] reality. Is there anybody that wants the
[2:19:43] message to be a reality in their
[2:19:46] life? One more quote and I'll
[2:19:49] end the prophet in the same message
[2:19:51] paragraph
[2:19:53] 44. He says, "What is the Pentecostal
[2:19:57] blessing? It's the confirmation of the
[2:19:59] resurrection.
[2:20:02] No wonder the gospel is the gospel
[2:20:04] itself means good news
[2:20:08] good news of what he has raised from the
[2:20:12] dead and because I
[2:20:15] live remember it's because Jesus
[2:20:19] lives ye live
[2:20:21] also ye which were once dead in sin and
[2:20:26] trespasses. I hope he's talking to
[2:20:28] someone this morning.
[2:20:30] Let me make it personal. I which once
[2:20:33] was dead in sin and trespassing,
[2:20:37] God has waken us together by the spirits
[2:20:40] that rose Jesus from the
[2:20:42] dead. And we are now sitting in heavenly
[2:20:47] places with him communing with
[2:20:52] him. We are now sitting in heavenly
[2:20:56] places communing with him.
[2:21:00] I was looking for a quote here, but it
[2:21:03] seems like no wonder we The prophet
[2:21:05] says, "No wonder we lay hands on the
[2:21:06] sick.
[2:21:09] No wonder we love one
[2:21:12] another. We are brothers and
[2:21:15] sisters." He says, "We shouldn't hate
[2:21:17] one another because we are corrected by
[2:21:20] the word of God.
[2:21:23] We should love one
[2:21:25] another and have respect for one
[2:21:29] another. The Bible says, you know, if
[2:21:31] you
[2:21:33] don't, the quickening spirits won't help
[2:21:36] you. That's a powerful quote. The
[2:21:39] prophet is saying if you don't have
[2:21:40] respect one for
[2:21:42] another, if you don't love one
[2:21:45] another, that quickening spirit won't
[2:21:48] help you.
[2:21:50] Job had that hope. Job says that even
[2:21:53] though the worms ate my
[2:21:56] flesh, it destroyed his
[2:21:59] body, yet in my flesh shall I see
[2:22:03] God. Job did not say, "In my spirit
[2:22:06] shall I see
[2:22:07] God. Yet in my
[2:22:10] flesh shall I see God."
[2:22:13] God bless
[2:22:15] you.
[2:22:23] Amen. Amen.
[2:22:26] Ain't God good?
[2:22:29] We appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:22:33] I told
[2:22:34] uh brother Liz Paul since he was the
[2:22:37] last
[2:22:38] one he could have some extra
[2:22:42] time and I'm glad he did.
[2:22:46] Everything fell in order. We had only
[2:22:48] four ministers at the
[2:22:52] first brother John was going to come.
[2:22:55] So we stuck him in. That made
[2:22:58] five grace and I appreciate him
[2:23:04] ministry. Like everything went in order.
[2:23:09] Let's give God a round of applause.
[2:23:14] We we we love the Lord.
[2:23:18] Amen. And brother, give me a key of
[2:23:22] C. We we you know, we would have been
[2:23:24] outside
[2:23:26] talking. So, let's let's end. We're
[2:23:28] going to we're going to have communion,
[2:23:30] too, right? Those who want to have
[2:23:32] communion, we'll do it right after
[2:23:34] services. Those who need to leave or
[2:23:36] whatever, you're more than welcome.
[2:23:39] here.
[2:23:41] Uh, ladies and
[2:23:45] gentlemen, may I have your attention?
[2:23:52] I'd like to
[2:23:55] introduce to
[2:24:00] you in this
[2:24:04] corner of the
[2:24:06] good and the
[2:24:10] right stands a champion rob in
[2:24:17] white. His heart exceeds the
[2:24:22] heavens. His weight outweighs the
[2:24:27] world. His
[2:24:29] reach reaches everywhere. His
[2:24:35] age is ever
[2:24:39] more. He is higher than the highest.
[2:24:45] He's greater than the
[2:24:49] great. No one could ever take his
[2:24:54] crown
[2:24:57] away. He's more mighty than the
[2:25:02] mightiest. He reign from
[2:25:08] above. He's the
[2:25:12] alltime undefeated
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:16] undefeated
[2:25:18] champion of
[2:25:23] love. He left his
[2:25:27] hometown to enter this
[2:25:31] arena to raise his head in
[2:25:35] victory for you and me. But you see,
[2:25:40] there was a angry crowd that cried,
[2:25:44] "Crucify him,
[2:25:47] he who wore their
[2:25:50] crown." And they watched my champion
[2:25:54] growing
[2:25:57] down. But I will never count him out.
[2:26:03] Cuz I'm a witness
[2:26:06] of that day.
[2:26:09] He rose to proclaim,
[2:26:14] share beyond of
[2:26:18] love. He is higher than the high. Help
[2:26:23] me sing it. He's greater than the
[2:26:27] great. No one could ever take his crown
[2:26:34] away.
[2:26:37] He's more mighty than the
[2:26:40] mightiest and he reign from
[2:26:50] above. Oh, he's the
[2:26:54] alltime
[2:26:56] undisputed,
[2:26:58] undefeated
[2:27:00] champion of love.
[2:27:04] Oh yes, he's higher than the
[2:27:09] highest. He's greater than the
[2:27:13] great. No one could ever take his
[2:27:18] crown away.
[2:27:22] He's more mighty than the
[2:27:26] mightiest and he reign from
[2:27:39] a time
[2:27:42] undisputed
[2:27:44] undefeated
[2:27:46] champion of love.
[2:27:49] [Laughter]
[2:27:54] [Music]
[2:27:57] I only sang that song because brother
[2:27:59] Liz Paul wanted me
[2:28:03] to and I told him I would by the grace
[2:28:05] of
[2:28:07] God. I appreciate everybody today. I
[2:28:10] know
[2:28:11] some of us
[2:28:15] um Okay. Okay. By the grace of God,
[2:28:19] Sister Annie's
[2:28:26] birthday. Y like y'all sad.
[2:28:30] You can't be tired.
[2:28:33] I don't believe you're
[2:28:35] tired. Some of y'all say, "Yes, I am."
[2:28:39] No. Not with the word came the way the
[2:28:42] way the word came.
[2:28:46] I guarantee you if I was serving some
[2:28:48] food out there, you wouldn't be tired.
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:55] Be right in line in it. Yeah, it's true.
[2:28:58] Right in line.
[2:29:00] But you know, this is more important
[2:29:04] these days.
[2:29:06] You're going to wish you had them.
[2:29:10] Brother Brandham said, "This kind of
[2:29:12] service one day will become a fond
[2:29:15] memory.
[2:29:18] The church world is going to shut this
[2:29:19] down one
[2:29:21] day. You better enjoy Jesus while you
[2:29:26] can. I don't get tired of
[2:29:29] him." And you know, I told y'all I could
[2:29:31] have church every day and then y'all get
[2:29:32] quiet on
[2:29:35] me. But God knows that's the truth.
[2:29:38] every day.
[2:29:40] I can have him every day. Somebody
[2:29:42] somebody preaching.
[2:29:44] I appreciate every every preacher that
[2:29:46] came
[2:29:48] up almighty God we serve.
[2:29:52] What a variation in the gifts.
[2:29:55] See, some of y'all want to just hear one
[2:29:57] side, but no, no, no.
[2:30:02] And you know I love
[2:30:04] everyone teacher, whether it be
[2:30:05] preacher, whether it be exaltation,
[2:30:08] whether it
[2:30:09] be I always see Jesus.
[2:30:12] God always give me something to
[2:30:17] Amen. Hallelujah. You know, it's
[2:30:22] amazing how God works.
[2:30:28] And he threw love in the middle of
[2:30:32] it. Comes back with a love quote.
[2:30:37] And then just how God I love that
[2:30:41] you can't celebrate Easter
[2:30:45] if you don't know that Easter is a
[2:30:47] person.
[2:30:50] and you must have that
[2:30:53] revelation is not a holiday.
[2:30:57] It's an experience experience God
[2:31:01] resurrected in you. Oh,
[2:31:04] I I wish I wish before we we we start
[2:31:06] the next portion of this service.
[2:31:11] I'd like to have an African song with
[2:31:12] some dancing.
[2:31:16] Yeah. See that? See that? And now y'all
[2:31:18] sit back in your chair.
[2:31:21] Y'all need to stop that. This is
[2:31:24] I felt that. It was like a wave.
[2:31:28] You're ready to go. Y'all waiting for
[2:31:29] that dinner. Whatever y'all got.
[2:31:32] We're going to pray for our sister
[2:31:34] Annie. This is Brother
[2:31:36] John. Lovely
[2:31:39] wife. She's been always kind to my wife
[2:31:41] and
[2:31:42] I. We going to pray a special blessing
[2:31:44] for her.
[2:31:46] Father, I know it's just her birthday,
[2:31:49] but I can remember the times, Lord, that
[2:31:50] she struggled with physical
[2:31:53] ailments. Even the time she struggled
[2:31:55] with her eye and Lord, how you healed
[2:31:58] it, showing that you are resurrected,
[2:32:01] that you're the same God today as you
[2:32:03] was
[2:32:04] yesterday. Lord, I pray for our sister
[2:32:06] Annie, Lord.
[2:32:08] I remember the times, oh God, she had
[2:32:10] dreams that Satan was trying to place
[2:32:12] her. And yet, you gave her victory over
[2:32:14] all of that. You're the same God that
[2:32:18] William Brandham
[2:32:20] served. You're the same yesterday,
[2:32:22] today, and forever. He taught us that
[2:32:25] whatsoever we believe, we should have
[2:32:26] it. And Father, I pray for my sister
[2:32:29] that you give her a double portion of
[2:32:30] your Holy Spirit. I pray, Father, that
[2:32:33] you keep her and guide her and lead her
[2:32:35] in the things that she thirsts for.
[2:32:37] those righteous things. You said that
[2:32:39] you have given them all to us, but give
[2:32:41] us the faith to receive them. Bless her
[2:32:44] now that she'll be a a good mother, a
[2:32:46] good wife. Hallelujah. And most of all,
[2:32:50] a good servant for you. Bless her now.
[2:32:53] Keep her. Let no hurt come upon her. And
[2:32:56] Father, we'll be careful to give you the
[2:32:58] praise, glory, and honor. In Jesus
[2:33:00] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:33:04] In all that we say and do,
[2:33:10] Even Jesus couldn't do
[2:33:13] miracles because there was no faith.
[2:33:19] And we know by the grace of
[2:33:22] God that a man can preach all he want
[2:33:26] to but if you don't grab the
[2:33:29] word by
[2:33:31] faith it won't do you any
[2:33:34] good. Like you know people come to
[2:33:36] church with
[2:33:38] attitudes. They don't like certain
[2:33:40] people to say anything or preach
[2:33:42] anything
[2:33:45] because contrary to the
[2:33:48] word and you don't even realize that
[2:33:50] you're hindering the
[2:33:52] service and God feels you. He knows and
[2:33:56] he knows those deep dark thoughts that
[2:33:58] you have
[2:34:01] and God offered himself today.
[2:34:04] See, because you'll never get rid of
[2:34:06] those dark
[2:34:08] thoughts until the Holy Ghost come upon
[2:34:11] you. And to have such evil in you, it
[2:34:15] proves that you're lacking something
[2:34:18] because the Holy Ghost will never allow
[2:34:21] you to hold on that to that which is
[2:34:25] evil. The Holy Ghost will torment
[2:34:28] you until you make things
[2:34:32] right.
[2:34:34] Didn't see you over here, sister.
[2:34:39] Okay, the Lord.
[2:34:43] Where's Brother Danny? Danny, keep your
[2:34:46] eyes on her.
[2:34:50] Father God, we pray for my precious
[2:34:52] sister. Lord, bless her right now in the
[2:34:54] precious name of Jesus. I've seen her,
[2:34:57] Lord God. I remember the day she got
[2:34:58] baptized in your name, Jesus. Father,
[2:35:01] and I pray, Father God, that you'll
[2:35:03] continue to make Hallelujah, make her
[2:35:05] grow. I pray, Father God, that you'll
[2:35:08] keep her, Lord. Let no hurt, how much
[2:35:10] danger come upon her, Lord. Praise in
[2:35:12] your name, Jesus. This is such an evil
[2:35:14] age, Lord. Let her stay focused. Let her
[2:35:17] eyes remain on you regardless to what
[2:35:19] comes and goes. Whether it be around the
[2:35:22] house, in the house, at school, wherever
[2:35:24] it may be, keep her eyes on you, Lord
[2:35:27] Jesus. And we pray, Father, believing
[2:35:30] that you will build a wall of fire about
[2:35:32] her. She's a precious sister, Lord. God
[2:35:36] bless her now. She has such a lovely
[2:35:39] spirit. And we pray that you keep her
[2:35:41] and guide her. In your name, Jesus
[2:35:43] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:26] She has an exam. I believe that she
[2:36:28] wants God to move and help her in and
[2:36:32] she want to bring forth a testimony for
[2:36:34] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:36:36] So we pray for my precious sister. He
[2:36:38] said, "Ask whatever you will in my
[2:36:40] name." And we come in the name of Jesus
[2:36:43] Christ. He said, "And it shall be given
[2:36:46] to you, sister. You
[2:36:49] believe, you receive it, and it's yours
[2:36:53] in the name of Jesus Christ." Amen.
[2:36:56] Amen.
[2:37:03] Okay, we're going to change
[2:37:09] order. I'm trying to see some happy
[2:37:11] faces.
[2:37:18] You know, if I was afraid of man, I
[2:37:20] would be afraid right now.
[2:37:23] But I thank the Lord God I'm not.
[2:37:27] We're going to sing What a Mighty God We
[2:37:29] Serve. Some of you may have uh scheduled
[2:37:32] other
[2:37:33] things. I I don't think we made it known
[2:37:36] to you that we're having more than one
[2:37:38] preacher. And I trust
[2:37:40] that our our absent minded or negligence
[2:37:44] did not uh throw your schedule off. Some
[2:37:47] of you may have to leave. That's
[2:37:50] okay. But for those who can stay, we
[2:37:52] would love for you to
[2:37:54] stay and we're going to we're going to
[2:37:56] change the order. Uh we're going to give
[2:37:58] it over to our song leader while while I
[2:38:01] prepare
[2:38:02] myself for uh communion. Communion won't
[2:38:06] last long.
[2:38:07] Just y'all understand why we have
[2:38:11] to because we're one bread.
[2:38:15] We're one body.
[2:38:19] My goodness. That's all. Is that it?
[2:38:24] What was that? Eight people.
[2:38:32] May the Lord bless your day hereafter.
[2:38:37] I'm not trying to joke. I joy is
[2:38:40] expressed.
[2:38:42] You know what I mean? You know, and and
[2:38:44] I'll be honest with you, I I do know.

[2:38:51] lot of a lot of the Congolese people,

[2:38:56] way. Y'all know when y'all came here,
[2:38:58] y'all didn't know how to
[2:39:01] smile at all.
[2:39:07] I I guess that was a weapon you had to
[2:39:10] use and and just to see you smiling and
[2:39:12] laughing. That's why God sent y'all here
[2:39:15] cuz I'm I'm a jovial
[2:39:18] person. I'm a jovial person and I love
[2:39:21] smiles. I love laughter, you know, I

[2:49:18] It feel quite awkward without brother
[2:49:20] Keith being here.
[2:49:24] but he's having a better time.
[2:49:30] I still can't get over it. He left me.
[2:49:35] But if I had had the choice, I would
[2:49:36] have left him, too.
[2:49:41] Oh, I love this word.
[2:49:44] It brings such a peace to my soul
[2:49:47] because really all of us are failures.
[2:49:51] Without Jesus Christ, all of us are
[2:49:54] failures.
[2:49:56] But I thank God
[2:49:58] for the grace and the mercy God has
[2:50:00] given to us.
[2:50:03] Now for those of us and I assume that
[2:50:05] all of us are here for communion.
[2:50:11] So, we're going to stand and
[2:50:16] read coming from First Corinthians.
[2:50:20] We're going to read
[2:50:23] from the 11th
[2:50:26] chapter beginning at the 23rd verse.
[2:50:31] See, for I have received of the Lord
[2:50:34] that which also I delivered unto
[2:50:37] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:50:40] in which he was betrayed, took
[2:50:43] bread, and when he had given the thanks,
[2:50:45] he broke it and said, "Take, eat, this
[2:50:48] is my body which is broken for you. This
[2:50:51] do in remembrance of me.
[2:51:04] After the same manner also he took the
[2:51:06] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[2:51:09] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[2:51:12] This do eat as often as ye drink it in
[2:51:16] remembrance of me."
[2:51:24] For as often as you eat this bread and
[2:51:26] drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's
[2:51:29] death till he come.
[2:51:39] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[2:51:41] bread and drink this
[2:51:42] cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[2:51:46] guilty of the blood body and blood of of
[2:51:48] the
[2:51:54] Lord. But let a man examine himself, and
[2:51:57] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[2:51:59] of that cup.
[2:52:04] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[2:52:06] unworthily eateth and drinkketh
[2:52:07] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[2:52:10] Lord's
[2:52:14] body. For many for this cause many are
[2:52:17] weak and sickly among you and many
[2:52:24] sleep. For if we would judge ourselves,
[2:52:27] we should not be judged. But when we are
[2:52:29] judged, we are chasened of the Lord that
[2:52:32] we should not be condemned with the
[2:52:34] world.
[2:52:39] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[2:52:41] together to eat, tarry one for another,
[2:52:44] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[2:52:46] home, that ye come together unto not,
[2:52:51] not to come, not excuse me, and if any
[2:52:54] man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye
[2:52:56] come not together unto condemnation, and
[2:52:59] the rest will I set in order when I
[2:53:01] come.
[2:53:17] Amen. Amen.
[2:54:23] even
[2:54:28] [Music]
[2:54:38] [Music]
[2:54:40] I
[2:54:43] know
[2:54:45] the victory.
[2:54:51] [Music]
[2:54:56] Love
[2:54:58] him. Oh, true.

[3:42:27] We just want to thank God for those of
[3:42:28] you who who are still here and you
[3:42:31] appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and
[3:42:34] everything that he's done for us this
[3:42:35] morning today. Uh I trust that this be
[3:42:39] Easter that that you will remember. You
[3:42:42] know, Father Brandon talked about the
[3:42:44] rapture and he said that it would one
[3:42:46] day take place in the time of
[3:42:50] Easter. One early, one early
[3:42:55] Easter. We know one thing for certain.
[3:42:58] California always make us
[3:43:01] know cuz they just had an earthquake a
[3:43:03] day or two, however long it was, not
[3:43:06] even quite a week
[3:43:08] ago 5.7
[3:43:11] and immediately as as the earthquake uh
[3:43:15] subsided, my son called me and said,
[3:43:17] "Daddy, my house just waved."
[3:43:22] They're so used to it, but that's what
[3:43:24] happens. When it does come, it'll catch
[3:43:26] them off guard.
[3:43:28] But my son declare he won't be there
[3:43:30] when it happens.
[3:43:34] Everything that's been said and done
[3:43:37] and uh my I think there was an
[3:43:39] announcement. My wife had a pray a
[3:43:42] prayer request for a lady called Karen
[3:43:45] Karen that she met at Walmart this
[3:43:48] morning and uh she has some type of
[3:43:51] cancer or something. So if we could just
[3:43:52] stand and have a word of prayer there
[3:43:55] before dismissal.
[3:43:58] Our heavenly father God, we come before
[3:44:01] you right now, Lord. And even though we
[3:44:03] don't know who Karen is, we just pray
[3:44:05] Lord God that you would give a blessing
[3:44:08] there, Lord. Touch her right now, she
[3:44:11] declare herself to be a Catholic. But
[3:44:13] Lord, if there be any faith, any any
[3:44:16] kind of faith that you could touch there
[3:44:17] to give her completely a complete
[3:44:21] healing, we will appreciate it. Lord,
[3:44:23] bless her. Bless her now in the name of
[3:44:25] Jesus Christ. we pray. Amen. And my my
[3:44:29] wife walked out on this morning. I think
[3:44:30] brother Brandon was
[3:44:32] playing and she did a little talking.
[3:44:35] She wants to apologize because she
[3:44:37] didn't realize at the time what was
[3:44:39] going on. So we pray that you pray for
[3:44:41] her and forgive her for uh making that
[3:44:46] mistake. If that be all we will be
[3:44:50] dismissed.
[3:44:53] Amen. There's no one. There's no one
