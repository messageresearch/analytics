[47:26] Lord and they did
[47:29] so the Bible describes as the 600
[47:32] chariots
[47:35] that and everyone had a captain over
[47:39] them verse number eight and the
[47:43] Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king
[47:46] of
[47:48] Egypt and he pursued after the children
[47:51] of
[47:53] Israel and the children of Israel went
[47:56] out with a high
[48:00] hand they went out with
[48:04] boldness nine it says but the Egyptians
[48:06] pursued after
[48:09] them all of the horses and Chariots of

[49:00] afraid and the children of Israel Cried
[49:02] Out unto
[49:05] whoto the Lord and they said unto
[49:10] Moses first they cried out into the
[49:13] Lord but then now they say to
[49:16] Moses because there were no graves in
[49:20] Egypt no graves

[50:08] in
[50:10] Egypt saying let us
[50:13] alone that we may serve
[50:17] who the
[50:19] Egyptians Wow Wow for it had been better
[50:24] for us to serve the
[50:29] Egyptians then we should die than that
[50:33] we should die in the
[50:35] wilderness I know you know someone who's
[50:38] like
[50:40] that sometimes we just want pity all the
[50:44] time we're obsessed with our pain and
[50:47] we're obsessed with feeling down and
[50:54] sad but there's a deliverer in the
[51:00] land verse 13 we're almost
[51:03] there and Moses said unto the
[51:07] people fear ye
[51:10] not and stand
[51:13] still and see that the salvation of the
[51:17] Lord which he will show you

[52:01] depression hold your
[52:05] peace amen you may be seated in the
[52:08] house of the
[52:10] Lord and Lord we ask that you bless the
[52:12] word this
[52:14] morning speak to us
[52:17] Lord this is not a
[52:19] show this is not a
[52:22] spectacle we came to learn from you move
[52:25] the man out of the way in Jesus name we
[52:29] pray amen amen we're in the
[52:33] house of the Lord and there's liberty
[52:36] there's Freedom
[52:38] we so let me be free for a little
[52:42] bit so now we take a look at the
[52:45] children of
[52:47] Israel and they've Exodus they're in the
[52:52] Exodus to exit
[52:56] to exit is to
[52:58] leave they have left the
[53:00] world and they are walking towards their
[53:06] promise but God is God right he doesn't
[53:11] want anything to be easy for
[53:14] us just you know Easy Street we call
[53:20] it he sends the
[53:23] deliverer but then he also sends the
[53:28] enemy what so The God Who wants you to
[53:31] have a wonderful prosperous life a great
[53:36] life will deliver you but then send your
[53:40] enemy
[53:44] towards
[53:46] you but he also tells you that I'll make
[53:48] you a seat at the table of
[53:53] who of
[53:56] enemies so that you prosper in their
[54:00] face not in
[54:05] secret so now
[54:07] God the god of Heaven starts to deal
[54:11] with the heart of
[54:13] Pharaoh Pharaoh who who's who's going to
[54:16] build the
[54:18] pyramids who who's going to who's going
[54:20] to fight for you who's going to take
[54:22] care of the
[54:23] soldiers who's going to who's going to
[54:25] cut the
[54:27] grass who's going to run
[54:30] Walmart walm who's going to do that
[54:34] she's speaking in Pharaoh's ear just
[54:35] telling them all those
[54:38] things remember your firstborn
[54:41] Pharaoh aren't those the
[54:44] people it begins to do something in the
[54:48] heart and now Pharaoh is
[54:51] there and and he has everything he ever
[54:53] wants in his life
[54:56] but now he wants
[54:59] you so now his heart is
[55:03] hardened and then he stands
[55:05] up 600
[55:09] chariots 600
[55:12] captains left stand up stand up go get
[55:17] every single person
[55:19] there and bring them back
[55:22] here we have work to do
[55:26] whose Army are you fighting for this
[55:29] morning we have work to do
[55:33] here but God knew what he was
[55:37] doing he always knows what he's
[55:40] doing and the Bible says that
[55:43] I I God will harden Pharaoh's
[55:48] Hearts but I
[55:52] myself the Lord will get the
[55:57] glory through Pharaoh's
[56:00] Army and they will
[56:03] know that I
[56:05] am the
[56:08] Lord I was reading
[56:11] somewhere this writer
[56:14] said that the beginning of
[56:18] anxiety is the end of
[56:21] faith and the beginning of true faith
[56:26] is the end of
[56:28] anxiety what do you
[56:31] want so when this is taking place
[56:35] now the children of Israel begin to get
[56:41] anxious because they're they they don't
[56:44] understand how big God
[56:47] Is So if Jesus Christ is the same
[56:49] yesterday today and
[56:52] forever if he has delivered them them
[56:55] from the grip of
[56:58] pharaoh why won't he do it
[57:01] again they were in captivity for 420
[57:06] years 420
[57:11] years and God finally delivered
[57:15] them God will use your
[57:18] enemies to show his
[57:22] glory but when things get a little
[57:24] anxious
[57:31] when when when things get a little
[57:33] difficult we we begin
[57:36] to get
[57:39] anxious we begin to take things in our
[57:41] own
[57:43] hands before we used to pray for
[57:48] food now we Rejoice for food
[57:52] stamps we the enemy has put so many
[57:55] substitutions in
[57:59] God we used to rise up in the morning
[58:02] for I'm immigrant so don't don't me any
[58:05] other way I'm an
[58:06] immigrant we used to rise up in the
[58:08] morning first
[58:12] thing and go fight for
[58:14] work nowadays we can just sit
[58:18] home and the government can send us a
[58:21] check it's easy that way but God is
[58:24] looking for an
[58:26] army what are you going to teach your
[58:29] children you have to stand
[58:32] up but now anxiety can set in our
[58:37] hearts we begin to take things in our
[58:39] own
[58:40] head we begin to find different programs
[58:43] and different things we
[58:46] Mo we move from City to
[58:49] City looking to see how we can receive
[58:51] the greatest
[58:53] benefits
[58:55] but have you tried
[58:57] Jesus he's waiting for
[59:01] you let
[59:03] go of what you're holding on
[59:07] to and now he's looking for
[59:09] you but now there's anxiety in the
[59:13] camp at some point they were
[59:17] rejoicing they were
[59:19] rejoicing we marching to
[59:22] Z beautiful Zion
[59:27] they were
[59:28] rejoicing clapping their
[59:31] hands
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:34] jerus all of these things they were
[59:36] rejoicing as they were
[59:39] leaving Moses W to Moses just read
[59:45] Mo her
[59:49] son am and Jed's
[59:53] son I knew that that God was going to be
[59:56] great I told you
[59:58] Moses I tell you I saw I knew he was
[1:00:01] going to be
[1:00:02] great they were rejoicing because they
[1:00:05] entered into the
[1:00:07] Exodus but when the trouble started to
[1:00:10] come
[1:00:14] to why don't you just let us
[1:00:17] die I love being a slave
[1:00:21] Moses they told me when to eat
[1:00:26] they told me when to
[1:00:28] sleep they gave us
[1:00:30] meat they gave us
[1:00:32] onions they gave us
[1:00:35] p and they gave us
[1:00:38] spices we ate good
[1:00:42] Moses now what do we
[1:00:44] have so now they wanted to become
[1:00:47] dependent again on the person that is
[1:00:49] making you a
[1:00:53] Slave but there is a light that stands
[1:00:56] in the middle of
[1:00:59] the so now we're as we're progressing
[1:01:04] forward God tells them to
[1:01:07] rest but as they
[1:01:09] rest they start to hear a uncertain
[1:01:12] sound coming from behind
[1:01:14] them there was Pentecost happening in
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:18] camp but behind them there was uncertain
[1:01:22] sound they could hear trumpets
[1:01:26] they could hear
[1:01:28] horses but but wait what does that
[1:01:31] sound but what did Moses
[1:01:33] do he kept his eye on the
[1:01:38] pill the cloud that led by
[1:01:42] day he didn't look left or right he kept
[1:01:45] moving
[1:01:47] forward
[1:01:49] until they came up to
[1:01:52] him and told him that
[1:01:55] and in my
[1:01:56] mind I bet you they were
[1:01:59] scared they knew Moses had anger
[1:02:03] issues if you read your Bible you know
[1:02:06] that Moses are you hey bro John are you
[1:02:09] going to tell
[1:02:11] Moses you the Egyptians are
[1:02:13] coming I thought we were
[1:02:16] free they begin to doubt their
[1:02:20] Deliverance they begin to doubt their
[1:02:23] prophet
[1:02:25] because things got a little
[1:02:28] difficult but as they're moving
[1:02:32] forward they begin to just
[1:02:36] worship because they
[1:02:38] know that God dwells in the presence of
[1:02:40] the
[1:02:44] worship and in my mind this is what I
[1:02:48] picture the elderly has walking
[1:02:52] forward the elderly were walking
[1:02:56] forward with tears in their
[1:02:59] eyes because they
[1:03:03] remember they
[1:03:05] remember
[1:03:07] captivity the younger
[1:03:09] ones were moving
[1:03:12] forward with
[1:03:14] joy but they also remember
[1:03:18] that and the young the ones who just got
[1:03:20] married freshly
[1:03:22] married they were already talking about
[1:03:24] the plans of the promis land they going
[1:03:27] do I'll work here and
[1:03:30] there that's what they'll tell this is
[1:03:32] my
[1:03:34] mind don't say it's a
[1:03:37] doctr this what going on in their
[1:03:40] minds they're making plans of their
[1:03:43] future but as the enemy
[1:03:47] approaches they begin to get
[1:03:50] anxious but God dwells in the the
[1:03:54] presence of his
[1:03:56] worship the Revival begin to die
[1:04:00] down because the enemy was coming closer
[1:04:03] and
[1:04:05] closer but it's important for us to
[1:04:09] worship and every step you
[1:04:13] take is
[1:04:15] yours it's your
[1:04:18] possession when you're not
[1:04:20] worshiping you're being
[1:04:23] stagnant
[1:04:26] it's not good to be
[1:04:29] stagnant every time you
[1:04:31] worship you have more faith to move
[1:04:36] forward move
[1:04:37] forward
[1:04:39] worship the enemy can take your
[1:04:42] freedom but he can never take your
[1:04:46] worship he can take your
[1:04:48] freedom but he can never take your
[1:04:52] worship God is worship
[1:04:56] let them take everything else
[1:05:00] world but
[1:05:02] never never take your
[1:05:06] worship cuz God is
[1:05:12] worship there's a thought that comes
[1:05:13] into my
[1:05:15] mind don't become a slave to what you
[1:05:20] see don't become a slave to what you
[1:05:23] hear
[1:05:25] because there's freedom in the name of
[1:05:29] Jesus and when God is about to
[1:05:34] move he watches
[1:05:37] us he sees you come to church on
[1:05:40] Sunday you needed a
[1:05:44] breakthrough but you come to church like
[1:05:48] this like a zombie come on zombie not
[1:05:51] zombie but zombie come come zombie
[1:05:55] dead but he wants your
[1:05:57] worship so if you're free here when you
[1:06:01] need
[1:06:02] something he's going to remember your
[1:06:05] worship he's going to give you according
[1:06:07] to your heart's
[1:06:09] desire amen amen don't lose your
[1:06:14] worship so now the children of Israel
[1:06:16] moving
[1:06:18] forward and Moses was not Disturbed at
[1:06:23] all
[1:06:27] he tells them to fear
[1:06:29] not stand
[1:06:32] still you might see your enemy
[1:06:35] today today is going to be the last
[1:06:38] day let's move
[1:06:41] forward and God spoke directly to his
[1:06:46] Prophet we're almost
[1:06:48] there tell your neighbor we're almost
[1:06:50] there still laying down
[1:06:53] Foundation and God always speaks
[1:06:55] directly to his
[1:06:58] Prophet amen amen how many believe we
[1:07:01] have a
[1:07:03] prophet just check him just check
[1:07:06] him God speaks directly to
[1:07:10] him Moses had his eyes on the cloud in
[1:07:13] the pillow of
[1:07:16] fire and the people had their eyes on
[1:07:18] the back of
[1:07:22] Moses and wherever Moses
[1:07:26] moved they
[1:07:28] moved understand what I'm saying here
[1:07:32] don't miss what I'm
[1:07:34] saying if Moses stopped
[1:07:37] here they stopped
[1:07:39] here if Moses began to worship
[1:07:43] here they worship
[1:07:45] there don't forget who Moses
[1:07:48] is brother Bram says in the message this
[1:07:52] great servant Moses
[1:07:56] in
[1:07:58] 1955 January
[1:08:01] 22nd he says
[1:08:04] Moses he was the
[1:08:08] priest he was the
[1:08:10] king and he was the
[1:08:13] lawgiver everything a type of the Lord
[1:08:17] Jesus
[1:08:22] Christ the priest
[1:08:25] the king and the
[1:08:28] lawgiver everything a type of the Lord
[1:08:30] Jesus
[1:08:32] Christ and when the Lord spoke to
[1:08:36] Moses
[1:08:38] Moses spoke

[1:13:10] look I have come down to deliver
[1:13:14] them
[1:13:16] but I'm sending
[1:13:19] you Moses was the Vindicated prophet of
[1:13:23] God
[1:13:25] he was the
[1:13:27] priest he was the king he was the
[1:13:32] lawgiver That's Another Brick we're
[1:13:34] building Brick by Brick
[1:13:36] here we're building a
[1:13:39] pyramid so now we're moving
[1:13:42] forward and God tells Moses to
[1:13:46] rest so what is that mean the children
[1:13:49] of
[1:13:50] Israel have to rest amen between
[1:13:55] what the
[1:13:57] sea and Pharaoh's
[1:14:04] Army Lord I thought you delivered
[1:14:08] us but look what's in front of
[1:14:12] us there's the
[1:14:14] sea and behind us is the it's the
[1:14:19] Army are we going to go into Rapture
[1:14:21] right now
[1:14:24] how
[1:14:28] else God always provides a
[1:14:35] way God
[1:14:37] knows and when ver Exodus
[1:14:42] 14:1 and it says now when Pharaoh Drew
[1:14:47] n the children of Israel lifted up their
[1:14:52] eyes they lifted up their
[1:14:55] eyes and behold the Egyptians marched
[1:14:57] after
[1:14:59] them and they were sore
[1:15:02] afraid and the children of Israel Cried
[1:15:05] Out unto the
[1:15:07] Lord and they were comfortable they were
[1:15:09] comfortable they were
[1:15:10] comfortable but God wanted them to move
[1:15:14] forward finally they recognized
[1:15:17] God and they knew in the mind of the
[1:15:21] Egyptians was more likely to kill them
[1:15:25] all or to take them and bring them back
[1:15:27] into
[1:15:28] cap never let your eyes be the judge of
[1:15:31] the promise that God has for your
[1:15:35] life your
[1:15:37] attention leads to
[1:15:41] adoration so whatever you put your eyes
[1:15:46] to whatever you put your ears
[1:15:49] to is what you begin to adore
[1:15:55] whatever you put your eyes to and ears
[1:15:58] to you begin to
[1:16:01] adore so now you wonder why you're

[1:16:13] with
[1:16:14] loneliness because whatever you put your
[1:16:17] attention
[1:16:18] to begin to
[1:16:21] adore so turn your
[1:16:23] eyes to
[1:16:26] Jesus turn your
[1:16:28] eyes cuz when we pay more attention to
[1:16:32] him he will continue to lift you

[1:16:51] scrolling and then we wonder they
[1:16:53] effects of our actions we wonder about
[1:16:56] the effects of our
[1:17:01] actions so Jesus tells us right if our
[1:17:05] eye causes us to
[1:17:07] sin plug it
[1:17:09] out he was talking about our
[1:17:12] phones that's the
[1:17:15] prophetic because he knows the time

[1:20:33] neighbor we're almost there if they're
[1:20:35] sleeping wake them
[1:20:37] up so now what what's taking
[1:20:42] place is that there is a mixed
[1:20:47] multitude that
[1:20:51] exits so so so the doubt is very strong
[1:20:56] within the
[1:20:59] camp it's not just Believers that are on
[1:21:02] this journey with
[1:21:05] us hello are we still awake this
[1:21:10] morning it's not just believers who are
[1:21:13] on this journey with
[1:21:14] us brother B talks about the three
[1:21:17] kind True Believers make
[1:21:21] believers nonbelievers right so these
[1:21:25] people are walking towards the promised
[1:21:29] land singing the songs of
[1:21:35] Zion they're worshiping and praising and
[1:21:39] adoring true Judas Judah scariot Scot he
[1:21:45] was a Divine
[1:21:47] healer hello
[1:21:50] hello hello hello he was in the presence
[1:21:54] of God
[1:21:56] Almighty and he was healing
[1:21:59] people healing
[1:22:01] people he was doing the work of
[1:22:05] God he slept even close to God
[1:22:09] Almighty everything he was
[1:22:13] doing was according to the gift that he
[1:22:15] was
[1:22:18] given
[1:22:19] everything but the but brother Bram says
[1:22:22] something the prophet say
[1:22:24] something he was a seed of
[1:22:28] discrepancy Google that not Google it
[1:22:30] table it
[1:22:33] tonight in the message seed of
[1:22:37] discrepancy so whatever he was
[1:22:40] doing in the presence of the Mighty
[1:22:44] God it was okay by
[1:22:48] God but as as the enemy was going around
[1:22:55] and all over the Earth are we still
[1:23:00] together the enemy has that power
[1:23:03] too all over the
[1:23:05] Earth he was looking for
[1:23:09] what he was looking for a
[1:23:12] body hello hello just the same way God
[1:23:16] is looking for a
[1:23:18] body Satan was looking
[1:23:21] for a body so now they're sitting here
[1:23:25] at the
[1:23:27] table after they take that last
[1:23:30] supper and he mentioned
[1:23:33] something whatever whoever you want to
[1:23:35] do whoever wants to do
[1:23:37] that do it now the Bible says that the
[1:23:41] spirit entered into do
[1:23:46] this the same one who was a Divine
[1:23:50] healer the same one who walked in talk
[1:23:52] with
[1:23:53] God the same one who paid the ties more
[1:23:56] than
[1:23:57] you the same one who was in church
[1:24:00] first the same one who came to the altar
[1:24:03] every
[1:24:05] day the enemy was looking for a
[1:24:10] body and if your soul is
[1:24:14] empty where is he going to
[1:24:17] go
[1:24:19] inside so you have to fill it
[1:24:23] with
[1:24:26] worship
[1:24:28] always don't dwell on your
[1:24:32] phone it just takes a
[1:24:36] moment it just takes a
[1:24:39] moment so you have no power to judge
[1:24:44] anybody because it just takes one
[1:24:47] seconds for the enemy to just enter
[1:24:50] into you have to be on your
[1:24:54] guard parents teach your children how to
[1:24:58] pray show
[1:25:01] them show
[1:25:03] them I know we have
[1:25:07] jobs I know it's
[1:25:09] hard my dad used to come home at 4: in

[1:25:25] downstairs we come down like
[1:25:28] zombies to let's

[1:25:35] morning did my dad care about our
[1:25:37] feelings at

[1:25:51] Maybe but there was habits he was
[1:25:53] building in
[1:25:56] us there was habits he was building in
[1:26:00] us oh man me when it comes to
[1:26:04] sleep this this God's gift to
[1:26:10] sleep it's a
[1:26:12] gift it's a big gift and my dad would

[1:26:20] time yeah like we come on Sunday
[1:26:23] mornings now that's how I was
[1:26:26] singing
[1:26:30] We're but he was building something in
[1:26:35] us so as we grew
[1:26:38] up we didn't
[1:26:40] forget we didn't
[1:26:43] forget now there's a mixed
[1:26:46] multitude tell your neighbor we're
[1:26:48] almost
[1:26:49] there there's a mixed multitude
[1:26:53] and brother
[1:26:55] Bram
[1:26:56] says this
[1:26:58] thought in
[1:27:00] hearing recognizing and acting on the
[1:27:04] word of
[1:27:06] God
[1:27:08] 1960 February
[1:27:13] 21 take take notes and
[1:27:16] read and listen to these tapes when you
[1:27:18] get a
[1:27:20] chance I promise you I'm not making this
[1:27:24] up paragraph
[1:27:27] 72 he says that whenever there is a
[1:27:33] Revival it always produces
[1:27:39] twins that's a rude
[1:27:42] remark
[1:27:45] that's but it's
[1:27:47] true when there was a birth out of Isaac
[1:27:51] and Rebecca
[1:27:54] It produced
[1:27:56] twins when the world was
[1:27:59] created It produced
[1:28:02] twins two
[1:28:04] trees and when Cain and Abel were
[1:28:08] born It produced
[1:28:10] two when ishma and Isaac was
[1:28:14] born
[1:28:16] two when Esau and Jacob was
[1:28:20] born It produced
[1:28:23] but listen what
[1:28:24] brother oh man I love this
[1:28:27] message one of
[1:28:30] them the
[1:28:31] natural of the
[1:28:34] earth and the other
[1:28:36] one
[1:28:40] supernal and one looked at the
[1:28:44] natural the
[1:28:47] intellectual and the
[1:28:49] other walked by spirit
[1:28:52] it's always been that
[1:28:54] way so now as they're leaving uh
[1:28:58] Egypt there were some who were looking
[1:29:00] at the
[1:29:02] natural and other was looking at the
[1:29:07] superal because a Revival was taking
[1:29:11] place we're almost there and in the
[1:29:14] message Redemption by
[1:29:17] power preached in 1954 March 29
[1:29:23] don't be offended if I'm quoting the
[1:29:27] prophet I'm a young preacher I need
[1:29:33] to paragraph
[1:29:36] 116 he says Jesus said in the parable of
[1:29:42] the
[1:29:44] swer when is so went forth and sold
[1:29:47] seeds and
[1:29:49] some the enemy
[1:29:52] come
[1:29:53] around and sowed some seeds in the
[1:29:59] wheat and what did he
[1:30:02] say let them
[1:30:06] grow you're not God to judge people cuz
[1:30:08] you know someone's life outside a
[1:30:11] church if you're God raise your hand
[1:30:14] here I want to meet
[1:30:16] you thank you when when things are
[1:30:20] happening outside
[1:30:22] you pray for
[1:30:24] them you let them
[1:30:28] grow Moses
[1:30:30] knew he knew that there was a mixed
[1:30:34] multitud Pastor
[1:30:37] knows only Jesus can
[1:30:40] save and the same way he provided for
[1:30:44] you could be a way he provides for
[1:30:48] them don't speak poorly about your
[1:30:50] neighbor
[1:30:53] speak poorly about your
[1:30:56] seatmates pray for them and let them
[1:31:02] grow amen paragraph
[1:31:05] 117 brother brand says you're always
[1:31:07] pointing out how Wicked the world is a
[1:31:12] getting but you fail to
[1:31:16] see how powerful the church is getting
[1:31:20] at the same time
[1:31:24] let them
[1:31:26] grow she is rising up standing on the
[1:31:31] field oh she's a little f
[1:31:34] f but brother God is with her and she's
[1:31:39] going to
[1:31:41] Triumph just as certain as Christ Rose
[1:31:47] from let them
[1:31:50] grow
[1:31:52] God's
[1:31:53] Church shall never fail the Gates of
[1:31:58] Hell will not Prevail against
[1:32:03] it let them
[1:32:06] grow but now the children of
[1:32:09] Israel seem like there's no
[1:32:12] hope heart is full of
[1:32:15] Doubt
[1:32:18] anxiety just one more day Lord oh
[1:32:22] I thought we were free I thought we were
[1:32:26] free and Moses looked towards
[1:32:30] them and as sure as Jesus who rose from
[1:32:32] the
[1:32:36] dead thing he said was fear
[1:32:41] not Moses turns towards the congregation
[1:32:44] of two
[1:32:46] million even with the
[1:32:49] non-believers he says
[1:32:52] fear
[1:32:54] not tell your neighbor fear
[1:32:57] not brother brandham said the trouble
[1:33:00] with the church
[1:33:01] today is that it is scared to death that
[1:33:05] we're going to
[1:33:08] fail how can you fail when you're in
[1:33:13] Christ you can't
[1:33:15] fail you've got everlasting
[1:33:19] life do you believe that
[1:33:23] the fear entered the
[1:33:25] camp but Moses says fear ye
[1:33:29] not stand
[1:33:32] still and see the salvation of the
[1:33:38] Lord he didn't say read about
[1:33:41] it
[1:33:43] no sometimes we read the
[1:33:47] quotes sometimes we hear the healing we
[1:33:49] listen to the
[1:33:50] tapes we hear how the Miracles have
[1:33:54] come how brother Bram would impart that
[1:33:57] gift into the into the
[1:34:00] sanctuary and heal and heal and heal and
[1:34:03] we listen to the
[1:34:05] tape maybe raise our
[1:34:07] hand and go back to our
[1:34:10] life but Moses tells the
[1:34:14] congregation that you're going to
[1:34:16] see the salvation of the
[1:34:19] Lord and I'm telling you this
[1:34:22] morning that you're going to see the
[1:34:25] salvation of the
[1:34:26] Lord so those healings that you hear
[1:34:29] about in
[1:34:32] the it can happen right now you just
[1:34:35] have to
[1:34:36] believe you will see the salvation of
[1:34:39] the
[1:34:40] lord it's not in the
[1:34:43] past it's right
[1:34:46] now you will see the salvation
[1:34:49] of but Moses
[1:34:52] after you tell them to
[1:34:55] fear this is his conference with
[1:34:58] God Moses why are you
[1:35:02] crying Exodus 14:1 15
[1:35:07] Ex we're almost
[1:35:09] there we're almost
[1:35:13] there mes why you
[1:35:16] cry
[1:35:18] speak speak unto the children
[1:35:22] so that they
[1:35:24] go are we reading
[1:35:27] together that they go
[1:35:30] forward
[1:35:31] 16 says
[1:35:35] but we're almost there I
[1:35:38] promise now after you
[1:35:42] spoke
[1:35:44] right build up their
[1:35:47] faith
[1:35:49] then lift up
[1:35:52] thy
[1:35:53] rod so
[1:35:55] now the children of Israel have finally
[1:35:58] put their focus back on the
[1:36:03] prophet they finally put their focus
[1:36:06] back on their
[1:36:08] King priest and their
[1:36:12] lawgiver finally so when he lifts up his
[1:36:18] hand with that rod but the brandham said
[1:36:22] that was not the rod of
[1:36:26] Moses hello hello he said that was the
[1:36:29] rod of
[1:36:31] God the rod of
[1:36:34] judgment why do you think that Rod ate
[1:36:37] the the the the snakes in
[1:36:41] that cuz God is the judge the Supreme
[1:36:45] judge and the same
[1:36:47] Rod that ate those
[1:36:50] snakes mes took it
[1:36:52] again when the children of Israel got
[1:36:55] sick and they looked at the rod
[1:36:58] again and they received their
[1:37:00] healing it's the same Rod it's not
[1:37:05] Moses but
[1:37:09] God and now Moses lifts up the
[1:37:12] rod stretch out thine hand over the
[1:37:16] sea and divide
[1:37:19] it and the children of is is shall go on
[1:37:22] dry ground through the midst of the
[1:37:30] sea on what kind of ground
[1:37:33] John what kind of ground
[1:37:36] dry dry I don't know if you guys have
[1:37:39] ever had water and sand in your
[1:37:44] hands if you get rid of all the
[1:37:47] water what do you have mud
[1:37:51] right or
[1:37:54] right
[1:37:56] but God
[1:37:58] said the ground is going to be
[1:38:02] dry
[1:38:04] what don't miss those Little
[1:38:07] Miracles God is so
[1:38:11] specific oh my dry
[1:38:20] groundy how long would it take to dry
[1:38:24] out Isaac brother Isaac Minister men of
[1:38:29] God how long would it
[1:38:32] take a long
[1:38:36] time Allelujah dry
[1:38:39] ground through the middle of the sea
[1:38:43] 17 and again God says this
[1:38:46] again and I will harden the hearts of
[1:38:50] the Egyptians
[1:38:54] so they shall follow
[1:38:56] them and I will get me honor upon
[1:39:01] pharaoh and upon all of the host all of
[1:39:05] the host all of his
[1:39:08] host upon his
[1:39:10] chariots and his
[1:39:12] Horsemen and the
[1:39:14] Egyptians shall
[1:39:17] know that I am the Lord
[1:39:22] it didn't say Moses said it didn't
[1:39:25] say so the
[1:39:27] Egyptians are recognizing
[1:39:31] something that God is
[1:39:34] Lord in the in the children of
[1:39:37] Israel are
[1:39:39] recognizing that God is
[1:39:42] Lord but they're looking at two
[1:39:44] different
[1:39:48] perspectives the children of Israel are
[1:39:51] looking
[1:39:53] at the
[1:39:56] prophet are we are we
[1:39:59] together and the Israelites are looking
[1:40:01] at the children
[1:40:04] of but who's getting the
[1:40:07] glory the
[1:40:10] lord Through The Eyes of pharaoh I will
[1:40:12] receive my glory and
[1:40:16] honor upon his
[1:40:18] chariots upon his
[1:40:22] Horsemen tell your neighbor we're almost
[1:40:25] there this is where all this inspiration
[1:40:29] came

[1:40:36] God which went before the camp of
[1:40:41] Israel

[1:40:53] cloud

[1:41:05] what it went before their
[1:41:09] face and stood behind
[1:41:13] them wait is that
[1:41:17] possible is that
[1:41:19] possible so this this pillar of the
[1:41:24] cloud

[1:42:30] of the
[1:42:31] cloud went before their
[1:42:33] face and stood behind them he says or
[1:42:38] went
[1:42:40] up from here and stood back
[1:42:44] there a go
[1:42:47] between in the
[1:42:49] time of trouble
[1:42:52] there is a light that stands in the
[1:42:57] Gap that is the same light that is here
[1:43:01] today if you accept it if you
[1:43:05] believe brother B says in 132 paragraph
[1:43:08] 132 you're there you're there paragraph
[1:43:12] 132 we're almost there tell you we're
[1:43:14] almost
[1:43:15] there when trouble begins to face
[1:43:18] you sickness on every
[1:43:22] trouble the angel of God comes up and
[1:43:27] goes out between you and the
[1:43:33] sickness and stands there in the
[1:43:38] way every
[1:43:41] sickness there's no name didn't say
[1:43:43] cancer it didn't say sugar diabetes
[1:43:45] every
[1:43:47] sickness every
[1:43:49] sickness and it stands in the
[1:43:52] way cancer where are you
[1:43:55] going cancer where are you
[1:43:58] going and he stands in the Gap and he
[1:44:02] fights for you but he's providing a
[1:44:06] way because what's in front of the
[1:44:08] children of
[1:44:09] Israel is the
[1:44:12] sea they're still
[1:44:17] stuck but God needed to do something
[1:44:19] spectacular
[1:44:22] H it's always that last
[1:44:25] second when he shows
[1:44:33] up were
[1:44:37] there praise our God or burning the
[1:44:43] fire praise him or burning the
[1:44:47] fire we'll put you in prison for a long
[1:44:50] time
[1:44:52] they didn't
[1:44:54] stop because God is
[1:44:56] worship so every day they praised God
[1:44:58] and they prayed they
[1:45:01] fasted they didn't eat with the food
[1:45:03] that the other people
[1:45:05] ate separated
[1:45:08] themselves with the
[1:45:11] word and now when it's
[1:45:14] time puts the fire to the
[1:45:17] kill seven times harder than any time
[1:45:25] fire like no
[1:45:27] other and then he asked him just one
[1:45:29] more
[1:45:33] time bow down to
[1:45:38] me and they
[1:45:40] say no
[1:45:43] way so now as they're walking into the

[1:45:55] talk to one
[1:45:57] another hey bro you you prayed up you

[1:56:55] minutes up
[1:56:57] north and I'm going to church that
[1:57:00] Sunday February 2nd
[1:57:08] 2020 and and I'm hearing the screaming
[1:57:10] and it did something
[1:57:13] to and I couldn't figure it
[1:57:18] out and I'm driving as fast as I
[1:57:22] can cuz they texted me just come
[1:57:25] home just come home on my way to
[1:57:30] church and I couldn't figure it
[1:57:33] out so I'm
[1:57:35] driving and I'm just going through just
[1:57:38] every thought in the
[1:57:40] world all all this regret all this pain
[1:57:43] and know something is
[1:57:45] wrong know
[1:57:47] it and I get home
[1:57:50] to my parents
[1:57:52] house screaming in the
[1:57:54] background and my my sister comes
[1:57:59] outside and she
[1:58:01] says am I died in a
[1:58:05] sleep my brother died and
[1:58:11] sleep 20 26 years
[1:58:15] old and his
[1:58:17] sleep peaceful
[1:58:21] but God has a funny way of showing
[1:58:26] still I was
[1:58:28] there couldn't figure I
[1:58:30] I no thoughts no emotions
[1:58:34] nothing I felt
[1:58:37] empty felt
[1:58:40] broken I didn't believe
[1:58:42] it we drove up
[1:58:45] to and I went to the
[1:58:48] room and I I saw him there
[1:58:52] his no
[1:58:55] breath
[1:58:57] nothing and it became real to
[1:59:01] me but still
[1:59:04] more we went
[1:59:08] downstairs and we prayed and we
[1:59:12] worshiped with tears coming
[1:59:16] down the enemy canot
[1:59:20] Take My
[1:59:21] Worship amen even though I witnessed
[1:59:25] that with my own
[1:59:29] eyes my best
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:33] friend the enemy can't take your
[1:59:38] worship and I left there as low as I
[1:59:42] could have ever
[1:59:45] been two a week
[1:59:48] later I'm trying to drive to
[1:59:51] work a little
[1:59:53] snowstorm I'm driving up a
[1:59:56] hill my car does a
[2:00:00] 360 and then a car comes towards
[2:00:06] me and I get out of the car not even one
[2:00:10] scratch on my
[2:00:13] body because I know that God Is Watching
[2:00:17] Over Us
[2:00:20] and the enemy cannot take my
[2:00:24] wor it did not slow me
[2:00:27] down the reason why I can even hold this
[2:00:32] today is because of that pain I
[2:00:36] experience God has a funny way of making
[2:00:41] us draw closer
[2:00:44] to wow wow sometimes he breaks you
[2:00:50] sometimes he bruises
[2:00:51] you it did him good to bruise his
[2:00:55] son so that you can
[2:00:58] live if you want an
[2:01:02] anointing you need
[2:01:04] oil and how do you get
[2:01:06] oil pressing
[2:01:11] pring and now I can stand here
[2:01:14] today knowing that he is still God
[2:01:19] and I didn't lose my
[2:01:22] hope I can't even slow
[2:01:25] down I'm even going faster
[2:01:29] now he's still God and he knows your
[2:01:34] pain he knows everything you've
[2:01:37] experienc he understands all of those
[2:01:41] things and he's
[2:01:43] ready he's
[2:01:46] willing take you to the promised land
[2:01:50] only
[2:01:52] believe and verse
[2:01:54] 20 tell your neighbor we're almost

[2:02:01] weaker God where's the body change you
[2:02:04] guys become younger again body
[2:02:08] change verse 20 it says and it came
[2:02:12] between the camp of the
[2:02:14] Egyptians and the camp of
[2:02:16] Israel and it was a cloud
[2:02:19] CL of
[2:02:21] Darkness to them to them who is it a
[2:02:26] cloud of Darkness
[2:02:28] to who are we still
[2:02:32] here to the
[2:02:34] Egyptians the same
[2:02:37] light that was a
[2:02:39] light to the
[2:02:42] Israelites was the same light that was a
[2:02:45] cloud of
[2:02:47] Darkness
[2:02:49] Egyptians because God was working on
[2:02:54] something because to separate the
[2:02:59] sea to lift the
[2:03:01] sea and to dry the
[2:03:05] ground it was going to take some
[2:03:08] time
[2:03:10] right but it gave
[2:03:13] light by night to
[2:03:17] these so that the one came not near to
[2:03:21] the other all
[2:03:25] night the Egyptians couldn't see
[2:03:29] anything but the light was
[2:03:32] shining in the evening
[2:03:35] time the light shall
[2:03:37] come so the same light that you see
[2:03:40] through this
[2:03:43] Revelation you can read these
[2:03:46] words you can listen to the tape and it
[2:03:49] does something to
[2:03:50] you but someone else can listen to these
[2:03:54] words and listen to the
[2:03:57] tape
[2:04:00] Darkness cuz in the evening time the
[2:04:03] light will
[2:04:04] come
[2:04:06] God is not the author of
[2:04:09] confusion God will bring
[2:04:13] Darkness to the enemies who was chasing
[2:04:16] after you and create
[2:04:21] separation with the same
[2:04:25] light you have the
[2:04:27] light walk in the
[2:04:29] light beautiful
[2:04:32] light Jesus the light of the world so
[2:04:36] you march forward you march
[2:04:39] forward and

[2:05:17] work and the Lord caused the
[2:05:22] sea to go back to be pushed
[2:05:26] back by a strong East
[2:05:29] Wind and made the sea dry
[2:05:33] land and the waters were
