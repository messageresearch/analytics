had some couple people in from Illinois for work and before they left we went to have lunch and Lord gave me a word of knowledge regarding one of them didn't know if it was them or a loved one or their family or a friend and and even called it out by name it was a cancer of prostrate cancer and the one brother from across the table said wha I don't know how you would have known that other than God showed you he said that's my friend Larry's got prostrate cancer and so we just had a lovely time right there in a restaurant to pray for Larry and it was just how God touching those both of those gentlemen were just really opened them up and just their desire for the Lord and so I'm just very thankful for that he's he's a God of knowledge and he will give us that he will give us the wisdom so

eyes with me there's no terse thing for the things of the world they've taken wings long ago I give them up and instantly all my not was turned today all my burdens rolled away now the comforter abides with me oh I'm rejoicing night in there as I walked in there away for the [Music] comforting night indeed as I walked never way for the comforter hides with me amen I'm so glad tonight that the comforter abides oh he's a faithful friend not prolonging the time we're just going to go right into the Word of God he abides with me we're gonna be coming by the grace of God from st. John glad to see everybody here tonight my wife couldn't make it she's babysitting now the shoving off kids brother Adam and his little fella Nehemiah is at home with the flu and so my wife has the other three kids at the house pray that God give them speedy recovery polio fellas I tell you but God designed everything and he makes no mistakes we love the Lord and we appreciate God amazing grace I was just talking with our precious brother you know tonight and when we think about how good God is to us I still when I get to heaven you know we say we know you know we were in him from the foundation of the world and there's still questions you know you come to the factory and you think you know Lord why me how did I get there how did I become this and you know it amazes me because the more I see my faults and my failures the more I see his glory and the more I want to be more like it so let's turn to st. John 17 1 through 5 and then we're to read st. John 12 to 13 and then we'll skip down to st. John 17 20 24 I believe that we often have a tendency of looking in the future even as the prophet of God says looking in the past but we fail to see what God is doing present day and even though it looked like God is not doing anything perhaps to some eye I see the glory of God every day I see the mercies of God every day I see his long-suffering I see his grace not looking out on my window but looking in I see what God and how incredible he is Saint John 17 one through five these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know the only we got of the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on earth I have finished the work which thou gave me to do and now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the foundation but before the world was I want you to take note Jesus Christ is saying by how that he has done his work you know Paul talks about it he says you know I have finished my course I've kept the faith and Paul was still living had not died yet but it we have a tendency of we should have as I put this way this should be an instruction even though we don't see the finishing line we must confess we have finished you know Jesus said I have kept it I finished I've glorified the work is done and yet Calvary was still before John 17 12 13 while I was with them in the world I kept them in their name those that thou gave it to me I have kept and none of them is lost but the Sun perdition that the Scriptures might be fulfilled and now come I to D and these things I spake in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves so you and I must know that that one of Christ's purposes one of his finished works it was to fulfill his joy or let his jaw be fulfilled in us in other words being full of his joy all right st. John 17 22 24 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave with me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I in them Darwyn me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as they love me father I will that also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me but thou loveth me before the foundation of the world let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves I pray tonight that you would bless the service anoint your servant Lord forgive us of all our sins I trespassers are thoughts desires everything Lord and anything that have not been pleasing in that sight forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness father we give you all the glory we give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated the subject tonight is long and pretty much the glory of the Lord is now being revealed you know when we talk about glory we more than likely think of something that is bliss something that is of a splendor something that is from heaven we think about the pillar far above brother branham's head that ring that circle that surrounding radiant light that represents the head the whole figure of a Jesus Christ person and it amazes me because even in the old pictures of those who were considered saints of God they they always put that glow that light about the head then it showed that that person was an extraordinary person yet maybe a common person but extraordinary in the sense that he was able or she was able to reflect God and even the world or their neighborhood so those who did not know them looked upon them as being Christians or Saints now they weren't here to glorify themselves but the glory that was reading being revealed was the glory that God had given them and you and I have come to do one thing and that is to glorify God in this evil age you and I must realize by God's grace that the glory that we have in the glory that we will receive is that glory that was given to us before the foundation of the world it is not a man's achievement it's a god appointment it is something that God himself has established in his own thoughts in his own mind before the world existed it is something that we I like to use this word will evolve into you know we we see ourselves as men but you and I must understand that we're not two continuous men our thoughts are not supposed to be thoughts of man but our thoughts are supposed to be thoughts of God and even the Bible tells us that we should let the mind that was in Christ Jesus being us you have heard me say before Jesus Christ was the perfect man he was the perfect Adam he was the perfect one he was the perfect God even though he was a man I love Jesus because jesus wept Jesus alone Jesus groan Jesus got sick and he never failed to call upon his father he realized his frailties he understood that everything that he had was not his own as a man he realized amen that everything that was given was given all that the father has given you were given by God to who we call Jesus Christ now don't think I'm confused because I don't believe in two gods I don't believe in three I know there's only one God but I understand the dispensations of God I understand amen the manifestations of God and if the disciples and if the prophets and you know the Apostles can can talk about the father of Jesus Christ so can I and you and I must understand by God's grace that this thing was laid up this way so that we can understand what we're coming to now if Adam and Eve had not faulted they had not fallen we would have come right into that sonship we would have not needed to be adopted we would have been born already into what that position in which God had in his mind for us to be but because of the fall we understand by God's grace amen that we are now - how could I say God uses us to walk in walks of faith because you understand faith must be established not your faith his faith because we realized that because of the lack of faith in what God has said to Adam and Eve it is the reason why we're in this position so that faith in God God's faith must first be established before anything else it is the foundation of the gospel he that cometh to God must believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him what glorious you speaking of there's only one really one glory and that glory is the glory of God now we realize by God's grace in this world we have many gods whether they be basketball gods football gods gambling gods whatever they got of many gods everywhere but the glory in which they obtained in this world is not everlasting and you asked who was the Pharaoh and so and so on so time and then you know nobody remembers who he was and yet is still in his day he was glorified as a God is that right but it is so amazing that who those whom God established as gods never fade they're always talked about now you may not look at it like that but God says even is it not written in your scriptures that God says ye are gods he told Moses he said Moses you're going to be God unto Pharaoh in other words at the end of the day they will bow to you now we realized the whole thing that God was doing and all he was doing is like what animals do if I could say like this in the natural animals teach their young they teach them how to hunt lions teach lions how to hunt how to approach porcha how are you pronounce it but we realized by God's grace they're taught that's why God says train your children teach them bring them up in the way what way the god-given way to understand that we will yes sinners saved by grace but this is not our stopping place we're not things that just happened we don't we don't we don't evolve by Darwin's Darwin's theory but you and I must understand that we are purposely brought here and we are to purposely fulfill God's will now you say well what I mean but it takes a surrendering did you know that Jesus Christ being the son of God had to surrender his everyday life was surrendering to the will of the Father can you imagine this person full of God and seeing all the afflicted ones yet he had to pass by some and stop by others think about all that he knew a man at the Pool of Bethesda how that he there were many afflicted there but Jesus Christ bypassed him all a had healed a man with an infirmity he wasn't that it he couldn't walk but he was sick he could have had kinds of things going on with him but he wasn't the worst case scenario and God passed by all of the others I heard brother Brennan said they would even come to the Pool of Bethesda with knives to fight each other off to see who could get into the pool first yeah and I thought wow that would be the that's exactly but yeah I want God to bless me but I'm gonna kill you so he can bless me but you see people were desperate in that day they needed healing gave me to deliverance and then when the real delivery came by they were they watch him pass by I don't know what they were thinking but I think to myself if I had seen him there and he says to this man take up your bed and walk and that man got up and walked he would have had to deal with me too because how to follow them where every whit go but somehow the scripture doesn't even say that no one else got excited pretty much you look at these things and you and I must understand by God's grace that when God every time God became a mystery to the world he always sent a voice every time when when when the miracles the signs and the wonders of God would disappear and Men intelligence would increase and and their knowledge would come to a place where they felt like they needed didn't need God God would always raise up a standard the Bible tells us he never left himself without a witness understand now when God reveals his glory everybody won't see it they don't see it it is only those who are due to see it y'all heard me everybody won't see the reality of this message they may read it they may study it they may walk too but it's not given to those who want to it's not him that willeth it's not him that runneth but it's God who shows mercy and you and I should be screaming sometime to the top of our voice because of God who has opened our eyes to see and has caused a life to come in us listen even your desire to serve God is from God you didn't make up your mind God made up your mind for you I think about the man who was blind and the question was asked who did sin and Jesus says they said did his parents his father and mother he says neither but all this was done for the glory of God hallelujah y'all gotta understand you didn't ask to be in later seer you did not ask God amen to be here but it was given to you to be here for the glory of God you and I need to understand we need not to complain we need not to be discouraged we need not it meant to think why am I here because God brought you here that his glory might be seen through you in this wicked age don't tell me it's easy I don't know what the Eve's before me had to deal with but I'm gonna tell you something it is a battleground every day that'll keep me he keeps me I don't know how to keep myself hello I must understand I'm being kept for his own purpose he understand me you said what do you mean brother was did you and you remember the time in the scripture when Peter took the sword and he tried to cut the head of the man off and got his ear God I could have left it that way Peter would have been thrown in jail more than likely crucified and would have missed Pentecost but God had a purpose for him the devil knew he meant that Peter had already been given the keys to the New Testament church and God for random God God saw what the devil was doing put that man's ear and got rid of all the evidence hallelujah and that's how it is with God when it comes to you the Bible says no weapon formed against me or you shall prosper no I don't care if it's all one it will never prosper it'll never get victory over you even at the time when it seems like it has victory over you God says not so this is truth you and I we are the glory of God being revealed every test and trial you go through God is expecting you to come out as a winner ah so that his glory would be seen you've got to understand you and I will will will I come with regards God's army on the chessboard Satan against God I'm God already five or seven steps ahead at five or seven you know me in there and you know God knows who the winner is and sometimes you know the devil might put a little play on and it looked like he got God in a checkmate and God put a move on him huh gotta put a move on him amen and bring him to shame because his he was being overconfident sometimes saying I really think he's the winner he's a prideful o devil and he thinks men with all of the things that he places on us he's gonna win he cannot win it's not in the script you and I are not representing ourselves we're here representing God we are ambassadors of Jesus and all of heaven is above above us is with us and for us God will make your life come out right there is no trap Satan God cannot break so look through the scripture every trap Satan set for the believer God came around and broke it they could have been ensnared and traps for years but at that appointed time God comes around and shows his glory oh you talking about what are you talking about you see even Rahab didn't even know she was a believer until that time came she realized she was a believer and though she was a believer she couldn't deliver herself hey it's about it and because you are believer doesn't mean you can deliver you have no ability to deliver yourself it is Christ Jesus alone who is Dodd deliver rock is that right Bo's is whether the deliverer it was God in Moses who was the deliverer you're not a deliverer is God in you who is the deliverer hallelujah but God puts us in easy so he's a he's a the captain he's the captain of the laws holes you know god is great in battle and he uses us to bring in it to a visitor visibility of what he's doing in the unseen world you and I must understand by God's grace that God knows exactly what he's doing you understand me listen I don't care what situation you in right now think about it God allowed it to be so hello why he knows you better than you know yourself he knows that there is no quitting in you he knows that at the end of the day something will go to snap you to your senses is that right it looked like God chose a bad person when he chose Samson cause Samson and that's right when he was first born and all Samson did look like was a mess up job messed up all the time hmm did a few exploits right but at the same time at the end of the day what happens when the devil thought he had Samson all tired of God came and unloosed and not broke the chain yeah I'm saying in other words there is no way you and I if you have been chosen to be bride there is no way you can miss it God will work nature to bring you to that place he'll make the winds move the trees he got quake he'll do whatever is necessary to put you in a place where his glory is revealed now sometimes we think glory is the praise and worship of God of a man excuse me when we think about glory we think about all these things but you must understand Paul didn't live didn't die in a bad way Paul went to Nero's chopping block huh and he was glorifying God yeah when you think about it he went you see a lot of time we think it's gonna be all this Fame and this beauty no no no no no take up your cross and follow me we are glorifying God by way and through the cross Yuri was suffer hallelujah but in that suffering we love him we believe him we trust him hallelujah because and then we have a relationship with him that's unexplainable he looked at old death in his day in his eyes as a old death whereas you're staying o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives me the victory to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it looked like a horrible death they take all that Paul had done Paul says everybody has forsaken me even my buddy Dimas is gone I don't have nobody with me I preach this gospel all these years and where are the comforts and then I see amen through these prophetic eyes that after I leave grievious was going to come in and the whole thing that I've worked for and men would come to annul it seems but Paul says God shows him at the end of the day this coming another group coming up hallelujah this seed must go into the ground it must die it must rot it must go through a dark period hallelujah but in the evening time there shall be light so how can we expect to be any otherwise different you and I must understand when you chose to be a Christian you have chose you chose the hard way this way is not an easy way if it's easy you backslash lid this is a rough way hallelujah ridicule rejected you're going to be rejected if the world loves you something's wrong if all means be good of you something's wrong we're not here it meant to please men or to make them happy we're here to glorify God and what that takes if you got to walk alone you have to walk alone one of the things that we are overlooking in this message and I'm not going to be long tonight but first John 3:11 says for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another and I think sometimes we think loving one another's being buddies and friends I think sometimes we take that love that he's talking about as some kind of a filial love he's not talking about that he's talking about that divine love that that was from the beginning huh and that's why I said don't go in love love like Cain and ain't King versus Abel that wasn't love that was jealousy and Cain killed his brother and so he says no if you love one another like you don't go around killing one another hello we can't kill with the gun but we can kill with the tongue and you and I must understand by God's grace this is the message hey hey hey somebody help me here here see because faith is just a foundation that'll take you up to love and none of those virtues can be sealed without it you can't have long-suffering or patient with anybody someone that you don't love you gotta love in order to see be sealed with patience even the unlovable y'all sir ma'am you know I'm enjoying myself I'm not just running around right now but I'm really enjoying myself because you and I we was realized Amen we're taking steps of faith like I was telling a young brother today you have to call those things that be not as though they were you can't expect amen a positive result out of winner your confession is negative negative chisel baguettes negative yes you know you got to realize that man in order for this to be to explode for you this message you know your life I don't care how the devil make you trip how many times he make you fall I'm bride Oh Lord I just don't know who I am and what I am what what you can't speak those things out of your mouth God can't work with that God only works with faith it ain't what you do is what he's done you're trying to tell him he's not done enough he's done more than enough he's completed it but he needs somebody someone like you and me uh who's gonna believe what he's done we got to believe it but hey I don't care if I make a mistake right now I'm perfect ha he called me perfect I'm sanctified why he sanctified me i sanctified them through the truth hallelujah I know the truth what truth I was with him before the foundation of the world I was in him before the foundation the world his life is holy and so his mind hey you said oh but it ain't there yet it is you said what do you mean because in his time he makes all things beautiful your life is going to be beautiful at the end of the day uh-huh I don't think I don't think I don't think grayham says wait a minute Lord when she crossed over I don't think she says well Lord I just did I just don't even understand why you let me go that way because she says listen I have a book out there now you know I'm an author you know and a finisher and I have a book now and guess what you live the rough life and half of the stories that think you've gone through wasn't even written but I got people who are now being inspired when they see what I did with you it gives him hope it gives him safe yeah when I look at doubting Thomas you know I'm encouraged by Thomas because he was real he didn't put on a fair chic facade he was real probably more real than all the rest that was in that room unless I put my hand in his side and thrust my fingers into his room I'm not gonna believe it hello and God come to his rescue God could have said wait a minute this guy he's a tough character he's got some heavy issues everybody else is believing pretty much and yet he speaks this out of his mouth no God didn't say that you know why cuz the blood had already been shared for him he was already covered it allows his confession meant nothing to God because God knew he was God knew that the devil was inspiring him the devil was anointing him and all you had to do is come and see see it's okay when you haven't seen God move it's okay because God is able to show you he's able to come and move on your behalf he will you're no different from Thomas at times we all have those moments when difficult times things calm hallelujah people said well if you got cancer just believe don't you know that even faith that kind of faith comes from God you can believe it all you vote but until it drops in your heart by revelation that demon ain't moving he don't move when your revelation is in the head he only moves when it drops to the heart cuz winners in the heart it's gonna show I love it the way Peter Newman and I'm showing how the glory of God so I'm bringing it I'm trying to get y'all to see here your suffering is not in vain what you and I are going through these trials and tribulations you you think yourself Lord how did I get here ain't because you've been so sinful if that be the case all of us would be wiped out and listen we understand sinful now it's just not believing it ain't all the fruits of it it's just not believing and who's going to give you faith who can you give you faith and Jesus said Amen in the scriptures when the Son of man shall come shall he find faith and when the Son of man came did he find it brother Branham had to work hard to get the people to believe that angel said if you can get the people to believe all things are possible so evidently they won't believe us even though they confessed to be believers many time Balaban said there were prostitution that came through the line that got their healing and people who claimed me Christian walked away without it because they thought faith was some kind of emotion they thought faith was jumping and speaking in tongues no sir faith is a revelation that God has already done it not for somebody else for me for you is this okay listen the riches of God and that's what God wants us to see his riches his glory to know that there is no boundaries you know what that's what Paul says that the death of the height the death the width of Brent he wants us to see all of him as much as possible see at all I am God and if you can see that I can do something with you regardless to who you are regardless of what state you find yourself in it's the people who think less of themselves who God can use when you come to a place where you think you something God can use you but when you realize you ain't nothing God can use you that's where the glory of the Lord is in that individual a man who don't really think much of himself all he do is old war with me Lord or war with me I'm so unworthy of your glory not all I've done this I've done that I've done this God can't use that when you humble yourself and don't get me wrong I'm preaching on the anointing of the Holy Spirit sometimes we all get in a place where we think we're something when we're nothing we don't realize we're thinking that way but some it's easy for flesh to get up but I think I'll for the keeper God always knows how to take the air out of the balloon humble the end of it y'all know what I'm saying have you ever been humbled by God oh absolutely absolutely you love the Lord give me a few more minutes hallelujah second Thessalonians 2 13 through 15 says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth so when the devil tells you you can't be Saint if I take him to the scripture he chosen me to be sanctified so I am will be done y'all hear me you got to work with the word and if you don't see it today tomorrow is the saying you keep speaking write and gotta make it right it is our tongues that makes us backslide you know we speak things and then you know it puts because heat God hears you hallelujah remember the time when God told Israel cross over the Jordan and I think it was it so many tribes that says oh we can't do this because we this is that this in that net and Gaza okay because you confess this this is what's going to happen to you see when you confess things that's not right with the word those are the things that happens to you hello fear is torment but faith can move mountains is this okay oh you and I must understand our life is supposed to like be like the life of Jesus now we think about first John I'm gonna read this to you first time 1 1 through 4 and here amen he's speaking a word I love this portions of Scripture because he says that which from was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life do you think he was talking about a scroll he was talking about Jesus Christ John said we've seen the world manifest we have heard him we have seen him we have handled him you know I still wonder how it must have felt with John laying in the bosom of Jesus all that an auntie oh my god you take a pill of coffee he did wouldn't been able to do it but you know it's amazing how let me say this because that Holy Ghost want me to say God has called us to rest he called he has called us to rest we're not resting in him hello the says God would grant us perfect peace if we keep our mind stared on him we're not resting come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest we're not supposed to be tolling the way we're Tarly God wants us to rest labor to enter into his rest and once you get into his rest stay there right is that all right is that all right remember the little rabbit running running from the wolf I believe it what it was what it was and he saw that look crack in the rock he ran into the rock right or the dogs what it was he ran into that into that rock and where he was at rest but the dogs couldn't get there he could see the dogs the dogs could smell him the dogs knew he was in there but he was sheltered by the rocks just that little crack in that rock right the birdie meant when the store was raging that bird was in the clefts of the rock that bird could smell it see it and everything else that when he was there singing that song resting it doesn't mean that you're not gonna have trials it's not good it doesn't mean you're not gonna have tests you'll see it you could probably feel it amen but at the same time you're resting let me ask you a question what happens when death comes we're not here to fight death God is already falling the victory is already won we're supposed to scream out like power o death where is your sting hey come on death bring me my chariot see you don't when you see people about to die they rasping that being something ain't right you don't you know when you resting in God and death comes on you you just speaking positive amen oh you're looking like okay I'm waiting for those curtains to uh not too loose for me I want to see whether but we look at these things and we don't see the glory of it how blessed it's gonna be when you realize really realize that you have believed the truth it's all to the glory of God your whole life is to the glory of God do you know God allows you to make mistakes but he also allows you to correct them hey let me say it like this when brother branham lied to those people who was coming out to him for the taxes he lied here's a man who God has used with healing eyes of the blind open deaf ear stopped all kinds of miracles and he lied a big one God allowed it but then that man came around and repented and went back to that man and says listen I'm sorry I told my wife they say I wasn't at home and I was there that man said I know you truly are a man of God now you understand me well he was perhaps you know and probably the devil was probably trying to skin him you know to me you a man of God and you don't need this net now you got to go confess of that man that you and what he's gonna think about you afterwards who cares who cares as long as you make it right who cares the glory of God is now being revealed in you that's when people really know you're a real Christian when you can make things right it is okay I'm almost done may the Lord Jesus the holy son of God who I believe with all my heart to the Jehovah made manifest in the flesh I believe him to be the god of Emmanuel that cometh down from glory and formed himself into a body of flesh called the Son of God that y'all understand his father's glory that I you and I had from the beginning I now give them to this glory to them glory is seen glory is not something unseen glory is seen whether it be a radiant light or just a manifestation of a life it is seen come on y'all know even in track when that God break the record that was before him what happened he received glory he's now the head of this --trackevent thing or a man that can't just so many footballs oh yeah I'm just using these natural scenarios because I want you understand he didn't get this glory by sitting on the bench it was worth hardwork submitting to hours of laboring and working hard and you know causing physical pain just to get glory that's what they do in the natural what about us where's the sacrifice where's the hard work can we compare ourselves to the early big Christians where we standing I was telling brother Troy's as I I said I hear about those these men beforehand weren't prophets but they yet they want a million souls to Christ where's the crown where's our stars what has happened at what point in time God would glow be glorified in us are a wit you know you reason why he cannot be when you know I heard brother Aaron says if the love of the world is in you he said if you still love the world he said you're not even a Christian and you and I must understand that God is trying to get all these things out of us but we must surrender I'm closing how many of us want God's glory to be seen in us I do I don't want to be like everybody else I don't want to be you don't hurt me say this many times I don't want to be just call her a message preacher I what that means to me I just wanted if the Lord should to ever take my life I want to be known as a true son of God I want to leave that witness behind me they have seen God in me you understand me you know it is what we should be striving toward more God less of me more God none of me and that's what our footsteps should be walking toward that and guess what where the glory of Jesus Christ was really seen that cow and that was not easy that was when it was the hardest oh he had fared 10,000 fed 5000 excuse me and you know there's so many more and raised the dead but with him as a man Pressey agonizing to bring the will of God to pass he had done everything else but he wanted this was the hardest of all things to die to himself and the hardest thing you have to do is to die Jesus laid in that tomb excuse me in that guard and he laid there and he cried out cried out he kept crying out so much so he was so weak the Bible said God dispatched an angel to strengthen him his his his the intensity of it said that his sweat was like drops of blood but he had one purpose in mind not my will but thine be done may God help us may God help me that God's glory may be seen he does it in ways sometimes if we're not careful we'll miss it he doesn't always blow the horn he said look at me no sometime it's so simple as that boy brother Troy brought up this evening he says we get over there and says Lord when did we do these things sometime it's not always visible not even to us but it's known we keep our self in the way God can do whatever he wants to do and at the end of the day he'll show it all to you but we least want to be in that place where God I want him to be glorified and I don't know how y'all feel how everybody's going through and what you're going through but I put it this way I disappoint him every day but I keep praising him every day I keep worshiping him every day because let me say it like this you either sinning cold or omission either what willfully are not knowing me that you're doing something wrong and I'm gonna tell you something like this without the blood of Jesus Christ none of us would make it and we and you and I must understand at the end of the day Jesus Christ says I've never lost one and all I am is one so he never lost me he never lost you he never will lose you but yeah you understand me the devil can take your salvation your salvation is certain brother and says that he said but what you do with your salvation he says right now if you're doing something wrong and you you've got you saved you're saved but think about what you did with your save life at the end of day when they giving out rewards don't be surprised at the end of the day you want to make sure that you're doing whatever you can do you know what I'm saying to please him at the day he'd give me the reward but you do want some rewards somebody lost son and I in closing my son and I were talking I said time and chance happens to everybody everybody in this world have usually have an opportunity of bettering themselves no matter where they are I don't care if they were born in a ghetto it doesn't mean they got to stay there because God will give them that opportunity somewhere down the road he'll make a door for them now whether they change that door or not is up to them y'all think Hollywood got the best singers in the world know do you really think Hollywood got the Prius women in the world forget it because that that those women they got out there that's beautiful is all maxfactor you know what the Priya's women are in this message it's the truth why because they have a natural you know we're the most intelligent men are in this in this world to buy but they yeah in this message and I'm saying like this you know my mama couldn't read all right and I brag on that I do you know why cuz because she couldn't read or write she had sense enough to believe that the word she had more wisdom than they the man with a doctor degree she knew the word was right she lived it I saw in her and I like I said this is good don't get me wrong the Bible is right we supposed to read it we supposed to study it amen and we supposed to love it but don't you know there's a lot of people who so-called love God won't make it except the moment man is born again they're people who love this word study it far more better than and they have such a intellectual thing but it's not dad it comes by revelation is that right where was it in the script when God told Joshua march around Jericho he had no letter there was nothing written in the law but the woman with the issue of blood who told her there was no letter it was inspiration something given by God and I'm not taking away from the letter I'm not taking away from the word but just like brother Branham said and the Bible says this gospel doesn't come by intellectualism the gospel is not the word only power and demonstration I don't care how the people in this message all the word the word the word that mean a thing to me demonstrate it let's see God operate let's see the glory of God in your lives and every one of us in here has a testimony don't don't shortchange yourself you've seen the supernatural don't short change yourself because the deficit whoa you've never seen you know the Red Sea open or the Jordan River dry up or whatever the case may be but you had your own I tell somebody any day I seen God dismantle something I don't know how he did it but my wife and I was coming by way of Chicago and and there was three cars and we were all getting ready to hit each other and I don't know whether we passed through I don't know I blinked and my wife and we were on and they were gone now you explained that to be many others see stuff that doesn't you know naturally it shouldn't have happened you should be dead or something and God did it you love the Lord you're the glory of God remember that Satan gonna make you sit over you ain't nothing you ain't this night say yeah but I'm here to praise God you that's how you can tell you when the man or woman love God because when you going through some hard times and you say praise God anyhow I love him anyhow and like joe said though he slay me I'm gonna trust him in it hallelujah I'm not gonna be selfish and prideful and arrogant like Satan I'm gonna be humble I'm gonna thank the Creator he is my Creator he is your Creator I'm gonna give him the glory hello no matter what I go through that Stan give him the glory people he's worthy of all to take something that is unclean and make it clean just saying take something that is broken and cracked up and beat and whatever and then make it home fix it hmm to take a person think about you you and I we've been a work garden had a lot of loan suffering a lot of patience to get us where we are we didn't just jump in and got there God had we went through a lot of falls and failures and then when God decided to move us to her next level he did hello not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord we are who we are because of the mercies and grace of God Father we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy try to take my tie on this evening Lord I thank you for the words that's been spoken lord I pray that if there be any arrogance or any pride in me Father please remove remove Lord and Lord I don't want ever be shy and testifying about you to whoever and to whomever no matter what Lord I want to be able to glorify you with my lips as well as my life father help us all it's a pressing time it's a pressing time Lord and just listening to the message letting off the pressure brother branham said it it he this pressure is on everybody doesn't matter whether you're rich doesn't matter whether you're good doesn't matter whether you're bad this pressure is on everybody and father we know by God's grace that we will and cannot handle the pressure without you help us now many of us are going through all kinds of things whether it be mentally physically or spiritually but we know from whence I help come and I help comes from you Lord you are the I am the clay and you are the Potter Lord mold us and make us step by step take us through this journey forgive us Lord for all of our shortcomings cleanse us from all our unrighteousness may we wash ourselves in your word daily may we cleanse ourselves by way of confession and go word may we climb this mountain Lord in faith knowing that at the end of the journey you're gonna meet us there help us deal God that will lay our lives completely down that we'll die to ourselves completely that you may be glorified in this day in your name Jesus Christ we pray to be like Jesus to be like G on earth I love to be like all through life journey hallelujah Frogger to glory I to be like can we raise our hands to him to be like Jesus to be like Jesus oh I love to be like in all through lighter me brother - Laurie I has to be like in hallelujah just remember to stay in God's rest and know that God doesn't move by our way of analyzing but God moves only by faith I think that's what it is sometimes we what was the difference between those who believed in the resurrection and Thomas Thomas says I gotta analyze I gotta process this thing what y'all saying doesn't make doesn't make sense I saw him I saw him he was so beaten he doesn't even look human now are you trying to tell me that he's raised he's walking around he's alright see a lot of us don't understand what Thomas battle was because we weren't there but it wasn't easy and I don't think that he just willfully didn't want to believe he wanted to believe but he could there was some element that would not allow him to and Jesus came along and helped him don't you see when you come to a position in your life and you want to believe in you can't believe that's when we need him that's when Jesus comes around and he helps you he will make you a believer because you are a believer well pray over the offering father God we come before you we pray Lord that you bless the offering bless those that gave in those that had a desire to give the Lord let it go through the furthering of your ministry Lord strengthen your servant tonight continue to open the word to us Lord that we may feed your people these people that you have purchased with your own blood father never let us forget where we come from and never let us forget where we're going I pray father God that you would just keep us lording in your presence let us not be one that run to the city of refuge and desire to leave I have no desire to leave this safe haven Haven help us now keep us Lord in your care in Jesus Christ's name we pray I'm so glad Jesus set me free oh Jesus Jesus set me free oh I'm so done Jesus set me free I'm sold on that Jesus
