TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so let us finish uh by the grace of God the message we had on this morning we'll try to finish that up ain't God good to us amen you know a lot of times I don't thank the brethren for the water but I really appreciate it it's a real blessing I'll be in trouble some preachers don't need water but I do amen oh I love that am amen we're going to read the scripture according to Ephesians 4 please United with him right amen United amen just being united with the one we love amen oh that's all that's what it's all about being united with him and uh it's getting better all the time more and more of him and less of me amen Ephesians 4:22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust ain't that amazing a lot of time people don't know that lust is deceitful it is and be renewed in the spirit of your mind amen not talking about your mind your mind your mind amen the new mind and that you put on the new man without which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness remember brother bradam said according to Ezekiel God gives you a new spirit amen and then he place his Spirit which is the holy spirit in your new spirit right in other words he give you a new mind that he can place his mind in your mind amen right wherefore putting away lying in every e every uh speak excuse me wherefore putting away lying speaking every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another and I've read what I need to read there amen let's go to Philippians please Philippians 3:10 Philippians 3:10 that I might know him and and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering let me read that again and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might obtain until the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already obtain neither were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I love this part I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Hallelujah you love the Lord Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things forgetting those things forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before amen I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you amen so I showed you this morning that no matter what you stand in need of all your shortcomings whatever it may be wherever things need to be fixed replaced however you want to say it God will reveal it to you if you have a sincere heart let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and Lord you've been so good to us you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray father God once again that you will anoint your servant anoint the people of God hallelujah and God I pray that you walk in our midst we know you're here because you said in your word where two or three are gathered in your name Hallelujah you are in the midst thank you for being here just make yourself known Lord in whatsoever way you choose to in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen that word conversation mean lifestyle putting away while putting off the lifestyle the old uh form of the old way of living the old man right amen and you know I asked this question some time ago the scripture says amen that uh old things and all things have passed away behold all things have become new amen now you got to understand that is a state of condition of a True Believer amen that is a death burial and a resurrection amen it is a a a a Old World versus a new one and you must understand that the old world Amen passed away by fire Hallelujah come on Amen if you want to put it this way amen what what do they call it when when they burn you up after you die cremated the old world is cremated by the fire of God and nothing is basically left now brother brandham said it like this he said there can never be a true or a complete nihilation he said all it does is take everything back to its original state amen so we realize by the grace of God that what the fire and see this is where I'm at there are so many people amen that don't seem to understand amen that prophet of God gave us utterance he through God God through him made an entrance according to Peter right an entrance into this holies of holies he showed us how to get there amen and he tried to tell even the Pentecostals of their day you're not there yet in other words if you can't receive all amen all of the word if you can't even receive this portion of the words it proves you either don't have the right holy ghost or you need to get it right he was trying to tell him that God cannot deny his word he wrote it he is the amen hallelujah so wherever the word is speaking we must receive it hello take it and receive it by the grace of God now We Know by by God's grace amen that we we for a long time let's put it this way for a long time we believe there was just justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where the Pentecostal stop they stop at the third phase but this message according to the prophet of our day revealed to us that the baptism of the Holy Ghost only was the fire that would sweep it amen the fire that would cleanse it the fire that would prepare it hello for the uh habitation of God himself and that's where the Pentecostals fail because they had the house cleaned they failed to put Faith there to bring God in and now their state is 7 times worse than the beginning because when you don't allow the Holy Ghost to come in the Unholy ghost will amen Satan will take advantage of the clean house amen now this is why amen we find that there are so many people amen that's now are questioning and wondering and things like that anden you know what it is they fail the Sea Harvest Time every seed must bring forth of it is kind I don't care they can't be nothing that they ain't amen that's it and harvest has come and now the anointing of the age is now bringing into clear view the identification of the seeds that were planted in the garden see however it starts that's how it finishes it start holy it must holy hello amen it starts with the fall and sin it ends with the fall and sin come on it started with the Beast it ends with the Beast huh come on somebody now watch this God even Jesus Christ in his day he tried to show amen the Pharisees I am he right I am the same one a men that was in the bush it was a burning bush but it was a bush of thorns it was it was a bush I'mma prove it to you just a moment it was a bush amen of thistle however you want to put it thorns and thistles that's what the Bible says the Bible says because of your sin thorns and thistles it will bring so Jesus had to be robed in thorns and this oh come on somebody and he put the fire in thorns and thistles amen you said that came yes it is then he proved to Abraham I'm the same God Amen why because the ram was caught in the thistle oh my Hallelujah it didn't stop there he took them all the way up to calary and what did he do he crowned himself Hallelujah the thorn and thisle Crown showing he was the same God the Alpha and the Omega the same God of Jehovah is now robed in Jesus Christ himself they failed to see it though they failed to see it like I said this morning he was the same Rock the water that came out of the rock he told the woman at the well I'm the same water he told all over he that whosoever thirst coming to me I'm the same water amen I might not look like the same Rock but I am the rock hallelujah that's what he said he said I was the one in the wilderness that's what he said so comes along and he does the same thing Hallelujah he he he just throws himself out there to the world so that they could see him but let me tell you something the Bible said that the evil man doesn't they don't like light the children of Darkness don't like light they love Darkness because the light will expose them hello somebody they can run from the light but the light coming anyhow Hallelujah it will identify Who You Are you and I we're blessed you said what brother I'm not where I used I should be you're still blessed like that brother who preached the other week he said yes he said all the apples like one tree he said but all of them ain't at the top of the tree he said the whole tree has apples I'm just using this as a scenario he said they don't all rip them at the same time Hallelujah I don't care if I'm at the bottom of the tree I I'm on the tree and I share riping my time's coming [Music] Hallelujah is that all right so I look at this thing I said if the people could really see one of the things that I was trying to show you is that here something happened there in the Garden of Eden that we missed and that is when a god breathed the breath of life into Adam the Bible said he became a living Soul when God breathed the life into Act Adam Eve was there that's right Hallelujah come on because you remember after God separated Adam or Eve from Adam he never had to breathe into her nostrils why because the fire was already there Hallelujah it was showing amen that the same fire that was breathing to Adam is the same fire that is breathing to the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's why the Bible tells tells us amen you got to go to Pentecost Hallelujah that's your day of Jubilee hallelujah oh come on somebody that's your day of Jubilee huh God coming and he promised see that's why brother say you were sealed with the Holy Ghost before the foundation amen hallelujah and he proved that because when he breathed into Adam he was showing that Eve was already she sinned amen but she couldn't be left out cuz the life eternal had already been given come on somebody like I said the sin just broke the relation the fellowship but it never stopped the relationship amen now the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the breach has been restored W come on somebody the breach has been res how do we know we had a Malachi fall that came and show us that the lamb he binded up the brid that means I can fellowship with him whatever I wanted Amen in the morning in the evening in the new time it doesn't matter amen I can fellowship with him all day and guess what he likes it that's the whole purpose of Calvary bringing you and I back to him once again is that all right hallelujah we're not of this world and that's what we've got to come to a reckon we're not of this world Hallelujah when I was shut in I was praying to the Lord Lord I said God I know I'm not a devil I love you too much I may not be able to get live this word like I need to but one thing I do know I am not a serpent amen hallelujah why because in my heart I can repent amen hallelujah and in my heart I desire to do good oh come on somebody that's beyond the serpent he can't repent and he doesn't have a desire to serve God he don't mind being religious but he don't have desire to really serve him cuz if that be the truth came would have say yes Lord I do what you say because I desire to serve you y'all hear what I'm saying listen and Judas he turned his back on God and he couldn't have gone to Pentecost if he wanted to it wasn't in him y'all hear what I'm saying he it wasn't in it and let let me put it this way if you desire and thirsting after the righteousness you just keep Desiring and you keep thirsting and God promis you shall be filled now you say what it mean when in time God has his appointed time Amen to do his work in you I love that I love that and I'm not going to get discouraged amen because I'm not where I should be let me take oh I'm preaching to something different now but let me put it this way you got to recognize that you brother B said the bride in of Jesus Christ in this day came to be what tested tested and tried Hallelujah that means you going to have trouble but you ought to say hallelujah anyhow amen you can't get out of that it's going to happen Hallelujah but we're like Peter I ain't going nowhere right brother rich I ain't going nowhere Hallelujah if I can't taste see smell or hear you I'm still not going nowhere cuz I know you're the Messiah amen come on I wonder I said Lord how can it be the Messiah has come in this day come on you might not want to say this but when William Brandon was on the scene that was the Messiah amen y'all y'all act like y'all listen I don't know about you but I'm a messiah amen that what he told me I'm a messiah Hallelujah I'm not talking about the Flesh of William Brown I'm talking about the Shina of Glory that was in and the same kind of Glory that was in him is in me Hallelujah ah brother brand said what did God do God took took the that that that big pile of that big old fire he said all he did was a rotate a part of himself all into you took a part of himself and put it into you you don't see that that same fire that was in the bush came down on the day of Pentecost and broke up Hallelujah into 120 peie is the same fire showing that God knows how to produce children Hallelujah he couldn't put somebody else's fire in there he had to put his own fire because the fire itself was a very life of himself is that okay that's why the the devil don't want you to get the real Holy Ghost he don't mind you being religious and he don't mind comeing to church and he don't mind amen you sitting around this message amen say well praise God we got it well that's the Pharisees they did say the same thing and listen you couldn't touch their lives when it came to marrow Hallelujah at least some of them but anyhow amen we realize by the grace of God they God was trying to tell them you don't have it yet you don't have it yet right he comes along here come a Rich Young Ruler he said listen I've I've been studying I I've I've been going to church I've done all these things but what must I do to inherit the Kingdom see he understood there was something in him that made him feel out of all he had done incomplete he wasn't there yet so he understood he said good Master Jesus said unto them don't call me good there's only one good and that's God so basically the Rich Young Ruler was saying God he didn't because the rich run ruler never corrected Jesus Jesus said oh excuse me Lord forgive me he didn't say that so he left it that way so he was really saying I see you as God now what must I do same question we come to church and we ask God what must I do to inherit to go all the way with you he say sell all you have amen see the whole point is selling all that you got and follow me amen the Bible said he walked away Grievous because he could not sell out all that he had and I really believe like brother R said he was a minister God was calling him to the ministry you say what do you mean he told Legion you can't follow me right Legion you go and testify but you can't follow me right come on but here is a man Jesus said come follow me he was literally calling him to the ministry oh my think about it and that same gift called out out of the region of the Lost Lord let me go evangelize my family I don't want them to come to this place and Jesus said it won't matter even if one would raised from the dead they still wouldn't hear him so what was Jesus saying there's going to come a resurrection and your brothers are going to hear it and they still won't believe it so there is no end to what's going to happen because they coming the same way you coming y'all hear what I'm saying so we look at the thing oh brother Brooks how is it that God is showing to you and I that the same light that was in Adam the first Adam the same life that's why people say well oh brother I don't understand what what do you don't understand when God they pierced him watch this now they pierced him in the side on Calvary and out of his side comes what blood and water amen why Blood and water Hallelujah because he was signifying I am the water the same water amen that I gave to you it wasn't just a bride coming out it was actually signifying who he was as well amen that he was the blood and the water the light come by both amen what do you mean brother Brooks the blood was shed before the foundation of the world Amen now we do what live by the water of the word sure it was the bride in tight because she comes by the blood she oh come on she overcomes by the blood Hallelujah but she drinks from the well that never runs dry Hallelujah y'all getting quiet on me now that's all right amen we realize amen that same God Jesus Christ in flesh was the almighty God and he couldn't do nothing but show his substance he showed his substance amen that's why brother B said now listen he said if you even had a little bottle of blood chemistry Jesus it wouldn't do you any good because what did God do he hid himself in the cells of that blood Hallelujah come on somebody and so when that op operation was done by a Roman spear hallelujah amen the surgery on the second Adam people say well he didn't come she didn't come out of his side yes she did Hallelujah the first Eve came out of the side of the first Adam and the second Eve came out of the side of the oh come on somebody but he said this bride she will not fail him you know why it's time tested he time he tested it amen throughout time yes he did amen you know why he's it won't fail not because of you he's got a reputation and he will not let you spoil his reputation Hallelujah come on somebody yo his reputation amen he will not allow you to spell his reputation so he will the Bible said cause you to trium now I'm feeling pretty good here now amen he will cause you and I to Triumph you said I I don't know about that Samson represented the bride didn't he not amen with the Seven Locks he was a failure brother benam said they laughed at the Jehovah God hello come on they laughed at the Jehovah God why because Samson represented the Jehovah God so they laughed at Samson amen but God was not going to allow his purpose to fall Hallelujah so what happened God gave Samson a second chance and he knew that Samson would take the chance now this is what I like about it people say well if you commit suicide you're going to hell that's not now altogether true because I want you to understand Samson committed suicide he killed himself knowing he was going to kill himself he said I'm going to die with my y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but what was he he was under the inspiration of God himself now maybe y'all y'all may may not understand but let me put it this way who did Kill God huh God couldn't die as a spirit so God took a son made him up and clay and who did Kill God you think it was the Roman soldiers no sir he said no man can take my life he said I I pick it up I lay it down Hallelujah nobody can do it I've got to do it myself y'all oh Lord y'all I tell you the truth you must understand God is mysterious you can't put him in a box you say oh my somebody say well you know Solomon didn't make it hello what you mean solom didn't make it Solomon is there Hallelujah yes he is I had somebody tell me years ago they said you know what they said ain't nobody going to make it in this Rapture except those who were naturally virgins as well I said oh my god brother will you get there a pastor told me that I said you know what I said you might as well stop stop stop because the woman at the well ain't going to make it Hallelujah come on somebody amen when it comes down to h h h Mary Magdalene she ain't going to make it hey glory to God Amen but God showed we were stuck in the thistles hallelujah amen so he was stuck in this thisle for us that we might be free brother I ain't I don't know whe I've heard this before that's okay if it ain't the word don't take it but let me tell you something it is the word look throughout the scripture and let me tell you something you know uh uh uh uh even brother brandham said this one one thing I better not go there I just say it like this people of God we don't know the mind of God and I wouldn't go tell somebody y'all go ahead on and commit suicide no no no no that's not what I'm saying but I'm saying amen that God worked through Samson in that way now if you just going through troubles and you want to get rid of your that ain't what I'm no no no no no no no no there was a victory in there for Jehovah God now let me move on by the grace of God because I want you to understand there is nothing how many y'all believe the word the Bible said there is no weapon formed against you that will prosper people of God we are the kings of our kingdom hello you can let the enemy come in and destroy your kingdom or you can fight for it Hallelujah the Bible said even the Holy Ghost said the kingdom of God suffereth V vience and the violence take it by force Hallelujah you have to fight for what's right come on somebody he said Joseph he said uh uh uh uh Joshua he said this is yours wherever you put your feet wherever you plant your feet it's yours but you're going to have to fight for it see it's time tested oh Lord hallelujah and you and I must understand I don't care Satan is going to put obstacles in your way hey but that's why it's good to have the token it's good to have that pill of fire on the inside of you because that pill of fire cannot lose a battle it will win every battle when brother Brandon was standing in the pool pit what was he doing trying he wasn't trying to muster up his own mus muscles to do something he said I'm waiting on him why cuz he realized I can't fight this battle my battle is not carnal here it's spiritual Hallelujah with the pulling down of strongholds Hallelujah putting Satan under my feet he said hey I can't I'm waiting on him now when he came back he was a real Warrior when God stepped on the scene he said he's here you can hear the change in His Voice Hallelujah why because he realized the battle has already been fought and the Victory is already won Hallelujah every demon in this house got to go but he told the people he said now listen he said this atmosphere must be an atmosphere of fth Fai he said because unbelief drives him away you got to believe that God is God I'm not even on my notes yet he said you got to believe that God is God huh God is God greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world let me say it like this that woman at the well hadn't even gone to Pentecost yet and she had Joy Hallelujah when she heard he was the Messiah the Bible say she dropped apart ran into the City come see a man she didn't have the Holy Ghost yet some people said well you because I'm saying you ain't got to have the Holy Ghost to have joy when that Revelation strike you Hallelujah come on somebody it brings a stimulation Hallelujah you can't even help it h I hope you're being blessed the Bible called according to Colossians 3 says 1-4 if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are from above above right where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above and not on things of the Earth for ye are dead and your life is what hid with Christ in God like I said just like Eve was in Adam at the first that's the way God wants our lives so he in him nobody can see us they see Christ is that the word that's what Jesus said he said when you see me you see the father Hallelujah when you see me you see the father he was so he in God oh my God was in Christ and Christ was in God is that the word father I would that they be one even as we are one I'm in you you and me you know you know how the scripture go according to St John 17 they became one and all Jesus Christ was interested in is that you see the father work because brother BR said God Jesus never healed anyone that's what he said Jesus never healed he it was God oh Lord the man never healed it was the god in the man whatever I see the father do that's what I he the that's what I do hether to to right that's what he did and that's how if he operated that way that's how we operate Hallelujah we can't just say I want to do this no we wait for him oh come on somebody lie not one to another seeing that we have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created him renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created him brother R said renewed he said listen he said we came into this world with amnesia we forgot where we came from we forgot who we are sin brought these things upon us but the word comes to renew us renew our minds bring us back to remebrance oh Lord I love this right I love this brother talked about it he said listen he said look at at this this man who was in the Army he said he was coming home from the war he had been hit uh by something he had Amnesia amen and he's on the train going home he said all of a sudden the train stops and the man looks out of the window and the and the man who's in charge of him and The Railroad Man watch this guy he gets up he gets off the train the one say should I stop he says no let him go all of a sudden amen he goes out of the train he begins to walk this path he's began to see things amen that looks familiar that's what the message St it brings things to you that looks familiar you know I know this how come I know this I know this how come I know the serpent SE that's right hallelujah oh come on somebody amen it just bring things to you that you remember this is right and he said as he climbed up the hill he saw the small house amen with a little door he said all of a sudden the father saw him coming and you know what he runs out the house to grab his son and you know what he says I knew you would return Hallelujah that's how God is he's watching your Amnesia dissipate amen move away from you and one of these old days he'll grab and hug us and said I knew you would return that wasn't just a story brother B was giv us a parable that we could see ourselves that's the way I look at the word of God inspired of God to sa because he knew that the bride would pick it up h Hallelujah ain't God good oh my goodness I love the Lord listen how is it listen in the message look he says where a man confess when a man confess his sins and get right with God and God drops the sin of this its confession into the blood of his own blood blood and forgives that sin and and replaces in the man listen what he said and then God replaces in the man the original spirit that should have been there huh he gives you the holy ghost that should have been there all along come on somebody his own Spirit making him a Son of God how much more ought the creative power of God to be in the church see it breaks down every wall of of sin it breaks down now listen he goes on to say in the word god hidden himself in Simplicity that there's no more nothing talking about Sin when the Holy Ghost come he he disperses everything no more sin he says that the complete word of God rests within them that the very command of their own Voice Hallelujah the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is a Creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken become God In Action maybe I'm the only one but that was some good wine that was some good wine oh my is that all right Ephesians 6:12 says we ring not against flesh and blood but against flesh I'm Excuse me we wrest not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you know why why I look at this thing and you know this ain't a practice rehearsal this is real war and God threw you out there because he knew exactly what you capable of doing with his holy ghost is that all right listen and only only listen if you if you if let me put this way he will not allow you to be a failure in this world because he's got to use you in the next War he's going to use you in the next War so you got to be a winner hallelujah amen his his reputation is online and he won't let you fail he can't he won't let you you fail is that all right stand when it says stand you got to hold on right uh hold out against the resistance holding out against the resistance is that all right I'm almost done now we look at this thing we say well brother where are you taking us all I'm trying to say I was going to I was going to I have to wait on this other little message I was going to tie into but I I put this way God has been good to us he's given us the Holy Ghost now there's a many people who got the Holy Ghost and is not using it is that right I think was brother Randy reminded me it's just like having a gun and for hunting and you won't even hunt you just got the gun up on the Shelf what the gun is for you don't buy a gun to look at oh that's such a pretty gun oh my goodness what vanity if that's what people do you know what I mean a gun is bought because you need you need to you're going to use that gun to do what kill some Beast y'all hear what I'm saying so my point is this you got the Holy Ghost using if you say and you know you really got it God help me show me how amen the gun done been up there so long I don't know how it works I I may maybe I hadn't shot uh used a gun in a long time my aim is not straight you know what I mean amen so you need to say God help me I've got an enemy out here that seem to be rampant and he's tearing up my family y'all be y'all better become Abraham be like Abraham I love Abraham I I I love Abraham I I was going to use my staff this morning I I didn't get a chance I'm G use it now oh Abraham come up there and says hey I might not be too too much of a man to look like but ain't no way go nobody going to take my my grandson from my I'm going out the lot say y'all get y'all RS in y'all hoes oh I love it I love it I love it one thing your son taught me today and I really believe that cuz when I brought the staff out he says no he said that that's not like Moses staff he said Moses staff was taller than him because God is taller than than Moses said I didn't know that I said you're probably right I said I never thought about it Moses had probably a staff like that to make sure you know that the word is taller than you Moses amen oh I like that I'm going to use it too I'm using it now oh my yes yes little Jonathan he fascinates me I love him but you know I look at it and I says Lord I said here we are you got to realize that's true I like that it's got to be right cuz the word is bigger than us amen the word is bigger than us and if we can see that we can realize and this is one of the greatest Revelations you and I could ever receive the word is God that now I know oh I know that the scripture says St John 1:1 but a lot of people have it here they'll have it here because when the word is God you speak it it become the only potent in other words Satan has no power when you realize the word spoken is God am I making sense that and it will not come back void he gave that to us whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it is yours that's his words so when you ask for something and you believe it's yours why can't we receive it because we fail to see we spoke God only unbelief can can make the word of God of none effect hello but when faith is applied he said you can say to a mountain be thy move and it shall be done he didn't say it was in a in a day did he y'all remember the trial message brother Brandon preacher he said God never put a time element to it you shall over come he didn't say we come on and this is what I I say to the people I said all you got to do is speak it and believe it and I don't care oh my when I was in prayer the Lord said said to me he said just like I told show show showed Abraham he was going to have a son and no matter he long he he waited a long time he said I gave you your children I gave you your children children and you wait on it hey let me tell you talking about a c a crying spell I had me a good one Hallelujah I had me a Revival of Thanksgiving Hallelujah you know something when God comes and he reiterates something to you oh it made the difference of the in the world I I can't even tell you how I'm feeling but let me say it like this people of God the word is God that was one thing brother brandham recognized the word is God and when he preached he understood that was the word he said but when there was a thust say the Lord it ain't you ain't got nothing to do with it it's going to happen just like he said cuz that was truly God speaking himself y'all hear what I'm saying amen and I want to tell you something whether you believe this or not this whole Bible is thus sayth the Lord I believe God people say well I I believe in too let me tell you like this it closing so we can go ahead on with the communion you got to have faith something got to get you up out of that grave and it's got to be more in your ear it's got to be more than just in your head it's got to be in your bones it's got to be such a part of you amen that when you die up it ain't nothing but a spoonful of dust left that dust died in faith knowing it's going to get up one of these old day oh Lord have mercy the Bible said they died in faith and let me let and I'm say it like this when it comes down to this resurrection and that's how that's how kept Satan has tried to kill me by by sicknesses by by cause accidents and everything else and I always tell them no I ain't going nowhere I said and God show me I'm not going nowhere because I believe with all my heart I'm GNA be changed I I believe I this message caught me so I can be one of those amen who are quick and translated change I believe that I had a brother said well a lot of the ones that I know believe they dead now I said said hey that's them and to be honest with you they're not dead maybe they weren't translated in their times but I guarantee you they sitting in Heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus now God still can do what he want to Amen brother brand said I hope I'd see the Rapture I hope to live the right but that's not going to hinder him being there he's going on he says when somebody said William brandham is dead you tell him no he's not did y'all you ever heard him say that he said I'm not dead he said I can't die amen y'all don't believe that I believe it you said what do you mean well if his wife who' been down in the ground all those days or whatever can come at and and touch him on his shoulder and say Bill don't worry about me you got to stop this H see there's a land beyond the river heyen you and I got to recognize amen and and it's true when you see it with the Holy Ghost I'm going tell you what it does it takes away the fear it makes you know that no matter what Satan puts on you he got to go you have the power to resist his diagnosis or whatever it is you have the power because you're not afraid to die hello a lot of times we we take all this medication and everything else only because we're afraid to die hello but when you got a seal Hallelujah and uh something there that says amen I I've heard from my theophany I know I'm going to live again amen death like you said it takes the power out of death Paul said oh death where is your stting oh grave where is your Victory come on none of us don't being sick don't worry us it's the dying is that you it's the dying that worry us am I right or wrong it's true we don't know what it's GNA feel like and Satan fights us all through our Childhood Days anybody know what I'm talking about s Satan fights me oh my hallelujah how many dreams I had before I before I got saved I used to dream they they put me in the coffin I can hear them I can't resp spond they putting the dirt on me I can't get out you know that's a horrible nightmare but since I got saved I've not have had a dream like that since amen come on a dream am man you falling off a cliff and you know you're going to hit something somewhere sometime and everything is dark what was God showing me you lost boy you just good as dead you can't stay here right and then God quickened me now I'm in the light I'm in the light let me say in closing I keep saying that I don't mean to lie I'm trying to tell the truth here in closing let me say it like this if you don't have the faith to be healed or delivered that's what you do you ask God for that's what James says he'll give you Faith he won't even upgrade it he give it to you he won't hinder he won't hide nothing he said if you don't have it ask God you keep asking God I need it I want to be lived I I don't have it yet help help my unbelief come on somebody don't be ashamed because God know whether you have faith or not and it's not wrong with you you know where the the the where the supply is and you you're too too proud to ask him for it let me tell you something I'm not so you keep asking God give me the faith to deliver me to overcome this if I've got the faith to overcome show me how to put it in force right now I'm talking about any and everything Deliverance whatever you might need is already there but a lot of time we don't go to the instruction instructor right for the instruction at least the disciples said Lord help the the man who was being healed said Lord help my unbelief and that's what we do sometime it's not even unbelief sometime you're just being tested are you going to serve God anyhow what you going to do with it you know I don't think Lazarus when he raised up from the dead he had an argument with Jesus why'd you let me die huh you let me lay up in that tomb four days rotted I don't think he had an argument he was so glad to be alive he didn't know what to do right and let me tell you something when God quickens you and bring from from Death to life you going to have somebody upset with you because remember when Lazarus was raised from the dead there were people who was upset cuz he was sitting around the table eating with Jesus now that's how it is and I realize today we've got the greatest Octillery we got so much we got more than enough we can blast the devil out of our Lives amen but we got to learn how to operating h brother brandom said it takes strong faith to operate this message a strong hand of Faith to operate the king sword strong but you got a devil and Devils out here that's ready for the battle y'all hear what I'm saying you love God Amen well I trust you was Blas this evening we uh we know that uh we're living in the last last days and I I I'm I'm just stirred I'm really stirred because I want to make sure that the people of God got all they need I want you to have all you say you have I don't want anybody in this assembly to come up short amen if we could all be quick and translated at the same time it would be wonderful y'all hear what I'm saying but I recognize one thing that day is closer now than it's ever been come on if we see a couple more years we will be doing good because the way the world is moving and the way America is moving come on somebody you got to realize like like like uh the old brother uh Bosworth and and everybody said if if God allow America to keep going the way it it's going without judgment he have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to him and I'm going to tell you something just like I told you a few weeks ago I said we are Beyond Sodom and Gomorrah did you hear what I'm saying brother brandham could not have come on the scene until the scene of Sodom and gomorra was upon the Earth that was when he was here now look he's been gone all those years where are we now where are we now let me tell you something people of God there is not a demon god can't overcome I don't care if it's been with you since you were three years old it don't make no difference if he came into you when you was one God is able to cast that demon out y'all hear what I'm saying devils are devils the kingdom of God Amen comes to bring light you don't believe me I'm going tell you something that ain't nothing but serpent biting your dust huh that's exactly right Satan ain't nothing but a serpent and the serpent loves the dust and your flesh is the dust and he's just biting and biting and devouring and devouring and he don't tell you he said he doesn't tell you I'm killing you he doesn't tell you that story but he's a poisonous venomous Nate is that right that's what he is now I don't care people are saying all kind of crazy stuff and accepting the the thoughts of the world no you cannot the word of God is true everything in here is true you got to take a stand against the devil right well I wanted to ask that earlier but I I'll save it sometime one of these old days we going to have a testimony service a oldfashioned testimony service y'all hear what I'm saying a oldfashioned testimon we going to have a whole fashion testimony service so nobody won't get offended y'all hear what I'm saying but we going to have one by the grace of God because I want the devil to hear what God has done he knows but we want to remind him amen of the victories let us stand I know I've been healed by him anybody I I know I've been delivered by him anybody come on somebody amen I love that like I heard you heard me say Satan's mad I'm so glad he missed the soul he thought he had yes sir and I love the word of God because ain't none of us can none of us can boast and say we lived any cleaner than one or the other right amen the Bible said we had all come short we sin and come short of the glory of God Amen ah thank God for Calvary
