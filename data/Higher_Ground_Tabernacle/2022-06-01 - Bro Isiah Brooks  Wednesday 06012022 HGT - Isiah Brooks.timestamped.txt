[39:58] neither pray i for be alone
[40:01] but for them also which shall believe on
[40:05] me through their word
[40:07] that they all may be one as thou father
[40:10] art in me
[40:12] i in thee
[40:13] that they also may be one in us
[40:17] that the world may believe that thou
[40:19] hath sent me
[40:21] and the glory which thou gaveth me i
[40:24] given them
[40:26] that they may be one even as we are one
[40:31] i in them
[40:33] thou in me
[40:34] that they may be made perfect

[40:38] and that the world may know that thou
[40:41] has sent me
[40:43] and has loved them as thou
[40:45] has loved me
[40:47] oh i get excited every time i read that
[40:49] particular scripture
[40:52] it is a sure salvation
[40:55] revelations one and eight
[40:58] [Music]
[41:00] i am alpha
[41:02] and omega
[41:04] the beginning and the end
[41:09] which is
[41:10] which was
[41:12] and which is to come
[41:14] the almighty
[41:18] one more scripture please
[41:21] that'll come we'll come from matthew 6
[41:24] and 6
[41:28] but thou when thou prayest
[41:32] enter into thy closet
[41:34] when thou has shut thy door
[41:37] pray to thy father which is in secret
[41:41] and thy father which seeth in secret
[41:45] shall reward thee
[41:47] openly
[41:49] let us pray
[41:51] our gracious father god we thank you for
[41:55] your amazing grace
[41:58] we thank you for being
[42:01] so good to us
[42:03] thank you for being the god of heaven
[42:05] the god of earth
[42:08] the god of the universe
[42:10] and thank you for dwelling
[42:12] within us
[42:14] it is an honor and a privilege lord
[42:16] jesus to know
[42:18] that you have made us your tabernacle
[42:21] and we ask in your lovely name
[42:24] that you have free course here this
[42:26] night tonight
[42:28] let your perfect will be done we ask
[42:30] these days in jesus christ's name we
[42:32] pray
[42:33] amen
[42:35] you may be seated
[42:40] when we think about the message that
[42:43] malachi 4 brought us
[42:46] we must always remember
[42:49] that this message is called the end time
[42:52] message
[42:54] reason being is because we really
[42:56] believe that malachi 4
[42:59] the one
[47:06] though be little
[47:08] amen there will be those who will have
[47:10] faith in it
[47:11] because remember the rapture will not be
[47:14] this great number of people
[47:16] in this age that will be translated
[47:19] it will be a few even as not
[47:23] being one
[47:25] in a million
[47:27] so we know that by god's grace that
[47:30] it's not by human effort
[47:32] yeah you can't be saved by because i
[47:35] chose god no no you didn't choose god
[47:39] god chose you
[47:41] and because he chooses us
[47:43] he doesn't make a mistake
[47:45] you understand me and everyone he has
[47:48] chosen
[47:49] has been chosen for a purpose
[47:53] amen now the purpose in which god has
[47:55] chosen us far may not be some grand
[47:59] thing
[48:00] you know because we realize that then
[48:01] hollywood brings to us that you have to
[48:03] be this great superstar superhero in
[48:06] order to be to gain recognition
[48:09] but in god's eyes
[48:11] what he calls great
[48:13] men call foolish
[48:15] and what what god what we we you know i
[48:18] mean god calls it foolish rather and we
[48:21] understand that when god calls something
[48:23] great it's really humble
[48:26] great he said what do you mean just like
[48:28] john the baptist
[48:30] he came out of the wilderness looking
[48:31] like a wild man
[48:33] and i love to say it like this
[48:35] you know eating
[48:37] a wild uh
[48:38] honey eating wild locust and popping
[48:40] them in his mouth like peanuts
[48:42] you know but he looked like a crazy man
[48:46] he wasn't properly dressed his hair
[48:48] wasn't calm his teeth wasn't brushed you
[48:50] know he was just one of those things
[48:52] that we would see today as a homeless
[48:55] person
[48:56] but remember jesus was a homeless person
[48:59] too
[49:00] he said uh foxes have hoes and birds
[49:03] have nests but the son of man has no
[49:05] place to lay his head
[49:07] so we realized that even the early
[49:09] church they weren't a grand dude there
[49:11] wasn't something greater
[49:13] puffed up they they weren't pompous but
[49:16] they were small
[49:18] they were lowly
[49:20] so much so they didn't have much
[49:22] because when peter approached the gator
[49:24] beautiful and he saw the man who was
[49:26] crippled he said silver and gold have a
[49:29] none but such as i have give id
[49:32] so it shows us that something is wrong
[49:35] with the mix
[49:37] something is wrong with what's happening
[49:39] now
[49:40] because now christians who used to be
[49:42] poor are rich
[49:44] and they increase with good and they
[49:46] have this idea in their head they have
[49:49] need of nothing
[49:51] but let me tell you something no matter
[49:52] how rich you become
[49:55] not one thing
[49:56] that you obtain in this world will go
[49:59] with you when you die
[50:01] the only thing that will go with you is
[50:03] the character of jesus christ
[50:06] i pray that we have that
[50:08] coming from the message god provided
[50:10] place of worship
[50:11] the prophet of god said but the hours
[50:13] come that every kingdom
[50:15] has to give way
[50:18] now you and i know amen that america is
[50:21] in trouble
[50:23] and she's poking the bear
[50:25] and and russia has said
[50:27] in their own i heard it on the news
[50:30] that america has declared war with her
[50:34] and you and i know what brother branham
[50:36] says he said
[50:37] russia will be the one that will drop
[50:39] the bomb
[50:40] but before one bomb drop
[50:43] we'll be gone
[50:45] now we don't know how
[50:48] how far this is going to go and how long
[50:51] is going to last
[50:53] but one thing i know is that god is
[50:55] dealing with his bride
[50:57] he's working with her
[50:58] right and he's he's he's literally
[51:01] cleaning her up and he's literally it
[51:03] meant changing her heart and her mind
[51:06] about this world because you have to
[51:08] hate this world there's nothing in this
[51:11] world for us
[51:13] and even though we prosper our
[51:15] prosperity must be uh given to the fact
[51:19] that your soul is prospering so what
[51:22] good would it do for you to prosper in
[51:24] this world and your soul is not
[51:27] prospering
[51:30] the word of god say what what what what
[51:33] what what what is to gain if you gain
[51:36] the whole world and lose your soul
[51:40] your living has been in vain
[51:43] but here the prophet said but the hours
[51:46] come that every kingdom has to give way
[51:49] because there is a kingdom of god
[51:52] that's established i love that word
[51:56] in the human heart
[52:00] huh not in heaven
[52:02] the human heart
[52:04] because heaven and earth will pass away
[52:07] but the word of the lord shall stand
[52:10] and ezekiel tells us that god is god
[52:12] will not only just just give us a new
[52:15] heart or give us a new spirit but he
[52:18] said that god would give us himself
[52:21] hallelujah in that heart
[52:24] and so you must understand that the
[52:26] kingdom of god is with where in you
[52:30] you must acknowledge that
[52:32] because it will uh how can i say it
[52:37] when that revelation strikes you
[52:40] you won't feel
[52:41] any more that like god is a million
[52:44] miles away
[52:47] because he said in that day you'll know
[52:49] that i'm in the father of the fathers in
[52:50] me and i'm in you
[52:52] i'm so happy and that's the way i pray
[52:54] now god i thank you
[52:56] for abiding in me
[52:59] i thank you for choosing me as your
[53:01] tabernacle
[53:03] hallelujah
[53:05] i have a place to worship
[53:07] even if this is destroyed
[53:10] hallelujah
[53:12] listen let me move on
[53:14] is established in the human heart
[53:17] by what the baptism of the holy spirit
[53:20] and the presence of jesus christ
[53:24] now he says the baptism of the holy
[53:27] spirit and
[53:29] the presence of jesus christ
[53:32] that's why brother brahma said
[53:33] justification make room for
[53:35] sanctification sanctification makes room
[53:37] for the baptism of the holy ghost and
[53:39] the baptism of holy ghost makes room for
[53:41] god or christ himself
[53:43] see we must understand living in the uh
[53:46] i got here let me finish this quote
[53:48] first i'm sorry
[53:50] i'm just excited by the baptism of the
[53:52] holy ghost and the presence of jesus
[53:54] christ and christ will come to his bride
[53:58] and will set up a kingdom here on earth
[54:01] that will never be dis diminished
[54:05] how do you get into this kingdom you are
[54:08] born into it
[54:10] how do you know it you just keep how
[54:13] would you belong into a kingdom and
[54:16] disagree with the king
[54:18] see you would be what and the king is
[54:20] the word
[54:22] in the beginning was the word and the
[54:23] word was with god and the word was god
[54:26] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[54:29] among us the same
[54:31] yesterday today and forever
[54:33] god provided place of worship 1965.
[54:37] so what are we doing here
[54:39] we have wasted so much so much time
[54:42] playing religion
[54:45] playing church now i don't believe that
[54:47] we intentionally did it
[54:50] but it was handed down to us
[54:52] in such a way that we fell for it
[54:55] hallelujah you said well what do you
[54:57] mean brother brooks just like the
[54:59] pentecostal church has has handed down
[55:02] all of their dogmas and their creeds and
[55:04] their doctrines to their offspring and
[55:06] their offspring are still standing on
[55:08] that
[55:10] not realizing that god has departed
[55:14] but to them they're right
[55:17] they will fight you for it
[55:20] and they have no idea that they have
[55:23] been married to a system
[55:25] am i right or wrong
[55:27] because jesus is not there
[55:30] revelations 3 he's on the outside
[55:34] of the laodicean church age
[55:37] and brother adam said you have to come
[55:38] out of that to hear his voice
[55:44] you said but they can shout in this i
[55:46] know the bible says he in all above all
[55:50] through all he's all in all
[55:52] jesus christ the living god amen he's
[55:55] he's the one that operates everything
[55:59] hello
[56:01] the same god that gives life to a skunk
[56:04] is the same god that gives life to a
[56:06] rabbit
[56:09] but you know i know
[56:10] that the nature of a skunk and the
[56:12] nature of a rabbit is totally different
[56:14] and they both look cute you know they're
[56:16] cute
[56:17] but to be honest with you i'm not gonna
[56:19] pick up a skunk
[56:21] i will pick up a rabbit
[56:23] especially one of those white fluffy
[56:25] ones
[56:26] but you know the point is
[56:29] we must understand the message must take
[56:32] us farther
[56:33] we've been at a standstill we have been
[56:36] in a place where religion has become our
[56:39] culture
[56:41] it is the truth
[56:43] and it's not religion religion don't
[56:45] save you it might cover you but it
[56:47] doesn't save you
[56:48] the bride of jesus christ knows she must
[56:51] be covered by the blood of jesus christ
[56:55] and you know and i know there are three
[56:57] stages
[56:58] that leads into the fourth
[57:00] justification sanctification baptism in
[57:02] the holy ghost and that leads you into
[57:04] the holies of holies which is christ
[57:06] and in this place man is restored back
[57:10] to his position before
[57:12] the fall now we call it behind the veil
[57:16] brother branham called it behind the
[57:18] veil brother adam also called it amen
[57:20] the shekinah glory
[57:23] and this stage
[57:25] has been the first age outside of the
[57:27] first age
[57:29] where the pill of fire showed himself
[57:34] hallelujah
[57:36] right
[57:38] when paul was going to persecute the
[57:40] christians
[57:41] the pulifiers showed up
[57:44] and paul fell from his horse and said
[57:46] who art thou lord and he said i am jesus
[57:50] see he said that because the people when
[57:54] he prayed in in saint john 17
[57:58] the people and god was one
[58:03] hallelujah
[58:05] they didn't have no overseers
[58:08] no rulers
[58:09] those things came at the woods
[58:12] when men began to exalt themselves
[58:16] you know why didn't not brother branham
[58:18] leave a hierarchy
[58:20] of preachers behind him
[58:22] he did not
[58:25] and that was done for a purpose
[58:28] because he said this message will never
[58:32] organize
[58:33] or become an organization there's
[58:35] nothing wrong with being organized
[58:38] but when you become or an organization
[58:42] where everything must look the same like
[58:44] mcdonald's and burger king and whatever
[58:47] more
[58:48] wearing the same uniforms and acting the
[58:50] same way and you know what i'm saying
[58:53] it's wrong
[58:55] but we have fallen into that kind of a
[58:59] mess and i'ma call it just what it is
[59:03] we have been called to go behind the
[59:05] veil
[59:06] there will be a generation that will do
[59:08] it
[59:09] remember when israel were crossing over
[59:11] the uh the uh uh jordan or the jordan
[59:15] amen and and one or two tribes i believe
[59:18] once they cross over they cross back
[59:20] over
[59:22] what what was it
[59:24] did we do that
[59:26] when we crossed over
[59:28] we saw the pillar of fire then all of a
[59:30] sudden amen we moses is dead
[59:34] and what did we do we crossed back over
[59:37] and thought that the pentecostal way of
[59:39] doing things was going to be the one the
[59:41] way that was going to make us uh ready
[59:43] for the rapture
[59:46] if it didn't work for them
[59:48] it's not going to work for us
[59:50] why did the message why did we have to
[59:53] have the seals open
[59:55] why did the thunders have to roll
[59:57] why did the message have to come why it
[1:00:00] had to come because god needed to
[1:00:02] perfect the people
[1:00:06] pentecostal message cannot perfect you
[1:00:10] it can only take you into the spiritual
[1:00:12] realm
[1:00:14] it can never take you into the holies of
[1:00:16] holies
[1:00:17] they don't have a word to take you there
[1:00:22] they cannot
[1:00:24] but you and i must understand amen if
[1:00:26] and i believe this message with all of
[1:00:28] my heart
[1:00:29] brother bran said when those seals will
[1:00:31] open amen it took us back to the place
[1:00:34] where
[1:00:35] adam and eve was before the fall
[1:00:39] and you've heard me say that so many
[1:00:41] times
[1:00:42] the church building was not constructed
[1:00:45] by martyr and clay by adam and eve they
[1:00:48] were the house of god
[1:00:52] and you and i must understand if we're
[1:00:54] going to get back there there's got to
[1:00:56] be surrendered surrendering
[1:00:59] cementing and dying to our own will
[1:01:02] because it was the will of of adam and
[1:01:05] eve to break the word
[1:01:08] so we must die to that we can't allow
[1:01:11] this and you say well brother books
[1:01:12] don't you see something has to be wrong
[1:01:16] the bible says these signs shall follow
[1:01:18] them that believe
[1:01:22] hallelujah and even though we're not
[1:01:25] running out the gifts gifts are supposed
[1:01:27] to follow us
[1:01:30] if the word is right
[1:01:32] and the word is right
[1:01:35] god is looking for a mature bride that
[1:01:38] can handle the gifts that can handle the
[1:01:40] word why you say well what do you mean
[1:01:43] they're not trying to seek a kingdom or
[1:01:46] build a kingdom
[1:01:47] hallelujah because the kingdom is
[1:01:49] already built
[1:01:51] and jesus christ is the king of the
[1:01:53] kingdom
[1:01:54] and he's in where your heart
[1:01:57] i'm so glad that that's the way it is
[1:02:04] hallelujah
[1:02:08] where there is listen
[1:02:11] at what point in time when we realized
[1:02:13] the truth of the word
[1:02:14] that the message when it was opened made
[1:02:17] us priests and kings
[1:02:20] and yet we're running around like little
[1:02:22] poppers
[1:02:23] poor little me poor little me
[1:02:26] that's nonsense
[1:02:28] you got to understand there is no
[1:02:31] condemnation
[1:02:33] to those who walk not after the flesh
[1:02:35] but after the spirit
[1:02:37] and this message has declared to us that
[1:02:39] we have been completely justified
[1:02:42] as though we've never seen him in the
[1:02:44] first place
[1:02:46] hallelujah and listen what i'm saying
[1:02:49] when it comes to judgment the bible says
[1:02:52] that judgment begins at the house of god
[1:02:55] you know what we were thinking this
[1:02:57] church no sir judgment began at your
[1:03:00] house
[1:03:01] and if you're the house of god you're
[1:03:03] the one that's judging your sins
[1:03:06] hallelujah come on somebody but if you
[1:03:09] judge your sins correctly the bible said
[1:03:12] that god has
[1:03:14] given us
[1:03:15] a freedom
[1:03:17] from the conscience that will condemn us
[1:03:23] that's why we can't do nothing for god
[1:03:25] we're so busy judging ourselves
[1:03:28] looking at ourselves we are so unworthy
[1:03:30] how can that be
[1:03:32] if god has made you worthy how can you
[1:03:35] say you're not worthy
[1:03:38] he's made you
[1:03:41] worthy by the blood of the lamb you've
[1:03:44] got to come up higher and have the mind
[1:03:46] of christ if you are accepted in the
[1:03:48] beloved that means you cannot be
[1:03:50] rejected
[1:03:54] but the thing is
[1:03:56] the problem with us
[1:03:58] is that we have been so
[1:04:00] traditionalized
[1:04:03] we say we're not catholics and yet and
[1:04:05] still we do repentance
[1:04:10] hallelujah god said before you even
[1:04:13] called me i heard you
[1:04:15] i forgave you before you open up your
[1:04:18] mouth
[1:04:19] hallelujah the blood has washed us clean
[1:04:23] we are not a filthy church we are the
[1:04:26] bride of jesus christ because we are in
[1:04:29] him and he is in us
[1:04:33] he said father i pray
[1:04:35] that they be one even as well y'all
[1:04:37] don't know i feel like shouting up here
[1:04:40] he he's here
[1:04:42] and the anointing of god is trying to
[1:04:44] penetrate these things that just
[1:04:46] condemns you all the time
[1:04:48] your flesh will be with you until god
[1:04:51] changes it
[1:04:52] and it will never
[1:04:54] ever walk with god
[1:04:57] not your flesh it is your enemy
[1:05:00] but god knows your enemy
[1:05:03] and god nailed your enemy to the cross
[1:05:06] hallelujah yes he did
[1:05:09] he defeated satan for you
[1:05:14] and when we began to see those things
[1:05:16] we'll begin to understand we are an
[1:05:18] invisible army
[1:05:20] but god cannot operate through us if we
[1:05:23] don't believe it
[1:05:26] that's why satan works so hard on us he
[1:05:29] works with our conscience in the way we
[1:05:31] feel that your feeling has nothing to do
[1:05:34] with
[1:05:34] it amen
[1:05:38] the real you
[1:05:39] you don't even know him yet
[1:05:41] the real you is when you can go behind
[1:05:43] the veil
[1:05:45] when you go behind the veil
[1:05:47] and you shut yourself in like
[1:05:50] like brother branham said amen you'll
[1:05:52] realize amen that it is there you find
[1:05:55] yourself
[1:05:57] it is there you come alive it is there
[1:06:00] you begin to see life for what it really
[1:06:02] is
[1:06:03] hallelujah but until then you still
[1:06:07] looking through a glass darkly
[1:06:10] like paul said
[1:06:12] hallelujah
[1:06:14] you understand me
[1:06:15] you and i must understand that god is
[1:06:18] calling for a bride that's going to be
[1:06:19] bound by the word
[1:06:21] and when i say the word i'm not talking
[1:06:23] about the little the the the rhema
[1:06:28] you know what i mean we're talking about
[1:06:29] the logos
[1:06:31] hallelujah and you can't get the logos
[1:06:33] without the rhema you got to have the
[1:06:35] letter but you have to have the
[1:06:36] revelation of it
[1:06:39] it's important
[1:06:40] brother said when we get over there
[1:06:42] we'll realize how important revelation
[1:06:45] was to us
[1:06:47] hallelujah god is not pleased he's not
[1:06:50] pleased with what he see
[1:06:54] when we call ourselves he's not pleased
[1:06:58] it's not his work that has failed
[1:07:00] but it's us
[1:07:02] we have failed him in the sense that
[1:07:04] we're not
[1:07:06] taking his word
[1:07:08] you won't be the first one he's rebuked
[1:07:11] on the road to emmaus he walked with
[1:07:14] three a disciple two disciples amen that
[1:07:17] should have known
[1:07:18] he said oh fools and slow of heart
[1:07:22] did you not and why didn't you believe
[1:07:24] all that the scripture have said
[1:07:27] concerning me
[1:07:28] or the messiah
[1:07:30] then he went through all the prophets
[1:07:32] he opened the book
[1:07:34] the word was opened
[1:07:36] and he began to preach who jesus
[1:07:39] hallelujah is that what he did in his
[1:07:41] last day
[1:07:43] through the through william brown and
[1:07:44] what did he do the book was open
[1:07:46] and he didn't preach himself he preached
[1:07:49] jesus the same yesterday the day and
[1:07:51] forever a god that changed not he was
[1:07:55] the only man on this earth that was able
[1:07:57] to go all the way back to the old
[1:07:59] testament and bring it up to the new
[1:08:01] testament and gave us a vision of what
[1:08:03] it is
[1:08:05] it was god in him
[1:08:10] god in him
[1:08:13] and what you're going to do with the
[1:08:14] scripture
[1:08:15] that says who going to lay in the charge
[1:08:17] that god's elect
[1:08:18] i'm so tired of these pharisees and
[1:08:20] sadducees in this message
[1:08:23] and all they want to do is point fingers
[1:08:24] at you and you ain't doing this and you
[1:08:26] ain't doing that let me tell you
[1:08:27] something all of us is in flesh
[1:08:30] and you can't tell me you walk in
[1:08:32] perfect
[1:08:33] in this flesh
[1:08:35] your perfection only comes by jesus
[1:08:37] christ he said well i'll never do that
[1:08:39] but you thought it
[1:08:42] and the bible said there's a man
[1:08:44] thinking this is hard so is he
[1:08:46] you're guilty brother branham said we're
[1:08:48] failures to begin with
[1:08:51] but we must understand this failure the
[1:08:54] failure that we used to be god has made
[1:08:57] us victorious
[1:08:59] paul so said paul even said we're more
[1:09:01] than conquerors don't tell me you can't
[1:09:04] conquer whatever the devil brings before
[1:09:06] you you can conquer it
[1:09:08] through christ jesus is that right why
[1:09:11] because great is he that's in you than
[1:09:13] he that is in the world that's the word
[1:09:17] but we're so busy with hollywood
[1:09:19] and i have to be careful because i can
[1:09:21] get excited and dramatic uh cold and
[1:09:23] everything else but you know i don't
[1:09:25] mean to i just it just excites me but
[1:09:27] there are those you think running up and
[1:09:28] down now he
[1:09:31] you know what i'm saying preaching like
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:33] it's okay if that's what you want to do
[1:09:35] but my point is
[1:09:37] who's being changed
[1:09:40] with all that excitement
[1:09:42] with all that music with all that choir
[1:09:44] and all of the things that we've been
[1:09:45] doing just like pentecost
[1:09:47] it's all right
[1:09:49] if the people are being changed
[1:09:52] and this word comes to change you it
[1:09:55] came from out of the holies of holies
[1:09:59] and if you lay in the presence of the
[1:10:00] word it will change you
[1:10:04] that's what i'm talking about you can
[1:10:06] jump as high as you want to like the
[1:10:08] prophet of god said as long as you live
[1:10:09] in it
[1:10:11] but the life comes first then the
[1:10:13] jumping
[1:10:17] i'm alpha and omega i want you to think
[1:10:19] about this when god opened this up to me
[1:10:22] he showed me something i had never seen
[1:10:23] before i'm alfred omega
[1:10:26] that means
[1:10:27] he's the first and the last he's the
[1:10:29] beginning and the ending right he which
[1:10:32] which is which was and which is to come
[1:10:35] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:37] same scripture
[1:10:38] right but what is he trying to tell you
[1:10:42] anything outside of me
[1:10:45] won't be there
[1:10:48] what was with me in the beginning
[1:10:51] will be with me at the end
[1:10:53] and nothing in between
[1:10:55] you understand me you have had to you
[1:10:58] had to be an attribute of god in the
[1:11:01] beginning
[1:11:02] and if you were attributing to god with
[1:11:04] god in the beginning you'll be a
[1:11:06] manifestation of that attribute at the
[1:11:08] end
[1:11:10] nothing can that's why the bible said
[1:11:12] nothing no weapon formed against you
[1:11:15] shall prosper
[1:11:16] listen it doesn't matter who's talking
[1:11:18] about you and spreading lies and
[1:11:20] whatever people do nowadays they they
[1:11:22] still people
[1:11:24] why do you get upset with it
[1:11:27] your adversary is the devil
[1:11:30] brother so and so sister so so grow up
[1:11:33] mama junior hit me you know that kind of
[1:11:36] stuff
[1:11:39] we gotta crawl
[1:11:41] you know it's all right to take licks
[1:11:46] it's okay
[1:11:48] let me tell you something before the
[1:11:50] bride gets up out of here
[1:11:53] you and i will go through what we call a
[1:11:54] squeeze
[1:11:56] we don't know how bad that's going to be
[1:11:59] you mean like food you might like
[1:12:01] clothes you may like house whatever the
[1:12:03] case may be will you still love him
[1:12:08] that's the only way you're going to make
[1:12:10] it
[1:12:10] it cannot be fill your love
[1:12:13] it can't be religious love
[1:12:16] it has to be the love of god which is
[1:12:18] divine in your soul
[1:12:20] peter even said lord you know i love you
[1:12:24] god you know i love you but he said
[1:12:25] peter you're going to deny me three
[1:12:27] times
[1:12:28] peter was greed because he really loved
[1:12:30] jesus in the filial
[1:12:33] but it wasn't enough
[1:12:35] it wasn't enough then it won't be enough
[1:12:38] now
[1:12:40] you got to have a divine love
[1:12:43] and that divine love comes through
[1:12:45] prayer
[1:12:48] you don't have to shout you don't have
[1:12:50] to dance you don't have to run up and
[1:12:52] down the aisles all that's good if
[1:12:54] that's what you do
[1:12:55] but the point is when all that is done
[1:12:59] do you have the peace of god
[1:13:01] in your soul
[1:13:04] listen he said what
[1:13:06] now you're the temple of god
[1:13:08] that's what paul said he had to speak to
[1:13:10] the corinthians because they were such a
[1:13:12] wild group
[1:13:13] the corinthians
[1:13:15] they had everything going on in the
[1:13:17] church
[1:13:19] all kinds of natural disasters
[1:13:24] and and and paul had to say hold up
[1:13:28] no ye not you are the temple of god
[1:13:33] if you devour the temple god is going to
[1:13:36] destroy you
[1:13:38] hello
[1:13:41] now he could not have been talking to
[1:13:42] the bride because that's not the way the
[1:13:44] bride operates
[1:13:47] but he had to send out the warning
[1:13:50] hello somebody
[1:13:53] but here's the key
[1:13:57] one of the things that i think that most
[1:14:00] people missed
[1:14:02] when we talked about the ark of the
[1:14:03] covenant and the way israel had
[1:14:05] everything set up
[1:14:08] they they missed the most important
[1:14:10] thing
[1:14:12] and that was the priest with that
[1:14:13] incense
[1:14:15] and that incense was waved
[1:14:18] and that instance represents prayer
[1:14:21] and you know what you didn't hear it
[1:14:25] it was a
[1:14:26] silence it was a secret
[1:14:29] because even today israel don't know
[1:14:31] what it means
[1:14:34] but the bride of jesus christ
[1:14:36] understands
[1:14:37] the power of prayer
[1:14:40] you understand me he said when you pray
[1:14:43] shout out
[1:14:44] no no no no he said go in your closet
[1:14:48] shut down in your heart
[1:14:51] pray here
[1:14:53] hallelujah because listen it ain't about
[1:14:55] how loud you you pray
[1:14:57] he said listen this is a secret
[1:15:00] this is a love affair
[1:15:02] ah i'm on your throne talk to me
[1:15:05] not here
[1:15:06] here
[1:15:07] because now because you're in need we're
[1:15:09] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:15:11] jesus
[1:15:14] and he said when you pray
[1:15:17] oh i could tell you i've got some good
[1:15:19] testimonies but they're not ready
[1:15:20] they're not ready yet
[1:15:22] but i can tell you something happened
[1:15:24] the other day and my wife says oh
[1:15:27] you handle it because you the one prayed
[1:15:29] for it
[1:15:30] and it's true i did
[1:15:32] but i did not expect it to come so soon
[1:15:36] praise god i'm just being honest with
[1:15:38] you
[1:15:38] and what i'm trying to say is i didn't
[1:15:41] say it i didn't tell the devil what i
[1:15:43] needed
[1:15:45] i'm learning
[1:15:47] how to really commune with him
[1:15:49] and he's communing with me
[1:15:52] hallelujah
[1:15:54] you say do you make mistakes yeah i make
[1:15:56] mistakes and he saw it he's seen it
[1:15:58] before i made the mistakes
[1:16:00] you know i i loved what brother ben he
[1:16:02] set me free then said yeah god
[1:16:04] understand your weaknesses
[1:16:07] and he cares for you
[1:16:09] hallelujah so the devil said we know god
[1:16:12] don't care for me why do i have to go
[1:16:13] through this all the time i i've been
[1:16:15] there i can't tell you how many times
[1:16:18] i've been there but one thing i know if
[1:16:20] you sincerely ask god to overcome he's
[1:16:23] going to do it
[1:16:26] because you're asking according to his
[1:16:28] will
[1:16:30] huh what meat what can it be lust of the
[1:16:32] flesh the lust in the eye and the pride
[1:16:33] of life if you're battling with one or
[1:16:35] two or three of these or all three he
[1:16:37] said whatever that is you can overcome
[1:16:40] it
[1:16:41] blessed is there those who overcome
[1:16:43] these things and people it ain't you
[1:16:46] it's the overcomer in you
[1:16:53] what happens when you pray in secret god
[1:16:56] began to bring it into the public
[1:17:00] god began to let other people see
[1:17:02] they said man that brother is blessed oh
[1:17:04] that sister is blessed but it ain't
[1:17:06] because you know how to pray
[1:17:09] the protocol is very important
[1:17:14] and you got to understand your jesus for
[1:17:16] the day
[1:17:17] you say oh brother brooks now what are
[1:17:18] you saying well the jesus that people
[1:17:21] worship yesterday is not the same it's
[1:17:23] the same jesus but it's unfolded in a
[1:17:26] greater way
[1:17:29] you say well how can you say that
[1:17:31] because remember the woman
[1:17:33] at the well
[1:17:35] and you talking about the law
[1:17:38] huh
[1:17:39] but one thing jesus commit gave the
[1:17:42] jewish people a compliment
[1:17:45] he said to the woman he said the jews
[1:17:48] know who they worship
[1:17:53] but you samaritan you don't know what
[1:17:55] you worship
[1:17:57] understand what i'm trying to say
[1:18:00] even though they so-called worship the
[1:18:02] same are looking for the same god in
[1:18:04] worship but they had a different
[1:18:06] revelation of him
[1:18:09] amen and so is it today
[1:18:12] everybody some people think jesus is
[1:18:14] baby jesus still in a manger
[1:18:17] somebody thinks he's two people three
[1:18:19] people you know that kind of stuff
[1:18:21] somebody some people think he's in uh is
[1:18:23] a lesser god to god
[1:18:26] he cannot be
[1:18:28] if he is he's a liar and he cannot lie
[1:18:30] he said i and the father are one
[1:18:37] and all you got to do is say lord
[1:18:39] explain that to me
[1:18:41] so i'll tell you
[1:18:43] if you can't see it
[1:18:45] god and jesus christ being one
[1:18:47] you'll never be able to see you in god
[1:18:49] being one
[1:18:53] it's a revelation
[1:18:56] see is god alone in his attributes
[1:19:00] this whole scene of redemption was only
[1:19:03] given to us that we might know him in a
[1:19:05] different way so when we get there
[1:19:08] we won't do another lucifer thing
[1:19:17] alpha and omega the first and the last
[1:19:19] with him from the beginning listen
[1:19:21] people of god
[1:19:23] so that you understand i'm working with
[1:19:25] predestination
[1:19:27] when i was a baptist i was saved
[1:19:30] when i became an apostolic i was saved
[1:19:34] when i came into this message i was
[1:19:36] saved
[1:19:38] what dare you say that
[1:19:40] were you baptized in the name of jesus
[1:19:42] christ yet
[1:19:44] i was baptized in the name of the lord
[1:19:46] jesus christ before the foundation of
[1:19:48] the world
[1:19:50] i got the holy ghost before the
[1:19:52] foundation of the world that's on record
[1:19:56] it didn't happen in time
[1:19:58] it happened when there was none
[1:20:03] i feel like shouting here
[1:20:05] and the devil always trying to throw
[1:20:07] something at you only be elected those
[1:20:10] who were with him from the beginning
[1:20:12] will be there at the end and nothing can
[1:20:15] stop it
[1:20:17] this is why i'm saying people believe it
[1:20:20] say lord i want to be about my father's
[1:20:23] business
[1:20:24] whatever it is i want to do it for you
[1:20:28] if it ain't nothing but providing you
[1:20:30] with a donkey
[1:20:33] did you know that
[1:20:34] that man who provided jesus with that
[1:20:36] donkey was ordained
[1:20:38] to provide him with that donkey and you
[1:20:40] never hear nothing else about him
[1:20:44] but with all my heart i know he'll be
[1:20:46] there
[1:20:48] it's a secret place
[1:20:51] that's why god just puts us into a
[1:20:54] little simple place like this and
[1:20:56] you know i i sometimes i thought many
[1:20:58] times i i surely want me a building
[1:21:02] but i only want a building if god wants
[1:21:04] us to have one
[1:21:06] and if this is the place that he set us
[1:21:07] in until he till we change and go in the
[1:21:10] rapture
[1:21:11] so be it
[1:21:13] i'm not here to interpret his word
[1:21:15] i'm just here to preach it
[1:21:17] and however he interpreted he interprets
[1:21:19] it the way he wants to and i'm going to
[1:21:21] say amen to it either way it goes
[1:21:26] he said well what do you mean brother
[1:21:27] works listen
[1:21:29] it's gotten to a place that even people
[1:21:31] now don't know how to pray
[1:21:34] that's why they can't pray long they
[1:21:36] don't know how to pray or what to pray
[1:21:37] for
[1:21:38] when there's gazillions of things that
[1:21:40] we need to pray for
[1:21:43] god wouldn't tell you to pray without
[1:21:44] ceasing if there was nothing to pray for
[1:21:47] but the truth of the matter is we're
[1:21:49] just too selfish
[1:21:50] we just pray for our needs
[1:21:54] and we forget about everybody else's
[1:21:57] but there are so many things to pray for
[1:22:01] i can't go through the list
[1:22:03] but you should never work you should
[1:22:05] never run out of words
[1:22:08] and you got to understand by god's grace
[1:22:10] amen that when we do pray
[1:22:13] we are in union with the holy spirit
[1:22:19] it's not a ritual
[1:22:21] it cannot be a ritual
[1:22:24] or a tradition
[1:22:28] then we become like catholics
[1:22:30] we worship just you know what's the
[1:22:32] difference
[1:22:33] if you're going to use the our father's
[1:22:35] prayer like the rosary beads
[1:22:39] same tre same same stuff
[1:22:42] don't even understand what the our
[1:22:44] father's prayer is
[1:22:46] don't even know what it means
[1:22:48] we think it's just a little nice prayer
[1:22:51] that we sing amen by the grace of god
[1:22:53] god knows who he talking to
[1:22:56] and you and i must understand when it
[1:22:57] comes to these things amen it's not
[1:22:59] because we are so smart that we got it
[1:23:02] it's because god reveals it to us
[1:23:05] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:23:07] the most high shall abide under the
[1:23:10] shadow of the almighty and i know people
[1:23:12] in this message don't like for me to
[1:23:14] talk this way but i don't care what you
[1:23:16] think about it i go and do and i do what
[1:23:18] god tells me to do
[1:23:20] i'm not going to get you all excited
[1:23:22] because right now we need change
[1:23:26] it's going to be heaven or hell there
[1:23:27] ain't going to be no in between if there
[1:23:29] is a purgatory this is it
[1:23:34] y'all look like so sad y'all look so sad
[1:23:43] i'm not gonna say nothing but you gotta
[1:23:45] understand by god's grace
[1:23:49] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:23:51] the most high i don't know how to tell
[1:23:52] you like i have to use the word y'all
[1:23:55] because it includes everybody but those
[1:23:57] of us who not included in that you know
[1:23:59] you're not
[1:24:02] but don't correct the holy spirit he
[1:24:03] knows who he's talking to
[1:24:06] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:24:08] the most high shall abide under the
[1:24:10] shadow of the almighty
[1:24:13] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[1:24:18] and my fortress
[1:24:20] my god
[1:24:22] in him will i trust
[1:24:27] psalms 27 3-8 says though and hosting
[1:24:30] camp shouldn't camp against me my heart
[1:24:33] shall not fear
[1:24:34] though war should rise against me in
[1:24:37] this will i be confident what is the
[1:24:39] message to you
[1:24:44] and my point is this
[1:24:46] where is jesus christ then
[1:24:52] he said if they say low here and lo
[1:24:54] there don't go
[1:24:56] where the carcass is
[1:24:59] there were the eagles be gathered
[1:25:01] what are you saying brother brooks until
[1:25:03] we realize that we the bride of jesus
[1:25:06] christ is the manifestation of jesus
[1:25:08] christ for this hour
[1:25:12] you got to see it
[1:25:14] you got to understand who you are and
[1:25:16] what god has called you for he did not
[1:25:19] call you here to go hollywood on him
[1:25:22] that's what pentecost did
[1:25:26] oh they got the sensations and they can
[1:25:28] make the money and they can pull the
[1:25:30] people and everything else and make them
[1:25:32] speak in tongues and everything else and
[1:25:34] what did you get but a conglomeration of
[1:25:36] mess
[1:25:38] and then over here you know you say well
[1:25:40] you don't get the holy ghost this whole
[1:25:41] you get the holy ghost but holy ghost
[1:25:43] without sensation but that don't mean
[1:25:44] you dead
[1:25:47] we got people here that are dead
[1:25:50] and people by the grace of god i can't
[1:25:53] tell you i can't give you life i cannot
[1:25:57] but the holy ghost can
[1:26:00] though in that house shouldn't camp
[1:26:02] against me my heart shall not fear
[1:26:05] the war shall rise against me and this
[1:26:08] will i be confident
[1:26:10] one thing i have desired or desired of
[1:26:12] the lord that will i seek after
[1:26:15] one thing
[1:26:19] that must be your prayer priority this
[1:26:22] one thing
[1:26:30] if not the devil will get you
[1:26:34] it doesn't matter who we who you are and
[1:26:36] who you claim to be
[1:26:38] your earnest desire
[1:26:41] is to be what god wants you to be in
[1:26:42] this last day
[1:26:44] and you'll never complete that
[1:26:46] until you find yourself behind
[1:26:48] the veil
[1:26:53] how many people in the message
[1:26:56] have died
[1:26:57] believing they were there
[1:27:00] and found out they were not
[1:27:02] because they followed a prophet
[1:27:04] and never met jesus
[1:27:08] because they were married to a system
[1:27:11] oh y'all we're gonna we're gonna have a
[1:27:13] rude awakening
[1:27:16] i don't know who they are but i'm sure
[1:27:18] there have been many
[1:27:20] people who can live any kind of way but
[1:27:22] because i follow william branham he's my
[1:27:24] prophet he's this that the other listen
[1:27:27] brother branham was never your savior
[1:27:31] and if you think like that you're lost
[1:27:33] already
[1:27:35] jesus christ is the only one that's your
[1:27:37] savior
[1:27:40] it took his blood to redeem you
[1:27:44] that's why i love brother branham
[1:27:45] because he always did exalted jesus
[1:27:47] christ he never ever
[1:27:50] uh exalted himself
[1:27:53] during wholesome camp against me
[1:27:55] my heart shall not fear
[1:27:57] the war should rise against me in this
[1:28:00] will i be confident why are you reading
[1:28:02] this because brother branham said this
[1:28:05] is he preached the rapture out of this
[1:28:07] particular scripture
[1:28:09] and if he preached the rapture out of
[1:28:10] his this scripture that means this
[1:28:13] scripture is prophecy
[1:28:17] i will not fear
[1:28:19] oh come on somebody
[1:28:21] you see that police car coming in your
[1:28:23] your and you're not even wrong but your
[1:28:25] heart skip a beat
[1:28:31] i will not fear cast that fear down when
[1:28:33] you know when you know you're right you
[1:28:35] stand for it you don't care about what
[1:28:36] nobody thinks about it
[1:28:39] you stand on writing
[1:28:43] that i might dwell listen
[1:28:46] i just want to say it like this
[1:28:49] we've got a lot of pain and sorrow
[1:28:51] coming up the road
[1:28:53] and i don't think what we the people who
[1:28:55] we call bride is not ready for it
[1:28:58] i don't know where god gonna make us
[1:29:00] ready how it's gonna happen
[1:29:02] but i know as we are now
[1:29:05] people can't take little things
[1:29:10] people still have that spirit of
[1:29:12] fighting in them
[1:29:13] physically
[1:29:16] and the sad thing about that
[1:29:18] that means you're not born again
[1:29:20] you ain't got the goods
[1:29:23] right because though peter had the
[1:29:25] ability to cast out devils though he had
[1:29:28] the ability you know to preach the
[1:29:30] gospel
[1:29:31] hallelujah he still was not converted
[1:29:35] and he followed jesus
[1:29:37] and he wanted to take the head off of
[1:29:39] that soldier
[1:29:40] the soldier duck and he got his ear
[1:29:44] and god had already told him he wasn't
[1:29:45] converted
[1:29:50] for in the time of trouble he should
[1:29:51] hide me in his pavilion
[1:29:54] in the secret place of the tabernacle
[1:29:56] shall he hide me
[1:29:58] he shall set me up upon a rock am i here
[1:30:00] to condemn you i am not that's not what
[1:30:04] i'm doing i'm literally trying to spread
[1:30:06] love to you tonight
[1:30:08] i'm trying to get you to see by god's
[1:30:10] grace it's all right the bible says
[1:30:13] according to revelation repent
[1:30:16] leonard said we're always repenting
[1:30:22] listen but if you read your church age
[1:30:24] book
[1:30:25] if you haven't read you can see the
[1:30:26] nicolaitan spirit is among us
[1:30:30] it is
[1:30:32] call it what you want to but it's really
[1:30:34] that's what it is if it wasn't so we
[1:30:36] would have never been divided
[1:30:39] because nicolaitanism divides people
[1:30:43] your group against mine
[1:30:45] my group against yours because my leader
[1:30:48] preached different from yours and he's
[1:30:50] more deeper than yours and
[1:30:52] listen
[1:30:55] the amount of knowledge you know is not
[1:30:57] what gets you there
[1:30:59] because you could be as ignorant as a
[1:31:01] rock but if you know how to pray
[1:31:04] and get a hold of god
[1:31:06] you'll be there
[1:31:11] now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:31:13] mine enemies round about me therefore
[1:31:15] will i offer in his tabernacle
[1:31:17] sacrifices of joy
[1:31:19] i love to see that i'd love to see some
[1:31:21] joy
[1:31:22] i was seeing yeah i would sing praises
[1:31:24] unto his unto the lord
[1:31:27] hear o lord hear o lord when i cry with
[1:31:30] my voice have mercy upon me and answer
[1:31:33] me
[1:31:33] when thou shalt seek thy my face and
[1:31:36] that's what he's saying
[1:31:38] seek my face
[1:31:40] my heart said unto thee thy face lord
[1:31:44] will i seek
[1:31:46] seek
[1:31:47] me uh seek me
[1:31:49] upon a rock set me upon a rock right so
[1:31:53] listen
[1:31:54] give me a revelation and that's what
[1:31:55] he'll
[1:31:56] do because your born-again experience is
[1:31:59] a revelation
[1:32:02] before it is ever a good feeling
[1:32:06] it's a revelation
[1:32:08] it's when faith breaks to you and you
[1:32:11] are identified
[1:32:12] in christ
[1:32:14] by your faith
[1:32:15] in christ
[1:32:20] am i bride
[1:32:23] can i ask you something if you're not
[1:32:25] bribed then what's going to qualify you
[1:32:27] what can you do
[1:32:29] to make yourself pride
[1:32:32] tell me
[1:32:33] what can you do the bible says you can't
[1:32:35] even have one cubit to your statue so
[1:32:38] how in the world we're going to make a
[1:32:39] statue of a perfect man
[1:32:41] brother branham said it's not you that
[1:32:42] add to it he adds to you
[1:32:45] you get born again you get that sea
[1:32:47] quicken and it will grow in you
[1:32:51] oh help me jesus
[1:32:53] it's so much but when thou prayeth enter
[1:32:56] into that closet and when thou has shut
[1:32:58] thy door
[1:33:00] pray to thy father you can have a
[1:33:02] literal closet if you want to i do
[1:33:04] but the point is amen you always should
[1:33:07] have somewhere you could pray
[1:33:09] and not be interfered with
[1:33:12] because just as sure you you you set a
[1:33:14] time to pray or tell somebody i'm
[1:33:16] getting ready to pray your phone gonna
[1:33:17] ring off the hook
[1:33:20] the secret of life is found in a secret
[1:33:22] place
[1:33:24] is that right
[1:33:26] oh come on even in the natural when two
[1:33:28] come together it is in a secret place
[1:33:39] i'm almost done just just i'm almost
[1:33:41] done
[1:33:42] but i'm here to to
[1:33:43] i know i'm screaming because i i don't
[1:33:46] know what else to do
[1:33:47] i know what god is doing in me i know
[1:33:50] what he's doing in me he's changing me
[1:33:53] and i know that i see that and i'm glad
[1:33:55] about that
[1:33:56] i'm closer to him now than i ever been
[1:33:59] you know what i don't care you know the
[1:34:01] thing is people don't know this
[1:34:04] nobody knows this
[1:34:06] the only person that knows this is god
[1:34:08] himself i don't know what's in your
[1:34:10] heart but god knows what's in my heart
[1:34:13] as well as yours
[1:34:17] and god also thank god he didn't save us
[1:34:19] on merits
[1:34:21] well you know you've been a pretty good
[1:34:22] boy i think i'll save you
[1:34:24] no he never works with that
[1:34:27] usually he get the scum of the earth
[1:34:28] like myself
[1:34:32] huh
[1:34:33] all the years that i've been saved
[1:34:35] i wish it would have taken the same
[1:34:37] moment i got saved
[1:34:38] to clean me up
[1:34:40] but it didn't work that way and it
[1:34:42] doesn't
[1:34:43] work that way
[1:34:45] but just like i tell people
[1:34:47] by god's grace
[1:34:49] i have been as honest with god as i
[1:34:51] possibly can
[1:34:52] i don't say as you've heard me say
[1:34:54] before lord forgive me of my known and
[1:34:57] my unknown sins
[1:35:00] i got enough conscience and enough holy
[1:35:02] ghost to know when i sin
[1:35:07] you're unknown
[1:35:12] oh lord help us jesus
[1:35:14] i don't mean to laugh but it's the truth
[1:35:16] people pray like that i've heard them
[1:35:18] pray
[1:35:19] that's when they don't know god
[1:35:24] why would god say if your conscience
[1:35:26] condemn you then you're condemned why
[1:35:29] say that
[1:35:31] because he set a law within you
[1:35:33] whether you were sinner or saint
[1:35:37] for that they shall come upon thee
[1:35:39] that thine enemy
[1:35:41] shall cast a trent about thee
[1:35:45] and compass thee round
[1:35:47] and keep thee in on every side
[1:35:52] and shall lay thee even with the ground
[1:35:55] thou children within thee
[1:35:58] and they shall not leave in
[1:36:00] leave in thee one stone upon another
[1:36:03] because thou kneweth not the time of thy
[1:36:06] visitation and i'm gonna tell you
[1:36:08] something that's exactly what has
[1:36:09] happened to us
[1:36:14] jesus was right there
[1:36:17] the word was right there
[1:36:19] preaching to them trying to get them to
[1:36:21] see a different order is come and that
[1:36:24] order was grace
[1:36:28] and he came in our day through william
[1:36:30] branham
[1:36:32] and gave us a new order
[1:36:36] and yet we so many people didn't realize
[1:36:38] the visitation it wasn't the man it was
[1:36:41] god in the man
[1:36:44] they if they understood paul paul didn't
[1:36:46] say well you know i'm the angel to the
[1:36:48] church he didn't know it
[1:36:50] and if he did he couldn't tell nobody
[1:36:54] but look what he did it was something
[1:36:56] compelling him to preach the word of god
[1:36:58] in a way that nobody else could do
[1:37:03] it's like jesus christ nobody fully
[1:37:06] understood him until he died
[1:37:10] then after his death he became the
[1:37:12] testator became a testament a new one
[1:37:16] by the blood
[1:37:18] and then that gospel was so hard to
[1:37:20] preach
[1:37:22] because they were so
[1:37:24] bound by the law
[1:37:27] think about it in the smyrna church age
[1:37:30] which means builder of bitterness they
[1:37:32] hated the christians
[1:37:35] because they were preaching grace i'm
[1:37:37] talking about the jews in smyrna
[1:37:40] hated the christians burned them to the
[1:37:42] stakes whatever they could do to kill
[1:37:44] them they even as i was i was told they
[1:37:47] even broke the sabbath
[1:37:51] to build fires
[1:37:52] to burn them up
[1:37:55] you understand what i'm saying
[1:37:57] that hatred is not gone
[1:38:02] the hatred is still here
[1:38:04] the only thing that's keeping it now
[1:38:05] bound is the law but wait to that law is
[1:38:08] lifted
[1:38:09] when the church or the christian church
[1:38:12] will become the enemy to the world and
[1:38:14] you can see that thing moving
[1:38:15] politically already
[1:38:20] what you're going to do
[1:38:22] are you going to be ashamed of your
[1:38:24] faith
[1:38:25] are you going to be shamed what god has
[1:38:26] done for you and listen people the world
[1:38:29] hates william branham
[1:38:35] they don't know
[1:38:36] they don't understand
[1:38:38] but a prophet is without honor in his
[1:38:40] own country
[1:38:42] and every prophet was killed in a bad
[1:38:44] way
[1:38:47] they hated isaiah so much they cut him
[1:38:48] in half
[1:38:54] they didn't understand their visitation
[1:38:55] and because you don't understand your
[1:38:56] visitation that means you left in
[1:38:58] darkness
[1:39:00] and the judgment of the lord will strike
[1:39:04] going on and he says listen and when he
[1:39:06] and when he and he went into the temple
[1:39:09] and began to cast out them that showed
[1:39:12] therein and them that bought saying unto
[1:39:14] them it is written my house is the house
[1:39:18] of prayer but ye have made it a den of
[1:39:20] thieves
[1:39:23] oh that's not in our day yes it is
[1:39:27] you got preachers with tons of money
[1:39:31] tons
[1:39:33] and the people still walking the church
[1:39:36] ain't holly got no clothes
[1:39:39] huh
[1:39:41] it's true
[1:39:43] don't be talking about my preacher well
[1:39:45] it's true
[1:39:49] i'm not saying people are doing these
[1:39:52] things willfully but you see they've
[1:39:53] been caught up into the system too and
[1:39:55] it's going to take god to reveal to them
[1:39:58] don't worry he will
[1:40:00] the bible said he'll never come short
[1:40:02] with of one
[1:40:04] no all that was in his mind to be bride
[1:40:06] will be there no matter what it takes to
[1:40:09] bring them up it's going to happen
[1:40:12] some of us are being led by like a lamb
[1:40:14] and some of us will have to be driven by
[1:40:16] like cattle but we'll be there
[1:40:19] but the lord is in his holy temple
[1:40:22] let all the earth keep silence before
[1:40:25] him you know i'm looking at the
[1:40:27] scripture and i've seen it so many times
[1:40:29] and i thought oh there it is paul said
[1:40:31] it's not i that live
[1:40:33] but christ that lives in me
[1:40:36] paul is saying this or earth
[1:40:38] has come to a dead silence
[1:40:42] my mind my mind and my mind is gone they
[1:40:45] used to say it
[1:40:46] he's just saying that song in the
[1:40:48] pentecost my mind is gone
[1:40:50] yeah you can take it another way too
[1:40:53] but the problem
[1:40:57] the truth of the matter is is true
[1:41:00] you and i say well brother brooks is too
[1:41:02] hard no it's not hard don't say that
[1:41:05] don't even let the devil put it in your
[1:41:06] mind you know it's hard when you think
[1:41:08] human effort
[1:41:10] yes it's hard because you can't
[1:41:11] accomplish that
[1:41:14] but prayer
[1:41:17] god can
[1:41:20] and that's what you must that's where
[1:41:21] you that's where see
[1:41:26] david understood it
[1:41:28] he said i looked toward the hill
[1:41:30] for when's coming from my health
[1:41:32] and my health cometh from the lord
[1:41:35] you think jonah knew where which way to
[1:41:37] turn when he was in the belly of the
[1:41:39] well
[1:41:41] by faith god turned him
[1:41:45] you don't know the way i don't know it
[1:41:47] i'm being led by the lamb of god right
[1:41:50] now
[1:41:52] his leadership
[1:41:54] you say brother brooks you preaching
[1:41:56] different from everybody else i can't
[1:41:58] help it
[1:41:59] when you see what you see
[1:42:01] you must declare what you see
[1:42:04] watchmen on the wall
[1:42:07] what are the night
[1:42:08] he said the night cometh and so does the
[1:42:10] morning right you and i must understand
[1:42:13] this is a dark time and i have been
[1:42:16] ordained to declare what i see
[1:42:19] i don't care about friendships
[1:42:22] as long as i got friendship with jesus
[1:42:25] that's all that matters you say oh
[1:42:26] brother brooks you keep you keep
[1:42:28] preaching like that i ain't coming back
[1:42:30] well you're not leaving me
[1:42:32] you're leaving god
[1:42:34] they didn't understand it when jesus
[1:42:36] said eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:42:39] they left him
[1:42:40] because they disagreed with his dog or
[1:42:43] doctrine
[1:42:44] they didn't understand it listen if they
[1:42:47] only had stood still just for a little
[1:42:49] while god would have revealed it to him
[1:42:52] but instead they walked away because
[1:42:54] they had all of this stuff in their head
[1:42:59] this message is a revelation
[1:43:02] god in you christ in you the hope of
[1:43:04] glory
[1:43:06] and let me say it like this you're not
[1:43:07] getting getting getting to heaven on
[1:43:10] your morality
[1:43:12] morals it will not get you there because
[1:43:14] there's so many people in different
[1:43:16] religions who have better morals than
[1:43:18] all of us
[1:43:19] but morals is not it
[1:43:23] have you been washed
[1:43:25] in the blood of the lamb
[1:43:28] that's it
[1:43:30] within the soul of man are no emotions
[1:43:33] and that's what you must understand
[1:43:35] william branham state that there is only
[1:43:37] one
[1:43:38] that dwells in the heart and that's
[1:43:40] either faith or doubt
[1:43:49] oh let me say this and then i'm gonna
[1:43:52] close because it's almost nine o'clock
[1:43:54] in in the way of a true prophet of god
[1:43:57] he says i do believe that's paragraph
[1:43:59] 138 i do believe in purgatory but i
[1:44:02] believe it's right now
[1:44:04] you purge your own soul
[1:44:08] purgatory means to purge
[1:44:11] and when you see listen
[1:44:13] purging is not easy
[1:44:15] you say what do you mean you women
[1:44:17] sisters y'all know when you got a stain
[1:44:20] this is the way it used to be
[1:44:22] we used to wash with our hands you know
[1:44:26] and we scrub it
[1:44:27] put that soap on there and try to get
[1:44:29] that thing out
[1:44:30] right and when you couldn't get it you
[1:44:33] put more on it and then you get a brush
[1:44:35] but you got to be careful because you
[1:44:36] could brush a hole in it
[1:44:38] done that too
[1:44:41] so my point is listen you got to be
[1:44:43] purged purgatory means to purge and when
[1:44:46] you see you've done something wrong get
[1:44:49] out there and clean it out of you
[1:44:52] by
[1:44:53] confession
[1:44:54] and crying and fasting and praying
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:03] see whatever it takes this got to go
[1:45:06] that's what he's saying
[1:45:08] whatever demons in me it got to go
[1:45:11] whatever darkness that's influencing me
[1:45:13] it has to go
[1:45:14] and listen those demons those spirits is
[1:45:16] not in your soul it's in your it's in
[1:45:19] it's not in your flesh it's in your
[1:45:21] flesh your spirit but never in your soul
[1:45:24] your soul has the holy spirit but he's a
[1:45:26] gentleman
[1:45:28] he's not going to make you do anything
[1:45:31] you got to let go and let god
[1:45:33] and guess what
[1:45:35] those who suffer in the flesh has ceased
[1:45:37] from sin
[1:45:41] y'all know what i'm saying
[1:45:45] it's like saying i'm not gonna eat any
[1:45:47] more ice cream
[1:45:49] and the day you say that somebody bring
[1:45:51] a big bowl by your house
[1:45:56] now you're gonna you're gonna forget
[1:45:58] you're gonna forget quickly
[1:46:01] if you haven't made a constitution with
[1:46:03] yourself that i'm not gonna eat no more
[1:46:05] ice cream
[1:46:06] because you know what the devil said if
[1:46:08] you don't receive this ice cream you're
[1:46:10] gonna hurt their feelings
[1:46:12] and then after you eat that ice cream
[1:46:14] you don't hurt your own feelings
[1:46:21] oh lord help us jesus i'm almost done
[1:46:23] people
[1:46:24] someone even laughed at me when i when
[1:46:26] the lord came here not long ago and gave
[1:46:28] me a vision
[1:46:30] i always wanted to see about binding
[1:46:33] that serpent
[1:46:35] i always wan wondered how to do how to
[1:46:39] i should step out like that and when
[1:46:42] that's what i've wanted all my life then
[1:46:45] i began to fast and pray said what would
[1:46:49] you do for that for
[1:46:51] and i said in there he said i was not
[1:46:55] sincere enough
[1:46:57] after he come
[1:46:59] then i
[1:47:00] wanted to purge myself
[1:47:02] not wait till you die
[1:47:04] let some priest try to purge you purge
[1:47:07] your soul
[1:47:09] but see they took it out of the uh
[1:47:13] authoritative word and put it over in
[1:47:16] the hands of some man-made dogma to
[1:47:18] bring money into the church or because
[1:47:20] they look at worldly things and worldly
[1:47:22] church gets power in the world political
[1:47:25] power but god looks to his word and any
[1:47:29] word that's contrary to god's word is
[1:47:32] wrong
[1:47:33] as far as i'm concerned it's the word
[1:47:36] or nothing yes sir yes sir
[1:47:39] he would he would go straight to the
[1:47:42] foundation he would tear the thing to
[1:47:44] pieces he would have to he would have to
[1:47:49] he couldn't do nothing else if amos was
[1:47:52] here today he couldn't do nothing else
[1:47:55] for remember he is the true prophet of
[1:47:57] god
[1:47:59] who the word come to he couldn't do
[1:48:01] nothing else but go back to the word no
[1:48:04] matter if all the pentecostals in the
[1:48:06] country gathered around him and said sir
[1:48:09] amos we believe you to be a prophet but
[1:48:12] you're off of the word we want to
[1:48:14] straighten you up he wouldn't he would
[1:48:17] stay with the word there is nothing else
[1:48:20] he could do because he's a prophet he
[1:48:22] didn't need their cooperation he got a
[1:48:25] message to give and all the father has
[1:48:29] given me will come to me and he's going
[1:48:32] to preach the word and he's going to
[1:48:34] preach it just like he would be
[1:48:37] it would be in the bible and therefore
[1:48:40] we turn to him now see no matter what it
[1:48:43] would be the word of god comes to the
[1:48:45] prophet
[1:48:46] their interpretation of the word the
[1:48:48] right interpretation
[1:48:50] and i said all of that to say
[1:48:53] brother branham's and what god gave him
[1:48:55] as an interpretation of the word is
[1:48:57] absolutely right
[1:48:59] but you got to understand
[1:49:01] that interpretation comes out revelation
[1:49:04] because remember he was preaching even
[1:49:06] to branham tabernacle and one time i
[1:49:08] think billy paul asked him you know
[1:49:11] how many you think you got got it all
[1:49:13] brother branham said to ben and paul
[1:49:15] only a few
[1:49:17] out of all that preaching only a few got
[1:49:19] it
[1:49:20] only if you understood what he was
[1:49:21] saying
[1:49:23] and that's just the way it is
[1:49:25] everybody might see the pill of fire but
[1:49:27] everybody don't see the voice hear the
[1:49:29] voice
[1:49:31] that's a known fact
[1:49:35] when paul fell down and those people was
[1:49:37] with paul they they saw the pill of fire
[1:49:39] they heard the thunder but they didn't
[1:49:40] understand what was being said
[1:49:42] and that's the thing with the message a
[1:49:44] lot of people read it but they don't
[1:49:46] understand it
[1:49:47] if you miss
[1:49:50] that the message
[1:49:52] is to restore
[1:49:54] us back
[1:49:56] to the position from which we fail
[1:50:00] it's not at your death
[1:50:02] it's now
[1:50:05] god restored brother branham here
[1:50:09] before he died
[1:50:12] you understand what i'm saying
[1:50:14] he was restored here
[1:50:16] he had a hot temper
[1:50:18] remember he lied
[1:50:21] he was going to fight that man over that
[1:50:23] tree
[1:50:24] he was going to shoot those boys he was
[1:50:27] a man
[1:50:28] he had flaws and
[1:50:31] flaws and all that but when it came to
[1:50:32] the word
[1:50:34] that was god speaking
[1:50:38] and i said all of that to say to you you
[1:50:40] might have plenty of flaws but it does
[1:50:43] not declare
[1:50:44] is not a way of declaring to you that
[1:50:47] you're not bribed
[1:50:50] you understand what i'm saying
[1:50:52] because your flaws is not what god is
[1:50:54] looking at
[1:50:56] somebody help me here i mean the wedding
[1:50:58] supper was what
[1:51:00] when you came to the wedding they put
[1:51:01] you on a road that road was the holy
[1:51:03] ghost
[1:51:04] and brother bam said that road was put
[1:51:06] on everybody regardless to what they
[1:51:08] were wearing so that when they came in
[1:51:11] they all look alike
[1:51:14] but it didn't change what was underneath
[1:51:16] that that's where the raptor comes in
[1:51:19] god would change this by body
[1:51:22] he would move the corruption and make it
[1:51:25] incorruptible
[1:51:27] that's god in you
[1:51:30] and then he would cause us to what
[1:51:31] change in a way of dimensional change
[1:51:34] the glory of god father i would that the
[1:51:36] glory that i have with you be with them
[1:51:39] right and you and i must understand the
[1:51:42] glory of god is not because you got this
[1:51:44] face that's shining like the light
[1:51:47] the glory of god is that that light is
[1:51:49] shining through you
[1:51:52] people can see the light
[1:51:54] don't hide it under a bushel he said but
[1:51:56] put it up on a pinnacle somewhere that
[1:51:58] people can see it
[1:52:00] this is not pentecost it's beyond that
[1:52:03] it's where god restores us and little if
[1:52:06] we go walking with him little by this is
[1:52:09] what we don't know how long he not walk
[1:52:11] with god but the bible said he walked
[1:52:13] with god it was found not and brother
[1:52:16] branham said the bride is a type of
[1:52:18] enoch
[1:52:19] and never in the word did you find one
[1:52:21] fault against enoch
[1:52:25] because his life was hidden god
[1:52:28] the bride of jesus christ stands
[1:52:29] spotless
[1:52:31] those of us who receive the holy ghost
[1:52:33] and moving into that perfect yeah that
[1:52:36] perfect that perfection
[1:52:39] that's god
[1:52:41] like being said he ain't beating this
[1:52:42] baby
[1:52:46] you love the lord
[1:52:47] let's stand
[1:52:50] i made it
[1:52:51] 8 59.
[1:52:56] god is so good to us
[1:52:59] i i i i'm zealous for him
[1:53:04] i'm zealous
[1:53:10] the thing that i want most
[1:53:12] more than anything now
[1:53:17] while god is working on me
[1:53:20] i want to be able to
[1:53:22] tell somebody about
[1:53:24] what he's doing
[1:53:29] i don't know a man yet
[1:53:32] who died and
[1:53:33] died
[1:53:35] without flaws
[1:53:38] because our perfectionist is not within
[1:53:40] us
[1:53:41] of ourselves
[1:53:42] is the perfection of christ our lives
[1:53:45] are what hid
[1:53:47] in christ jesus i don't understand it
[1:53:49] all
[1:53:50] but i believe it all
[1:53:53] and i believe with all my heart that god
[1:53:55] wants a a bride that's happy i've never
[1:53:57] seen a bride
[1:53:59] getting ready to be married or whatever
[1:54:01] the case may be and she's got a long
[1:54:02] face and she's so unhappy
[1:54:09] you know even when my wife and i was
[1:54:10] getting ready to get married we're
[1:54:11] getting ready to celebrate our
[1:54:13] 45th or 46th anniversary i forgot which
[1:54:16] it is
[1:54:17] in july the first part of july
[1:54:20] but i could remember the time when
[1:54:23] those there were some girls who
[1:54:26] posed as friends and said they would be
[1:54:28] her
[1:54:29] what they call them flower girls maids
[1:54:31] or whatever they call them
[1:54:34] i'm thinking about a funeral landing
[1:54:37] bribe me
[1:54:41] but you know
[1:54:43] there were some girls who quit
[1:54:46] and they thought they were going to
[1:54:47] interrupt the wedding
[1:54:49] because they were jealous of her several
[1:54:50] of those girls they told people that
[1:54:52] they that i was their husband i'm like
[1:54:54] you knew something i didn't know
[1:54:57] but the point is
[1:54:59] it didn't disturb nothing
[1:55:02] because god already had somebody there
[1:55:04] waiting
[1:55:05] and the wedding went well i think we had
[1:55:08] about 12 people 12 bribe me or whatever
[1:55:11] big wedding
[1:55:12] you know what my wife all we had to do
[1:55:14] was pay for the cake
[1:55:16] all the pictures was paid for
[1:55:18] the church
[1:55:19] gave us a wedding
[1:55:20] we went to the woods and got all our
[1:55:22] flowers
[1:55:24] in south carolina you get all kind of
[1:55:27] weeds and flowers and you decorate it
[1:55:28] put it together it'd be looking good
[1:55:32] and so my wife had like a we didn't know
[1:55:34] nothing about this message but she had
[1:55:35] like a rainbow color
[1:55:37] of gowns everybody had on a different
[1:55:39] color gown
[1:55:41] not even knowing
[1:55:43] and what what made it so so so wonderful
[1:55:46] we we were married in 1977 so do the
[1:55:48] math
[1:55:49] so it'd be 45 years i think
[1:55:52] but in the in in the beauty of all of
[1:55:54] this
[1:55:55] we have come through rough times we've
[1:55:57] had our glorious times we've you know
[1:55:59] you have your ups and downs
[1:56:01] but my love has never changed for my
[1:56:03] wife
[1:56:05] sometimes it gets a little more
[1:56:06] difficult because of the pressure and
[1:56:07] the things that we go through
[1:56:10] uh but listen
[1:56:12] immediately i give my life for my wife
[1:56:14] and my children
[1:56:16] because i know that god gave them to me
[1:56:18] and gave me her
[1:56:21] y'all don't have no idea
[1:56:25] and i don't think my wife had an idea
[1:56:27] either when she married me but she had
[1:56:29] she mad of all the problems
[1:56:33] and so that's why i love her so much
[1:56:35] because she stayed with me
[1:56:38] she stayed with me through thick and
[1:56:40] thin and that's the way god wants to see
[1:56:42] us
[1:56:43] she he wants to see us stay through
[1:56:45] sticky thick and thin no matter what we
[1:56:47] go through we've committed ourselves to
[1:56:49] him
[1:56:51] and that's what a marriage is it's a
[1:56:52] commitment
[1:56:54] lord i love you to death do us part
[1:56:58] and so
[1:56:59] i say these things people i know i'm i'm
[1:57:01] preaching a little different from the
[1:57:03] way i used to preach because
[1:57:05] i i see
[1:57:07] i see something
[1:57:09] and i see god bringing us to a maturity
[1:57:11] by the word
[1:57:13] and we won't have to worry in a little
[1:57:15] bit about
[1:57:16] the gifts and all of the things that
[1:57:18] comes with the word because as soon as
[1:57:20] we come into that place god is going to
[1:57:22] anoint us but it's it's it's individuals
[1:57:27] it's individuals
[1:57:29] you can't you can where the church is
[1:57:31] dead well what part of it are you
[1:57:35] if it's dead bring it to life you'll be
[1:57:37] the live one
