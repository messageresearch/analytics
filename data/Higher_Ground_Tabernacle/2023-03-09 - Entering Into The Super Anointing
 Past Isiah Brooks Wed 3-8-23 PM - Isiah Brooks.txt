service amen glad to have our brother Rich back from amen vacation missed him a whole lot yes I want to thank God for all my song leaders and my musicians amen we appreciate you all by the grace of God yes sir God is good he's worthy to be praised as we stand we'll ask that you turn with us to Saint John 15. we read the fifth verse there Saint John 15. and it reads I am the Vine ye are the branches he that abided in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit amen for without me ye can do nothing amen I just want to thank God for the reading of the word amen amen you may be seated you love the Lord amen amen we appreciate uh brother Keith he had the filters changed and I don't know whether you know how fresh you smell between Crystal and brother Keith is smelling pretty good up in here and all I can say is that I can please I don't feel this funny thing you know so that's where it must have been brother so I thank God for all that you do everybody amen every man the Lord is good to us amen I know we're going to make this announcement not many people here but you know I'm gonna make an announcement that uh we're not giving out no more water if people want water bring it from home yeah then if you leave your bottle of water is your bottle because we've been finding a lot of half dranked Waters I mean I've had reports I think six or seven and then brother uh different ones I don't want to call them names because we don't want to get you in trouble but you know it's sad that uh we we can be so wasteful and I guarantee you if we bought those mini bottles they're still going to be wasteful so bring your own water those brothers who do the musicians you know we know where we can hide them only for the musicians and the song leaders you understand me so if if bottles are left behind we know which one who it is that's Lena you love the Lord God is good to us and I want to thank God for his Amazing Grace amen my wife and I was talking today sometimes God heals you and you don't even know he's it's already done and uh you know just the other day I'm like where's the sniffle you know I haven't used my spray and God knows when and so God totally healed me and then I'm late on his praise but I want to praise the Lord for taking whatever that was out of my science and everything else and I just want to give him glory by the grace of God some of you have been perhaps seeing on the YouTube that there has there has been a great anointing being poured out on the worldly churches and everybody's saying that they are in a Revival but my question would be what are there being revived to see Revival brings you to the word amen it is not a musical Revival and it's not not just an emotional Revival Revival brings you to a change it brings you into a new life but we know what the prophet of God said he talks about it he said when the anointing began to fall on the worldly churches he said they'll believe that they're having a Revival he said and at that time that's when the Rapture would take place he said that same anointing will bring them into the mark of the beast but the anointing and I mean it's the real anointing it will take us in a rapture so we thank God and we praise the Lord uh for all that is being done and one thing for certain I get excited I really get excited because they are doing their part right and we've learned through the message of the hour that salvation does not depend on your organization or your denomination uh it's not your group that's going to go into the rapture we understand that God has an economy and in that economy he has a penny he has a nickel's worth a dime's worth a quarter's worth 50 cents worth and then a dollar and each one of those uh uh money values or values of money plays a part in the economy of God we don't know who's all going to be saved and we don't know who all will be bride but we do know that in the Book of Revelation God speaks of a number that no man can number and you know in the Book of Revelation the Bible says uh what are these uh but if it was an individual thing he would ask who are these or he would put it in a different way but we find out that in this this this revealing of the word we find out that uh the the foolish virgins uh they are from every Kindred every every nation every tongue but they come through great tribulations amen but the Bride of Jesus Christ is receiving her purging now she's being cleansed and and by the grace of God she has received the grace of God by the word of God of this hour amen even as they are being anointed I want you to understand that we know that there will come a Mount Zion Showdown even as it was in the days of the Exodus of Moses you had a resistance that was and they were called Jenners and jambres which represented the organizations of the day but understand that Janice and jambres had an anointing but Moses had a super anointing amen and we understand that it was his anointing that literally swallowed up the serpents of Janice and jambres so God in this last day has promised us a super anointing not just an anointing and this is why I have always been just somewhat irritated at the what I see people calling the anointing or the presence of the Lord and you know how it's so relaxed it is a mature thing but it it it it what comes with it I I heard uh our brother isai say the other day down in Iowa City if the Supernatural is not with you you're not even the church and I thought wow that's powerful yet it is true amen right but listen the false Vine they are producing the supernatural how y'all got quiet on that but they have a faith and the and the god that we serve is the same God in which they serve or let me put this way the god that we serve is literally giving Thee the response to their faith because listen only God can heal God can deliver amen and only God can change right but we understand that everybody has a place and everybody is not bride amen Hallelujah and you and I must be certain that we are the Bible said lest we come short of the glory of God Amen entering into the super super anointing the same super natural God working in his Supernatural Church and when we're talking about a supernatural Church we're not talking about a group of people in other words we're not talking about Higher Ground and Higher Ground only or whatever your name or your church is that's not what God is dealing with God has always dealt with individual woes amen hallelujah but we are called this evening we'll call to to to live up to the truth that we have obtained amen amen right God didn't give us this measure of the word for it to lay dormant amen amen we understand that and the word of God is not the word of God until it becomes Dynamite right the mechanics it's not the mechanics is the word it's the letter and the Bible said the letter killeth but it's the spirit that gives life amen amen and so therefore the truth that we have received that which we have obtained and in all of us are moving forward I trust amen amen hallelujah amen because Paul even said I haven't obtained it yet see but he was pressing toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ amen in other words he was pursuing his goal amen he was Reaching Forward for a to a higher plane and I don't believe that God allowed this church to be called Higher Ground because I believe that it was an inspiration that was given to the early uh people of the church but it wasn't supposed to stop Higher Ground means that a level that you continue to climb amen and when we come to that place where God wants us to be amen we can express without with confidence that we are Christians amen who have achieved a higher level of God Amen amen right but I read that word I am the vine ye are the branches Hallelujah he that abideth in me and I in them the same bringeth forth much fruit for without meat you can do nothing amen now when it comes to abiding that word means to remain or stay and when you see it in the context of this of the scripture Saint John 5 15 5 the vine and the branch is connected they're living from the same Source or off the same source and that source source is Jesus Christ or God himself is that right see God is God and all and he will always remain God Amen amen but if if we're connected to the source of life it will bring life into US amen right you can be an iron you know or any type of uh electronics and all of the electrical powers everything that is that makes the iron ore or or a refrigerator or a stove it's functionable they're working they work but if you don't plug it up if you don't connect it to the Life Source which we call electricity it would just sit there dormant and that's what's wrong with a lot of Christians they're sitting there they they're equipped to bring forth the fire but they are not connected to the source that will put them on fire amen so we need some connection and I realize by the grace of God the connection I'm talking about just does not come by just a nice church service no no Hallelujah the Bible says that God would rather us be hot a cold and to be lukewarm is not something that God enjoys about a Christian is that right amen I I like a hot cup of tea and I like a cold glass of water but I don't like lukewarm water it may be the same but it's something about it that just doesn't satisfy The Taste and The Thirst so is it with God God wants on fire Christians now uh you know my thing is this I have not yet attained but I'm pressing toward the Mark I'm looking for this super nothing because people of God in this age you need the super anointing amen we didn't even know that there was one man until brother Burnham taught us how that God placed him in a super anointing amen when those squares were created he said when that anointed came it almost knocked him off his feet and he talks about it how when he was there with with Hattie Wright and how that super anointing struck him again and from those times from and since uh from that time brother Branham always looked for the super anointed amen he was never a the same again because he saw God and felt God and understood God in a way he had never seen a Felton before and so he you watch it after after those events took place in in the latter tapes before he went off the scene he was always looking for that super anointing amen Hallelujah glory to God but I know where the super anointing is supposed to come on those who call themselves Elisha Elisha right she got a double apportion of the anointing and I believe that is the anointing God wants us to enter into Hallelujah amen see when God gives us a promise he can't go back off of the a promise now people it is not something you and I can manufacture it is God who gives it Hallelujah but one thing God requires and that is a Sanctified life a life a man that's sacred to you is sacred to God he looks for a life that's separated from the world is that right somebody who's giving themselves holy unto the Lord and when we give ourselves holy to the Lord God will give himself holy to us is that right and this is what we're pressing into amen Paul said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me and Paul said listen I crucify the old man on a daily basis Hallelujah I can't serve God just one day I've got to serve him every day when I wake up in the morning I have to crucify this flesh now people I'm telling you as a human being is not so easy hello but it is a laboring it is oppressing it is a pushing because we know by God's grace as we try to push forward Satan is trying to pull us backwards Hallelujah but if the Lord be on your side y'all hear what I'm saying when God is on your side All Things become possible what I'm learning is to always keep a positive attitude hallelujah look at Job the devil tried to bring job into a negative attitude but no matter what trial he went through he blessed the Lord hallelujah he went on to say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord amen naked I came into this world and naked I'll leave out Hallelujah he realized God was always in control no matter how negative things became it came into his life he understood God was his God and he understood amen the blood the sacrifice of the Lamb amen hallelujah I often say to God I say to the Lord Jesus I don't care what it takes do it Lord if I've got to suffer do it whatever is takes for me to make this rapture do it for me bring it on Lord I don't want to come short Hallelujah I know he's God and he'll never change but I also know there is criteria there's a criteria there's a mandate that God is requiring of us and no man in here can do it Hallelujah because none of us can add one cubit to our stature the Bible says it's not him that willeth nor he that runeth but God who shows mercy and that's why I'll be asking God give me the mercy give me the grace of this hour to press through all of this darkness and you and I know this is the darkest we've ever seen it most Christians don't even know what's going on but those of us who have our eyes open may God keep your eyes and heart open Hallelujah don't lose sight of the hour that we're living in hallelujah it's the problem God said go ahead and plant your potatoes but always keep your eyes and looking at Jesus amen hallelujah right he told Abraham he said he would possess the Gate of his enemy think about it and so a man by the name of Shem God y'all believe that amen who look at the odds against him God only needed one man just to let him get one man in his hand and the world would think he's crazy but he would drive home the gospel when he thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ remained the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah unto anything else he will stand true and go on because he thoroughly convinced that God is God Amen see when you're convinced that he's God you realize amen everything is going to be all right yes sir Hallelujah if he ever was God he's still God if he isn't the God he was he never was God that's right he is the infinite God the all-powerful God Almighty omnipotent omniscient in in infinite oh my he's he is God he's the same God that opened the Red Sea he's the same God that brought Daniel out the Lion's Den he's the same God that brought the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace the Hallelujah he's the same God that raised up Jesus Christ on Easter morning he's the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost he's the same God that raised Lazarus out of the Grave he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm convinced that this is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's why the devil don't want us to get the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh my you know what the Holy Ghost is is when God receives you it's not when you receive it is when God receives you amen so when God receives you he gives you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah listen you and I must understand as individuals we we're fighting and and I we're pursuing this Mark this perfection y'all hear what I'm saying we're running after it we want it you know we're like Jacob give me the birthright I need this Holy Ghost I don't care if I got a wrestle with an angel I need this Perfection law see he pursued it yes Hallelujah and how did he pursue it down on his knees he wrestled with the angel of the Lord says I'm going to let you go until you bless me and you know when the anointing of God come in your prayer life don't you leave it stay right there till he bless you take all the worldly thoughts and ideas out of my life Lord remove all the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye of the pride of life move all of this world and this out of me that I may be made whole Lord hallelujah that I might please you see God don't take an idol he takes a man and if he if a man will prostrate himself in the presence of God God puts himself in the man and the man becomes the living creature that God is living in amen not a dead Idol but a man God never use Idols he always used man and God wants to use you yes every one of us in here God wants to use you let me tell you what it may not be something like what Moses did parting the Red Sea it may be just as simple as carrying a few loaves of bread and fish Hallelujah it may be babies like that old widow woman what we call great God called foolishness Hallelujah yes but God sees the little things come on somebody Oh Glory to God is that all right yes Lord amen amen you see God uses a man and man only God doesn't use Machinery he doesn't use groups of men God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always in some reason we get into this message we think oh God gonna oh no no even in this God used individuals amen amen because everybody is not on the same level hello there's a kind of Christian there's a make-believer there's a Believer and there's the unbeliever and they all come to message churches Hallelujah it's the truth Hallelujah this message came to prepare the bride she is being tried in her faithfulness to the revealed word did you know that this is the testing ground that's why we came here God came to try us and the Bride Comes to be tested will she stand on everywhere yes she will Hallelujah why because she has a revelation in her soul that the word is still God Hallelujah I may not understand every every word of this message I may not but I believe every bit of it Hallelujah and I know that the word of God is the word of God and nobody can change it Hallelujah Hallelujah you can be ignorant as a rock but you might know Jesus if you know Jesus Hallelujah you're greater than the greatest man in the world is that right Hallelujah you look at all those great Pharisees and Sadducees that was in the days of John and John didn't hear the lick couldn't hear the lick when it came to ABCs Hallelujah he knew nothing about education but he had God that's right amen and God said by the way of Jesus Christ he said there was not a prophet greater than John the Baptist Hallelujah he was greater than Herod he was greater than the Pharisees greater than the Sadducees see the world looked down on him but God lifted him up Hallelujah is that right that's what God the world may look down on you but in the eyes of God you lifted huh amen hallelujah absolutely man that's why Moses chose not to be called the pharaoh's daughter he understood that what he was dealing with he knew that Pharaoh was just the king of Egypt but the God he met amen was God of pharaoh in the whole world is that right see we must understand that it comes to prepare us we we can't help but to suffer suffering is part of it Jesus suffered we have to suffer but we want to suffer for righteousness sake now not for either doing right preparing the bride means she learns to be faithful and obedient to the word you must learn how to be faithful that means you die out you make a mistake but now I know now Lord what I should do the next time right that's the way that's what listen abiding you know when you abide in him that means you're in him and he's in you right in that day you know I'm in the Father the fathers and me and I am in you amen right there's a union there that cannot be broken Hallelujah there's a union there yes sir abiding in him staying in there and let me tell you what we used to say that old song in that old Pentecostal Church uh stay there stay there be ready when Jesus come stay there stay there be ready when Jesus Come Oh in the word of God be ready when Jesus come I'm gonna stay there stay there be ready when Jesus comes Hallelujah in the word of God I've got a hide in place in the word of God I've got to hide in place hallelujah amen and that's where we we hide in the word of God Amen I gotta hide in place and you know that's I'll stay there stay there Hallelujah in the word of God yes sir when when Satan brings what we call the impossible and he loves to do that and because he works with our natural senses and he tells us that this is impossible and and usually when he brings it impossible to us if we're not spiritual we'll feel overwhelmed and overcome Hallelujah but listen we cannot be overcome because he's the Overcomer Hallelujah and listen when he comes in that way the Bible says already when Satan comes in like a flood we don't know where the flood is like those let's say like let's when Satan comes in like a tsunami God will lift the standard amen amen hallelujah and you know what everybody that's escaped their tsunami usually they run to Higher Ground [Laughter] hallelujah amen a higher place where the tsunami can't reach him Hallelujah you love the Lord absolutely and so when when when the impossible is presented to her she doesn't consider the circumstances you know it's like the woman with the issue of blood she couldn't consider the circumstances and she had done tried everything she knew how to try and everything failed but she heard about Jesus see she got you hear what I'm saying you got to have the Revelation that he is God and when you call on him he will answer prayer amen y'all hear what I'm saying I know it's tough it's never been easy for a real Christian Hallelujah but a real Christian we we fight the battle brother random said it like this he said when they gonna when we get to heaven they're going to ask you what age you you were in and then he said when we tell them we came out of laity or they're going to say how [Laughter] how did you come out of the Legacy hallelujah how did you make it there's only one way I know the Bible said they overcame about the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony you've got to have some testimonies Hallelujah you got to be tried you got to be tested Hallelujah this is part of the program you've got to go through it in order to have a testimony oh you hear what I'm saying David said yay when that lion tried to kill me Hallelujah God gave me Victory yes sir so when the bear tried I slew the Bell because God gave me victory over the lion Hallelujah Goliath and you are next yes sir yes sir I know what God can do I have a testimony that the God that I serve he is God talk about a super Dante Hallelujah yes when the impossible is presented to her she doesn't consider the circumstances no does she consider the impossibilities because we have been taught all things are possible Amen to them that believe amen God don't fail he's never failed and all things are possible amen Amen to them that believe she is she believes in so much she is honed into the word of God can I say it like this she is so hone she's connected to the headstone and The Headstone is the Cornerstone and the Cornerstone is the hair Stone Hallelujah glory to God is that right God sometimes asks us to do some of the most impossible things and some of the things that we we just cannot understand that's why it takes faith Hallelujah you're saved by faith faith in the word right Luke 1 35-38 let's talk about it a little bit and the angel said unto her he talking to Mary the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee now you can't tell me that wasn't a super anointing it doesn't say that but I guarantee you there was something Supernatural that made Mary known that what he had just spoken just happened therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she have also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with God nothing shall be impossible not with God nothing shall be impossible and marriage said behold the handmaiden of the Lord be it unto me that's what I say tonight Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her what was it you don't have to understand it you just need to submit and believe it I don't know how I'm going to be translated I don't know there's no record of how it's going to happen but I believe it I receive it I accept it amen I don't even know I told the Lord I said I don't even know why I said I really don't know why you use me Hallelujah and then the Lord brought me to the message as I would as I was with Moses how God told in that message says God wasn't concerned about Moses mistakes he was concerned about the commission that's right and you got to understand God knows you're going to make mistakes but you have a commission amen you have a goal and that goal is to bring Christ on the inside so he can perfect you bring you to a place of rapturing right amen hallelujah you're gonna make mistakes but in Christ I've got to hide in place is that right my life is hid in Christ so is your life right the story of the little dishwasher y'all remember that but listen this is what the Bible tells us according to Psalms 23 and 5 5-6 is his thou prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over now come on that cup running over is anointing that's an anointing and just not a little bit amen it's running over hello you know if that anointing is on you you just don't sit still amen it does something amen amen mainly on the inside but if it's doing the work on the inside it's surely going to show on the outside surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I like that because here David says you prepared the table before me in the presence of my enemies you set this up Hallelujah you set this up amen hallelujah but in the setting up you anointed me amen David understood that he saw Goliath he was going out to give his brothers food but God prepared a table for him he didn't know he had to battle Goliath when he woke up this morning that morning Goliath was on his mind you understand me sometimes things come to us when we least expect it amen it comes like an atomic bomb Hallelujah but nevertheless under the shadows of his wings I have a hiding place surely he's certain of it goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life let me ask you something with all of your failures why do you still want to serve him because he's got you locked in he's got you locked in he'll never let you go he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I will always be with you see it ain't about you it's about him and whatever he's designed as a trial for you I can't do it for you and whatever he's designed as a trial for me you can't do it for me everybody have their own Hallelujah but if you look over in the revelations when all of the redeems of worshiping God what were they doing they were worshiping him for what he had done and what he will do all the victors that he got in God and all the victories he got before he was God and we come into a revelation to note because of this message we know that Jesus Christ is God amen hallelujah the Jehovah of the Old Testament of Jesus Christ of the new that's not something in your mind it's got to be in your heart amen but sometimes we fail we only fail God because we want to get ahead of God and we try to manipulate God and we try to make God do what we want him to do and God says it ain't happening right remember when when God wanted to heal that young boy he was all folded up and everything else with the little blue jeans or whatever he had on it brother Brandon went to the house told a man about what his house looked like he said Brothers you've been in my house he said yeah just a hour a few minutes ago or something I've been there but the point is he thought he gonna go in there and heal the boy no he had to wait on the vision that's right he had to wait on the vision everything had to be in his proper place before it could happen and when he took the initiative to go pray for that bar on his own the boy got sicker amen and he cried out to the Lord Lord don't let him die but what was God doing teaching him teaching him and that's the same thing God does with us sometimes we try to get ahead of God and God says not so amen amen wait I said wait on the Lord hallelujah is that right yes you got to wait on him and some waiting can be very difficult for people who need patience thank you Lord oh God help us Jesus because everything in the scientific world is so designed to keep us from having patience I know you read on a pack of a popcorn I'm just giving a a thing five minutes or less five minutes three minutes and before the three minutes open you want to pop the thing over to see if it's ready it's sad three minutes y'all understand what I'm saying but our patience right you know we have a I do this all the time you know you want to warm up a sandwich or something and you want to get a few seconds here if you're done yet won't he wait and it's not a good thing it's not a learned how to wait that's what's wrong with little kids now they saw you mature Daddy I want a piece of candy no I want to be the captain wait a minute wait a minute I get it I want you know what I'm saying that kind of attitude shows our immaturity I just had to say it yeah surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I love that that's my scripture surely goodness and mercy because that's what I need every day of my life and I would and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever is that right St John 17 25 26 o righteous father is that right I think about it I think about how Enoch walk with God and nobody else knew what Enoch was doing ever didn't he not look like a crazy man right yes I don't know what he what all he preached but he preached judgment according to Jude the law of the return of the of God right he built a pyramid and I don't fully understand all of that either right but it's still standing it had to stand it had to stand until the day the Capstone come down Hallelujah but this is the hour this is the day that everything is going to burn with fervent Heat Hallelujah the pyramid might have come through the water but it won't make the it won't make the fire you love the Lord O righteous father the world have not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me can I say it like this let's go let's put in an hour day because everybody did not see God sending Malachi 4. that's right everybody could not see that God sent William Branham in our day amen hallelujah but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me Hallelujah I have declared unto them thy name what did Brother Branham come to do he came to restore the altar of God and in order to restore the alt of God he had to restore the name of God Amen the name of God wasn't Baptist it wasn't Methodist it wasn't Presbyterian or any anything like that all those Blasphemous names he had to come restored because some people didn't know he was one person some people thought he was three people three personalities is that right but he had to restore the name of the Lord and the name of the Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah yes he did glory to God I have declared because listen he didn't cast out the Devils by the name of William Branham he didn't cast out the Devils by the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost he cast out the name of doubt he cast out Devils by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen what was he doing declaring his name Hallelujah and we'll declare it yes yeah [Music] man do you understand what we're getting ready into into amen the World Council of churches and all of these people that's going to come against us they're trinitarians and only the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will stand and God as he declared it then will also declare it again I will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I in them Hallelujah you understand me I'm talking about a super anointing God I need it at the time of The Exodus therefore Jan is in jambres Who challenged Moses with their serpent serpent rods but Moses Ross swallowed up their rod Moses had a super anointing his anointing was greater y'all understand when I say anointing i i i i when I'm saying anointing I'm saying Christ Christ it was Christ amen amen who swallowed up everything amen Hallelujah is that right and the Bible says Christ swallowed up death oh death where's your stain oh grave where's your Victory amen you were swallowed up oh Jesus help us Lord Deuteronomy 29 29 it says the secret things belong unto the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belong with to us and to our and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law y'all hear me the secret things belongs to us God said he hid it from the wise and The Prudent is that right even when the prophet of God was here you had all of those organizations denominations we had big big big name preachers but he was a little Kentuckian who never boast of his gift but through him God raised the Dead Open the Eyes of the blind right heal all manner diseases thousands of thousands of people were healed and baptized if the holy ghost at one time you hear what I'm saying and I'm just saying it wasn't a man doing it it was God in the man right but then you've got all of these other people with all of these flowery organizations and I asked the question now where are they and what have they become now who are you we must live up to the the revelation of this message amen that which we have of pain we must live it you understand me and as we strive for perfection Christ must be seen in every aspect of Our Lives now I know what I'm preaching and I know what I'm saying and God hears my heart and knows every desire I have and I believe with all my heart on bride amen so I know that this message has been ordained for me and I have been ordained for this message amen Hallelujah when we see eat to Those whom he has chosen Hallelujah everybody can't see it don't beat them up don't bash them in don't send them to hell don't call them serpent seed because you don't know [Music] huh Esau looked like he was the serpent seed but I mean Jacob looked like he was a serpent seed but it was not even president said that Esau was a better man yep um he backed his daddy's Ministry fed him good Venison and all that good stuff backed him up Hallelujah can I say it like this he was a better preacher but he wasn't the chosen one right help us Lord it ain't got nothing can I say like this it ain't got nothing to do with Deliverance Paul look how how Paul was who could I preach for and Paul said listen everything that I learned I counted done why it was under the wrong inspiration I learned the system way I gotta be free and he that whom the son is set free is free indeed I must be free of all of the systematic worship everything they taught me I've got to let it go that I might learn the ways of Jesus Christ and learn the anointing amen see hey Philip where you going we having a Revival over here where are you going I'm being led are you you're lying where you going I don't know he's taking me somewhere Hallelujah the next thing he was in the desert left the Revival preaching to a eunuch and we don't know what happened to that unit but we know he was saved we don't know what kind of church sprung up after that but we know something happened Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying it's amazing Elijah went to a widower where you going Elijah I'm going over here to this little woman amen being led by God not some system or anything right well how can you do that how can you go with Israel all over here all the Jews on this side and you're going to go to a gentile Hallelujah God told me to go to the Gentile see that's what I'm trying to say you you can't allow your mind to be engaged by people's dogmas and Creeds and doctrines amen y'all better hear what I'm saying we're free hey Matthew 11 25 and 30. he said at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto pains even so father for so is seeing good in thy sight let me tell you all something before I ever knew this message I knew people who lived more holier than some of the folks in the message I know they had the Holy Spirit they lived it and I'm talking about young people who wasn't ashamed of the Gospel I'm talking about people who I when I was a sinner I Marvel at you know in school the stand they would take all of the pressure they had on them that's why people can't tell me you being young oh I'm young and I can't take it yes you can y'all know what I'm saying I think I must have been 19 when God saved me 19 and I never turned back did I make mistakes yes but I never had a desire to go back into the world um even so father for let so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me for of my father and no man nor at the son but the father you know people said well Brothers you're going a little bit too far with this I'm telling you what brother Branham said maybe I'm not quoting him verbatim but brother Brandon treated every man and woman who considered himself as a Christian as a Christian yeah he never de-christianized anybody he may have told them when they were wrong and where they were wrong but he never de-christianizes true no man knoweth the son but the father neither nor any man the father saved the son and to whom the son will reveal him now oh my God that's so powerful he just told you a great mystery The Mystery of the trinity he just revealed to you right there then he goes over to say what come unto me all ye that labor in our heavy laden and I will give you rest is that right so what is he doing he's tearing down the system of the Sabbath we got to worship on the Sabbath day let me tell you something Saturday is not the Sabbath day and Sunday is not the Sabbath day Hallelujah the Sabbath is Jesus Christ in you come unto me every day come unto me and I will give you rest for your soul Joshua couldn't give it to him but Jesus Christ did Hallelujah take my yoke upon you Lord of me that's why we don't celebrate holy days people are still oh you don't celebrate Christian oh you don't celebrate Easter you don't celebrate Thanksgiving or you don't that listen people if you want to celebrate it celebrate it but there is no law saying that I must celebrate these days because everything I need is in Jesus he satisfied y'all understand me and people follow tradition and even the tradition of the prophets and think because I do they do that make them righteous talk to the Pharisees [Laughter] accept your righteousness exceed the righteous of the Pharisees you won't make it and legally they did it right lawfully they did it right sure but they had no life in them take my yoke upon you and learn of me really I'm telling you when you in this message you say oh I don't celebrate Christmas they look at you like you don't curse God you don't celebrate Christmas we ain't going there we're not going to go deep in that because you know and I know when Jesus was born in the season and the time anybody hey you know Catholic did all of that sir all of it yeah all of that yeah people don't want to acknowledge it but it's the truth anyhow take my yoke upon you oh I'm gonna get in trouble and learn them for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find what rest unto your soul for my yoke is easy and my burden is light Hebrew I think the four chapters said be careful unless you all fall short you don't want to fall short he said labor to enter into his rest you know how you labor you pray you keep praying you keep praying you keep praying until God brings a rest you won't have to wonder whether you got it or not Hallelujah you don't know right you love the Lord give me a few more minutes we know the storm is coming and the Bible says according to Matthew 10 28 it says fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell and I'm gonna tell y'all something what y'all see in America in the system and everything that's happening I'm not going to the political thing but I'm telling you they're moving this thing into a one-world order they're moving this thing where you can't buy or sell they're moving this thing into a place and this thing gonna become Christian they're going to be a United of the Catholicism and and the World Council of church well don't say that but I got to say it why I can you know what I'm saying but you need to know that this is coming your way and when you don't accept it what are you going to do in the message my new ministry brother Branham says it somewhat like this and go read it or listen he said as God brought out the children of Israel out of out of uh Egypt and how he fed them and he clothed them he said he will do likewise for the bride sure I believe it do you think that God says whatsoever you say speak those squirrels you you think that God was just that was just a rehearsal that was just something God did to show you there's a super anointing coming the bride gets it she understands it she knows what she's got in her hands but the Bible the word of God said it's going to take strong faith amen Amen to handle the sword of this day Hallelujah oh my God I feel just like shouting John right now listen hearing this message he says talk about Samson he had seven locks of hair that hung down his back which was the sign that he was separated right see when you get those virtues in there whether you like it or not it separates you the divine nature of God in you separates you from the world things that you used to be able to do you cannot do that's when you become a prisoner of Christ Paul said I'm a prisoner I love that man and then one day he was met out on the planes without anything in his hand to fight with by a thousand Philistines think about it most of us would have just fainted those Philistines were men like men like a brass wall great heavy metal over their heads great armor up in front of them Shields and buckles and so forth on to dodge any bullet probably the helmet being an instinct upon their head Samsung had nothing but he still could feel that the promise that God made him was still hanging on his head he could still feel the anointing that's what he said he could still feel the anointing in other words he know that God was with him amen but he felt them locks hanging down around his shoulder he grabbed what he was it what he could find and it was a Jawbone of a mule and he stood with that in his hand and were persistent that it would be the Jawbone or his own arm but it could be the power of the Lord it would be the power of the Lord y'all understand me he knew it wasn't a Jawbone he knew it wasn't his arm he knew it was the power of the Lord and the power of the Lord came upon him and he beat with that Jawbone a thousand Philistines now my wife didn't know what I was going to preach but she showed me on the YouTube where this on the plane this must have been an Apostolic Pentecostal girl whatever she was she had the Holy Ghost and she was just shouting and dancing and they were trying to sit her down on the plane on the plane she cut loose she was on that plane and shouting and knocking and she was out looked like she was out of control but I learned today they said that it took two hours to get her off the plane but when they got her off the plane they realized they had an engine problem and had they taken off with that engine problem they would have crashed you know I said Lord I remember now I don't got a little over here but I remember when I had it like that thank you my God don't touch that leave that anointing alone yeah if she looked crazy let her look crazy but she's having a good time you know people used to be like that and we know what's happening Brother William said that anointing is lifting and we know it is because it's so difficult to get into prayer isn't it you got a labor to get into prayer the kind of prayer you really want you got to stay there stay there and be ready when Jesus come you got to stay there but if that Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you see we're not getting it I'm not even you know I'm looking at this thing and I'm like understand we're not talking about the second person or third person we talking about the person God in you can you imagine but we need it that's our promise the god of Heaven and Earth The God Who created all the galaxies and everything living in a piece of dirt what happens he's omnipotent and once in nippleton comes on in the inside of you you are omnipotent Hallelujah he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your modern bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you y'all know what I'm saying with that anointing when that word is in you when the Holy Ghost is in you it shuts your body down amen thou lust lust of the flesh lust of the eye part of life it quickens your body and your body becomes like it's saved amen amen I believe that that's what I'm striving for I want everything shut down I want everything shut down so I won't have to bother with the devil and when the Devil Comes bothering me he gets disappointed little children because greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world you have overcome who them I'm almost done I'ma stop on this first Peter one through eight I'll read this and there's many quotes I I'll finish up on this the next time I come I minister uh I'll do a part two of it uh we won't be here Sunday because we're we're going down South for a little business the wife and I unless the weather hinders us and if it does I'll let you know but uh brother isai will be preaching here on Sunday morning I don't know whether y'all know that they had their little baby they had a baby boy amen amen amen and so they're really happy Beautiful Boy by picture I didn't get a chance of seeing myself but we went by there and and um just just a wonderful wonderful time the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ I got so happy I'm telling you it's like it's almost like my wife and I had just had a baby we were so happy because the devil said no but God said yes amen amen amen amen blessed be the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ because his great Mercy he have given us New Birth into a living hope now this is the the revised version of it through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and I normally don't read it but it's wonderful and into an inheritance that is imperishable undefiled unfading kept in heaven for you you are being guarded by God's power through faith for salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days you rejoice in this even though now for a short time if necessary you suffer grief in various trials so that so that the proving character of your faith more valuable than gold which do which which though though perishable is refined by fire may result in Praise glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ we handle this message like we haven't even been born again but you know praise and glory and honor supposed to flow out of us the Bible said a river of Living Water a Fountain of Living Waters is to be daily not not just on a Sunday or Wednesday it's supposed to be a daily thing you know I can remember when I first got saved my family ran from me because everything every time I here he comes all they're going to do is talk about Jesus that's all I knew to talk about right restore Me O God restore me yes sir amen though you have not seen him you love him though not seeing him now you believe in him and you rejoice within expressible and glorious Joy let me tell you something that anointing that's anointing everybody it is the anointing of the Holy Ghost but you know what it's like this the true bride of Christ will never allow herself to be manhandled it's something about it when she sees somebody trying to control her she's not going to accept that because she's under the headship of Jesus Christ but that was the early church they saw the deed of the Nicolas and they saw the change in in positioning of the of the laity and now and and they hated that deed and they were persecuted because they hated the deed you know people persecute you when you when you really set people free of these hierarchies that are even forming among ourselves and when you begin to preach like this people don't want you to preach they don't even and listen I I I don't care but I want the people to understand everything brother Branham the Lord brought through the message is right I mean as far as I can see it you know what I mean and I know he progressed and everything else and in in his Revelation and understanding of the word and if you read it and study enough you'll see changes that were being made but everything was glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ I mean he didn't glorify himself at all and he was very careful even when he he used the term I believe that I'm a prophet and sometimes he he he he he uh asked for forgiveness or something for when he was saying so you you got to understand that this this man was so dead to himself all he wanted to to see is Jesus and he was our example our living example for today that we're supposed to be so dead to ourselves all we want people to see is Jesus Christ that's it so listen this character must be proven you can't say I got patience and I got knowledge and I you know the knowledge that we have supposed to be have is so simple the word is God God is the word that's it knowledge is that God cannot fail never will fail man that that's the word could never fail so it brings a Temperance it literally brings a patient wearing that you'll wait for God no matter what the circumstances may be amen it doesn't matter how dark the clouds are you know that there's a son behind all of that see though you have not seen you loved him and though not seeing him now ye believed in him and you rejoice with unexpressibly and glorious Joy I'm I'm gonna say I'm gonna go off on that but I'm gonna tell you by the grace of God there is an anointing and I've got I've got quotes to to back that up but I don't have time to read that tonight but I'm gonna tell you something people the the the the the super anointing is not jumping and dancing though you may do that the super anointing comes with authority it's about knowing God just spoke to you and he just told you what to say and what to do and that's why brother William said the bride won't move until she gets a dust saith the Lord because she's moved into that position well she in Christ has become one and she waits on his command before she opens her mouth and that's where God is trying to bring us in touch in such an anointing you know you know I I don't know whether this was just for the prophet but it just it it gets me when when when when when God says uh you know can I walk with you that that just oh my God you know I as a man I don't know how how I would take it I really don't know I don't know how I would take that I mean of course I would say yes I'll be my mom but I probably fall and roll on the ground for a while I don't know because of my emotions brother random kind of set up a little different from me but what I don't think there's no greater honor there there is nothing and you know I'm a crybaby anyway and there is nothing that I it's beyond my comprehension but whether he ever asked me to do that that's what I'm striving for I'm striving for that kind of relationship that God would feel comfortable walking not just with me but in me that's what I'm talking about and I know this word is changing me I have my struggles but I can tell you what I'm a better Christian today than I was yesterday and the day before you know I have I Stumble I fall just like anybody else is flesh I get attitudes just like some you know what I mean but God is always there to correct me that's what I love about it he's always there to correct me and I want every correction amen everything that makes me right and put me right I want God to do it you love the Lord amen in his time in his time heal makes all things beautiful in his time Lord please [Music] [Music] in your time [Music] [Music] in your time or you you make all things beautiful in your time [Music] Lord my life
