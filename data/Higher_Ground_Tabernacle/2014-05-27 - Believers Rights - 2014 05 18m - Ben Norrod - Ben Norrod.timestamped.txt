[10:49] Exodus the book of Exodus I want to
[10:51] preach to you this morning on the
[10:52] believer's
[10:53] rights believer's rights and how many
[10:56] knows what one of your rights is
[10:59] get drunk on the Holy
[11:01] Ghost drunk folk don't worry about bills
[11:05] drunk folk don't worry about problems
[11:07] drunk folk don't worry about nothing
[11:09] except for where they're going to get
[11:10] their next
[11:15] drink praise the Lord some of y'all look
[11:18] scared to death already Lord have mercy
[11:21] where is he taken
[11:23] us Exodus chapter 16 verse 31 let's look
[11:27] now at the book that Moses wrote of the
[11:29] Journey of the children of
[11:31] Israel Exodus 16:31 and the house of
[11:34] Israel called the name thereof mana and
[11:36] it was like corander seed white the
[11:39] taste of it was like Wafers made with
[11:41] honey Moses said this is the thing which
[11:44] the Lord commandeth fill an Omar of it
[11:47] to be kept for your Generations that
[11:50] they
[11:54] may
[11:56] see I'm happy can't you tell
[12:00] see
[12:02] why that they may see the bread
[12:04] wherewith I have fed you in the
[12:05] wilderness when I brought you forth from
[12:08] the land of Egypt Moses said unto Aaron
[12:10] take a pot put an R full of Mana therein
[12:13] and lay it up before the Lord to be kept
[12:16] for your
[12:17] generations and a message called
[12:19] believest thou this brother Bram said
[12:21] every believer that'll break behind the
[12:22] curtain Yonder and enter into this
[12:24] priesthood has a right to eat of the
[12:27] original Mana that fell on the day of
[12:29] Pentecost a real
[12:32] oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[12:35] blessing and brother Bram says
[12:39] hallelujah let's pray
[12:42] together Heavenly Father how we thank
[12:45] you this morning Lord thy great Mercy
[12:48] Lord where will we be without you today
[12:51] as I just reflected this morning in my
[12:53] fellowship with brother Brooks God how
[12:55] far you've brought us from things Lord
[12:58] that we wouldn't have even realize would
[13:00] have been issues problems difficulties
[13:03] in our life but somehow your precious
[13:05] hand always illuminates that which we
[13:07] need the most and I realize Lord after
[13:10] these years of serving you there'll be
[13:12] many more years Lord that I'll need
[13:13] illumination I'll need your hand to
[13:15] reveal to me things in my life areas of
[13:18] my life that I need to make right but I
[13:20] need to be better be closer Lord as we
[13:22] were talking last night somehow we just
[13:24] feel so disappointed not because of our
[13:26] Revelation or what we believe but
[13:28] because of how we serve you sometimes we
[13:31] want to do our very best for your
[13:33] kingdom I pray today that as you take
[13:36] your word that you will illuminate those
[13:38] areas of our life where why we can serve
[13:40] you in a much greater compacity I pray
[13:43] the Holy Spirit will take his word this
[13:45] morning use your servant today Lord you
[13:47] see my body my mind my thoughts I pray
[13:51] that you would take it under your
[13:52] perfect Supremacy and control that you
[13:55] would use me by your divine grace to be
[13:57] a conduit to channel Your Divine energy
[14:00] to the hearts of your people may the
[14:01] Holy Spirit I pray take them and as they
[14:04] receive may they just connect to that
[14:07] conduit of life may they just engage
[14:09] Lord into the word and may they just
[14:11] Connect into that surge of energy that
[14:13] they might receive eternal life in a
[14:15] greater abundance than they've ever had
[14:17] today encourage the discouraged
[14:19] strengthen the weak May the Holy Spirit
[14:21] heal the sick Save The Lost do all that
[14:23] thy would be pleased to do this morning
[14:25] as we commit the word both speaker and
[14:27] hearer to your hands in the name of
[14:29] Jesus Christ amen and amen and the
[14:33] church said amen you may be seated may
[14:36] the Lord bless you real real
[14:39] good well' you come to get
[14:41] drunk well that's good because I'm going
[14:44] to tell you friends I believe with all
[14:45] my heart this message what we have
[14:48] failed to get the people into has not
[14:50] been deeper Revelation not more books
[14:53] not more tapes not more MP3s not more
[14:55] this that or the other but we've just
[14:57] simply gotten too sober around this
[15:00] message now that's one reason why the
[15:02] devil has so much to say in our minds
[15:05] and our ears and around us every way is
[15:07] because let's face facts we've just
[15:09] sobered up way too much now the truth of
[15:12] it is when we first came into this great
[15:14] truth we was so drunk on the spirit of
[15:17] God that we didn't worry about what the
[15:18] devil said we didn't worry about what
[15:20] preachers said or what deacons said or
[15:22] anybody else said for that matter all we
[15:24] cared about is what Jesus thought and
[15:26] where we going to get our next drink
[15:27] from now one thing we realize is that
[15:30] natural intoxication now I'm not
[15:32] preaching you to go out and go to the
[15:33] bar and get drunk this morning but
[15:35] natural intoxication is a perfect
[15:37] parallel of spiritual intoxication now
[15:41] we realize that the Virgin Mary herself
[15:43] when she came out of the upper room you
[15:45] realize that the the imagery the statue
[15:48] and so forth that we see in many
[15:49] Catholic churches is not the way Mary
[15:51] looked when she came out of the upper
[15:52] room amen we see her standing there with
[15:54] her hands in what they call the power
[15:55] position and a halo over her head and
[15:58] kind of a pious look on her face and
[16:00] she's not really smiling all that smile
[16:01] that goes up to her eyes she just kind
[16:03] of got that half smile you know what I'm
[16:04] talking about and and she just very
[16:07] Reverend very Pious very holy but you
[16:09] realize that's not the original snapshot
[16:12] the original photograph she looked like
[16:14] a staggering
[16:16] drunk praise the Lord now you say
[16:19] brother Ben that scares me to death well
[16:21] then you're on the wrong church this
[16:23] morning amen you're in the wrong church
[16:25] because only the elect of God are going
[16:27] by the Rapture by Holy Fire and it will
[16:30] be holy fire that will cleanse every
[16:33] disease germ it will clear the Earth off
[16:36] and renovate it give it its new birth
[16:38] and it will be the Holy Fire that will
[16:39] bring us back to the original that was
[16:41] given on the day of Pentecost now when
[16:44] we look at this in the book of Exodus we
[16:45] realize then that brother Bram is giving
[16:47] us a parallel as he says that the
[16:49] believer has a right to go get this Mana
[16:51] now of course we don't mean go behind
[16:53] the veil and pull back the curtain and
[16:54] go and find a piece of that original
[16:56] Mana but it's a type it's a parallel and
[16:58] what he's trying to show us is that as
[17:00] Believers that original bread that fell
[17:03] on the day of Pentecost you and I have a
[17:05] right to partake of that bread now we
[17:08] know what Jesus said St John 6 that I am
[17:10] the bread of life and you can eat of me
[17:12] and so forth and we realize that Jesus
[17:14] himself being the bread of life that it
[17:16] was more than just eating the natural
[17:18] flesh of the son of man or drinking his
[17:21] natural blood we realize it's not
[17:22] cannibalism or not that sort of thing
[17:24] but it was partaking of the mystery
[17:27] behind the word now the word of God is
[17:30] wonderful we know that the gospel is
[17:31] part word but remember the gospel itself
[17:35] or the word itself contains a mystery
[17:37] and the Mystery behind that word is the
[17:40] Holy Ghost praise the Lord Paul himself
[17:43] tells us Colossians chapter 1 1267 he
[17:45] said even the mystery the mystery which
[17:47] hath been hid where was it hid at behind
[17:50] the word and the word hid the mystery of
[17:52] what Christ the Holy Ghost in you which
[17:55] is the hope of glory now we realize when
[17:58] Moses when this bread first Falls and it
[18:00] falls on the day on on on the day when
[18:01] these children of Israel are out there
[18:03] in the wilderness looking for bread
[18:04] looking for substance and God reins it
[18:06] down on them that this bread as long as
[18:09] it was out of the presence of the Lord
[18:11] it would breed worms and it would stink
[18:13] but take that very same bread and put it
[18:16] in the spirit and then that bread then
[18:18] would stay fresh it would never get old
[18:21] it would never get stale now take it out
[18:24] of the out of the presence of God and
[18:26] then it sits on the back row and it
[18:27] doesn't clap its hands doesn't raise its
[18:29] hands it's comes in about half backslid
[18:31] you excuse me back here I'm going to
[18:32] pick on you a little bit this morning
[18:34] but it doesn't have any Joy doesn't have
[18:36] any enthusiasm hasn't read its Bible and
[18:38] ain't no telling how long it comes to
[18:40] church when it feels like coming to
[18:42] church it kind of prays when it feels
[18:44] like coming to pray but the bread in the
[18:46] presence of the Lord ain't like that it
[18:48] can't wait for them doors to open to get
[18:51] back into the house of
[18:53] God well praise the Lord not sure what
[18:56] kind of bread I'm preaching to this
[18:57] morning looks like some Ines and some
[19:00] oues now you notice this when you look
[19:02] in Deuteronomy chapter 8:7 now just turn
[19:04] that with me if you will just look at
[19:05] this just a moment now you notice that
[19:07] this bread was only a precursor to all
[19:10] that God had laid in the land for them
[19:12] there was many more blessings many more
[19:14] promises that God had in store for them
[19:16] that he wanted them to partake of but
[19:18] yet you realize that that they was only
[19:21] tasting of uh as it was an initial
[19:24] blessing from God now we have all those
[19:26] experiences in our life there'll be
[19:28] certain people when they start coming to
[19:29] the Lord they'll have an initial
[19:30] blessing a little something God will do
[19:32] this way or that way that will lead them
[19:34] up into the presence of God but once a
[19:37] man or woman goes back in behind that
[19:39] Veil then and steps into the presence of
[19:42] God then that that initial blessing
[19:44] begins to multiply you understand now
[19:47] notice the Deuteronomy 8:7 for the Lord
[19:49] thy God bringeth thee into a good land
[19:51] it is a land of Brooks of water of
[19:54] fountains and depths that spring out of
[19:56] valleys and Hills notice a land of wheat
[19:59] barley Vines fig trees pomegranates a
[20:02] land of olive oil and of honey and
[20:04] notice a lamb with shall eat bread bread
[20:08] without scarceness thou shalt not lack
[20:11] anything in it at all amen and it says a
[20:14] land whose stones are iron and out of
[20:17] whose Hills thou mayest dig brass and
[20:20] when thou Hast eaten and art full then
[20:24] Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for
[20:26] the good lamb which he gives to thee
[20:28] amen now you recognize when the bread
[20:30] fell in the wilderness it was only a
[20:32] testing ground it was a testing bread
[20:35] their attitude toward the falling of the
[20:38] bread determined how much of this they
[20:40] were going to get later on amen that's
[20:43] right amen if their attitude was I don't
[20:46] like that old shouting and that coming
[20:48] to church and worshiping and praising
[20:50] then chances are they wouldn't
[20:52] experience the fullness of what God had
[20:54] laid in store from but for those that
[20:56] could pass the bread test Oh Oh Glory to
[21:00] God those that could pass the testing of
[21:03] bread now remember these same this same
[21:06] bread of Christ that would go in there
[21:08] there would be certain types of bread
[21:09] that the priests would bring into the
[21:10] Tabernacle and they'd have the loaves
[21:12] laying out there in the second quarter
[21:14] the second section of the Tabernacle and
[21:16] in that second part they would have the
[21:18] bread but then there would be the bread
[21:20] of his face now you remember in the book
[21:22] of Isaiah when he says arise and shine
[21:25] for thy light is come talking to us
[21:26] Gentiles the word that he uses there for
[21:29] arise and shine in the original Hebrew
[21:31] means to become the light to rise and
[21:34] become the light of the face the light
[21:37] of the face is that any Wonder children
[21:39] of God that the Holy Spirit appeared to
[21:41] us in 1963 not as a body not as an arm
[21:44] not as a leg not as an ear but he
[21:46] appears to us as a
[21:49] face and it wasn't rocket ship smoke
[21:51] either yeah the prophet said that's our
[21:54] Lord up there and I believe it I believe
[21:57] amen no all of this that they were going
[22:00] to enter into so it was more than just
[22:02] partaking of just the bread itself but
[22:05] it was a testing of whether or not they
[22:07] wanted to enter into the fullness I feel
[22:10] so religious I'm about to shout right
[22:11] now Hallelujah to God glory to God Amen
[22:15] brother Isaiah knows that I go to
[22:16] shaking my head you look
[22:18] out amen amen amen now you realize then
[22:22] that once they got a hold of this Holy
[22:24] Ghost bread that as that priest would
[22:26] enter into that Tabernacle and he would
[22:28] partake today that it would be a type
[22:30] not just for him but for every
[22:33] generation of priests that went behind
[22:36] that Veil could partake of the same
[22:38] bread and it would be just as fresh it
[22:41] would be just as real amen it would be
[22:44] just as good as it was the very first
[22:47] time it
[22:48] fell the rest of them organizations
[22:51] didn't understand what you was haing
[22:52] about well if I had to eat a stale bread
[22:55] with maggots in it I probably wouldn't
[22:57] be too happy about coming to church
[22:58] either
[22:59] amen that's the reason why some people
[23:01] come to church looking like they do cuz
[23:02] they're they're hooked up on Pon juice
[23:05] they're hooked up on Lemon they lemon
[23:06] IVs but brother we're not hooked up on
[23:08] lemons oh no but he said in this land is
[23:12] honey Amen in this land is the honey of
[23:15] that word that brings forth the bread of
[23:18] his
[23:21] face thank you Lord Jesus oh my brother
[23:25] man says every believer that will break
[23:28] my that curtain Yonder has a right to a
[23:32] real
[23:33] oldfashioned Pentecostal
[23:36] blessing say what you want to but I am a
[23:40] true
[23:42] Pentecostal not modern day now come on
[23:46] somebody not modern dayu but I am a true
[23:50] original
[23:53] Pentecostal Oh Glory to God listen up
[23:55] down there devil I'm about to skin you
[23:57] up
[23:58] praise the Lord now notice in Acts chap

[31:41] amen friends where do we get this stuff
[31:44] from in the Bible it's the devil trying
[31:46] to sober us
[31:47] up cuz he knows our rights are behind
[31:50] that Veil back there oh is't it
[31:54] appropriate that you got a veil hanging
[31:56] here into this inner sanctuary
[31:58] that's where Christ comes notice the
[32:00] same power and the church
[32:02] said the same
[32:06] demonstration the same feeling
[32:09] amen that sounded more like an old me
[32:11] than it did an
[32:13] amen now you sure you believe this
[32:15] believer got a rightness veil you sure
[32:17] you don't want that Pimon religion
[32:18] because if you do you ain't got the same
[32:20] feeling but if you want this original
[32:22] it's got the same feeling open B we
[32:26] don't go by feelings really do you use
[32:28] that principle in your marriage maybe
[32:29] that's why your marriage is such a
[32:31] mess huh what if you walked in the door
[32:35] Hi how are
[32:37] you doing good how are you have a good
[32:40] day no you
[32:43] no would that be a happy marriage but
[32:46] now when you've been on a trip you know
[32:47] how it is brother Brooks when you're
[32:48] away and you ain't sing for a little
[32:49] while you come walking in the door let
[32:51] me tell you Song of Solomon is a Boy
[32:53] Scout
[32:58] you know what I'm saying that man that
[33:00] man was a childish game compared to the
[33:04] tapestry that I weave of sweet nothing
[33:06] to my little bride oh when I walk in the
[33:09] door she's got better than eyes like
[33:11] this and teeth like that but I love her
[33:13] so good now how do I show it how do I
[33:15] show her that I love her by my
[33:20] feeling so we've got around the ring
[33:22] this message we come in church and we
[33:24] said teach me something how could I
[33:27] teach you anything in this word and you
[33:30] truly understand it if you're not in the
[33:32] same spirit that it was given
[33:37] in now remember this when John is on the
[33:39] a of patmas he's out in the middle of
[33:41] this alcatra as brother called it if
[33:42] you'll take the circumference the island
[33:44] I think is about 15 miles across it's
[33:46] about 30 miles from the closest place
[33:48] right in the aan sea and all these
[33:51] little CTS and mountains and all these
[33:53] little places kind of a flat but it's a
[33:55] sort of a mountainous kind of a hilly
[33:56] type place little rocky places what we'd
[33:59] say like little mini mountains and have
[34:00] caves little Grotto and they say that
[34:02] John was up underneath this little
[34:04] Grotto when he receiv received his
[34:05] Revelation there were snakes poisonous
[34:08] snakes all kinds of lizards scorpions
[34:10] could kill him in a moment had all of
[34:11] that there was no holiday in there was
[34:13] no Ryan's Buffet there wasn't no clean
[34:15] pairs of clothes there wasn't no maid
[34:17] service or room service there wasn't
[34:19] anything that he could fall back on for
[34:21] the Comforts of Life didn't have no food
[34:23] didn't have no water didn't have any
[34:25] other hope except for death in this
[34:27] natural natur body and John says these
[34:29] words I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[34:33] day now will somebody please tell me how
[34:37] a man in that condition can get in the
[34:39] spirit and we sit here and argue with
[34:40] the preacher the whole time he tells us
[34:42] to
[34:44] shout you know what it goes to prove our
[34:46] stinking rotten attitudes around this
[34:48] message has grieved away the moving of
[34:51] the holy spirit because we have taken in
[34:53] control of our own hands we have taken
[34:56] in control the moving of the spirit of
[34:58] God we've controlled how he wants us to
[35:00] shout how he wants us to live how he
[35:03] wants us to love how he wants us to clap
[35:05] our hands how he wants us to worship we
[35:08] control it
[35:10] all but yet we want to be closer to God
[35:12] but how we want to get closer to God is
[35:14] we want to have a better memorization of
[35:16] what we read we want to read deeper
[35:18] memorize better but if you don't get in
[35:20] the spirit it isn't going to amount to
[35:25] enough well praise the Lord brother
[35:27] Brooks I believe with all my heart
[35:29] people around this message are
[35:30] blaspheming the Holy Ghost setting right
[35:32] and message churches blaspheming God am
[35:35] because they hate emotional
[35:38] worship
[35:40] Hallelujah well you did run well what's
[35:42] the matter some of y'all the word's Amen
[35:44] in case you forgot it that's right I'm
[35:47] still preaching the message go check me
[35:49] out you think I'm off the word check me
[35:51] out go back and look at what Paul said
[35:53] the way that is called crazy that's the
[35:56] way I worship
[35:58] [Music]
[36:01] Glory not the way that is called sane
[36:04] and sober and you see back in Ohio
[36:07] brother Brooks and I kind of hail from
[36:08] in our own way they got in this thing
[36:10] where they all clap in unison you know
[36:12] what I'm saying everybody claps in
[36:14] unison and that's an easy way to keep
[36:16] from
[36:17] shouting because they can clap at a ball
[36:19] game but you don't hear them say Amen in
[36:21] a ball
[36:22] game so you know what people have gotten
[36:24] into formalized worship and that same
[36:27] thing that hits my folks back home they
[36:29] find it in Tennessee find it in Michigan
[36:31] find it all you know what it is brother
[36:33] told us the devil has come into the
[36:35] church and he made a promise to God I
[36:38] will make this church formal and
[36:43] Powerless so when you come to the house
[36:45] of God and resist worship you're giving
[36:47] the devil his
[36:49] wish you are fulfilling the devil's
[36:52] desire in your
[36:55] life so if it's all right with y'all
[36:58] I want to shut him up a little
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:01] bit but says the same feeling same
[37:04] demonstration same Power Glory he says
[37:08] the same
[37:09] action as long as your feet are hitting
[37:11] the ground living holy how about it I
[37:14] don't mean making mistakes now what
[37:15] Satan has done has told you now you
[37:16] better not shout you know you should
[37:18] only shout as high as you live really
[37:20] what does that mean exactly so that
[37:22] means if I'm making mistakes doing
[37:24] things wrong and I'm constantly
[37:26] repenting and the blood of Christ
[37:27] completely forgives
[37:29] me huh that means I can come back to
[37:32] church and Shout right that means I can
[37:34] come back raise my hands amen glory to
[37:36] God hallelujah but you say I make
[37:39] mistakes you're right but the way I live
[37:42] is I
[37:43] Repent therefore I shout as high as I
[37:50] live
[37:53] amen Oh Glory to God now this is the way
[37:56] I want my life to be Matthew
[37:58] 21:22 and all
[38:01] things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
[38:05] believing you shall
[38:08] receive Oh Glory to God now friends that
[38:12] doesn't mean that you got to just burn
[38:13] the walls out of the place but that
[38:15] means that you listen some people are
[38:17] wide open in church like this they are
[38:20] wide open they are wide open I mean they
[38:23] are wide open you could take them to a
[38:25] ball game and they would probably go
[38:29] that's them they're wide open but
[38:32] brother however God Made You sister
[38:34] however God made you give that to
[38:36] [Applause]
[38:38] God but listen to me now don't use that
[38:41] as an excuse to sit there and do nothing
[38:46] either we get angry at people and we
[38:49] lose our temper and we lose our emotions
[38:51] with our temper don't we huh do things
[38:54] we don't want to do say things act in
[38:55] ways we didn't expect to act you know
[38:57] why because whenever we got angry we
[38:59] perceived that what we felt was
[39:02] important I wonder if we reverse that
[39:04] when we come to the house of God if we
[39:06] would perceive that what Jesus wants out
[39:08] of our life is the most important thing
[39:10] I wonder if it wouldn't give us pause
[39:12] and give us an an opportunity to stop
[39:15] and give vent to that which Jesus wants
[39:17] listen to me Jesus wants your
[39:20] worship he wants you to say amen he
[39:23] wants you to raise your hands he wants
[39:25] you to clap your hands he wants you to
[39:26] give your part into the service you know
[39:29] why because once you enter into the
[39:31] spirit he can start revealing himself to
[39:37] you in order for me to talk to this man
[39:40] in genuine Fellowship I've got to get
[39:41] his presence first I've talked to him on
[39:43] the phone for about 20 years now him and
[39:46] I have had conversation after
[39:47] conversation but it's only when we get
[39:49] in the presence of one another can I
[39:51] really begin to feel what he feels and
[39:54] see what he sees you understand me it's
[39:56] only when you begin to get in the
[39:57] presence the real genuine
[40:00] presence come on somebody amen come on
[40:03] somebody it's only when you g would get
[40:06] in the presence of almighty God that's
[40:08] the only way that you can feel what he
[40:10] feels and see what he
[40:16] sees believe us thou this brother said I
[40:18] look down at them children of Israel
[40:19] immediately after that they need food to
[40:20] live on so God rain down food out of
[40:23] Heaven Mana type of the Holy Ghost every
[40:26] morning they went out and picked it up
[40:28] it was good they eat it it tastes like
[40:31] honey they would just lick their lips
[40:33] and eat it I'll tell you this holy ghost
[40:36] that Rains Down was a type of this is
[40:38] the antitype he says it tastes like
[40:42] honey not prons now but honey not lemons
[40:46] now but
[40:48] honey you ever seen somebody stick their
[40:50] hand down in an old jar of honey and go
[40:52] this is the awfulest stuff I've ever
[40:54] tasted in my life they're just sitting
[40:57] there
[41:00] going they got their hand in the Honey
[41:02] Jar they're just
[41:04] licking they love every minute of it and
[41:07] if you try to take it away from them
[41:09] they'll get mad at you do you give me
[41:11] that back that's my jar of honey I'm not
[41:14] going to let you have it you took the
[41:15] one last week this is
[41:17] mine oh the children of God would be
[41:19] like that in the house of God when the
[41:21] Holy Spirit is raining down they say
[41:24] bring it here Lord bring it here I want
[41:26] it I want it
[41:28] let me have that blessing let me have
[41:29] that Taste of
[41:31] Honey amen amen oh praise the Lord
[41:36] Brother B said I've seen the saints of
[41:38] God so drunk on it till they would just
[41:41] lick their lips and
[41:44] say
[41:47] good he says that's right there's
[41:49] something about honey I know some of you
[41:53] non-emotional people I've give you
[41:54] something you can do you can lick your
[41:56] lips and in church you can say um I'm
[42:00] good just lick your lips brother I know
[42:03] what's going on you're eating some of
[42:05] that honey oh I don't know brother Ben I
[42:07] I I you know I read that over you're
[42:09] reading that without being in the spirit
[42:11] your Revelation is breeding worms and
[42:14] stinking do you realize that's why the
[42:15] Bible doesn't enthuse people as they
[42:17] read it while it's in a an unano
[42:19] condition if I can say it that way it
[42:21] doesn't have the spirit on it but you
[42:22] start getting caught up in the anointing
[42:25] oh my brother Brooks was preaching just
[42:26] a little teaching a little bible study
[42:28] this morning I got so caught up I like
[42:30] to shout it amen he was talking about
[42:32] the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the
[42:34] higher he got the higher I got and the
[42:36] more he talked the more I listen I was
[42:39] just sitting there going
[42:42] good Hallelujah you know why I was in
[42:45] the spirit of what brother was
[42:48] bringing but you come to church and you
[42:50] go well let's just see what he'll say to
[42:53] us this morning maybe he'll tell us
[42:56] something good that we can
[42:59] hear I can see you don't eat on honey
[43:02] like you
[43:03] should cuz if you ever get in that Honey
[43:05] Jar honey let me tell you something when
[43:07] you walk through them back doors you're
[43:08] saying I wish he sings Too Many songs
[43:11] come on come on get to it brother Ben we
[43:13] know you want to share that singing part
[43:15] but come on get to that
[43:18] work glory amen why it's honey to the
[43:23] believer could you imagine them sitting
[43:25] there getting so drunk did just sit in
[43:27] the house of God and just
[43:32] [Music]
[43:35] go that's
[43:39] good oh my notice again he says brother
[43:43] he said it's like a Russian Mighty Wind
[43:45] come from Heaven amen he says it fills
[43:48] all the house where they're setting
[43:50] Hallelujah the brother they said the
[43:52] building brother wasn't big enough to
[43:55] hold them amen I believe there's a
[43:58] misconception around the ranks of this
[43:59] message I believe what we see when we
[44:01] see small church I believe we see small
[44:04] churches and we think to oursel well you
[44:06] know small churches represents failure
[44:09] actually I think we're looking at it
[44:11] wrong I think Mt pews is there because
[44:14] God knows we're going to need some
[44:16] shoting
[44:20] room so God don't fill the church up so
[44:23] you have room to be able to spread out

[44:30] Barnyard come on now they've got to have
[44:33] room to spread their wings
[44:35] out glory to God so we look at it wrong
[44:39] we think why aren't why isn't the church
[44:41] full because they're going to take up
[44:42] your Sho room if you lay an empty hand
[44:45] on an empty
[44:46] head come on somebody set a bunch of
[44:49] people in the church that don't love God

[46:29] keth brother B says could you imagine
[46:32] wait a minute sister the Virgin Mary was
[46:35] in there too and she was acting like she
[46:39] was
[46:39] drunk now why don't the Catholics depict
[46:42] her that way why don't we see a statue
[46:44] with marry like
[46:46] this you know why they wouldn't have
[46:48] such a a child in their denomination
[46:51] amen they don't want that they want
[46:52] formalized religion where you come you
[46:55] do your religion pay your money and go
[46:57] home amen do you honestly think that's
[46:59] what God wanted for us in this message
[47:01] just to show up in a church to give our
[47:03] money out to give our time out and sit
[47:05] there in the house of God and not
[47:07] move why do you think Martin Luther was
[47:10] responsible for starting the Reformation
[47:12] to give us back congregational sin and
[47:15] give us back communion with the with the
[47:17] bread and the wine and give us back the
[47:19] worship of the Saints and give us back
[47:21] all of these why do you think God
[47:23] restored it back cuz he wanted you to
[47:25] have it cuz it was in your
[47:28] rights amen it was in your rights as a
[47:31] child of
[47:34] God could you imagine saying that in a
[47:38] Catholic Church could you imagine me
[47:41] walking up to one of the Pope's big
[47:42] sanctuaries today stepping up to the
[47:44] platform and say friends I just want to
[47:46] let you know something our Blessed
[47:48] Virgin Mary ha Mary she's drunk in
[47:53] heaven right now
[48:01] Glory could you imagine saying that to
[48:04] some of them Pious men with them robes
[48:06] on I so thankful God didn't call me to
[48:08] wear no robe I have a hard enough time
[48:10] shouting with a tie unless that's a robe
[48:13] i' tear them up brother amen I get to
[48:16] popping and moving and shaking my head
[48:18] i' blow the collar out I rip the sleeves
[48:20] off glory to God why because that's my
[48:23] right that's my right as a child of God
[48:26] to be follow of the Holy
[48:28] Ghost Hall amen it's my right as a child
[48:32] of God to have this blessed Holy Ghost
[48:37] promise could you imagine saying that in
[48:40] a Methodist
[48:42] Church Baptist Presbyterian or somewhere
[48:47] now why wouldn't you be able to say that
[48:48] very freely because you'd be
[48:50] contradicting the way they
[48:53] act Hallelujah so if you couldn't say
[48:56] that in a message meod IST church
[48:57] Baptist Church Catholic church or
[49:00] Presbyterian wonder if that same
[49:02] attitude hasn't crept in most people in
[49:05] the
[49:07] message well I couldn't say these type
[49:10] of things in certain message
[49:12] churches because they'll say I'm
[49:14] worshiping God in spirit and in truth
[49:17] I'll ask you again what truth are you
[49:19] worshiping
[49:21] by my God is an emotional God
[49:26] do you realize brother R said of all the
[49:28] human emotions that Jesus exhibited when
[49:30] he was here he wept all the time he
[49:33] constantly
[49:35] cried do you know what that means that
[49:37] means some of you big Arnold Schwarz and
[49:39] Egger tough guys you've got a right to
[49:41] cry if you feel like
[49:42] crying I know Mama and Daddy might have
[49:44] called you a but not in God's
[49:46] kingdom my Daddy won't call you no
[49:49] no sir but my Daddy loves you to
[49:52] cry my Jesus loves you to pour out your
[49:55] tears
[49:58] amen the Virgin Mary was under the
[50:01] influence of the Holy Ghost staggered
[50:03] like somebody was
[50:05] drunk if God made the mother of Jesus
[50:08] Christ go up there to receive the
[50:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost before she
[50:11] could get to heaven you'll never get
[50:12] there anything shorter than that so you
[50:15] might as well get the starch out of your
[50:17] collars and come
[50:20] on now you realize my Jesus believes in
[50:23] Bleach but he don't believe in starch
[50:27] he believes in Bleach his blood is a
[50:29] bleach that washes our sins away glory
[50:32] to God he believes in Bleach brother
[50:34] Keith but he don't believe in starch
[50:36] amen get the starch out of your collar
[50:38] and come on he
[50:42] said some of y'all hoping it's going to
[50:44] get better just going to be more of the
[50:46] same see might as well Buckle in I'm
[50:48] pretty much got my feet stuck in the mud
[50:50] and I'm singing I shall not be moved
[50:52] this
[50:53] morning paragraph 182 brother man said
[50:56] what do does that represent to us all
[50:58] right when they all got drunk on this
[51:01] new
[51:04] Mana so we read didn't we see the priest
[51:06] going in the way we see the priest we
[51:08] see him walking in
[51:10] holy
[51:13] holy holy I wonder sometimes the Ringle
[51:17] what reason them Jingle Bells were
[51:18] jingling is because that priest didn't
[51:20] already have him a Nipper to that spirit
[51:21] for he went in
[51:23] there I'm coming Jehovah give me a
[51:25] moment coming you said that's
[51:27] sacrilegious no it's not it's my rights
[51:31] am it's my rights the problem is not
[51:34] what I'm preaching it's our concept of
[51:36] what we believe the true spirit of God
[51:39] is listen I realize there's a lot of
[51:40] fanaticism in Emotion but listen why do
[51:43] we put it on the Shelf all together why
[51:45] do we get rid of emotion all
[51:49] together answer me that question and
[51:51] I'll tell you where the devil's been
[51:53] hiding at for the last 30 years around
[51:55] the ranks of this message hiding in
[51:57] formalism yes sir right do you realize
[52:01] why some of these people are defecting
[52:02] out leaving the message because they
[52:04] didn't want
[52:07] this you can say Amen or not but I'm
[52:10] telling you right now that's the reason
[52:12] they're leaving the message because they
[52:14] didn't want this they didn't want it
[52:17] they didn't want that Holy Ghost unction
[52:19] they didn't want the power of God where
[52:21] they lose control and fly out that Holy
[52:24] Spirit inspiration and unction of God
[52:26] they didn't want
[52:28] it so they come to church trying to
[52:30] reform themsel like a good Catholic or a
[52:32] good Methodist setting in a message
[52:34] church
[52:37] amen and never understood what brother
[52:39] bradam really taught it isn't just a
[52:42] recent Pastor that most everybody knows

[52:58] prophet William Brandon he said brother

[53:03] church for better than 30 years and
[53:05] never believed in the right way that I
[53:07] should have believed because it was
[53:10] false it was a bunch of Lies he said and
[53:12] you know where they're getting their
[53:13] information they're going to the
[53:15] internet listen to me carefully the
[53:17] internet is neither good nor bad it is

[53:25] this little tablet I use for my sermon
[53:26] notes it is neutral it's what you use it

[57:37] screen and accept what they say but
[57:40] that's the spirit that's behind these
[57:41] men they want you to sit there and you
[57:43] feel the pressure coming from that demon
[57:45] anointing you must accept it you must
[57:48] accept it it must be the truth it's got
[57:50] to be the truth and you sat there under
[57:52] that pressure but listen to me in the
[57:54] name of Jesus Christ as a Son of God I
[57:57] reject their interpretation I refuse I

[58:31] you know everybody's really under all
[58:33] this fanaticism all these people are
[58:35] really being deceived they're really
[58:38] being deceived but as a Son of God I
[58:41] felt the Holy Ghost moved to me the
[58:42] other day brother Brooks and I felt the

[58:47] you reject and I said to the Lord as a
[58:50] Son of God I reject I reject I do not
[58:55] have to obey or listen to what they say
[58:58] would I rather obey men or obey
[59:01] God that's the true Pentecostal
[59:06] blessing i reject what they have to say
[59:10] I reject their interpretation of this
[59:16] message you can go right to brother
[59:18] Ram's own life story and you can find
[59:21] discrepancies in his
[59:23] dates for brother B to have the vision
[59:25] of the bridge he told it he'd have had
[59:27] to been 14 years old not seven I can
[59:30] find where brother Brandon misquoted
[59:31] dates I can find where brother Brandon
[59:33] made errors in his understanding but
[59:35] that didn't stumble me not one
[59:39] bit you know why not because of a man
[59:42] that could remember the day or remember
[59:44] a time period but when I go to looking
[59:47] in that
[59:48] word oh bless the Lord hold my soul and
[59:51] all that is within me when I go to
[59:53] looking in that word you tell me it's
[59:56] serpent seed right or
[59:58] wrong I accept that the serpent had a
[1:00:01] seed you go to looking in the word tell
[1:00:03] me if that Jesus is one person or three
[1:00:06] I accept that Jesus Christ is the
[1:00:08] fullness of the godhead
[1:00:11] bodily tell me where women preachers
[1:00:13] show up in the Bible I accept that
[1:00:15] brother badam preached the truth just as
[1:00:18] Paul preached

[1:00:21] it I accept water baptism in Jesus
[1:00:25] Christ's name I accept that a woman
[1:00:27] can't cut her hair I accept that a man
[1:00:29] can't live in
[1:00:31] adultery I accept
[1:00:34] Holiness I said I accept
[1:00:39] Holiness I reject their idea that
[1:00:42] there's freedom in such
[1:00:44] things and I accept the truth of the
[1:00:47] Bible that says without Holiness without
[1:00:49] Holiness no man shall see the
[1:00:54] Lord this is my my
[1:00:57] rights and let me say to you Church of
[1:01:00] the Living God listen to me carefully
[1:01:03] and you just remember some little idiot
[1:01:05] prophesied to you before this church is
[1:01:08] ever going to move Beyond this critical
[1:01:09] spirit she's going to have to receive
[1:01:12] the same behaviors that they did in Acts
[1:01:14] chapter 4 amen amen if you will study in
[1:01:17] the fourth chapter of Acts at the first
[1:01:19] persecution of the church when the
[1:01:21] church was being criticized not by
[1:01:23] message people but by critics on the
[1:01:27] outside when they were being persecuted
[1:01:30] then the Lord Jesus himself was waiting
[1:01:32] for them to pray and ask God to fill
[1:01:35] their mouth with boldness that they may
[1:01:40] speak now listen to me if we're ever
[1:01:43] going to overcome that devil that's
[1:01:45] assaulted this message Jesus is waiting
[1:01:48] on you to
[1:01:52] pray you have not cuz you ask not but if
[1:01:56] you want this original then you're going
[1:01:58] to have to get down on your face before
[1:01:59] God and start praying as they did and
[1:02:02] saying Lord fill my mouth with boldness
[1:02:06] that I may
[1:02:10] speak remember one of those Sevenfold
[1:02:13] personages of Jesus Christ was the
[1:02:15] living voice remember the voice that
[1:02:18] preceded forth out of his mouth the
[1:02:21] voice was not just the repeating of
[1:02:23] scripture but it was the living voice
[1:02:26] it was the same voice that called
[1:02:28] Lazarus from the dead it was the same
[1:02:30] voice that created the sun moon and
[1:02:32] stars and remember brother said this
[1:02:34] bride would become the final
[1:02:37] voice not just a voice that repeats
[1:02:40] scripture but she would become the
[1:02:42] living voice of
[1:02:45] God now Jesus is sitting in heaven and
[1:02:48] saying children just
[1:02:51] pray just ask me to fill your mouth with
[1:02:55] boldness
[1:02:59] you just remember before it happens when
[1:03:02] saints of God in this message go to
[1:03:03] asking him for boldness our Jesus is
[1:03:06] going to come to battle like you've
[1:03:08] never seen
[1:03:10] before you know why because this last
[1:03:13] day shaking is running all them formal
[1:03:15] little parasites out
[1:03:18] here hallelujah oh Brethren you notice
[1:03:21] every time Jesus went to telling his
[1:03:23] disciples the most intimate details of
[1:03:25] him
[1:03:26] he always got him away from the crowd
[1:03:28] amen and pulled him to a secret chamber
[1:03:31] by
[1:03:32] himself you think you've heard things
[1:03:35] yet you just wait till leave thins this
[1:03:37] crowd out a little bit more and then
[1:03:39] Jesus will tell us things out of his
[1:03:41] very own heart out of his very own heart
[1:03:43] brother Brooks that we've never heard
[1:03:45] before in our life my God my God do you
[1:03:48] understand what's getting ready to drop
[1:03:50] on the elect it will be more than just a
[1:03:52] revelation of a prophet more than just a
[1:03:54] revelation of a bride
[1:03:56] but it will be the very living voice
[1:03:58] speaking out of the mouth of the
[1:04:06] people you say what do this got to do
[1:04:08] with being drunk I don't know but it's
[1:04:11] good anyhow I'll stay with
[1:04:15] it
[1:04:17] amen he says all right they got drunk on
[1:04:20] that new Mana Moses never said bake a

[1:11:14] ears listen at this statement enticing
[1:11:18] Spirits brother B says here is men and
[1:11:20] women kneeling here at the altar they
[1:11:23] have been Christians for years
[1:11:26] years I'm not UNC christianizing them
[1:11:30] but what I'm trying to do is tell them
[1:11:32] that the devil is haunting them trying
[1:11:36] to keep them out of full
[1:11:42] Joy so that's why when some people come
[1:11:45] to church they
[1:11:46] feel they feel like they can't they feel
[1:11:50] like they can't raise they feel like
[1:11:52] they can't Rejoice you know what that is
[1:11:55] that's a devil standing there haunting
[1:11:58] you you better not you better not the
[1:12:02] minute you start moving people will
[1:12:04] thank your thank you what
[1:12:15] Christian
[1:12:19] Glory praise the
[1:12:22] Lord let the devil know what your
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:28] ass if you went to a ball game and the
[1:12:32] Cincinnati Reds were playing their their
[1:12:34] big rivals the St Louis Cardinals and I
[1:12:36] know because that's all the talk they
[1:12:38] talked about time and time and time
[1:12:39] again when I used to work the SEC job
[1:12:41] that is and they'd have this rivalry
[1:12:44] could you imagine a real Cincinnati Red
[1:12:47] leg fan I mean just a died in a wool red
[1:12:50] leg fan he is a genuine red leg they
[1:12:53] were the first baseball team bless God
[1:12:56] they're the
[1:12:57] best and the St Louis Cardinals got up
[1:13:00] there and they pitched them the fastest
[1:13:02] fast ball they could pitch and one of
[1:13:04] their star hitters gets a hold of it and
[1:13:06] knocks the cover off the ball nothing
[1:13:09] but a little string of yarn just
[1:13:10] floating out in outer space could you
[1:13:13] imagine that real dyed in the wool fan
[1:13:15] sitting there and
[1:13:22] going that's it I'm done that's what
[1:13:24] they do
[1:13:28] would you sit over there in the corner
[1:13:30] and
[1:13:31] say that guy's a real
[1:13:33] fan he really loves the Cincinnati RS he
[1:13:37] loves them look at him he's got his hat
[1:13:39] right his dress is right he's got Reds
[1:13:41] material all over him but wouldn't you
[1:13:43] begin to wonder if he was covered from
[1:13:45] head to toe in Reds paraphernalia if
[1:13:47] when they hit that big major home run if
[1:13:49] he didn't move would you
[1:13:53] wonderen amen
[1:13:56] now the world has better sense than we
[1:13:59] do because they know that when they get
[1:14:01] these starchy bunch of people into the
[1:14:03] into the arena that in order for them to
[1:14:05] get happy enough to scream at them
[1:14:06] places they have a guy going around
[1:14:08] going beer
[1:14:14] here that's what I'm doing this morning
[1:14:17] Jesus here Jesus here anybody want Jesus
[1:14:23] anybody want a temp of that Holy GH
[1:14:25] house glory to God anybody want the
[1:14:27] power of the Pentecostal
[1:14:31] Revival you let them get drunk
[1:14:34] enough and you know what they'll get so
[1:14:37] drunk that before long they'll be
[1:14:39] shouting for the wrong
[1:14:42] team man man sit down that's the wrong
[1:14:45] boy I don't
[1:14:49] care glory to God they know get them
[1:14:52] full of spirits
[1:14:57] and they'll
[1:14:59] rejoice and that's the principle I'm
[1:15:01] trying to preach to you this morning get
[1:15:03] full of the
[1:15:04] spirit and then you will bless the Lord
[1:15:07] your
[1:15:11] God can I go a bit further thank you
[1:15:13] appreciate
[1:15:16] it go quick don't give them a chance to
[1:15:18] say no I'm having too good of a time I
[1:15:21] don't want to quit
[1:15:22] either brother B says he's haunting them
[1:15:25] keeping them out of full joy and listen
[1:15:26] to this remark full Joy so full Joy
[1:15:29] wasn't just sitting there hearing the
[1:15:30] prophet preach full Joy wasn't just
[1:15:32] kneeling at the altar at the feet of a
[1:15:34] prophet of God worshiping and asking God
[1:15:36] to help you but full Joy was them moving
[1:15:39] into the full
[1:15:41] abundance listen at brother bram's very
[1:15:43] next words if you doubt that he's
[1:15:44] talking about emotion listen to this
[1:15:46] very next sentence he said the Holy
[1:15:48] Ghost is Joy I wake up
[1:15:53] drunk I go to bed drunk
[1:15:55] drunk I'm drunk all day long and I'm
[1:15:59] drunk all night
[1:16:01] long so if you thought brother Ram's
[1:16:03] definition of full Joy was deeper
[1:16:05] Revelation you're wrong you're wrong it
[1:16:08] wasn't a deeper understanding of a
[1:16:10] mystery praise the Lord amen it wasn't
[1:16:13] well I memorized this and I was able to
[1:16:14] put this Doctrine together and I figured
[1:16:16] out how this quote fits with that quote
[1:16:18] but it was the Revelation itself from
[1:16:20] Christ not just a mental Revelation but
[1:16:22] it was the depth of how that revelation
[1:16:25] ation affected the human
[1:16:26] heart and once that Revelation began to
[1:16:29] move and turn brother said I wake up
[1:16:32] drunk I go to bed drunk I'm drunk all
[1:16:35] day and I'm drunk all night amen listen
[1:16:37] some of you people have trouble with
[1:16:39] these filthy dreams that the devil puts
[1:16:40] on us sometimes if you would go to bed
[1:16:43] drunk that' take care of your dreaming
[1:16:46] problems we all have them we all have
[1:16:49] them because if the devil can't get you
[1:16:51] while your eyes are awake he'll awake
[1:16:52] he'll wait till you go to sleep to
[1:16:54] attack you but if you go to bed
[1:16:56] drunk amen if you go to bed drunk the
[1:16:59] devil can't assault you
[1:17:03] there Psalm
[1:17:05] 348 notice what he
[1:17:09] says I'm going wait let Randy get it up
[1:17:11] it's too good to speed on by Psalm 348
[1:17:25] Hallelujah isn't it amazing when you get
[1:17:27] in the spirit I don't even have to
[1:17:28] explain it to
[1:17:32] you amen
[1:17:36] [Laughter]
[1:17:40] hallelujah thank you Holy
[1:17:42] Ghost I didn't have to tell you one
[1:17:45] thing all you did is read I never said a
[1:17:48] word you know why you got it cuz you're
[1:17:51] in the spirit
[1:18:00] I'm not even going to comment on it
[1:18:02] Proverbs Chapter 24:
[1:18:04] 13 notice Proverbs chap
[1:18:08] 24:13 watch this next
[1:18:11] verse my son
[1:18:26] don't eat it because it makes you deeper
[1:18:28] don't eat it because it gives you a
[1:18:30] better understanding the message just
[1:18:31] eat it because it's
[1:18:36] good s Solomon Chapter 2
[1:18:39] verse3 Song of Solomon Chapter 2:3 this
[1:18:42] is actually kind of fun I don't get to
[1:18:44] add actually this is the first time I
[1:18:46] I'm preaching without having to preach
[1:18:48] this is kind of nice figure out how to
[1:18:51] make this work all over the country
[1:18:52] would be business won't so Song of
[1:18:55] Solomon Chapter 2:3 read
[1:19:08] it some of you slower readers than
[1:19:10] others I
[1:19:11] understand now this this is what Jesus
[1:19:14] wants for us friends he wants us to have
[1:19:16] that kind of relationship where we sat
[1:19:19] down under the tree not so we can become
[1:19:21] more educated but because we can taste
[1:19:23] of sweet
[1:19:27] FL praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:19:30] listen to this in The Exodus message
[1:19:32] brother man says notice when we're all
[1:19:33] eating that Mana he said they got drunk
[1:19:36] just as drunk as they could be he said
[1:19:38] staggering like drunk men listen my
[1:19:40] Catholic friend the Virgin Mary is with
[1:19:42] them if she had to get that before she
[1:19:43] entered into heaven how much more you're
[1:19:45] going to have to have it you know what
[1:19:46] the trouble is the reason we're so
[1:19:48] allergic to so many
[1:19:51] things we don't get drunk enough

[1:19:58] that now my sister-in-law Rebecca is
[1:20:01] allergic to mold if she walked into this
[1:20:03] building and smelled it in the air she
[1:20:06] would break out all over she's terribly
[1:20:08] deafly allergic to mold but they in
[1:20:10] order to keep her from having an
[1:20:12] allergic reaction they must pump her
[1:20:15] full of
[1:20:19] inoculation and once she's full of
[1:20:21] inoculation she can walk anywhere
[1:20:23] there's mold
[1:20:25] and just
[1:20:26] smile and just
[1:20:28] grin that's the reason we have so many
[1:20:30] allergic ladios
[1:20:32] reactions come on now that's the reason
[1:20:35] we have so many allergic reactions in
[1:20:37] lady OA because we're not full enough

[1:23:40] much more than that for
[1:23:43] us foreal let me read this in this close

[1:24:17] hand did you look at them like a
[1:24:18] copperhead getting ready to bite its
[1:24:21] prey praise the Lord huh did you show
[1:24:25] yourself did you make yourself available
[1:24:27] that they'd be the kind of person that
[1:24:28] you could be the kind of person that
[1:24:29] they could approach or was y'all slum
[1:24:33] over nobody loves me nobody cares for
[1:24:38] me but listen brother B says it brings a
[1:24:42] person all slumped down to a
[1:24:46] stimulation now there's a power of the
[1:24:48] revelation of the word that gives
[1:24:51] stimulation of Joy to the believer amen
[1:24:55] this is brothery he says stimulation of
[1:25:01] satisfaction stimulation that has been
[1:25:04] Vindicated stimulation that has been
[1:25:06] proved and it's called as the scriptures
[1:25:08] we want to refer to it that's new
[1:25:12] wi so you mean to tell me I can have a
[1:25:14] stimulation and be satisfied amen I can
[1:25:17] have a stimulation and know and know
[1:25:19] that it's been Vindicated amen why would
[1:25:21] brother B say these words if he didn't
[1:25:23] know we would need him later on if the
[1:25:24] Holy Ghost didn't know we would need
[1:25:25] them in the hour that everybody's
[1:25:27] questioning Vindication why would
[1:25:29] brother B say these words like this the
[1:25:31] Holy Ghost let him do because when a
[1:25:32] person gets drunk on new wine they will
[1:25:34] be satisfied and so drunk on the
[1:25:37] Vindication of the
[1:25:39] word he said we like to refer to it
[1:25:42] these are drunk on new wine he said or
[1:25:44] spiritual wine I think the best
[1:25:46] interpretation would be spiritual wine
[1:25:48] so stimulation Revelation produces
[1:25:51] stimulation so the more revelated people
[1:25:53] should be the more stimulated people
[1:25:57] that's the more revelated people should
[1:25:59] be more the stimulated people the more
[1:26:01] revelated people should be the more
[1:26:02] stimulated people the more revelated
[1:26:04] people should be more assimilated people
[1:26:06] the more revelated people should
[1:26:15] Beall I know I'm not very fair preacher
[1:26:18] am I just pin you down and don't let you
[1:26:22] move so why is it then the people around
[1:26:25] the ranks why are they the less
[1:26:27] stimulated and yet they claim to be the
[1:26:29] more
[1:26:30] revelated they got more Revelation than
[1:26:32] they've ever had and they're more
[1:26:34] miserable than they've ever been they've
[1:26:36] got more truth than they've ever had and
[1:26:38] they're more sad than you've ever seen
[1:26:40] in the life they just walk around just a
[1:26:43] big old thing on their face all the time
[1:26:46] people actually believe there are people
[1:26:48] that actually believe I secretly take
[1:26:50] drugs did you know that they do there
[1:26:54] are people that
[1:26:56] believe that I secretly take drugs they
[1:26:59] believe that they've even said I it's
[1:27:02] got back to me word through some of my
[1:27:03] closest friends there is no way any
[1:27:06] human being can smile like he smiles and
[1:27:08] not be on
[1:27:15] something
[1:27:16] amen you know what I said I said they're
[1:27:19] exactly
[1:27:21] right but I don't just secretly get
[1:27:24] hooked
