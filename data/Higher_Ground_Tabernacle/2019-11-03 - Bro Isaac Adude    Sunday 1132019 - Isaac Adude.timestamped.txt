[30:17] Jesus Christ to be here in your presence
[30:19] Lord now Lord Jesus we ask you to bless

[30:42] bless the entire church of God and bless
[30:44] us O Lord Jesus in Jesus Christ's name
[30:47] we pray amen let's open our Bible to the
[30:52] book of Romans chapter 8 we read from
[30:57] verse 35 to 39
[31:13] the Bible says who shall separate us
[31:16] from the love of Christ shall
[31:18] tribulation or distress or persecution
[31:21] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[31:25] as it is written for as it is written
[31:30] for thy sake we are we are killed all
[31:32] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[31:35] for the slaughter nay in all these
[31:39] things we are more than conquerors
[31:41] through him that loved us for I am
[31:44] persuaded that neither death nor life
[31:47] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[31:50] nor things present nor things to come
[31:53] nor height nor depth nor any other
[31:57] creature shall be able to separate us
[31:59] from the love of God which is in Christ
[32:01] Jesus our Lord amen let's go again to
[32:04] 2nd Kings second Kings verse of chapter
[32:10] 19 verse 9 to verse 13
[32:30] second king or chapter 19 verse 9 to
[32:33] verse 13
[32:49] the Bible says and now we'll make the
[32:51] house of Ahab
[32:53] like the house of Jerome that's not the
[32:58] right one
[33:03] chapter 9 I wasn't chapter 7 chapter 9
[33:10] verse I wrote the wrong future we can
[33:22] have a we can't we can't sit down thank
[33:26] you I wrote the wrong the wrong
[33:27] scripture so duh we think first of
[33:32] brother boots for the trusting you think
[33:35] brother Troy in the church for having us
[33:38] today and tonight but this morning we'll
[33:41] be speaking on we've been made more than
[33:44] conquerors because as we know as
[33:47] Christians sometimes we have to go to
[33:49] trials sometimes we have to go through
[33:52] tribulations but we have as we read in
[33:55] Romans chapter 8 God we have been made
[33:59] more than conquerors through Christ the
[34:01] scripture that we wanted to read and
[34:03] second Kings was talking about this King
[34:06] his name was was talking about the story
[34:09] of Ezra kaya and the king that the name
[34:12] of the King were was attacking them was
[34:15] his name was a Sennacherib and then
[34:21] their ducky came and then he started to
[34:25] he first sent his messengers to our
[34:28] izakaya telling him that you know what I
[34:30] know that you trust your God but I want
[34:32] to tell you one thing that your God will
[34:33] not be able to to deliver you from my
[34:36] hands because I would kill you and I
[34:38] would destroy all Israel and then when
[34:40] the messenger came to Hezekiah and he
[34:43] gave doubt the message as a guy about
[34:46] received a message and Hezekiah now when
[34:48] you read this you went to the Lord
[34:51] that's why sometimes when we have hard
[34:53] times that's why we sometimes when we
[34:55] have troubles when we have trials our
[34:57] first things that we have to go is to go
[34:59] to the Lord because the Lord is a
[35:02] Solutions caused by ourselves we're not
[35:04] able to overcome it ourselves we now
[35:06] able to fight against all things that
[35:08] that the devil is attacking us
[35:10] now the king being there in these
[35:13] situations you know having nothing to do
[35:15] you know he found himself powerless
[35:18] before that king and he found himself
[35:20] that you know I have no strength to go
[35:22] fight that King and then you know you
[35:24] say about well I know one thing I have a
[35:26] God you know that King began to
[35:30] challenge that God that King you know it
[35:32] began to tell if you know what I've
[35:33] destroyed all the nations surrounding me
[35:36] he began to tell them you know what I've
[35:37] destroyed you know all the nations I
[35:40] love this road that the more abiding all
[35:42] those kings they had also their gods but
[35:45] I destroyed them and I want to tell you
[35:47] something that your God will not be able
[35:49] to say you know to get you away of out
[35:52] of my hands because I would kill you all
[35:53] and that came when you receive that
[35:55] message he went to the Lord he went to
[35:57] the Lord he said Lord you know what it
[35:59] is true that he destroyed everything it
[36:02] is true that he destroyed all the gods
[36:04] it is true that he destroyed all the
[36:07] nations that were surrounding him but
[36:09] there's one thing those gods were made
[36:11] by man those God were not the true God
[36:14] but I served the true God you know who
[36:17] created everything we created you know
[36:19] that the heavens and earth the Seas
[36:21] there the animals the birds and
[36:24] everything and I served the true God and
[36:26] he said lord I want you to come and
[36:28] fight for me Lord I want you to come in
[36:31] and fight my battles and there and stand
[36:34] there and and then the Lord if you read
[36:36] the other day the entire chapter you
[36:38] find out the Lord began not to tell him
[36:41] to remind him what it did he first
[36:43] started to tell them you know what you
[36:45] what you did wrong and you know how the
[36:47] version of Israel should behave and how
[36:51] they didn't behave but by the end of the
[36:53] chapter the Lord said the Lord told me
[36:56] said you know what I will come and I
[36:57] will fight your battles you know I
[36:59] despite everything that you did I would
[37:02] come and I would fight you about why
[37:03] because you are knowledge to God you all
[37:05] know less God and then God came there
[37:08] and if our ain't God fought for him God
[37:11] killed every guy killed all the all DSE
[37:15] and then arriving there that key escaped
[37:19] that came ran away but Lord as he defied
[37:23] it as he challenged God God wanted God
[37:25] had to show him that you know I am the
[37:27] true God those God that you worship that
[37:29] you killed and those nations that you
[37:32] destroy you know where Nasser said I
[37:34] said serving the true God now there is a
[37:37] difference between me between those gods
[37:40] made by man and the true God that was
[37:42] served and then God you know and then
[37:44] when you he ran away and he found
[37:47] himself not worshiping the idols and
[37:50] then two of his children came to him and
[37:53] and they killed him you know it's to
[37:55] show that we're surfing a true God I
[37:57] don't know what you're going through
[37:59] this morning I don't know what how you
[38:01] know how hard the time is for you I
[38:03] don't know how you know what what
[38:05] difficulties you have or what problems
[38:07] you have but I want to tell you that
[38:09] we're serving the true God you know
[38:10] though the devil can come to you and
[38:12] challenge you with sickness though the
[38:14] devil can come to you and challenge you
[38:16] with the problems you know in your
[38:18] family and everywhere is schoolwork you
[38:20] know you feel like everything nothing is
[38:22] going on but I want to tell you one
[38:24] thing that we serve a true God that we
[38:26] serve a God that if we run to him and if
[38:29] we had another gym he will come and then
[38:32] he will fight for us and then we find
[38:35] then we were seen the Bible we see the
[38:37] story of Gideon Gideon was a man and the
[38:40] Bible as the Bible tells the story we
[38:42] found out that Gideon was not even able
[38:44] to fight he never fought before and then
[38:47] he found themselves in the situation
[38:49] where they had war in the country that
[38:52] everything was what was wrong in the
[38:54] country and then God came now Gideon I
[38:57] tell you you know you are a mighty man
[38:59] of Valor you know stand up and I will
[39:01] use you to fight stand up and I will use
[39:04] you you know to fight this battle you
[39:06] know that's why the yeah you know you
[39:08] get here was a young people that's why
[39:10] ourselves even young people I know we
[39:12] cannot say you know that you know I'm
[39:14] young and I cannot serve the Lord there
[39:15] are me young and God cannot use me
[39:18] Gideon was a young people here was a
[39:20] young man and then God used him you know
[39:23] why because the name of God was
[39:25] challenged and every time by the name of
[39:27] God is childish God
[39:29] has to use someone who would be willing
[39:30] you know to take up the challenge and to
[39:33] fight the devil you know these schemes
[39:35] and this man you know we're challenging
[39:37] God you know they didn't know the power
[39:40] of God they didn't know that God was
[39:42] able you know to destroy them by they
[39:44] came anyway they came anyhow to
[39:47] challenge them but God shows them and
[39:49] God told them you know what I have
[39:51] people you know I have people in this
[39:53] age I have people you know though the
[39:55] trials are you going to know that
[39:58] they're hard times you're going to God
[40:00] is able to say that you know what I have
[40:02] one man who can still trust me you know

[40:09] body you know his body was sick you know
[40:11] his children everybody was killed
[40:13] and these brings friends amongst him you
[40:16] know we began to tell him you know why
[40:17] don't you just curse the Lord why don't
[40:19] you just you know denied the Lord and go
[40:21] away and then die easily but then he
[40:24] said when I got old sitting before he
[40:26] said you know what he in this entire
[40:28] city I have one person though you know
[40:31] though you take everything from him
[40:33] don't you take you know now he's my knee
[40:35] do you take is healthy the does he do
[40:37] you take his children from him don't you
[40:40] check everything you know around him
[40:43] surrounding him by the one thing he
[40:45] would never curse me and God was there
[40:47] watching you know that job you know
[40:50] going through destroyers God was there
[40:52] watching job you know how joy was was
[40:55] going to take the challenge because God
[40:57] ever came to God to challenge him he
[41:00] said you know what it's because of this
[41:01] you gave him this and that's why he
[41:04] still serving you you know it's because
[41:05] he gave him a good job that's why he's
[41:07] still serving you it's because you gave
[41:09] him a good wife that's why he's still
[41:11] serving you is because you gave him a
[41:13] good good children that's why he steals
[41:15] area serving you so let me take these
[41:18] people out of his hand let me take these
[41:20] people away and still and see if we
[41:23] still have you know this testimony that
[41:25] I always still serve God you know
[41:28] sometimes when we speak and sometimes
[41:30] when we say things you know we usually
[41:32] say it just by the sake of saying you
[41:34] know we say that you know what you know
[41:36] even though I I'm sick today you know I
[41:38] was staring serve God by the true moment
[41:41] to say this day is one the sickness
[41:43] coming to you you know where the true
[41:45] moment to say you know to say to trust
[41:47] in the Lord is when you have hard times
[41:49] when you have problems in your family
[41:51] when you have you know everything is
[41:53] going wrong that's when we see that you
[41:55] know this man was not joking when he
[41:57] said this and then you know job was
[42:00] there you know going through all these
[42:02] times you know going through a hard
[42:04] times but he never cursed the name of
[42:07] the Lord you know God was there watching
[42:09] him my job knew that at the end of the
[42:12] day you know he's Redeemer was living is
[42:15] redeemer leave and then God came and
[42:18] then God restored everything God gave
[42:21] him the double of everything he had and
[42:23] then we have to know that one thing that
[42:25] that when we read the Bible but we found
[42:27] ourselves you know know we see that when
[42:30] when we have our trials and persecutions
[42:32] when we have you know everything going
[42:35] wrong that in order for us to overcome
[42:38] it we have to have cross inside of us
[42:40] you know if we go to our first John
[42:43] chapter 4 verse 4th 1st John chapter 4
[42:51] verse 4 the Bible says that year of God
[42:59] little children and have overcome them
[43:02] because greater is He that is in you
[43:05] than he that is in the world you know
[43:07] you have overcome this world you have
[43:10] overcome that are everything that is
[43:12] coming to you why because greater is He
[43:15] that isn't there the greater is He that
[43:17] is in you than he that is worth you know
[43:19] we're serving the greater God we're
[43:21] serving you know a God who can stand and
[43:23] there is no sickness there is no heart
[43:25] and there's no trial that can stand
[43:27] against us why because we're serving the
[43:29] greater one and then and then we're we
[43:32] we have to know that you know that there
[43:35] is no testimony without test you know
[43:38] that's why we have to go through tests -
[43:41] for sure that we can have testimony I
[43:43] want to read what what the Prophet says
[43:45] he says that why does he stand by the
[43:53] reason is in Romans
[43:54] chapter 8 verse 13 17 to 18 he said that
[43:59] and if children then heirs heirs of God
[44:02] and joint-heirs were and joint heirs
[44:06] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[44:09] him that we may be also glorified
[44:11] together for our reckon that the
[44:14] sufferings of this present time are not
[44:17] worthy to be compared with the glory
[44:20] which shall be revealed in us unless we
[44:23] suffer with him
[44:24] we cannot reign with him you have to
[44:28] suffer to reign the reason for this is
[44:31] that character simply is never made
[44:34] without suffering character is a victory
[44:38] not a gift
[44:39] a man without character can train
[44:42] because power apart from carrier is
[44:44] satanic but power with character is
[44:47] speak to rule and since he wants us to
[44:50] share even his throne on the same basis
[44:53] that he overcame that he overcame and
[44:56] sat down with his father story I mean
[44:59] his father turn then we have to overcome
[45:01] to sit with him and the little temporary
[45:06] suffering we go through now he's not
[45:08] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[45:11] glory that will be revealed in us when
[45:14] we when he comes Oh
[45:15] what treasure are laid up for those who
[45:18] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[45:21] through much tribulation you know there
[45:24] the prophet of God is explaining why we
[45:26] do have trials what we do have tests he
[45:29] says that he's experienced they are
[45:30] showing that test first comes to form
[45:34] our character because if we want to be
[45:37] very kind of a test come to to form our
[45:42] character and with if we go back to the
[45:44] Bible in Romans chapter 5 verse 3 to
[45:48] verse 5 we read
[45:57] Roman chapter 5 verse 3 to verse 5 the
[46:01] Bible says and not only so but we glory
[46:04] in tribulations also knowing that
[46:06] tribulation worketh patience and
[46:09] patience experience and experience hope
[46:12] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[46:15] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[46:18] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[46:21] now here we're seeing the you know that
[46:24] the Bible is going with the prophets
[46:26] saying that you know when we have tests
[46:28] he works our character you know when we
[46:31] have tips God is showing us to be / - be
[46:33] patient
[46:34] you know well sometimes ago I was going
[46:38] myself through hard times and you know I
[46:40] found myself in this situation where I
[46:41] had to pay bills you know it was I
[46:44] remember it was it was on Tuesday and I
[46:47] had to pay those bills on on side the
[46:49] Saturday of the same week and I found
[46:51] there that you know I had money by the
[46:54] money that I had was not enough to pay
[46:55] and I was mad about that and I had a and
[46:58] I had to to have another reminding you
[47:01] know to competing to pay those bills by
[47:03] the end of the day the week and then I
[47:06] found myself and I started you know
[47:07] thinking as always when we do have
[47:09] trials and yeah when we do have things
[47:12] coming to hospital we first think to
[47:14] find solutions but you know I found it
[47:17] I began to think you know if I asked my
[47:19] dad to give me but some money and and
[47:21] then they took him to me I just asked my
[47:24] dad yesterday and told me that he didn't
[47:26] have money
[47:27] I said no myself that where can I go
[47:29] where would I go and then I and then a
[47:32] voice came to me and say that you know
[47:34] and that the devil without but I believe
[47:36] that was the devil coming to me and say
[47:38] that you know what go to or go to God is
[47:41] sending me to go to God in prayer by go
[47:43] complain to God and it happened that I
[47:45] just preached this message about by do
[47:48] not complain when you try and now hear
[47:51] the devil is telling me you know go to
[47:53] God and go pray and then complain to
[47:55] that complaint and then I and then I
[47:57] didn't understand why I wear that voice
[47:59] scamming and I just opened my mouth and
[48:02] I said thank you Jesus and then I forgot
[48:04] about the situation and then I began to
[48:07] leave and you know to go out I went to
[48:08] work and
[48:09] and I believe it was on Thursday and I
[48:11] see my manager coming and giving me the
[48:13] envelope and saying that you know what
[48:15] this is very decent for my wedding and
[48:17] then by the time and when I received the
[48:19] envelope I didn't open it and I began to
[48:21] think you know what I have to put the
[48:23] good suit that I have on you know cuz
[48:25] it's my managers wedding and I have to
[48:28] you know to show them that I also have
[48:30] certain you know and I can't dress up
[48:32] for sir and then as I began to think
[48:34] about how to how to get there and you
[48:38] know when that that wedding will be and
[48:41] when everything were being and then I um
[48:44] by the end of my shift
[48:46] you know I got in my car and I drove
[48:48] back home and arriving at home and
[48:50] before getting off the car I said well
[48:52] let me first open this envelope and see
[48:54] what what is the schedule and when is
[48:57] the wedding and you know at what time so
[48:59] that I can get there and when I opened
[49:01] but when I opened the envelope brother I
[49:03] saw the exact amount of money that I was
[49:05] missing you know to show you that you
[49:07] know God is there you know to fight our
[49:09] battles to show you that God is there
[49:11] God listened to us God knows what you're
[49:14] going through and he knows how to supply
[49:16] to it you know only if you trust in him
[49:18] there is only one thing if you trust in
[49:21] him God will fight your battles you know
[49:23] it happened that in the Bible but one
[49:25] time you know the other that the
[49:26] children of airlines you know got the to
[49:29] turn over like the Bible compare them
[49:31] try to evil children you know that they
[49:33] came there that Israel was in a battle
[49:36] and fighting and Israel find himself be
[49:39] being defeated and then the distrito
[49:41] availa
[49:42] you know think I thought that you know
[49:43] what we have the ark in the temple that
[49:46] if we can go and check the Ark of God
[49:48] God will come and fight for us you know
[49:50] at that time you know they they thought
[49:52] that God would still fight for them but
[49:55] God didn't fight for them why because
[49:56] their lives were not good you know and
[49:58] they went there and they took the arm
[50:03] they took the ark and then cuz we know
[50:06] that if we read the Bible we see them
[50:07] every time that Israel was going through
[50:10] a bottle when they healthy when they had
[50:12] the ark in their camp you know they were
[50:14] they were always winning and then they
[50:16] throw that that time was still was going
[50:19] to be the same thing but they forgot one
[50:22] that their lives you know didn't permit
[50:24] or didn't Allah God to walk because I
[50:27] choose to work through them because we
[50:29] found out that in the Bible those
[50:31] children were coming to church and you
[50:33] know taking a tree they are taking the
[50:39] lambs that was given for sacrificing but
[50:41] bring them back to home and cook them
[50:44] and and eat with their fathers and
[50:45] everything and I thought that I didn't
[50:47] repent first that's why you know there
[50:49] is it's really important that when we
[50:52] come to church that we may have respect
[50:54] you know that's why it is really
[50:56] important that when we come to church we
[50:58] have we have to respect the presence of
[50:59] God
[51:00] you know we preached on their land last
[51:01] Friday about respect fear in God and we
[51:04] wish driven by by God's grace we we
[51:06] found out that when we come to church
[51:08] and everybody when he comes to church he
[51:10] said his prayers Lord come among us Lord
[51:13] come and dwell among us and when God
[51:15] always answer to his invitations now
[51:19] when we called us to be among us he
[51:21] always there you know when we were
[51:23] seeing the Bible the story of that man
[51:25] who called Jesus cross and say Lord that
[51:29] he sent His Messenger to to go and call
[51:31] Jesus crossing and then Jesus went there
[51:34] and jesus knew that they are arriving to
[51:37] dr. their very arriving to Simon's last
[51:41] house that he will be mistreated but he
[51:44] went anyhow what to show that why that
[51:46] when you call me I will be there but
[51:49] there is a lot of time here many times
[51:51] that we found ourselves when we call God
[51:53] and God is here amongst our by sometimes
[51:55] we put God in the corner and then you
[51:57] say well brother I said what what you
[51:59] mean by putting on the corners you know
[52:01] the way we act in church you know it's
[52:03] putting God in the corner you know
[52:05] sometimes among God's especially if
[52:07] we've gone at least that when we come in
[52:09] we usually come late to church you know
[52:11] if that is not showing respect if we
[52:14] were if we had for example like a
[52:16] meeting with with the great man and now
[52:18] with the president we will find
[52:20] ourselves in church earlier you know to
[52:22] take up spend you know to take the first
[52:24] Freddy to take the first view but what
[52:26] about God who is most powerful than they
[52:29] were the president what about God who is
[52:31] most powerful than any man but we use
[52:34] we neglect God and then we think that
[52:36] God will fight for us but first before
[52:39] God fighting for us we effort to show
[52:41] respect that's why you find in the Bible
[52:43] Joshua when he came in when were when he
[52:46] was everywhere when he he found himself
[52:49] before before the walls and you know
[52:54] every the city was was built up with
[52:57] their walls and he didn't even have any
[52:59] in any way to go through and he found
[53:02] themselves with but with young people
[53:04] who didn't have experience of fire
[53:06] fighting because all the the other ones
[53:09] dead passed away in the desert and then
[53:11] he had to meet the angel and notice the
[53:14] angel told him one thing that take your
[53:16] shoes off because you are in the holy
[53:18] ground to show respect you know when you
[53:21] are in front of God you have to have
[53:22] respect you know when you are in God's
[53:25] presence you know in church you have to
[53:27] have respect in your way of acting in a
[53:29] way of doing things you know you have to
[53:31] show God you know God you are welcome
[53:33] here and when you show God that when you
[53:35] show that God is welcome God is always
[53:37] you know pleasing to Black's and to you
[53:41] know to bless us and then we saw that
[53:43] character had to purpose have to purpose
[53:46] first thing is to form I mean
[53:49] potentially has to purpose first thing
[53:51] is to form a character you know cause we
[53:53] have to recall to went with him when we
[53:56] read in revelation 2 3 verse 21 the
[54:00] Bible says that he that overcometh will
[54:02] be in God's throne you know for the
[54:05] Church of the audition and then we found
[54:07] that before us to be in God's throne for
[54:10] for us to you know to feast with God we
[54:13] have to have a certain character you
[54:15] know because God can never let anyone
[54:17] who doesn't have character
[54:19] you know who doesn't know how to trust
[54:21] God you know him is wrong you know
[54:23] because God doesn't want to see people
[54:26] or God and God doesn't want to see his
[54:28] bride you know being tossed about with
[54:31] you know everything that the words can
[54:33] be the words can can bring to us and
[54:35] that's why you know people he has to to
[54:38] send us a test that's why I had to send
[54:41] us you know our tribulations and trials
[54:43] to form us because God want us to be
[54:46] solid God want us to
[54:48] you know I testimony to know that we're
[54:51] serving it through God you know as a as
[54:54] one day uh I believe was brother Sam
[54:56] preaching and then he saw and he began
[54:59] he went to the Bible and began to say
[55:01] that you know Moses winner when Moses
[55:04] went to the burning bush before Moses
[55:06] carefully experienced with God Moses you
[55:09] know had in his mind was it's only knew
[55:11] they got of his father Moses only knew
[55:14] that the God of Abraham Moses only knew
[55:16] they got of Isaac Moses only knew they
[55:19] got of Jacob but Moses said to a great
[55:21] you came to come here to come and the
[55:23] point where the same God of his father
[55:26] was his God and how that God who had to
[55:30] be his God is to go SDA was to have an
[55:33] experience with that God you know he had
[55:35] to know that you know when I'm going to
[55:37] age it to said that that God's people
[55:39] free I have this experience to show them
[55:42] that you know what I'm serving the I am
[55:44] the God who is with me and he told me
[55:46] you know what go and I would be with you
[55:49] you know and then and then when he came
[55:51] there you know you had that assurance
[55:53] that God was with him
[55:54] that's why when he had trials that's why
[55:57] when things you know cookin didn't work
[55:59] as he as he as he was thinking you know
[56:01] he could still keep the faith why
[56:04] because he knew that he made God and God
[56:06] was with him that's what we find in the
[56:08] Bible that joint was emphasizing that we
[56:11] have to have God inside of us so that we
[56:14] may find our bodies because we're
[56:16] because when we have battle it's not us
[56:18] fighting it's God fighting for us you
[56:20] know when we have battle is not us
[56:22] fighting it's the Holy Spirit cross the
[56:25] word that is fighting for us that why
[56:27] that's why it is so important for us to
[56:30] have the Holy Spirit that's why it is
[56:32] very important for us for us to know God
[56:34] personally that's why it is so important
[56:37] to her for us to have you know that
[56:39] experience when we have those things
[56:42] coming you know we can say that you know
[56:44] what we're serving the true God we're
[56:46] serving the God who reigns we're serving
[56:48] the God who before we had you know we
[56:51] had December I had this but the devil
[56:54] came to me in this way but he set me
[56:57] free and no matter how come the devil
[56:59] can come again you know no matter what
[57:02] suit that ever can put on you know the
[57:04] same God who first fought for me you
[57:07] know he will come and he will come and
[57:09] fight me of my my battles and then the
[57:11] Prophet said that sometimes the cloudy
[57:13] skies are not signs of God disapproval
[57:16] you know sometimes when we go through
[57:18] hard times we think that God is not with
[57:20] us you know sometimes when we go when
[57:23] you have sickness you have cancer you
[57:24] have you know we're about hard time in
[57:27] your family sometimes you know as human
[57:30] we think that God is not with us that
[57:32] sometimes you know God has rejected us
[57:33] sometimes you know you know but we
[57:35] cannot even go to God's praises
[57:38] sometimes you know that we we now worth
[57:40] anything that you know I rather died and
[57:43] then leave by some time God just want us
[57:46] to be closer to him you know because
[57:48] they just want us to be closer to him
[57:50] remember that the story that a prophet
[57:53] said about the shepherd who had a who
[57:55] had a lamb and who had a little sheep
[57:58] you know that lamb what was going away
[58:00] from him that lamb was not being next to
[58:03] the Shepherd by the shepherd wanted that
[58:06] lamb to be closer to him and what the
[58:08] Shepherd had to do was to break that
[58:10] land leg you know to show him that you
[58:13] know what about breaking your leg I
[58:15] would take care of you you know somebody
[58:17] that I take myself you know I put myself
[58:19] in the shoes of that lamb you know what
[58:21] I would say I would say that truly this
[58:23] shepherd doesn't love me because if he
[58:25] loved me he couldn't break my lamb
[58:27] I had my leg if you loved me you
[58:29] couldn't want me to suffer because
[58:32] breaking somebody's leg you know it's a
[58:35] pain you know you're going to you know
[58:37] you can't walk it and you can do the
[58:39] activities as you can you know you can't
[58:41] play playing in sports and you know you
[58:43] can't walk you can't go to school and
[58:45] you can do nothing you know you will be
[58:46] there and they're laying and waiting for
[58:48] people to take care of you you know if I
[58:50] put myself enough in that then they left
[58:52] shoes and I would say that you know that
[58:54] the shepherd doesn't love me but that
[58:56] wasn't what I was in the heart of the
[58:58] Shepherd the Shepherd wanted only to
[59:01] express his love to the lamb showing him
[59:04] that you know what when you will be
[59:05] closer to me you know I will show you I
[59:08] would take you in my hands you know
[59:10] that's why we have to sometimes cloudy
[59:12] skies that's why we have sometimes you
[59:14] know thieves
[59:15] working that's why we have sometimes at
[59:17] work in school and you know everywhere
[59:19] our homes when we find ourselves you
[59:22] know that things are not working and
[59:24] then we sometimes think that God is not
[59:26] with us sometimes we think that you know
[59:28] what you know I you know I rather die
[59:31] and instead of say I'm suffering like
[59:33] this but God just wanted to be closer to
[59:36] him
[59:36] you know God just wonder because when we
[59:39] have trials that bring us to pray that
[59:41] will bring you to pray that will bring
[59:43] you you know to have this closer
[59:45] relationship with God that will bring
[59:47] you you know to go ask for help and I
[59:50] want to read what the Prophet said the
[59:52] prophecy that the cloudy skies and
[59:53] storms of life are not signs of God
[59:55] disapproval neither are the bright skies
[59:58] and steel water signs of his love and
[1:00:00] approval his approval of any of us is
[1:00:03] the earth is only in the beloved his log
[1:00:08] is elective which he had for us his love
[1:00:12] is elective which he had for us before
[1:00:14] the foundation of the world there are
[1:00:18] many prophet asked does he love us and
[1:00:20] then he said yes so he said yes he does
[1:00:23] but how shall we know he said that we
[1:00:27] shall know because he said so we shall
[1:00:31] know that God loves us why because he
[1:00:33] said so and then and then beber beber
[1:00:37] that sometimes you know the devil can
[1:00:39] ask you because sometimes we go through
[1:00:41] you know by my baby troubles and you
[1:00:43] know your mind and you you ask yourself
[1:00:45] questions you know that's really God
[1:00:47] love me or do I really have the Holy
[1:00:51] Spirit or you know why am I going
[1:00:53] through this trials and when they the
[1:00:56] prophets say that you know what you know
[1:00:58] God love you because he said so
[1:01:01] you know he gave his son for you you
[1:01:04] know he let his son died on the cross
[1:01:06] suffer the pain that nobody can do that
[1:01:09] nobody can bear you know why for your
[1:01:11] sake so that you may believe in him and
[1:01:14] by believing in him is giving you
[1:01:15] eternal life and I bet and I keep on the
[1:01:18] prophecy that he because he said so and
[1:01:21] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:01:24] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:01:28] spirit
[1:01:29] facing us as sons and how shall I prove
[1:01:32] my love to him he said that by believing
[1:01:35] what he said and by conducting myself
[1:01:39] with joy a means of by connecting myself
[1:01:43] with joy amidst the trial that he and
[1:01:47] his wisdom allows to come to pass
[1:01:51] you know how can I show to God that I
[1:01:54] love him he said that you know by
[1:01:56] believing what God says there is many
[1:01:59] promise in the world that that is for us
[1:02:02] that are for us you know when you
[1:02:04] believe those promises you know you're
[1:02:06] showing God that you love him and then
[1:02:09] he said what by the second thing is by
[1:02:11] conducting myself through trials that he
[1:02:13] allows himself you know to come to us
[1:02:16] because if you buy we go back to the
[1:02:18] story of job we found out that before
[1:02:21] the devil went to job he had first to
[1:02:24] come by God you know before the devil
[1:02:26] come to your life before the devil do
[1:02:29] anything to you he has first to go by
[1:02:32] God he had first to to get his
[1:02:34] permission by God you know God had first
[1:02:38] you know God had first to tell him that
[1:02:40] you know what I give you now go go ahead
[1:02:42] but there's one thing that God always
[1:02:44] tell him do not touch his life why
[1:02:47] because God wants you to stand as a
[1:02:49] testimony you know because there's Trier
[1:02:52] than the message trials the prophet he's
[1:02:54] saying that you know better destroyers
[1:02:56] the devil he's attacking God the devil
[1:02:58] he's accusing God you know saying that
[1:03:00] God cannot heal saying that God we will
[1:03:02] forsake his children saying that God you
[1:03:04] know it doesn't love us by the prophets
[1:03:07] say that God is looking for the man for
[1:03:08] the person for the believers who can
[1:03:11] stand against the trial who can stand
[1:03:13] and show God to the devil that you know
[1:03:15] what God loved us that God healed me
[1:03:18] that I had decent and I am a weakness
[1:03:21] that here is God he said that there is
[1:03:23] the devil and I was attacking that ever
[1:03:25] now is bringing people is bringing his
[1:03:27] weakness to show to prove that God is
[1:03:31] that the promise of God our wrongs but
[1:03:33] God now also is looking for you know God
[1:03:35] forgot in the Bible took job and God
[1:03:38] took Abraham and the you know God to
[1:03:42] we've got to Peter and God took
[1:03:44] everybody but that's not enough God is
[1:03:46] still looking in this age you know who
[1:03:49] can stand and who can stand and give the
[1:03:51] testimony that you know God's promises
[1:03:53] are true who can stand and give their
[1:03:55] testimony that you know though the two
[1:03:58] daughters that the cloud disguise the
[1:04:01] door every trials and everything I can
[1:04:04] still keep the faith who can stand and
[1:04:06] say that to the devil you know what you
[1:04:09] know I serve it through God
[1:04:10] now he delivered me that one day I was
[1:04:13] bound and seen by he came to me he set
[1:04:16] me free that one day I was bound and
[1:04:18] seen he came to me and he gave me the
[1:04:20] Holy Spirit when the devil is coming a
[1:04:22] decision instead of trying to say that
[1:04:24] God cannot feel the people with the Holy
[1:04:26] Spirit when the devil is coming in this
[1:04:28] edge and trying to say that God cannot
[1:04:29] save people my god is turning that you
[1:04:32] know God God is looking for people you
[1:04:34] know for bride for Christian who can
[1:04:36] stand up and say you know what God
[1:04:38] filled me with the Holy Spirit I
[1:04:40] remember who I was I remember what I was
[1:04:43] doing before I remember you know where I
[1:04:45] was but now I can say I'm not the same
[1:04:48] person now I can say that I've been set
[1:04:50] free now I can say that you know I've
[1:04:52] been delivered and now I can say that
[1:04:54] I'm filled and now I can say that God is
[1:04:56] with me and when you feel that's when
[1:04:59] God come and fight for you and you say
[1:05:02] about well brother I see but but we see
[1:05:04] in the world you know that those people
[1:05:06] also have trials about how did they
[1:05:08] overcome when they don't have trial
[1:05:10] whether I don't have gotten inside of
[1:05:12] him you know that was the same question
[1:05:14] that I bear the children of Israel was
[1:05:16] asking themselves they say about those
[1:05:18] people that more abided that they are
[1:05:20] Syrian and those people don't have God
[1:05:22] but how when they have battles they
[1:05:24] overcome and then God is only required
[1:05:27] us to have him for her for him to
[1:05:29] overcome you know why because you differ
[1:05:31] from these people you know the way God
[1:05:33] is trading with you you know it's
[1:05:35] different from the way God is treating
[1:05:36] but you know to our but we've got his
[1:05:39] training with the pagan and with the
[1:05:40] world you know you have to have God so
[1:05:42] that you may overcome because you are
[1:05:44] his children you'll remember the Bible
[1:05:46] said that dial gently only got your
[1:05:48] skies only those he loved you know is
[1:05:51] that to show you that God loves you
[1:05:54] that's what God had to make sure that
[1:05:56] you have him you know because he said
[1:05:58] that if you have him you know you are
[1:06:00] more than conquerors because that's why
[1:06:02] the Bible said that we have been more
[1:06:04] than conquerors because we have God
[1:06:06] inside of us
[1:06:07] you know the Bible you know that's why
[1:06:09] and I love when by when brother Branham
[1:06:12] you know preached about how can I
[1:06:13] overcome you know he preached about this
[1:06:15] word how can I overcome but he didn't
[1:06:18] preach about what can I overcome you
[1:06:20] know because he knew that a godly that
[1:06:22] the devil can change for he knew that
[1:06:24] you know the same trials and endure the
[1:06:26] same tribulation that he had you know
[1:06:28] the children I that the trials Audia
[1:06:30] that we know the things that was in his
[1:06:32] time when he was living will not be the
[1:06:35] same you know with us today we know as
[1:06:37] young people or as a young man I know
[1:06:40] that you know you know that now it's
[1:06:42] harder you know to leave you you know
[1:06:44] we're in this world but but there is one
[1:06:47] thing that you show that sound to
[1:06:49] overcome you know because they knew that
[1:06:51] the devil will change form by showing us
[1:06:53] how to overcome and say that you know
[1:06:55] for us to overcome we have to have cross
[1:06:57] inside of us that's the key
[1:06:59] having Christ inside of us you know
[1:07:01] that's the key you know having having
[1:07:03] the Holy Spirit inside of us that's
[1:07:05] where we were we were offer comes and
[1:07:08] the prophet talking about sickness the
[1:07:10] prophet says and I don't want you to get
[1:07:12] the impression that me or Oral Roberts
[1:07:15] or somebody else is the only person
[1:07:18] that's all dead that is ordained to do
[1:07:20] this he said that every minister is or
[1:07:23] them to do it every believer he said
[1:07:26] about whether he's a minister or not is
[1:07:29] all dead to do it every person that
[1:07:32] believes as right as a right to lay
[1:07:35] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:07:37] I don't say your posture or any will be
[1:07:41] taking the gift of discernment that they
[1:07:44] don't have to do that that's not their
[1:07:46] calling that's not their calling to do
[1:07:50] that that's their that does to be one in
[1:07:53] an age but we found out that you are
[1:07:55] called as believer
[1:07:57] you know these signs shall follow them I
[1:08:00] don't point out any person them that
[1:08:03] believe you know you believe it with all
[1:08:06] your heart
[1:08:07] you know and then when you believe these
[1:08:09] things and these signs will follow you
[1:08:12] and I remember one day I owe me money my
[1:08:14] home where I'll even you know about
[1:08:17] might one day buzzer I believe it was
[1:08:19] during the summer even become even
[1:08:21] before I start preaching and then I and
[1:08:24] then one day I woke up early in the
[1:08:26] morning and my mother was not feeling
[1:08:28] good and then he called me and he said I
[1:08:30] said would you do this recipe for me and
[1:08:33] so that made drinking so that I feel
[1:08:34] well you know I gave her and I do
[1:08:36] everything that I taught her and she
[1:08:38] told me and I gave her and that recipe
[1:08:41] that that you that she asked me to do
[1:08:43] you know made things worse and then
[1:08:46] brother least for I know but many of you
[1:08:48] know him and and some but you know you
[1:08:50] just woke up her in the morning and went
[1:08:52] up with ya in her bedroom and you know
[1:08:54] and she found that he found our mother
[1:08:56] you know you know laying there and
[1:08:58] feeling she was not feeling good you
[1:09:00] know she was everywhere you know
[1:09:02] churning and being here and there and
[1:09:04] then he called me and say I said come
[1:09:06] here look I look out I look out my mom
[1:09:08] is feeling and then he said you know why
[1:09:10] let's lay our hands on him let's say hey
[1:09:12] let's pray for her and we said we were
[1:09:15] we were there when we prayed and we
[1:09:16] asked God to heal her and after somehow
[1:09:19] were to go be like that she was right
[1:09:21] she was made right she was healed and
[1:09:23] she was able to go to work why because
[1:09:25] we show that you know you know we have
[1:09:28] power sometimes we just don't recognize
[1:09:30] our position as Christ best bride
[1:09:33] sometimes we just don't recognize our
[1:09:35] position as Christian the order that the
[1:09:37] Bible says that the old one when they
[1:09:39] the Holy Spirit will come with power you
[1:09:42] know where the Holy Spirit will come
[1:09:43] with power and that power is not just
[1:09:46] something or that part we cannot just
[1:09:48] put that power in a box saying that you
[1:09:50] know what I am NOT able to do this or
[1:09:53] I'm not able to this thing or this thing
[1:09:55] is now on my level
[1:09:56] you know everything if you believe if
[1:09:58] you just know your position you don't
[1:10:00] want you will fight that battle and you
[1:10:03] will really overcome the only because if
[1:10:05] you know your position you know what I
[1:10:07] love about the children of Israel they
[1:10:09] knew what that was they know who there
[1:10:11] was and they knew that God that were
[1:10:14] serving they lose that a God who said
[1:10:16] them free you know Papa when there was
[1:10:18] we fair will the greatest Armond
[1:10:21] world in that in their time but there
[1:10:23] could go said freeze you know that was
[1:10:26] set free you know but they they knew who
[1:10:28] their was why because they had
[1:10:30] experience that they experienced God
[1:10:32] that's why it is so important to have
[1:10:34] the experience with God because
[1:10:36] sometimes the devil will come to you not
[1:10:38] sometime by the devil will come to you
[1:10:40] try to show you that God is not able to
[1:10:43] do it but you know what one thing it
[1:10:45] also it is important to what to have
[1:10:47] experience to experience God you know
[1:10:49] even the Prophet himself you know yeah
[1:10:51] he said that that sometimes when you
[1:10:54] pray for the sick people you know he was
[1:10:56] praying for that morning that that that
[1:10:58] boy was was blinded and he said that
[1:11:01] usually when he pray for the sick people
[1:11:03] and if they don't they're not healed at
[1:11:05] the pleasure i sympathy always tells
[1:11:08] them you know what go and believe you
[1:11:10] will be here but at that time it was
[1:11:12] different
[1:11:12] you know that boy needed to see and then
[1:11:15] with the Prophet prayed for his first
[1:11:17] diamond that did that but was not healed
[1:11:19] he pray for the second time the boy was
[1:11:21] not still here and they bet the devil
[1:11:23] now came to him starting you know to
[1:11:25] show him that you know what that this
[1:11:27] boy will not be here just let him going
[1:11:29] if he has faith you know and you will be
[1:11:32] healed and then the portrait not now
[1:11:34] began now to think about his experience
[1:11:36] that he had with God now the Prophet I
[1:11:38] began to think about you know to show
[1:11:40] that therefore how the same God it was
[1:11:43] praying you know works before and then
[1:11:45] when he began to think about those
[1:11:47] things when he began to think about
[1:11:49] those things that build up his faith and
[1:11:51] then they prayed again for the last time
[1:11:53] for that boy and I bought a head and
[1:11:55] that one was able to see you know why
[1:11:57] because he knew who he was why he knew
[1:12:00] why who God was to him why he knew you
[1:12:04] know what God did with them before you
[1:12:06] know that's why it is very important to
[1:12:07] know God to have a personal relationship
[1:12:09] with God that's why it is very important
[1:12:11] to know who you are that you know that
[1:12:13] when I speak that God will always be
[1:12:16] there when I speak when I say something
[1:12:18] God will always be there behind me and
[1:12:20] then to approve everything why because
[1:12:23] he said that these signs will follow
[1:12:25] them that believe if you just believe
[1:12:27] then we follow you they prophets say
[1:12:30] that God didn't the God didn't name
[1:12:32] people by saying this it didn't say that
[1:12:35] these signs we only follow ministers or
[1:12:37] pastors all the prophets all great men
[1:12:40] no he said that this time we follow
[1:12:42] every believers it doesn't matter how
[1:12:45] old you are it doesn't matter you know
[1:12:47] how you are
[1:12:48] he said that this time we follow you if
[1:12:50] you only believe and then we saw that
[1:12:52] the brigade a prophecy that God gave us
[1:12:54] the most powerful weapon in the world
[1:12:56] you know which is prayer he said that
[1:12:59] when we pray even he said the weakest
[1:13:01] Christian when it is on his knees pray
[1:13:03] the entire hell is trembling you know
[1:13:06] the devil had to know that you know
[1:13:08] something wrong is about to happen why
[1:13:11] because you know that when we pray and a
[1:13:13] prophet of God said that when we come to
[1:13:15] God in the name of Jesus cross Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ takes our place you know he gets
[1:13:20] into action and then it takes our place
[1:13:22] now it's God himself pray and when God
[1:13:25] Himself Jesus Christ himself is pray you
[1:13:28] know he that that thing has to happen
[1:13:29] you know we we have to come and pray
[1:13:31] that's why it is also important you know
[1:13:34] to have our personal time of Prayer
[1:13:36] you know as Christians you know we have
[1:13:38] battles we have trials but we have also
[1:13:41] to have our present time of praise you
[1:13:43] know to quieten ourselves and let God
[1:13:45] speak to us you know to quiet our self
[1:13:48] or sometimes we do too much talking but
[1:13:50] we but there's a time where we have to
[1:13:51] go there you know in that room you know
[1:13:54] where we close every doors and we will
[1:13:57] cross every doors and everything every
[1:13:59] windows and everything we just said
[1:14:01] there Lord speak to me and he will speak
[1:14:04] to you Lord speak to me it was speak to
[1:14:06] you if he doesn't speak to you begin to
[1:14:08] worship him if he doesn't speak to you
[1:14:10] you know begin to say to to speak to him
[1:14:12] some sweet words you know don't first
[1:14:14] start by asking him just begin to
[1:14:17] worship him show him how good he is to
[1:14:19] you you know show him how good he has
[1:14:21] been to you show you how to show him how
[1:14:23] he set you free when I began began not
[1:14:26] to remind him what is done for you and
[1:14:28] then all of a sudden you will find
[1:14:30] yourself you know questions that you
[1:14:32] have you know questions that you had you
[1:14:34] find solution you know things at your
[1:14:36] hand you know you will find yourself you
[1:14:38] know God is speaking to me I remember
[1:14:40] one time I I think couple of months ago
[1:14:43] I was there I had in my mind you know a
[1:14:45] question about a Bible verse and I and I
[1:14:48] was
[1:14:48] myself why these things that to happen I
[1:14:50] wanted to know that the details of
[1:14:53] everything that had to happen but I
[1:14:55] didn't know Who am I going to go to you
[1:14:57] know I being then I came in I was so
[1:14:59] lazy to go and study their words and you
[1:15:02] know I said well let me ask you let me
[1:15:04] ask brother Brooks and I texted brother
[1:15:06] Brooks and I asked him and brother Bruce
[1:15:07] Garrett said but you know brother I have
[1:15:09] to study
[1:15:10] and I said bye well I need this answer
[1:15:12] right now and I said well they let me
[1:15:14] test again brother Jesse Smith and he
[1:15:16] was said yes he said the same thing and
[1:15:18] I said well so now what why do why do I
[1:15:21] have to do and I said there is not any
[1:15:23] place to go to I have to go to God and I
[1:15:25] went to my room and I start praying and
[1:15:27] then I heard the voice of God telling me
[1:15:29] you know what you have to go look at the
[1:15:31] sixth seal when I find myself and I said
[1:15:33] why am I going to go look at the sixth
[1:15:35] year you know something that is not even
[1:15:37] related to him and when I was there
[1:15:39] listening to the Prophet and by the end
[1:15:41] of the service you know I found the
[1:15:43] answer of my prayer I found the answer
[1:15:45] of the question that I had you know to
[1:15:47] show you what that when we go to God and
[1:15:49] pray you know God is there to listen to
[1:15:51] us God is there God God has his ears
[1:15:54] open you know that's the difference
[1:15:56] between idols and God you know idols and
[1:15:59] ears but they cannot listen you know
[1:16:01] idols have mouths but they cannot speak
[1:16:04] others have hands but I cannot touch I
[1:16:06] don't have F feet but I cannot walk but
[1:16:09] we're serving a god but we he has here's
[1:16:11] who can hear you know he has mouths he
[1:16:14] can he can speak you know you can answer
[1:16:16] to your questions you know no matter
[1:16:18] what you have you know no matter what
[1:16:20] you know what the question is no matter

[1:16:30] you need you know that God would give
[1:16:33] you the answer what what you need and it
[1:16:35] will show you everything and then I I
[1:16:37] want to read the Bible
[1:16:42] the Bible says that you know God's
[1:16:45] strength he's made perfect
[1:16:47] when we are weak then let's go to second
[1:16:51] Corinthians chapter or chapter 12 verse
[1:16:54] 4 verse 9
[1:16:59] second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9
[1:17:18] the Bible says that he said unto me my
[1:17:22] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:17:25] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:17:30] most godly therefore without rather
[1:17:33] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:17:36] of Christ may rest upon me you know
[1:17:39] sometimes we feel ourselves like we are
[1:17:41] about to give up you know sometimes we
[1:17:44] feel ourselves in the solution where we
[1:17:46] are about to give up
[1:17:47] you know you feel weak and you feel that
[1:17:49] you know what you know I'm giving up and
[1:17:52] but I want just to remind you that
[1:17:54] that's when God strength gum you know
[1:17:57] his strength is made perfect when we
[1:17:59] weak when you find when we found
[1:18:01] ourselves not able to do it when we
[1:18:04] found ourselves not able to overcome
[1:18:06] that's when God came well that's when
[1:18:09] God comes
[1:18:09] you know cause God doesn't want you you
[1:18:12] know to think that you made it by
[1:18:14] yourself God doesn't want you to think
[1:18:16] that you know because of you that's why
[1:18:19] you passed these days that's why God
[1:18:21] with Gideon God had to you know God had
[1:18:24] to wait to tell Gideon you know what
[1:18:25] bring all those soldiers you know into
[1:18:28] tests you know but there are too many
[1:18:31] you know you have too many of them but
[1:18:33] you know God wanted to show Gideon that
[1:18:35] with feel where I lie with a few
[1:18:37] soldiers with only 300 soldiers you know
[1:18:41] he will overcome you know we wanted to
[1:18:43] show Gideon not to trust on your
[1:18:45] abilities now to trust on your strength
[1:18:48] now to trust them
[1:18:49] you know on every anything else by
[1:18:51] trusting me you know when you weak you
[1:18:54] know when you were when you're about to
[1:18:56] give up when you think that you know
[1:18:57] everything is turning against me and and
[1:19:00] I'm and I'm looking for solutions and I
[1:19:03] cannot find you know that's when God's
[1:19:05] true that God's strength comes you know
[1:19:07] remember Jacob when he was there you
[1:19:09] know he first flee from her from his
[1:19:11] brother and they and his way back and
[1:19:13] you know he saw someone coming to him
[1:19:16] and say you know what your brother is
[1:19:17] coming with my demons you know against
[1:19:19] you trying to attack you and Jack o find
[1:19:22] himself you know with his children and
[1:19:23] his family and he found himself weak and
[1:19:27] as every man you know he tried to you
[1:19:29] know to find solutions and he said you
[1:19:31] know
[1:19:32] I will divide my groups into three go to
[1:19:34] groups and those go first and if it
[1:19:37] kills you maybe when I would come it
[1:19:39] will have mercy on me
[1:19:40] but Jacob find himself that everything
[1:19:42] that was trying to do we're not we're
[1:19:44] not work but you had to buy you remember
[1:19:46] you thought about one thing
[1:19:48] I have a god that I can run to you know
[1:19:50] now I'm weak I'm about to give up now my
[1:19:53] brother is coming against me to to
[1:19:54] attempt to you know my now my brother's
[1:19:56] kami against me to fight against me and
[1:19:58] I have no right and I cannot fight again
[1:20:00] I cannot fight back you know I I don't
[1:20:02] have soldiers and I don't have the army
[1:20:05] as he do as he does now where am I going
[1:20:07] to go you know you thought about God and
[1:20:10] when he went to God God gave him victory
[1:20:12] that was able to change the heart of his
[1:20:15] brother you know his brother was coming
[1:20:17] with a you know where we fade you know
[1:20:19] where his brother was guy who was I was
[1:20:21] coming you know well you know with the
[1:20:23] idea to kill him but when his brother
[1:20:25] well when when God's changed his heart
[1:20:27] of the heart of his brother you know God
[1:20:29] put love and his brother and when he
[1:20:31] came there instead of killing him you
[1:20:34] know he kissed him
[1:20:35] you know when Jacob finally you know
[1:20:37] found himself in the situation I'm
[1:20:39] giving up you know he found himself that
[1:20:41] he didn't have strength you know and
[1:20:43] then he thought about God and yourself
[1:20:45] sometime maybe you going through a trial
[1:20:47] where maybe you're going through
[1:20:48] something something that is so hard and
[1:20:51] you find yourself you don't have
[1:20:52] strength you know you want to give up
[1:20:54] you're about to give up but you know
[1:20:56] still have that faith you know still
[1:20:59] have the faith God will God will be
[1:21:02] there because he said that his strength
[1:21:04] is made perfect in our weakness
[1:21:06] it's when we weak that's when it comes
[1:21:08] when we weak that that's one God comes
[1:21:11] and in closing I want to read the above
[1:21:15] this book of the prophet but about pizza
[1:21:20] SDE go stairs to her nest the pay page
[1:21:25] five the Prophet says that if we go only
[1:21:31] take the wings of the Bible God's
[1:21:34] written word and have as much confidence
[1:21:37] in the Word of God by the Holy Spirit if
[1:21:41] if we could only have as much confidence
[1:21:44] as the
[1:21:45] eagle did in his wings you know he knew
[1:21:48] that he could make one jump and above
[1:21:51] and be above that timber and I could not
[1:21:55] and I could never have to shot him I
[1:21:57] watched him you know and after a while
[1:22:00] he got he got tired and he made just one
[1:22:03] big jump and flapped his wings about
[1:22:06] twice and and you know what you know
[1:22:09] what you know what he did he did not
[1:22:11] flop again he just knew how to set his
[1:22:15] wings and he held his wings out and when
[1:22:19] the wind came in and when the wind came
[1:22:24] in he and then he lifted air and then
[1:22:27] the wind are lifted in far away and he
[1:22:30] lifted them up he lifted his wings up
[1:22:32] and I stood and watched him until he
[1:22:35] began just until he began he became just
[1:22:39] a little speck and under the page six
[1:22:42] that the Prophet said god help us to
[1:22:46] take the wings out of the ego take every
[1:22:50] divine promise God has given God has
[1:22:52] given us in the Bible that is in the
[1:22:56] reason alright that is the reason
[1:22:58] friends you are not living in bondage it
[1:23:02] is because the he said that that isn't
[1:23:05] the reason because you're not living a
[1:23:08] bondage it is because you set your wings
[1:23:11] in the promise of God and by faith the
[1:23:14] whole and by faith the Holy Ghost lifted
[1:23:17] you up he said that the ego history
[1:23:21] Harper nest and if there is anyone who
[1:23:24] would dare set his wing in God's promise
[1:23:28] in his world God would take you from the
[1:23:31] it from this miserable unrighteous
[1:23:34] ungodly selfish life that you are living
[1:23:37] and make you free and happy to live
[1:23:40] above sin and live in best for
[1:23:43] atmospherics
[1:23:44] that the world knows nothing about and
[1:23:47] then he say Amen he said that if we can
[1:23:49] only set your wings in the winds of
[1:23:52] faith if you can only set your wings in
[1:23:56] God's promises you know God gave
[1:23:58] a lot of promises he said he will be
[1:24:01] your healer he said that you know don't
[1:24:04] take third of tomorrow you know if we
[1:24:06] can feed that the little bird what about
[1:24:09] you you know God gave promises in the
[1:24:11] Bible you know about everything and he
[1:24:14] also gave promises to overcomers if you
[1:24:17] read the two Reata to that a church
[1:24:19] chapter 2 and chapter 3 of the Bible you
[1:24:21] will see that at the end of every age
[1:24:23] God gave the promises of overcoming for
[1:24:26] over comers you know he died overcoming
[1:24:28] I would do this he that overcometh I
[1:24:30] would do this you know why don't you
[1:24:32] just go into the fight it's not you
[1:24:35] fighting it's God fighting for you so
[1:24:37] stop running away from it you know stop
[1:24:40] running away from the devil because when
[1:24:42] you run away from the devil he gets
[1:24:44] bigger when you run away from him he's
[1:24:46] getting bigger and bigger you know you
[1:24:48] have to stand against him you know and
[1:24:50] showing him you know what as David even
[1:24:53] though I'm a little at this dance there
[1:24:55] even though I'm young I can still fight
[1:24:57] Goliath
[1:24:58] you know Goliath cannot stand against my
[1:25:01] god because I know who I'm serving if
[1:25:04] brother you can come and play or set
[1:25:06] your wings in the butt stretch over your
[1:25:08] your wings in the the winds of faith did
[1:25:10] you know that song all right let's stand
[1:25:14] it's all right you know if we can only
[1:25:17] set our wings in the winds of faith the
[1:25:20] song says that there are two roads that
[1:25:22] you may take one bus I give Justin any
[1:25:27] songs he said that there are two roles
[1:25:29] that you can take one by side one by
[1:25:33] faith by telling you to take the Word of
[1:25:36] God or we already say that you take the
[1:25:39] Word of God or what you see what you
[1:25:42] believe is what will be and then we said
[1:25:46] that set your wings to the winds of
[1:25:48] faith you can fly in the higher place do
[1:25:52] not struggle it's by grace set your
[1:25:55] wings to the winds of faith you say that

[1:26:15] depth things that that you think is too
[1:26:17] high it will move or you will fly he
[1:26:20] said that was the ego in the sky he does
[1:26:23] not struggle and it does not strive for
[1:26:26] because the power that makes him rise
[1:26:29] he's already in the sky you know if you
