[0:19] amen we thank God for being here tonight
[0:23] and
[0:24] uh we appreciate the beautiful weather
[0:28] that God has given us
[0:30] I am grateful to be alive in
[0:34] Christ uh we we stand and have a word of
[0:40] prayer Our dear heavenly father God we
[0:43] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[0:44] Lord we thank you for being so good to
[0:46] us Lord we thank you Father unworthy
[0:50] creatures we are of ourselves but thank
[0:53] God for your dear son in the blood of
[0:55] Jesus Christ that has been shed for us
[0:58] and has become a perpetu ation for our
[1:00] sins Lord we pray right now that you
[1:03] bless this little bible study anoint the
[1:06] word give us wisdom but most of all give
[1:08] us a revelation more revelation of
[1:11] yourself and fellowship with you we ask
[1:15] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:17] pray
[1:18] amen amen we'll be coming
[1:22] from um we'll be dealing with with
[1:26] um the excuse me the scripture
[1:30] of of of uh first
[1:33] John and um we will be incorporating
[1:36] some other things as we go down the line
[1:39] but we'll start
[1:41] reading um first John the first chapter
[1:46] beginning at the fifth
[1:49] verse and U most of us uh pretty much
[1:53] know this particular scriptures or these
[1:54] scriptures by
[1:56] heart um John is a a a beautiful
[2:01] character and
[2:03] um we appreciate
[2:05] everything that the Lord inspired him to
[2:09] write you you and I must understand that
[2:12] by the grace of God John was a one of
[2:15] those disciples that was very close to
[2:18] Jesus and uh he was his brother as well
[2:21] so he saw things that I think
[2:25] some took a time to see but I I believe
[2:30] John saw uh he was kind of ahead of
[2:33] everybody in that uh he had had great
[2:36] great experiences with with the almighty
[2:39] god um he was one that I believe was uh
[2:45] time
[2:46] traveled so anyway we know that's real
[2:49] but let us read this um beginning at the
[2:52] fifth verse of First
[2:54] John uh first
[2:57] chapter this is the message we have have
[3:00] heard from him and declared to you God
[3:05] is
[3:06] light and there is absolutely no
[3:09] darkness in
[3:11] him if we say we have fellowship with
[3:14] him and yet we walk in
[3:17] darkness we are lying and we are
[3:22] not practicing the truth now I'm going
[3:25] to this is kind of another revise but
[3:27] anyway you'll get it if we walk in the
[3:30] light as he is in the light we have
[3:32] Fellowship one with another and the
[3:35] blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from
[3:39] all
[3:40] sin if we say we have no sin we deceive
[3:46] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[3:49] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[3:52] righteous to forgive us of our sins and
[3:54] that cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[3:57] if we say we have not sinned we make him
[4:00] a liar and his word is not in US amen so
[4:05] I'll read it from the King James
[4:08] version this then is the message we have
[4:11] heard of him and declare unto you that
[4:14] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[4:18] if we say that we have fellowship with
[4:21] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[4:24] not the truth but if we walk in the
[4:27] light as he is in the light we we have
[4:30] Fellowship one with another and the
[4:32] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[4:34] us from all sins if we say that we have
[4:39] no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[4:42] truth is not in us if we confess our
[4:46] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[4:49] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[4:52] all
[4:53] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[4:55] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[4:59] word is not in us let's just stop there
[5:02] father we just thank you for the reading
[5:04] of your word we pray father God that you
[5:07] will break the bread of life to us in
[5:10] this hour and we ask it in Jesus name
[5:12] with Thanksgiving amen you may be
[5:17] seated appreciate our brother Matthew uh
[5:21] being with us by the grace of God I I
[5:24] love the scripture I love it all but
[5:26] when I'm
[5:30] when we think about God and we went over
[5:32] that a little bit last time we we
[5:34] studied the first part of of uh the
[5:38] scripture we understand that God is
[5:41] light now when we speak of light we're
[5:44] speaking of Revelation amen okay because
[5:47] when you're in darkness you can't see
[5:49] anything and of course you know just
[5:52] last uh on Wednesday we we worked with
[5:56] you know uh gross Darkness covering the
[5:58] people and and all of these things I
[6:01] believe that when John was writing uh
[6:04] these uh letters or messages by the
[6:07] inspiration of the Holy Ghost God was
[6:10] really uh I take it personally every
[6:13] scripture to me is alive it's not
[6:16] something old and then I got to apply it
[6:19] to me no no no it's fresh it's alive
[6:22] it's for today tomorrow and if there be
[6:25] another day after tomorrow that
[6:27] scripture still lives
[6:29] uh everybody don't can't see God I mean
[6:33] they don't understand God matter of fact
[6:37] you know the Bible said the light came
[6:39] and the and the Darkness comprehended it
[6:42] not meaning that they couldn't
[6:44] understand it they couldn't see it um
[6:47] they couldn't grab a hold of it and but
[6:50] there are those who have been ordained
[6:52] to see the light now as we as we go with
[6:56] this we understand that the only way
[6:58] that you can Tru fellowship with God is
[7:01] that you got to move like the sun you
[7:03] move with the light because the light
[7:07] doesn't
[7:09] change as it move like in the morning
[7:11] and it moves and there's another day
[7:13] that's morning it moves and as it moves
[7:17] or you say the Earth rotate however you
[7:19] look at it light is always there to
[7:22] reveal for you to see something that you
[7:25] could not see when you were in darkness
[7:29] and that's how it is with God if like I
[7:31] said you know in in the day of of of of
[7:35] of Wesley uh they saw their light you
[7:39] know in the day of Luther they saw that
[7:42] was their light but it didn't stay there
[7:45] that revelation of God began to move
[7:47] forward and everybody if you were in
[7:50] Luther age you had to transition into
[7:53] wesle age and the Wesleyan had to
[7:55] transition into Pentecostal age and the
[7:58] Pentecostal age has to transition into
[8:02] the bride age amen because the Bible
[8:04] said if you walk in the light as he is
[8:07] in the light right that's where the
[8:10] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you
[8:13] that's when you begin to Fellowship one
[8:15] with another because see you can
[8:18] understand the system that we're now
[8:21] seeing because they're not walked in the
[8:23] light they became a denomination they
[8:25] became an organization and this is what
[8:27] brother R was trying to tell us as we
[8:29] walk in the light we must consider and
[8:31] understand we're Brethren amen right he
[8:35] started off as as a Baptist he came to
[8:37] know Jesus as a Baptist he moved from
[8:39] the Baptist to the Pentecostal from the
[8:41] Pentecostal into the very word and you
[8:44] know he knew God back then and he knew
[8:46] God better it gets better because the
[8:48] lights get better brighter right so you
[8:52] look at these things and it's a it's a
[8:53] thing that message people we've done
[8:56] we've is isolated ourselves and and I I
[8:59] don't agree with that kind of a thing
[9:02] because I believe the shuck is supposed
[9:03] to pull away from the wheat that's right
[9:05] not the wheat pull away from the Shar
[9:08] amen and how else they going to know or
[9:10] see this light if we don't Fellowship
[9:15] one with another that's what it is
[9:17] brother brandom never de dechristianize
[9:20] anybody Paul never dechristianize
[9:23] anybody they when they saw John's
[9:26] disciples they said have you believed
[9:28] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[9:30] since you believe as Christians when we
[9:33] find somebody Walking In a Different
[9:35] Light we're supposed to take that
[9:37] Christian by the grace of God and bring
[9:39] them into a greater light that's when we
[9:42] began to have fellowship if we say we
[9:45] have fellowship with him and yet we walk
[9:48] in darkness we are lying and do not
[9:51] practice the truth and it goes on to say
[9:54] if we say that we have fellowship with
[9:57] him and walk in darkness we li
[9:59] and do not the truth now how how is that
[10:03] going to be determined you know a person
[10:05] say you know we sing that song I'm in
[10:06] the light no more darkness no more night
[10:10] well you got to understand when you're
[10:14] walking in the light the light of God
[10:16] never goes out
[10:18] amen we're not talking about candl
[10:21] light we're talking about the light of
[10:24] the shikina glory
[10:26] amen and remember as we go on the light
[10:31] that we walk in
[10:32] tonight is different from the light that
[10:34] the Pentecostal walked
[10:37] in because we're living in an age where
[10:40] it's not anym it's no longer touch not
[10:42] taste not handle not it's not the law
[10:45] amen we're living in an age where God
[10:49] has declared that we never sin in the
[10:52] first place am that's right now in this
[10:55] age we want you to understand because we
[10:58] are in our flesh
[11:00] I heard brother brandom just say we
[11:02] purge ourselves every
[11:05] day right that's why we don't go through
[11:07] a Great
[11:08] Tribulation because we're constantly
[11:11] cleansing ourselves By the Light of the
[11:14] word we say washing ourselves by the
[11:17] water of the word amen right one of the
[11:21] things that I think that we when we walk
[11:24] in the light when two people Fellowship
[11:27] when we Fellowship you know we
[11:29] understand what that is brother B said
[11:31] two fellows in a ship but but what it is
[11:33] is when we Fellowship fellow there's
[11:36] nothing like Fellowship matter of fact
[11:37] we supposed to come together the more in
[11:39] the last day to fellowship and to
[11:42] worship and that means we we talk about
[11:45] the word of God we talk about our
[11:47] testimonies we we give praise to God
[11:50] because I don't know about you that
[11:52] strengthens me and I believe that the
[11:55] body is here to strengthen one another
[11:58] but the only way that we will'll be able
[11:59] to do that is Walking In The Light let
[12:03] me so you'll
[12:05] understand there's no big eyes and
[12:07] little 's in the light we're all the we
[12:13] how can I say it we're we're the same
[12:14] peas in the pod amen right we we can't
[12:18] judge each other uh in the way that we
[12:22] did in
[12:24] denomination right because in
[12:27] this uh life
[12:29] you ought to be dead amen is that right
[12:33] Paul say it's not I that live but Christ
[12:36] that lives in me so we're not here to to
[12:41] uh uh reflect ourselves or to reflect
[12:44] our achievements see whenever you see
[12:46] people doing that they're not in the
[12:49] light according to the Easter seal you
[12:52] know brother random said the true exper
[12:55] Holy Ghost experience doesn't glorify
[12:57] itself doesn't glorify Moses doesn't
[13:00] glorify Elijah it only glorifies Jesus
[13:04] Christ that's when you know that you are
[13:06] truly in the light when you're
[13:08] glorifying Jesus
[13:10] Christ now here we go the the any
[13:15] questions
[13:17] comments
[13:18] okay if we say we have no
[13:22] sin now but you said but Brother Bruce
[13:24] you said we don't have any
[13:26] sin what is sin
[13:29] sin is
[13:31] unbelief if we say we don't have no sins
[13:35] we are deceiving ourselves and the truth
[13:38] is not in us I ask you a question
[13:40] tonight can a sinner
[13:46] sin the answer is no The Sinner is a
[13:51] sinner only Christians can
[13:55] sin The Sinner is an unbeliever he's not
[13:57] a believer but a Christian who is a
[14:00] Believer has moments of
[14:03] unbelief so they're the only ones that
[14:05] can
[14:06] sin let me ask you another question is
[14:10] lying stealing
[14:12] cheating are those things
[14:15] sin
[14:17] no they attributes of sin which is
[14:22] unbelief right so we got the word of God
[14:26] we got the blood of Jesus in our day
[14:28] this message come to what dress the
[14:31] bride amen but in order to be dressed
[14:33] you must be justified you must be
[14:36] Sanctified you must be filled and sealed
[14:40] amen with the attributes of God
[14:44] right you understand what I'm saying
[14:46] because when we were in this Pentecostal
[14:49] age we thought we had it all with the
[14:51] speaking in Tong jumping and shouting
[14:52] and all of that and I'm not saying
[14:53] anything wrong with that but there was
[14:56] more light amen that came came our way
[14:59] that bring brings us I was talking to a
[15:02] Pentecostal friend of mine yesterday I
[15:04] said go home and read uh second Peter I
[15:06] believe it was the first chapter uh
[15:08] where it talks about the attributes of
[15:10] God and uh and so I told him to do that
[15:14] I said because in that chapter it talks
[15:17] about the divine nature of God after
[15:20] your uh Faith virtue knowledge
[15:22] Temperance patient godliness brotherly
[15:24] kindness you know and there in the
[15:26] Divine love now that is the full statue
[15:29] of Christ that is his divine nature and
[15:32] only those who have the divine nature
[15:35] will be taken in the
[15:37] Rapture right so we see those things and
[15:41] we understand those things what a what
[15:44] what what was Jesus what let me show you
[15:47] something um let me see go with me to uh
[15:52] Mark 14 3 and
[15:57] N Jesus Christ is the word that's
[16:01] correct but we understand that the
[16:05] word is unveiling it it reveals itself
[16:09] unfolds
[16:11] itself and and the and the and in that
[16:14] day of the
[16:15] law they knew that uh
[16:19] prostitutions a pro those who were
[16:21] prostitutes were were
[16:23] unclean they weren't even you weren't
[16:25] allowed to even be around them dare not
[16:28] you touch one amen and and and and and
[16:31] and because they were unclean and and if
[16:33] you would uh find yourself in a unclean
[16:35] position you had to go to the priest and
[16:38] he had to do the ceremonial things to
[16:40] say you're
[16:42] clean but but
[16:44] anyhow Jesus was the
[16:47] word and remember he said except you
[16:50] believe that I am he you should likewise
[16:53] die in your sin now what was the
[16:56] difference between the law and Jesus
[17:00] us the law came to as a school Master as
[17:05] the Paul says it came to teach us what
[17:08] sin or what how Wicked we are let's put
[17:12] it in our own terms it was a school
[17:15] Master right because how can you repent
[17:18] from something that you don't even know
[17:19] it's wrong amen I think I was talking
[17:22] with Josh or someone I was talking with
[17:24] just the other day how these little kids
[17:26] can curse and say all kind of stuff but
[17:28] they don't even know it's wrong because
[17:30] they have no word they have no Bible the
[17:32] nature of a man is
[17:34] wrong right but that Bible the word was
[17:37] is God so it came to show mankind his
[17:41] nature is wrong and then it said came to
[17:44] show mankind you can't make it until you
[17:47] change your nature amen so the law was
[17:50] came came to condemn us teach us and to
[17:53] condemn us to make us see that there's
[17:56] no way that you can make it amen right
[17:59] without Grace so Jesus came and he comes
[18:03] with Grace and Truth as he has done in
[18:07] this hour because remember in the seven
[18:09] Church ages it was all
[18:12] law and as the message we brought that
[18:16] law with us amen But as God began to
[18:18] really unfold and unveil to us the grace
[18:21] and truth now we're seeing we were
[18:24] already free amen that's right God made
[18:27] us free and and in this message you have
[18:31] to accept your freedom in order to be
[18:34] free amen right so let's turn to Mark 14
[18:40] 3-9 because we're talking about walking
[18:43] in the light as he is in the light
[18:44] that's my subject walk in the light as
[18:47] he in is in the light right and the
[18:49] blood of Jesus do what it cleanse you
[18:51] from all unrighteousness and with all of
[18:53] that you have Fellowship one with
[18:55] another why because you understand that
[18:58] the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ get
[18:59] cleanses me cleanses you too there is no
[19:02] way we can be cleansed of ourselves we
[19:06] can't sanctify ourselves Jesus said I
[19:08] sanctify myself that you might be
[19:10] Sanctified so everything from
[19:13] justification sanctification baptism of
[19:15] the Holy Ghost to the infilling of the
[19:17] complete character of Christ is done to
[19:20] mankind by the grace of God Amen none of
[19:24] us has a place to boast amen all right
[19:27] God took it out of our hand hands that's
[19:29] right there is no place to boast or to
[19:31] raise ourselves up in a prideful way as
[19:34] if we're something because whenever you
[19:37] in Pride you are in
[19:40] darkness
[19:42] yes starting at the third verse and
[19:44] being in Bethany in the house of Simon
[19:47] the leopard as he sat at me there came a
[19:51] woman having alabaster box of ointment
[19:53] and of Spiga very precious and she break
[19:57] the box and Ed on his head now now I
[20:01] want you to understand this there are in
[20:04] they are in the House of a leopard first
[20:08] of all they're wrong amen the leopard is
[20:11] unclean and the house of the leopard is
[20:13] unclean when you were a leopard you had
[20:16] a certain place they put you you were
[20:20] excommunicated you were not supposed to
[20:22] not the Jews now the Gentiles may have
[20:25] fellowship with leopards but the Jews
[20:27] knew that leprosy was unclean amen but
[20:31] here they are in the House of Simon the
[20:34] leopard and leopardy represents what
[20:38] sin and we find out there in the house
[20:41] of leprosy
[20:43] judging the woman with the alabaster box
[20:47] ain't that something that's how we do we
[20:49] judge one another one is a leopard and
[20:50] one is a
[20:53] and both of them are caused by by
[20:55] sin and unbelief yeah right and there
[20:59] come a woman having an alabaster box of
[21:01] ointment of Spiker very precious and she
[21:05] break the box and poured it on his head
[21:10] now I want you to understand this oil
[21:12] was very expensive oil okay it wasn't
[21:16] something cheap it was it was also it
[21:19] was used amen for the burial you know
[21:25] and other things I'm sure but right now
[21:29] she's anointed by God think about this
[21:31] because this is not her mindset that's
[21:33] right and as we know that God works on
[21:36] both ends so here she is Anointed by God
[21:40] a
[21:42] prostitute not even converted yet thank
[21:44] you Lord but she had a seed in her
[21:48] that's right you understand me what
[21:50] makes us believe this message even when
[21:52] we were
[21:53] Sinners it was that seed that God put in
[21:56] us and God anointed
[21:59] us Drew us to this message when all of
[22:04] the religious system like
[22:07] Simon and their uppy attitude looking at
[22:12] Jesus with dirty feet amen and that's
[22:16] how they do it they they they invite him
[22:19] to church and I don't want to get into
[22:22] that cuz that's another little thing but
[22:24] we we never want to invite Jesus to
[22:26] church and pay him no attention that's
[22:29] right we come to worship Him amen right
[22:33] and understand by the grace of God the
[22:35] only way you can truly worship him you
[22:37] have to worship Him in spirit and in
[22:38] truth and when you in spirit and truth
[22:41] you're free yes sir and people should
[22:44] never come to church in bondage because
[22:46] you're
[22:47] free and when you allow your mind
[22:50] remember it's your mind this is where
[22:51] the battle is yes sir your mind your
[22:54] mind is your prison house your mind will
[22:57] enchain you
[22:59] amen right but your heart sets you free
[23:02] the revelation of God in your heart sets
[23:06] you free this is one of the better
[23:08] scriptures that I find you know in the
[23:11] whole Bible when when John is looking
[23:14] and and there's no one worthy to open
[23:17] the
[23:19] book that means no one amen no matter
[23:22] how great Moses was how great Elijah was
[23:26] how great all of the the m messengers of
[23:29] the Old and New Testament there was no
[23:31] one worthy amen so how can you ever be
[23:34] worthy that's right your Redemption can
[23:37] could only come by the bloody lamb Jesus
[23:40] Christ himself see you still go back to
[23:43] the blood right amen because I want you
[23:45] to understand from Adam all the way up
[23:48] what did what did Cain and uh what did
[23:50] Adam do to deserve blood he was in the
[23:53] wrong he was a sinner there was nothing
[23:56] he could do to save himself
[23:59] but Salvation is of the Lord and God
[24:02] killed an innocent
[24:03] lamb sheded his blood to redeem Adam and
[24:08] Eve y'all understand me if it was free
[24:11] then it's free now if it was Grace then
[24:15] is Grace now right so how can we not
[24:19] love one
[24:20] another no matter what we
[24:23] do when people do wrong we still got to
[24:25] love them you got to love your enemy you
[24:28] got to love your brother you got to love
[24:30] your sister you understand what I'm
[24:32] saying because the moment you feel like
[24:35] you are in a place where you don't have
[24:37] to forgive or have to love you are in
[24:41] darkness that's the way it
[24:45] works
[24:48] now you can hate the
[24:51] sin you may not even like the person's
[24:55] ways but you got to love them
[24:58] and I don't mean filio love I mean agape
[25:00] love willing to lay your life down yes
[25:03] sir right so fellowship with God by
[25:07] Revelation oh I didn't finish that I'm
[25:09] sorry that scripture where I was so what
[25:13] happens something's
[25:15] changing first of all here is the woman
[25:18] with the alabaster box I'm I'm showing
[25:20] you now because this is the kind of
[25:22] stuff God does he will do this to you
[25:24] that's right he he's no he's it's not
[25:27] different there's no different here in
[25:29] the law God jumps in Grace amen they
[25:32] couldn't even recognize Grace until Paul
[25:34] came amen Paul had to teach the the the
[25:39] the the the the the old Jewish people
[25:42] what Grace was all about what did they
[25:44] have a struggle absolutely amen because
[25:46] we find them in Galatians still trying
[25:49] Amen to circumcise
[25:51] people right Christians that supposed to
[25:54] accept Christ but then he here come Paul
[25:57] said you you Bewitched amen that's right
[26:01] something body has cast a spell on you
[26:03] because the law never worked only the
[26:06] grace of God and and this grace of God
[26:09] comes through the shed blood of Jesus
[26:12] Christ of course God from the beginning
[26:15] you know decided this is what he would
[26:18] do but no matter how religious religious
[26:22] you become without the blood of Jesus
[26:24] Christ applied to your life you gone
[26:27] you've come nowhere
[26:29] because religion will never save you as
[26:31] I said and everybody has religion so
[26:34] here's this woman everybody knows she's
[26:36] a prostitute and she's coming into
[26:38] Simon's house and nobody stops
[26:42] her and we find out that Simon knows her
[26:47] now how did he comes to know
[26:49] her y'all understand what I'm saying he
[26:52] wasn't the only one that knew
[26:55] her but but the point is he's trying to
[26:58] scorn her did anybody try to stop
[27:01] her no before you know she's at jesus'
[27:04] feet amen who invited her to
[27:08] come Jesus did amen that's the truth let
[27:12] me it's amazing because Jesus said I do
[27:16] nothing except the father show me amen
[27:18] so he knew she was coming
[27:21] amen he knew like I said he got there
[27:25] before she got there and he knew she was
[27:27] coming so he had to be there when she
[27:29] would come that's how it works God knows
[27:33] every move you make yes sir he sees you
[27:36] he hears you before you speak a word he
[27:39] answer you before you even call that's
[27:42] God Amen this is not something what God
[27:44] said well what's going to happen next he
[27:46] [Music]
[27:48] knows and and I'm saying this to you so
[27:51] that you understand when you truly have
[27:54] a revel Hallelujah when you truly have a
[27:57] revelation of God in you you are an
[28:01] invincible person and understand this
[28:04] you can fellowship with him every day
[28:06] all day and how you do that to have the
[28:09] Revelation that God said I'll never
[28:11] leave you nor forsake you and Jesus is
[28:14] always there with you whether you know
[28:16] it or not this Dimension that we're
[28:18] living in is awful amen that's right but
[28:22] he's here
[28:24] right we know that because of the the
[28:27] word of God being open 1963 y'all know
[28:30] how it works but my point is once you
[28:33] it's a revelation you can say it in your
[28:35] mind with your mou all you want to but
[28:37] until you understand that Jesus Christ
[28:39] is here and he's with you every day then
[28:42] it will change your way of thinking
[28:44] change your way of walking and you'll be
[28:47] very cautious on how you look because
[28:49] you know he's sitting there with you not
[28:51] just with you but in you right so here
[28:55] it is they didn't recognize Jesus they
[28:57] didn't know who he was but here as
[28:59] according to with the prophet of God
[29:01] this woman knew that there was another
[29:05] prostitute and you know how Word of
[29:07] Mouth goes she had been saved by Jesus
[29:10] from death amen that's right they caught
[29:12] her in
[29:14] adultery and he freed her why what did
[29:17] he say woman where be your accusers do
[29:20] y'all understand this bride of Christ
[29:22] where be your accusers she says I have
[29:25] none then Jesus says well you're free
[29:29] because I have nothing to accuse you of
[29:31] either what was he telling her here was
[29:34] a seed of God called in the act and God
[29:37] gives her Amazing Grace and according to
[29:40] the law she should have been stoned and
[29:42] the man that's right that's the truth
[29:44] but we know organizations they always
[29:46] break the word because they didn't bring
[29:48] the man they brought her only they
[29:50] brought her you understand what I'm
[29:52] saying so what I'm trying to say is to
[29:54] you that applies to the Bride of Jesus
[29:57] Christ today hey where are your accusers
[30:00] I think it's Isaiah
[30:02] 57 uh uh I believe um no uh no weapon
[30:06] formed against you should prosper and
[30:08] you know you're going to judge them you
[30:10] know that judge you and all you know how
[30:12] the scripture go so but but this is
[30:15] walking in the
[30:18] light right every age had their light so
[30:22] what is your
[30:25] Revelation I'm free yes sir I'm living
[30:29] in the Shina of Glory I'm being changed
[30:32] every day not by power not by might but
[30:36] by his Spirit he that begun the good
[30:39] work in me is faithful to complet it
[30:41] yeah do you understand that and it
[30:44] doesn't just apply to you it applies to
[30:46] your brothers and sisters it doesn't
[30:49] matter where they are in the program all
[30:52] wheat does not grow to maturity at the
[30:54] same pace
[30:58] everybody has their their portion in
[31:00] this and God showed that through his
[31:03] disciples can you imagine being with 12
[31:06] gangsters and one being a
[31:10] devil that's what they look
[31:13] like how many of y'all would have
[31:14] followed Jesus come on
[31:19] somebody yeah put yourself there this
[31:23] man don't have nothing
[31:25] naturally foxes have whole bir bir have
[31:28] nesses but the son of man have no place
[31:30] to lay his head amen he doesn't even
[31:32] have a real full change of clothing amen
[31:35] that's right didn't he have nothing
[31:37] right to be fully buried
[31:40] in nothing he had
[31:42] nothing and y'all look like Vagabond
[31:45] roing roaming from one place to another
[31:47] that's
[31:48] right Jesus the Lord did that on purpose
[31:52] he could have come looking like a
[31:54] prince but he chose the low life you
[31:56] know why because he want that's where a
[32:00] lot of save people that's where a lot of
[32:02] seed is at the end of the day he says
[32:05] the highways the byways now you know the
[32:08] the the rejects of this generation
[32:11] that's where I am but guess what we're
[32:14] Prejudice that's the trth we become so
[32:17] Prejudice why because they got to smell
[32:20] right yeah they got to look right oh no
[32:23] tattoos forget it right but you're not
[32:27] not even walking in the
[32:29] light with that kind of an attitude it's
[32:33] not the attitude of
[32:35] Jesus it was Satan who was full of Pride
[32:39] amen that's right until you become
[32:43] nothing you you got to become nothing
[32:46] and and this is what this is what
[32:47] walking in the light I I I was told and
[32:51] I don't know how true it is they said
[32:52] when brother brandham died and they had
[32:54] his funeral they said all kind of
[32:56] homeless people was at his funeral
[32:58] and they basically had testimonies what
[33:00] brother bradam did for
[33:03] them how many of us are reaching
[33:07] out and could have a testimony like that
[33:10] John is a serious
[33:11] book I love John because John types out
[33:14] the
[33:15] bride right this word must be be real to
[33:19] you alive to you and how are we going to
[33:21] make it happen we have to pray and seek
[33:25] God face
[33:27] so that the love of God will fill us and
[33:32] seal us because when you come to a place
[33:35] when you don't have no human effort to
[33:37] do good but you're doing good see
[33:41] because doing good when it's just human
[33:44] effort it's religion it could be just
[33:47] religion but when you have a nature in
[33:50] you that you're doing so good and you're
[33:52] loving people is that right they say
[33:54] Jesus Lord when did we visit you when
[33:57] did feed you they had no record of doing
[34:00] it amen right because they by Nature
[34:05] were performing the duties of
[34:07] God and oh I can remember when I did
[34:10] this for so and so n no n it's not
[34:13] that you it's just okay so what happens
[34:17] is in this hour
[34:21] right you still have people concerned
[34:25] about Mary and what she did and I'mma
[34:27] keep keep moving like I said you know
[34:30] but but why did God said wheresoever
[34:33] this gospel shall be preached the n9th
[34:36] verse who wheresoever this gospel shall
[34:40] be preached throughout the whole world
[34:43] this also that she have done shall be
[34:47] spoken of for a
[34:51] memorial because you know what we have
[34:54] no idea what she had to press through
[34:56] that's right
[34:58] knowing that she could easily be pulled
[35:00] out and stoned amen but this woman was
[35:04] so captivated by Jesus and what he had
[35:06] done for someone else see
[35:09] testimonies has a great deal has a great
[35:11] should have a great impact on on a
[35:14] Believer or a person who don't even
[35:16] believe when when they hear what God has
[35:18] done for someone else it gives them hope
[35:20] it quickens them but this is the thing
[35:23] that I love when Jesus
[35:28] spoke to this woman and says
[35:30] woman basically your sins be
[35:35] forgiven what did she
[35:37] do it wasn't her Works she was obedient
[35:42] to the Holy
[35:43] Spirit she didn't even
[35:46] ask he said your sin be
[35:50] forgiven and the truth of the matter is
[35:53] what we we fail to
[35:54] see that before the foundation of the
[35:57] world your sins were forgiven
[35:59] amen and all God is asking is for you to
[36:03] walk in that light as he is in the light
[36:08] when I see her anointing his body for
[36:12] death I see God in return anointing my
[36:15] body for life
[36:17] amen and you see how God Amen uses this
[36:21] woman in such a special way to uh make
[36:24] us see the
[36:25] contrast between with religion and Grace
[36:30] amen and that's what we come to this
[36:32] message to see the difference between
[36:34] religion and Grace because everybody
[36:37] every Christian every Buddha Buddha got
[36:40] religion Allah has religion everybody
[36:42] everybody has something good they do
[36:45] amen but none of that saves you
[36:48] amen let's move
[36:51] on there's a lot could be sa let's go uh
[36:54] the Bible said if we we have not sinned
[36:57] we make him a Li and his word is is not
[36:59] in us can anybody say that you do not I
[37:02] mean there are times like you say even
[37:04] when it comes to your healing and your
[37:06] deliverance you says Lord help thy my
[37:09] unbelief it's already done but we F we
[37:13] we wrestle we against this that's why
[37:17] Paul said I crucify it daily I must put
[37:19] the thing to death that Christ may live
[37:22] every day right this is your
[37:25] enemy right this is what the devil devil
[37:28] use to fight your spiritual growth but
[37:32] can I say
[37:33] this and I want you to see this uh every
[37:37] battle you go through is to glorify God
[37:41] no matter what you go through God is
[37:43] going to get the glory right for an
[37:46] example I give you an example when the
[37:49] Hebrew boys as I would finish
[37:54] U continue that message about the
[37:56] darkness when the Hebrew boys were uh
[38:00] thrown uh you know uh in the fire it was
[38:05] their darkest
[38:07] hour but guess what it was what God was
[38:11] using to make the Heathen Praise Him
[38:15] amen he was glorified by the heathens
[38:19] amen up take
[38:21] Daniel nebuch NE Daniel Daniel we know
[38:25] that thou God is God
[38:28] and and when I think about that the
[38:29] Bible said every knee shall bow every
[38:32] tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ
[38:35] is Lord to the glory of God Amen y'all
[38:39] understand me we talking about oh we
[38:40] we'll write another book of Acts the
[38:42] book of Acts never stopped amen that's
[38:45] right I mean even in the church ages
[38:47] when they those people were dying in the
[38:49] name of Jesus they were writing a book
[38:51] of
[38:52] Acts those that went to death and those
[38:55] that overcome it's it's not in the book
[38:57] but they were re they were actually
[38:59] still a continuation of
[39:02] Acts I I don't even know why people
[39:04] don't even see that but we think that
[39:07] we've got to have the raising of the
[39:08] Dead no the book of Acts was also a lot
[39:11] of
[39:15] suffering they were able to endure the
[39:17] punishment or endure the suffering in
[39:20] the name of Jesus Christ because that's
[39:23] the only way they could have done it you
[39:26] cannot endure
[39:29] pain and hold your standard in God
[39:33] without God's
[39:35] anointing
[39:39] amen yeah God will give you Supreme
[39:42] Grace or Supreme faith in the Supreme
[39:45] hour
[39:47] amen it's God not
[39:50] you none of us could have stood up even
[39:53] even Daniel couldn't have stood up to
[39:54] those Lions without the anointing of God
[39:57] amen the Hebrew boys thrown in the fiery
[40:01] F y'all see what I'm saying but they had
[40:03] a revelation who God was I shall not be
[40:07] and I Shall Not Bow I shall not break
[40:10] and that's what John is basically saying
[40:12] because where Satan attack us more than
[40:15] any place you're not
[40:19] saved you need more God how much God how
[40:23] much more God going to give you yeah you
[40:26] know what I'm saying you either s you
[40:28] got it or you don't amen you say well oh
[40:31] I need the Holy Ghost so bad who's to
[40:33] say you don't have it but as long as you
[40:36] don't believe you don't have it you
[40:38] don't have it amen because this age is
[40:43] about faith in the word of God Amen
[40:46] that's it and I believe if you have
[40:48] faith in the word of God as the word of
[40:51] God is preach how many how many how many
[40:54] and how many the Bible said you've never
[40:56] sin in the first place that's right now
[40:59] God put that before you is that tough
[41:02] one but by faith I believe
[41:05] that it's a revelation and if it's a
[41:08] revelation I'm
[41:09] free there is now no condemnation to
[41:13] those who walk not after the flesh but
[41:15] after the spirit why should I condemn
[41:18] myself if I got the Holy
[41:23] Ghost are you going to make mistakes oh
[41:26] sure but then there's coming a time I
[41:28] believe those mistakes are going to
[41:29] vanish as we move into that Perfection
[41:32] because the that's what the scripture
[41:34] says of Peter said if these virtues
[41:36] abound and be in you you should never
[41:38] fall you won't
[41:40] error you'll be like him the the divine
[41:44] nature is in total control and I believe
[41:47] that I know maybe others don't but I do
[41:51] second chapter please we'll read a
[41:53] little bit that any
[41:56] questions yes yes
[42:16] sir you answered
[42:18] that they are
[42:20] believers but you have
[42:23] stages and some Believers are just
[42:25] Justified
[42:27] and and some Believers are
[42:30] Sanctified and some Believers have the
[42:32] Holy Spirit right and all that category
[42:36] it it's a growth period right but
[42:39] understand this the Bible said if a man
[42:42] confess with his mouth and believe with
[42:45] his heart it's made unto
[42:47] salvation so you got to understand
[42:49] salvation is a process like growing in
[42:52] from a boy to a
[42:54] man and that's what salvation is like
[42:57] it's like growing up but but the truth
[42:59] of the matter is you still believe
[43:02] you're a man
[43:03] right so that's how it is with the Son
[43:06] of God when you are a son of God you
[43:08] grow from a kid all the way up but you
[43:10] still the Son of God you're going to
[43:12] make mistakes but that's what the blood
[43:14] of Jesus Christ is all about but a
[43:16] sinner is an
[43:19] unbeliever you know and when I say a a
[43:22] real unbeliever someone no matter what
[43:24] you try to do to prove to him that Jesus
[43:26] Christ is Lord they don't
[43:31] believe say that
[43:36] again oh the Bible said that God Reigns
[43:39] on the just and the unjust so when it
[43:41] rains outside it doesn't rain just on
[43:43] the corn but it also rains on the wheat
[43:47] too and weed excuse me so that same
[43:50] mercy and Grace that's given to uh the
[43:53] wheat is always given also given to the
[43:56] the weed
[43:59] yeah this is that's why B the Bible
[44:01] tells us don't be jealous of the people
[44:03] out there that's not serving God and
[44:05] they getting all this kind of stuff this
[44:07] is their
[44:08] reward but for the true Christian our
[44:12] reward is heaven and in a in a in a in a
[44:15] a body that that can't sin can't die
[44:18] can't get weak you know we have we have
[44:22] a a a glorious body fashioned by
[44:25] God yeah
[44:28] but that's what I love about God and and
[44:31] I say that young man
[44:34] because God loves The
[44:36] Sinner he hates the
[44:39] sin because he's the creator of all
[44:42] things God said he would that none
[44:44] should perish and he knows what they
[44:47] made out
[44:48] of God has no pleasure in condemning
[44:52] people but because of their choosing
[44:54] because of who they are because of what
[44:56] they are they make the wrong
[44:59] choice but people oh God did that no
[45:02] this thing would have been like heaven
[45:04] if man hadn't
[45:07] fall take it back to where it come from
[45:10] and
[45:12] so it's it's it's if God can love a
[45:16] sinner we can love a sinner
[45:19] too yeah yes sir
[45:32] when a
[45:33] man it's there's a difference in the
[45:36] sense that conception and birth is two
[45:39] different things when you're conceived
[45:41] into your mother's
[45:42] womb you're being fashioned and formed
[45:47] right you have no life of your own
[45:49] because you're living off of her life
[45:52] right it's like a lot of people that
[45:53] come to church they they accept Jesus
[45:55] Christ as their savior
[45:57] and I want to say this that God doesn't
[45:59] abort any of his children there's no
[46:01] miscarriages with God right every true
[46:06] conception he that begun the good work
[46:08] in you is faithful to complete it so
[46:12] every conception of God grows from that
[46:16] that little thing in the womb and and
[46:19] and and comes up and and at that time of
[46:23] Deliverance where you take a breath and
[46:25] become your own that's where it is you
[46:29] understand even in nature teaches us
[46:30] that that even the child once it's still
[46:33] in the womb a lot of people depend on
[46:35] the church right you see what I'm saying
[46:37] once you get the Holy Ghost you know you
[46:39] don't depend on the on the church
[46:40] because you got the Holy Ghost within
[46:47] yourself but God God that little life in
[46:50] you is just as important to God as a
[46:53] grown
[46:55] man and it's his work work not
[47:00] ours did I answer your question okay any
[47:05] other questions any other
[47:06] comments
[47:10] preacher
[47:11] okay anytime you know if you wanted to
[47:14] comment on anything it it's amazing
[47:16] because he's been teaching on first John
[47:18] 2 yeah at home Bible study so but I'm
[47:21] going to let him do what he's doing over
[47:24] there but I just want you to understand
[47:26] this this is what I love about God the
[47:29] Lord said I have never lost
[47:35] one go
[47:54] ahead I've never heard that before
[47:57] the
[47:59] reason the only way I could the only
[48:02] thing person I think that would think
[48:04] that Paul is an antichrist is a woman
[48:07] [Laughter]
[48:10] preacher because Paul teaches that women
[48:13] are not supposed to preach and the Bible
[48:15] teaches
[48:22] that Christian
[48:27] well in his past we were all Antichrist
[48:31] it's not just Paul we all did Evil and
[48:34] we all if you ever had a Christian
[48:36] persecute I mean a witness to you before
[48:39] you were ready to to accept
[48:48] it yeah
[48:51] yeah yeah that would be the best way to
[48:54] say it
[48:56] about unbel yeah yeah they thought Jesus
[49:00] was a devil
[49:01] too matter of fact they called him be's
[49:05] above just going with with what he said
[49:08] see so put it this way walk in the light
[49:12] go back to that as he is in the light
[49:14] it's a
[49:15] revelation see the prostitute who was
[49:18] caught in adultery it was revealed to
[49:20] her that Jesus was the Christ the woman
[49:24] at the well who was a prostitute it was
[49:27] revealed to her that Jesus Christ but to
[49:29] the Sadducees and the Pharisees who were
[49:32] supposed to be the religious people they
[49:33] called Jesus a
[49:35] devil and a son of and and a son of uh
[49:41] um you know when
[49:44] you out of wedlock yeah so it's God who
[49:50] reveals right and he showed that it's
[49:53] God who opens the eyes of the blind for
[49:56] example example the man who was born
[49:58] blind he was blind for 30 years until
[50:00] Jesus came and they asked Jesus who did
[50:04] Sin who parent because they believed
[50:06] that the sins of the father is
[50:08] transferred to the children and Jesus
[50:11] answered no none did all of this was
[50:14] done for the glory of God so when God
[50:17] opens up a man's eye eyes regardless to
[50:20] what condition they're in or being are
[50:23] found in is all for the glory of God man
[50:26] none of us you know it's all by Grace
[50:29] not works that's any man should boast so
[50:33] all of this that we're talking about now
[50:34] that's what we we're saying you can't be
[50:37] saved by law and you you can only be
[50:39] saved by the grace of God the law and
[50:43] Grace does not mix and we've been taught
[50:45] law law law law and nothing's wrong with
[50:48] law but I believe this once you get to
[50:50] Holy Ghost you follow his law which is
[50:54] his nature
[51:00] yeah so let's read this yeah I got a few
[51:04] more minutes 1 John 2 beginning at the
[51:07] first verse my little children these
[51:09] things write I unto you that you sin not
[51:14] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[51:18] with the father Jesus Christ the
[51:20] righteous right in other words Jesus
[51:23] Christ is our perpetuation he's the man
[51:27] that stands in the Gap you know he's the
[51:29] one that actually pleads our case you
[51:31] know how we sang this song he dropped
[51:34] the charges he dropped the charges well
[51:36] Jesus he was not only the attorney but
[51:38] he was the judge he was everything so he
[51:41] threw the case out and said
[51:43] casmi you know he settled it all for us
[51:47] right by his grace cuz none of us are
[51:49] worthy of Heaven no matter what we do as
[51:54] righteous people our righteous is not of
[51:57] ourselves is of
[51:59] God that's why I don't understand people
[52:02] why people don't want to be Christians
[52:04] BR that's the be brother that's the
[52:06] greatest thing to me I've never ever uh
[52:11] say after becoming a Christian wish that
[52:14] I was not to me it's the greatest thing
[52:16] that ever happened and it's gotten
[52:18] sweeter all the time time when I thought
[52:20] I had knew God then here come more of
[52:23] God it never ends and um and you know
[52:27] like I said Even Heaven if if you know
[52:30] after this this day or after this uh
[52:33] Redemption portion of God can you
[52:36] imagine you can't even imagine how
[52:38] things will be because everything would
[52:41] be perfect nothing will miss a beat I I
[52:44] don't even know how that could how to
[52:46] conceive that the goodness of God will
[52:48] be so great and it never get it'll never
[52:51] get boring you never run you know you
[52:54] know I don't even know what to do
[52:55] because how would be his mind and his
[52:58] mind would be our mind and whatever
[53:01] however he thinks that's the way you
[53:03] know it's kind of like uh how can I say
[53:05] it he'll be the brain of
[53:08] Heaven he'll be the very brain of heaven
[53:12] and however we think is however he think
[53:14] is what we'll do as he thinks we'll know
[53:18] like Adam did I know this is off of my
[53:20] subject but how Adam knew how to name
[53:22] the CH the the animals is because he had
[53:25] the mind of God
[53:27] and however God thought whatever he
[53:29] thought of that animal Adam was able to
[53:33] see it by Revelation and called those
[53:35] animals the same thing God did call so
[53:40] that's how we'll
[53:42] be when it's all over
[53:45] amen won't be no
[53:48] secrets I love that right so he's that
[53:52] advocate he pleads for us uh don't you
[53:55] love that the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:58] right you know the Bible call him our
[54:01] high priest but now we look at it now
[54:03] the high priest has become the very
[54:05] bleeding bloody word of this message how
[54:08] can it
[54:10] not cuz anybody that listen to the
[54:12] message and really listen to it it's
[54:15] going to break you it's going to cause
[54:17] you to humble yourself it's going to
[54:19] cause you to wash yourself that word is
[54:22] going to do it see it's because it's the
[54:25] spirit of it you know it's not the
[54:27] letter of it it's the spirit God is
[54:29] alive and well right so let's do the
[54:32] second verse and then we'll we'll end it
[54:35] and he is perpetuation of our sins and
[54:38] not for ours only but also for the sins
[54:42] of the whole world and that's that's the
[54:46] that's the key the whole world was saved
[54:49] on Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:51] when it dropped on the ground according
[54:53] to the prophet of God the whole world
[54:55] was saved
[54:57] but people go to hell because they don't
[54:59] accept
[55:00] it and a pardon is not a pardon except
[55:03] it be accepted as a
[55:06] pardon it's
[55:07] simple if a person really believe that
[55:10] Jesus Christ died in their stead then
[55:14] you he becomes your sin and you becomes
[55:18] his righteousness it's a not even a fair
[55:21] trade but I'll take it
[55:24] amen you know so he's
[55:28] pleading our case and he became our sin
[55:31] that we might become his
[55:34] righteousness so in
[55:36] all that you do are you familiar with
[55:40] the with the uh
[55:47] uh Matthew 25 to 10 virgins five were
[55:51] wise and five was
[55:53] foolish five had they all was slumbered
[55:56] incept the Bible says and but they were
[56:00] all given robes talking about the
[56:03] wedding now so when when he called the
[56:06] people for the wedding when they came to
[56:07] the door they he had someone there to
[56:09] give everybody the same robe no matter
[56:12] where they were Rich poor whatever the
[56:14] case may be they all wore the same robe
[56:17] and it was and it was given to them they
[56:18] didn't have to work for it all they had
[56:20] to do is show
[56:22] up and that's what God is saying all you
[56:25] got to do is show up
[56:26] and I'll do the rest and this this this
[56:30] is all she oh brother I I I know I love
[56:33] God no if you don't love your brother
[56:36] you don't love God that's the Bible how
[56:39] can you say you love your brother or you
[56:42] know love God and hear your brother you
[56:43] see him all the time and you don't love
[56:45] him the Bible say you're a
[56:47] liar
[56:48] right cu the Bible say you haven't seen
[56:51] God at no time but how can you love him
[56:54] you've never seen him but you see your
[56:55] brother and you don't love him amen see
[56:59] that it doesn't work it can't work you
[57:02] got to love God in order to love God you
[57:04] got to love his people love your
[57:07] enemy love those that despitefully use
[57:10] you pray for them all of that but it's a
[57:13] wonderful situation because you know
[57:15] what you'll never have high blood
[57:16] pressure ERS and diabetes and because
[57:21] all of that comes from the lack of love
[57:26] all of
[57:27] that let's stand and I believe the more
[57:30] we progress and move into Divine
[57:33] love all of the the afflictions of
[57:37] unbelief and and hatred or whatever the
[57:40] case may everything that we've allowed
[57:41] Darkness because Jesus said there be no
[57:44] Darkness there's no darkness in me even
[57:47] God said there's no darkness in me he's
[57:49] the light and if he's the light Darkness
[57:53] can't dwell in light amen
[57:57] it has to be dispelled and I believe
[57:59] with all my heart once we move right
[58:02] into that light that revelation of God
[58:05] and you can see how much grace he's
[58:06] given to you you're going to want to
[58:08] give that same Grace to someone
[58:11] else right it's riches is the riches is
[58:14] beyond is beyond any money anything that
[58:17] uh this world can give this this
[58:20] revelation of truth that really is
[58:23] changing us we're not changing ourselves
[58:26] it is changing us amen let's bow father
[58:30] God we thank you for the word we thank
[58:32] you for this hour of teaching
[58:34] instructing
[58:36] encouraging uh Lord I just pray that
[58:40] something was said tonight that will not
[58:42] only glorify you but give uh us a
[58:45] greater revelation of who you are in us
[58:50] not above us not with us but in us that
[58:55] we may
[58:57] manifest you and magnify you declare you
[59:01] that people may see you in us and
[59:05] glorify
[59:06] you in heaven bless us now as we depart
[59:11] give us traveling mercy and Grace and
[59:14] let no hurt harm or danger come upon us
[59:16] Lord until we meet again in the name of
[59:19] Jesus Christ we pray amen we're thism
[59:23] amen
