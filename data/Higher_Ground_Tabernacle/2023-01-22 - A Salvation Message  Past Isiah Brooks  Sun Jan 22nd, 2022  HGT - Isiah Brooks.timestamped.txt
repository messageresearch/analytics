[44:53] you may be seated as well
[44:59] yes there is a part of us that we yeah
[45:02] it's saddened
[45:05] uh because of our departure of our
[45:07] brother Orville I couldn't do that
[45:11] but I want to encourage the Saints this
[45:14] morning
[45:16] you did not fail in faith
[45:20] faith was there but
[45:23] we must understand that the purpose and
[45:26] will of God stands
[45:31] I saw a great transition in our brother
[45:35] Orville
[45:38] and I know he made it
[45:42] I was sitting in my seat
[45:45] and I was thinking
[45:48] I came to know
[45:51] the true Son of God
[45:54] I came to know a seed a bright scene
[46:00] in this day
[46:02] and I look forward to seeing him again
[46:06] my message is not on him this morning
[46:09] we still have the funeral to do because
[46:13] I have a wonderful and I know it's on
[46:15] Saturday
[46:16] uh I don't have the time as yet but that
[46:19] will be announced
[46:22] but I like to just a simple topic this
[46:25] morning
[46:28] the message of Salvation the message
[46:32] that's what we have on
[46:36] there are many Christians
[46:40] and I've said this for the last past
[46:43] weeks
[46:45] Christianity is the greatest deception
[46:49] to what we call Christians
[46:53] because everything that is considered
[46:55] Christianity
[46:57] is not Christianity
[47:01] no matter how it looks burn Parts come
[47:04] on no matter how beautiful it may
[47:06] appears no matter how organized
[47:10] it looks so so apparently if it's not
[47:14] according to the will of God
[47:16] did you it is not Christianity
[47:23] a message a massage God always sent a
[47:26] message
[47:28] when it was time to make a change
[47:32] even in the days of Noah God sent a
[47:36] messenger by the name of Noah
[47:38] and we understand Noah preached 120
[47:42] years
[47:42] and I want you to listen closely
[47:46] out of all those years
[47:49] only eight Souls were yeah
[47:55] they heard a message of Grace
[47:59] the glass

[48:05] God took a man by the name of Moses
[48:10] placed him in Egypt
[48:13] Moses brought a message
[48:16] and he brought the people out of
[48:20] Egyptians brought him into the
[48:22] Wilderness
[48:24] God fed the Manna From Heaven
[48:28] God gave them the meat of the words
[48:32] and only two Souls
[48:35] out of that generation

[48:58] you must be born again
[49:01] vote
[49:03] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[49:06] Jesus Jesus
[49:08] came in a Time
[49:12] Israel was he said total chaos
[49:18] they had such an organized religion
[49:21] to wherein that when Jesus came
[49:25] they didn't recognize him
[49:28] the god of Heaven and Earth
[49:31] The God Who created all things
[49:35] the god of the Jews
[49:38] were not even recognized
[49:44] and only a few hey was saved under his
[49:49] name
[49:50] while he lived on earth
[49:56] he just had a small follow him
[50:00] and prior to his death
[50:03] there was a man a thief yeah
[50:09] who caught the revelations
[50:14] and he says Lord when you enter into
[50:17] your Paradise have mercy on me now Jesus
[50:21] had preached everything and a half years
[50:25] and this man saw him
[50:28] recognize the words
[50:33] by the grace of God
[50:37] um
[50:37] we're living in this day
[50:40] God sent us Malachi 4.
[50:43] how many of y'all believe we're at the
[50:45] end times
[50:48] there is no longer what we call uh
[50:51] another Pentecostal movie
[50:54] because we are we're beyond that that's
[50:57] good news
[50:59] the age before us last devonu had
[51:03] brother Branham
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:32] did you amen
[51:35] the age we only have last news
[51:38] we only have the voice of God
[51:43] what did you Hallelujah
[51:46] we're in an age of troublesome doesn't
[51:50] age of earthquakes
[51:52] pestilence in all sorts of houses
[52:08] one thing for certain yeah
[52:12] I say this with respect
[52:16] there's nothing like having a child to
[52:19] pass on
[52:22] um
[52:29] to know you'll see him again
[52:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:36] see we are in a time where the judgment
[52:39] is striking
[52:42] striking the world
[52:45] and we need a hiding place
[52:48] and I'll say this tonight or this
[52:50] morning your religion won't make it
[52:53] you need something that's deep inside
[52:57] the Bible said that the names of the
[53:00] Lord is a strong Town
[53:02] it is a city of refugee and the
[53:06] righteous run in and it's used
[53:11] we who are believers
[53:13] those of us who are eating
[53:17] and drinking blood of the son of man
[53:21] we have an assurance because Jesus said
[53:24] if you drink my blood and eat my flesh
[53:28] you shall never die
[53:31] and what is saying what is Crusade the
[53:36] flesh what is the body it is the word of
[53:40] God and what is this uh the the the
[53:42] blood it is the spirit of God hallelujah
[53:46] so you need only not only the world
[53:52] and when you have communities
[53:57] in this setting of eating this flesh
[54:03] drinking the blood
[54:05] of the son of man
[54:11] company
[54:22] think about it
[54:25] we are now back
[54:29] in the time of Eden
[54:32] see you don't look at what you see your
[54:36] natural eyes
[54:41] they will lie to you
[54:44] if the word says we're in Edens
[54:48] that's where we are sit down who's that
[54:50] I put it better than that the Bible said
[54:54] we're now sitting in Heavenly places
[55:01] the only place that is a hiding place is
[55:06] in Christ
[55:09] free from all Creeds
[55:12] from all traditions foreign
[56:15] hallelujah hallelujah
[56:17] y'all understand what I'm saying
[56:21] my God
[56:24] you and I need to know what communion is
[56:28] I'm coming just just bear with me I'm
[56:30] just kind of setting the foundation
[56:32] video
[56:35] said it like this
[56:37] God ever sends his power to the church
[56:43] it'll be his grace
[56:46] It Won't Be The Obedience of the people
[56:52] hallelujah that's in the message
[56:54] communion
[56:56] read it again because the number of
[56:59] Grace is fine
[57:02] right he said God ever sends his power
[57:06] to the church
[57:10] It Won't Be The Obedience of the people
[57:14] hallelujah and I don't know about you
[57:17] what I need is Grace this morning
[57:21] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[57:24] the Bible says if you hunger and thirst
[57:28] out the righteousness
[57:30] you shall be fears
[57:35] you can't just automatically hunger
[57:38] Hallelujah a dead man can't hunger
[57:42] Hallelujah yes you understand what I'm
[57:45] saying if you're hungry that means
[57:49] something's there
[57:51] Desiring something from God
[57:53] and holy God can satisfy this
[57:57] satisfaction Hallelujah there's nothing
[58:00] like hunger yeah
[58:02] you see a man that's hunger
[58:05] some people they even kill yeah to
[58:09] satisfy that hunger who satisfied
[58:11] there's nothing like a cry of thirst
[58:14] Hallelujah you can be so thirsty
[58:18] [Applause]
[58:20] well imagine a mirage
[58:26] Embraces there is no water
[58:29] hallelujah amen you understand me but
[58:33] God says he can fix it
[58:58] we must
[59:03] this journey is different
[59:07] nobody has ever walked this way before
[59:12] no church no church age
[59:18] is what I call a Enoch wall
[59:22] a walk where we will be translated
[59:27] no other Church age had this opportunity
[59:34] Hallelujah to step from Earth to Glory
[59:42] hallelujah hallelujah and the only way
[59:45] that you can change
[59:48] is to have the changes
[59:51] the god in you that can bring the
[59:54] transformation
[59:55] The God in you that could bring the
[59:57] change
[1:00:00] amen amen
[1:00:02] like the prophet of God says in the
[1:00:05] message communion he said it's not
[1:00:08] packing up hey
[1:00:10] it's unpacking
[1:00:13] laying aside
[1:00:17] in in the Pentecostal church
[1:00:30] we didn't know we were we were supposed
[1:00:33] to be packing
[1:00:34] we supposed to be unpacking we saw him
[1:00:37] that's right this is
[1:00:47] it does so easily beside us
[1:00:51] hallelujah that we might run with
[1:00:54] patience amen
[1:01:07] did not come to a group
[1:01:11] this message is an individual
[1:01:16] it didn't come to Enoch's family
[1:01:24] is the individual walking
[1:01:28] and you must Hallelujah you must come to
[1:01:31] know who you are you understand what I'm
[1:01:35] saying
[1:01:39] you must know
[1:01:41] within your heart don't vote that you
[1:01:44] are called to be bribe
[1:01:48] and when you come to understand your
[1:01:51] call to be brown you understand that you
[1:01:54] have been exposed
[1:01:57] to one husband and that's Jesus Christ
[1:02:00] Alone
[1:02:03] hallelujah hallelujah you know you don't
[1:02:05] hear the name of Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] but that name must be exhausted
[1:02:13] is that right he said if you exalt me
[1:02:26] I want this might sound like a
[1:02:29] Pentecostal message
[1:02:32] but I'm gonna tell you this is the kind
[1:02:34] of Pentecostal message that would
[1:02:35] preached
[1:02:37] on the day of Pentecost
[1:02:39] and if it worked then it works
[1:02:46] that is greater than the message of the
[1:02:49] Gospel
[1:02:51] the death barrier and resurrection of
[1:02:54] Jesus Christ
[1:03:02] for your information
[1:03:06] all the Patriots in the Old
[1:03:08] Testaments don't have never been
[1:03:11] anything
[1:03:14] without Christ
[1:03:19] Apostles
[1:03:21] of the New Testament
[1:03:25] everything
[1:03:27] without Christ song hallelujah

[1:03:34] what is it to gain the whole world
[1:03:42] to gain the whole world
[1:03:46] and lose your soul the whole time
[1:03:53] in the message communion
[1:03:55] brother William says
[1:03:58] communion is to talk to
[1:04:03] commune with
[1:04:06] something that you can speak to us
[1:04:17] a wafer cannot speak back

[1:36:47] three yes see you know
[1:36:51] it is here to them that are lost
[1:36:54] listen to what he says in whom the God
[1:36:58] of this World Police and could you Don
[1:37:01] the Jews
[1:37:02] they're blinded the minds of them which
[1:37:06] believe not
[1:37:07] intelligence lest the light of the
[1:37:10] Glorious Gospel of cool Christ I thank
[1:37:13] you
[1:37:16] it's the image of God
[1:37:19] shine unto them all new and so when
[1:37:24] you're preaching the gospel
[1:37:26] that gospel You Preach
[1:37:29] supposed to reflect the image
[1:37:32] if it reflects anything but Christ
[1:37:40] it has to reflect Christ perfect
[1:37:43] decreased
[1:37:47] for we preach not ourselves
[1:37:53] but Christ Jesus
[1:37:57] and ourselves your servants for Jesus
[1:38:00] sake
[1:38:01] who's preaching here
[1:38:04] say Paul that's
[1:38:06] that's preaching
[1:38:09] pepper Hallelujah and William Branham
[1:38:12] never preached himself
[1:38:15] he preached Jesus that's what he did
[1:38:19] amen
[1:38:21] hey he preached it like Paul Bridge
[1:38:24] yes sir amen and ourselves the Servants
[1:38:28] of Jesus saying new songs
[1:38:33] oh Jesus oh Jesus
[1:38:42] the true Mercy Seat
[1:38:44] uh
[1:38:46] coming from the message
[1:38:49] the Mighty God unveiled
[1:38:52] you 1964.
[1:38:56] now when the veil was rent at Calvary I
[1:38:59] mean
[1:39:01] The Mercy Seat came into plain view now
[1:39:06] but what happened
[1:39:09] it was hanging on Calvary
[1:39:15] dripping in blood
[1:39:18] as they had took the blood it goes on
[1:39:22] Peter's song year after year
[1:39:25] at the cleansing of the sanctuary
[1:39:30] of the mercy
[1:39:32] results
[1:39:36] with his Great Mighty stroke of
[1:39:39] lightning power Ave
[1:39:41] something
[1:39:45] lit
[1:39:46] the old Badge of veil
[1:39:49] from top to bottom
[1:39:53] and The Mercy Seat came into planes and
[1:39:56] it says to me so I called
[1:39:58] the real Levine genuine Lamb of God
[1:40:04] singing in plain view of Calvary
[1:40:08] okay
[1:40:12] paid the price himself
[1:40:28] Jesus Christ
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:43] oh
[1:40:45] but at last
[1:40:48] minute I thought the tradition the
[1:40:52] tradition of the church fathers in that
[1:40:54] day many times
[1:40:57] by their
[1:41:01] Traditions
[1:41:05] if they would have known the scriptures
[1:41:09] each peace would have come like the
[1:41:11] Chinese
[1:41:13] tags
[1:41:16] the Old Testament prophecy
[1:41:23] if they had been taught the scriptures
[1:41:31] as Moses said
[1:41:34] here that to do to this day
[1:41:37] they veiled
[1:41:39] it's still over their hearts is that
[1:41:43] right right because remember when Jesus
[1:41:46] came consciousness
[1:41:48] Moses disciples
[1:41:51] we're followers of Moses
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:55] [Applause]
[1:41:59] and when you call yourself a brand of
[1:42:02] Mighty you're now a denomination
[1:42:08] amen you're doing the same thing they
[1:42:10] did
[1:42:12] we are of Moses
[1:42:14] hallelujah hallelujah no no Paul said
[1:42:18] some say I'm a cephas
[1:42:21] some say I am Apollos
[1:42:24] said no no no no don't even consider me
[1:42:27] consider amen hallelujah
[1:42:31] there's only one that died for you
[1:42:34] there's only one that rules for you
[1:42:38] Jesus himself
[1:42:41] [Applause]
[1:42:44] okay
[1:42:49] man he said it's still over their hearts
[1:42:52] we've done the same thing
[1:42:56] but this is God
[1:42:59] the suffering and the atonement
[1:43:01] experience
[1:43:08] don't be saying to him
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] hold him in plain view
[1:43:18] there he is the mighty conqueror
[1:43:22] says he rent the veil in two come on
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:36] John said I heard a lion you know I DJ
[1:43:40] if you uh uh
[1:43:42] and I look to see
[1:43:46] and when I turned he calls him she's
[1:43:48] doing it I saw the mercy scene

[1:43:56] looked like it was slain from the
[1:44:00] foundation of the world y'all understand
[1:44:03] me what did John take us back to it
[1:44:07] beating bloody words
[1:44:19] hallelujah hallelujah

[1:44:28] I feel him all over me
[1:44:30] I trust you're feeling the same thing
[1:44:35] he came he never knew the mercy
[1:44:39] seeding in clear views of the
[1:44:42] congregation
[1:44:44] but them being on the popular opinions
[1:44:55] foreign
[1:45:01] all the messengers I'm almost done
[1:45:05] all the messengers of all ages

[1:45:12] never themselves

[1:48:16] went into that cave and I saw his I saw
[1:48:19] the table where he talked about it how

[1:49:04] Hallelujah y'all understand what I'm
[1:49:07] saying I know he was more than a prophet
[1:49:11] toward a God but there's only one God

[1:50:01] your flesh
[1:50:02] I know what I'm talking about as you're
[1:50:04] six years
[1:50:07] let me move on just give me a there's
[1:50:09] another quote I want to bring I want you
[1:50:11] to understand
[1:50:12] that the message we didn't understand
[1:50:15] Paul talk about the mysteries of the
[1:50:17] Gentiles love never has it ever been
[1:50:20] known
[1:50:21] Jesus Christ
[1:50:23] wanting to come live can I say it like
[1:50:25] that did you put your circums up in a
[1:50:27] doghouse
[1:50:28] foreign
[1:50:57] [Music]
[1:51:35] no man taketh the plow
[1:51:37] person and look back
[1:51:40] the Bible said he ain't worth it
[1:51:44] that's what Pentecost is
[1:51:47] that God brought him out of
[1:51:49] denominations
[1:51:55] message people have done the same thing
[1:52:02] but Brothers they will never become a
[1:52:04] nominations
[1:52:16] I can't finish this but I'll finish it
[1:52:18] later on whenever it's ready this is not
[1:52:21] what I want
[1:52:23] but um
[1:52:26] let me read this because everybody knows
[1:52:28] this one Revelation
[1:52:30] 19. I'm gonna close on this there's more
[1:52:34] to it I'm going to continue on this yeah
[1:52:36] because I want to see the Holy Ghost
[1:52:38] because
[1:52:40] he said in that day you'll see me
[1:52:44] I want to see him in everybody
[1:52:47] but we gotta Focus we got to reform we
[1:52:50] gotta make this turn
[1:52:54] don't get me wrong people
[1:52:57] I would never tell you not to listen to
[1:53:01] the message
[1:53:02] you must listen
[1:53:06] it's a mandate you have to listen
[1:53:09] but if you listen to that message
[1:53:12] and you can't see you
[1:53:15] you better go listen it again
[1:53:18] is that right because when Jesus read
[1:53:21] the scriptures
[1:53:25] you must read the scriptures you must
[1:53:28] listen to the message
[1:53:35] foreign
[1:53:48] Revelation 19 10. versus this
[1:53:54] and I felt and I fell at his feet to
[1:53:56] worship Him
[1:53:59] and he said unto me maybe see thou do it
[1:54:03] not
[1:54:04] I am that fellow servant
[1:54:06] and of the breadwinn and of thy Brethren
[1:54:10] that have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:54:14] worship God adult you for the testimony
[1:54:18] of Jesus Christ
[1:54:19] is the spirit of promise now that is so
[1:54:24] plain you know brother Branham say John
[1:54:27] typed out the bride so we went into a
[1:54:30] period of time we we fell at his feet
[1:54:36] oh come on
[1:54:38] that angel is William Branham William
[1:54:42] Brenham
[1:54:43] we fell at his feet to worship him
[1:54:46] and he said do it now
[1:54:51] worship God
[1:54:55] it's the truth people yeah the
[1:54:58] scriptures
[1:55:03] but we need to do what get up
[1:55:06] and worship God
[1:55:11] amen we need to worship God there's no
[1:55:15] message like this but this message
[1:55:18] because it's a revelation of the words
