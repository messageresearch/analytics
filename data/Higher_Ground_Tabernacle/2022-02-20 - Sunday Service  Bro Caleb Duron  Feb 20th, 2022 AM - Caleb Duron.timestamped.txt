[9:10] chapter 12 verse 31
[9:14] it reads wherefore i say unto you all
[9:16] manner of sin and bless me shall uh and
[9:19] blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but
[9:22] the blasphemy
[9:23] blasphemy against the holy ghost shall
[9:26] not be forgiven unto men
[9:35] and whosoever speaketh the word against
[9:37] the son of man it shall be forgiven him

[9:41] ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[9:43] neither in this world neither in the
[9:46] world to come
[9:47] contrary

[10:03] by his fruits
[10:12] oh generation of vipers how can you
[10:14] being evil speak good things for out of
[10:16] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[10:18] speaketh
[10:27] a good man out of the good treasure of
[10:29] the heart bringeth forth good things and
[10:31] an evil man out of the evil treasure
[10:33] bringing forth evil things
[10:40] but i say unto you that every idle word
[10:42] that men shall speak they shall give
[10:44] account thereof in the day of judgment
[10:52] can we say amen to that
[10:53] man
