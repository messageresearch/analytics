TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] to worship you oh my soul re take your my king in what you may it be a sweet Sweet Sound in your let's bow a word of prayer father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being so good to us tonight thank you for all that you do for us truly you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves father there is no words to express our gratitude our love Lord God we pray that you forgive us of our sin cleanse us Lord in our spirit from everything that is not like you oh God give us strength oh God to completely overcome completely be in a place where you can use us to your glory have mercy upon us tonight let us press Lord into that Kingdom let us move forward let us move upward let us grow into the very image of Christ help us Jesus Lord Lord please lead us but you said you would oh God and I pray pray Lord God that the word of God tonight will be a blessing to The Souls of people in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we uh want to thank the Lord for all that he has done and uh I believe we we we finished up on part of of the the the uh first chapter and I just kind of want to give kind of little synopsis of what we we we mention um my thought is when we come to uh worship God we we need to know what we for I think that though we're not preaching on the seven Church ages uh but I kind of glean a few things from the Ephesus age just to see once again um the kind of battle that they had now we must understand as we said last week uh the Ephesus Church was a spiritual church they were not like uh the Corinthians uh Corinthians were very difficult to teach or to even preach to uh but because they always had something going on they were more on the carnal side than than any uh the two top churches in that day was Ephesus and Romans and Paul was able to teach some of the deeper things to them now we Ephesus amen is a how can I say it brother Alan said it parallels Joshua and if you understand Joshua you understand that they went to possess their inheritance and Ephesus is the same thing it teaches us of our inheritance what God has given unto us and I want you to understand it's given to me it's not earned it's it the price has been paid um but I feel like we have done exactly what the early churches done the churches before us let's just go to Leia uh Lea basically lost her first love just like Ephesus did and she went after the worldly things and we find out in the Book of Revelation she ends up as not even being the Church of God because basically she puts Jesus the word out and she becomes her own church um so that's the the thing that we must understand we as the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't have seven more Church ages to go this is it and we must accomplish within this church age everything that they accomplished in the previous ages uh one thing that we must always remember this has been the theme of William brandom's message Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever and if we hold that to be true we have to fight to keep that going and the reason why I say that it was not only that the Ephesus had eph the Ephesian church had a life uh but they had the power of God backing them they had signs they had wonders they had uh people being raised from the dead and all kinds of things like that and if the if the if the Alpha and the Omega is the same message or the same word we need to be seeing those kind of things um among us but but let me say it like this God can't do it until he till this message produces a mature church we we we we must come to that kind of maturity where God can trust us and as the prophet of God said the bride will know how or know what to do with the word amen so let's stand and and we'll read uh uh I'm going ask you all to read uh um let's start at the sixth verse of the first chapter and I have you just to read the sixth verse um anybody there yet you want to read it brother uh read the sixth verse and we'll take it all the way down let me see here just so my notes here just keep reading I tell you when you stop Earth amen that's good that's good so Lord let us pray father God we thank you once again oh God for the reading of your word we pray Lord God that you would bless us today bless us tonight oh God as we venture into your word only you can break the bread of life to us and give us a broader understanding of what we now have we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated no no no you oh your phone no words um one of the things that I I thought that I would mention here this morning uh tonight is that um you know we we know we're elect we know that we are elected we know God predestinated us and I think sometimes we we we fail to see the very purpose for this and this is to bring us into the very image and likeness of Goden now now we we know uh uh there are scriptures that vindicate election and predestination and it's important that we understand that because down the road when these trials comes when these tests comes you've got to know who you are and brother bandam said when the Bride of Jesus Christ come to know who she is she will become an invincible Army now I say these things too because remember I said on Wednesday um that God is has given us enough word and enough Authority and enough power till he wants to see what we're going to do with it to bring another illustration remember brother Brandon when he was down uh in Mexico and there was a little baby who had the cancer of the mouth and everything else and you know the thing was so terribly disformed by this tumor and everything else and here was brother bam he was waiting on God waiting for a vision waiting for or something and and and then God said to to to brother bam I'm waiting on you in other words you are in a position now that you shouldn't have to depend on me even though you do you understand what I'm trying to say no signs no no wonders taking the authority of the word and using it with authority without feelings without Vision without any kind of physical manifestation the word in itself is God and so when God gives us the word we must understand we must do as brother bandam you know God like I said he was that wave sheath so we must understand we we're now the scriptures and everything is being unfolded to us in even the way that God handled him because remember if he's a wave sheath God's the same yesterday today and forever if we're going to come to a mature State and like I said we always talking about the third pool and things like that but these things cannot be manifested in our lives until there is a certain amount of maturity that God must bring us to and we must understand he's already done the work right he's already done the work it's like okay I've given you a hammer and a nail get to work right I've given it to you the word I've given you the word and and the the the the the word must be brought by way of your mouth now how many of y'all believe that that Christ Christ lives in you all right so if Christ lives in you what extra anointing do you need right because remember brother brandom said the Holy Ghost is actually temporal it's a temporal gift that God has given us until we come into the full stature of Christ amen right so you say what do you mean brother you know in I don't want to get off too bad but over over in in the other dimension there will be no miracle mirales Miracles only happens here okay so let me vindicate this thing on predestination Isaiah 43 1-2 said but now thus Saye the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that forth thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine amen when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walth through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee amen and remember God has done it before we got witnesses so great a cloud of witnesses we're encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses we can go through the Old Testament and see how Jesus Christ have been faithful yesterday and he was a faithful yesterday he's faithful today these scriptures are not just for what we call the natural Israel these scriptures are for us the whole Bible is for us and so what do you mean when I say this you know I thought about what I heard in the Ephesus Church AG when brother said Ephesus lost their first love they lost the joy they lost the praise they they they he listen he I heard tonight he he literally literally said to be become formal is to become Catholic that's how that's how God looks at this we have to fight to keep the joy and the spirit of God in this church and it can't be Auto it can't be systematic it must be spontaneous it must be every individual this is this is how you know when you when people love God because they you see the Joy The Joy overflows them whether it be in church or whether it be on the outside on the street that's right so that sixth verse says to the praise of the glory of his what Grace amen wherein he have what made us accepted in the Beloved I love this because I think about the glory of Grace the glory of Grace right being accepted in the Beloved and you got to understand it's not something that just happened happen we were always in him am and The Devil Makes Us think we got to we got to work to to be accepted no no no you have already been accepted if you've been chosen and elected to see this message you are in the Beloved right and we you said what do you mean that to be chosen means to receive favor amen right well pleasing you you well pleasing oh Lord I want to please you you're already pleasing him by what Believing on him whom God has sent and a lot of time we work we work we work but the only like I said to you many times the only thing you must work at and that is receiving the Holy Ghost the Bible said you we must labor to enter into that rest but you understand once the rest come that's all you do amen you know yeah that's all you do you don't you don't you don't worry about nothing else it's already done you know it's kind of like um what what what Boaz said unto Ruth you just lay stay right here don't go nowhere I'll come back when I finish it he made her a promise she didn't have to do no more other than believe that he was going to return and do what he said he was going to do amen right so in whom seventh verse so in Jesus Christ is our well done I've been saying oh Lord I just want you to look at me and say Well done well he's already said Well Done in Jesus Christ is our well done it's not in our works people is in his Works what he has already done for us oh it's true I like oh Lord I how many Y how many of us you know we make so many mistakes sometimes we just feel like we we don't scratched ourself off off the off the chart somewhere but we forget that in him we are accepted in him not in our own works this is total Grace it really is it's total Grace and we worry about things that we shouldn't listen not one man the Bible says not one of us can change ourselves not one of us can add one cubit to the Statue amen Christ is the carpenter he's the master the Builder and what we need to learn how to do is do what go back to trust in him yes sir we need to go back to trust in him it's when you stop trusting him is when your joy diminish that's right Hallelujah true that's right in whom we have Redemption through his blood the seventh Earth the forgiveness of sin according to your Works no according to the riches of his grace I'm glad it's Gra had you he used that word riches that means he's got a lot it's plenty he won't run out of his grace he won't run out of his grace it's wonderful Amen to know and this is what I said that's why Paul said make your calling and election sure right by the word by the spirit the sealing of the Holy Ghost is when you know that you know that you know you sure i' I've met the measures I've been Justified I've been Sanctified I've got the holy ghost amen now he that begun the good work in you he is faithful to complete iten right so part let let let's go here the eighth verse is his grace wherein he have abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudent in other words he's poured himself out amen and that's what brother bandam he used that that scenario he said all that was in God he poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured it into the church amen so oh I don't know how to love well if you got God in you love is there amen and we know that we know that we know the greatest battle that we have to fight not only just in the mind it is in the mind but that battle is it wouldn't be there if Satan your flesh amen killing yourself is the ultimate goal so that God can live now for those who out on on on YouTube I'm not talking about physical death I'm talking about spiritually you dying to your will amen like Jesus said not my will Lord but thine be done that's what that means dying to your will and everybody has a will right as I said on Wednesday night which is so true the greatest battle is in your in your mind but if you cater to the negative thoughts in your mind if it they win in your mind that's the direction in which you're going to go throughout the day until you wake up like Samson say hey what's what's going on here and Shake Yourself right right so this is a constant battle a constant battle and if we look at at Joshua you see Joshua and them were always in a battle and even at times when they thought they were at rest here come the enemy or they had to go fight the enemy right and I said just the other day you know one of the smallest battles they had to fight there in in in in in in the new land was AI amen and so you understand that's exactly what we're fighting now amen AI amen that's true but our is artificial intelligence right but they had a country amen and listen when God told them to go up and kill them they didn't do it see it's always when God say do it when God tell you to cut this off or stop this you got to you got to do it if you don't guess what you got to wait till he return and every time you go to up to try to fight AI you going to lose the battle until Joshua the Holy Spirit tells you now is the time for your Victory right but listen in all of that they lost the battle they felt the shame and the pain so that's what happens to us in the Spirit When God says stop this and stop that and we don't then guess what happens we lose the battle and now we got to wait till God give us unction again amen but it's all a teaching period yes amen it's something that God teaches us and give us Grace he giv us Grace thank you Lord thank you Lord he gives us Grace right listen having made known the ninth verse having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purpose in himself now I would ask the question what was his purpose what was the mystery of his will that God would become man amen that's right and man would become God Amen that's the mystery behind everything that God would restore to man kind everything Adam lost that's right plus amen because remember Adam was just the god of the Earth but God has made the Bride of Jesus Christ the Queen of Heaven and the queen of Earth am see I love this message glad to see you back brother I've been praying for you I'm so happy to see you you're looking better God is good to us amen he knows what what we need so his mystery think about this it's hard for us to comprehend God in us the god that created everything if we could just keep our mindset like that there would never be one ounce of fear amen that could penetrate you true you know that's one thing that that Satan really don't have he wasn't created with fear there were demons now don't you see what I'm saying if he had fear he would be afraid yeah that's right but he's not afraid amen that's right demons are afraid but the devil is not and he'll come he's going to come back after a thousand more years and challenge God again yes sir that's right and if you look up in in job you see that Leviathan that old Dragon he was created without fear so that's the devil created without fear had he had fear he would have never done what he did and that's what his children out there says oh no fear I don't know a man I don't know a man I don't know a man that don't deal with fear but that's what they say now anyhow when we look at this we must understand by the grace of God that God comes to multiply himself and we're part of it hallelujah amen that 10th verse yes sir we find out that we we we we we we are now and and I brought that out that 10th verse you'll find out I think that's 41 in job in the 10th verse you find out that God comes alone and he brings brings us to a place that we must understand that the times have changed this is what gets me people who have been in the message all these years supposedly they still don't know that the times have change yes we're no longer though the seven Church ages that's what brother bam said every Church age overlaps each other but we are in what we call the bride a people say oh don't don't say that or we say the eth day no such thing as the Eighth Day brother brandom said the eighth day is the first day amen now I go with what the prophet says right so we look at this thing you say well what do you mean brother Brooks it also began the fullness of time cuz you got to know when that angel said time will be no more that means something had to stop am something stopped and something began and brother vam he said now we entering the fullness of time people say well in the fullness of time all of these things happen yes it does but the fullness of time is when everything ends and everything doesn't end at one time fullness of time is when everything comes to an end that's when that angel said time will be no more so therefore something it changed and now we're dealing with the fullness of time with listen look at look at this the our own country look at the world is not everything falling apart is not everything ending everything is being manifested yes and so if we never seen the days of Noah and all of that we see it now there's no new thing but at the same time we must understand if the opening of the seals If people could just see it I believe that he said it placed us back into the Garden of Eden before the fall amen now now look what what an inheritance is that amen that means God has not there is no sin that's being reconciled to you oh Lord amen because back in the beginning Adam did not sin before the fall amen he said and this is the grace that God has given to us Listen People how can you how can you believe not believe this when the word of God says you Justified as though you never sinned in the first place where that places you yeah back to the beginning right but if the devil can keep us from seeing where we are that's why we get all we don't even we don't Rejoice because we're not seeing the full picture amen of how free we really are we ought to come in here praising God all the time because of the victory that he's given unto us only mature Christians can see this amen yes sir like I said last week people want God to oh God would you please do this God and God says do it yourself amen I've given you the equipment do it yourself Moses don't cry to me do it yourself the man at bethesa take up your bed and walk I ain't carrying it for you and I'm not going to get you no help am amen hallelujah this is where God is saying if you really believe the word trust the word amen walk in the light that in the dispens of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things where in Christ so how you going to be gathered if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's in Christ Christ who is the anointing both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him are you in him yes sir amen absolutely remember I said to you uh not long ago how that uh uh uh though Jesus uh had a time period that he himself couldn't couldn't override when he went down in into the into hell uh you know he couldn't override he had I don't know whether he finished preaching or whether what happened but I know one thing he couldn't get up until the time appointed that's right cuz the scripture said as Joe as as as as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights amen so will the son of man be in the heart of the Earth right so where is Hell on Earth in the heart of the earth and that's what brother brandom said he said that core down there that we just think is a lava you know just volcanic he said that's where it's at God help us Jesus you think listen listen and and and and you know I read this last week you think cancer is something the Bible said there is coming a time when men will will rot right in their flesh and the buzzers will eat off their caucuses before they even die I heard on a on a little news clip yesterday or day before yesterday they've got such a bad case of flesh eating disease there in California right now amen that's right right now and brother bam basically said the only thing that listen let me read it but remember that that that horrible things was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the Seal of God hallelujah that's what we're striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike amen amen so we've got some things that are motivating us right it alter motivators Amen to make sure we get in before the death angel strikes you know what I mean the the the the Angel that's really uh uh uh got problem not problems that's coming to pour out the wrath of God you know I I I believe this and I said this other day remember I talked about how brother brandham went beyond the curtain of time and how those uh they said that we we're resting on that and that was in the message uh the adoption you know he saw us over there yes sir now a lot of people can't comprehend that but I can my my thing is I know I'm there amen I've received the word amen and I understand no matter how holy I try to live there's only one that was accepted and I'm accepted in him because how you know he gave me the Holy Ghost amen and like brother brand said that's God when God chooses you he gives you the Holy Ghost amen that all right and I believe with all my heart when the seals were open that began this the the the the the the the how can I say the dispensation of the fullness of time if you listen to uh to uh to uh the adoption you'll see brother R talks about that I believe that in in that message so we realize by the grace of God let's move on I want to move on I'm going just throw some quotes out at you because I want you to understand that this is where we we have gotten caught up again I can't miss this one but I'll let me let me read first this this this uh scripture John 3:15-16 that whosoever believeth in him him should not perish but have eternal life just think about that just just think about that scripture that whosoever believeth that means continue to believe in him should not perish but have eternal life now can God lie he can't lie for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish have everlasting life that's that's why Paul said when that which is perfect has come we put away all the childish things right all of the things that we thought had some significance to it it did in it in its place amen but we we took those things like speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing having gifts and being able to preach and being able to sing gospel we thought oh we got the Holy Ghost oh oh this is it but that's not it amen Hallelujah if you can't receive the word for your day sir then you don't have it amen that that's just it amen and that's what a lot of people don't understand well these people they they they they have gifts and all these things and people are getting healed oh Judas preach Judas preach and people would heal and delivered under his ministry just like it was all the other Apostles but Judas was a devil amen and that's what people don't understand it's election it's predestination and everybody can't hear this message and this is what need to give us joy not not not because we're looking down on them but to look look what God has done hallelujah look what God has done oh my and this is the kind of thing that the Ephesians were able to accept they knew what Paul was saying because you know Paul was a prophet in was the angel to that church and he knew they knew that the teachings that he taught the real true church y'all know at at the end of the day before Paul died a lot of them had backsliding and turned their backs on the truth but but for those that group amen you know that God had ordained to eternal life they stayed with the word amen amen listen brother Brandon in the message Ephesians Church 8 he said don't never look for big churches and big things amen when we get to this Pentecost a age you'll certainly see where they lost out the very Church lay of the seal means Rich need of nothing and naked and wretched and blind miserable and don't know it y see that's the point they don't know it they don't know because they have fallen into a system of worship and they think God is there is that right that's what brother Rand said about the Pentecostal Church you see what we a message no you're not message until you leave the Pentecostal experience and you understand what I mean by that I don't mean the experience of the Pentecostal the real Pentecostal but you don't if you don't you stuck in the system you're still the same that's that's what people don't understand you still the same because remember there were there was a couple of tribes that came out of Egypt crossed over into the promised land and went back and that's what happened in message you know why because they want the easy way amen they want to shout to dance and running and speaking and Tong all of that and all of that is good but now we come to fight amen that's right we come to a battle and you he said listen I've given you all of this land every bit of it is yours so no excuses every one of this is yours but you got to fight you got to fight the divine nature in you comes by Victory amen true and I'm not saying we shouldn't have a good time in the Lord but let us not get confused like brother B said don't jump no higher than you live that's it very Church Leia means Rich need of nothing naked wretched blind miserable and don't even know it don't know it they went off after like great listen they went off off after like great money and buildings and everything else what's happening in this assembly amen give us this day our daily bread but everybody want something big Lord help us Jesus help us Jesus I mean we we we're so far off these people they lived in dens and and they was persecuted and all of these things and they still held to Jesus you know I like get turned off and don't have enough food to get McDonald's or something we get upset and con you understand me bad bad bad when not that's not truth that's not the real th bread and God's looking for th bread Christians yes sir amen not potted plants the breads Hallelujah when the church has always been the offs score of the earth and here they were hated by all people cast out in alleys any any anywhere they can live remember Hebrews 11 and take the the six last six of or or eight verses of it he said they they wandered about in in desert and in and wearing sheep skins and goat skins and was destitute and Afflicted and tormented let me tell you something these people really had God yes you know why yes yes who and and the joy of the Lord was their strength that's right Hallelujah yes sir they the Bible said they knew that they were pilgrims and strangers sometime we want to just settle down and have this big something and that big something and it's a trick of the devil especially in this day and time right now give me Lord what I need cuz most of all I want to make Heaven it's all right your gift will make room for you but never let your gift become your idol those people there how will I Our Testimony let's see what it says those people there how will our testimonies stand up against theirs in the day of the Judgment see those people people in that day they didn't have much but they had a lot of God hallelujah right so we come to a place you say well what do you mean it's so important and this is why I think a lot of fundamental uh Christians have a greater revelation of what happened to Calvary than we do because they at least know they're free they're saved they say I'm saved and I'm free I don't have to work but they don't understand we work for God only because we love Goden not we don't try we're not trying to work our way to heaven we're already sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so our works before God is to show our appreciation to him for what he's already done he can't do no more and how often brother R says I can't heal you God healed you 2,000 years ago you got to accept your healing that's that's it he he can't no long no more I can't deliver you you he delivered you over 2,000 years ago but we must fight for deliverance we must fight for healing it's ours it's our promise and when God see that faith in us he has to respond he has no choice it's faith in God excuse me that moves him amen that right Isaiah 63 1-3 who is this that Cometh From Edom with dyed garments from boar this that is glorious in his apparel traveling in the greatness of his strength I that speaketh in righteousness mighty to save wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine press now if you take I believe that's still in Isa uh job 41 how that Dragon was had wine or how the color it would have been red you understand me because he mimics God everything that the Lord does he mimics God and and I'm G tell you something you're not going to see no dragon it's a spiritual thing that we're talking about now I don't I don't know why God describe him like that okay you don't get it that old serpent the dragon who is that that old beast in Book of Revelation it's a man but it's in the image of a man the spirit that dwells in him looks like that like a dragon amen the behavior of a dragon amen amen yeah Hallelujah right it's it's the truth and and when you say what do you mean brother Brooks you know uh this is what brother B was talking about uh he said all of those this is why he he preached the message uh Revelation a book of symbols I think that's the way you know book of Sims Revelation book because he showed that these are symbolic things that we must understand but have spiritual applications and when you read it even in the Old Testament that's exactly right let me ask you a question so you understand the symbolism of the Ark of the Covenant what was that it came in the form of a man when you saw Jesus Christ you saw the Ark of the Covenant amen wherefore art thou R and th Peril you're not going to see no Beast the woman that sits on seven heels is wrong the woman that carries the cup riding on the beast that's spiritual people she's the church wherefore art thou read in thy perable and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine fat I have troden Down The Wine Press alone and of the people there was none with me for I will tread them in my Ang let me ask you a question it this is this is metaphor pretty much right you understand what I mean by that I mean you didn't see Jesus treading no wine press no amen he was treading up Calvary amen that's right but there was no wine press but his blood you saw that and there was none to help him meaning that Smite the shepherd and all the Sheep were scattered he was there alone amen treading The Wine Press he said for I will tread them in my anger and trample them in my Fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garment and I will set will stain I will stain all my reignment thank you Lord I was thinking about that today and I said oh my God I can't EMB bom it the weight of the world was upon his shoulder I get tired with a book bag you understand me I can't imagine that now you and I know how there have been times you feel so weighted you don't even sometime know why but you feel burdened this can't be you that what you got can't even be compared to what he had the weight of the world Now understand this we're not talking about just you know 8030 we're not talking about just when he died we're talking about from the beginning to the end amen right it's I can't imagine it but if you can see yourself in one of those places somewhere positioned upon his shoulder that he carried you am he carried your sins he he did it all for you it must become personal or you'll never catch the revelation of who you are what he's given you what he's made you he made made you this you know Adam couldn't get up and says Lord why you made me a man he made you a man Adam he made you the god of the earth Adam all Adam could do was receive what God had already done for him amen and listen Adam still lives amen because the blood of a lamb was shed for him and Eve amen it doesn't take away nothing nothing can separate us from the love of God nothing Hallelujah listen Isaiah 53 3-6 it said he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief see it's so many people I think my wife was asking me a question about Calvary and the weight uh the pain of Calvary because brother Ram said no man on Earth could have done it Jesus was specially built to take the pain amen specially built to take the pain and you and I must understand even if we try to imagine it there's no way you can imagine it your worst pain in your that right that has ever racked your body cannot compare because I was told that there was a time there was no words such as excruciating but they could not Define or even touch what the pain level was that Jesus went through so they came up with a new word excruciating now y'all tell me what excruciating mean to you when you say excruciating you're basically saying this is the worst level of pain I've ever had to experience and then you get in something else and then it becomes excruciating it never stops am but Jesus pain no man can explain it there's no word in our vocabulary that can actually get give us an understanding and when you think of Hallelujah when you think about it he did it for me and he did it for you how can we be ashamed of him how can we be ashamed of him and we hid us our faces from him he was despised and he was and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our grief he carried our SS yet we did exem him stricken smitten of God in the Afflicted but this is what I love he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed now you see now you understand why God say if you don't forgive your brothers and your sisters neither will I forgive you cuz look what he had to go through and he did all of that for us all of that and you got to forgive he said if you don't forgive I can't forgive you now now we didn't have to do all we didn't go through all of this rejection from everybody and none of us was there to help him and all we have sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord have laid on him the iniquity of his of us all even the stuff we know when we doing wrong he has laid that on that was laid upon him now you got to understand that's why Paul says L listen this is this is this is this needs praise you need to praise God when you when you think about the glory and everything that he has given you praise himen don't be shy don't be shy you and I must understand that the sacrifice of Christ is for you this is the mercy and Grace that Christ has given to us given to us amen Proverbs 33-6 I had to throw these scriptures in there because I want you to see this Ephesians is packed and once you see the foundation where Paul is trying to bring the people to it should stir you up into a fa place where Lord I got to do this not that not that I have to do it but I want to do this amen yes sir let me run this race now Lord with with with with with with uh with patience and and and and love and let let me have the strength of God in Me that I might love my friends as well as my enemies amen amen listen what he says now I never saw a scripture like this before until I started studying Proverbs 3 3-6 it says let not mercy and Truth forsake thee in other words don't backslide bind them because if you forget what the mercies and the truth that God has given to you you going to backslide amen that's is it he said don't forget Calvary don't forget this is the mercy and Grace that I've given unto you don't forsake this amen bind them about thy neck write them upon the tables of thine heart in other words put them in a place that you can see them you can you know that they're there don't lose it amen see if you lose what he's done for Calvary you're going to lose your joy y amen you say oh brother I'm I'm not but see what I'm saying is this is what we do we lose Satan is he's a serpent he's a Slicker he's a snake he's a dragon and that old Dragon will woo you to sleep he'll make you comfortable and we don't need to be comfortable we need to be on fire for God that's right Hallelujah and that's what he does he makes us so comfortable we come to church comfortable seats whatever the case may be air condition whatever the case and Lord have mercy you put us and compare us to the Ephesus Church my God my God have mercy on us Jesus Christ the same yesterday today andever that's why brother random said there going to be a few that I move out of this age because the devil has been wise had 2,000 years to figure it out he knows how to do it and he knows people love religion he seen that throughout the ages and he know how easy it is to get men to worship themselves or worship something else he know idolatry and in and what we don't understand how I never saw it like I did before today you know how how how to be you know uh formal starchy it's BAS the Catholicism yes it you've left your first love but we're coming church and because we're so conditioned of saying it this way and doing it this way people come and you know you can't help but be late sometime but when you come late all the time something wrong with that you know if you don't without an excuse some people have work in you know I'm not talking about that I'm talking about people who have no excuse they wait till whatever time like today I was just a little bit late I I told my brother I said I got to start coming here even on this night a half hour early I don't like just rushing in no even though I've been studying looking at the word I I just didn't I I I I don't like it listen let's move on I'm sorry so shall thy faith find listen let me read this write them upon the table of thy heart so fourth verse shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God God and man trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path Lord how I'm going to make it how I'm going to make it up the statue Lord trust not lean not into your own understanding amen trust the Lord right with all your heart lean out to your own understanding and he will what direct your path Amen in all your ways acknowledge Him every bit when you wake up every bit something come something new something you have a question acknowledge Him and say Lord which direction you want me to go with this and he will direct your path Hallelujah 12th verse that we shall be to the praise of his glory who first what trusted in him we got to stop there cuz it it goes it gets better as I say it gets good and and that you know because you trust in him how can you not have joy and peace amen amen Satan going to come you can't say oh don't let the devil come no he's coming he has been ordained just like you have he's been ordained to give you trouble that's just all to it there's no way of getting around it you think Jesus could get couldn't get around it and you going to get around it no it's got to happen let's stand I hope this is not too slow for you and when I say that I'm trying to cover cover this chapter and it's been what how many weeks now but nevertheless I don't want to move through it too fast I really want everybody to see how important it is to remember like I said that bride who made it who was marching to the tune of the word she had the cross of Calvary in front of her that that's what what kept her in in in in line she remembered she didn't she didn't forget her mercy she didn't forget her grace she understood she was there because of Calvary and if if you get if you go if you get that you think well I've been good in church and I did this in church and I did that in church that ain't it it's it's Christ in you the hope of glory let's have a word father God we thank you for tonight's service we pray that you continue to bless us and give us understanding Lord I have just been enjoying you and enjoying this word I've had my battles today but I thank you for giving me the victory Lord we thank thank you for all that you do for us and we thank you for this night and your presence that I feel in this little lesson thank you sir thank you Lord for coming by we know Lord that you keep all your appointments and we do thank you Father God Bless the people of God here bless us Lord and we'll take this word plant it deep in our heart and water it with thank you Jesus water it with praise the Lord water it by praising you that's how brother bam said once the word is give we ought to praise him that's the watering of the word thank you Jesus for all that you do in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen dismissed
