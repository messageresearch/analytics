that song I envisioned I look right at it amen amen the prophet of God said you got to see it before you see it that's right hey by the grace of God we appreciate the Lord still looking for our keys I'm sure they're somewhere they're called to me in a bit I have no idea we really don't but you know the Lord knows where they are how he's found them before me for me before and I know he'll do it again not prolonging the time that was such a wonderful song thank you brother we just get right into the word of the Lord I want to start with second Peter the first chapter we're not going to break these things these are virtues down but I keep preaching on these because I really want everybody to really dig into that and ask God for the revelation of the hour what we need to do to make a rapture I believe that when we seek God in this manner we are seeking Him according to his perfect will and when you when you in the perfect will of God you can't help but to be blessed I just know that we're living in the last days the enemy is fighting everybody on him you know just amazing what what's happening as I said earlier even this morning if we really think that we're in a battle just hold fast cus you know we're just we're just dealing with the footman right now we are your weight to the horses and the chariots come but you know there's nothing that we have to fear because we trust the law I mean think about the thousands upon thousands of people that Israel had to fight and yet they won the battle with the handful because the Lord fought the battle for them and when I see God fighting the battle for Israel it's as well as wicked as they could be at times I gives me a little hope I know the God the Lord Jesus loved me and you know that's one of the things that I I know not that I I just love him but he loves me he has proven himself to me and I say it like that not just for me but for all y'all we should know by now that the Lord loves you if he had passed judgment on us we wouldn't be here today but thank God for His grace and His mercy as we stand let us turn there second Peter the first chapter and we're just going to read the second verse to the tenth first Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain I understand that word given not will give has given it it's already done given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside excuse beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance temperance patience and patient but early kindness excuse me a patience garland excuse me and godly brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that was forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make yourself your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ here's Peter talking about these things and he says I love that car where it says here an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly not sparingly or scarcely but abundantly and that's exactly what God has done let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being good to us there are no words to express our gratitude as we stand in your podium your holy place today I stand in all a little fella like myself Lord not even worthy to call upon your name but your grace has found me and placed me in this position and father as we stand here in your stead we pray Lord God this evening that you would speak to us Lord sanctify us holy let the fire of God come through our lips Lord and and burn everything unbelief whatever is not not of you out of us Lord that you may be glorified may your Holy Spirit Lord just in campus over floors Lord as David said let my cup my cup runneth over oh God and I just pray Lord that you are glorified tonight and that you have will receive our offering and our sacrifice is Lord tonight to your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we were talking this morning of speaking this morning uh I I if we No if we could see the seals and what brother madam said about the four horse riders you got to understand when Paul said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high places to give you a better understanding on what we are working with brother Bentham tells us by God's grace that every time Satan would dispatch one of his warriors or his spirits to come back or come against the church God would always release one of his and we know when the Antichrist spirit was released amen in during the time of the emphasis age we know that God did a thing and he brought forth Paul who represented the lion and we understand by God's grace it was a battle between Antichrist spirit and a lion now understand Paul was not just a reformer but Paul was also a prophet so therefore God had at the beginning had to release a prophet that could see this Antichrist spirit because had not Paul identified it I don't really believe all of the others would have seen it as clearly remind you Paul was the messenger of the Ephesus age so as we listen to brother Branham these people listen to brother Paul because they realized that Paul had a special anointing on him and Paul basically wrote according it to historians and I believe it almost all of the New Testament and so we know that Paul the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet according to Amos 3:7 so you and I realized by God's grace that God dispatched this knowing thing where Paul his letters were telling the people to beware that when he would leave off the scene false prophets and and everything would come on the scene and how the Antichrist spirit would come posing as the Spirit of Christ and Paul exalt the people he said whatever you do you contend for the faith that means you've got to fight Amen to keep it alive and so we realize they meant that after this Antichrist spirit introduced the deed of the Nicolaitans that deed became a doctrine and all of a sudden when it became a doctrine it also became a murderer it began to in Smyrna I began to persecute all a men who disagreed with their teachings and so you realized amen all of this was based upon jealousy let's go back to Lucifer even in the beginning he was jealous of Micah and he was jealous of God it all jealousy and when you find a Christian that just don't like you and have no reason not to like you it's always jealousy it is a spirit of Antichrist it's not Christ that makes you behave yourself like that so and the Bible tells us that spirit of jealousy will also became a murderer right it will kill you if it's not with your words it would kill you physically so this Antichrist spirit has been running for a long time now it has been sealed up it had been sealed up nobody understood it and nobody knew what it was all about throughout all history from Genesis all the way up it was sealed up and you know brother Branham tells us that every he said from Genesis all the way up you can see the church ages every every every stage had at church ages and they had the same spirits they had the war against but they never knew what it was and so when when when the devil tried to come to the word and and I think about how now here it is the devil came to Eve and he talked to her he teaches her he's the Antichrist he's against the word he gets her to believe it it becomes a doctrine is that right they've performed this word they did what the doctrines they do and what did they bring forth death right and so now we find out they try this doctrine as I said well I'll cause you to produce something just like the word causes you to produce something the word causes you to produce life and and and and and the Antichrist causes you to produce a false doctrine right a false covering a false religion and so when Christ I love this because remember when when Luther came on the scene he was the intellectual he was the smart guy and he was able to see something different that it wasn't my works because remember amen the doctrine that gate that Adam and Eve received from this false Antichrist spirit produced works they thought that they could save themselves so they put a religion around them right but then here come God comes along like a man with the intelligence and says where are you Adam where are you and then he goes on and says now who told you you were naked right so at that time Adam and Eve that you know because we remember when that Devil came to them and gave them the word of a false word the Bible said when they did what he said then their eyes were open you see it was a false revelation it was a false understanding of the word but the box is now their eyes were open yes open to good and evil now they know they dealing with not only Christ but I Anti Christ but watch Christ comes along and he identifies them and he says who told you you see where it goes it now know this whole scene comes right back to the devil the serpent the devil told me so now and then you see the seals you see the you see they did the very word of God combating and man and then what did God do the same thing he did in this day we would not have seen the Antichrist spirit as closely as we see it now because we all were clothed with religion we all had our garments spotted we all were what would you say some Baptist Methodist Presbyterian whatever it was our figleaves but we had a prophet like jesus said unto adam and eve you got nothing this stuff that you got won't work it's not acceptable bow before God you need some blood and what did Jesus do amen did y'all know that the voice that walked in the cool of the evening was Christ and he comes along and he gives them a coat a lambskin with blood right now here over here they think that will be accepted because they were able to build religion and and it looks beautiful like Cain he had everything lined up in a row you know requires everything looked beautiful and they thought that it would be accepted but the only thing even in the beginning that was accepted is the blood of Jesus Christ and Luther found the key and said the just shall live by faith right it didn't stop the persecution it did not stop the false vine for growing it kept on growing and you and I know that what happened what which is what happening right now many boys and girls are finding other how can I say it just like they did in the days of Noah the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took upon them wives they didn't marry them and what did they do produce Giants and it was a plot in a scheme of the mother church to get her daughters to marry the sons of God what was it it was to make more of them y'all know that to be true so we realized amen what did it do it produced Giants now these Giants remember they always every time brother Branham referred to Giants is always intellectual Giants so you know now we're not a dealing with Goliath as far as a statue we're dealing with Goliath as intelligence amen to out with the devil you must know and have a revelation from the Lord right you listen that's what the prophets said when the bride of Jesus Christ come to identify the two spirits that works within the framework of church amen she will become an invincible army there is only two spirits in the framework of the church and that is Christ and the Antichrist and the Antichrist will always make you feel religious God don't want religious he want to see the blood when I see the Blood I will pass over you and it always always remember Amen that what happened was is that remember after Cain went out and started his organization and everything else ah you know who he started you know the front one of the first thing they did they they got into beautiful women read your Bible women weren't even mentioned until Cain see stop producing these beautiful women and it was all in the scheme of the devil down the road he knew that these beautiful women will become the sons of God saw wives right and remember the prophet of God said he said that when they went out and did that he said God never forgave them and you can preach this to your children all day long if God don't give them any ideas to hear and eyes to see they're gonna do it anyway you and I cannot say one of our children we can't say one we can't even save ourselves God is the savior salvation belongs to the Lord is that right and if God choose to give you a esau gain glory be to God what they were going to say Lord how come you give me a Jacob and Esau God does what he wants to do all we can do is have faith and believe for them but at the end of the day God knows them that are here so you and I must understand by God's grace amen there is a characteristic we I get more and more and more and more excited about what God has done and it's sitting right under our nose all God is saying in order for this cake to work follow the recipe right none of us can add one cubit to our statue but when we submit that is the key submit to the word and I'm gonna tell you something to release evil is painful especially if it's an evil that you love and people don't want to admit that they might still have some love for worldly things but God would challenge you but God never challenged you without giving you a reward when you overcome is that right oh yes he knows what you like he knows what you are addicted to and he tells you overcome it and what is it about that is that you and I must know that God will work with your will till you can't go - Lord - Lord Lord you know I really don't like doing it then you continually do it you lying to yourself hallelujah what you need to do is as Lord I enjoyed this my flesh enjoy this but your words sense and man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and my lord I am submitting myself as Christ submitted himself in the garden not my will but let thy will be done crucify me whatever it takes to produce the will of God is what we ought to be willing to do don't even think is gonna be easy not on you because of your will we have a strong will you know our worst enemy is our wheel but God knows of you surrender that you surrender in your being you surrender yourself to him and that's what God wants he wants submission is that right he tests the cane on his will he gave Cain an option tested came on his will and came refused to submit his will to God's will and there he was therefore he was outcast that's the serpent they know to do right yet they don't do it is that the truth did you know even I've said this before it blows my mind if I could say like that forgive me for slaying Lord but let me say it like this it really shakes me when I know that the Pharisees in inherit and all of them knew he was a messiah yet it was there where they didn't want to lose their kingdom they didn't want to lose their position in society can you imagine them being in hell and the demons are tormenting them all you thought you was a high priest oh you thought you was a king enjoy your kingdom let atonement what atonement admit they had Jesus right in position they had a place to be saved and they walked away from it right now you and I we have a place to make a rapture I believe every one of us in here saying I believe we have given our hearts and life to the Lord but we're talking about rapturing material Noah Noah's are saved but Enoch was raptured with all my rapture material and when Rattray material are those who will walk with God so a Lord how could I walk with God God and His Word is one and he's given us a word of the hour hallelujah and he's all but I can't perform it if you just believe it if you love it so much that you want to do it hallelujah if you never come to that place where you see you're doing it God will measure it up as a whole because if you have a willing mind that's what the Bible says a willing mind to do it right God will accept it but we must be aware of the Antichrist the Antichrist comes in so many variations he he's a smart character you better believe he years and he'll come along and he'll come and here take your worship away and people that sit there don't even know that they're being influenced by the Antichrist because the prophet of God said wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise and we'll come in and you know the devil said well you know you don't feel like worshiping you don't even feel like raising your head you know the song leaders ain't singing the song I won't hear on them they're saying we'll do that we'll go through these mind battles and not even know you wouldn't even have a battle if the Lucifer wasn't there if the devil wasn't there to talk to you you wouldn't have a mind battle you would come right in here in worship God but whenever you find something resisting you worshiping God thank for a moment who is this it is the devil and they will he said now don't you worship God ain't nobody else in here worshiping who cares I'm like the woman at Jesus feet nobody in Simon's house was worship it but I came to worship see that's what we must understand I don't care nobody else's hallelujah praising God and thank you Jesus because I realize I'm working against an antichrist spirit that do not want me to worship God why wouldn't he want you to worship God because the Bible says in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy he does not he don't want you to have that joy and the Bible says it is the anointing that destroy the yokes if you get Jesus on the scene he can break your yokes whatever your problems are God will solve them but you need an anointing do to do that not just the word we've had the word brother branham when he came on the scene he just didn't have the word he the anointing he had the anointing of the word it wasn't the man who was the anointing that destroyed the yokes then we supposed to have a double portion that's something you gotta jump up and down all the time but you come into worship you come into worship you know you don't come in to say well I wonder wonder wonder what he's going to preach I need something deep today yacht you need is something to live you come to hear the word to live you can't forget about how deep it is when the word comes you all to say am i living that because God knows the menu he knows exactly what you feed you look at all the deep things that have been said and done and people still can't live it I want to live it if I don't know nothing but my ABCs let me live ABC y'all understand me it ain't about all huh see God chose us because we were kind of dumb on this you know me look dumb animals you know we should see Papa do you we don't we don't do nothing we depend on his leadership we depend on his guidance we I do I depend on him that's how the Antichrist comes in Antichrist puffs you up the Antichrist try to make you feel like you better or something greater you're not we ain't nothing hallelujah Paul tried to explain and he said everything I ever learned everything I thought I knew I count it down all I'm interested in now is knowing Christ in the power of his resurrection I want to know the excellency of his power I want to excel in it somebody I don't want to just sit here as a nominal Christian we've got to move on up hallelujah with the authority and the power of the word and when the devil comes to shake your kingdom you ought to say devil this keeneland cannot be moved it cannot be moved hallelujah you said what do you say the word says this kingdom cannot be Moo listen first Peter 4:16 says yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf hallelujah when somebody are you holier than thou and they want to persecute you because you are Christian you're not supposed to drop your head in shame hallelujah say you oh you know what we need to do start doing the truth you know I don't know what you call them steps but anyways shuffle a little bit I saw I saw video of the Jewish people how they celebrate this new this are the eighth day I've got to call it I can pronounce the word and they doing just like we do I look at them and they're doing all this ok that's where it come from I said oh Lord this is wonderful a man the only thing they do we don't do we don't get it well yes we do we do it their ego Maj but you know you look and you see that the worship is basically the same God when the Holy Spirit is among you it will cause you to act the saying do the same and the Bible says Emma for the time has come the judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first beginning us what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel of God you know what what people don't understand is that even at the judgment they're going to be so judged by the Queen of the South God working with women and women is a high trophy for God because they were deceived and brother ben said if a woman overcoming this age she gets twice as much as a man and guess what then God comes along and takes the Queen of the South and sets her there to judge a woman becomes a judge in the kingdom of God hello you say that maybe then who will you you liken unto a woman but the Bible said the Queen of the South will judge all these people who say they live too far and they could not make it to church when Queen of Sheba traveled throughout the devil desert hallelujah Amen pending dangerous when when she got the church guess what folks she did not fall asleep I know we get tired don't get me wrong I'm not talking about the faithful I hate to talk about that but some people come to church and they literally mark their chair at least it seems that way but nevertheless my point is she made it I don't know how tired she was but she learned I don't know how tired she was but she kept her enemy made you do that see you sir and why weak amen enough amen to understand that this man Solomon was not an ordinary man uh-huh and let me tell you something there's so many people in this message still believe that brother Branham was just an ordinary man he was more than a man if you handle him like our ordinary man you gonna look for mistakes that all but he was ordained of God anointed of God and the very words that God wanted us to hear in this generation he spoke them oh I almost late leap now but I'm you know that sealing but nevertheless you and I must understand it must be perfect hmm it must be in order to go to heaven you must be perfect is that right the Bible said be perfect but wait for your father which is in heaven is perfect how are you going to be perfect you can't do it you don't have the means to do it as the Prophet God said we were born failures but there is a Holy Ghost there is a way and the Prophet God said if God require you to be her perfect he must make a way for you to be perfect that's what Calvary was all about that's what the blood is all about and now we realize he meant that we're fishing on the bloody bleeding Word of God and what is happening we are now partakers of God's divine nature is that the truth you say although I have love yes you have love you came even have faith without love and when you have faith is because God has dropped his love into your heart and that love you see it gotta be the same half an Omega must be the same love in the foundation and love as the capstone is that right that's what the Bible says this same stone God has made that once was the caller has become what the head of the corner right so it bends God so loved the world right that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish so you've gotta have love in order to have faith because out of love come faith virtue knowledge temperance and then at the end of the road God crowns it oh yeah he crowns that love it must be that way the seed of God is love is that the truth so if the seed of God is love it's just like any plant it grows up out of the ground it doesn't look like the same thing act a little seed it breaks opening a little stem grows up it doesn't like the seed it grows up with the leaves and the tassels and everything else but the life that was in that seed is in all those stages of growth and at the end of it the revealing of what it is what quit was placed in the ground is now will will be revealed at the maturing of the plant am I making sense so love had to be put in the seat it was a seed of love and when it was quick and that's why when you first got saved and gave your heart to the Lord you felt like you could love everything the butterflies were beautiful the birds sang beautiful everything saying why it was love but didn't love produce faith say produce aren't you furniture produce knowledge all the way up to brotherly kindness its maturing it's coming back to the original seed it's coming back to the thing that it was when it went down in the ground is that right and then at the end of the day you are totally loved full of it but now you've been living seed the Living Word manifesting everything that Christ is that right because Jesus Christ was the very seed of God whoo come on somebody see and that's that's where the Satan comes he brings in division Eve among the message people and they don't even see it well if you don't belong to my little message church then you ain't really a brother you understand what I'm trying to say people have they don't say it but they have this little spirit behind them and they don't even know where she I go to this brother's church and he's deep you know I'm saying I'm the old God deep deep there's nobody greater no deeper than Jesus could ever be jesus said love thy neighbor as thyself that's deep that's what you call deep now that's deep how'd you gonna love your neighbor as yourself but that's what Jesus said you must do hey man let me read that Matthew 5 38 48 he says you have heard that it had been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth but I said to you that ye resist not evil no but whatsoever show but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also people have never figured that out yet they've tried to say does he mean that symbolically does he really mean that he means exactly what he said somebody slap you in the face you do what you talk I see what I'm trying to say that's real love did not Jesus do it they smoked him in the face they spit in his face and at the end of the day he still say Father forgive them for they know not what they do he did not see the people himself he saw the enemy in which he was working with and you and I must start seeing the devil and not our brothers and our sisters right listen he goes on to say but I say unto you that ye resist not evil right don't resist it oh come on Lord I'm talking about the statue of a perfect man if Jesus ordered these things were not so supposed to resist evil I'm gonna let you walk all over me like that you think I'm a fool no you know how we talked or used to talk and my thing if we don't talk if we think it you know you must think I'm crazy just let you walk all over me right he said don't resist and you will cheat on what we don't see is that when we don't resist when we do what he says it's a growth like I told you growth is when you can it not it doesn't come in times they're easy as when you're challenged mmm Peter didn't fight oh no you're not gonna crucify me uh he didn't go through all of that Peter went on right to it and says hey let me tell you something I'm not worthy to be crucified like my lord haha crowd turned me upside down he did not resist the evil Christians we all need help we need some more growing and it's okay but this is what the word comes it comes to show us where we are so that we could better prepare remember I read the quote last week how it was through sweetness and meekness to me that that was just that was an atomic bomb in itself to know that I can whip the devil with sweetness and meekness that's what confuses him when he comes at you and all the sweetness and meekness he does either huh no that's too much love for me ah he can't handle it and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away that coat let him have that cloak also that's a big one whosoever it's the word the word and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain that's a word that's a big one give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away woo I want you to hear what I'm saying what the Lord is saying see you have heard that had been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate the enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that witch's Paislee use use you and persecute you oh that's that's when you're not resisting well I say Lord send down the fire no that's not what we're doing it must be perfect we must be the exact example and reflection of Jesus Christ himself right listen that ye may be children of your father he said to all of this that you may be children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust and if you love them which love you what reward have ye he said if you love your enemy there's a reward for it do not even the public's the same and if you should loot your brethren only what do you do more what ye more than others do not even the publicans so but be eat but be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect he basically said when you allow yourself to come to need let me tell y'all something now I really believe maybe I'm wrong but when the squeeze come these scriptures what I just read will come I will come alive because what did he tell it Peter Peter that's not the sword I want you to fight with if you fight fight with the fork sword you will die by the sword right this is not and what did Jesus do to show what he meant by it he took the man here put it back on him and he undid what Peter did took away the evidence so Peter couldn't get locked up you understand me and so what did he do he often in an hour of violence he brought peace that's Christianity it must be perfect help us Jesus I want to be that way it's all my heart I want to be just like that to me that's awesome to me that what a real that's what a real that's what a real Christian is a one who can withstand and withstand evil become the very standard no matter what Satan does he stands and and you know like the Prophet God's saying having that undisturbed faith but this come by prayer Romans 12 he says listen I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God and I read that this morning that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and faithful how many acceptable and perfect will of God there it is again God must renew our minds he must change us remember I told you that Antichrist spirit will always lift you up and make you feel like your Lord and what you really are and us preachers we have to be careful we don't mind you said oh that's good I thank the Lord for you but if you're not careful amen that spirit will lift you when it comes to singers it's the same way oh you are nobody keeps saying like you all of that's good but if a person is not prayed up in a spiritual mind that Antichrist spirit will make you think you're something you know is that right but I Lucifer thought he was something God made him the most beautiful angel up there and he just thought he was number woman and all of that and look what it did what all of his children it's the same way you got to understand we're living in the age of Lucifer and all of his children is thinking about iPhones and I this and I said you know it's all I write and it's significance of something brothers and sisters you know because it's not a I it's him it all about him it's nothing about us all this that we do go for the glory of God and him only you love the Lord understand that these four beasts that I would go back to that understand of the four beasts that was right and became a pale horse it came into a place Amen that it began to arrive throughout all the ages right now watch this because this thing is coming alive again right now right now laws are in place and they can't just kill you and persecute you but don't forget the Beast is in its place and once all these laws are changed because remember the Bible tells us that he's going to change all the laws and the laws will be changed persecution will come on all who reject the Council of Churches and everything that's part of it what is that the manifestation of King the manifestation of Judas all of Satan's evil forces will come against what we call the bride brother Branham said it was those demons out of the river of Euphrates amen and he said when those you nervous of you came up though when that bottom that pit was open he said what happened those demons came out and it anointed who Hitler Mussolini right and Stalin and look at the gruesome things that they did to those Jews and it's coming again and he said when they love Hitler they came to the west coast and they occupy Hollywood that's why you see all the wicked stuff of Hollywood hell coming up out of Hollywood all of the perverse things and everything else comes out of Hollywood even your president comes out of Hollywood and let me tell you something people of God he might look like a Cyrus to you but let me say it like this at the end of the day he has come to do the work of Satan you might not agree with me but you're gonna see because no good thing comes from there don't get me wrong he did you know what what I'm trying to say Nebuchadnezzar was anointed - he was a real vessel of God he did what God wanted him to do but he was not a vessel of Honor Moses and Pharaoh Pharaoh did everything God wanted him to do release the children and everything else but he was not a vessel of honor right now we're dealing with Christ and Antichrist hmm and understand how president vowed himself to the Catholic Church so what you're gonna say about that so you and I must understand thank God for all the good things he's doing but don't get your eyes don't get mixed up he's come and he's beautiful it's a tool to help God drive us to our knees please slow for people God requires perfection we want to bear that in mind that there is nothing just Padraig talking can go in the presence of God nothing part way it must be perfect I worship everything hmm now in the god of eating God had Adam and Eve in the garden and they sinned and transgressed the laws of God by sinning disobedience and when transgression comes disobedience is the transgression of the law and the law of God him being holy just unadulterated holy therefore no spots of hardened holiness can ever stand in his presence so if sin came in the world by transgression then sin must be dealt with before the sinner can ever stand in the presence of God now there is no law there is no justice but law requires or justice requires a law and law when it is called on it projects justice now by the law no flesh is saved now that's the law cannot save us the law was just the thing that put us in jail but it was no redeeming power the law only showed us that we were sinners and condemned us that's what law is to do it brings condemnation or to show you you were mistake is so the law in itself could not say it could only persecute and God being holy and just he had to have a persecution he had to persecute the sinner because he had overstepped the boundaries of grace and had become a law breaking citizen then he must be dealt with and every law has a penalty for the penalty of transgressions God's law is death and it had to project death to turn the human race and all of the human race is under the penalty of this law and now when Adam and Eve have sinned and there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with and no man can commit a sin of any type no matter how little or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of the holy God come on somebody there's got to be somebody with the spirit of Hitler on them in our day and Hitler's idea was to make the Germans great again and the things that are being done now I'm speaking spiritually and the things that are being done now are the same things that were being done in Hitler's day there were some people wise enough to escape but I want you to know Hitler had a joint a covenant with the Catholic Church - I saw it on YouTube with a man say he's gonna be lawyer to them hello somebody so I'm just trying to tell you I'm bringing out spirits not people I'm letting you know what we're dealing with I've got German friends who didn't even know what Hitler had done to the wall was over because we're dealing with spirits and you and I must understand that brother Branham did not tell us that those spirits of the euphrates came to America for us to have a little knowledge they came to do a work and they come to do what brother Brennan said they were loosed on the bride they come to attack us and the saddest part about it when they think they got us we're going yeah amen ah it'll be the foolish virgins who would get the wrath of this generation that God would pour out his wrath - it won't be us Jesus escaped it Moses escaped it and so were we and when Adam and Eve had sinned there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with no man can commit a sin of any type no matter how little or how big that individual sin had to be dealt with before the one who committed it could ever stand in the presence of holy God now you got to understand the bow said if you have broken a lot of the commandments you have done them all unbelief every sin there is and there is no way that you can sit there and tell anybody there is no I'd never do that yeah-huh the only way that you'll never do it is God keep you cuz he's the keeper of the soul but I tell you what you said you might not willfully do it but there are times people have had guns in place today it and somehow they will changed y'all understand me the only person that can keep you is God so therefore when Adam and Eve had sinned and had transgressed the law they were subject subject to death and the law had to execute had to be executed therefore it put the human race under the penalty of death now if we could only settle down for a few moments now you said I want to be I'm going back to the horse riders Satan comes to steal kill and destroy and that's exactly what happens when you see a church a church is a mother and she's supposed to be giving out life not death she's not the kill or steal but she's here to give people life that they may have it more abundantly she is Jesus Christ on earth today but look at the churches what are they doing they stealing from the people they're spiritually killing the people and destroying them selling their souls straight to hell but the New Jerusalem she is the mother of all living that's what this message come to do not to run people away not to make them feel indifferent not to Amen criticize them remember we came here to bring them life and if we're not giving life to the people amen we are missing the whole calling of what we're here to do mr. truth it is the Antichrist that brings death and this church is supposed to bring life that's why you and I must it meant climb the ladder that God has for us it is the only way we'll bring life if he is the fountain of life and we put took up that life we've become the fountain of life he said out of you out of your belly with flow rivers of living water where are the waters am I making sense I just want to say by the grace of God the Israelites just discovered this this new they just had a real red heifer boiling and y'all know about the red heifer I love it I love it I love it amen because I who just preached on that somebody here anyway I heard it somewhere but anyway I knew that message I've seen it but I been talking about the red heifer but the red heifer is what it is it is a female cow it's not a bull it's a heifer but how does a red heifer Amen types out Christ that red represents the blood is that right all right but why are you saying brother when I'm saying she was there when he went the cavalry she was there when he was struck when he got a lickin she was licking tushy but the Bible said I tread the winepress alone he says I but she was a part of the I see it wasn't Adams it was Adam and Eve was in Adam her name was Adam she was a part of him he was a part of her it was when God separated her she was to be weaker vessel but now she becomes him by way of Union hallelujah and she was bad that's why the prophet god said every victory Jesus Christ won you won Ventoux you were there that's why we will eat we the ones that were selected it meant for Atlantis here because we were there we were there Calvary and now amen this red heifer is a very significant part of the Jewish religion because he is also a sign of the returning of the Messiah until this bride get covered with blood I don't mean beaten blood I mean blood the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah understand me so you said what do you mean brother remember I preach not long ago when David amen wanted the Zion the Bible said nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion the city same is the City of David did you know that Jerusalem Amen in Bethlehem all of them you know when when it came to them Jerusalem you know it uh it was it was it was it was it was it was occupied by the Japanese eyes did I preach that here I'm a preacher of the game if I hadn't but the jab you sites they were the offspring of giants and and in in this land where Jerusalem they also had a great valley and that valley was basically called the valley of death and in the way the Spain was set up the Jews ice a men are occupied the city that David wanted and he told who said he said whosoever whatever man that goes in and killed all of them even the lame and the blind the Bible said that David hated the lame in the blinds and his soul hated the daemon the blind but how can that be it's because it was a jab you sites that calls the lameness and the blindness so let's take it spiritually David wanted Jerusalem and you and I are Jerusalem but in the city of Jerusalem there not being a blind there not be any Lane let's take it all the way back what causes the blind and the lame the very Antichrist spirit that tewi is the cause of every blind in lane person and these giants let's go to the joins these Giants are intellectual Giants in the message that literally takes some of the quotes that brother Branham quoted and being what blind the people through their intelligence takes that very coat a man you know the hope out the Holy Ghost without sensation but they don't tell you about the life that you got to live how can you have the Holy Ghost ray if it doesn't have any sensation and you can't live it you still ain't got it give me the Holy Ghost with sensation if I got the life I don't mind without it without sensation and I live it that's all is about but now we find out that people what did the devil do to his shrewdness he brought death he brought a doctrine and now the people are naked again because you're naked if you're not clothed with the righteousness of God if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are still naked and David said kill them all second Samuel v 7 through 10 kill them all the men who captured the city I said Lord show me more he said in that New Jerusalem there'll be nothing that will defile the city that save David was shattering and typing out the New Jerusalem kill all you see that's what people don't understand these people who have been listening to these intellectual Giants what's happening their main their lame they can't even believe the gospel they're blind and what's happening now it is God the same David that's literally killing a Joab Joab killing everything amen often taken off everything that won't enter into the city of Jerusalem hmm my notes about joy at what his name was but some way I misplaced but I believe it means that Jehovah is God or Jehovah is our God something like that but what was your app doing he was actually now Joey I've messed up too but Joey was doing the will of God when he went and took took Jerusalem back from the Japanese ice hmm y'all didn't know that that Jerusalem used to be a Gentile city before it was the City of David hmm and now what's going to happen it's gonna be another gentle City a city with everybody there there'll be no Jew nor Greek is that right no Gentile barn are free hallelujah we'll all be there you said what brother bones what are you saying I'm saying this and all and all of us to make it up and I'm telling you I'm going through a lot of battles right now but now I have a better perspective on life because I realized that everything I'm going through no matter how painful it may be is to build character his character in me I am thoroughly excited about the finished product because he promised it God promised it he promised the finished product and I believe this seed that I have in me cannot stop growing it's perfect it's a perfect seed it's able to penetrate through through concrete walls humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that ye may be exalted into time casting all your cares upon him for he careth Karen continually cares for you be sober be vigilant before your Eva's because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walking about seeking whom he may devour now we would have thought eight that the devil still had power but brother Adam said he doesn't he's like a lion with no teeth all he's got is a roar right he's a bee with no stinger he lost all of his powers be sober be village' because your adversary as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who have called us unto eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect is that all right did you get on my knee suffering huh it's worth while they're gonna be giving out rewards out there you know I don't know you said well they ain't gonna make me no different you gonna not feel so well I don't know how God gonna handle that with everybody getting the reward y'all know how it is when school time is over you know and you know they giving out rewards on just before you graduate a pass to the next grade and everybody's getting all these certificates and you hope that all the time you thinking I wish I'd have done better I wish I would have been more attentive I wish I wouldn't have missed those days I hate I was late cuz even a a perfect attendant certificate means something on that day and you feel left out when everybody's getting their rewards hey somebody help me here it's gonna make a difference everybody think we're gonna have on the same uniforms and the same clothing and that's not true you and I there will be a men not like the world system don't get me wrong but there will be places where prophets were set there will be places where the people who follow prophets will say there would be places whether whether the apostles and all that you know what I'm saying there will be ranking brother Branham said it we will all have ranking everybody won't have the same amount of crowns everybody won't have the same amount of reward but one thing for certain none of us will be jealous of the other we wouldn't care in that respect hallelujah like the Prophet God said even if I'm a doormat it's all right see because remember you know when it comes to our greatest joy would be Jesus himself like that man said don't be telling me about no roads in North crown I want to see him that's my don't tell me about no rose and ground I want to see him oh my god ah but the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after that ye have suffered a wild make you perfect stablish strengthens and settles you to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever it did say to you be glory he said to him be glory all the glory and honor goes to God I'm not finished with this subject I've had to preach more on it but because I want to bring some things out of saw out of Samuel Amen some things dealing with the same horse riders how he rode and stuff like that I as much as I can see through the scriptures I want to show you that this thing Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother Branham said all that is laying in the Bible he said now I'm just touching the surface but I have these preachers come and they'll take it from there and show you so we he knew he was coming and he knew that preachers was and preaching was important to take us higher because the Bible said the fivefold ministry is here for the perfecting of the Saints and if you take that out of the Word of God I don't care who you are you are in danger you cannot chop the Word of God up and because now you're trying to say Jesus Christ is not the same he's always the same I even heard on on on the message on today I think it was the fifth seal but even well brother bear I'm saying our true prophet of God will not glorify himself and don't want to be glorified so who are you and none of us say ain't nowhere near him I heard him the other day how he was talking about he at that time he had about 2 million souls he had one to the Lord two million that's not it that's not at the end that was in the early stage of his ministry two million but like I said the other day everybody was no danger do two million and remember Amen when it when it came to Ruth Ruth came in at a time of gleaning and all she could get with I think about seven ears of corn or something like that but you see that was her measure good and faithful servant if God ordained you to just give two pennies good and faithful servants you understand me as long as we all reach his purpose for which he put us here for we've hit a hundred percent and our wars would be as much you said all not with God yes it is let's go back to the way God calculate thing he said at the eleventh hour I'm gonna give you a penny he said that the first hour I give you a penny right at the end of the day they all got pennies and the one servant said oh we don't work all days and how can I be unjust didn't I promised you a penny I gave you a penny if I promised him a penny and I give him a penny I'm just as just to him as I was to you it's my money it's my money I do with what I want to do with it thank God for what you got now you should get jealous we'll see Paul and them and do all of the things they do and I think to myself Lord what it is you know we barely see what you know and God said but you see you don't understand you you and I we live in the time that Paul them could live in you living in a time that William Branham couldn't live in because of the way he was built he would have had a nervous breakdown if he was to see what is going on on these streets God had to take him he wasn't built for this he could see it but he couldn't live it and have a peace of mind he saw in his day what he so and he wanted to run out into the woods and God said if you did that you gonna become a bomb it was - you can't do that see here that enlarges period Lord said not to fire is that the truth he did he stood behind that door and saw that lady with the purple hair the purple fingernails and everything Lord how can you put up with this see that was that Elijah's spirit speaking to it through him God saw there to say hey come on back here I'm gonna talk to you a little bit the same blood that's around this earth is bouncing your sins off just like it is hers is that right god corrected a prophet concerning a lady that looked like a prostitute you're no better than she is I'm protecting you my blood is covering your sins and then you want me to get rid of her you understand me a lot of time we don't understand how God loves his children is that right Jesus says that the Father loves us even as he loved him who seventeenth chapter of John amen so people have got we're blessed this ain't no hard way to go I really believe with all of my heart if I had like a year or so to go to live at the day of my death if it takes that I believe God will make I'll be perfect God will not allow me to fall asleep I'm perfect imperfect and so even to us you said well what do you mean God can give you a growth spirit a growth just like that if God can change your heart over the center while he's there on Calvary make him take him from being a murderer to a saint in the matter of a moment or two what do you think God can do for you none of us are worthy but God said he will complete that which he has begun in you that's what I hold God to because he promised me he was gonna complete me so I don't worry about it if deficits knock on my door why should I worry what we fearing it's gonna come anyhow if they go to confid you fear is not going to convert you and fear will not stop it from happening so you might as well enjoy Jesus people say enjoy him enjoy the fact that I'm getting ready to go home with God let's tan God is real and we must trust him you know God didn't put the salvation in your hands and I know sometime I preach it like it is but it ain't in your hands it's in God's hand but what I believe the Word of God is trying to produce a desire in you to love him so much that you desire to be perfect at whatever cost it doesn't make any any difference on the consequences I want to be perfect you know and I realized that in this message I think I tried to say that this morning we think that everybody in this message you see and it's not we figure because they call on the name of the Lord Jesus and they have a picture of the prophet of God if their church will no no no no no not even all the Catholic Church are the same not even all the Baptist churches are the same you know what the Church of the Living God our people not buildings and dude you can have a building looking and looking all fabulous and beautiful amen with all kinds of signs and types of pictures and things on the wall and it don't mean a thing if the preacher think he's our King y'all hear what I'm saying if the preacher thinks that he's better than the people that's an antichrist that's what the preachers and then what happened they began to lord over them hello yo y'all hear what I'm saying in this message we don't have Kings like that cuz we all kings and priests before God hmm we all sheep hey somebody help me here I always take brother branham's life as an example and when I say that I mean the humility that that man had never wanted to give honor to himself but always gave honor to the Lord Jesus Christ the humility that if anybody could have been puffed up in his age it was him nobody could do the miracles the signs and wonders that he did in his ministry nothing nobody Billy Graham Oral Roberts nobody in that age had the kind of ministry that he had if he wanted to be something great he could have been but you know what he said he said God will let me do it [Laughter] hallelujah he was a prisoner of Christ I love that I love that and you know if anything if I entered anything about brother Branham I I love and so it is that I want to live like he lived in the face of God if I if I cherished and coveted anything that would be it it ain't the hunting is not the fishing it's not the way he dressed young me or combed his hair okay nothing it's the Christ that I look and see that's what I get psyched about it because that Christ was in 2000 years ago that was just yesterday for us you love the Lord he had to be an example in that way people had to be for us to see Christ in him and what crisis and he says look I'm not the only pebble on the beach but this is what I come to do and understand they are more coming oh and who are the more you and I we don't have that same measure of faith but we have a measure of faith that's power father God we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord I know and I see what I see it doesn't matter Lord God we realize oh god that there's all kinds of spirits Oh God all kinds of things moving in this day and father I just pray right now God that we will all of us we'll just not so focused on the things of the world but focus on what you require of us father we realize Oh God that we are coming to an end Lord we just saw there the other day where where Indonesia had a earthquake and a tsunami what is it the world in his birth pains shifting and shaping itself Oh God for this great earthquake that's are going to happen pretty soon help us now Lord God that will be a ready Church a supernatural church made in your image and your likeness conquering by the power of love divine the divine love Lord that's what you said this is what has given you the victory oh love divine and that was said in a way of French will let's put it right this is what gives us the victory in divine love thank you Jesus for everything that you have done for us but we desire to be crowned with your divine love won't be satisfied until we meet your measures take us there leaders there guide us there under whatever cause it may cause granite Lord it's my will and desire to be perfect in that sight it is our will in his our to be perfect in your sight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen so that you realized that because you claim to be the word that spirit of Antichrist will always come to anoint or to deceive you and you have to always be on God amen to make sure that you're straight with the word amen I love the Lord Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah one more thought sometimes we think being perfect in God is out here casting out Devils moving mountains stopping storms that's not it you know you can be a housewife and be perfect a farmer and be perfect just a ordinary person and be perfect so don't think that you got to have these supernatural wings on you or some kind of Batman cape you don't have that it's just you God in you most of the time when you're standing perfect most people don't even recognize you but God recognizes your perfection so be encouraged be encouraged everybody in the church is not ordained to do everything everybody have their portion in there pause and so just whatever your portion in part is was just praying if the singing if it's just doing things around the church whatever it is just be perfect in what you can be and God will reward you for you love the Lord amen amen [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] keep me close to the side of my savior and let me neighboring keep my free from rap and my soul satisfy fill my way every day with my way every day we always I was with the heavenly dog or let me go although I with a song and it's my in my way every day we love soon the race with people in the travel normal are divided in my home and ball let me sing lesson King all the way to the shore in my way every day we love long as I walk with the heavy needs are plenty goal do i with a song and it's mine in my way
