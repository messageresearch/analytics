you know and he's keeping me praise the name of the Lord before I go to the scripture I want to bring some of the things concerning the country of India I present the present government in India they're very very bad you know to the Christians they are not for Christianity and they want to wipe out Christianity by 2021 22 all these years it was a different government and of course they were also Hindus but they were a good Hindus and they gave freedom to each and every religion in that country there are so many religions in India so many languages so many cultures you know so many you know many everything many many gods and you know so India is not a new country if you read in the book of Esther King Ahasuerus was ruling 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia you'll find it in the book of Esther chapter one praise the name of the Lord so land is land wise it is smaller than the United States but the population wise you know it's very you know it's one half-billion you know one and a half billion officially Chinese first but you know Chinese controlling and but India a religion won't allow them to control you know so we have one-and-a-half billion more than one and a half billion because thousands are born in the countryside where there is no hospitals they're born at home and they're not registered with the government you know so that way I say you know we are number one unofficially number one in the world majority wise you know so anyhow now this present government they want to wipe out Christianity by 2020 122 they're killing a lot of Christians lot of pastors burning churches burning Bibles and you know we used to have you know open-air meetings you know in the open area you know once once we're in the meetings one brother billions came to India it was eleven thousand people you know the next time he came we had a special meeting it was a thirteen thousand people you know but nowadays we can't have you know that kind of meetings in India you know anyhow i anointed as Isaiah to come and visit us we can have it a wonderful prayer meetings in the in the church you know not blessed us with a wonderful wonderful place and praise the name of the Lord if anybody wants to come to India you're most welcome only thing you need a visa to come to India and you never to say that you are going to preach but you are coming to visit friends you know there's no problem so anyhow you know they are deadly against Christianity and they are deadly against Muslim people also and you know Christians we keep quiet like Jesus said you know if one if somebody slaps you on one cheek give another chick so you know but but you know Muslims they're not going to keep quiet they're waiting for the revenge you know and we have second majority eighty percent majority goes to Hinduism now Hinduism means the hedonism you know they believe in many gods many gods there is a saying they believe in 33 millions gods and goddesses don't ask with her names I don't know and then second majority goes to Muslims Islamic people and the third a majority a 50/50 percent majority that goes to Muslim people and then five percent Christianity and the majority goes to Catholic Church you know and Catholics are big everywhere you know so anyhow we have all the denominations in India what do you have here you know so anyhow please pray for the Christians in India many Christians they're slaughtered you know you know one of our one of our pastor recently last one 28 he was having prayer meeting at Easter at this place you know and there was about 50 60

the mission in your special prayers when I was when I was little I come out from a very poor family I know what is hunger means I know what is poverty means I know what his hunger means you know and I I went through that many years you know there was no place to stay I used to stay on the streets with my poor mom and dad and then you know no proper clothings no proper house to leave no proper food to eat you know and I used to walk I used to walk three hours one way you know because of the poverty you know and then turn and three hours coming back oh so there was a time you know I think last time I shared something you know maybe you remember some of the things you know I was so poor when I could when I walk three I was coming from school to home at home nothing is there to eat you know and so so I used to go to the vegetable market you know we don't have markets like you have here you know but we have smaller markets there and the you know they the the the people they throw away you know stinking potatoes or tomatoes or some vegetable do the throw away because the the customers they don't buy that you see you know I used to go and collect them and bring them and wash them and you know put some salt and and cayenne paper you know that way you know I used to eat you know many times I have done that you know I'm telling this for the glory of God and I I know what is hunger and poverty means you know and God gave me grace when I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ when Lord started blessing me praise the name of the Lord I started orphanage with ten children the ten children you

know but is the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord hallelujah huh when he comes in our minister praise the name of the Lord they have to respect him give him the first first mover hands in our lives thank you Jesus whatever God says anything you love more than Jesus anything you love more than Jesus that's the idol worship my precious sisters please love Jesus first don't bring children between between you and him love Jesus first then then is is the great you know great God he bless you in everywhere he will take care of your family take care of her children you take care of your business he will take care of everything when you give first preference in your life to Him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hmm now 430 years is the lights we're in Egypt they were slaves and Pharaoh killed so many innocent people you know they were slaves they have no right to talk they were bound 430 years but they were crying to God and God heard their cry and said Moses praise the name of the Lord hallelujah when the mighty hand with a great power with the great miracles brought them out of Egypt trace the name of the Lord brought them out set them free that's what you know but what happened they've forgotten what God has done in their lives and that's what we are doing now with the expression rather than justice we are forgetting the Lord they are not giving him due honor they forgotten that's why the psalmist says here some 106 7 to 15 our fathers understood not died wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multi multitude of thy mercies our God is a great God having so many you know ways you know his mercies with us but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless he served them for his name's sake yea he saved us for his name's sake we remember that do you know that not because of our righteousness not because we are very good you know but he saved us for his name's sake don't forget that you are saved by grace we are all saved by grace not because we've been righteous Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and he saved them from the last from the hand of them that hated them and reamed them from the hand of the enemy no I missed something here nevertheless he saved them for his namesake that he might make his mighty power to be known he removed the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths and through the wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that aided them and relieve them from the end of the enemy he has done same thing with us also he redeemed us from the hand of the enemy our enemy is the devil thank God for His grace and mercy and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left they believed they his words they're saying his place they'd soon forget his works they forgot his works they waited not for his concert but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul people forgotten in Exodus chapter 14 verse 31 says and is that I saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant after you know after the Red Sea you know and the reason she was divided the sort of miracle did they started believing you know what they forgot Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Moses that endurance seeing him who is invisible exactly the opposite was true the children of Israel in this record they endured only when the circumstances were favourable hmm they allowed him they praised him only when the circumstances were favorable they were largely governed by the things that appealed to their senses in place of resting in the invisible the eternal God today we need to rest in God praise the name of the Lord we need to praise Him we need to worship Him we need to magnifies them we need to exalt his name praise the name of the Lord hallelujah don't forget we are where we are in the same compartment like Enoch Enoch was a great man of God there was three special qualities in his life three special qualities in his life and that's the reason God took him away alive and we are waiting for the same thing we are ready for the rapture we are waiting for the change of a bodies but there are three important things like in Enochs life we have to do number one my Bible says Enoch walked with God today if you want to go in the rapture if you want to inherit God's kingdom you need to walk not by words you know the tower deeds we need to walk with Jesus we need to walk with God praise the name of the Lord number one called it he walked with God number two he was pleasing God we have to please him just like a wife please her husband the Book of Isaiah says your creator is your husband our Creator is our husband that's why I said I am the I will be the queen of the coming kingdom royal crown is waiting for me there for me and you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah walk with your husband trust in him love him respect him glorify Him that is the duty of the wife praise the name of the Lord Enoch walked with God Enoch was pleasing God in every step and the third he was witnessing about God he was witnessing about God today our job is to witness to others about Jesus sharing the love of Jesus Christ with others share what God has done in your life to others do not shut your mouth open let us open our mouth and speak to our neighbors our friends praise the name of the talk with them that's that's what that precious sister put a song let's talk about Jesus let's talk about Jesus I like that song I don't know how to sing but let's talk about Jesus let's share the love of Jesus Christ with others praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so we are waiting for the change of our bodies we are waiting for the rapture anyhow faith is very important believe in God believe in him to see the great miracles in the present that in the present day there are those who live intermittent Christian lives because they have become occupied with the outward and center in circumstances in place of centering in God instead of centering in God you know I'm sorry to say you know nowadays this I am NOT against cell phones even I use cell phone I am NOT against internet I'm not against you know but this cell phone is become number one God I present oh my god yeah when I come in the presence of God not blessed me with the two two phones and said it check it there is time for everything there is time for everything when you are in the presence of God you need to dedicate this time for the glory of God thank you Jesus there is time for everything god help us today we need to be center in God let us have center ring in God God wants us more and more to see him in everything and to call nothing small if it bears us his message here we read the children of Israel then they believed his words they did not believe till after they saw when they saw him work then they believed God is not interested in those kind of people God wanted them to believe first to see the miracles of God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah whom he had we read of the children of Israel then they believed his words they did not believe till after they saw when they saw him work then they believed they really doubted God are we doubting God precious brothers and sisters we will be nowhere if we doubt God trust in the Lord trust in the Lord 100 percent thousand percent million person trust in the Lord they really did God when they came to the Red Sea but God opened the way and led them across the across there so Pharaoh and his host ground then they believed the leader pearl they led an up-and-down life life up-and-down life you know because of this kind of faith it was a faith that depended upon circumstances this is not the kind of faith God wants us to have God wants us to have a perfect faith faith maybe we should do I believed God I have faith in God that's why I'm saying I got saved that's not enough we need more and more faith if you have faith that the faith can bring you bring God to your place because of a faith faith can bring Jesus Christ into your job into your home in your church into your business into a family faith without faith it's impossible to please God precious brothers and sisters if you read Hebrews chapter 11 you will be blood what happened because of the faith what is great people great prophets did my faith my faith descent amount of mouth of the Lions by faith they they were put in the fiery furnace or what happened their faith helped them the fire couldn't touch them Lions couldn't touch him praise the name of the Lord ever they were a few in number but they challenged the Kings emperors when you have faith then only you can challenge if you don't have faith it's hard to challenge precious brothers and sisters god help us in Psalms 27 verse 13 and 14 says i had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait say on the Lord in second chorus in chapter 5 verse 7 says for we walk by faith not by sight praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank God for the prophet in our generation can you take few more time brother ok praise Allah thank God for the Prophet in our generation thank God for the revelation of Jesus Christ thank God for the 7 seals thank God for the 7 church ages thank God for the wonderful messages thank God for the prophet in our generation his name is William Marion Branham we are not worshiping him is God there are people in India I was telling pastor Isaiah America is the mother for good and bad America is the mother for good and bad and everything is coming from here going going from here to other countries and the people in other countries they are innocent they believe now we have a few churches in India southern parts they believe in Christ Branham they believe in Christ Branham in blue serpent if you if you if you study that if you read that message will sharpen the Prophet is talking you know you know they are worship they are worshipping weather item whether I'm sorry I'm forgive me they're worshipping brother app brother branham is the god they're baptizing the people in the name of Christ Branham they they say it's a new name if you don't believe you go to hell huh innocent people are buried in the name of Christ burger and the prophet of God said in blue serpent if you are making this you are making me Antichrist huh he was not happy with that and today people are talking against the Prophet the preachers who preach for thirty years forty years there are no where now what happened to them what happened to them they preached for thirty years you know 40 years precious burned their captured they are captured by the darkness gurus darkness if you read Isaiah chapter 60 says whole world is captured by the gross darkness but remember as a man of God I will tell you we are washed in the blood of Jesus Christ we are people of God we are children of God the darkness got no right to capture you are in the light we are in the light because if you read in chapter 62 die light is come die light is come praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you belongs to light you belongs to die you know you're not belong to darkness they are belongs to light the red light is Lord Jesus Christ now people are very very light you know very simple talking against the Prophet he never done any harm to anybody can you show me one place where brother Brandenburg than any hurt anybody's feelings or or he done anything wrong to them he spoke the truth he was a humblest person upon this rd allah the exalted exalted the name of God Jesus he'd never done any harm to anybody so why people should talk against him when you do that the Word of God says do not touch my anointed by word or deed do not touch my anointed by word or deed there you are landed in trouble and then the thing I want to say brother Isaac you know this message never belongs to brother William Marion Branham this message belongs to the Holy Ghost then you try to find a mistake you rate the message you are trying to find mistake with the Holy Ghost and the Bible says if you talk against the Holy Ghost there is no forgiveness here or there so what you are going to do by changing the Prophet by judging the message you have let you landed in great trauma I'm generally talking Christian brothers and sisters because there is a situation in the message circle you know they're trying to talk against the Prophet he never done any harm to anybody trying to find mistakes with the message by finding fault with the Holy Ghost that's dangerous let us love this message abide in this message this is a bye this message got the special Grace a bite got this way this message got the special grace my precious brothers and sisters that that that this message got the special faith give you me rapture in faith praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I feel sorry for them who speak against the Prophet I feel sorry for them who speaking speak against the message this message got the special grace thank God for the Prophet in 1953 the prophet of God preached taking God at His Word taking God at His Word now what is faith faith is the substance if the substance
