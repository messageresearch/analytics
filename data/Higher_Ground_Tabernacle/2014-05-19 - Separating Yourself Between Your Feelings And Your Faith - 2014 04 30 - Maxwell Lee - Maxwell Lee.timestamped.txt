[24:21] we don't it's not that we don't believe
[24:23] in music
[24:26] we do believe in music
[24:29] amen we don't have any drums so I use
[24:31] everything I got amen so we praise God
[24:34] for that amen come on brother I don't
[24:35] want to prolong the time but uh I know
[24:38] we're going to be blessed tonight God
[24:39] bless you
[24:43] praise the wonderful name of the Lord
[24:45] amen
[24:46] it's just a joy and a privilege to be
[24:48] here and we truly want to thank God for
[24:51] his loving kindness and it's beyond the
[24:54] human imagination
[24:57] because you know I remember it's a very
[24:59] long time I've being invited to come
[25:01] into the United States since I was like
[25:04] 17 18 years of age and that's over 30
[25:08] something years ago because you have
[25:10] lots of Minister who came across from
[25:12] the United States and I remember most of
[25:15] the old brothers who you know passed her
[25:18] away before man like brother Jerry Roya
[25:21] brother James walls and brother you know
[25:24] Dan daisley and you know all these
[25:27] brother Henry green and all those
[25:28] brothers and you know since that time
[25:31] you know there was never really a pull
[25:33] to come here and you know God allow
[25:35] brother Isaiah to pass our away and you
[25:38] know he was the one God leap in his
[25:40] heart to do so so we want to thank God
[25:42] for grace and his loving kindness and
[25:44] you know he he said it all you know
[25:47] being a blessing he him God you know is
[25:49] not just being a blessing but is to
[25:51] receive a blessing so he has been a
[25:53] blessing to us and we also had received
[25:55] a blessing because we know know that as
[25:58] Sons and Daughters of God we can pull
[26:00] from each other amen hallelujah because
[26:03] the hour the season that we living in
[26:05] the prophet of God tells us that there
[26:07] is hardly any love left the only place
[26:10] that you could find true love is among
[26:11] the true elected of God hallelujah it
[26:14] goes beyond the flesh hallelujah it's by
[26:17] the Holy Spirit and we truly want to
[26:19] thank God for this season that he has
[26:20] allowed me to be here and you know it
[26:23] was not much planning because when God
[26:26] does something you know it does
[26:28] immediately you know it's just like
[26:30] Abraham when God called Abraham you know
[26:32] he didn't had big plan in his mind but
[26:35] when you're being Inspire of God you
[26:36] move on that inspiration and you know we
[26:39] want to thank God for grace and love and
[26:41] mercy and I do trust God that my coming
[26:44] here that I could be a blessing to you
[26:46] and also receive a blessing you know in
[26:48] Fellowship because the only time that we
[26:52] are here to have Fellowship is this
[26:54] season because we come to realize that
[26:57] we all always in a constant battle we
[26:59] always in a constant Warfare and the
[27:01] proud of God tells the only time that we
[27:03] have to hit back against the devil is
[27:06] now while he's punching at us that's the
[27:08] only chance we can get to hit back at
[27:10] him because we come to realize that we
[27:12] are truly in a battle we are in a
[27:14] Warfare and saints of God is not that we
[27:17] as Believers we love to fight but
[27:19] because God have called us to be in this
[27:21] position we have to fight amen and it's
[27:23] not me and you the individual but it's
[27:26] the God in us because the proph of God
[27:28] tells us that Satan hates anything that
[27:31] God's love Hallelujah because God love
[27:34] you Satan will always be after you
[27:36] praise God so I would like to bring
[27:38] greetings from my wife and family and
[27:41] the church back in Georgetown Guyana and
[27:44] you know we always love the Believers
[27:46] across here and you know it has been a
[27:49] tremendous blessing to us and we truly
[27:51] believe that you know the season that we
[27:54] living in that God have us prepared in a
[27:58] in a raptured season Hallelujah because
[28:00] we know with everything that is
[28:02] happening around the world that God is
[28:04] here with us this evening so I bring you
[28:06] greetings from them and the Believers
[28:08] throughout Guyana because it's not just
[28:10] the church where and the pastor there
[28:12] but Isaiah has been a blessing but
[28:14] throughout the country in Guyana because
[28:17] every August around the the second week
[28:20] of August we have a camp meeting and
[28:22] this year coming will be the 21st annual
[28:25] camp meeting and God has a allowed us to
[28:27] be here remember one time it was the eth
[28:30] of the E of the E and you know I I'm not
[28:33] a person really to look at certain
[28:35] things but that particular Sunday when I
[28:37] went out there the Lord just inspired he
[28:38] said look at your watch I said the eth
[28:40] of the eight of the eight and not
[28:42] knowing that brother Isaiah had in his
[28:43] mind you know what the Lord had inspired
[28:45] to him and I look at it says something
[28:47] you know probably you know just leave it
[28:50] that way but when the Holy Ghost came
[28:52] and ministered the word it was a a a
[28:55] backto back service and one of the the
[28:58] brother the people who were there
[28:59] couldn't understand you know because
[29:01] when God leads you to do things you just
[29:03] don't do it by your own self and when
[29:06] God lead you to do thing hallelujah it's
[29:08] always a blessing and it was a
[29:10] tremendous blessing it was a the
[29:11] presence of God came down and you know
[29:14] it was a life-changing experience to
[29:16] many praise God and it be so happy to be
[29:19] part of that so that blessing you know
[29:22] has what me say emulated in the hearts
[29:25] of many and it's still going on today
[29:27] and through the ministry we believe that
[29:29] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[29:32] and forever and you know the proud of
[29:34] God tells us in a message the reproach
[29:37] for the cause of the word he tells us
[29:39] that you know that everything comes in
[29:41] its right season I'm going to read what
[29:42] he says here in par in paragraph 81 he
[29:45] says God sets a time and has a purpose
[29:48] for everything that he does how many of
[29:51] you believe that and there is nothing
[29:53] happened just accidentally to those who
[29:56] love the Lord amen and are called
[29:58] according to his calling see we are
[30:00] predestinated and everything works just
[30:03] right amen hallelujah for that because
[30:06] he cannot lie and he said that was so
[30:09] that everything has its time its season
[30:13] and it has its way and God is behind
[30:16] every move how many you believe that God
[30:19] is behind every move it doesn't matter
[30:22] what I feel and what I think and what
[30:24] others think about the whole thing God
[30:26] is being every move and it says
[30:29] sometimes you think that everything is
[30:31] going wrong how many time you feel in
[30:33] your life that things are going wrong
[30:35] and you feel that they're just messed up
[30:36] and there is no way out you say
[30:38] sometimes you think that everything is
[30:40] going wrong it's up to us those things
[30:43] are put Upon Us trials and wonderings
[30:48] it's testing to see how we will react on
[30:51] an action so we want to thank God this
[30:54] evening Hallelujah is a reaction to an
[30:57] actionj and God call us hallelujah of
[31:00] people to be in action God is calling
[31:02] his people praise God to be in action
[31:05] this evening and we truly want to thank
[31:07] God you know it's very difficult for me
[31:10] to really what me say in speaking much
[31:13] and giving introduction and all these
[31:15] things but one of my pet word is come
[31:18] and see amen you know come and see I
[31:20] think that that could be the the
[31:22] greatest introduction you know because
[31:24] to explain things it's very difficult
[31:26] and I'm not good in explaining things
[31:29] but we thank God and I'm so happy to be
[31:31] here and I feel a warm welcome praise
[31:34] God of the holy spirit in his Believers
[31:36] of like Precious faith it doesn't matter
[31:38] how far we from remember we have one
[31:41] Heavenly Father amen hallelujah praise
[31:44] God it's one spirit it's one Faith it's
[31:45] one baptism so culture doesn't matter
[31:49] when it comes to the grace of God in our
[31:50] life Hallelujah because we are bought by
[31:53] his Precious Blood Hallelujah so we
[31:55] truly happy and thankful to be here
[31:57] and you know we trust the few days being
[32:00] with you that we could all receive a
[32:02] blessing from God and we come to realize
[32:04] that when you think about this message
[32:07] this ministry that God has given to us
[32:10] is not about human personality it's all
[32:13] about the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[32:15] it's all about him and when you look at
[32:17] our prophet he didn't had his own
[32:19] personality because he always points you
[32:21] to Christ and he says every true servant
[32:24] or any true prophet of God he always
[32:26] points you back back to the word and
[32:28] saints of God that is the greatest thing
[32:30] that we could do because Paul whatever
[32:32] Paul did Hallelujah he was pointing us
[32:35] to Christ Jesus Hallelujah says follow
[32:37] me as I follow Christ praise God so we
[32:41] are have people of great hope and we
[32:43] have a great privilege and let us take
[32:45] the best advantage of the privilege that
[32:48] God has given onto US how many you
[32:50] willing to do that praise God let us all
[32:53] just stand together as we turn to our
[32:55] Bibles in know the book of St Mark
[32:58] chapter 8 reading from Verses 4
[33:01] throughout 38 praise the name of the
[33:04] Lord and i' like to speak on a little
[33:06] thought this evening um separating
[33:10] separating yourself between your
[33:12] feelings and your faith hallelujah how
[33:14] many you believe that amen the time has
[33:16] come when you know there many time we
[33:18] have feelings Hallelujah but you know
[33:21] the fate of God goes beyond my feelings
[33:23] it goes beyond your feelings and
[33:25] feelings go as far as the flesh can go
[33:28] but Faith goes beyond flesh Faith goes
[33:31] beyond reasoning praise God and when he
[33:34] had called the people unto him with his
[33:37] disciples also he said unto them
[33:39] whosoever will come after me let him
[33:42] deny himself and take up his cross and
[33:45] follow me for whosoever will save his
[33:48] life shall lose it but whosoever shall
[33:51] lose his life for my sake and a gospel
[33:54] the same shall save it amen for what
[33:58] shall it profit a man if he shall gain
[34:01] the world the whole world and lose his
[34:03] own soul or what shall a man give an
[34:06] exchange for his soul
[34:08] whatsoever therefore whosoever therefore
[34:12] shall be ashamed of me and of my word in
[34:15] this adulterous and sinful generation of
[34:18] him also shall the son of man be ashamed
[34:21] when he cometh in glory of his father
[34:23] with the Holy Angels gracious God
[34:27] Hallelujah and Heavenly Father Lord we
[34:30] want to thank thee For Your Love Lord we
[34:32] want to thank you for your mercies oh
[34:34] God that you can allow us Lord to come
[34:36] into your presence Lord this evening
[34:39] Lord and we recognize you promis in your
[34:41] word whereever two or three are gathered
[34:44] together Lord in your name that you're
[34:46] there in the midst to bless Lord we pray
[34:49] God that you may bless us richly Lord oh
[34:51] God as we come to Feast on around your
[34:53] table with your word that you have
[34:55] provided for us Lord we give you the
[34:57] praise and the honor and the glory in
[34:58] Jesus name amen praise God you may be
[35:01] seated saints of God this time and the
[35:05] season that we living in we see that the
[35:08] world is falling apart Hallelujah we see
[35:12] churches are falling apart we see homes
[35:15] are falling apart and we see individuals
[35:17] are falling apart Hallelujah but Jesus
[35:20] Christ Still Remains the same yesterday
[35:23] today and forever and we come to
[35:25] recognize when God called us and place
[35:28] us here upon the face of the Earth it
[35:30] was his program it was his mind it was
[35:33] not me and you wanted to serve God
[35:36] hallelujah but God placed in us his life
[35:39] his Gene his seed and because of that we
[35:42] could not have helped ourselves huah
[35:44] other than to come in God's provided way
[35:46] although we know that we were born in
[35:48] sin and we were shapen in iniquity
[35:50] saints of God that was just the adamic
[35:52] nature Hallelujah but having the seed of
[35:55] God in us hallelujah we come to realize
[35:57] that God has placed Us in time and in
[36:00] season and as we the quote that we read
[36:02] just now God he knows the time and he
[36:05] knows the season and nothing is out to
[36:07] cater with God and even us being here
[36:10] this evening God knows and he recognize
[36:13] that it would have been this time it
[36:14] would have been this season you know
[36:16] many time man will try to plan and we
[36:18] could be good planners we can be good
[36:20] thinkers but if we don't have the
[36:22] leadership of the Holy Spirit to come
[36:24] and to Grace us and to bless us with
[36:26] that leadership we all be in vain all we
[36:30] will be so tired and we'll work
[36:31] ourselves out but saints of God we come
[36:33] to realize in this hour we want to be
[36:36] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[36:39] Hallelujah we want to be sons being led
[36:41] by the spirit of God so we come to
[36:43] realize the scripture that we read here
[36:45] he was calling his disciples and they
[36:48] and you know he was telling them of the
[36:49] time and the season and how they have to
[36:52] take up the cross and follow him because
[36:54] it calls for a total separation from
[36:56] from the world and the things of the
[36:58] world and when we come to realize it's
[37:00] not man bringing that separation it's
[37:02] the word of God because the Bible says
[37:05] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[37:07] the word of God and as you hear the word
[37:09] of God hallelujah it brings you into the
[37:11] revelation of his word and you could a
[37:14] person you a person can only live
[37:16] hallelujah what is being revealed to
[37:18] them if something is not being revealed
[37:20] to them they will react and they will
[37:22] act differently but we come to realize
[37:24] the proud of God tells us also is not
[37:27] you know our is the person's attitude
[37:30] towards us but is our attitude towards
[37:32] the individual so when you have the
[37:34] spirit of Christ inside of you saints of
[37:36] God your attitude and your whole
[37:38] disposition it will be different the
[37:40] prod of God says there in a message
[37:42] God's word call for total separation
[37:44] from unbelief it's a 64121
[37:47] paragraph 59 he tells us but when a man
[37:50] is born in the world for a Believer he
[37:54] becomes a Nazarite amen when he
[37:56] separates himself from anything that's
[37:59] contrary to the word amen that is what
[38:02] God want us to separate from anything
[38:05] that is contrary to the word and he says
[38:07] a total separation Jesus said I come to
[38:11] separate a man from his wife he said
[38:14] tear up a family now to the car minded
[38:17] they say these are very hard statements
[38:20] Hallelujah but the Sons and Daughters of
[38:22] God hallelujah this is words of Promise
[38:25] amen hallelujah praise God and he that
[38:28] would take up his cross and follow me is
[38:31] not worthy to be called mine amen how
[38:35] many of you will have taken up your
[38:36] cross and follow him the only way that
[38:38] you can be worthy of this gospel is to
[38:41] surrender your whole life before him
[38:43] Hallelujah a separation from everything
[38:46] anything and it's very striking says
[38:50] separate from church
[38:52] amen from a community from a belief amen
[38:56] or from family or anything that would
[38:59] stand between you and believing the
[39:02] entire word of God it's not just the
[39:05] word of God but the entire word of God
[39:09] many time we say that we are message
[39:11] Believers but do we entirely believe the
[39:13] word of God Amen just as how the pr of
[39:16] God hallelujah he spoke on Deliverance
[39:19] but he says not just a Deliverance but a
[39:21] total Deliverance a lot of people are
[39:23] being delivered but they need a total
[39:25] Deliverance a lot of a lot of people say
[39:28] they believe the message of the hour but
[39:30] saints of God they don't believe the
[39:32] entire word of God hallelujah that is
[39:35] why you have so much intellectuals
[39:37] following the message and when the
[39:39] intellectual they follow the message
[39:41] they don't entirely believe the fullness
[39:43] of the word of God hallelujah that is
[39:45] why today you have a lot of scoffers and
[39:47] mockers around because they don't
[39:49] believe the fullness of the word in
[39:50] entirety when you believe the fullness
[39:52] of the word in entirety anything that
[39:55] God says hallelujah it will be separated
[39:57] from the world Hallelujah because you
[39:59] are Sons and Daughters of God praise God
[40:02] say anything that wouldn't stand
[40:04] anything that would stand between you
[40:06] and believing the entire word he says if
[40:08] your soul will not punctuate every
[40:11] promise for this hour with a amen there
[40:14] is something wrong somewhere you need a
[40:18] separation saints of God we need a
[40:20] separation Hallelujah this is between
[40:23] life and death Hallelujah and we come
[40:26] realize today when you when you truly
[40:29] become a form believer in Christ Jesus
[40:32] you don't think about your family ties
[40:34] you don't think of this Blood Hallelujah
[40:36] but you think Hallelujah about the Life
[40:39] of Christ Jesus the holy ghost coming
[40:41] inside of you Hallelujah because there
[40:43] will be coming a time you know many time
[40:46] we sing that that little chorus I'm on
[40:49] my way to canaan's land if my mama don't
[40:51] come if my papa don't come he don't
[40:53] hinder me but when I was a little boy
[40:55] when I hear that if my mama don't come
[40:56] and papa don't come it didn't hinder me
[40:58] so what kind of song they singing and I
[41:00] love my mother I love my father so much
[41:02] but when you grow up and you receive the
[41:04] revelation of this word there is nothing
[41:06] that can separate you from the love of
[41:08] God hallelujah no father no mother no
[41:11] brother Hallelujah no wife no husband
[41:13] because we believe what a proud of God
[41:15] say is God first Hallelujah then your
[41:17] family after and then you the individual
[41:20] so it calls for separating separating
[41:22] yourself between your feelings and your
[41:24] faith and there are many times we work
[41:26] on feeling instead of faith and Satan
[41:29] like to work on the feeling he like to
[41:31] work on these five senses Hallelujah the
[41:33] five outer senses and the five inner
[41:35] senses Hallelujah he will try to get up
[41:37] you with memory reasoning and conscience
[41:40] Hallelujah and all these different
[41:41] things but saints of God the True
[41:44] Believer we don't go on reasoning we
[41:45] don't go on memory we go in believing
[41:48] what the word of God tells us hallelujah
[41:51] because all things are possible to him
[41:52] that believeth because we cannot reason
[41:54] against the enemy and every every time
[41:56] something happen we'll try to reason and
[41:58] then it will bring up memory it will
[42:00] bring up feelings and all these things
[42:02] that is why the old man has to die out
[42:04] Hallelujah and you need to be separated
[42:06] from the world and the things of the
[42:08] world and coming into Christ Jesus in
[42:10] fullness Hallelujah in a message the
[42:14] power of transformation 65 10:31 M
[42:18] paragraph 77 he says sometimes you have
[42:21] to separate from everything that's dear
[42:25] on Earth
[42:26] he says to you to take your position
[42:29] that God has called you to this is very
[42:32] hard it's a hard say yes that sometimes
[42:37] you have to separate from everything
[42:39] that's dear on Earth to you to take your
[42:42] position that God has called you amen he
[42:46] says I'm sure you can read between the
[42:48] lines that's what I'm saying see
[42:51] sometimes the very dearest person on
[42:53] Earth you have to shake hands with them
[42:56] just take your position in Christ
[43:00] Hallelujah to where God has called you
[43:02] see but what is God doing he's
[43:07] transforming you from what you was
[43:11] maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it
[43:14] is
[43:15] from a lovely family sometimes he places
[43:19] you somewhere else because it's his way
[43:22] of doing it see by the renewing of your
[43:25] mind to obey the word of God Amen and he
[43:29] didn't stop there he says regardless of
[43:31] what the price is amen a lot of people
[43:34] want to have good things they want to
[43:36] have nice things they want to have
[43:38] expensive things but they're not willing
[43:40] to pay the price amen hallelujah how
[43:42] many you willing to pay the price this
[43:44] evening to serve God in the right way to
[43:47] separate yourself from every feeling
[43:49] from every thought Hallelujah to have
[43:50] the faith of God remember God called us
[43:53] to be sons of Abraham and we have that
[43:55] abrahamic Faith Hallelujah to be
[43:57] separated from everything Hallelujah
[43:59] that is contrary to the promise of God
[44:01] word and we see the season that we
[44:04] living in Hallelujah is that that same
[44:06] season is here again where the promise
[44:08] was fulfilled then hallelujah and it's
[44:10] being fulfilled now Hallelujah and we
[44:12] are the we are in the time of the very
[44:14] manifestation of the fullness of the
[44:16] word of God because the word tells us
[44:19] that when the seventh angel shall begin
[44:21] to song all the mystery of God shall be
[44:23] finished amen hallelujah and we come to
[44:25] realize there no new revelation upon the
[44:27] face of the Earth Hallelujah all what is
[44:30] required of us is already given
[44:32] Hallelujah but the only problem is that
[44:34] some of us we haven't gone into that
[44:36] place yet is how you can surrender
[44:38] yourself to the word of God hallelujah
[44:40] and the word of God can come and be
[44:42] manifested inside of you amen hallelujah
[44:45] so that is why be recognized the time
[44:47] and season that we living in regardless
[44:50] of what the price is if you're willing
[44:52] to pay the price saints of God then
[44:54] you'll wear the Crum with him him you
[44:56] know we normally would say that you know
[44:58] if you have a a a little battle you'll
[45:01] have a little V Victory Hallelujah if
[45:04] you have a big battle you expect a big
[45:06] victory but if you don't have no battles
[45:08] how are you going to expect victories in
[45:10] your life you see God didn't call us to
[45:12] be cowards but God call us to be Mighty
[45:15] Gentile Warriors because he knew that we
[45:18] have an enemy Hallelujah and the enemy
[45:21] want to project himself as God
[45:24] hallelujah he want to rise above the
[45:26] most high but we come to recognize today
[45:29] Hallelujah that no devil in hell can't
[45:31] stop a true predestinated seed of God
[45:34] hallelujah praise God from living the
[45:36] way that God would have him to live amen
[45:39] hallelujah we got to stay in the
[45:41] presence of God we know the Bible tells
[45:43] us in Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not
[45:45] against flesh and blood Hallelujah but
[45:47] against principalities and against
[45:50] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[45:52] this world against spiritual wickedness
[45:55] in high places wherefore take on the
[45:58] whole arm of God that he may be able to
[46:01] withstand in the evil day and having
[46:03] done all to stand Paul said when you
[46:05] stand
[46:06] make sure that you stand and stand it's
[46:09] a double shorty that where you standing
[46:12] and saints of God we come to recognize
[46:14] that we truly believe that this message
[46:16] is a Vindicated message amen hallelujah
[46:19] praise God and it doesn't matter what
[46:21] people say you know what it is because
[46:23] it's a life that is worthy of this God
[46:25] gospel Hallelujah we living in a time
[46:28] and season when there are so many things
[46:30] are happening and when we come to Eliz
[46:32] in the time of the children of Israel
[46:34] when God had brought them out from the
[46:35] land of Egypt praise God many of them
[46:38] were under the ministry of Moses and
[46:40] when they came out from the land of
[46:41] Egypt some they stood with Moses and
[46:44] some of them cor and dayon they were
[46:46] pointing them back into Egypt and there
[46:48] were some Hallelujah they were murmuring
[46:50] at the Wayside and it's the very same
[46:52] thing you're happening today because we
[46:54] are in an exod in a journey and we are
[46:56] in the final stage of the journey
[46:59] Hallelujah but we want to thank God for
[47:01] this final stage Hallelujah do you know
[47:03] that we are finalists amen hallelujah
[47:07] and God keeps the best for the last
[47:12] and there is where you have all the
[47:13] tricks there's where you have all all
[47:15] the big games all the big betting and
[47:17] everything that is happening but saints
[47:19] of God God is not betting on us he knows
[47:22] Hallelujah he knows what he placed there
[47:26] Hallelujah than you Lord and there's no
[47:28] devil in hell that can stop the bride of
[47:30] Christ Jesus the proud of God says
[47:32] nothing is out of cater with the bride
[47:35] sir because the bride have his mind and
[47:38] she know exactly what to do with the
[47:40] word because she has been separated from
[47:42] the world and the things of the world
[47:44] Hallelujah separated from church reality
[47:47] separated from so many things and coming
[47:49] into Christ Jesus saints of God we come
[47:51] to realize many people will wake up one
[47:54] morning to just recognize that they just
[47:56] have a message concept this message is
[47:59] not a concept this message is a reality
[48:02] this message is God to us and because
[48:05] people have a concept it can change but
[48:07] when you have a true Revelation from God
[48:09] it cannot change Hallelujah so Jesus
[48:12] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[48:14] forever we got to separate ourselves
[48:16] from every humanistic idea from every
[48:19] concept Hallelujah from whatever we
[48:21] think and whatever man is saying and get
[48:23] to this unadulterated word of God Amen
[48:26] because this word of God is ordained to
[48:28] see us through amen hallelujah many
[48:31] times people feel that we can preserve

[53:06] tonight
[53:07] Hallelujah the time come that when the
[53:10] when these Hebrew boys had to seal their

[53:49] times hotter than it ever was heat and
[53:52] we'll burn that out of them you cannot
[53:56] burn out Holy Ghost Fire

[54:03] world saints of God are they not the
[54:07] same Fate
[54:09] The Same Spirit that was in shedrach
[54:11] mishak and abedo is here tonight

[54:49] that dwell on the face of the whole
[54:51] earth watch ye therefore and pray always
[54:55] that he may be accounted worthy to
[54:57] escape all these things Hallelujah that
[55:01] shall that shall come to pass and to
[55:03] stand before the son of man how can we
[55:07] withstand these things we need the Life
[55:10] of Christ we need to have a true genuine
[55:14] Hallelujah experience of the baptism of
[55:16] the Holy Ghost in our life not just a
[55:19] message concept A lot of time people go
[55:22] well I'm 20 year in a message I'm 30
[55:24] year in a message
[55:27] when Paul came in his time there are
[55:29] many who believed but he says since you
[55:32] believe have you receiv received and
[55:35] when you when you preach about these
[55:36] things today people say you're crazy
[55:38] you're contrary what you want to do
[55:41] they call you Pentecostal yes sir
[55:44] Pentecost is an experience and because
[55:47] they don't have an experience with God
[55:48] that is why they just live in the
[55:50] intellect
[55:53] and if you live in an intellectual realm
[55:54] then Trouble Comes Satan can always get
[55:57] you amen hallelujah but if you live by
[55:59] the leadership of the Holy Spirit God
[56:02] inside of you there's no devil in hell
[56:04] that can stop you there's no demon in
[56:06] Hell Hallelujah that can get at you
[56:09] hallelujah what a time what a season
[56:12] that we are living in Hallelujah the
[56:15] proud of God tells Christ The Mystery of
[56:16] God revealed paragraph 187 he was giving
[56:20] us a little thing here about Adam he
[56:22] said how did he what happened in the
[56:23] prefigure
[56:25] he opened Adam's sight and took part of
[56:28] his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the
[56:31] Bible has to be the word for he is the
[56:33] word she cannot stand on Creeds she
[56:36] cannot stand on denomination she cannot
[56:39] stand on good behavior she has to stand
[56:43] alone on the word because she is part of
[56:46] it she was taken from Christ amen that
[56:49] is where we have to stand the bride has
[56:52] to be the word for he is the word
[56:55] yes amen so for us to be the word we got
[56:58] to be separated from every condition we
[57:01] got to be separated from a message
[57:03] concept and come into the reality of
[57:06] this messag
[57:08] Hallelujah because you find that back
[57:11] home some folks may tell you and they're
[57:13] so proud that they're in the message
[57:17] but they tell you well my grandmother
[57:19] used to come to church and my
[57:21] grandfather and my mother and my dad and
[57:23] everybody and now I come to this church
[57:25] but they don't have an experience
[57:28] with God that is why you see so many
[57:30] things happening it doesn't matter how
[57:32] good children we have and how good
[57:35] parents we are
[57:37] we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:39] amen hallelujah we come to realize it's
[57:43] not just the children delinquency as the
[57:45] prod of God says it's also parent
[57:47] delinquency
[57:50] because if you don't have the true
[57:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost how would you
[57:53] live a life before your family
[57:55] how would you stand to minister the word
[57:57] of God it takes the Life of Christ in
[57:59] you saints of God this world is full of
[58:01] trouble the God of this evil age is
[58:03] getting our grips upon people amen
[58:06] hallelujah amen
[58:10] and not on the outside right within the
[58:11] framework of the church on Amen you know
[58:17] if the devil is not after you then he's
[58:19] got you ready amen you got to thank God
[58:23] when the devil is after you and you have
[58:25] all these trials and these battles
[58:27] when you have these persecutions and
[58:29] trials in your life because the proud of
[58:31] God said God is allowing you giving you
[58:33] an opportunity that you can have
[58:35] victories in your life amen thank you
[58:38] Lord because he wants us to be
[58:39] Overcomers and only Overcomers can reign
[58:42] with him only Overcomers can make it
[58:44] there so God want us to overcome
[58:47] Hallelujah and God want us that we can
[58:50] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[58:52] his life amen hallelujah and he is more
[58:54] willing to give it to us and how we want
[58:56] it
[58:57] just think of it how much God love us
[59:00] and he wants us to be like him but the
[59:02] greatest hindrance huah is not a pastor
[59:05] the brother next to you or the Deacon or
[59:07] the song leader somebody but the
[59:09] greatest hindrance is me I myself amen
[59:12] Allelujah when it comes of us receiving
[59:15] the word of God saints of God we got to
[59:17] separate ourselves by the word of God
[59:20] with from our feelings with our faith
[59:22] amen hallelujah because this message
[59:24] this gospel it stands in a power and a
[59:27] demonstration of the holy spirit amen
[59:29] it's not how good we feel that we are as
[59:32] a part of God says is not a good
[59:34] behavior
[59:37] but it's standing on the word of God
[59:40] because all that good behavior many who
[59:42] who could have outlive or live a
[59:44] righteous life more than the scribes and
[59:46] the Pharisees amen and Christ Jesus said
[59:49] that if your righteousness cannot exceed
[59:51] them you can't make it but that
[59:55] righteousness that he was talking about
[59:56] saints of God was not a man's
[59:58] righteousness it was the righteousness
[1:00:00] of Christ Jesus because man's
[1:00:03] righteousness don't put you nowhere
[1:00:05] man's righteousness is your
[1:00:06] self-righteous that you feel you're
[1:00:08] righteous more than anybody else and you
[1:00:10] feel that you better more than anybody
[1:00:12] else well this message don't have no
[1:00:14] personality and anybody around the
[1:00:15] message want to have a personality well
[1:00:19] it's a difficult position amen because
[1:00:21] you cannot take the position of Christ
[1:00:23] amen hallelujah because he's the same
[1:00:25] yesterday today and forever he's the
[1:00:27] king of kings he is the Lord of lords
[1:00:30] Hallelujah and we truly want to thank
[1:00:32] God for his grace and his love and mercy
[1:00:35] so the bride has to be the word for he
[1:00:39] is the word she cannot stand on Creed
[1:00:41] she cannot stand on denomination she
[1:00:43] cannot stand on good behavior she has to
[1:00:46] stand alone on the word because she is
[1:00:49] part of it and she was taken from Christ
[1:00:52] yes amen amen Paul says to me to live is
[1:00:56] Christ
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] so what are we living on
[1:01:03] what are we living for
[1:01:05] is because of the grace of God in our
[1:01:08] life that we can come that way in
[1:01:11] Genesis
[1:01:13] okay let me read this code just before I
[1:01:15] go to the scripture
[1:01:17] the proud of God was telling here in a
[1:01:19] message my new ministry paragraph e95 he
[1:01:22] says now listen to this God God has so
[1:01:25] arranged it that his program cannot move
[1:01:28] without you and I
[1:01:31] God have it this way that is why we need
[1:01:33] a separation from the world and the
[1:01:35] things of the world away from religion
[1:01:38] away from every concept
[1:01:40] God has so arranged it this program
[1:01:44] cannot move without you and I and as
[1:01:46] long as we are not doing what God lead
[1:01:50] us to do we are paralyzing his Pro
[1:01:54] program but when the church moves by the
[1:01:58] anointing of the Holy Ghost amen then we
[1:02:01] are in God's will doing his program
[1:02:05] hallelujah amen it's not my will but his
[1:02:10] will be done Christ Jesus here on Earth
[1:02:13] hallelujah hallelujah going to the
[1:02:16] Garden of get enem me coming to his time
[1:02:20] where you have to fulfill hallelujah
[1:02:22] what he was being sent for humanly when
[1:02:26] he feel the pangs and the pain he says
[1:02:29] father
[1:02:30] let this cup
[1:02:32] pass from me that was the human feelings
[1:02:37] but when he realized his position he
[1:02:39] said Lord nevertheless
[1:02:41] not my will Lord but your will be done
[1:02:45] and since of every true son and daughter
[1:02:48] of God has to come to that Amen to
[1:02:52] separate your feelings from your faith
[1:02:55] when it comes to this word of God if we
[1:02:59] don't do that we're paralyzing his
[1:03:01] program but when the church moves by the
[1:03:04] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are
[1:03:06] in God's will doing his program amen we
[1:03:10] want to be in God's will doing his
[1:03:12] program not a man mating amen hallelujah
[1:03:16] one time the proud of God was saying I
[1:03:17] can't remember the exact message but he
[1:03:20] was talking about Peter he says Peter
[1:03:22] wasn't called to serve the ministry he
[1:03:24] was called to serve God and many time we
[1:03:27] feel well you know it's the church and
[1:03:28] it's the Ministries and we and we have
[1:03:30] no committed life to our Heavenly Father
[1:03:34] we must have a committed life it's not
[1:03:36] just coming to church and and what we
[1:03:38] doing becomes a ritual God don't believe
[1:03:40] in ritual whatever we do it got to come
[1:03:43] from the heart it got to come from Deep
[1:03:45] with inside of us because it's part of
[1:03:49] us hallelujah
[1:03:53] what a time of what a season that we are
[1:03:55] living in saints of God it's a Down to
[1:03:58] Earth time hallelujah praise His
[1:04:01] wonderful name
[1:04:08] in Genesis chapter 339 just a little
[1:04:10] reference here he said it was between
[1:04:13] Abraham and lot where they had this
[1:04:15] separation he said is not the whole land
[1:04:17] before thee separate thyself I pray thee
[1:04:20] from me if thou will take the left hand
[1:04:22] then I will go to the right or if thou
[1:04:24] depart from the right hand then I will
[1:04:26] go to the left it was between Abraham
[1:04:30] and lot one was a carnal-minded Believer
[1:04:34] Hallelujah and the other was truly
[1:04:35] elected and called of God and the one
[1:04:38] that was being called and elected of God
[1:04:40] he gave the other one to make the choice
[1:04:44] that's what God always does
[1:04:47] he have his he have his way and he said
[1:04:50] this is the way walking it Hallelujah
[1:04:52] but then people want to take a
[1:04:53] permissive will
[1:04:54] but true Sons and Daughters of God will
[1:04:57] never want to get into a permissive will
[1:05:01] they will want to be in a perfect and
[1:05:03] acceptable will of God in separating
[1:05:05] don't matter what the price you have to
[1:05:07] pay lot was just looking at a final
[1:05:10] Pastor he was looking of how rich he
[1:05:12] will become because of the grass land
[1:05:14] and the cattle that he'll be having but
[1:05:16] Abraham was not looking beneath he was
[1:05:18] looking aboveall Hallelujah that he
[1:05:21] called him to be a father of many nation
[1:05:23] that he will receive a blessing so we're
[1:05:25] not looking at what we can achieve now
[1:05:28] and what we could have and want to be
[1:05:30] smart God call us to be smart God call
[1:05:33] us to be honest God call us to be
[1:05:36] righteous God call us to be holy
[1:05:39] Hallelujah God call us to be Sons and
[1:05:40] Daughters to be obedient to his word and
[1:05:43] when we can be that way in his provided
[1:05:45] way saints of God everything God will
[1:05:48] give to us hallelujah in a message proof
[1:05:51] of his resurrection paragraph 71

[1:06:03] have on your side it's not the multitude
[1:06:06] having on your side many time people
[1:06:08] feel the multitude is right but you
[1:06:10] don't go by the multitude when you look
[1:06:12] through the scripture most of the time
[1:06:14] or all the time the multitude is always
[1:06:16] wrong amen but because they are big in
[1:06:18] numbers they seem to be powerful
[1:06:23] but God is not in numbers Hallelujah God
[1:06:26] is in Revelation
[1:06:28] and if we had to stand it alone stand it
[1:06:30] for it's God's word every man that ever

[1:10:27] God
[1:10:28] you don't dispute the word of God you
[1:10:30] just believe the word of God Abraham
[1:10:33] never disputed God Abraham came and
[1:10:35] Abraham just believed what the word of
[1:10:38] God was saying hallelujah in a message
[1:10:41] he saw by himself paragraph 207 he says
[1:10:44] God by Sovereign election has called
[1:10:46] Abraham's seed yes amen then if that
[1:10:51] type of life that was on inside of that
[1:10:54] blood cell was upon Abraham
[1:10:58] who called the impossible possible
[1:11:00] called The Impossibles that they would
[1:11:03] be because God said so what kind of
[1:11:06] people are the Seed of Abraham amen
[1:11:09] Abraham was a separated man
[1:11:12] from his home from his from his Kindred
[1:11:15] and he came out a land that God would
[1:11:17] show unto him hallelujah praise God it's
[1:11:20] not that Abraham didn't have any
[1:11:21] feelings it's not that we don't have any
[1:11:23] feelings tonight but saints of God we
[1:11:25] have to separate between our feelings
[1:11:27] from our faith amen hallelujah praise
[1:11:30] God so what kind of people are the Seed
[1:11:33] of Abraham he says oh don't miss this

[1:11:41] then if you are Abraham's seed you can't
[1:11:44] dispute with God am amen Abraham's seed
[1:11:48] is a part of this spirit for God gave
[1:11:51] Abraham a sign of circumcision cutting
[1:11:54] off the flesh
[1:11:56] cutting off the flesh so saints of God
[1:11:58] when the Holy Ghost comes inside of you
[1:12:00] it's a circumcision it cuts off all The
[1:12:03] Unwanted flesh it cuts off everything
[1:12:06] that is not worthy of this gospel and
[1:12:09] anything that is not worthy of this
[1:12:10] gospel it is a hard saying it could be
[1:12:13] your wife your husband your your boss
[1:12:15] your or whoever it is hallelujah it will
[1:12:18] have to go and you will stand on the
[1:12:21] word of God hallelujah praise is
[1:12:23] wonderful name then if you are Abraham's
[1:12:25] seed you can't dispute with God
[1:12:27] Abraham's seed is a part of the spirit
[1:12:29] for God gave Abraham a sign of
[1:12:32] circumcision cutting off the flesh for a
[1:12:34] witness he had received him amen
[1:12:38] hallelujah listen to this now in this
[1:12:41] last days has took the Holy Ghost and
[1:12:45] circumcised
[1:12:46] every believer yes of cutting off all
[1:12:50] doubts and unbelief Amen to believe
[1:12:52] God's word word is pure and holy and is
[1:12:56] the truth
[1:12:58] hallelujah circumcision cutting away all
[1:13:01] unbelief everything Cut Loose every
[1:13:04] shore line saying God I believe you live
[1:13:07] or die sink or drunk it's your word I
[1:13:10] believe amen then see what I mean amen
[1:13:15] amen hallelujah what a season that we
[1:13:17] are living in stay with this word no
[1:13:20] matter what it it costs you amen
[1:13:25] Hallelujah whatever it takes I I
[1:13:28] remember one time I think it was in
[1:13:35] 1997
[1:13:37] I had tree services that day
[1:13:41] and after the first service the Lord
[1:13:43] tremendously blessed and coming out in
[1:13:47] the in the room I said God whatever it
[1:13:51] takes for me to draw draw closer to you
[1:13:54] to be what You' have me to be Lord let
[1:13:55] me be whatever it takes without no
[1:13:58] consideration just because of how I felt
[1:14:01] and brother
[1:14:03] when I was going to preach in the second
[1:14:05] service I get in a head-on collision
[1:14:08] with a pickup truck and I was driving my
[1:14:10] van
[1:14:12] and he came up a one way and I had no
[1:14:14] way to escape the only way I the I the
[1:14:18] wind screen from the vehicle was broken
[1:14:20] I I had to blow the suit on the show
[1:14:23] shoulder hit on and I came out of the
[1:14:25] vehicle
[1:14:27] but then the doors all the seat was
[1:14:31] pushed right up to the roof I was out of
[1:14:33] that vehicle so some persons were
[1:14:36] passing say who was driving that vehicle
[1:14:39] I said look the look the fellow standing
[1:14:41] down there the vehicle right it was
[1:14:44] written off you know I feel the pain of
[1:14:47] everything
[1:14:48] so and the first thought came to me on
[1:14:50] whatever it takes
[1:14:53] amen that is how it is many time we say
[1:14:56] things but do we really mean did I
[1:14:58] really I didn't really mean in that way
[1:15:00] but I say Lord whatever it takes
[1:15:06] so there that is why we have to be
[1:15:07] careful
[1:15:09] of what we say with the words that we'll
[1:15:11] use because in our Zeal we can say
[1:15:14] things and do things and God will take
[1:15:17] us at our word hallelujah and when we
[1:15:19] don't really mean it we we we'll pay for
[1:15:21] the whole thing but then realize that
[1:15:24] you know you said it well Lord I really
[1:15:26] mean what I said so any True Believer
[1:15:28] when you come to realize the seriousness
[1:15:32] of the word of God hallelujah you'll
[1:15:34] want to cut loose everything of this
[1:15:36] world and to serve God in the way that
[1:15:39] he will have you to saints of God I want
[1:15:41] to tell you this evening let our
[1:15:43] conviction be upon the word of God
[1:15:48] finally 2 Corinthians 6:17 tells us
[1:15:52] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:15:54] be separated said the Lord and touch not
[1:15:56] the unclean thing that I will receive
[1:15:58] you so it's separation tonight by the
[1:16:03] grace of God separating yourself between
[1:16:05] your feelings and your faith just think
[1:16:07] about this thought Hallelujah and see
[1:16:10] the way how God would have us to be amen
[1:16:13] it's a total separation amen so saints
[1:16:16] of God you know let us continue serving
[1:16:19] God the way that he will have of us
[1:16:22] because we come to realize this message
[1:16:25] is not a big show but I want to let you
[1:16:28] know there's a big Showdown
[1:16:31] Hallelujah there is a big Showdown sir
[1:16:33] and God is preparing his bride he's
[1:16:36] preparing a people that is willing for
[1:16:39] that great and final showdown so
[1:16:42] separate yourself between your feeling
[1:16:44] and your faith and let God have his way
[1:16:47] may God richly bless you Hallelujah
[1:16:51] Lord Jesus
