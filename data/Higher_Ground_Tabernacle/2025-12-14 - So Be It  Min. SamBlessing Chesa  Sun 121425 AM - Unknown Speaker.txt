We have submitted ourselves to you and we not expecting to hear from a man, but we're expecting to hear from you. God. I pray oh Lord that you speak through the speaker and hear through the hearer so that in the end of it all we'll be able to say our heart our hearts did burn within us as he was speaking to us and we have received our heart's desire and the mighty uncontested name of Jesus Christ. We pray believing and say amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Happy to be in the house of the Lord. Good to see each and everyone was able to press through the cold to come into the house of the Lord. I believe that there's a special blessing that's waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we have believed a a message that has benefits &gt;&gt; and the Bible says he has daily loaded us with benefits. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have to step up and claim those benefits because they are yours. Um whilst we are studying let us open our Bibles to the book of Luke in chapter one starting from verse 26. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, &gt;&gt; to a virgin espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. &gt;&gt; And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." Verse 29 reads, "And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying and cussed in her mind what manner of salutation this shall be. For thou has found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, &gt;&gt; and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus, &gt;&gt; he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. Verse 34. And then said to Mary unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her, who was called Baron. For with God nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." And the angel departed from her. Amen. May the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word. We may take our seats. Amen. This uh this morning I want to speak um on a subject I don't intend to be too long. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on so be it. &gt;&gt; So be it. In the Bible where we read, &gt;&gt; God sent the angel Gabriel &gt;&gt; to Mary with news, &gt;&gt; with an announcement. The prophet of God says, "Every time you see Gabriel on the earth, it means that there is a major announcement that's about to be made." Amen. And he came with news that was absurd. Something that had never ever happened before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this was a fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah that a virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet of God tells us &gt;&gt; that Mary was walking prior in that week. She was walking from the synagogue meditating upon that prophecy. And she was thinking, "How is this possible that a virgin, someone who has not known a man will conceive? Little did she know that God was conditioning her &gt;&gt; to receive the promise. God was conditioning her for her to be a candidate of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it does not matter how much something seems impossible, you have to believe it anyways because it is not up to you to make it come to passons. &gt;&gt; But it is God's word, the promise itself that will condition you to be able to receive it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why when she heard this, she said, "I know it has never happened before, and I don't know how it's going to happen, but nevertheless, according to your word, let it be unto me. Hallelujah." In other words, she said, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amens, so be it. Amen is usually a response &gt;&gt; that someone gives after an utterance has been made and you are saying to that utterance as that utterance has mentioned let it be unto me. So when you are seated there and you are saying amen, it is not a word that you are just repeating. But if you are believing it within your heart, &gt;&gt; then you are saying Lord whatever you have said about the word let it be unto me as you have said it. I don't care how it's going to come. I'm not worried about how impossible the circumstance look like. All I know is it is going to happen because your word has said so. You remember Abraham and Sarah, they were given a promise that you were going to receive a child. Sarah had two things working against her. when she was barren. &gt;&gt; Baron people don't have kids. She was old and old people don't have kids. So it was a double impossibility to herossibility. But because the word came from God, Abraham believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham believed it and he said, "I know it is going to happen. How? I don't know. When I don't know, but I am going to believe it." And look, the promise that was given to Abraham and Sarah is the one that rejuvenated them. We know through the reading of the message that they were made young again. That's why the king of Egypt was lusting after Sarah. Why? Because she had become young again. What made her young again? It is the promise of God. It was conditioning her preparing them so they could receive that promise of God. They did not go to some hospital for some rejuvenation, for some it was the word of God that did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So if God gives you a promise, if the word of God tells you something, if you cannot do it and you don't have the capability, do not worry about that because it is not up to you to make it happen to you. It is the word of God. If the word of God said you shall be raptured, don't worry about how that's going to happen. But the word itself has enough power to transform this body to get out of this place. I'm just resting on that word because I know it has never ever failed. So whenever you hear the word of God, your response should be amen. Amen. Your response should be let it be unto me according to thy word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And for you to be able to receive that word, &gt;&gt; you need faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because faith is the only thing that does not disbelieve the word of God. And without faith, it is impossible to please God. But when you have that faith, you know, the Bible says, "If you have faith such as a grain of a mustard seed, &gt;&gt; and if you shall say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; be thou moved and be cast into the sea, that mountain has to go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You should not start worrying about how is how is how are you going to get the bulldozers to come and break down that mountain. The word of God has enough power to take it down. Hallelujah. Because it is the word of God. If we look at Hebrews chapter 11 and verse one, if you can pull up the slides, please. The Bible says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen." I went to the Amplified Bible and this is what it says. Now faith is the assurance, the confirmation, the title deed. of things we hope for. &gt;&gt; Being the proof &gt;&gt; of things we do not see &gt;&gt; and the conviction of their reh reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Faith is an assurance. It is a title deed. It is not an I think so. But it is an I know so because you are not looking at the impossibility of things. You are looking at the word of God. You are looking at God himself. Remember the Bible says now faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you hear that word and the word that you are hearing is what is going to become the faith. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When you hear the word of God, it is going to come into you and remember in the soul there can only either be faith or doubt. So hearing the faith, hearing the word is going to convert that word into being faith in your soul. And that faith is God. Because your soul can only be God or Satan. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why faith is immovable. &gt;&gt; So Mary believed the word that she heard because she had faith knowing that whatever God said, it is going to come to pass in believers. Without this, the prophet of God said, &gt;&gt; "She didn't wait till she felt life." If you can go to the next slide, please. She didn't wait till she felt life. She started right then testifying &gt;&gt; that she was going to have a baby. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As soon as God's word sinks in your heart, get up and give a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do not wait for anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Next slide. When God takes the Holy Spirit and brings that word to you &gt;&gt; and makes it alive to you, That's a reality. That's your faith. Stand up and claim it. You don't have to feel nothing. You don't have to see nothing. You have to believe something. I'm not amening myself. But it means so be it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God also said, &gt;&gt; "As soon as Mary said, let it be unto me according to thy word," that's when conception took place. Wasn't going by what she was feeling. She wasn't going she wasn't waiting for a pregnancy test, &gt;&gt; but she knew that the word of God had already brought that conception and immediately she ran to her cousin Elizabeth and she was already testifying, I shall have a baby. I shall name him Jesus. Elizabeth had been once she had that conception. &gt;&gt; Elizabeth wasn't testifying. Elizabeth, the Bible say she hid for five months. &gt;&gt; And she only started coming out after the sixth month. But Mary was not like that. She says, "All I need is a word. I don't need to see the baby bump. I don't need to start craving for things that I don't usually don't crave for. But I know God's word. It is enough for me. Hallelujah. Brother, sister, you don't need anything else today. All you need is the word of God. Once you hear it in your ears of faith, your response should be amen. &gt;&gt; And once you say amen, &gt;&gt; that word will start working on you. It will in fact it will start conditioning you to receive the promise of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Ephesians 5 27, it says that he might present himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, &gt;&gt; but that it should be holy and without blemish. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am in the church of God this morning. I do not know how that is going to happen because no human is perfect. But I know the word says I am going to be uh I'm going to be glorious &gt;&gt; with no spot, &gt;&gt; no wrinkle and without any blemish. All I have to say is amen, I believe it is going to happen to you. As soon as I say amen, that exact word is going to start working on me. That's why you should always listen to the Bible. Read your Bible. Listen to the word. Amen. When the prophet was asked, "What shall I do to for me to uh what what should I do for me to make into the rapture?" &gt;&gt; You say, "Read your Bible and pray every day." Why? Because that word has enough power to change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so once you start eating it, remember they say you become what you eat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Mary was carrying the word but we have the privilege of not just carrying it. We are supposed to become the word itself. And the more you feast on that word, you start working on you. You start growing and you start looking at your reflection of yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because you become what you eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So brother, sister, whenever you hear the word of God, your response should be yes and no. Because that word is responsible to transform you and to make you to be able to receive the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't wait or listen to Satan because Satan works on your five senses. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I've been healed," &gt;&gt; but you still you still feel pain. If you listen to your if you listen to your uh senses of feeling you are going to get that healing to go because you are doubting. The word does not say where where there is doubt. Remember the theme of the prophet's uh ministry was only believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Believing &gt;&gt; when you start believing you are creating an atmosphere around you at you are creating an atmosphere in your life atmosphere that can allow God to work in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't wait. Don't wait for you to see the evidence. You just start believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In I'm the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says soon as you hear the word of God that says you can be set free, he says believe it. Rejoice with it. Look at this. It says God will show the evidence after you have accepted it. &gt;&gt; But first you accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to receive your salvation. Accept it first and you will see the evidence later on. If you want the Holy Ghost, believe that you already have it and you will see God touching your life. You will see God changing your life. What you just have to do is first accept it. Christ died for sinners. I believe it. I accept it. &gt;&gt; And I start rejoicing. &gt;&gt; God works righteousness by it. Amen. I believe he was striped for my healing. I believe it. I accept it. &gt;&gt; God's working healings in me. Just as soon as I believe it, he can't help me till I believe it. I've got to believe and confess it first and then look at this and then God's under obligation. &gt;&gt; Obligation means you don't have an option. Obligation means you have to do it. You believe it &gt;&gt; and then you confess it. &gt;&gt; God has no other choice but to make it happen because that's his word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he has never ever failed. There's only one thing that binds God. God is bound by his word. Hallelujah. If you come and you cry, you cry all night. Amen. And you are praying for something. God has a choice &gt;&gt; to either give it to you or not because remember he's sovereign. He does whatever he wants whenever he wants. So when you come, you can kneel here 48 hours and cry all your tears out. Nothing wrong with it. &gt;&gt; But God will either do it whenever he wants to. So don't depend or rely on your tears because he can still either do it or not. But if you hold him to his word, and say Lord but you say this he has no other choice because he is bound by his word. Hallelujah. So that's why you have to confess it and believe it. Once you believe it then he is obligated to give it to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you want the Holy Ghost, the Bible says, "Repent and be baptized. You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." If you do what the Bible is telling you, God has no option. He has to give it to you. Because that's what his word says. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His word says, "By his stripes, I was healed." So you stand there and you say, "Lord, I know you already healed me 2,000 years ago. Just give me enough grace to come and catch it because he has already done it for you. He's not going to start healing you today because he has already finished it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So accept it first and then you will see the evidence later." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you hear his word, say, Lord, &gt;&gt; let it be unto me according to your word. Just like Mary of old, &gt;&gt; I don't just want to carry the word. I want to become the word and that word who start working in you. And do not wait for don't don't wait for you to see anything first. Just believe because she heard from an angel. And an angel does not speak his own words. &gt;&gt; An angel does not speak his own words. An angel, he is just a messenger. He says what is just sent by God. So when you hear from an angel, you can say, "I have heard from God." When an angel visits you, you can say, "I've been visited by God." So when you are listening to the message, you are hearing from God. And when you believe the message of the hour for your day, it will start working on you. Amen. Amen. Don't wait for you to see the results. Just believe it. and God will start working in your life. God gave the children of Israel a promise. He says, "I am going to deliver you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And uh the prophet of God says, "And when the children of Israel was led out of Egypt, God promised to take care of them as they journeyed through the wilderness." God said he will take care of them. &gt;&gt; And he did do it. &gt;&gt; No matter where the path led, &gt;&gt; any enemy, &gt;&gt; God in God's path, it gave way. Why? Because he had given a word going to keep them. So there was no Pharaoh's army. There's no enemy &gt;&gt; that could stand in their way because they under a commission from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet of God says, I can see them come up to the Red Sea. He says, God had his map drawn out where he was going to take them. They will move right up to the Red Sea. no way at all to cross it. You know the story when they were leaving out of Egypt. They did not know where they were going. They were just following the pillar of fire by night and the cloud by day. And when they got to the Red Sea, they have the Red Sea in front of them and they have the Pharaoh's army coming from behind. They did not even know how they were going to get across. But because Moses, he knew the God he had met in the burning place and he showed him that he could never fail. That's where we we have the saying between standing between a rock and a hard place. I don't know if that translates, but that's where the statement came from. They're standing between a rock and a hard place. &gt;&gt; They have mountains out by the way. They have a Red Sea in front of them and Pharaoh's army pursuing after them. He says he was Pharaoh's army, the mountains on one side, Pharaoh's army here and the Red Sea in front of him. &gt;&gt; Moses lifted up his hands. &gt;&gt; Psalm 72 said, "God looked down. He seen the that path laying through the bottom of the sea. There was his children right there needing the promise taking God at his word. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel did not know where they were going. Cuz all they could see was just the Red Sea. But God in his providence, he already knew under the Red Sea there was a path that was laying there. and he drove them with a pillar of fire and the crowd and he brought them to the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; They did not know of the path but he knew of the path that was laying right at the bottom. That's why you need to take God at his word. You don't know what's in front of you. You don't know how it's going to happen, but he knows exactly why he's bringing you to that red sea. He has a path that is predestinated and ordained for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Corinthians, it says, "There is no temptation that is uncommon to man, for in every temptation, there is an open door. You might not see the door. But the God who has allowed that temptation to come your way, he sees the door. Just take him at his word and he will open and show you the door. He brought the children of Israel to the Red Sea and he brought them right to the path that he had there for them and he was they were taking God at his word blindly following but Moses knew that God was going to make a way himself. Moses didn't even know about the path. But God knew that if you take God at his word, he's going to bring you to that path under the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; I like this. It says God looked down through that pit of fire and with angered eyes. And when he did, the sea got scared and moved back like that &gt;&gt; and it showed up the path that was laying under Israel walked through on dry ground. That's why you need to take that's why you need to take God at his word. Hallelujah. When he looked through that pillar of fire, that sea got scared and it had to run away and separate. Chemistry tells me that you can never have water in one body and it separate to go different pathways. But God is the one who created the water. And when the water saw the angry eyes of God, It had to open up &gt;&gt; a way for the children of Israel to come across. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, &gt;&gt; your problem, &gt;&gt; if God looks as if &gt;&gt; with angry eyes, &gt;&gt; that problem &gt;&gt; has no option than to run away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have a sickness, &gt;&gt; if God looks at it, angry eyes that sickness got to go. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word and say by his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; And when you look at it, &gt;&gt; it is going to go. You can say I have an addiction, something I've been struggling with for years. It does not matter what it is. When God looks at it with his eyes, when he looks at it with his angry eyes, amen, &gt;&gt; it got to go. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's what his word say. Take God at his word and he will open a way for you. You might not see it, but he knows why he is bringing you where you are. That's why the song says we will understand it better by and by the children of Israel had crossed and they started rejoicing. Miriam composed new songs. But just previously they were scared. But when they saw what God had done, they started jumping for joy and they sang new songs of praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what? &gt;&gt; They take God at his word. They took him at his word and says, "Amen. Let it be unto us. As you have said, you said we will be delivered." So I know we will be delivered. So take each and every promise that you want &gt;&gt; and take God at his word. You will open that way for you and of the three Hebrew boys. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were about to be thrown into fire. Look at this. When God when God opened the Red Sea, he did not send an angel. &gt;&gt; He did not send a wormwood. to say you are the to say you are you are the angel of uh you're the angel of floods &gt;&gt; go scare the red sea &gt;&gt; no he went himself he says I'mma look at it myself because my children are involved when it is you that is involved God takes personal responsibility hallelujah because that is his people. &gt;&gt; He's not going to leave your fate at someone's else's hand. Look at the three three Hebrew boys. When they were right there in the furnace, the prophet of God says, "There was a conference in heaven. Hallelujah." The angel started talking and say, "Lord, send me. Let me go." He says, "No, you are not going." &gt;&gt; Wormwood. The angel of flood came. and say, "Lord, you know what I did in the days of Noah? I'll go and flood up that furnace and that and they won't be burned." But God says, "No, no, no, no, no. That's not your job. My children are involved. They just took a stand for me. I need to go by myself." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So when Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego &gt;&gt; when they were going to that furry furnace, I do not know what chemical reaction happened there. &gt;&gt; All I know is God is the greatest chemist there. And he separated the heat from the fire just for the three Hebrew boys. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the chains that were binding them That fire burnt it away. And the men who were behind them, pushing them in the flames are the ones that got burnt. Hallelujah. They did a retent back to send the fire that the enemy had put. &gt;&gt; The same fire that burned the enemy. The same Red Sea that opened for the children of Israel is the same Red Sea that covered and drowned Pharaoh's army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you take God at his word, he is coming personally. If he did it for the children of Israel, I know he can do it for me. If he did it for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, I know he can do it for me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because when you take God at his word, that word is going to start working in your favor. What the enemy meant for evil, God has turned it around for my good, start believing it anyways. It's going to work later. I've already received. So today, if you have a heart desire, just claim it and believe it. and say and say I know it's already happened &gt;&gt; and walk away and go walk away and go and and you can sleep don't have sleepless nights and you can say I know I know it's coming later all I just had to do was believe &gt;&gt; hallelujah if you are praying for a particular you've been fasting for a particular thing, believe God at his word &gt;&gt; is going to follow later. &gt;&gt; We know of John Ryan. You know, we love to read the Old Testament to see what God has done, what he did for the for the children of Israel, for the three Hebrew boys, what he did for Daniel. And coming into the Old New Testament, what he did for Paul, releasing them from prison, but we don't serve a historical God. We serve a God that has history. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need to also know that God is something is doing something in my day cuz what is it going to help me if if if only if he only operated 2,000 years ago and he ended up. I need a God that is real. A God that can step out of the pages of the Bible. Remember that little boy who said, "I need a God that's got a skin on it. I need a God that I can touch, that I can feel, and I can see he's working day to day." Amen. Hallelujah. In our days, there is a man was called John Ryan. John Ryan. John Ryan went into the uh he went into the prayer line &gt;&gt; and he was a blind man and the prophet prayed for him and he told him that you shall see and he went. So John Ryan he probably didn't know too many things about about faith and believing and he went excited. He says the prophet prayed and he told me I am going to see. Remember thus says the Lord does not fail. And he went. &gt;&gt; Day one he's still blind. Day two he's still blind. Days keep on going. He's still blind. He's wondering but I've been prayed for. Then he goes back to the prophet &gt;&gt; and he says, "But I'm still blind and the prophet of God tell him just keep on believing." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold on to that. And when the prophet told him that and when he grasped that revelation that I'm taking God at his word, my eyes might not open right now, &gt;&gt; but I know it's going to happen. And he started going around and now he started telling everyone that he saw he's saying I can see &gt;&gt; extra extra I can see extra extra. &gt;&gt; He was selling newspapers wherever he was he's selling newspapers extra extra I can see. He started confessing it before he saw the evidence of it. He said so let it be unto me. according to thy word. &gt;&gt; My eyes might not open this exact moment, &gt;&gt; but I know one day, one day they are going to open. He's selling newspapers extra, extra I can see and people word got around town and they started mocking him. So he used to be just blind, but now he's blind and crazy. We all know he is blind. He cannot see. But why is he saying I can see? That did not stop him. The more they criticized, the more he went extra extra I can see. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then one day he decided to visit the barber shop and he sat in that barberhop chair and the barber the barber started shaving him. And he put him that he put that apron around him and he's shaving him and he's just testifying. I can see I can see and just when half of his head was shaved, his eyes opened. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because he was believing he did not wait for the Baba to remove the airrop. He got up out of the out of the barber chair and he stormed out running and he kept on saying, "I can see. I can see." That prophecy had been made manifest. Why? Because he took God at his word and God made it happen in his life and he went around with that apron flying around saying, "I can see. I can see." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is to show us that when you believe first those results will follow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look into the word. The word of God will show you exactly who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's called the mirror of the word. At one point in time, there was a man who was given a spoken word book and he started reading it and he came back to the person who gave him and he said, "This book that you just gave me, he told me that I'm a buzzer and he was not happy. He was mad at that book. He says, "That book called me I'm a buzzer." That friend was surprised. He said, "Oh, really? That same book you're talking about. Jesus told me that I am I'm an eagle." They were looking at the same thing, &gt;&gt; but they sold different things. So the word does not change who you are. It only shows you who you are and what you are supposed to become. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says it's showing you that you are an eagle but you a buzzard but it's showing me that I am an eagle. Hallelujah. And we know eagles fly high above all doubts above all things of the earth. It is the highest flying bird there is. And when it's hunting, it goes all the way up and look straight all the way down to what he wants to get. When an eagle is fighting, it does not fight on the earth. &gt;&gt; It takes its prey into the air, brings it to its territory. That's why when you are fighting the devil, don't fight the devil in his territory. Bring the fight back to the word. Take him. Take take that fight back into the height of the word. Because in your territory, that's where you have victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see an eagle, it will take a snake all the way up. and it will drop it and it will drop it right onto a rock and it will take it back up again. Drop it back onto the rock and by the time it's taken it up and down a few times. dizzy and discombobulated and you don't know what to do and then it's just an easy kill. Hallelujah. You take the enemy, bring him into the word, fight him in the word, fight with the word of God. Jesus did the same thing. Satan tried to fight him. All the power that Jesus had, he just used the word. He just said, "It is written, &gt;&gt; man shall not leave vibrator alone. It is written, &gt;&gt; thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, and he overcame. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we know we have the rock of ages. So take the enemy and drop him onto that rock. That rock defeated him before the foundation of the world. He fell down like a cloth. And on the resurrection day, that rock of ages overcame him, too. You take your enemy, hit him onto that rock of revelation, hit him onto that rock of ages, and he will be powerless before you. Amen. So take the fight. bring it into your territory &gt;&gt; and you will know you will win. If you want an angel to visit your home, &gt;&gt; you need to stay in the word. That's what Zechariah and Elizabeth did. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to go to that quote. The prophet of God says the angel the angel came to them because they were keeping the statutes of God in their house. I'll just get to it. And that angel came to a home that was a respected home. If you want angels to visit your home, be like Zachariah. &gt;&gt; Him and Sarah Elizabeth. Elizabeth was living upright before the Lord, keeping all the statutes and all the commandments of the Lord, &gt;&gt; living in perfect obedience to the word in the light that they have. So in your home, if you want angels to visit your home, live upright before the Lord, keep all the statutes and his commandments. &gt;&gt; You got to apply the token in your home. You father, you got to say we don't do this in this house. Bring a revival in your home. Stop watching all those dirty things. Angels are not going to appear in such a house. It is your responsibility responsibility &gt;&gt; what comes in and out of your home because you are the gatekeeper. It is your responsibility to get into those gadgets, all those things that are being washed and not washed because angels will not come in your home. It is your responsibility to make sure that people talk right in your house, speak the right language. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God also says the Holy Spirit is a meek day where there are fights and arguments. &gt;&gt; If you are constantly having fights and arguments, that's not a conducive environment for the angel of the Lord. But it's things that happen every day. If it happens, you got to make amends. So the Holy Spirit can live in your house so you can have angelic visitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are candidates of angelic visitation. It did not end in the Old Testament. It is supposed to be happening today. We are supposed to see it. You are not just supposed to wait to come to church to feel the presence of the Lord. You are supposed to feel the presence of your of the Lord in your house. Amen. When people come to your house, they should feel a heavy burden leaving them because they are coming in a place where angels stay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember some time ago We used to fight a lot with my siblings &gt;&gt; and my mom would say, "Hold on. &gt;&gt; Stop fighting. &gt;&gt; Get out of this house. Finish your argument. Then when you are done with your argument, then come back in the house because I don't want evil spirits in my house. I want a good atmosphere in this house atmosphere." So there's a lot of people who come here with burdens and you are just trying to add to it. But then when you are arguing, you are not going to stop your argument to go outside just to finish arguing and come back. The argument is just going to end right there. If you are fighting, you're not going to be like, "Hold on. Let's go outside. Let's finish this and come back in. But but then the argument is already done. But you need to keep your house for the angel of the Lord. The angel of the Lord encampeth around those that fear him. So if he is encamping around you and you scare him away, you are scaring away your protection. You are scaring him away. But you are supposed to keep him around you so that wherever you are, &gt;&gt; he is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe in angelic visitation? Amen. I'll end with this one one more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The prophet of God is talking about two ladies. who came into the prayer line &gt;&gt; and they got prayed for. &gt;&gt; It's a lengthy reading but I'll go straight through. I'll just long &gt;&gt; and um he says see I have no way. He say that when I'm speaking it's not me under inspiration. &gt;&gt; It's not me but it's him. &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire that we've seen in the picture. That pillar of fire you see here is not just a fire but it's God. That's why he said it is him. That pillar of fire that you have seen in the picture. He says that woman was told with this stomach trouble. The woman was told with the stomach trouble, thus says the Lord, you are going to be well. Go eat. Thus says the Lord does not fail. Amen. And she had come and she had in her stomach. And in the prayer line, the prophet of God tell her, "Thus says the Lord, you are going to be well. Go eat." And a woman come behind her. Had a lump on her throat, &gt;&gt; or you could call it a goiter. Amen. So the first woman had ousters in her stomach &gt;&gt; and the woman who came behind her had a goer in her a lump in her stomach and told her just the same. She was going to be healed. &gt;&gt; So this one with our was told that says the Lord you're going to be healed. Go eat. the one behind with a lump of throat in her was also told the same thing. You were going to be healed. The woman when she left the platform, she felt for her lump. It was still there. It didn't fall just right off. But she went off the platform rejoicing. She said, "If God could inspire that person to tell me what was in my life, I'll be destined to disbelieve that what he said wouldn't come to pass." That's right. So, she she felt it. She didn't see the evidence of it, &gt;&gt; but she said, "If that man see things in my life, my lamp might be still here, but I know he's going to be gone." Amen. And the woman went home. The first one at the houses, she tried to eat and every time she would eat, it would just burn her up. She couldn't do it. Weeks passed. Six weeks or more. &gt;&gt; She was still believing. &gt;&gt; She kept on she both of them kept on holding thus says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother, sister, when you hear thus says the Lord, it is going to happen. If thus says the Lord saying you are going to be set free, I don't care how long it's going to take. I know I'm going to be set free. If thus says the Lord says I'm going to get the Holy Ghost, I don't know how long it's going to take. I know it is coming. If you are barren and thus says the Lord says you are going to have a baby and one day you will hold that baby in your arms. It may take 25 years for like for Sarah or 14 years for Rachel, but it is coming. Anyways, thus says the Lord. These two women kept on believing. Six weeks passed. They kept on believing. Amen. And one morning, the one who had als went to school and she got hungry. So before her kids went to school, she used to make she used to make food for them, breakfast. Then this day they left a lot of leftovers and they went. She kept on believing. It says, "And she picked up a little piece of toast and eat it. It didn't come back cuz every time she tried to eat something, it would be." But she thought, "That's strange." A real funny feeling came over her. So, she tried the toast. The toast didn't come out. And then she's like, "Let me eat some oats. Let me eat some oats." It didn't come out. And she drank a cup of coffee. It stayed down too. Why? She had been healed because she kept on believing. Thus says the Lord will never fail. And she was told in that prayer line, she said, "Be it unto me according to whatever the prophet has said." Because when the prophet is speaking, that's God speaking through him. So she said, "Lord, you told me I'm going to be healed. So I know I'm going to be healed. I don't know when." Six weeks later, she ate all the kids leftovers and she was completely healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and it stayed and why she just felt so good. She said, "I believe I'll run down and tell my neighbor." And remember the woman who was behind her who had the goiter in a in a she was her neighbor and once she got her stomach healed, she said, "I'mma run and tell my neighbor the good news just like what Mary did. is when Mary received the good news, she ran to Elizabeth. And when she got to Elizabeth, Elizabeth also had good news and they started rejoicing. And the prophet God says, "I believe I'll run down and tell my neighbor." That's what she said. And down the street, she went with a little shaw on her down there. the little woman about in her 30s. And she ran down to tell the other woman and said, "Oh, sister." She started telling her, she started telling her testimony that my ulcers are gone. My stomach trouble is gone. The food that I just ate stayed in my stomach, she says, "I'll go tell her what happened." And when she knocked at the door, she heard somebody screaming in the house. That woman where the goita was uh was was screaming and she opened the door to see what was going on and run in. And there was a woman standing before her screaming at the top of her voice. The lamp had just left her throat. In another in another sermon, the prophet of God says when she walked in, the woman who had been healed her when she walked into the woman screaming, she was busy straightening up her sheets like this. She was looking for the goiter cuz she was in bed. She was in bed. She felt for it. it is gone. She looked around. She couldn't see it. She started opening up the beding around for the goer. That lump in her neck was gone. Hallelujah. Six weeks later, thus says the Lord had happened. Amen. And they followed me over to a meeting in Chicago and stood and testified and said, "What happened, Brother Brandham? He says, "Why?" I say, "Do you not know that sometimes when you pray?" The angels of God can get to you at that time, Daniel prayed one time to 21 days before the angel could could get to him. But when God had spoke anything, it has to come to pass. That's why you need to believe the word of God. When the word of God comes into your ears with ears of faith, you said, "Let it be unto me according to thy word." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Says, "What was it?" The angel of God knowed those people. The angel of God knowed what God had pronounced. The angels know your name. The angels know your address. They know where you live. And he says, "And he was going through that neighborhood right then, hunting them, hunting them woman up, performing what he said would come to pass. Hallelujah. Six weeks after that, says the Lord, an angel came in the neighborhood and started going door to door. Every promise that God had given, it had to come to pass. All the children of God who had believed the word of God, things start happening, they received their healing at the same time. Brother, sister, believe the word of God. He knows your address. He knows where you live. He knows where you work at. He knows where you go to school at. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just keep on believing the word of God. The angels are on their way. So when you see something good happening to your neighbor, you might as well start rejoicing. See your neighbor being healed. Start rejoicing. When you see your neighbor being blessed, start rejoicing. Don't be jealousy over your brother cuz you are going to be distracted when something happens to your neighbor. jumping for joy. What does it mean? The angel is in the neighborhood. You are the next stop. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your promise being delivered is the next stop because you are a child of God who believe the word of God who took him at his word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I can tell you this morning that angels are in the building this morning. They are delivering your heart's desire. They are answering your prayer. They know where you're seated. They know your name. They know where you live. They know exactly what you prayed for. They are not going to give you someone else's blessing. give you what is yours. No one can take what is yours. What is yours? No one can take your blessing from you. Just believe the word of God and say Lord let it be unto me according to your word. If you said I will be healed, angels are bringing that healing to your doorstep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you say, "I've been delivered." Angels are bringing deliverance to your doorstep. If you see your neighbor getting a car, start rejoicing because you are also about to be blessed with a car. Your neighbor gets blessed by God and buys a house, start rejoicing and say, "Lord, where is mine? I'm not jealous for them, &gt;&gt; but I'm waiting for what you have for me. Why? The angel is in the neighborhood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The angels are in this place this morning. It is up to you to receive your heart's desire. It will be a foolish thing for you to leave in this place. And you don't receive your heart's desire. God has a promise. Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, he said I will be there. So I can say for sure this afternoon, God is in this place. And there are angels filling up each and every aisle. Just reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by. Say, "Pass me not a gentle savior. Say, I've waited too long. I have prayed for too long. It is time for angels to bring me my blessing. I have prayed for too long. &gt;&gt; It is time for angels to bring my deliverance. &gt;&gt; You've been fighting a battle. &gt;&gt; You don't fight a battle by yourself. Remember Elijah, there were angels filled up in the in the valley. You don't fight your own battles. He fights for you. The angels are on their way. So brother, sister this afternoon, you can start rejoicing. Let us all stand and give the Lord a shout of praise. Somebody say, say, "Praise the Lord." Somebody say, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have received my house desire." Turn around to your neighbor and say, "It is my turn." Tell your other neighbor it is my turn. And also tell them again it is your turn because the angel is in the neighborhood. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us give the Lord a shout of praise. Oh glory. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; As we are all just getting into prayer, &gt;&gt; let's just sing this song and say thank you. Amen. You're not saying, "Lord, please do it for me." But you're saying, "Lord, thank you for already doing it because I have to accept it." Once I've accepted it, there's only one thing left for it to happen. And once the angels are on the doorstep, I know it's already done. So this afternoon, I want each and every one of us give God thanks. &gt;&gt; Give God thanks for what you've been praying for. If you've been seeking the Holy Ghost, say thank you, Lord, for the Holy Ghost. Whatever you've been praying for, say thank you, Lord. I have accepted it. There's only one thing left for God to be obligated &gt;&gt; to do what he said he will do in his word. Just give him thanks. Let us sing this song before we get into prayer. Thank you Lord.

I am waiting for you to do what you said you will do in your word. Say thank you Jesus for already doing it. Say Lord I'm bringing a thanksgiving praise because I know you've already done it. Oh Jesus. Thank you Lord for speaking to us this afternoon. Oh God, thank you for your word, reminding us Lord that we need to take you at your word and whatever your word says about us, we need to say amen. We need to say let it be according unto us, according to your word, oh God. Lord, I ask you this morning, oh God, look at each and every raised hand. Oh God, look at each and every petition that your children have. They know only you can grant their hearts desires. Oh God, I stand this morning interceding for your people. Oh God, saying, Lord, I hear your people's prayers. Oh God, you said if my people who are called by my name, if they humble themselves and pray, Lord, you said you would hear from heaven. Lord, I know you are obligated to hear our hearts cry. Oh God, this morning we are not crying to anyone else, but we are crying to you because we know you are the author and the finisher of our faith. Whatever our faith has started believing on, you are the one who bring it in our hands. You are the one who bring it may be made manifest in our lives. Oh God, give us enough grace to know that you have already given us that faith and to know that you are more than able. Lord, your word tells us you are more than able to do what you said you will do. So we are standing on that word that never fails saying Lord do what you said you will do. Oh God you have never failed before and you are not going to start failing today. Lord I pray that you dispatch your host of angels oh God to come to each and every one of us's home and deliver our heart's desires. If you did it before, you can do it again.

We have a testimony from sister sister Karen. God bless y'all. Um I just have a small testimony. &gt;&gt; I felt a strong feeling in me when brother Sam came up. to give a testimony. So I told my husband, &gt;&gt; tell somebody. &gt;&gt; And then when um brother Sam read this um that he had over there and the quote said, &gt;&gt; as soon as God word sink in your heart, &gt;&gt; get up and give a testimony. And I felt like God was speaking to me. &gt;&gt; Um so this testimony is just to um tell somebody that whatsoever you desire just really have faith cuz God is able. He's able. &gt;&gt; I have a few notes. So I just don't leave anything now. &gt;&gt; So I got married in last August. &gt;&gt; Yes. And doing in September, &gt;&gt; I found out that I was pregnant and then a few week passed. &gt;&gt; I was talking to one of my coworker She was also pregnant, &gt;&gt; but she was saying that she was going to have an abortion. &gt;&gt; And then um few weeks passed again. &gt;&gt; I had a miscarriage. &gt;&gt; It was one of the toughest moment of my life. I'm like, God, you know, other people, they're trying to have abortion. Why is this, you know, happening to me? &gt;&gt; Even though we didn't plan to have a baby, but it still broke my heart. Um, so time passed, months passed, my husband and I start praying for a baby. And then there was a service where brother Lee was preaching. &gt;&gt; The the anointing was very strong. &gt;&gt; Um I saw my husband, he was playing instrument here. He came there and started praying with me. &gt;&gt; And I kept believing that God is going to give me another baby. And the crazy thing is like I wasn't even pregnant yet, &gt;&gt; but people started telling my husband congratulation like is it started asking me is your wife pregnant? &gt;&gt; I was just shocked you know I was like okay. Um and then um a a week passed &gt;&gt; uh we had uh services with brother Chosi in March last year and he kept preaching and like he gave me like his preaching gave me so much faith, &gt;&gt; so much faith. And then Monday pass I took a pregnancy test. &gt;&gt; It was negative. &gt;&gt; Tuesday passed. &gt;&gt; Negative. &gt;&gt; Negative. &gt;&gt; Wednesday passed. &gt;&gt; Negative. &gt;&gt; Negative. &gt;&gt; And then Thursday came by. &gt;&gt; I took another test. &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't take a test. I went to the hospital because I was feeling kind of weird. &gt;&gt; My hCG level was high. Yeah. Where was I? &gt;&gt; And I told my sister &gt;&gt; and I was like, "Yeah, definitely God gave me a child. I conceived &gt;&gt; and then the devil started fighting me again. The same symptoms that I was feeling when I was I had the first miscarriage started coming back. But I kept saying in my heart that the battle is the Lord. And then a few weeks passed again. My apartment was almost on fire. The devil kept fighting me again &gt;&gt; and I just I just call on the name of the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; and that fire was completely gone. &gt;&gt; And then when I was 34 weeks pregnant &gt;&gt; throughout my pregnancy my blood pressure was fine. And then um when I was 34 weeks pregnant um I had a high blood pressure &gt;&gt; and the doctor told me that you have to stay here and we have to monitor you throughout the whole uh the whole week. &gt;&gt; Um I stayed the whole week in faith. Brother Brooks was praying. Sister Ruby was calling me every time to check up on me. &gt;&gt; And then u brother Chosi had to come back again. He came back in Lington, Kentucky to preach. &gt;&gt; I usually don't have um the attitude to kind of listen to different preachers, but I don't anymore. that day at the hospital just I was listening to him preach again. &gt;&gt; I had like it gave me so much faith again &gt;&gt; just to keep believing &gt;&gt; throughout that service. I saw my sister in the back. anointing got her &gt;&gt; and in my heart I just said that my sister's praying for me and then when we talked the following day she said yes I was praying for you. &gt;&gt; Um I just want to thank God that the baby came out safe. encourage anybody just have faith. &gt;&gt; I I will probably not doubt God anymore. &gt;&gt; This uh experience has gave me so much faith to keep on having faith. &gt;&gt; Despite what I go through, &gt;&gt; all I just wanted to say just have faith. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord for testimony. Going to sing a song while we dis dismiss the goodness of God. I love you, Lord. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me.
