valuable than any other day somewhere else and we're in a good place we're in the good place in the correct place [Music] we're in a place where god can do anything any time first king chapter 18 verse 22 to 29. read in the name of the lord jesus christ then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one block for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it in the wood no fire under and i will dress the other block and lay it on the wood and put no fire under pre envelope and all the people entered and said it is well spoken and elijah said unto the prophet of baal prepared even until noon saying oh they'll hear us but there was no voice nor any that entered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry loud for he is god for he he is a god either he's talking or is pursuing or is in a journey or pre-adventure he's or her adventure he slippeth with knives midday was passed that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice neither any they need to enter nor any that regarded so [Music] for amen amen i'm going to keep reading in psalm chapter 20. from the first verse to the ninth and in the name of our god we will set set up our banners the lord will fulfill all thy petition verses 6 he says jesus know i that the lord saveth is anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots [Music] we call upon the name of the and i'm lord going to continue from the message i preached last time it's a sermon that i preach in series because last time we talked about where was the god of elijah in confrontation it was when elijah was with elijah and he was in the in in front of the jordan and he had to be sure that the god of elijah was with him [Music] elizabeth and we noticed that elijah before saying we're asking where was the god of elijah he had to fulfill everything elijah told him to [Music] [Music] israel started worshiping other gods a lot of them went away got away from the principles to the point where there was confusion who had the duty of restoring the true worship in israel and it was a challenge in front of the people to the people which god was a true god because the people of israel started worshiping a dead deity and elijah called the people of israel in mount carmel it was a battle between him and and the and the prophets of baal bible bible shows it says we read okay elijah was standing in front of four hundred prophets the number they got did not deny his faith because of the four hundred four hundred problems neither their way of dressing is unfair he didn't care about all the uh everything they were doing very importantly no matter how much they they cut their their skin that their blood was coming out they didn't bother elijah said was never panicked and proud of those circumstances [Applause] they're they're called worship remember even they're they're they're caught their bodies those things did not make elijah afraid who only had david yes yes god does not need that that's what happened we met that sir yes brothers and sisters i just want you to know this thing because jesus he never tells them to vote if they have to remember they're just there to execute [Music] for us his children amen amen we manifest and the only thing that god cares about it's his own work god doesn't need everything anything else whether there are a thousand philistines [Music] whether there are 600 philosophers the only thing that god cares about now this uh does god change his word in paragraph 69 the people of israel were going in in palestine is [Music] the job was never too big the giants of the day nothing to israel though they were small men in stature in the mountains but they were walking and god says the lord don't care so no matter what the opposition that says it's not his word of promise never failed israel we may face that sir yes my brother is now don't judge them the only thing that god cares about yourself was that his word therefore never fail that the only thing that god cared about was that his word will never fail amen that was that's what it was brother brothers they were walking with thou saith the lord now my brothers and sisters taught us he said israel israel in the bible you are the type of the church today is i believe that our condition should be better than the people of israel remember amen amen [Music] you start preparing your sunday in your house you don't come in church here to prepare your sunday preparation you prepare your sunday in your home let's have this someday in the evening of saturday now listen that's a redeemed son of god a redeemed son of god today [Applause] a redeemed son of god today is the light amen redeemed son of god today it's god himself nothing can stand god [Music] you're on your way to the commandment you're filling all the commands of god nothing can stand against you just like israel a redeemed son of god son of god when they're putting their negative frequency they [Music] that means that you're walking with the world you're walking worth [Applause] he was not impressed by their worship that's the battle that was between elijah and the prophets of the bear brother says in the book of exodus first part yes don't be ashamed when we don't be scandalized when we say brother proud i'm saying moses was i already left the scene but in the synagogue where they were always reading moses moses said moses said and moses said us in this time in this place we believe that god has sent us a man like for israel [Music] and in wanted to the people of israel wanted to take the place of moses they said well is it just you that the lord god can speak to you as you just said and god was angry and he said he is moses gather the people at the feet and moses gathered the people after the fast directly despite their their devotion despite their consecration even though they can't secrete it themselves it is under normal ease they say numbers we can't stand this no what about you no you talk to god and then come [Applause] all those other prophets that you see everywhere shake their hands like this it's not those prophets that i'm talking about i'm talking about the prophets in the trump it says evening after evening there is never have been one fear in my heart not one time why have i never been afraid brother branham says oscar because god says you're no longer made of materials that can't flee away when the power of jesus christ anointed perfect you're no longer made of materials that can make you run voila because jesus christ anointed [Applause] you you're already taken by the devil amen amen brother brennan says fear is a great curse you cannot explain it brother brother says to the soul that god gave you amen amen if the devil can make you ah if the devil can make you doubt of the weapon that god gave you that means he's already had he he had he has a man amen and brother says that's it february brother branham says jesus jesus not necessarily our god why did he did he always have victory all the time he did not express his quality of god's success but brother brethren says jesus was always always had victories don't we have a lot of promises that have been made about us that in that day daniel prophesied he said don't we have a lot of promises it is the girl that says that i'm why are we acting like orphans [Applause] you're no longer made of materials that can make you wrong we may press that yes my brother [Music] that means it's [Music] he will explode in your life in your life by a bad bad circumstance but it's not going to kill you it's nothing but a they're worth no fighters giving you the power of the thunder of jesus christ and to call those things as if they did not exist we manifest that son yes my brothers and sisters brother branham says and if this demon has come to you this morning tried [Music] the if he does not want to believe it if the devil doesn't believe obey to that sentence the holy spirit is here the law of god will cast him out i will vindicate the things the angels of god will take positions and the demons will run away and you can stand there and say we miss your celebrity yes sir it's the truth if you have been uh [Music] and the devil wants to prematurely take you to the tomb and then we have been here [Music] stands [Applause] but you who wants to prematurely take you to the tombs of the church but the angel of god will stand between you and sickness [Applause] that's what the promise was thank you lord probably my brothers and sisters the bible says like the angel of the lord go to the circular canyon it stands out and takes him away from danger eternal the angel of the lord god did god not say it the lord will send his angels they will keep you on your way to your power country so that you don't hear the stone on the road amen we have a multitude of promises as the prophets he promised to the true god higher than an angel's prayer dancer a prayer ever since i am in the other four will go a million times higher than the prayer of an angel his brother brother says it here the rest of your life amen amen yes my brothers and sisters the prayer of the saints a million times more than an angel you're going to tell me why why what's that brother because an angel is a servant no no some of the feasts are defeated we're sons of god you'll have more value in your in your eyes [Music] that's right my brother and sister [Music] yes no matter the condition you find yourself in a fine problem it's not a problem for god whether you are the weakest of christians god can answer your prayer amen when you bow [Music] never be in a suffering a suffering like jo where that jonas was amen because jonas jonas tied himself he tied himself he bound himself on a very yellow man they tied his hands and more than that again in it says that even if i see all those things there are lies of the devil [Applause] jonas did not accept that i did he says [Music] program and accept the provided way that god provided for me yes my brother and sister god can take the impossible and make it possible not just make i want you to take a journey with me the world of possible [Music] god can make [Music] there is no wall called jericho that can stand come on brother horses don't help god no let's say your body no don't try to help god when a person in the bible tried to help god it was saying notice [Music] a lot of oxygen the battle was [Music] use there is no called right to god there is no well yeah that's called to swallow somebody to god there is no lie that's a prisoner because we've been anointed by the power of jesus christ and we can't right to the state regardless and i looked at this child and he asked me brother bran [Music] can you tell me something that can comfort me i told him yes because he was not healed you're putting shame on this thing and the young men sitting there saying if you were sitting where i am if you are in the [Music] and if you what and the boys that's why he received this healing brother what i'm saying it says where the message will be praised this morning it's not when god is taken by his word [Applause] and his don't you accept the words of the devil if look at you you have to believe god is put in authority no you want this as the blood of jesus that's covering you it's enough to fulfill anything amen even if you have the holy ghost that's why [Music] with the knowledge of the world because i already know that [Music] until death will set you free you have to tell us to tell you the the blood of bullocks no matter the suffering difficulties of the difficulty he was always saying i know that the lord will save his anointing upon the name of the lord the name of the lord is a strong tower [Applause] foreign if you don't do this i'm gonna kill you no he's a god who uses his mercy toward his life the god god is near everyone because he said call me and i will answer you now david [Music] [Applause] and i've never seen his seed uh bag has bread and now listen how we're going to understand this problem because everything that happened in the bible was a time this is a type of this day and god could talk to him face to face he was the righteous man of god now if god is in his soul if he doesn't want to consider us as righteous man at least there was a righteous man today and we are the seeds and we have a banana abraham [Applause] amen [Music] and vocabulary call upon him call upon him and i will answer it god will answer from us if he's the god of answers [Applause] that's the name of [Applause] nothing is impossible to you let's stand [Applause] is leaders in the song [Music] in moments like
