[0:00] bread the bread wheat die you live by
[0:04] their substance therefore if it takes
[0:07] dead substance to make us live
[0:09] physically how much more did it take
[0:11] depth so we could live spiritually
[0:13] forever something had to die so
[0:17] therefore we could think that those who
[0:19] think that water baptism say that's
[0:22] that's out those who think that good
[0:25] works saves or law that's out it takes
[0:28] death that you might live Christ died
[0:31] and the Bible said to you to know him is
[0:33] life not to know him but to know him the
[0:37] person is life the other died every one
[0:42] of us if you see yourself living Lord
[0:44] kill me know what this must die Oh even
[0:53] the heathens know that that if something
[0:55] must die Dahlia that's why they have
[1:02] human sacrifices in places they knew
[1:05] human whatever you know which is even
[1:07] know that their kill something just to
[1:11] bring a curse a curse to life but why
[1:18] would Christians see i'ma tell you I
[1:19] know y'all want to tell you some folks I
[1:22] know one thing the tree of knowledge and
[1:26] good and evil will be done away with
[1:28] there's only one tree at the end and
[1:31] that's the Tree of Life two trees in the
[1:34] garden the garden the tree of dollars of
[1:38] good and evil and the tree of life at
[1:40] the end in the book of Revelation
[1:42] there's only one tree that lives and
[1:44] that's the Tree of Life so you can't get
[1:47] to heaven amen with having the tree of
[1:49] knowledge and good and evil
[1:50] yah yo the seed cannot be mixed it has
[1:54] to be a pure seed and that seed is what
[1:56] God put in you that's why it must die
[2:01] brother Brown said even the foolish
[2:03] virgin had potential but they never
[2:06] brought the seed to life same material
[2:14] the great of all gives his life you
[2:18] understand me I want to live I don't
[2:21] want to die
[2:22] I know that this old Tabernacle was
[2:25] shared but after this shared I don't
[2:27] want to go down I want to go up I want
[2:30] to live among the living
[2:31] you understand me and I know that the
[2:34] only way I can do that is that I must
[2:36] die you see that I'm saying that you
[2:38] know what y'all might this I'm seeing
[2:42] something that I don't know how to bring
[2:44] it but I'm trying my best to bring it
[2:46] because I do know one thing that there
[2:49] are places in my life that needs to die
[2:51] and right I wanted to die in rot take me
[2:57] there Lord Jesus take me there
[3:00] what good is to have all of this and
[3:03] miss heaven well good to know that you
[3:07] existed and you had a time or place in
[3:10] life where you could have had inherited
[3:12] eternal life and be like uh some some
[3:17] some messenger right Jared's messenger
[3:24] we need the messenger to tell Jesus
[3:26] you know to mean what good is that
[3:28] looking God right in the face what good
[3:31] is it to look this message right in the
[3:33] face and not be willing to do what it's
[3:35] asking you to do when I thought better
[3:41] than life what could be better than life
[3:43] so life has two meanings one of it one
[3:47] of its people call life today it's not
[3:50] life but its death many people think
[3:54] that sin drinking gambling writ reveling
[3:56] they call that life either that's the
[3:58] truth you know I've had mothers and
[4:00] fathers who literally stopped their
[4:02] children from coming to church because
[4:04] they say if you come and you get into
[4:06] that message you're gonna miss out on
[4:08] life oh you're missing out on death I
[4:13] can't help but to think of the torment
[4:16] that those parents are gonna have if
[4:18] when they realize their influence it may
[4:21] cause their sons and daughters amen to
[4:24] miss life cuz everybody gonna die
[4:27] one way or the other you go down here to
[4:31] one of the honky Thompson tonight and
[4:33] you can see them dancing and the young
[4:35] ladies and young men of this beautiful
[4:37] city you can hear them screaming and
[4:39] dancing and drinking and they say oh we
[4:42] are living you're mistaken you're dying
[4:45] is that right and you know that's true
[4:49] you know you see these women Amen and
[4:51] insta truth but in my day in my town in
[4:54] my city only prostitutes wore makeup
[4:58] only prostitutes died they're different
[5:01] colors it's the truth the clothes that
[5:06] they're wearing me now that's what
[5:08] signified that's what that's why you
[5:10] knew what a prostitute well by the way
[5:13] she dressed cuz she will always have
[5:14] dress they have dress no more brother
[5:17] Mike then they kid and people don't even
[5:21] realize Amen that if that Holy Ghost is
[5:24] not in your soul I didn't say your
[5:26] spirit because there's a lot of
[5:28] Pentecostal people who have the Holy
[5:30] Ghost on their spirit they can preach
[5:32] they are nurtured they can prophesy they
[5:34] can have visions and dreams and all of
[5:36] these things but they have never been
[5:39] born in the soul and the Bible said that
[5:42] soul that sinneth not your spirit the
[5:46] soul that sinneth shall surely die and
[5:49] this message is the only message that
[5:53] takes you behind the veil most people
[5:56] don't even know what you're talking
[5:56] about when you say behind the veil you
[5:59] know this message thank God for it when
[6:03] it looks like you know we we you know
[6:05] we've fewer all the time and number the
[6:07] numbers and decreasing look among us
[6:09] people who could come to church don't
[6:11] come ah it's on the spirit if it was in
[6:15] the soul they'll be driven hallelujah it
[6:18] was in the soul I mean you can't happen
[6:20] to come something drives you to church
[6:22] even when you're tired and don't feel
[6:25] like it something makes you come Wow
[6:27] that's that soul and that soul needs to
[6:30] be fed and that soul knows that he grows
[6:33] by hearing the word brother been said
[6:36] the Holy Ghost has a feed on the word
[6:43] that kind of life couldn't be what David
[6:46] was talking about uh
[6:47] because that life gets to Mirabal till
[6:50] min takes a pistol and puts it at their
[6:54] head and blow their brains out with that
[6:56] kind of life men climb to the highest
[6:58] story in their hotel rooms up there with
[7:01] living with men and drinking and holding
[7:05] their hands and jump to their death with
[7:08] what kind of life to lead right so David
[7:11] could not Ben have meant a meaning our
[7:13] meaning that kind of life so it's got a
[7:16] perverted you see it's a perverted life
[7:19] then if that kind of life isn't right
[7:21] then what is the right kind of life thy
[7:25] loving-kindness is better than better to
[7:28] me than life just to know that God's
[7:31] loving-kindness y'all understand me it
[7:33] means more to me if I gotta be that's
[7:35] who I want to talk with I want to talk
[7:37] with Lazarus when I get there that one
[7:40] that was at the rich man table I need to
[7:42] talk to him see everybody else want to
[7:45] talk to everybody else I want to talk to
[7:47] that one why because the Bible says
[7:50] never I seen the righteous forsaken nor
[7:53] seed begging bread and we find that this
[7:56] Lazarus who was literally a servant of
[8:00] the Lord was there trying to get the
[8:02] crumbs from the rich man table but no
[8:05] Devils the devil said you can't be here
[8:07] because he's written hallelujah
[8:12] but that never knew he has far who is
[8:15] far the world every because he and he
[8:17] held on the faith even though
[8:19] circumstances look really grim for him
[8:21] he may have become a laughingstock how
[8:24] can you say you're a Christian you see
[8:26] God does what he wants to do Lazarus was
[8:30] put there for the rich man it was the
[8:32] rich man test not Lazarus a man that
[8:36] rich man had a second chance and he
[8:38] steals all hallelujah amen he lost one
[8:42] chance when he wouldn't follow Jesus and
[8:44] he lost a second chance when he wouldn't
[8:46] feed Lazarus but Jesus said even if you
[8:50] give a righteous man
[8:53] in the name of huh you'd get a righteous
[8:57] reward so all he had to do was feed
[8:59] Lazarus and we would have made it to
[9:02] heaven but because he missed the second
[9:04] chance he found that in his third time
[9:07] there was no way of escape a preacher in
[9:11] hell that's what he was brother and said
[9:14] God called him to preach and he'd rather
[9:17] have his riches ooh a lot of preachers
[9:22] hallelujah
[9:24] is this okay just give me a few more
[9:27] minutes please
[9:38] well surely God is good to us huh you
[9:42] know in this life sometimes
[9:44] circumstances are hard right now I think
[9:45] all of us are going through some
[9:46] hardships so hard times and you know you
[9:49] wonder why you know I mean it's like we
[9:53] don't understand a lot of things
[9:54] I just know and God doesn't have to give
[9:57] us an answer for it if you choose to
[10:00] give us an answer the reason that it's
[10:02] okay but at the end of the day we will
[10:04] better understand that by-and-by because
[10:07] I do sometimes I wonder what this is all
[10:08] about and why you know did I cause this
[10:11] or whatever the case may be but you know
[10:13] I heard a message today brother Brent
[10:14] says you know a lot of things that we
[10:16] suffer it's because of generational
[10:18] things that has been passed down to you
[10:21] and God allows it hello he allows it I
[10:26] mean if he gives if he gives you the
[10:28] faith to overcome it you will overcome
[10:30] it but if he doesn't give you the faith
[10:33] is his will you said what do you mean
[10:35] because faith come by God God has a
[10:38] purpose for every one of our lives right
[10:41] remember ladies brother element down at
[10:43] berm Tabernacle who was in a wheelchair
[10:44] almost all a lot she died that way she
[10:47] had faith but it just wasn't the will of
[10:49] God for her to get up and guess what God
[10:52] used her as a testimony because she
[10:54] constantly praise God and gave him
[10:56] thanks and glory regardless to her
[10:57] situation right
[11:00] you think love the Lord now let me say
[11:02] like this and I'm a hurry up because I
[11:04] don't wanna be too much longer
[11:05] but what you think about brother Branham
[11:07] when he were talking about this slave
[11:09] who came over here on the ship you know
[11:12] a lot of slaves you know they were
[11:13] jumped ship because they didn't want to
[11:15] be enslaved they will actually commit
[11:17] suicide before they got here
[11:19] because they knew it in some hearts and
[11:22] minds it was better to be dead than to
[11:24] be enslaved so anyway the ones who made
[11:27] it over you don't remember the story
[11:29] about the the king's son I thought about
[11:31] that I thought about that cuz I got some
[11:33] sons a falling in my image I mean they
[11:36] were one day but they not following me
[11:38] now
[11:38] you understand me they're not they're
[11:40] not for all brother dad is a preaching
[11:42] he's trying to live right before God I'm
[11:43] gonna think i'ma go no but here was a
[11:46] king son but it was a blood in that man
[11:48] that made him where he was
[11:51] hallelujah honestly it was a blood this
[11:56] cuz y'all know that that's true
[11:58] sometimes preachers if you've become
[12:00] they have preachers after preachers at
[12:03] the preacher in families one after
[12:05] another after another another because
[12:06] that gene that gene keeps popping up for
[12:10] the purpose of God but then you know you
[12:12] think about a king son you know you got
[12:15] those who who follow remember go through
[12:18] the Bible and see how many king's sons
[12:20] really followed their daddy and did a
[12:23] good job
[12:24] not too many most of all most Devils
[12:27] right it's true I mean and you think
[12:30] about it that that God had to take
[12:32] Solomon you know brother brother Troy
[12:35] preached only the other day about the
[12:37] sons and everything you know Absalon and
[12:40] all of them want to be king right but
[12:43] you know it wasn't for them it was for
[12:45] Solomon right so you look at it you saw
[12:49] what do you mean brother Brooks this boy
[12:51] was a king's son and it doesn't say
[12:54] whether this that the King had any other
[12:56] songs but one thing about this son he
[12:59] was to be king and he knew it he knew he
[13:03] had keep royal blood right so he acted
[13:08] the life that was in his daddy was now
[13:11] in him y'all hear him saying when the
[13:13] life of God comes in you you become a
[13:16] king and so wherever you are you conduct
[13:19] yourself as a king what are you in your
[13:22] kingdom a lot you are a king does
[13:25] anybody recognize you or not you are
[13:27] king David was a king and many people
[13:30] did not recognize him as a king but he
[13:32] still was a king hmm and so what happens
[13:37] you see when you really got the Holy
[13:39] Ghost God don't have to whip you into
[13:40] shape god don't have to make you do
[13:43] nothing the king's blood is in you not
[13:48] my weird lord but thine be done the king
[13:52] blood is in you you can't help but act
[13:55] like him or talk like him and walk like
[13:57] him and do the things that a king
[13:59] doesn't what he did it would do right
[14:02] they said let me buy this man no do you
[14:04] feel
[14:05] better know he has number and his
[14:07] conditions were no better than anyone
[14:10] else
[14:10] and sometimes we feel like well because
[14:12] I'm a Christian maybe my condition
[14:14] supposed to be better all the time
[14:15] they're not why because that's not where
[14:18] virtue is is it's created and built fine
[14:21] living you know to me and you might have
[14:23] fine living but don't think you're gonna
[14:25] be exempt from trials tests gonna come
[14:27] you understand me there'll be times you
[14:30] you you might me have money but you
[14:33] might not have joy which one is more
[14:35] important that's all I'm saying
[14:39] and when it comes to life you and I must
[14:41] understand by God's grace because you
[14:44] are to be built and because you are
[14:46] creature of God being created you must
[14:49] go through the fire hallelujah and
[14:53] understand this fire is not to destroy
[14:55] you this fire is to build you it is
[14:58] making you it is coming to a place and I
[15:01] don't care I always tell God and in my
[15:04] prayer whatever it takes that so that
[15:07] you could be reflected in me so do it
[15:10] lord I give you my will that your will
[15:15] be done this is okay I'm gonna give you
[15:20] one more example cuz 8:38 here so did
[15:26] you understand that God III just can't
[15:29] help but to think the Queen of Sheba and
[15:31] I said this the other day I think about
[15:33] her how she three months journey three
[15:37] months in a desert you know you had the
[15:40] Ishmaelites and all of them their
[15:41] Arabian Nights murderers and thieves and
[15:47] everything else and she just heard of
[15:48] the revival and she packed up everything
[15:52] she left everything her country her
[15:55] people everything I'm going to see
[15:57] because I have worshipped all of these
[15:59] idols I have been to this church and
[16:02] dead organization and disorganization
[16:04] and I haven't seen a move of God yet so
[16:07] but now I hear that there's a move of
[16:09] God over there in Israel and I'm going
[16:11] and he says she she you know brother
[16:14] said she actually packed gold and silver
[16:16] and everything she had and said if I
[16:18] over there and it would be true I'm
[16:20] gonna I'm gonna fund it with everything
[16:23] I got but that contrary to a lot of
[16:29] people in the message because what
[16:32] happens when they come to the message
[16:33] they want the message to make them rich
[16:39] instead of giving they want to receive
[16:43] y'all don't may not know what I'm
[16:44] talking about I know what I'm talking
[16:45] about see I want you to understand when
[16:48] God's real fit with real faith strikes
[16:50] you and you really see who you are no
[16:53] matter what the storm and tests yeah
[16:54] they're gonna be moments you know I
[16:57] don't believe that David was really
[16:59] thrilled and happy you know when he was
[17:02] facing death many times on when he was
[17:04] in a horrible pit and all of the us I
[17:07] love David
[17:08] you know it's just because he knew how
[17:09] to express himself he talked and he said
[17:12] what was from the heart he didn't hide
[17:14] nothing you know once he learned that
[17:16] less and everything was open and free so
[17:19] you understand by God's grace amen he's
[17:22] the kind of man I like you know I mean
[17:24] and but but you got to understand that
[17:27] in all of this you and I must know that
[17:32] God will never let you go and God will
[17:39] never let you live substandard you gonna
[17:43] come up whether you like it or not right
[17:47] it's like I tell my grandkids you know
[17:51] I've got one that don't like to put his
[17:53] clothes on he want you to put them on
[17:55] and he's too old for that I told him
[17:58] yesterday I said if we have any more
[17:59] trouble out of you I won't thank you I
[18:02] used a word whoop
[18:05] needless to say he was fully dressed
[18:07] this morning when I got up I don't know
[18:11] whether his mama helped him she might
[18:13] help cheat but she knew I meant what I
[18:15] said because sometimes it man this flesh
[18:21] you got to beat this thing sometimes
[18:23] this is a Moo did y'all know that it has
[18:25] the nature of a mule it don't want to
[18:31] get up with me
[18:31] get up yeah everything it don't and pray
[18:35] when you want to pray it don't work you
[18:37] don't want to praise God when you know
[18:39] you out - this is um you you can let
[18:42] that new hole you down if you want to
[18:44] you better bottle that thing but anyway
[18:48] let me say it like this the faith that
[18:50] we have is not an intellectual faith it
[18:52] must be a divine revelation of Jesus
[18:54] Christ to you that takes sin out of the
[18:58] heart see saying can't come out until
[19:00] the revelation of Jesus Christ comes in
[19:03] into a lake let your faith is not enough
[19:06] that's alright but it's only brings you
[19:08] to the Holy Ghost see but it let me say
[19:12] I'm sorry the Holy Ghost is a personal
[19:15] experience of the birth the new birth
[19:17] regeneration making a new creature in
[19:19] Christ name I stop there because I want
[19:24] you to understand that our lives and
[19:26] I'll be here Sunday so I'll pick up
[19:28] where I left off here
[19:30] I won't you understand that our lives
[19:31] must must be formed it must be
[19:34] transformed you must you and I we must
[19:36] be transformed we cannot continue to
[19:38] have the high the mind that we have now
[19:41] and expect to go to heaven huh this mind
[19:45] this mind the spiritual mind of our must
[19:48] be transformed
[19:49] it must be renewed renewed why renewed
[19:53] mind right it must be washed by the
[19:56] water of the word let this mind be in
[19:59] you see he ain't gonna make you have it
[20:02] he ain't gonna make you do it
[20:03] you got to let it let it you must yield
[20:06] to this you must feel I'm a seal that's
[20:11] the only way it's gonna happen
[20:12] guard I'm gonna force it but it's your
[20:15] will like he did with Jesus Jesus knew
[20:17] he was to be the sacrifice but God still
[20:20] gave him a wheel he never took his will
[20:23] away he had to give it away and in order
[20:26] for you to be successful at God that
[20:28] lived the life that we livin now we must
[20:32] give our will to God lest an
[20:48] brother well said the outward expression
[20:50] shows exactly what's in the inside
[20:52] beautiful you can't judge me I got him
