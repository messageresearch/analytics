[7:00] ah I hope you are amen I
[7:04] am praise God it's like a piece of cake
[7:07] you don't want your slice give it to
[7:11] me I take
[7:14] it brother Keith say no
[7:16] way amen when it's really
[7:20] good it's really hard to
[7:23] share I thank God for his grace and his
[7:27] Mercy if the blood was to lose his power
[7:30] where would we
[7:31] be
[7:33] God oh my mind can't even fathom it
[7:37] because you know I rely on it every day
[7:40] every moment of the day 24/7
[7:44] amen surely we thank God for the blood
[7:47] of Jesus that will never lose his
[7:49] power I uh was thinking you know because
[7:52] I know that there are those who don't
[7:54] believe in taking
[7:55] communion and you know and I wonder
[7:58] sometimes Lord
[8:00] they better be
[8:03] right if they're not
[8:05] right they've lost it because Jesus says
[8:09] if you don't take that you can have no
[8:12] part of me and you know what if you're
[8:15] going to do away with the uh communion
[8:18] you might as well stop
[8:21] baptizing
[8:23] hello you know and uh with
[8:26] water right because uh you know water
[8:30] doesn't bring you to
[8:33] Regeneration but God ordered it that we
[8:36] must do it I mean you take for example
[8:39] the tree of
[8:41] life you know a knowledge of Good and
[8:44] Evil they could have lived
[8:46] forever they had a choice and they chose
[8:50] the tree of life and look where we are
[8:54] now see it's so simple you think about
[8:58] it and and Jesus talk about it and you
[9:01] think to yourself oh Lord one thing for
[9:04] certain if you don't have to take
[9:06] communion and you're taking communion
[9:07] you still ain't
[9:10] wrong you see what I'm but the point is
[9:14] if you're supposed to take it and you're
[9:16] not taking it then you're in trouble if
[9:18] you're taking it and you don't have to
[9:21] that means you got some
[9:22] extra if you're not taking it and you're
[9:25] supposed to that means you're
[9:27] zero oh God help our souls uh you know I
[9:32] I don't know I just know one thing and I
[9:35] know one thing only the word that I have
[9:39] in me says Amen to the word amen God
[9:43] ain't going to write something about
[9:46] what we supposed to do and not amen it
[9:49] that's right hey I feel like shouting
[9:55] already Luke
[9:58] 12:32 you love the Lord oh help me help
[10:02] me please Lord get me through this by
[10:04] the grace of God you know I want to say
[10:06] by the uh the Lord uh you know when it's
[10:10] hard to ET eat Eternal bread in
[10:18] time you know you
[10:20] know because it's last forever it's it's
[10:23] just it's hard to
[10:25] eat
[10:27] hey it's true when they thought they
[10:29] were running out of here it comes
[10:32] again oh they had they ate till they
[10:35] couldn't eat no more and then they still
[10:36] had baskets over surely God is so good
[10:39] to
[10:41] us St Luke
[10:43] 12 I don't you know what my I feel so
[10:46] good when I'm in church and around God's
[10:49] people I I really do I get I get
[10:52] especially when the atmosphere is right
[10:55] I I get beside myself I feel really like
[10:57] a little kid I really do so sometime you
[11:00] see me cut up and I don't mean to but I
[11:02] can't just see I can't help it amen St
[11:06] Luke 12 and
[11:11] 32 fear not little
[11:14] flock but it is your father's good
[11:18] pleasure to give
[11:21] you the
[11:25] kingdom and we're going to tie that in
[11:28] today
[11:30] I was reading a quote and brother
[11:32] brandham say that this was the day or
[11:35] the hour of the little
[11:37] flock and when I read that it just
[11:40] really encouraged my
[11:42] soul and we're going to uh come through
[11:46] some other scriptures but let's just
[11:48] start with that by the grace of God Amen
[11:51] Heavenly Father God we come before you
[11:53] Lord is humbl we know how we thank you
[11:55] for your grace we thank you for your
[11:57] mercy we thank you for your love
[12:00] Lord you've been so good to us you've
[12:02] been better to us than we've been to
[12:04] ourselves we pray father that you would
[12:06] bless us what you have we just pray that
[12:09] you would give us Grace to receive your
[12:11] blessing we ask these things in Jesus
[12:13] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[12:18] seated in the message proving his word
[12:20] which was in
[12:22] 1964 brother bam says God was in Christ
[12:26] reconciling the world to himself he was
[12:29] the beginning of the creation his body
[12:32] was re was the redeemed creation and now
[12:35] Through the Ages the church lost its
[12:38] first love and I started that quote and
[12:40] didn't finish it and now in the last
[12:43] days you promise to call a little
[12:48] minority the little flock at the last
[12:53] days father our hearts are jumping
[12:59] and my heart's
[13:02] pounding when I think of that and know
[13:05] that your words are true and none of
[13:09] them can
[13:10] fail let these people
[13:14] today understand
[13:16] that and let the sinner seek you at this
[13:20] hour before the gates close and there be
[13:26] no more time
[13:29] let the Bride As she starts getting out
[13:32] of Step from this and that may she come
[13:36] back into the step as the vision showed
[13:39] a few weeks
[13:41] ago I pray thee father to bless now and
[13:45] heal the
[13:47] sick here are clothes laying here and
[13:50] handkerchiefs coming from different
[13:52] parts and now in the scripture says it
[13:55] was taken clothes and aprons
[13:57] handkerchiefs from the body of Paul and
[13:59] they went to the sick and God healed
[14:01] them now we know that we're not St Paul
[14:04] but we know that it wasn't St Paul it
[14:08] was the people's faith in him being your
[14:12] servant Lord these people wouldn't D
[14:15] driven these hundreds of miles if they
[14:17] didn't believe so he said it wasn't St
[14:20] Paul but it was uh the faith that the
[14:23] people had in
[14:25] him it's true I mean it's like any
[14:28] pastor it can't help you if you don't
[14:30] have faith and trust in it right it's
[14:32] it's just of no
[14:33] value amen and that's why so many people
[14:36] are not healing delivered because they
[14:37] don't have that
[14:39] Faith now we look at this thing and we
[14:42] want you to understand by the grace of
[14:45] God that you and I have been in a we in
[14:48] a h a strange
[14:51] situation and and let me let me we we
[14:53] we're considered the bride okay we're
[14:55] considered as the female
[14:58] part Now
[15:00] understand because of what Eve did she
[15:03] had no life in
[15:05] her right brother Bram says she became
[15:09] the tree of death and the Man became the
[15:12] tree of
[15:13] life because the woman has no life there
[15:17] is nothing in her to produce a
[15:20] seed except the man plants the life so
[15:24] is the bride amen we we have nothing in
[15:27] us to produce Christ except Christ
[15:30] plants the
[15:31] seed and before he does we're just
[15:36] dead we can just be a incubator that's
[15:40] all we
[15:40] are you know you can say well you know
[15:43] uh uh uh uh and you know the pr of God
[15:46] puts goes on to say and to think you
[15:50] think he said listen he said the only
[15:52] thing that's connected to the mother is
[15:55] the naval cord right
[16:00] because this the literal light comes
[16:03] from the father right you can say oh
[16:06] they got so many chromosomes and so but
[16:08] it takes his blood that's right Amen to
[16:12] make it come to
[16:13] life hello amen and so is it with the
[16:17] bride of Jesus it takes his blood amen
[16:21] he said listen let me and I'm reading
[16:23] from question and answers he said for
[16:26] the woman doesn't bear Life in Her M he
[16:30] said it took a woman to bring death the
[16:33] birth of a woman or from a woman brings
[16:36] death the birth from a
[16:40] man brings
[16:42] life oh come on somebody listen he said
[16:46] through our birth through the birth of a
[16:50] woman we we we we we all die cuz we've
[16:56] subject to death is that right right and
[16:59] he said through the birth of a woman
[17:02] through the birth uh uh uh brings death
[17:06] it's we're subject to death amen but he
[17:09] says through the birth of a
[17:12] man we
[17:14] have or we we forever we have life
[17:18] forever see so the woman is the tree of
[17:24] death hello now you might not like that
[17:27] it it's true anyhow now I'm bringing
[17:29] this by the grace of God so that you can
[17:32] understand you don't have no power ain't
[17:35] nothing in you if God don't put life in
[17:38] you you got
[17:40] nothing you're just
[17:43] dead and that's why all the churches
[17:46] died because they put the tree of life
[17:48] out in Leia he knocking at the door
[17:51] trying to bring life and they put him
[17:54] out so all they got is a
[17:57] shell they is
[18:00] dead dead and here we are little flock
[18:04] amen only because God prophesied Amen
[18:09] you that's right you are the thoughts of
[18:12] God manifestors for this day oh now I
[18:15] don't know about you I don't care if you
[18:17] just fult before you came in here if God
[18:19] is telling you something that's contrary
[18:22] to your thoughts take his thoughts over
[18:24] yours
[18:30] oh who can be who who who in Us in here
[18:33] can say I am I'm I'm this I'm that I'm
[18:36] this I you can't say nothing without the
[18:39] I am in
[18:41] you huh he said I am U Mali 3:6 I love
[18:45] this I am a God that changed now I can
[18:48] rest on that these glasses got in my way
[18:51] this I can rest on that I don't need but
[18:54] two witnesses
[18:55] now huh amen listen he says I am amen uh
[19:01] uh the the Lord and I change not in
[19:04] Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ says uh uh
[19:07] the word of God says Jesus Christ the
[19:08] same yesterday today and forever in
[19:10] other words he doesn't
[19:12] change what he decided to do in the
[19:15] beginning has to be the results of the
[19:20] endall there's no changing his mind amen
[19:24] you ought some somebody somebody ought
[19:26] to be shouting right now why because you
[19:29] realize God can't change his mind about
[19:32] you at all if he did it would make him
[19:37] imperfect amen he doesn't have a second
[19:40] choice that's
[19:44] right I love this because he says listen
[19:48] he talks about I am the bread of life he
[19:51] tells the people if you eat of me you
[19:53] shall not die if you drink of me you
[19:55] shall not die hello amen my because
[19:59] wherever life is I don't care God said
[20:02] in his word if you don't cry out I can
[20:05] make the rocks cry out that's what kind
[20:07] of life he is he can step into a rock
[20:10] and make a rock
[20:14] talk that's God he is life and wherever
[20:19] he is come on somebody the bush didn't
[20:22] have lips but the bush talks
[20:29] cuz he is life you mean to tell me that
[20:33] God has a harder time stepping inside of
[20:35] you no God there is no hard times for
[20:40] God God commands and it moves he speaks
[20:44] and it does what he says it doesn't come
[20:46] back void God doesn't say oops I made a
[20:49] mistake it is he is and when he say
[20:53] something it is just as though he's
[20:55] declared it because it has to come to
[20:58] pass
[21:01] we often sometime Wonder Lord how long
[21:04] it's going to take for us to reach that
[21:06] Perfection as long as God has already
[21:08] determined in his mind for
[21:12] you hello it's not him that willth nor
[21:15] he that runneth come on somebody it's
[21:17] God's timing it's God who he says I wait
[21:21] now what you going to do with this he
[21:23] says I wait for the precious
[21:27] fruit and God don't get him patience he
[21:30] know when per fruits are perfected he
[21:32] says I'm waiting on this this is what
[21:35] I've been waiting on for thousands of
[21:38] years I've waited for you to be
[21:41] perfected and know so he's he does he's
[21:44] not going to get impatient at the last
[21:47] moment see this age doesn't has it has
[21:50] no bearing on God he's not affected by
[21:56] this oh I love this
[21:59] because in the midst of all this demonic
[22:01] power and demonic Force God is being
[22:08] defiant he's proving that nothing Satan
[22:12] can produce can hinder his own his
[22:16] moveen is that right he proved that when
[22:19] he went down to Hell hell was the
[22:22] darkest and the most wicked place there
[22:24] was Hol come on somebody but he whooped
[22:27] the devil he he whooped Darkness he
[22:30] whooped everything that was down
[22:33] there so what if hell blending into
[22:36] Earth is already conquered amen
[22:39] conquered by whom Christ himself the
[22:42] very life of God now I'm telling you
[22:45] something because I'm going to get to a
[22:46] real important scripture here in just a
[22:49] moment now remember I read to you the
[22:51] last time he said he if you hunger for
[22:55] God shouting will take place if you got
[22:59] so hungry for God speaking in tongues
[23:02] will take place amen hello if you got so
[23:06] hungry for
[23:08] God excuse me you'll just keep on
[23:14] hungering oh come on I'm G read that
[23:18] again he said if you got that if you
[23:21] just get so hungry for God shouting will
[23:24] take place if you got so hungry for God
[23:28] Speak and tongues will take place if you
[23:31] got so hungry for God you just keep on
[23:34] hungering Amen keep yourself he says now
[23:38] don't you go seeing yourself getting
[23:39] indifferent just remember look out
[23:41] there's another Spirit trying to work
[23:43] itself in there amen stay right before
[23:46] God humble with travail of
[23:50] Soul yes
[23:54] amen he didn't say travail of Flesh he
[23:57] said travail of of Soul it means it goes
[24:00] deep amen right it goes deep he said
[24:05] just be all that good old that he said I
[24:07] can prove by the Bible that the first
[24:09] time the angel of God went over the land
[24:11] to seal with the Holy Ghost he only
[24:13] sealed those who s cried and SED for the
[24:16] abomination in the city and you know
[24:18] what brother I've got a quote right here
[24:20] he said in N he said during the time of
[24:23] the world uh World War I at the 11th
[24:26] Hour was the hour the whole the angel
[24:30] says
[24:33] stop my servants haven't been
[24:38] hey my servants haven't been seal hold
[24:41] it up you can't end this thing cuz
[24:44] brother Brooks ain't got it yet
[24:48] Hallelujah glory to God Amen don't look
[24:52] at me like I'm crazy cuz I am
[24:56] Hallelujah you look at this thing and he
[24:59] stopped he stopped I was still somewhere
[25:02] in my daddy's
[25:04] Lo hey and God knew that he saw that and
[25:10] he held up time for you and I so if he
[25:15] held up time in the destruction of the
[25:17] world for you don't you know he's going
[25:20] to get it
[25:23] amen woo that seal is yours amen
[25:29] but I said to myself I said what's wrong
[25:31] with
[25:34] people you see this this cap is a seal
[25:39] what good if the seal would be if there
[25:42] was nothing in
[25:44] it a seal going to seal something
[25:48] up amen right people oh I got this Holy
[25:51] Ghost I got the sealing all come on
[25:53] somebody it's more to the Holy Ghost
[25:56] than Faith amen faith is just down here
[26:00] this body got to be filled all the way
[26:02] up same Holy Ghost same virtues but God
[26:07] can't seal it to the Bott is full
[26:10] Hallelujah to all the character of God
[26:14] is in you yeah it is the seal the Bible
[26:17] said it is the spirit of adoption amen
[26:20] it is the spirit that's going to bring
[26:22] you up the ladder amen if you let him
[26:25] yes amen amen
[26:29] if you let
[26:30] him but you got to be tested Galatians
[26:34] says you got to be toed by whom the Holy

[49:04] dictionary cuz you and I wouldn't have
[49:06] no idea what those words meant in
[49:10] English y'all hear what I'm saying
[49:13] that's why it cannot come by intellect
[49:16] it got to come by Revelation
[49:19] amen who would have known and I don't
[49:21] know why I'm on this RM but who would
[49:23] have known Abraham and Sarah turned back
[49:26] Young the Bible never said it directly
[49:32] amen but the man who wrote
[49:35] it was able to come and show
[49:38] us amen what was in the
[49:42] book and told us a
[49:45] story that why God turned him back young
[49:48] he just didn't turn him young said he
[49:51] but he gave he gave he gave uh uh uh uh
[49:55] Sarah new
[49:57] milk glands gave her a new womb and
[50:01] reproduction system come on somebody
[50:03] gave her a new
[50:05] everything hello and so God comes right
[50:08] around and he's telling us listen I
[50:10] ain't just changing you cuz if I just
[50:13] changeed you back young you still
[50:15] wouldn't fit in heaven that's right
[50:18] amen you still defected you you you you
[50:22] you you can't make it I got to change
[50:24] everything about you your whole makeup
[50:27] must be
[50:32] changed oh Lord that's the truth
[50:36] amen the whole world going to be changed
[50:38] you know that yes sir and when that fire
[50:41] baptism come it's going to burn
[50:42] everything out of it that ain't supposed
[50:45] to be now I don't even know how after
[50:47] that is going to Blossom and the seed's
[50:49] going to
[50:51] survive but the word of God tells us how
[50:53] this thing will become a paradise I
[50:56] don't understand
[51:00] this did you know God can take the life
[51:02] of a dog and put it in a rock and make
[51:04] the rock bark
[51:12] amen that's the
[51:16] truth God can do that cuz it ain't the
[51:18] rock that's live it's the life that's in
[51:20] the
[51:21] Rock That's What Makes You Different see
[51:24] what I'm saying you're an animal
[51:27] am right but you become God when God
[51:30] puts his life in you so God makes an
[51:33] animal
[51:38] God yeah however you want to analyze it
[51:41] that's where it is he lows himself down
[51:43] to our and puts himself in a piece of
[51:46] dust and
[51:47] lives even scientists know there's a God
[51:51] Particle I love that I love that saying
[51:53] God Particle every time I think about it
[51:55] I think about me
[51:57] yeah I am floating around here and they
[51:59] don't even know
[52:00] it amen it's true can I go along can I
[52:05] move on Ezekiel 43 and2 it says behold
[52:08] the glory of the Lord God of Israel came
[52:10] from the way of the East and his voice
[52:13] was like the noise of many Waters and
[52:15] the Earth shine with his glory I said
[52:18] Ezekiel was in our day Ezekiel Saw the
[52:21] voice of many Waters come on somebody he
[52:23] saw the Bride of Jesus Christ hello amen
[52:27] and it said and according to the
[52:28] appearance of the vision which I saw
[52:30] even according to the vision that I saw
[52:32] when I came to destroy the city and the
[52:35] Visions were like the visions that I saw
[52:37] by the river chear and I fell upon my
[52:41] face Now understand Ezekiel is talking
[52:44] talking about amen he says and when I
[52:46] came to destroy the city now I want you
[52:48] to understand something took place when
[52:52] God told brother Brandon to throw those
[52:53] rocks up in the air and he threw those
[52:56] rocks up in the air and a whirlwind
[52:59] came something took place and he then
[53:02] said judgment has now struck the west
[53:06] coast and he said see which way it went
[53:08] it went straight out and is headed back
[53:11] East that's what he said now where is
[53:14] most of the destruction happening now in
[53:16] the East see but he coming back this way
[53:20] how comes it's coming back this way amen
[53:25] and you and I must understand we must be
[53:27] ready and
[53:30] prepared like there was a death angel
[53:32] for Le deia there's a death angel for
[53:35] this age
[53:37] amen yes sir it's coming and the glory
[53:40] of the Lord came into the house by the
[53:41] way of the Gat whose Prospect is toward
[53:44] the East so the spirit took me up and
[53:47] brought me into the inner court and
[53:49] behold the glory of the Lord fill the
[53:51] house this is what he said and I heard
[53:54] him speaking unto me out of of the house
[53:58] and the man stood by
[54:03] me
[54:04] W amen the man stood by me so you got to
[54:09] understand amen what was he saying I
[54:11] heard the voice from the house but he
[54:14] was the man amen amen in other words God
[54:17] was showing in tyght the house
[54:19] represents the man and the voice is
[54:21] coming out of a man
[54:24] amen oh come on some some this is good
[54:27] stuff to me right amen but he goes on
[54:32] and talks about the place of the throne
[54:33] and the place of the soul of my feet
[54:35] where I will dwell in the midst of the
[54:37] children of of Israel and my Holy Name
[54:40] shall the house of Israel no more
[54:45] defile neither they nor their kings by
[54:48] the EM nor by the caucuses of their
[54:50] kings in their high
[54:53] places in other words God said I'm going
[54:55] to fix it
[54:57] so no man can defile it ever again right
[55:01] okay now here's the scripture amen was
[55:04] shared by the our brother Keith which is
[55:06] a real blessing Deuteronomy 4:9 and I
[55:09] I'm GNA close on this in just a
[55:12] moment I don't mind you sharing
[55:14] scriptures anybody whoever and if the
[55:17] Lord prompt me I'll use it if he doesn't
[55:19] I
[55:20] won't but this one was really good and
[55:23] and I've been really it's been it was a
[55:25] a real blessing in to me uh uh because
[55:27] of some of the trials that came my way
[55:30] after this scripture was
[55:32] shared and it's Deuteronomy 4 and N only
[55:36] take heed to
[55:38] thyself and keep thy Soul
[55:41] diligently lest thou forget the things
[55:46] which thine eyes have seen and lest they
[55:50] depart from thy heart all the days of
[55:53] thy life but teach them thy sons and thy
[55:58] son's
[56:02] Sons he said keep them
[56:04] diligently lest they depart come on

[56:22] will forget it that's why he told Israel
[56:24] remember this remember remember remember
[56:27] remember always remember he said

[56:58] to surrender something to
[57:00] God and I surrendered everything my
[57:04] will my
[57:06] ways my
[57:08] thoughts my
[57:10] efforts CU I was constantly getting in
[57:13] his
[57:14] way remember I said the other day I said

[58:37] thought when God stopped leading you how
[58:39] you going to go any further right amen
[58:43] right it becomes difficult no don't get
[58:46] me wrong if if you ought to push through
[58:48] that he'll lead you to push through that

[58:57] a man 40 days without failure he can
[58:59] lead you two days or

[1:02:40] by denying your
[1:02:45] flesh you can call it fasting you can
[1:02:47] call whatever it is but you deny your
[1:02:49] flesh when you afflict your soul
[1:02:59] and offer an offering made by
[1:03:07] fire you know what that means
[1:03:10] folks
[1:03:13] fire there something about fire that's
[1:03:17] exciting I don't care if you looking for
[1:03:19] looking at it from a distance is just
[1:03:21] something that me mesmerizes us
[1:03:23] something that fascinates us you know
[1:03:26] something about fire really wants to
[1:03:28] pull you
[1:03:29] in but you get so close your flesh is
[1:03:32] not so but it does I don't know whether
[1:03:35] y'all know what I'm talking about but
[1:03:36] there's something about fire you just
[1:03:37] wish you could walk in it oh y'all don't
[1:03:40] know what I'm talking about but
[1:03:42] anyway I've had that experience of
[1:03:45] looking at a fire and wanting to just
[1:03:47] move but you know your flesh know that
[1:03:48] you'll be
[1:03:50] burned without
[1:03:53] faith but with faith you can walk
[1:03:55] straight through a fire and never
[1:03:56] receive one burn amen and you don't even
[1:03:59] have to be a Christian to do that
[1:04:02] Muslims do it all the time walk on coals
[1:04:05] of fire never burnt takes a sword amen
[1:04:08] and raming through them and comes out on
[1:04:10] the other side it ain't no fake sword is
[1:04:12] real no blood no whatsoever why faith
[1:04:14] can move those things Faith Taps into
[1:04:17] another dimension and work through it
[1:04:20] see what I'm
[1:04:22] saying and am I'm I'm almost done
[1:04:27] so we look at this thing and we say okay
[1:04:29] now how how do we come to a place where
[1:04:31] we don't
[1:04:32] work when you can come to a place and
[1:04:35] contact God on a daily basis and say
[1:04:38] Lord live through
[1:04:40] me it's not I that live but Christ that
[1:04:42] lives through me right Lord I deny
[1:04:46] myself today I want you to tell me what
[1:04:50] to do you be my Lord yes sir
[1:04:56] all right you be my Lord I want to do
[1:04:59] just what you say do if you don't want
[1:05:01] me to move out of the house I'll stay
[1:05:02] right there see I don't want my mind my
[1:05:05] thoughts my nothing I want whatever you
[1:05:07] want me to do
[1:05:09] am you think God want to do that yes he
[1:05:12] will God told that one woman he said I'm
[1:05:14] going to send you Elijah but you go out
[1:05:16] there and wait by the
[1:05:17] fence and she waited for
[1:05:20] hours Faith said he was going to come
[1:05:23] she re it was revealed to her he's
[1:05:25] coming and she got out there early
[1:05:27] enough so she wouldn't miss him not that
[1:05:30] he might not come I'm going to be here
[1:05:32] when he comes I'll see him coming see
[1:05:35] that's what faith does oh not that God
[1:05:37] ain't gonna meet I'm going to be there
[1:05:39] and when it comes I'll be right there
[1:05:41] when it comes amen all right remember I
[1:05:44] forgot what story that was brother B
[1:05:46] said that that uh the he had to go
[1:05:48] around the corner for something and this
[1:05:50] lady God told her to go stand on the
[1:05:52] corner brother bradam going to come this
[1:05:53] way
[1:05:56] see so I wasn't just working for the
[1:05:57] prophet it was working for the woman too
[1:06:00] yes sir right it'll work for you God
[1:06:02] will tell you to do something you just
[1:06:04] go do it you don't have to he don't have
[1:06:06] to explain it
[1:06:07] amen I just believe that if God told you
[1:06:11] amen that listen you are you asked for
[1:06:13] this new car let's just use that for an
[1:06:15] example sound Conor but maybe you can
[1:06:18] understand if God say listen you go
[1:06:20] stand on the corner of Hickman and and
[1:06:22] and 86 and I'm going to send somebody by
[1:06:24] with a new car they just going to hand
[1:06:26] you the keys and the
[1:06:27] title I guarantee you if you really
[1:06:30] believe that you stand there from sun up
[1:06:32] to sun
[1:06:36] down if it's revealed to you you know
[1:06:39] God said
[1:06:40] it you'll stand right there and guess
[1:06:43] what you think the devil gonna make it
[1:06:45] easy for you that'll probably be the day
[1:06:47] of the
[1:06:51] rain you think he going to make it easy
[1:06:53] for you Amen to be a day amen Hil come
[1:06:56] from
[1:06:57] somewhere it's not going to make it easy
[1:06:59] for you but your point is you got to
[1:07:03] wait and stay there till Jesus come and
[1:07:07] so I'm going to close on this there's
[1:07:09] only one
[1:07:10] Covenant for this day in for us to live
[1:07:13] and that's the abrahamic
[1:07:16] Covenant and that Covenant was given to
[1:07:18] us by way of ham or God himself right
[1:07:24] y'all know ham means god
[1:07:26] that's the part I'm working with so he
[1:07:28] comes along and he gives out
[1:07:30] unconditional Covenant and according to
[1:07:31] Hebrews the Bible say he could swear by
[1:07:33] no
[1:07:34] greater he made a oath to
[1:07:37] himself I'll do it for you now I don't
[1:07:41] know whether y'all believe it I do I'm
[1:07:44] just dumb enough to do it Hallelujah
[1:07:47] there's only one bread and one
[1:07:50] body and the world don't have
[1:07:52] it when God came down here he came us
[1:07:56] came and gave us Mana bread that was
[1:08:00] hidden from ages for ages behind the
[1:08:04] veil and put it on tapes and books and
[1:08:08] said
[1:08:11] eat if you eat this you'll
[1:08:17] live don't you see what I'm saying see
[1:08:20] what God did they can't live cuz they're
[1:08:23] not living off the bloody ble
[1:08:26] word of God they
[1:08:29] can't they living from Mana of a manner
[1:08:32] of a old day and the Bible said it
[1:08:33] rocked it died the life left
[1:08:38] it it was only the Mana that was behind
[1:08:41] the veil where the life never left it
[1:08:43] that's why the prophet could be gone for
[1:08:45] so many years and the life still lives
[1:08:48] it still
[1:08:50] lives because that's Mana from behind
[1:08:52] the
[1:08:54] veil one blood one life one Holy Ghost

[1:09:00] Ghost ain't no
