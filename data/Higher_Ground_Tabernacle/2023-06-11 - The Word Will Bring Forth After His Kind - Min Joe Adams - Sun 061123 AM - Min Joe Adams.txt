Lord this morning it's been many years it's good to come home Isaac God bless you mother is Rich would you reach for the key for this is the years have passed we're still holding the line well Isaiah thank you for holding us here thank you for holding the line here I see you God's gonna have a bride every Kindred the tribe amen we are that bride you are that Brian that's the reason to Rejoice this morning I didn't call so we send greetings to you from our church our pastor brother Tim um brother Isaiah thank you for the invitation to have us here this morning glad to have my family with me I'm glad to have him with us this morning [Music] you have your Bibles we're going to look here in the Book of John first chapter first verse and I want to speak to you by the way on the word will bring forth so notice the word will bring forth after his cast in space John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and drought among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's pray father we come before your throne of mercy and Grace this morning Lord thank you for the opportunity you've given us father to come in your presence and we pray that you will speak to his father this morning not our ears that we may hear this morning he could pass what the spirit will have to be said you can have your seats this morning so we find in John 1 and verse 1. the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was gone so let's go back to the beginning and find out about this so we go to Genesis 1 and verse 11. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb building seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so much and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good it is verse 20 you will see and God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has lies the foul that may fly above the Earth in upon the firming of the heaven and God created the wells and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged foul after his kind and and God saw that it was good results and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so this is and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything they creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good Jews so we find God here creating and everything came forth after their kind but God has yet to create the most important aspect of his creation verse 26. we got seven seas God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God God created he him male and female created heed them so we go back to the the exposition of the church ages brother Branham tells us in the beginning was the word and that word there translates to a a to the word logos it means a thought or a Concepts it also means a thought or a speech so an adult that's expressed is a word correct and brother Ram says now John says that the concept of God was expressed in Jesus so in the beginning was the concept of God in the beginning what's the thoughts of God in the beginning God was in the form of creation or the Act of Creation look like so in the beginning you were there you were there in the beginning before your trial before the sickness before the hurts before the disappointment you were there you were in the beginning God is gonna bring forth what is God bringing foreign hey man so we find here we come to Jesus to logos he was the perfect and complete thought Express and he became known as the word that's what he is and forever will be so God said let us lesser make man in our image oh God dwelt Alone in the eternities you were in his mind you become a word spoken in this hour said let us create man in our image let me tell you this morning Brothers this is [Applause] [Applause] this morning let's go to Ephesians in chapter one and verse three says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ notice who hath blessed us with Allah not a portion not a peace some people they got a portion of it oh yeah just a small piece but we hear and Paul is telling us that he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings so can we look at this just for a minute he says now we are in Christ we have spiritual blessings foreign Spirit trailer outside of Christ we have Sensations in Christ we have positive blessings not make believe the the Christians not Shams and put ons he says but as long as you're trying to say that you're in the promised land and you're not your sins will find you out the first thing you know you'll find out yourself a phony you'll find out that you're not what you're talking about but when you're in Christ he's promised you Heavenly places [Music] you're in the promised land and in full possession of everything so he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings so the same Holy Ghost a fell on the day of Pentecost it's here this morning you can't separate it the same response on Pentacles the same emotions that came at Pentecost because he was determined I'm gonna bring forth are Sons and Daughters of God and though I went through seven Church ages we are here oh church are you hear me this morning I said we are here that bride is here we're not manifesting our own ideas he said the same holy ghost that made Mary shout and speak in tongues and have a wonderful time it's the same Holy Ghost here this morning so if it can make Mary shout I don't see perfect why should it do for us this morning put your ideas let me be that manifest notice that blessing he says blessing us with what listen to what you're blessed with this morning Divine Healing brother brother [Applause] Venus once rude your life when high blood pressure once attacked you you have a promise this morning you have been blessed with Divine Healing with foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] he can't speak anything else he can't come up with a better better thought so you are the perfect thought of God when you get up in the morning Brothers thank you my thumb yellow [Applause] so once his word is spoken some of you worried about the grave there's no sense of worrying about it you lay this body down but one day brother's coming up Eternal thoughts of God see his word can no more die than he can die that's why in the beginning John said what's the word put yourself back there in the beginning shake off what happened to you last week oh don't worry about tomorrow and I'm looking at the family again every seed had to bring forth of its cars and God has brought forth and God is bringing foreign [Applause] the only one yeah experience where are you with the truth come on Joe where are you we're the sons of God hallelujah so that you can bring foreign all right glory to God it's all right this morning oh praise the Lord Roger C program says Amanda is born of the spirit of God and then he becomes in the image of god notice where it takes place down into the heart into the soul and then from there your life begins to materialize this word that's why you can't smoke another cigarette men dress like women women dresses and the word can only produce summer oh let me foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] means that light will produce light so species are fixed you can't breathe a banana with a human let me say it like this you can't breed denominational believer with The Real Son of God because the word can only bring forth of the words see God created every species distinct from one another one so the the theory of evolution it's the nod right there see we're all different our species are different and God said it 10 times in Genesis 1. everything produces are increases so if you plant corn you don't expect to get bananas dude [Applause] I said what do you get all right so if you plant mangoes you get what a dog will produce what God producer if it has to stay there and the human can produce a human yeah see God can't change times may change society may change but this word I said this word Remains the Same so life comes from the seeds let's just look at this for a few minutes this morning every seeds carries within it all the potentials and the promise of what it can become see it carries the Prototype of what it will be so you can take a young man and you can look at his father yo we got this one and you can say well that is gonna become that because that seed of the father and so the attributes in the sun attributes of the father prepare carries within it all the information that it needs to grow complete healthy human it was something a healthy plant or a healthy animals so take an apple seed you planted in the ground and what happens an apple tree grows but that's not the end of the Apple Store no you keep watering it foreign uh [Music] [Music] keep applying the words you keep pouring on the spirit don't you know obviously do this please I say one day in the right atmosphere looks like it was dead if Memphis ah the spirit of God so if you plant an apple seed and it produces apples let's think about a human for a minute the Bible says that you are created in the image of God because now look at your neighbor that's God some of you went but that's gone Missy Drew you were created in His image [Music] this morning but you are in the image of God his likeness it's off to see that God is inside of you I don't see that everything that God is every attribute that's in the mind of God oh think about this for a minute you are created in the image of God you are the highest form of God's creation some of you think you're just a mass of Flesh you're just occupying a seat but you're not here by accident you're not here by mistake you're here because the word has called you to be this is to be right here in Iowa this morning let your word be formed in me [Music] Hallelujah every trait secretary that was in the father I'm a father that's my son stand up son left while peace handsome young man so all that is in me is in him then we don't look alike we don't look alike but we had the same mannerisms so every trait that's in the father the color of your eyes the complexion of your skin how tall you are tired how short you are how much hair you have um your makeup uh okay we're moving out your personality personality whether you're mean whether you're sweet whether you're loving because whether you're a driven Persona or whether you're a lazy person is all in the seed seeing if that's in the natural what about the spirit if that's in the natural and your Offspring can't produce you can produce your same makeup can produce your same mannerisms can produce your same traits then what about when the mind of God comes down [Music] in the father healing was in the father oh long suffering amen so we find that the seed has life but in this hour the seed's been hybrid and we find that Eve she had the original word but she took a lot of the enemy and when she did she hybrid the seeds the word hybrid here it means an offspring of two animals or plants a different subspecies so you got a donkey and you got a horse so you have a donkey and you have a horse and it produces a mule um and so what I'm telling you this morning the denominational seed is it can breed itself back to the original word but because you come from the original word because you are that original word you're gonna bring forth original words your life is going to produce the words that's why you can say Amen this morning that's why you can jump this morning that's why you can shout this morning and it's coming forth now brother Brown tells us that the first heartbreaking took place in Genesis 3. when he believed the LIE of the serpenter foreign but he didn't have a place for a soul even though he was a distinct different species he was still a man and brother bam tells us that Satan mixed his he came down into the serpenter and he mixed his seed with the human race the Bible tells us that he was the most subtle Rose um cunning wisdom he was right next to man the most subtle of all the beasts of the fields tells us he goes I went and I got the dictionaries and I wanted to see what the word subtle meant it means to be smart it means to be crafty um but the best interpretation is the Hebrew word m-a-h-a-h- and it means having a true knowledge of the principles of life so Satan had the true knowledge but the principles of life he knew how those others brought forth life and so he introduced this Concepts however but he was supposed to bring forth of the spoken word but she listened to the lie and anytime you listen to the lies it brings death so we find the serpent was so close to man that Satan interjected with one purpose cut the sea line off cut that sea lion off see Satan was there when God said let us make man in our image Satan was there and he knew that God had desires to have a family so in order he knew he could not create but he had the possession to pervert he is doing man wants to be a woman want to be men children want to be cats the and the sad part brother if there's been laws that are passed that protect these desires you can't tell that child that he's not a dog that he's not a dog even though he looks like a man looks like a boy talks like a boy walks like a boy but he's identified himself and that their laws being passed for that is [Music] the word has called you in this house you're only coming to manifest foreign [Music] yeah this is on the cup okay and 31 states have passed laws to allow Force sterilizations notice what Satan is also done he's propagated the transgender movement so it's one thing for the homosexual movement but the homosexual can repent and he can straighten his life for her life up and they can live with the opposite sexual position but the transgender they undergo they undergo surgeries and hormone therapies to change their gender all together this causes realization sterilization there's no way to bring forth the seed at that point is even young children can decide what gender they want to be um so ignoring the natural parts of their body they can choose what they want to be it's in an effort it's only four to destroy the sea lion see Satan has established also the use of pronouns where we would say him and her now instead them and theirs is this is the hour in which we're living see that seed can't bring forth constantly die but the word I said but the word that's why you're here you're not bringing forth but you are bringing forth him and she Louis because when God created man he created them male and female God calls a distinction and that word is still in effect today right that's right well the BAM says in the spoken words the original scene what was he talking about God found on the jury he made himself a man God was made flesh and throughout the Mungus the word was made flesh God's spoken word through a virgin brought forth a body is and that body come it's according the water the spirit is Washed by the Water of the word and then went into him dwelt in him and there come the life of God manifesting himself through Christ [Music] see God was in Christ means the anointed one a man that was anointed and God was dwelling in him he said what was it the germ with the flesh dollar share the anointed one Lua the flesh being Anointed with the spirit of God um produced the word that God May manifest and we beheld him they only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so the word is a seed but as long as it lays here see but when it comes down into here then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit by The Works of God and when he comes in here then Visions come then power comes can you get past all your no- at all you become nothing and Christ becomes alive in you you died he lives I said you die and he lives see he died that I may live and he lives again brother sister he's living right here in Des Moines Iowa he's living right here in your lane your flesh he's living in your life in your home in your school on your job because he is manifesting himself through you and notice what the word says Romans 8 11. but that the spirit of him that raised up Jesus he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you see God made his first bride ground this is in the message the rising of the signs he was both man and woman in spirit he formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material notice he took not another piece of clay but he took the same piece of clay the mems of the darzilla and what he done in the beginning he does it again in the end he doesn't take another piece or another human he takes us the same aspect he be in the bridegroom you be in the bride you come from God and if you come from God we're going back to God so it doesn't matter what we go through down here we know where we're going Hallelujah he says so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone [Music] then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh because the same spirit that was in him quickens us quickens the seed on the inside it produces him the Bible says in John 1 and verse 12. but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God even to them that believed on his name notice verse 13. which were born which were born was it me not a blood no do song nor the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God oh Church the scripture is playing but the spirit doesn't Quicken every seeds it only quickens that predestinated sins it only quickens those that were in the thoughts of God see the spirit was sent to Quicken those seeds hey like to see laid upon the Earth the one that had life in them he said many of them were dead Waters and things burnt them out he said but you know there was a sea laying there ready for life and God knows that it was there but the predestinated ones are the ones to be quick see the sun went across the Earth not to bring rocks not to bring the dirt but to bring that part of the dirt which was enclosed around that life says not all men will receive Christ but those that were which were which were God foreign he quickens them now the dirt will lay there and it will say the sun is too hot The Rock will lay there oh the sun is too hot but right next [Music] she said that's exactly what I need that's exactly what I want Church foreign thank you Sister Crystal think about it look back over your life he had every reason to quit every reason to throw your hands up oh but there was a seed that was deposited on the inside temperature you don't have enough Diablo you're getting the atmosphere right now you're here today [Applause] yeah amen God sent us a message and this message is Christopher and what is it doing it's quick and easy it's quickening predestinated mother says why won't all people receive it because I wasn't sent to them some of y'all need to just pick your back up and realize who you are you ate the trotting down absolutely see you're not to defeated no but you are the predestinated sons and daughters of God oh he's the king of a tribe [Applause] [Applause] but it's for you [Applause] [Applause] on the [Applause] way see it's not meant for everybody says the guy told me he says I don't believe I don't care what you said he said you could raise up the dead or anything heal the sick and prove it anyway because I still don't believe it is certainly not something you're a non-believer It Don't Mean a Thing to you it wasn't said to you isn't to who will believe that's why you're here that's why you're here with so many quit believing and they walked away [Music] here's the word it's like an eagle in a chicken yard you couldn't eat that mess you weren't happy in the Baptist Church I said one day you heard that eagle screens she recognizes foreign how beautiful how beautiful is this message that we have coming out Mount View he hit it he hit it from the wise and he's revealed to babes Amen to those that would receive to those that had that predestinated in Christ The Mystery of God revealed says predestinated there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else was on the earth before he blew the solar systems off his hands um he said you see his great mystery do you voice to call me still that he chose the bride knowing that Eve would fall from disbelieving the words knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold you that word regardless of what the rest of the world had to say about it they hold to the word they are predestinated to stand there to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stance don't you see today Church and that's the mystery you're the mystery that is now being unfolded um Christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church see you bring himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his body notice bringing forth a prize that came from his own body so what happened in the pre-figure now he says he opened up Adam's side and he took part of his flesh yes he says now the bride has to be the words because he is she cannot stand on Creeds she cannot stand on the nomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from Christ now we find in Matthew 24 and verse 24. Maybe much longer Matthew 24 and verse 24. for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and they should show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elected now brother Brown says in the church age he said that the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts that's why we dance because we're just we're just emulating what the first church did this wouldn't be something we staggered out of High Ground Tabernacle this morning why he said we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of Truth in the last day uh oh no account no for the scripture says very clearly in Matthew 24 24.7 cannot be deceived see notice now the Antichrist shall be so close to deceive the very elects says what is the elected he says when that light shines the s-o-n or The Sun Shines on the seat that's governed by botany life and when the Son of God Shines on that predestinated scene it will come to life that quick he goes I don't care what state of life it's in it is might be a prostitute might be a drunkard or a gambler but it will shine at that minute as soon as it strikes him [Music] foreign amen cannot be deceived see the real genuine predestinated seed will catch the word so whenever the light strikes that predestined predestinated scene um oh that's wonderful he says you you can't keep it he says when that seed is laying there and the sun strikes it it went uh it will come to life and the Son of God is the controller of eternal life it is and if you got seed of life in you this is when the son strikes there and shows you that that he is there's no way listen there's no way come on there's no way to keep that life from coming as long as you hear the message foreign odyssip they're all there because they had a word go wait until you've been dude [Music] so you were doing a gotta work a physio card I drew but just imagine the work was
