[44:21] you know I've got to have one of these
[44:22] when I get there
[44:28] [Music]
[44:32] it was a dream
[44:36] of my life but in this dream I saw it
[44:39] alsoever the Lord Jesus
[44:43] and we were entering into the Gates of
[44:47] Heaven
[44:48] [Music]
[44:51] it was there when I saw the gate close
[44:55] [Music]
[44:56] family and Jesus stood there
[45:00] and I saw a lot of people just rejoicing
[45:04] going into the gate
[45:08] and the whole time he was staring at me
[45:13] not watching the other people
[45:16] and I was wondering what that was
[45:20] I wasn't in the message at that time
[45:24] but now I do understand
[45:27] what the dream was all about circular
[45:31] empathy I believe with all my heart
[45:34] that the dream was of the Lord until
[45:37] he'll have it to you because in a in a
[45:40] split second
[45:41] so when everybody else moved in
[45:45] I stood there Jesus in me
[45:49] and before oh I could think a good
[45:53] thought yeah I was right in front of him
[45:57] and he took me by the waist and my
[46:00] people like a man with a woman
[46:03] and he Lifted Me Up
[46:06] and he kissed me on my lips see my um
[46:10] I woke up shouting
[46:13] and praising God
[46:16] want you and the anointing of God was so
[46:19] on me
[46:21] I ran out of my room
[46:24] into my mother's room
[46:27] and I told her of my dreams
[46:31] I'm really scared her because it was in
[46:33] the middle of the night
[46:36] and she said praise the Lord
[46:40] the Lord is called my son to
[46:44] preacher that was the worst thing she
[46:46] could have said to me
[46:48] because I never wanted to be a preacher
[46:52] never wanted to be a pastor
[46:55] foreign
[47:02] [Music]
[47:13] [Music]
[47:25] [Music]
[47:37] [Music]
[47:47] [Music]
[47:48] my life became miserable
[47:53] and the last stupid thing I ever did
[47:56] Daniel's so stupid
[47:58] I had a gun to my head it's a very large
[48:01] trying to kill myself
[48:04] and God would not let the gun go off
[48:09] memories it was very frustrating to give
[48:12] him offers I said Lord
[48:15] if you don't kill me tradition somebody
[48:19] will kill me or I will kill myself
[48:23] [Music]
[48:25] God heard my cry
[48:29] and he saved me according to his grace
[48:32] hey my soul
[48:36] I know what it means to be in bondage
[48:39] I know what it means to be delivered
[48:42] [Music]

[52:54] amen amen you may be seated
[52:59] foreign
[53:15] I cannot express the urgency
[53:22] how many of us this morning
[53:24] fought the devil before you got here
[53:28] um
[53:31] well at least I'm going to raise my hand
[53:33] and tell on him this was really in my
[53:36] mind every day you have a battle with
[53:39] the devil sex jealous
[53:42] and if you don't have a battle you're
[53:45] stupid
[53:46] that means you're not in a
[53:49] Warner like yeah
[53:51] but when I think about
[53:53] it
[53:54] this end time message
[53:57] and what God did through our prophet and
[54:00] circled and how he labored
[54:05] to get this message to us
[54:10] for those of us who have heard the
[54:13] message
[54:14] on the wings of a snow white dove Don
[54:17] Colombo
[54:20] Blanche combination you heard how
[54:22] brother Branham was Advantage
[54:25] tells the story about
[54:27] this Dove that was the six column to
[54:31] bring a message
[54:33] and how the dove was wounded in battle
[54:40] and you can tell that brother Branham
[54:42] was
[54:43] speaking of his own himself
[54:47] and the struggles he's had and his
[54:50] employees bringing this message to us
[54:54] matter of fact at the end of that
[54:56] particular message
[54:57] brother Brandon is literally crying
[55:02] I can feel the pain I could feel the
[55:04] hurt
[55:05] I can hear the sincerity
[55:08] but one of the things that really caught
[55:11] my attention
[55:13] in spite of the wounded dove burn Parts
[55:19] brother Brandon said the message got
[55:21] home
[55:24] so in this day we know that there are
[55:28] some people
[55:29] who are not going to be heroes of the
[55:32] word but also doers yes
[55:38] brother Adam tells us in spiritual food
[55:40] in due season
[55:47] he said there is nothing left but
[55:50] judgment
[55:52] and he said when we step over judgment
[55:58] he tells us amen that the the line of
[56:01] Mercy
[56:02] let me read it like he said there's
[56:04] nothing left
[56:06] but judgment when you step over the line
[56:10] of Mercy records
[56:14] and when I think about the mercies of
[56:17] God
[56:19] Mercy is when you're guilty that means
[56:22] they're called conversation you've been
[56:24] judged you've been tried and you're
[56:27] guilty
[56:28] and you receive Mercy that means that he
[56:32] calls hallelujah hallelujah now
[56:35] in this warning
[56:38] he was trying to share with us
[56:42] that there's coming a time
[56:45] when the grace of God
[56:48] is shut off
[56:51] hello I will say it again
[56:55] he was trying to warn us
[56:57] that's this amazing grace that we sing
[57:01] about because it's right
[57:08] Grace is not eternal
[57:13] hello
[57:14] Grace is not Eternal
[57:18] Grace was given to us after the fall
[57:21] apart
[57:24] amen amen and we find out
[57:28] that when Jesus died
[57:32] he was literally dying for you and me
[57:37] Hallelujah this is why we can sit here
[57:40] today
[57:41] proclaiming to be Christians
[57:45] and we're still living
[57:47] it's because we have lived all of the
[57:52] grace and mercy of God
[57:54] but God has an order
[57:58] somehow Grace can run out La graspe uh
[58:03] is that not what brother random said God
[58:07] will continue to warn you and warn you
[58:10] and warn you and he said but there is a
[58:13] line
[58:14] once you cross over the line God will no
[58:19] longer warn you and the only thing left
[58:22] for you is Judgment Hallelujah
[58:27] just the other day I preached on the key
[58:31] to full Authority and power
[58:34] clearly full
[58:39] so that you'll understand
[58:43] God took us out of what we call the
[58:46] Pentecostal realm
[58:47] or the Pentecostal age per se
[58:51] and when he brought us out he brought us
[58:55] out with a new message
[58:57] and with the new message
[59:00] comes a new song yeah Universal songs is
[59:03] that right because remember when Moses
[59:07] took the children of Israel
[59:09] out of Egypt
[59:12] once they got over on the other side
[59:16] they sung a new song Hallelujah
[59:32] and she began to worship God in a new
[59:36] way
[59:37] Hallelujah see they may have worshiped
[59:40] God
[59:41] in Egypt on Egypt but they were
[59:44] worshiping under the uh under bondage
[59:50] Hallelujah but when when they came over
[59:55] you understand me when it came over and
[59:59] they saw the enemy dead
[1:00:02] there was no boundaries
[1:00:05] Moses began to sing a new song
[1:00:08] Hallelujah is that right and we remember
[1:00:11] the prophet of God
[1:00:15] she began
[1:00:17] prophetess of God Miriam she began to
[1:00:21] play her tambourine
[1:00:39] millions of women
[1:00:42] with their voices
[1:00:45] shouting and praising God
[1:00:48] hallelujah it was not a quiet moment
[1:00:53] Karma
[1:00:55] Hallelujah
[1:00:58] when the lamb took the book
[1:01:01] I'm jumping now but when the land took
[1:01:05] the book
[1:01:06] first of all we realized there was no
[1:01:09] man worthy
[1:01:12] no man worthy
[1:01:14] you're not worthy you weren't worthy
[1:01:19] I was not worthy to take the book or to
[1:01:24] lose the seals
[1:01:26] Hallelujah and there was John
[1:01:30] who typed out the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:33] hello somebody he was concerned because
[1:01:37] John himself
[1:01:39] knew he was not worthy but then John
[1:01:43] Heard a Voice
[1:01:48] for the lion of the tribe of Judah he
[1:01:52] had prevailed
[1:01:54] see I can tell you heard this before or
[1:01:57] was I protected but nevertheless I'm
[1:01:59] going to preach again
[1:02:01] because when I get to certain parts
[1:02:03] you're gonna wish you had listened
[1:02:05] listening you had paid attention to what
[1:02:07] I'm preaching
[1:02:09] but nevertheless let's move on
[1:02:12] when when when the lamb took the book
[1:02:14] this is what I'm working with
[1:02:16] something was different
[1:02:19] because remember
[1:02:21] when when John goes on kneel to the
[1:02:25] angel
[1:02:28] the angel who was not God
[1:02:31] told John to get up
[1:02:34] and worship God only
[1:02:37] so this is establish a fact that
[1:02:41] everything in heaven
[1:02:44] worship God and God Alone Hallelujah
[1:02:49] so when the bloody lamb came and took
[1:02:53] the book a pillow Leaf what happened uh
[1:02:57] what happened
[1:02:58] the elders ladies and 24 Elders took
[1:03:03] their crowns off
[1:03:06] their faces
[1:03:24] you understand me because the Angels
[1:03:27] would not have bowed to Jesus
[1:04:37] things that hinder our growth this
[1:04:40] surely shows Hallelujah and we've been
[1:04:43] trying to tell you the things that will
[1:04:46] hinder your growth
[1:04:47] are the things that you need to get rid
[1:04:50] of them
[1:04:52] Hallelujah there is a key to Authority
[1:04:55] yeah
[1:04:56] there's a key to power yeah
[1:04:59] Hallelujah is that right yes and the
[1:05:02] Bible tells us that Jesus gave Peter the
[1:05:06] Kings
[1:05:07] hallelujah what was the king he said
[1:05:11] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:05:14] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:05:18] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:05:21] receive what everyone said the Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost
[1:05:24] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost only comes in
[1:05:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:31] there were many people
[1:05:34] because in the name of Father Son and
[1:05:36] Holy Ghost but they did not understand
[1:06:07] but you're not even truly in the message
[1:06:09] until you come to that Hallelujah
[1:06:17] you understand me and if you didn't
[1:06:20] repent
[1:06:21] you still have not come
[1:06:24] Hallelujah because you must repeat it
[1:06:30] Hallelujah is that right if you just got
[1:06:33] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:06:36] went down a wet Center was that and you
[1:06:39] came up I mean you went down a dry
[1:06:41] sitter and you came up a wet sinner oh
[1:06:44] is that that live that's God's father
[1:06:47] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:06:52] what do you mean brother
[1:06:54] Adam I don't in the beginning
[1:06:57] had full Authority and power
[1:07:01] over the Earth Hallelujah
[1:07:05] but the second Adam
[1:07:07] had full authority
[1:07:09] of Heaven and Earth Hallelujah
[1:07:14] and we are created and made after the
[1:07:18] second Adam
[1:07:19] who is Jesus Christ himself what am I
[1:07:23] trying to tell you
[1:07:25] you cannot remain in the condition that
[1:07:30] you are in conditions Hallelujah
[1:07:53] somebody help me here
[1:07:55] because remember
[1:07:57] the spirit or the anointing of this age
[1:08:03] has come to deceive a lot of people
[1:08:06] this uh
[1:08:08] you may have come to this America with
[1:08:11] life
[1:08:12] but the Bible said that the cares of
[1:08:15] this world
[1:08:20] if you're not careful
[1:08:22] you understand what I'm saying you can
[1:08:25] get so busy trying to be something in
[1:08:29] this world
[1:08:33] and you forget the most important thing
[1:08:36] and that is the world to come
[1:08:40] let me go on now full Authority and
[1:08:43] power so when Adam and Eve
[1:08:48] they lost
[1:08:52] Authority and power
[1:08:56] and what was that
[1:08:58] they lost the nature of God
[1:09:04] and throughout all of man's history
[1:09:08] they tried to come back
[1:09:11] to the state from which they had fallen
[1:09:16] but they could never do it
[1:09:18] even when God worked with Israel
[1:09:23] they did everything right he's always
[1:09:26] said he's of two faces some of them do
[1:09:29] Paul said he was blameless
[1:09:34] Hallelujah the Rich Young Ruler said I
[1:09:39] did everything right
[1:09:41] Hallelujah you see it's not enough to
[1:09:43] know the message
[1:09:46] he knows the word he knows the words
[1:09:50] that's got nothing to do with it but do
[1:09:54] you know Christ have you been born again
[1:09:57] do you have the Holy Spirit because
[1:10:00] that's where the life is
[1:10:04] baptize your mind he will place himself
[1:10:08] in your head in your heart
[1:10:11] that's where God resides
[1:10:16] because the Bible says out of the heart
[1:10:20] knows the issues of Life uh so these
[1:10:24] leaves
[1:10:25] Hallelujah you love that amen I'm going
[1:10:29] on now remember I said before
[1:10:33] my whole aim more on objective my desire
[1:10:37] if you see this church on one Accord
[1:10:41] get rid of all of the crazy stuff
[1:10:43] Hallelujah
[1:10:47] hello get rid of all of the crazy stuff
[1:10:51] all over this religion that you think
[1:10:54] you had
[1:10:55] religion is just a covering
[1:10:59] Pharisees had coverings
[1:11:02] when Jesus came he was a discerner of
[1:11:05] the heart and he said you you look like
[1:11:07] white as cut separate on the outside
[1:11:10] white is supplicant on the outside
[1:11:13] you look good
[1:11:16] but inside
[1:11:19] you're a Dead Man's Bones was that uh
[1:11:25] you love the Lord
[1:11:26] I'm gonna go you're gonna find this to
[1:11:28] be really simple when I finish
[1:11:31] but you cannot love God
[1:11:35] if you don't love your brothers
[1:11:40] and I'm not talking about
[1:11:42] video love
[1:11:45] if you're good to me I'll be good to you
[1:11:47] seriously
[1:11:49] but I'm talking about the kind of love
[1:11:52] that has the power
[1:11:55] to change to turn your cheek
[1:12:02] the Bible says if a man slap you ready
[1:12:06] I wouldn't dare try it with any of you
[1:12:09] see
[1:12:13] turn the cheek
[1:12:16] what are you saying make another
[1:12:19] decision
[1:12:21] turn from the decision that you may have
[1:12:24] thought to give back another slap
[1:12:27] yourself we
[1:12:34] ought to make excuses
[1:12:39] oh I'm in the right area
[1:12:46] I know I'm hitting right right right
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:49] let's go to Genesis 4 9. I'm not gonna
[1:12:52] stay in this game but I've got to get
[1:12:53] this first
[1:12:55] because let me say it like this you

[1:13:07] done wrong to you okay
[1:13:11] you need to love your soul

[1:13:21] I don't care is there more food what
[1:13:25] someone else has what someone has done
[1:13:27] wrong to you the circle can't come with
[1:13:28] that fair though you need to love your
[1:13:31] soul
[1:13:32] I'm more than you love to hate someone
[1:13:37] am I making sense

[1:13:44] because we realize amen nothing unclean
[1:13:47] will enter into it
[1:13:52] you love God Amen y'all believe that God
[1:13:55] is trying to build character in us
[1:13:58] and this is what I'm trying to say God
[1:14:00] is trying to build characters
[1:14:04] I I want you to I don't take sides with
[1:14:06] people

[1:14:22] Wouldn't Die for
[1:14:24] um

[1:14:27] correct and God is my judge for that
[1:14:32] first of all I'm not afraid to die
[1:14:36] and I know I have the eternal life of
[1:14:39] God in Me

[1:16:20] he put you there to be a light yeah
[1:16:25] hello somebody
[1:16:28] let's read it beginning at the ninth
[1:16:30] verse
[1:16:31] and the Lord said unto Cain
[1:16:34] is
[1:16:36] where is where is Abel thy brother
[1:16:41] night first ninth verse
[1:16:46] and he said I know yeah
[1:16:50] am I My Brother's Keeper Guardian so now
[1:16:55] I'm going to ask you this morning
[1:16:57] are you your brother's keeper
[1:17:02] you answer that
[1:17:04] within your soul
[1:17:07] am I yeah yeah I'm not playing church
[1:17:11] I'm serious about what I'm doing and
[1:17:15] what I'm doing is trying to help you the
[1:17:16] secretary
[1:17:18] how many of us well let me say like this
[1:17:20] last week and the week before last when
[1:17:24] I was here yeah
[1:17:26] I use the illustration of maturity is
[1:17:31] and I shared that maturing is it is
[1:17:35] important for them
[1:17:39] and I use the illustration
[1:17:41] of how when you're spanking a child
[1:17:45] or in adolescence that's immature
[1:17:49] they're going to think that you're being
[1:17:51] mean to them
[1:17:53] oh they'll think that you are punishing
[1:17:56] them
[1:17:57] because they don't understand that you
[1:17:59] have judged the situation
[1:18:03] and your judgment has to bring
[1:18:05] correction
[1:18:08] you understand what I'm saying but once
[1:18:12] you mature you realize that the Judgment
[1:18:16] has been true
[1:18:19] Elizabeth
[1:18:56] said it's not going to rain for three
[1:18:59] and a half years
[1:19:02] until I call for it
[1:19:05] that was the Judgment of the Lord
[1:19:09] Israel had been really wicked
[1:19:13] Ahab and Jezebel and all of that
[1:19:15] accomplishes our belly but in the midst
[1:19:18] of all of that
[1:19:19] if a man was to look at your god

[1:26:03] anybody can go to the store and buy
[1:26:05] something for a dollar that's okay even
[1:26:07] at the dollar store is no longer a
[1:26:09] dollar remember the dollar storage
[1:26:12] I'm just saying now my point is this I'm
[1:26:15] going to something here am I my brothers
[1:26:18] keep us yes you are yeah we who's that
[1:26:22] the Bible says you are
[1:26:24] Jesus says and we are supposed to take
[1:26:28] care of each other
[1:26:30] Hallelujah you understand me and when we
[1:26:35] take care of each other we are not
[1:26:37] supposed to talk about each other
[1:26:40] in a negative way the Bible said bless
[1:26:45] and curse not and every time you speak
[1:26:48] evil against your brother
[1:26:50] laying a curse on him
[1:26:57] ammo
[1:26:59] I'm talking about you you talking about
[1:27:01] making a Rapture
[1:27:04] understand God has your life in his in
[1:27:07] his hands
[1:27:09] he will lead you like Lambs oh he's
[1:27:13] going to drive you like a cattle
[1:27:17] I want to be led like a lamb
[1:27:20] I don't want to be driven
[1:27:23] Hallelujah listen equity
[1:27:27] it I I brought out last week last month
[1:27:31] that hatred is murder
[1:27:36] when you hate someone
[1:27:39] Jesus said it's just like murdering
[1:27:42] someone
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:45] is that the word that's the Bible the
[1:27:49] Bible said if you hate your brother now
[1:27:51] be ready
[1:27:52] it's like being a murderer
[1:27:56] as I said last week magnified along with
[1:28:00] me what what is the law he is the word
[1:28:03] magnify the law with me Hallelujah Jesus
[1:28:07] in this day came to magnify the words
[1:28:10] for the Bride of Jesus so that she will
[1:28:13] be without spots
[1:28:15] Hallelujah so no longer will she be
[1:28:18] Sanctified In the Flesh she'll be
[1:28:20] Sanctified in the spirit and she'll be
[1:28:22] Sanctified in her songs
[1:28:25] is that right
[1:28:29] because the Pharisees needed to know
[1:28:31] something
[1:28:32] and the Pharisees of this message need
[1:28:35] to know something Hallelujah
[1:28:38] he said listen if a man looked upon a
[1:28:41] woman
[1:28:42] in his heart he has already committed
[1:28:47] what was he doing he was
[1:28:50] magnifying the Lord
[1:28:53] magnifying the words taking it from the
[1:28:56] flesh realm and bringing it down into
[1:28:58] spiritual reality and if it's hard if
[1:29:01] it's difficult to overcome adultery or
[1:29:04] fornication In the Flesh how much more
[1:29:07] is more difficult to overcome it in the
[1:29:10] spirit
[1:29:11] when can only spree yes yes you know
[1:29:14] because nobody can't see what you're
[1:29:16] doing spiritually basketball
[1:29:19] and you don't know I'll be watching
[1:29:21] everything it would say you're
[1:29:22] like God too he's upselled too
[1:29:27] see we look at
[1:29:29] it I'm gonna read a few more I'm not
[1:29:31] gonna keep it really really long
[1:29:35] you'll be long potato
[1:29:40] yes will I stay right on time when
[1:29:42] everybody start coming on time
[1:29:46] you see when I say about 45 minutes
[1:29:50] back up to an hour you know and then
[1:29:52] somebody else they come in 45 minutes
[1:29:54] late that means I gotta go 45 minutes
[1:29:56] long okay

[1:30:05] y'all know I love you right what's up
[1:30:09] I do love you I say things to make you
[1:30:12] smile sometimes
[1:30:14] listen but you and I must understand
[1:30:16] this this is what first John message
[1:30:22] 11 and 16. owns it says
[1:30:27] okay those of you got your Bibles turned
[1:30:29] to your Bibles and those who got your
[1:30:30] iPhone 30.
[1:30:37] I page
[1:30:43] the 11th verse says
[1:30:45] for this is the met that the message
[1:30:48] because that you heard from the
[1:30:51] beginning
[1:30:54] that we should love one another Cane
[1:31:02] is who was of that Wicked one and slew
[1:31:07] his brother
[1:31:12] because his own Works were evil
[1:31:16] and his brother's righteous
[1:31:20] how many of us have ever heard the
[1:31:24] phrase
[1:31:25] it takes one to know one
[1:31:28] in person
[1:31:33] usually those who pointing fingers
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:38] are are guilty as well
[1:31:41] you see what I'm saying so you and I
[1:31:44] must understand
[1:31:46] all I'm trying to get us to see them
[1:31:51] let me say it like this song
[1:31:55] remember I told you about racism
[1:31:58] right and I explained to you in the
[1:32:02] beginning it was not racism
[1:32:05] it was tribalism
[1:32:07] because people came from different
[1:32:09] tribes
[1:32:11] they began to build walls
[1:32:16] and one tribe thought they were better
[1:32:20] it's only in this modern day
[1:32:23] I think it was um
[1:32:26] Christopher Columbus discovered America
[1:32:28] in what 1849.
[1:32:32] I can't remember 1642.
[1:32:36] 14 1492. that was when that was when uh
[1:32:42] uh it began to get become racial in
[1:32:46] racism in America
[1:32:49] but anyway let me let me get back to
[1:32:52] this
[1:32:55] let me ask you a question
[1:32:57] the Garden of Eden
[1:33:00] where was it located
[1:33:03] it was located in Africa
[1:33:08] is that right that's the voice that's
[1:33:10] the beginning that means that all of us
[1:33:13] are Africans
[1:33:14] Africa there is
[1:33:17] Africa it don't make no difference how
[1:33:19] your color changed Expressions
[1:33:23] because you go all the way back to the
[1:33:26] origin
[1:33:27] and that's where it comes from
[1:33:32] remember in the towel of Bible
[1:33:36] all of us look alike until
[1:33:41] God changed the language
[1:33:43] then after he changed the language there
[1:33:47] was a continental divide yeah and
[1:33:50] individually continue and then it was
[1:33:52] during that time
[1:33:54] those who were in Asia took on the Asian
[1:33:57] look and those numbers
[1:34:00] and those who went up north chains
[1:34:03] God way of changing things
[1:34:10] that's exactly where it is what it is
[1:34:15] a
[1:34:17] Pakistani in this the other day
[1:34:21] I say well where did the original man
[1:34:23] started
[1:34:26] he said in Africa I said didn't we all
[1:34:28] Africans
[1:34:33] y'all so quiet
[1:34:38] it doesn't matter what everybody looks
[1:34:41] like
[1:34:43] we had one Mama
[1:34:45] um
[1:34:52] that's why Bob said one blood in One
[1:34:54] race
[1:34:58] One race Universe you can break it up to
[1:35:01] three I'm sure I'm in Jefferson
[1:35:07] same blood ma'am song oh come on folks
[1:35:12] you gotta understand
[1:35:14] that when we get to heaven
[1:35:18] God is going to have us all kinds and
[1:35:22] colors and all in one big group
[1:35:25] Hallelujah
[1:35:33] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses a
[1:35:35] white man
[1:35:40] Jesus Christ
[1:35:49] there is no such thing as a superior
[1:35:52] race
[1:35:56] damn it
[1:35:57] if there be a superior race it'd be the
[1:35:59] bride
[1:36:03] oh Lord y'all don't like it
[1:36:06] y'all even scared to say Amen remember
[1:36:15] hallelujah look where the world has
[1:36:18] brainwashed us
[1:36:23] and you're really brainwashed if you
[1:36:26] think being black and it's gonna
[1:36:28] separate you because you live in a
[1:36:29] different country
[1:36:38] or whatever color you may be I got off
[1:36:41] on something I need to bit back on my
[1:36:42] thoughts
[1:36:45] but my whole point is I'm trying to
[1:36:47] Bring It Back Into Love let me tell you
[1:36:51] how I know it's possible
[1:36:54] with different tribes
[1:37:00] because there's a Time
[1:37:03] Israel with 12 tribes Israel and they
[1:37:07] loved each other
[1:37:09] they fought with each other
[1:37:12] you understand me when the enemy came in
[1:37:15] the trumpet sounded like trumpets
[1:37:18] Hallelujah one a group of
[1:37:21] eat go out and group the regular drop it
[1:37:23] with sound the ones who under the ax
[1:37:26] would go out there the man y'all
[1:37:29] understand me those Guardian Angels says
[1:37:33] God those those people who protected the
[1:37:36] Ark of the covenants
[1:37:42] when Israel was in Harmony
[1:37:45] and nothing could defeat them uh
[1:38:22] because there's only one human being
[1:38:26] atoma
[1:38:33] let me say this
[1:38:35] when I get up here to sing
[1:38:38] I don't care if you don't accept it
[1:38:41] I like it when you do
[1:38:44] but I ain't singing to you
[1:38:50] understand me I mean if I get up here
[1:38:53] and singing everybody sit down on me
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:25] what are we trying to do
[1:39:37] because he's revealed to himself in me
[1:39:40] and I know it takes more than just
[1:39:43] religions
[1:39:48] Hallelujah
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:23] but everybody that took the warning
[1:40:27] when the storm came they were gone
[1:40:30] they got out of Harm's Way is it is the
[1:40:35] flood coming yeah not just in uh flood
[1:40:39] not just in America
[1:40:42] all over the world
[1:40:45] God's getting ready to shake all
[1:40:47] Christians Jews to prepare a movie and
[1:40:50] if you don't know the Judgment of the
[1:40:52] Lord
[1:40:54] you lose your house foreign
[1:41:33] and uh nine through twelve or nothing
[1:41:36] and then I'm gonna go ahead on with this
[1:41:40] you know why I'm preaching this folks
[1:41:42] some people because you see
[1:41:46] because when Peter got thrown in jail
[1:41:50] Church went into prayer
[1:41:56] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:41:57] yeah when someone in our church is
[1:42:00] Afflicted with anything
[1:42:04] did you know what brother random says
[1:42:08] if a church pray for somebody
[1:42:14] we need to search the campaign
[1:42:19] sin is in the camp
[1:42:22] did y'all know he said that
[1:42:24] there is no reason
[1:42:28] there's no reason why why when we pray
[1:42:32] because God hears us before we pray
[1:42:35] God
[1:42:38] we can't win this
[1:42:43] win the sea
[1:42:45] Hallelujah Aiken gotta go I can't do a
[1:42:49] salt to you he has to repent or get up
[1:42:51] and get out you don't understand me
[1:42:54] you don't what will it be at the
[1:42:57] Judgment
[1:42:58] if you living a wicked life somebody
[1:43:01] don't get Victory because of your life
[1:43:06] foreign
[1:43:10] Hallelujah
[1:43:12] you think God don't know he does know
[1:43:16] I'm not talking about people who are
[1:43:18] trying to overcome
[1:43:20] Hypocrites
[1:43:22] you come here living one way and then go
[1:43:25] out the door and live in another way
[1:43:31] may God help us end he
[1:43:36] he's
[1:44:00] his name is Stanley Barnes is Stanley
[1:44:04] Barnes and we've been friends ever since
[1:44:06] fourth grade
[1:44:09] and he says something to me hey magic
[1:44:12] echo shoes and I said you offended me
[1:44:15] you know what he did he stopped laughing
[1:44:20] he said I can't offend you yeah
[1:44:23] and I started laughing because what he
[1:44:26] said was true and what it was I was
[1:44:29] trying to act like I was offended
[1:44:36] we disagree with them but there's not
[1:44:40] really an offense
[1:44:43] Hallelujah Your Love covers all of that
[1:44:46] but he that hateth his brother
[1:44:50] and walketh
[1:44:57] because that Darkness have blinded his
[1:45:00] eyes
[1:45:02] this is why you can't you can't allowed
[1:45:10] even anger
[1:45:14] do y'all think you're going to have
[1:45:15] anger in heaven
[1:45:18] the kind of anger we experience
[1:45:22] comes from the Fallen nature
[1:45:29] when Jesus was being crucified
[1:45:32] he never got angry
[1:45:35] even when he ran the the the the the
[1:45:38] people out of the temple with the whip
[1:45:44] you understand me he called it righteous
[1:45:47] eat the nation
[1:45:50] in other words he didn't have I'm gonna
[1:45:53] get you back
[1:45:54] I'm gonna kill you
[1:45:59] that wasn't in his mind it was
[1:46:02] chastisements
[1:46:05] oh y'all better pay attention
[1:46:13] I write unto you little children
[1:46:17] because your sins
[1:46:20] are forgiven you
[1:46:23] for his namesake of course this or not
[1:46:26] so he said yeah Adam forgave you Joseph
[1:46:30] how many of y'all think y'all worthy to
[1:46:32] be forgiveness
[1:47:02] on October accounts
[1:47:05] he said and that
[1:47:07] and because that God is God
[1:47:21] and give a fear to him
[1:47:24] and that brings respect
[1:47:28] God has demanded that for himself
[1:47:34] let me tell you like this there are some
[1:47:38] of you who cannot help yes but to come
[1:47:41] late on Sundays but for those of you who
[1:47:43] willfully come late
[1:47:47] you lack respect
[1:47:50] you respect your job more than you
[1:47:53] respect God
[1:47:55] hello
[1:47:57] you lack respect
[1:48:00] your revelation of God is incorrect
[1:48:05] some we can't help it
[1:48:10] I don't like the way the song leadership
[1:48:19] um
[1:48:21] you're wrong
[1:48:23] and God put the song leader here just
[1:48:26] for you hey I mean
[1:48:29] to get to you so you can repent of your
[1:48:32] pride who who fell apart that's what it
[1:48:36] is
[1:48:38] the old Pentecostal Church didn't care
[1:48:40] nothing about how you
[1:48:43] how
[1:48:44] is
[1:48:45] Hollywood we gotta sound Perfect Pitch
[1:48:49] Perfect
[1:48:50] are you insane it's when God said see
[1:48:55] make a job for noise don't defendant and
[1:48:59] we've got so prideful
[1:49:02] we want everybody to know we got the
[1:49:05] best song leader
[1:49:08] foreign
[1:49:34] and I got good ears
[1:49:37] and I'm telling you it was rough
[1:49:40] but you know what I did a song with him
[1:49:46] I enjoyed myself
[1:49:50] and one of the funniest things
[1:49:53] he said to me you might imagine I don't
[1:49:57] know why the people come so late
[1:50:00] they always wait until the song service
[1:50:03] is over if you're interested
[1:50:08] I thought about this church
[1:50:13] God was telling me and telling on you
[1:50:15] Germany

[1:50:37] listen Equity I don't come to church be
[1:50:39] pumped up

[1:50:55] this is not even in my notes and I don't
[1:50:57] remember but I want you to understand I
[1:50:59] don't care

[1:51:35] ain't nobody listening to you anyway
[1:51:44] I'm talking about Turing coming into the
[1:51:47] uh perfect the will of God

[1:52:02] hurry up I know I'm going along there's
[1:52:03] everybody else you see
[1:52:05] and that and because that God is God
[1:52:08] he deserve a respect
[1:52:11] that's right and he we've got to respect
[1:52:15] him and give a fear to him
[1:52:18] and that brings respect
[1:52:21] God has demanded
[1:52:24] that for himself
[1:52:30] did y'all hear that not just for him but
[1:52:33] for all
[1:52:35] God demand respect for his servants
[1:52:39] people see his servants
[1:52:42] how we know that they are his servants
[1:52:46] because he vindicates these servants
[1:52:49] by his words
[1:52:53] let me tell y'all something my brother
[1:52:56] is not even a Christian
[1:53:00] and the other day you remember I told
[1:53:03] you my brother had stage four cancer
[1:53:11] and this cancer literally went into his
[1:53:14] bones
[1:53:15] you text me the other day he is
[1:53:19] completely cancer-free
[1:53:23] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:53:25] you know why he believed in prayer even
[1:53:30] though he's another Christian he called
[1:53:32] me
[1:53:34] my father prays for him
[1:53:37] my sister-in-law pray for him
[1:53:41] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:53:44] but he never gave up
[1:53:47] no matter what the doctors told him
[1:53:51] y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[1:53:54] hallelujah a brother a brother from
[1:53:57] White Horse Hallelujah
[1:54:36] when God tells a man to do something
[1:54:39] it is just good as done he said is
[1:54:44] we pray my wife and I
[1:54:46] my father and then my wife read a quote
[1:54:50] in my family
[1:54:52] the brother brother random that book uh
[1:54:56] praying thoughts or something like that
[1:54:58] he
[1:55:00] healing thoughts
[1:55:02] healing prayers yeah
[1:55:04] um and we read that to him
[1:55:08] he texted me just yesterday
[1:55:11] and he says everything has stopped
[1:55:15] he said I'm eating it is he said that
[1:55:18] that uh uh uh uh all the blood
[1:55:22] everything has stopped I'm eating and
[1:55:24] the doctors say they can't find nothing
[1:55:25] wrong
[1:55:32] but if there is no respect
[1:55:36] you gotta have respect for the Servants
[1:55:39] of God
[1:55:47] if you lay hands on The Sins
[1:55:51] Not Just foreign
[1:56:28] those of us who need Deliverance
[1:56:30] you don't give up now God I keep falling
[1:56:35] to the same old thing
[1:56:38] continuing but if you believe God heard
[1:56:41] your prayers
[1:56:45] put a steak down
[1:56:48] a stake a staff or Metro I asked to be
[1:56:52] delivered stick down God said he would
[1:56:54] deliver me
[1:57:00] let me hurry up I'm sorry
[1:57:05] all right
[1:57:07] we've got to respect him
[1:57:09] and give a feel to him
[1:57:12] and that brings respect
[1:57:15] God has demanded
[1:57:17] that for himself
[1:57:21] God demands respect
[1:57:24] for his servants
[1:57:27] he his servants
[1:57:29] how we know that they are here
[1:57:36] he takes these servants he points
[1:57:39] himself make them Servants of God
[1:57:46] Hallelujah
[1:58:10] did not Jesus say
[1:58:13] in so much as you've done it until the
[1:58:15] least of these
[1:58:16] I know I'm wearing you out a little bit
[1:58:18] but I need you to listen
[1:58:28] was hanged at your neck
[1:58:34] yes
[1:58:37] and you would drown in the depths of the
[1:58:39] sea everyone was on phone sitting on it
[1:58:41] then
[1:58:46] I'm saying this to husbands I'm saying
[1:58:50] this to wives I'm saying this to
[1:58:53] Children yes I was on phone you gotta
[1:58:55] respect one another
[1:58:58] because she's your wife
[1:59:02] God will deal with you
[1:59:06] because he's your
[1:59:09] husbands
[1:59:13] you can't even mistreat your children
[1:59:15] remember
[1:59:17] especially when you've dedicated them
[1:59:19] it's a specific moment when you have
[1:59:21] dedicated your children to the Lord they
[1:59:24] are no longer yours
[1:59:33] I'm closing so it fell there's a lot
[1:59:36] more to say but I'm closing yeah
[1:59:38] remember I told you I was whipping my
[1:59:42] son one day
[1:59:44] and uh he started calling on the name of
[1:59:47] Jesus
[1:59:55] I sounded like a devil
[1:59:59] stop calling on the name
[2:00:04] foreign
[2:00:40] right and some of them kids listening
[2:00:46] [Laughter]
[2:00:50] it works
[2:00:54] but I see it like this
[2:00:56] if that name stopped me
[2:01:01] what about the Unseen I lost
[2:01:07] I'm trying to
[2:01:09] my heart you have no idea
[2:01:13] I think about the church all the time
[2:01:15] yes please there's not a day that goes
[2:01:18] by that I don't think about this church
[2:01:23] Iowa City
[2:01:26] I even can remember that you know when
[2:01:28] it seemed like we were even that church
[2:01:30] was a one Accord with us this church
[2:01:37] but I see now the enemy has wedged a
[2:01:40] little Gap in between
[2:01:45] and that's nonsense yes
[2:01:51] very childish
[2:01:53] but I'll say this by the grace of God
[2:01:57] the only way to correct yourself
[2:02:01] is to get on your knees and pray say the
[2:02:05] moment
[2:02:06] this can't be practice so as I'm
[2:02:09] prepared to practice change comes only
[2:02:11] by the Holy Ghost
[2:02:12] he's the only one that could change your
[2:02:15] heart change your mind and change your
[2:02:18] ways Hallelujah
[2:02:22] how many times you've heard a lot of
[2:02:24] preaching for metaphors
[2:02:30] heard about everything the word being
[2:02:33] open and yeah
[2:02:38] go ahead there you go to convince you
[2:02:40] that brother Branham is the prophet of
[2:02:41] the year
[2:02:51] it's you
[2:02:54] because Israel understood Moses to be a
[2:02:58] prophet Israel company
[2:03:03] they ate Manna From Heaven
[2:03:06] they draw great water from the rock the
[2:03:09] zombies God fed him quail
[2:03:16] and you know what they never crossed
[2:03:19] over you know why because they were
[2:03:23] murmurous and complaints
[2:03:26] and as long as you murmur can't complain
[2:03:29] possible
[2:03:37] I'm just telling you
[2:03:42] James put it this way
[2:03:44] James had me if you can't control this
[2:03:48] she won't put me back he said your
[2:03:50] religion is in vain
[2:03:54] said the same thing
[2:03:56] everything comes out of his mouth
[2:04:00] will either glorify God's glorified
[2:04:06] you love the Lord remember will you send
[2:04:08] you oh we got to mature
[2:04:10] we got to get all things give thanks
[2:04:13] don't you choose don't need
[2:04:15] um
[2:04:16] stand please I remember the time
[2:04:20] I was outside
[2:04:23] uh I think I was doing some yard work
[2:04:28] but anyway I I I wasn't watching where I
[2:04:32] was going and I stumped my toes
[2:04:37] did that hurt
[2:04:39] but I in stumping my toe you know I went
[2:04:45] down just far enough
[2:04:47] to miss the tree live
[2:04:51] if I had not stopped my throat
[2:04:54] I would I would have really put a real a
[2:04:57] knot on my head
[2:05:00] and you know what
[2:05:02] I thank God for it John now she dribble
[2:05:05] sir
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:09] I thank God for everything that's that
[2:05:11] has taken place in my life the good job
[2:05:19] and yes there were times that yeah yeah
[2:05:22] my life was over overflowed
[2:05:26] with with pain and hurt and songs
[2:05:30] [Music]
[2:05:33] in about three months years ago three
[2:05:35] months
[2:05:37] I lost three sisters
[2:05:42] and they were all my favorite okay
[2:05:45] they loved me they respected my belief
[2:05:50] they love my wife they treated me really
[2:05:54] good
[2:05:55] and I had no idea
[2:06:00] and I was about to lose my mind I
[2:06:02] thought because
[2:06:05] I I I would get in my car
[2:06:09] I would drive and cry hysterically
[2:06:14] because as a Christian
[2:06:17] I didn't understand how God took those
[2:06:20] people away from
[2:06:22] meant so much
[2:06:29] majority of my family rejected me my
[2:06:32] Village I'm the only one in the message
[2:06:34] in my family
[2:06:36] so the only family I have is you foreign
[2:06:41] [Music]
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:46] [Music]
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:08:00] [Music]
[2:08:01] it because I was led to preach it he
[2:08:03] says
[2:08:06] sometimes it's those kind of lessons
[2:08:08] that makes us remember our first results
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:12] but you came up anyway man was that
[2:08:15] coming yeah I really appreciate
[2:08:17] everybody that showed up and those who
[2:08:19] could not because
[2:08:24] we appreciate you as well
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:37] think about it this little church in
[2:08:40] Iowa
[2:08:42] we could please God so much
[2:08:47] you will have Angel visitations
[2:08:51] that's what I look at that's what I look
[2:08:54] for
[2:08:55] but I can't do it on my own
[2:08:58] man that's why I go out and say what I
[2:09:01] say
[2:09:02] judgment begins at the house of God
[2:09:06] I can preach positive things I do
[2:09:11] but I'm concerned about this
[2:09:14] more than anything else
[2:09:22] because I know if the Heart Is Right
[2:09:26] the spirit in this church will change
[2:09:30] but you know when I come to church
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:47] when I'm in my office I don't have a
[2:09:49] battle concentration but when I come in
[2:09:52] here you see like I say get you a cup of
[2:09:56] coffee
[2:09:58] whatever it takes to get you into a a a
[2:10:02] uh
[2:10:04] awaken you
[2:10:05] he deserves it
[2:10:08] the Lord Jesus deserves your prayers may
[2:10:12] your praise excuse me he
[2:10:16] deserve your reverence
[2:10:18] don't don't come to church in Short
[2:10:20] change him
[2:10:23] you understand me most of us don't come
[2:10:26] to church but once a week
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:30] I'm still can't comprehend how you do it
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:37] and I just say it by God's grace if you
[2:10:40] just gonna come once
[2:10:43] everything you got into it
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:58] [Music]
[2:10:59] you should have anointing in this place
[2:11:02] that would knock me off my feet
[2:11:06] knock me off my feet
[2:11:10] really if you come to church
[2:11:16] thinking that it was boring you need the
[2:11:20] Holy Ghost
[2:11:22] you need a stirring up or something
[2:11:25] wrong in your spirit
[2:11:29] when the word is being preached
[2:11:34] screaming even though I do it sometimes
[2:11:36] that's not it
[2:11:43] and his words were never raised like
[2:11:45] John the Baptist
[2:11:48] but his word had life
[2:11:52] in my in closing okay what has all the
[2:11:57] emotional Services done for you kisses
[2:12:00] if you've been in a service and you
[2:12:03] jumping and dancing
[2:12:05] I would love to see that here yeah
[2:12:08] after it's all done
[2:12:11] because
[2:12:15] we come here for change
[2:12:20] we can't pretend that everything is all
[2:12:22] right when we can see this
