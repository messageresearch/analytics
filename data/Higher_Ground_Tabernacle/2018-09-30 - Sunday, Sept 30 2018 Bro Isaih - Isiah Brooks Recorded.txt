TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we turn to Matthew four and four they're gonna read Matthew four and then we'll go to John first job excuse me first John three eight through ten Matthew the fourth chapter then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hundred and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone jesus said unto Him it is written again thou shall not tempt the LORD thy God again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things will I give thee if thou would fall down and worship Me then said Jesus unto Him get the hint Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord that God and him only shalt thou serve one more scripture first John 3 8 through 10 for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil first John 3rd chapter 8 through 10 whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother let us pray do you have any father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything that you have done to and for us forgive us of our sins strengthen us today Lord that will be a true example of your word help us all Lord in this trying and testing our but father not I will let thine be done in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I'd like to entitle this message this morning it must be perfect it must be perfect when we think about perfection we think about something that is entirely without flaw or defects or shortcomings like a perfect Apple or a perfect orange or something that has done so well that you can't find a way to undo it like a perfect crime brother branham tells us that one of the great ways of one of the greatest robberies ever done in the history of mankind was done by way of false light and I want you to know this evening that's exactly what happened in the Garden of Eden the spirit of the Antichrist move and that Antichrist came in on the white horse rider even then he came with a true teaching and that teaching was to take Adam and his wife off of the word because he worked with their reasoning it became so write that deed and then that deed was conceived and it became a doctrine and II took that same doctrine to her husband that doctrine not only grew but it multiplied and it produced what we would say a church that deed came to a place where it got onto a red horse rider and it rode and it brought church bloodshed and persecution even death to Abel didn't stop there because now the church grew it became a mega church and the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair death is now riding restrictions and things women became beautiful hello just like in this day and that deed became a doctorate in that church began to rule so that Bible said violence increased in the land God heard their voice and that horse is now still riding but that horse brought them to a horrible death the Bible says in Genesis 6 I believe that God repented that he made mankind because they were so evil that horse had conquered that spirit Antichrist had conquered so much of the church because remember now Adam and Eve was the first church here on earth Satan came in and defiled the church by way of the serpent and that spirit kept riding and riding till they brought the people of God to a horrible judgment remember God warned them because amen before God will judge you and sentence you he warns you before judgment and through the voice of Noah he warned them but they did not take heed in the midst of all of this we had a mighty man by the name of Enoch and the Bible said that he walked with God man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and therefore Enoch out of all the people in the world understood it was safer to walk with God than with men and understand he had to be isolated he was the only one that meant God's criteria he was perfect because he followed every word of God it doesn't mean that he didn't make mistakes because you know and I know that our perfection is not of us but it is of God and as long as we follow the message of the Word of God and do the best we can the blood of Jesus Christ keeps us covered that is what makes us perfect that's why I'm saying tonight or this morning whatever you do stay under the blood out of that a great church only eight souls were saved you don't take the Antichrist period back for granite is already conquer the world is that right it conquered a world through deception and there was nowhere in the land and the only profit was there was anak and evidently nobody listened to him even though he built the pyramid his gospel there do you find nobody under his ministry nobody listened but then you find Noah he couldn't get anybody either outside of his house and it had to be a hard time forward it had to be a tough time ain't meant for Noah to keep his family in line with all of the wickedness and stuff that was going on just like it is now People of God you don't have to tell me it is very difficult family fathers mothers to keep your children underneath this message what do they say you too strict you're too controlling but let me tell you something someone will control you it's going to either be the Holy Spirit or it's going to be the devil it's going to be Christ or it's going to be the Antichrist you're not going to get out of this situation without a sentence hello it must be perfect how can we serve God in such a perfect way I'll tell you how coming from the statue of a perfect man he says a body has now prepared me God dwells in the statue of a man reflecting himself into that being being perfect worship God in us hello that's God in us that's what perfect worship is being his tabernacle manifesting oh how we could stay on that till you would almost suffocate see God has always at all time reflected himself in a man God is not interested in religion because even the Antichrist produced our religion you say he didn't yes she did that spirit produced a man-made religion right in the Garden of Eden when it became a doctrine one thing they did know in that day they were naked in this day the religion has covered them and blinded them so much they don't even know they're naked but in that day they covered themselves with fig leaves that was their religion and they literally thought that God was going to accept their religion God did not accept Cain's offering and God will not accept yours either accept your offering be made by the blood of the Lamb hello it must be perfect and that perfection only comes by God's Word it's not him who will it no he that run it but God that shows mercy come on somebody in this day religion will make your wife turn and look at Sodom that's the Antichrist spirit so brethren when you get up when you see your wife turning understand it is the Antichrist spirit of this age that got her turning and looking at Sodom oh she wants to be so beautiful she wants to be so accepted she wants she wants the things of Sodom understand you know wrestle against flesh and blood your arousal against spiritual wickedness in high places it's in the Bible every spirit we're dealing with right now has already been is that songs of Solomon true I feel like shouting this morning the songs of Solomon says everything that have been you see now has already been that means somebody had to deal with the same spirit you and I are dealing with but there's only one way of escape that's under the blood of Jesus Christ and listen you and I must understand there is no excuse God for every believer has truly placed a seed in you you can't even love God if the seed of God is not in you that seed must be in you this is why I struggled in I struggled with the message not the message but the people I've struggled so much I know I'm faulty but I know the seed is perfect and I know that I have always had in all my Airy ways I have always had a perfect desire to serve God perfectly I've always pressed I've always tried but it confuses me when I see people with no efforts they don't care about pleasing God and they don't even care about pleasing you the only thing they care about is pleasing themselves but the Bible said here is that manifestation Invista children of God are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother that means do it that means continue to do wrong no you're doing wrong and there is no repentance hmm I want you to understand you can be seen and still backslide and if you do backslide then God will deal with you brother madam said if he can't get a true seed to repent he spanks them and put them to sleep we call that death you know I've had people say well you know I've been taken under the blood and then nothing happened to me that ain't nothing to brag on because the Lord chasing those whom he loved if God don't chase in you then perhaps you're not he is but if God chasing you and bring you back to God y'all know what I'm saying some of us have backslidden without even the church knowing but God because He loves you he thank you and brings you back it must be perfect reading from Isaiah 64 4 through 7 want you to know that the power of completion is in the seed it's not about you in other words it's not him that will it know he that running on but it's God who shows mercy you understand me because God will not lose one those who are of his Amen he will go whatever measure whatever distance he must go to save you he will do so MA because God is incomplete without one of us did you hear me he is incomplete without one of us God is a God that if he had a hundred sheep he'll never be satisfied with ninety-nine because the Bible said he'll leave the ninety-nine and go find the other one by the mighty God we serve for since the beginning of the world men have not heard not perceived by the ear neither have the eyes seen Oh God besides thee what he had before him that waiteth for him they all needed him that rejoices and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in the way in the what thy ways behold thou art Roth for we have sinned and in those continents excuse me and we have we shall be saved continuous and we shall be saved but we are all as unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken his us away and there is none that call it upon thy name that stirred up himself to take hold of thee but thou has hid that face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities but now O Lord thou art our Father we are the clay thou are our Potter and we are all the work of thy hand is that all right we're in the Book of Jeremiah he said I went down to the potter's house and there I caused e to hear my word hello see none of us cried out but God start working on you to the point you cried out to him so you can't boast and brag oh I called it a lot no God had to work on you first in order for you to cry out to him it must be perfect not one of us will be able to stand before the throne of God and tell God I did this and I did that hello remember every one of them that stood before the throne of God says Lord haven't I done many works in that name haven't I cast out Devils every one of them that stood in the presence of a God of God who said that God said what you workers of iniquity I did not even know you why because you know and I know those who truly have met Christ will be able to say the Lord it's not me it's not that I live but it's Christ that lives in me it's not that I've done a great thing oh lord have mercy people let me tell you even the saints of God when the seals were opened and those 24 elders stood there with their crowns on hallelujah amen the first thing they did when Jesus when they came into the presence of Jesus amen what did they do that through the crowd love and they hit the floor because they realize they realized that their they were unworthy none of us are worthy of ourselves to be in heaven or even in the heavenly places it is the grace of God God didn't leave yourself salvation in your hands salvation is of the Lord says the word he didn't leave it in your hair because we're failures to begin with like the prophets said we mess up everything it's very difficult it meant for us to walk a straight line without the Holy Spirit and even then we crickets sometime hello arise and go down to the part and there will I cause need to hear my words then I went down to the potter's house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and I think that's what's happening now we're on the wheels some of us are on the wheels hallelujah a lot of time we feel like our challenges are gonna overtake us they can't when God as our brother said is producing a testimony huh every trial and test you go through hallelujah is building a testimony for Jesus don't give up on God as you heard me saying because he won't give up on you hallelujah so you and I must know by the grace of God these trials will pass everything that's not permanent will pass Oh Lord I don't know about you but when I go through my tests I must trust him I have nothing else to trust I must trust him he's the Shepherd I'm the Sheep wherever he leads me I'll follow and I went down to the potter's house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels you know a lot of time we want to get off the wheels but you know what a wheel is it's a sign of eternity only the pottery that gets on those wheels have a hope of eternity come o Suvari I'm talking about God's will when you get on his wheel I forgot what that's the holiday the Jewish people are now celebrating and and one of the things that they celebrate is what they do is they they put the platform wherever the preacher is and they go around in circles oh they just enjoy themselves what and you know why they go out in circles because they say it's the end of the seventh day and now we're entering the eighth day it is a sign of eternity hallelujah and you and I must understand Amen that when God puts you on the wheel he's working you any of the oh dear it get broken did y'all know that when God Amen puts you on the wheel a lot of times we think that it's the end of it all if I could just get off the wheel but you don't understand when you get off the wheel you got another phase the fire you've got to go through the fire and if you don't make it through the fire it means that there is something still unclean in the clay something that makes the Pape pottery break when it's under fire hello and then when you break guess what God do he don't throw you away he takes those broken pieces again and start the work all over again that's your Potter and that's my Potter right now that's just a phase because a lot of us think that oh my god hi I'm gonna make it let me tell you something the great squeeze haven't even come yet God's trying to condition your mind to the place where you trust him he wants you to trust him because he knows if you trust him when the squeeze do come you'll make it through you'll make it through but if you don't trust him now how you gonna trust him later it must be perfect oh I just feel like shouting right now I feel the president the Lord I don't know whether you do or not but on the whole still I might do it after I'm finished but I want you to understand it meant that God amen has a word for you and I this is not a sermon that brother Brooks just caught up god is personally delivering you a message the message that brother Branham preached wasn't just something to tickle your ear he he was delivering from God a message to the bride and here I stand in his stead not just me every preacher that's preaching this message is hearing from God and we're connected right now and God is saying to you it must be perfect but the only way it can be perfect you must be found under the blood see the nature of the seed and thank God for the seed I don't want to be one that shouts and jump and run up and down the aisle and I can't live it what good is that huh what good is that but the point is is that if you are understand the leadership of the Holy Spirit will lead you to your burden is that right hallelujah God will make sure you come to a real birth if you don't allow him to lead you he will drive you and that's what the squeeze is really about driving us because we're too lazy and dolet or we've got too many things going on like I said Wednesday we too busy burden under Satan's yoke don't have time to pray don't have time to witness don't have time to read your Bible don't even have time to listen to brother Branham without falling asleep hallelujah we don't grow when things are easy we grow when we faces challenges hmm that's when you facing a challenge that's when you realize how much faith muscles you have hallelujah Israel who was supposed to be that's the Church of God when Goliath came on the scene they ran but he was a young boy who had testimony after testimony God had taught him to trust him that's why Saul says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want see baby learn that God was able to bring him out of every situation and circumstance as long as David kept his worship perfect hallelujah and he kept his worship perfect y'all I just love David because David was a man who was able to repent David was a landing man who was able to say Lord I'm sorry David was able to call it like it says Lord I'm in a horrible pit I'm in a deep pit I mean I'm in a terrible place in my spiritual life and I don't know how to get out of it but David said the Lord heard my cry and he lifted me up and he praised me on a rock hallelujah that's what we're all about God wants his children to that right brother Brown said God loves or his children to cry out to him don't be lazy in the cry cry out see love for God is obedience and love for God is holiness to love God and to love man is to be conformed to the image of Christ and this is salvation now hear me this is salvation allowing God to form you into the image somebody dropped those who the notes on me and I thought they were pretty nice I include them in my message because that's it that's it if we're gonna have perfect love we must think like God we must act like God we must walk like God if God said do this we do it if God said do that we do it it is not up to us to question or reason because I'm gonna tell you something as soon as you do that you are now opening yourself up to the Antichrist now that's what he did she opened herself up to reasoning but if you trust God hello if you trust God he will deliver anybody you know in the Bible that ever trust God and he let him down you won't find one example of God Allah any of his believers down like they say he may not come when you want him but he always there on time hallelujah you got a job situation God will never give you a job if you wavering like a a man with a double mind hello if you have I don't care how rough your job gets let me tell you something God can give you a better job if you really want it God owns everything you know one time I hadn't told this many times but it's time for me to say this it's not in my notes but there was a time I had had missionaries for a long time years and I felt like I needed a job I said God I need a dog and we said God said go go fine you want choose the place you want to work Yahoo God is my witness and the Lord told me what to wear when to go and everything I showed up at this hotel which one it was one of my wife a bear witness was one of the best jobs I ever had being a minister gave me time off when I wanted to anytime I could travel or whatever the case may be but not only that they paid me well and uh I wrote wor what God told me to wear you know I went in there and I filled out the application and that that owner came to me the manager whatever said well I am so sorry we just don't have a position for you but if we have anything I'm open we'll let you know [Music] no I didn't leave that unhappy I left there with an assurance because God told me and I asked God for that place to worship work the neighborhood what it was I liked it before I got home that man had already called my wife and told him told her to have him come back we already got a job for him and when I got back to the place the man said we really don't have a job opening but I made one for you hallelujah he said I made one for you and what impressed me was the way you dressed because you was uh you you dressed in a way that you was sure of yourself blessed that man today wherever he is if he's living Lord because he was the one who even he was spiritual enough when I when I got ready to come to Lima I had just received my own hotel to be the general manager I've had my own office and everything else this same man said to me Brooks he called me Brooks he said Brooks because I told him about the offer I had in Lima being a pastor he said Brooks he said I'm not telling you what to do but I'll tell you this he said being general manager of the hotel is gonna be a little difficult for you especially he's because you love God and you he's your first love he said so I tell you what I would do I would take that job I would take that position up then in Lima Ohio now God speaking through a seller and I said yes Lord but heaven yes Lord and some people think all when brother Brooks went to Lima Ohio he was a millionaire y'all and heard all them lies my wife and I i'ma tell you I'll tell you there for a long time me and my wife was getting $500 a month in tithing four years then it increased to a thousand you said all but you have missionaries they are the poorest tight pants in the church most of the time the most money the more money they make the most injure they don't have a revelation of God but anyway I didn't mean to go there I wanted to I wanted everybody to know I was not a millionaire when I was in Lima and some people think I'm a millionaire now but that is a lie from the devil anyway trials will not come to destroy you but we'll let you depend more on God his word must be perfect you must believe that his word is perfect there is no failure in God hallelujah but the only way that will make this word work his faith and did you know that brother Branham said it like this he said you cannot have faith if you don't have love love is the thing that works faith faith works love love works faith because they're twins hallelujah I'm ready to shout here to this morning now you and I must know there is he this is what the prophecy said he says there's many times I fail to pray the prayer of faith there's many times I've tried hard I failed to do it because my faith would not need it huh sometime try your faith just don't meet it because it doesn't meet means it's not time for God to deliver but time for you to be delivered God gives you the faith is that right faint is a gift from God hello faith is a gift from God that doesn't change oh because it doesn't work for you that time well God's Word ain't true what that doesn't change God's Word that doesn't change the Word of God a bit if I pray for 10 thousand people today and ten thousand died in the morning or tomorrow night I'll be there praying for the sick just the same because God's Word says so that's what a real believer is when God says no to you you still says amen tell him me now I'm tomorrow this evening I'll probably deal with blowing the horse-riders because I believe God want me to but I want you to understand that kind of spirit is still reigning among us whenever you let the devil take you off the Word of God by your own reasoning that's the Antichrist I don't care what it is what you're doing that is the Antichrist you are listening to it's not God is that itself remember I said that whatever it said whatever exalt itself above the Word of God and that itself is a person that's saying it self is the one who talked to Eve he became a here he says we must love before we can have faith when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the battlefield for God oh I love God and you want to quit on him love don't quit of conquers all is that right that's the word love never gives up love amen call those things that be not as though they were when there is no sign of victory love say here I stand and the Bible said when you've done all to do to stand stand there for oh I'm not gonna be too much longer but I want you to realize Amen that what you working with it's something that you better how could I say it I want to say to use the word better it would be wise for us to refocus ourselves the way we have handled the word the way we do things and expect oh my listen well you realize it or not the prophet of God said everything we do right now is being recorded your thoughts your actions the clothes you wear everything is being recorded right now why we we saw I don't see God he says even God is here if he here he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the mist he is here he is just a dimensional way but you think God don't see everything you say everything you're thinking what your heart desires are he will and he does you say all what I mean those angels went up before him it says law have you seen what's going on down there in Babylon he said I've been watching it all alone oh they getting ready to throw your sons in the fiery furnace one angel says Lord can I go down wormwood said if I go down Lord I'll turn the world upside down hallelujah but God says huh-uh this is mine the battle is the Lord's hallelujah this is mine and because they trust in him they caught listen they didn't worry about the fire they didn't worry about those who could throw it throw them in then we're not afraid ha because perfect love casts out fear hallelujah and when you are in a position or you are in a trial or you are in a test and you overwhelmed by fear that means you're like in love love for who God you don't trust him like you out too but when trials come and temptations come and you can't see your way that's when you leap that's when you jump hallelujah as long as you can hear his voice you do not need to have the light because his voice is the light hallelujah and that's what what we fail to do God says job I'm right here and you afraid don't be afraid for the leap God's got it all under control sometimes he want to take you there hallelujah is that okay oh it's the truth a lot of times we fail to see that God pushes us into a place where we have to determine whether we gonna love this individual or I hate him hello you think it's by coincidence that God puts you in a position that you have an enemy or two y'all hear me a lot of times people raise up against you on your job and you don't even know why they raising up against you because God ordained it hallelujah and when God ordains it you need to shout whoo hallelujah bah cuz you know God's working with me I'm coming out with a testimony ha y'all better hear me your enemy is God's enemy hallelujah and if they can't prevail over God that means they can't prevail over you like I said last week Amen I said when your boss man said we gonna fire you you need to ask him did God tell you that God gave me this job and if you follow me you gonna have to deal with God because God gave me this job if he's got any soul if he's got any fear of God he'll back it up y'all better put God in your picture let them know I know God you might not like me because I know God but I'm gonna tell you now God gave me this job and if he did not tell you to fire me God is going to deal with you you say a Christian shouldn't be that way yes sir you the authority of this world what you speak hello you should old brother Brooks let me tell you something even when Elijah was in the Roman Orton laws sit down the fire God honored it and I'm not expecting you to be in the wrong announcing but if you want your job you won't know who I'm talking to you want to remain on it put Jesus in the front end in the equation all right see he said of a love even if if a man loves me he'll keep my words right now you can keep his word without having faith in what he said he said you can't keep his word without having faith in what he said right you see if he loves you then he keeps his word is that right if God loves you he's going to keep his word that's in the sinners message desperation hallelujah though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not love it is nothing though I have faith to move mountains and have not love it is nothing see love dominates all Oh God have mercy and I'm talking I love for God if you have love for God that means God have lost you is that the word I love him because of what he first loved me man does not live by bread alone but you must recognize the enemy Judah you know what that means right okay you and I must realize by God's grace amen that God is in control of everything he don't want us fretting oh I'm just so worried my nerves your nerves you saw you're not supposed to be dead a dead man don't have feelings in his nerves I don't think so all systems are shot down and that's what we must understand when God said you must die in wrought that's exactly what he means it's got to be perfect see God can't give you this life he's talking about - this old life is dead and rotted oh so much I want to say but let me go here he said I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world I think the Christians or the message believers have actually forgotten this part be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that means God wants to renew your mind take you off of these dead things dead works works of the flesh and put you in a spiritual atmosphere we all think we having battles here I don't know what all everybody is going through but all over the world people are having tremendous battles and you know what these battles are between husbands and wives and children families are being attacked in every way hallelujah you know there's only seven directions really seven you got seven seals seven days every seven is completion but with God there's eight you say what you got seven positions you could you can have north south east west how do you want to do it but then there's a sinner focus another focus that go takes you this way which II turn is eternity and this is where God is trying to get us out of this y'all y'all hear me let me say it like this fathers and mothers if you don't increase your prayer life Satan will come in to destroy all that you have built oh you can't you can't listen God put us in laodicea leaders here is a condition and this condition is not only found in America it's found everywhere and that same condition is now striking your families and you're not praying you're not crying out before God to help right you better understand God trying to get you to pray is that right God is trying to get you to pray even with my own God is awakening me into prayer he's brought me into a position I've not been in in a long time and you said well what do you mean brother Brooks God did it not just for me but for all you know what let me say it like this we're not where we should be when Peter and James and John was thrown into prison the whole church came together and they prayed for that one individual and God delivered them how many have come together to pray for each keine well you stand there and judge my judgment but you've not prayed about it y'all hear me nobody who's going to the rescue only a few and I appreciate every every one of your efforts you understand me but when a wounded soldier goes down we don't kick them down and we don't leave them down we don't desert it listen we're like Abraham we don't leave one man behind consider this to be yours and what you would want the people to do for you you understand me not just her that we've had others but it's a wake of me that I may be it was too passive when I saw others leave and not return but not again it is the same it is an embarrassment for a shepherd to lose a sheep to the wolf you understand me so you and I must understand i'ma have to stop this but I finish up this evening my thought is until we desire to worship God perfectly you understand me with the virtues of God flowing through us we just play in Christianity mmm and understand that these virtues are not just dropped in your lap these virtues come by way of trial and test is that right each one of these virtues are victories that God has won in your life and every one of those virtues are attainable you can possess them because the Word of God says you can and that is the meat for the bride today this is what we live for to come to that perfect statue of Christ where we will be in a position of translation we'll be in a position of a complete adoption that's what we're talking about and you and I we've been grumbling and complaining and many looking at God as if he made a mistake God didn't make no mistake you made a mistake when you asked God to save you because he believed you and he's gonna do just what you asked him to do but think about it because you tried in the fire you come out like pure gold let go and let God stop let Satan make you frustrated one of the things that I find that if we would pray more if we would pray like we gossip we can get some things done it's a truth it's a truth you know we make the telephone occurs the telephone is not occurs we make it occurs because what we do on it and you and I must realize that God is looking for divine love folks I want you to think about think about this if we're one in a million how many million people God is over path passed over to get to you think about it and you and I are will be more responsible it would be better if we had not heard this message and then then to treat it or trot upon it like it's of no value may God have mercy on us and I want to say this in closing because I want to deal more with the Antichrist this evening it's real it's among us a lot of thing the men that we even see in this message is being influenced by the Antichrist spirit hello and I'm gonna take you by God's grace through the scripture somewhat amen so you can give an idea that in order to be to see it you must be spiritual you must be spiritual because just like the Antichrist spirit produces and give a product right just like I meant to say like this just like Christ when Christ comes in you there is a change when the Antichrist spirit is influencing you there is a change and you're gonna give birth to something right you said well what do you mean let me say it like this in closing I am closing those Jews did not even know they had the Antichrist spirit until the time of the birth they thought that they were all right with your home but at the end of the day they persecuted the truth when the time came I was thinking about that think about this when you cry out crucify him what kind of Devil coulda known any Christian person supposedly the crowd with the worst death ever I'd rather for somebody to cut my head off saw me asunder but to crucify me a slow death like that and those Jews were a way of what a crucifixion was and yet they were so anointed and hated the word so much didn't just say kill him they said Cruz I want you to go home and think about that what what they asked Pilate now to do how can people who believe in Jehovah cry out such a hatred and that same devil works among us in our rings but they can't get loose like they want to because of laws but when you hear of ministry defaming another ministry or or doing some of the things that people do you know it's not Christ somewhere the devil is in there somewhere get him back to this a true minister of God he's not looking for fame he's not looking for fortune and he's not he doesn't care about popularity remember Antipas like I said the other day and I found out what Antipas mean it's basically another word for hate the Pope and here this man hate the Papa anyway this man had such a record with God Paul never spoken none of the Apostles ever spoke of him but Jesus did who nobody who withstood the Antichrist in his day may the Lord help me be an Antipas somebody who will withstand hallelujah love the Lord let's say it mean to be so long but I want you to get it this is not a game I had a thing happened to me just think it was yesterday and I forgot what I was talking to this fella about and from nowhere he says you know what he said it's almost the end like wow this man who appears to be a sinner knows it's almost the end and I thought Lord you're so faithful to me in to us we don't deserve your loving-kindness but I thank you for it anyway let's just bound a word of Prayer dear Jesus we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness and though there are those who sometimes think they're smarter than the pastor I pray father God that you would open their eyes and understanding of what's going on help us bear Jesus that we may see what you see hear what you hear know what you know give us grace to follow you Lord Jesus with all of our heart no matter what the circumstances father for those who are lukewarm those who are not caring have lost their love not just for you but for your people help us Lord give us grace to return if you have to put us back on the potter's wheel so be it so let it be Lord load us and make us into what you would have us to be and that is your image Lord even as your prophet of God told us we're like dirty rags turn into a beautiful paper where the image of your dear son can be printed on help us dear Jesus it is true we are like dirty rags send us through that process that at the end of this process your image will be reflected Lord we love you this morning we of your people we pray father that your perfect will be done in our lives and forgive those Lord who have those indifference feelings about in toward your servant have mercy upon them God we love you and I know they love you as well but we're dealing with
