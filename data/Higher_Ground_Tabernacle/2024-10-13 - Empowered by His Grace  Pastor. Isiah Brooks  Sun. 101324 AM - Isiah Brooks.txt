lower key I drank that coffee and that always restrict my voice as we stand let us turn to St John 6th chapter 37 through3 [Music] 9 and before we get into the scripture I just want to say I don't want nobody on their cell phones looking at games or whatnot not in this place let's respect the Holy Ghost no games no texting that kind of thing if you are have a a a job that you need need that when that comes on your phone walk out then you can answer it in the vest let's keep this place reverent St John 6 37-39 all that the father hath given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out [Music] for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which he have sent me that all which he have given me I shall lose nothing but shall rise in up again at the last [Music] day I'm going to read a quote coming from the Lamb's Book of Life 19566 03 paragraph 104 for the gospel is delivered it's good news and this morning the Holy Spirit through the through the word is bringing you the good news that from the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life all the Devils out of hell can erase it out there God's word has done spoke it just as sure to happen as God wrote it in there before the foundation of the world Amen how glorious our heavenly father is in his infinite love and his Mercy think about it to do that for for us amenu am said be ye per therefore perfect even as your father your your heavenly father is perfect how can you be when there not any Perfection when how can it be when it's not my perfection is not your Perfection it's his Perfection of his word that he chose you and you never chose him he brought you into Christ I want you to hear that he brought you into Christ you just didn't get there he brought you into Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah and you are secured with Jesus Christ and just as perfect as Christ was before God for you're not standing with your own you're standing with in him with one thing I believe God amen amen oh I love him oh my let's repeat that I believe God say it again I believe God now say it like you mean it I believe God Amen let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy thank you for being so good to us what amazing this grace is and we love you we thank you for for all that you do and all that you will do in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I would uh like to entitle this message empowered by his grace the one thing I love about this message it gives every individual a reflection of themselves uh when you look into the word you you're going to see yourself as a Believer or nonbeliever or just a sinner or a make believer however the word strikes Your Heart by way of Revelation that is who you are you understand me I have heard in Prior times how this brother was witnessing to another brother and he gave the brother one of brother bram's messages and this one brother said I don't like that kind of pre preaching he called me a buzzard and then that brother responded it's amazing when I heard the message he called me an eagle see it's your perception of this message will determine what you do if you know this message has been ordained by you excuse me ordained for you you will do your best to walk thereby you understand what I'm saying and I hope this morning the Lord will give us Grace to see that every chain everything that has you have you in bondage those chains have been broken over 2,000 years ago but as long as you don't know that Satan has a right to keep you in bondage his grace is what empowers me it gives me the strength to go on it gives me that that inner uh uh confidence and strength to never think about quitting it gives me a stand alone power that if my mother don't go if my sister don't go if my brother don't go any real it doesn't matter I'm going all the way to see him it's amazing how we spend so many of our years in this message can I say it like this dying for approval appr you know we want somebody to accept us but I'm here to tell you everybody's not going to accept you matter of fact God has ordained people in this church to reject you God put them here for that to see how you would react understand me good and evil all things works together for the good of them that love the Lord those who are the call you understand me those who are the call you understand every many are called but few are chosen but in this message there is De call individuals who know they have been called by God to live this and when you have that understanding of that Revelation Nothing Stops you from going forward we have this religious thing that we want to be accepted religiously but if you've looked around most of the people here don't care about what about your religion Hallelujah now the thing about it is religion is a covering it's not salvation and some of us we we know how to place a facade you know uh uh wanting everybody to as I go back to the to acceptance but we're not here to be approved by each other we're only here to be approved by God sometimes we do things Works which are good works but whenever you do works in the church to impress someone your works are in vain hallelujah hallelujah we work in the church as servants unto the Lord hallelujah I had a son I still have a son he's a grown man now but he and his uh uh uh buddy used to get up and do a a a Duo a du and one day he came to me and said Daddy you know I believe I sound better than so and so when we sing and I told him this you'll not sing again this is not a time of competition and to be honest with you the other guy sound better than he did but you see that's what people do instead of coming to worship God they compete each other y know it's true there's a lot of competition somebody want a better car some want better house some want better clothing God don't care about that what God cares about is a surrendered heart I don't care how fancy your car is I don't care how fancy your your house is we are all sinners saved by grace Hallelujah in this age you must understand Grace Grace is not disgrace Grace is that he's had favor and he's given that favor to you right you don't earn favor favor is something it's a choice in which God made like brother brand said you didn't CH choose him he chose you that's what favor is y'all know how that is if you got sisters and brothers somehow the parents always have a favor or a favor y'all look at me like let's not be Hypocrites y'all know that's true is that biblical absolutely right Joseph was favored Benjamin was favored y'all hear me what I'm saying when Jesus was on Earth John was favored and let me show show you understand God has favored hallelujah hallelujah and you must come to recognize that you are [Applause] favored of God see when you're favored of God you don't have to beg him in prayer all you got to do is him in prayer is that right because he is the supplier of your need oh my God you don't have to work it in order to get anything from God the favorite of God knows the scripture whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it it is yours see that empowers me and as long as you approach god with work trying to earn his favor you won't get it maybe you haven't had a ordeal like this before but being a pastor you always have those people who wants to you to have them as a favor favorite and they just do things for you nothing's wrong with that nothing's wrong with that but my point is what people fail to see that a true Christian favors all Christians all Christians are the favorite of a Christian oh come on somebody it's the truth in let me move on I didn't mean to stay there that long this is the age of adoption this is the bride age this is the age of transformation moving from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the complete statue of Christ Hallelujah to that man that God can adopt understand me and only those who have been chosen by God we'll be able to accomplish it not by their works but by his grace yall understand me because these people chosen before the foundation of the world Hallelujah to be the bride of Christ and y'all must understand with all that brother brandham did with all that he preached he knew and he tried his best to to to make the people see it's about Jesus Christ it's about his word so much so that his whole entire message fell under the theme only [Music] Bel if you only believe all things are possible he's not talking about believing in your head he's talking about a revelation that's in your heart that makes you know what has been spoken [Music] is the truth the grace of God was sent to this generation and only the favor favorite of God or Those whom God favor will have eyes to see it right God gave us in this message and un Covenant right only the true bride of Christ will be able to understand that right it's not only good to hear the word but you and I must come to understand what it means Hallelujah you're you're how can I say moving forward is determined by your revelation of Grace because Grace bring you power Grace makes you stop looking at you it makes you start looking at God hallelujah Grace gives you victory over every enemy what if David would have said Lord you know I haven't been a good Christian I've done my best but should I fast before this giant should I go into an all night prayer see grace gives you identity Grace will reveal to you who you are Hallelujah right it's like it's like when God identified Peter when Peter said to Jesus Thou Art the Christ and then the Christ said Thou Art Peter see that's how the word responds when you say oh my God this message is true it responds yes you a bride hallelujah hallelujah all right coming from the message no let me move on I think I read that already let's go to St John 6 3739 I know some people have gone to a wedding or something I heard that a few people are out sick but I hope by some way they they're listen listening uh uh to this message this morning I haven't gotten where I'm going but I want everybody to see this how are you going to overcome if you don't believe the word if you don't believe the word can do it how you going to overcome and God will take some of the most difficult situations and put it in your life and say speak to this mountain but if you don't believe it see you can speak to it but that mountain won't move it's amazing how the mountain respects Faith you hear what I'm saying because you you believe that the Bible said the whole creation grown amen and waits to see the manifestation of the sons of God God has ordained the creation to be able to recognize a true son and daughter of God hallelujah and when those Sons and Daughters of God speak it doesn't matter what it is it has to obey I I believe it that way St John 6:37 I believe I read it all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out now you your brother I came to the word he said come to me and when he said he's speaking about that he's speaking of the anointing the Holy Ghost the Baptist got the word Methodist had the word however but we talk about the Living Word we talk about the word of the hour if you come to me I will in no wise cast you out the Pharisees had the word some Sadducees had the word but Jesus was the Living Word am hallelujah hallelujah and whether you realize it or not you are writing a script with your life and guess what in that you writing with your life God don't leave nothing out am he didn't leave it out for the Jews and he's not going to leave it out for you right but he said listen and so that's what Grace gives you once receiving the Holy Ghost and this is where I'm working with I'm talking about this doesn't even apply to you until you get the Holy Ghost potentially you're bride but God must VIs Vindicated and he vindicates it by giving you the Holy [Music] Ghost Hallelujah you know that's the truth right that's how you know weat before from tear at the harvest wheat bow their heads but in Harvest the tear stands up pridefully they look alike until it's harvest time that's when the two separate by way of their character hallelujah hallelujah I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me hello somebody we say that when it comes to Jesus Jesus but why did you come what why did you come did you come to live your own life no there's only reason one one reason why you here you were born to manifest the word you were born to glorify God you were born to live for God in this lay the C and age hallelujah hallelujah and this is the Father's will which have sent me that of all which he have given me I I should lose nothing but you rise it up again at the last day Grace gives you a revelation that you are one of them let me say it again cuz some of y'all still struggling you know why you're struggling I won I won't say you you're not Christians but I will say that you're stuck you're stuck in your religion Hallelujah you're trying to approve or get approval when you fail to see that God has already approved you Hallelujah you want God to accept you but you fail to see that you're already accepted let me tell y'all something I love that story on Joseph and I listened to it a little bit this morning it was wonderful Joseph started out you know just in a terrible place as a as a a sheep keeping sheep not much to that but he was ordained for a powerful position in Egypt I believe that and I believe that every True Believer of God of this message we're not we're not Pentecostal we're in The Headstone we're bride we we have a covenant like no one else but you got to believe your vision yall understand me brother Bram didn't come to give you a vision for you not to believe it right oh you say wait a minute wait a minute because Joseph had to believe the dreams that he was receiving he had to believe that what he was seeing came from God Brothers called him crazy but because he believed persecution came and let me tell you like this when you come to a revelation of who you are you can't help but tell somebody and let me say it like this when you start boasting and bragging on Jesus you're going to be persecuted even by your own brothers and sisters the house Hallelujah I'm the only one in my family family that believe this message I had to leave my family because they didn't want to have nothing to do with me you you're insane I got one brother left living and he won't have nothing to do with me but let me put this I don't I'm not looking for sorrow or pity I'm so glad to be able to see I'm so glad that's why I couldn't help but to cry this morning I I I was so full because I see the grace of God for this man and nothing can nobody can take it away it's something God has given me and guess what Grace does it takes away all the fear it takes fear you don't fear man you don't fear the government you don't fear nobody nothing you don't fear demons come on somebody I was at a church not long ago and we were praying for somebody and the brother had an issue and here was a Pastor afraid to pray and that fear was just bouncing off of me and I thought to myself here's a man of God afraid to pray cuz he's afraid of a demon when you are afraid of a demon that means you're lacking the Holy Ghost cuz great is he that's in you come on somebody when brother Brandon was young and that woman was possessed with a devil and how she crawled on her back he ran from her because he didn't fully understand but once that Prophet regrouped Hallelujah once that devil spoke and said we have nothing to do with you will bre that devil exposed himself Hallelujah that little prophet that became that was running from a devil became the Giant Slayer Hallelujah he prayed in faith because he believed what God told him Hallelujah if you get the people to believe no devil will be able to stand before you y'all hear what I'm saying if you believe this message the way you want to will be able to stand before you hallelujah hallelujah glory to God where we fail is to see Jericho walls had to come down it had a time period though walk around seven times y'all hear what I'm saying every promise of God hallelujah has a time period and you got to wait on God and wait for God but you never disbelieve Hallelujah is that right job said I'm going to wait till my change come he wasn't afraid he knew the change was going to come I got to wait but while I'm waiting I'm going to praise God is that all right accepting your grace and accepting your position in Christ you said brother Brooks I don't have the Holy Ghost it ain't God's fault he said repent and be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost somebody help me here so let me say it like this if you ain't got to keep waiting on it but what you need to do is said Lord you promised Hallelujah you promised me now you can't get the Holy Ghost if you didn't bring forth repentance because repentance come first you can be baptized a thousand times in the water but if you don't don't repent you still you go down as a wet sinner or you go down as a dry sinner and you come up as a wet one that's the trth but when you repent you know even the prophet of God said it like this if a person truly truly repent when they baptized God is obligated to give them the Holy Ghost right there hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord see once once acts 238 become a religion to you oh I got to do it to be accepted no no no you won't get nothing and you won't get nowhere you got to come the way they came you got to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Hallelujah I'm here to praise him this morning I'm here to praise him for what he's already done for me hallelujah it's not if I'm going to get to heaven I'm already there it's not if you're going to get there you're already there Hallelujah and what we need to do is get into the grace of God and let the grace of God Empower you give you the strength give you the joy because of the word speaking on your behalf Hallelujah Hallelujah you know what if a man was in jail and he's been there for what 20 years and somebody comes and bail him out Hallelujah when he hear the news it's going to shock him the next question is who is this person hallelujah hallelujah said when you get out of the gate he'll be standing in there you understand me that's how it is with Jesus Hallelujah once like a birdon i y'all know how to listen it's God who set me free it must be God who set you free I was talking to somebody yesterday I said people talking about inheritance demons all of us had them you inherited being a sinner you didn't want to you you came here as a sinner you inherited from Adam and Eve Hallelujah but because I inherited that doesn't mean it has to remain Hallelujah because once you give your life to God I don't care what that inheritance brought through the bird line has to go but it'll never work for you if you don't believe it think you got to work God for it to get it you won't get it if I I I got to give something to make him favor me you are blinded blinded by religious Works Hallelujah the work has already been done Jesus Paid It All y'all hear what I'm saying but your grace is saying you're free I don't care if it's high blood pressure I don't care if it's diabetes I don't care if it's blindness Whatever It Is God is the solution let me ask you a question do you really think when it's time for the rapture we going to be sick and afflicted no brother Bram said he saw it Hallelujah he said limbs will be growing back yall understand me every every Affliction God is going to take care of it has already taken care of it but the bride must reach that Faith level and only way we can reach it we must understand it's not by power it's not by mind but it's by my spirit say the Lord and as long as the devil can keep you believing that you have not been blessed because of your failures you are imprisoned because when are you going to live a holy life a holy enough life for God to accept you impossible imposs now I'm not talking about people going out here living any kind of way doing any kind of way I'm talking about Christians people who are doing their best to live it and to do right those who know they're under the blood of Jesus you a brother Brooks I hadn't gotten to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm working on my sanctification keep on working Hallelujah you keep on working that's God moving you from one place to another he's literally transforming you don't worry about if it's going to be done he promised it will be done he that begun the good work is faithful to complete it hallelujah hallelujah yes this is the time to shout praise God you know John when he saw this the book open the Bible said all Heaven heard me they heard me beneath the Earth they heard me above the Earth everywhere they heard John is the Lamb Hallelujah not worthy is John you'll never be worthy it's Worthy is the Lamb hallelujah hallelujah you got to let this grace you when the devil say you ain't going to make it you tell the devil I'm Li you're a liar I've already made it and by his grace I'm saved not by my works by his grace Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah keep your mind on Jesus as much as you can cu the Bible said you keep your mind sted on him he will grant you peace when you when it seems like you're about ready to lose your mind you need to go hunt for some Jesus y'all hear me amen he's the peacegiver he's the Mind regulator Hallelujah say Lord Jesus let me find something in your word that will bring peace to this storm that I'm going through Hallelujah God is faithful let me say it again God is faithful Hallelujah don't you worry about it the Bible said any man he said he that come to me I will in no wise cast out and the devil will try to tell you if you humble yourselves and go to God he a going to hear you but you're not the first one he told that lie Hallelujah he told the prophet of God you sin Beyond Your Grace Don't Love You No More brother brand said I wouldn't believe him I didn't believe him see what I'm saying you got to shut the devil down when he comes to you with those negative thoughts let Grace Empower [Music] you amen is that right seventh verse no let me go back up here fifth verse even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ Ephesians 2hi by Grace you were saved and half raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I don't have to I don't have to understand it you don't have to understand brother B said when he died we were in him do you remember that no I believe it though when he went to hell I was there you were there when he rose you were there I was there somebody help me here so you got to understand the devil is already defeated and only thing that he can do in is take away your joy really he can't take that you got to give it up Hallelujah amen glory to God I I I I Marvel at job and I always use him when my trials get get intensified I think about it all the time like that get behind me D devil I haven't suffered like job and if job can praise God so can I Hallelujah the Lord give it the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord and though he slay me I'm going to trust him see the devil want us to distrust God hallelujah but no matter what I go through I'm going to trust him no matter what you go through trust the Lord when I was a kid you know how you used to play in the storms the rain right and we had some uh ant uh pile or whatever near this little stream of water saw I wasn't even a I was a kid all of a sudden a leaf fell from the tree moved over there by the ant the ant got on the ant the little bug ant got on the leaf and rode that leaf down the hill you tell me God knew the direction in which that ant wanted to go and furnished him a leaf it was like a it was like a plane trip y'all hear what I'm and as a boy who didn't even know God I was just in awe that that ant had enough sense to get on the Lea and the Lea took Downstream come on somebody do you know how long that would have taken you said that ain't right well what about John Ryan I think it was John Ryan righty the one who had to had to get on on the log he Paul Raider he he had to cut down the tree he was a logger and and his boss told him to take down the tree and take it take it take it down Downstream now he was sick very sick unto death his wife praying for him and while she's praying for him in his dream God is working with him Hallelujah and and the boss said John why are you threating get on that log and ride it down the river Hallelujah you can't carry it some sometime the burdens are too heavy you can't carry it you need to just get on it and ride y understand me and the and brother Bram said God healed the man and he woke up screaming I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I'm riding on it and sometimes that's the way it is you can't fix it we know God can fix it you just got to ride on your problem just get out it and praise God praise him Hallelujah that's what you do and guess what it'll take you right where you need to be Hallelujah I believe that Hallelujah eth verse by grace are you saved through faith amen that not of yourselves I love this it is a gift of God not Works L any man should boast this is what you need to know for we are his workmanship God is working on me he's still working on me I'm not what I ought to be but he's still working on me created in Christ Jesus unto good works you say what do you mean brother B good works are coming right the tree doesn't automatically produce fruit it has to grow to a maturity Hallelujah is that all right and it just can't produce fruit on his own it has to be pollinated by the male tree y'all know that right my wife and I just learned there's differences in watermelons watermelon you got a male watermelon and you got a female watermelon and did you know that the female watermelon is sweeter no I ain't going to tell you I ain't going to tell you that's my secret I tell you after service cuz if I tell you from the PO your mind might not be spiritual enough but anyway the Lord must work on us to Fashion us himself no angel is working on us God is working on us hallelujah hallelujah you must understand he is the master builder you love the Lord give me a few more minutes job 31:15 those of us who are healthy we have no idea how blessed we are when I first moved to Lima excuse me Iowa I would I would run about nine miles a day 4 and a half in the morning and 4 and a half in the evening then as I got got older it it dropped down to about three and a half and now it's at zero but I do walk and I'm grateful that I can walk y understand me as you get older things changes and I said Lord I love running and sometimes I see those fellow running and I basically want to get out that doors and run too but I said Lord I want to keep my knees I don't want no knee replac so you let me know when I run long enough and once you show me that I'll stop running like I used to and he did just that you love the Lord I'm almost done job 31:15 be did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion Us in the womb when some of you have heard me say this before when you in the womb you don't need your hands when you're in the womb you don't need your eyes when you're in the womb you don't need your feet why your mother is your hands your mother is your eyes your mother does everything for you can I say it like that when you in the womb or when you're a new Christian and you you you've just been begotten is that Pastor that brings out the word for you he feeds you to Eagle is that right but you must understand he is feeding you like a mother would feed her baby when when when it's in the womb and she's going to eat healthy and she possibly can because that baby is being prepared for another world you understand me and that's what the pastor must do he's not interested in this world he's interested in the world to come so he gives you the material the food that you need Hallelujah to break into another dimension or Another World right because remember now the bodies that we have now fashioned in our mother's womb was fashioned for this world you understand me so the body that we're to to to obtain the theophany the glorified body is a body from another world you understand me and what we're using here we use things like our mouth and our eyes to touch and to feel you understand what I'm trying to say brother brandom said we'll travel like a thought all you got to do is think about it Hallelujah and understand the supernatural no Dimension will be able to hold us we'll be able to walk from one dimension to another is that the word when Jesus was resurrected he walked through the door hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible said our bodies will be fashioned like him see what I'm trying to get you so understand if you fully understand your grace what God has given to you it will Empower you cuz as long as you think I can't do it you won't do it but you need to come to a place to recognize it's already done I I find it so amazing brother said he's going to prepare a place for us and he said you know what how it's going to be he said God knows everything one each and every one of us like like and he's building this Kingdom based on that you like yeah yall understand me so I Can't Hardly Wait myself let's move on I've got a few more few more scriptures you don't mind and then afterward I'm going to do a little talking okay Isaiah 43 1 2 but now thus say the Lord that created theee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine [Music] amen when thou passest through the waters amen I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when thou walth through the fire Thou shalt not be burned amen neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee amen forget it we oh Lord I ain't worthy to do brother said everybody that came through the a prayer line with that attitude never got healed because the prostitutes already knew they weren't weren't worthy you understand me it was always Christian people call Christians that would literally cheat themselves away from God's healing you say I ain't worthy you tell the devil that's a lie he made me worthy I don't have to work on my worthiness you don't have to work on your worthiness he made you worthy accept your grace because that's the devil he uses that to defeat you every time he can get you to disbelieve something you defeated you defeated because only faith can please God faith has no reasoning faith is and if you don't have faith says Lord give me the faith to destroy this giant Hallelujah Isaiah 54 17 which is a favorite of mine done and it reads no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper that's right and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me say the Lord amen hallu knowing who you are by the word this is why brother BR gave us a message he said us things that he didn't give to the denominations Hallelujah in his message he basically did God showed us who we were in the message the unveiling of God he wasn't just talking about himself he was talking about all of us who have been predestinated those of us who were with him before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and as long as you go the way you're going I don't know whether some of y'all mad or just sleepy but let me say it like this every attitude in this place is being recorded and so you understand if I'm a preach a message and you're mad with me I don't care I really don't care that's your thing that you got to deal with y'all have no idea what I go through sometimes with spirits and I'm not calling no names I'm just saying Ephesians 1:4 no weapon formed against me nobody Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in [Music] Love Now do you believe that why are we struggling with salvation then if you you got the Holy Ghost in you and you know that that Holy Ghost is maturing you taking you to your trials you fall you get back up and you try it again and God is in the moving God is in the making and a lot of times we go ahead I'm sorry A lot of times we think because hardship come God ain't in it God is in it you don't understand it I guess but even brother brand said God is a warrior well if he's a warrior that means he love battles hallelujah hallelujah your battles are ordained by God hallelujah but what we need to do is step back and let God fight your battles Hallelujah yes sir you got to understand your grace we say the Lord is my Buckler the Lord is my shield the Lord is my sword Hallelujah all I all God ask me to do is to put on the whole arm of God but he is the one that fights the battle the armor that I put on is to keep me from getting hurt doing the battle somebody help me here oh people I love this Romans 8 I'm trying to hurry 33-39 he didn't chose us folks I'm happy about that if the Devil comes to you you going say I'm chosen of God you even you've got to say it enough to convince yourself I'm chosen of God that's right right nothing can hurt me nothing can turn me around somebody even if the preacher don't go I'm going all the way y'all better help me oh it's the truth hallelujah but don't worry I'm going hallelujah hallelujah here's my thing right here Romans 8 3339 who shall lay anything H to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifi you say God ain't like that yes he is Jo friends accused him who going to L in charge the God's elect hallelu God said job you better go pray for him because if you don't pray for them they won't be forgiven Hallelujah Jo had to go pray for his friends in order for God to restore them sometimes these people who become your enemy if you don't pray for them they won't be restored who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y rather that is is risen is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercessions for us oh Lord have mercy who shall separate us from the love of Christ Paul had an experience shall tribulation or distress a persecution or famine and every one of us are going through something like that hallelujah or nakedness or Peril that's dangerous times or or sword Hallelujah who as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter but you know what people get mad when problems come and they say why me because you are who you are I want to be like Jesus you want to be like Jesus you going to suffer like Jesus that's the way it go you can't inherit he heaven like this [Music] Lord and don't be like Adam Lord that woman you gave y'all know it's the truth some of Y Brothers y'all know how that is hallelujah What About Eve at least she know she know know the devil did it let's move on that was for somebody nay in all these things we are more than conquerors to him that love us for I am persuaded let hear everybody say that I am persuaded that neither death nor life No Angels no principalities no power not things present I'm going say that again not things present not things present nor things to come neither height nor dep or any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord hallelu glory to God glory to God glory to God I'm feeling pretty good here tonight this morning give me one more quote if you don't mind I I I'm not going to be able to finish this message but anyway coming from the message the invisible Union of BL of Christ brother brandham says paragraph 270 you The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ I love that word precious sinless son of God standing with a pure un unadulterated bride word he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become fresh and manifested manifest that he might take you right which were predestinated in the bosom of Hallelujah before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God whatever you are you are a servant of God you got to believe it you got to believe it whatever God wants you to do where your place is God placed in the church some Apostles prophets teachers pastors Hallelujah he placed that virtue of his own predestination and you were that to begin with I I'm not ready I'm not done yet God placed you here hallelu God did it I didn't knock on nobody's door God brought you here and if he brought you here he brought you here for a purpose hallelujah hallelujah we going to make this thing y'all hear me we're going to make it Hallelujah yes we are Hallelujah the first glory to God I believe that with all my heart Hallelujah paragraph 272 your first wedding was a n it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could thing could do it and that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water the washing of the Water by the word the word was not denomination the word wash you Hallelujah he said but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you're going to be washed you still as spotted as eeve Hallelujah see faith is that substance brother call Faith the six sense faith is the Revelation I know I'm of God hallelujah he anointed me with a revelation that I am the word manifested you are the word manifested hallelujah you said well brother Brooks I make mistakes so did Peter so did John soed Paul sold did William but they still the word hallelujah God is not looking at your mistakes he looking at the commission he's looking at the call it is the grace of God that God has given in our hearts Hallelujah one more Jeremiah 29 Hallelujah like God ain't stupid God knows exactly what he's doing we just need to get on board Hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying you can't save nobody and many times we spend so much time trying to save people PR for them if they're savable God will save them Jeremiah 29 11 23 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of Peace So when the devil call make you think God is against you say uhhuh he got good thoughts concerning me Hallelujah and not of evil to give you an expected end then you shall call upon me and shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you so when you go to prayer devil say God ain't going to hear you give him this word give him this word hallelujah he is that right he said when you pray unto me I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart let's stand I'm going to have you sit back sit back there I forgot I needed to say a few things Church of the Living God I I want to say these things to you I'm serious about what I'm doing I'm a man just like everybody else I I do make mistakes but when it come to making a Rapture that's my focus I God is uh got me as he has me as a as the pastor of this church we don't have deacons here right it's not like the position is not open but I don't want nobody to come up here religiously wanting to be a if you don't have a call in your life cuz I don't need to be fighting with caral deacons yall understand what I'm saying it would be easier in a way because some of the things that I have to deal with I wouldn't have to deal with it now I'm going tell y'all something that we going to have to get in we got to do better with the word the Bible said if you see a man overtaken in the fault you supposed to go to that man and you go with love you don't go with that finger pointing no no no you go in love and you go in a humble way you don't even have to tell nobody what you're getting ready to do we're keepers of one another is that right I've had uh so many different situations come up in this church and it's been quite difficult for me to even judge but some of y'all know the situation I'm going to speak of I'm not going to call no name but we've got a a situation here where where a a couple want to divorce and now the couple who wanted divorce saying they never was married how can you divorce if you never was married you mean to tell me you going to live up in this church for all those years prod producing babies and you going to tell me now we never was married that means you sat in this church as a fornicator or adulterer and now you telling me you got a way out there is no way out no it's true I believe in one man and one woman I'm sorry no no no I'm not sorry no now if you have been a product of of of of of um what what's that word I'm trying to polygamy you you there's nothing you could do about that I was a product of sin I'm a product of sin but my way out was to become a new Creature if you did that before you came to the message you got to go on and live the way you live but you're not bringing that in here I'm sorry if I find out that you've already married and then you go back to Africa and marry somebody else automatically automatically you have dis You' separated yourself from this assembly I don't care who you are and my thing is you're guilty of a sin if you encourage a brother like I told him you can get if you want to divorce you want to separate go ahead and do it but show me in the message where you can get remarried only under one condition and that's fornication you said for fornication and adult is the same it is not the same fornication is before you get Mar before the ceremony y understand me before you say I do don't call somebody your wife and she ain't your wife your confession has sealed you your confession he's my husband you I'm going to tell you something there is no way y'all don't know me man you don't know me but I'm not going to let you sit up in this church if I know you are out there committing fornication and those of you who know stuff like that just as guilty and you don't go to these people and straighten them out you don't have to bring them to me you are responsible You're Beautiful People the B person but don't let nobody steal your salvation and if you love one another you go to that brother or that sister and just like I told that brother cuz he went and married somebody else said married said he's not married he played the dollar but my point is this I said to him will you be satisfied because when you got an adulterous Spirit on you or you got a polygamy Spirit on you one woman ain't enough y looking at me I'm so glad y'all love me and if you don't agree with me there's other churches I'm just tell you I am not about a big church you can stay or you could go you understand me I would love for you to stay but you're not going to stay here as Sinners y'all hear me like I say oh I don't like Brother Bruce you don't put no food on my table no clothing on my back yall understand what I'm [Music] saying and how there's no leverage people say well you know most most of the you know what God called you the Lord I just said like this I believe it was the Lord I won't put it on him but I just believe it was Lord he said you got rebels in your church people who are deliberately rebelling he said but just as I took care of the rebels in Moses day I take care of the rebels in your church so I want you to know something here I don't nobody I don't know about other people ordination I don't know what they've been called to do but I have a work here and that work will be completed if it cost my life and if it come to the place there only two or three here maybe my wife and a few others that's fine with me because I know Jehovah you know what and he's Jehovah so I'm not trying to be mean but I want to be forceful enough for you to know that those of you who knew this was going on and you have known for month nobody came to talk to me and y'all always wait till the Apple get rotten CU so bad till you say here fix it brother I don't know how to fix that that just deserve trash trash am I making myself clear I don't mean no harm I there's some things I don't understand but it's not for me but I I'll say like this God understands everything and honestly some tells me that they're Brothers I don't know where you are here there I said now Lord I hope they ain't got a second wife then I went over there and got married again if you have you're not a part of this there's another church there's some Churches who believe in that I think you need to go Fellowship there and for those wives that you got to go through that craziness you said why would you say that we didn't know the truth at first we know the truth now don't ask me to marry you and you done been married already I'm telling you I have no hatred for the brother I love the brother my heart aches for for the brother because the brother should have come to his Pastor if I was his Pastor instead of going to instead of going to his buddies who encourag him to do that kind of thing he should have come to his pastor and let talk to me about it because I'm going to tell you something about a lust Spirit a lust Spirit doesn't have a face you understand what I mean that a l Spirit don't care if you white ugly a l Spirit don't care a l Spirit lust Spirit wants to satisfy its lust you love the Lord people I'm not take trying to take away your joy I talk about Grace but there are lines you can cross when the word of God has come to us and we choose to cross that line you you I know brother Bram talk about polygamy and marri but he started off it wasn't so in the beginning and then he began to explain to us why God allowed certain things once the word has been restored we supposed to follow the restored word now I don't know I'm getting ready to close but I remember my wife telling me a little story she hope she don't mind me saying it CU somebody came in my house when we first got married and was talking about I know Sister Ruby don't share it ain't just sister Ruby I don't share she don't share I don't share and the only people we share is with each other no I'm not a liberal I mean that and for those of us who have have a solid marriage if you've done it already that's you've done it I mean KN this brother knew what I stood for he yall understand me that's understand y'all looking so sad like it's you but I'm I'm just saying at what point in time you going to start loving other people like you love yourself here I am trying to produce a rapt I'm not a Rapture trying to get people into into into that atmosphere of a Rapture Desiring for uh uh uh Desiring U uh Revival and y'all holding that truth you you're holding things away you see people come and you know they're not living right I'm not talking about I'm not talking about gossip and saying things that you know you know you seen with your own eyes you know that's what I'm talking about because your first obligation is to go to that person that person don't hear you you take another person if you take two people and they don't hear bring it to the church then the church WIll judge that we've got wonderful sisters here and I I want those sisters especially those that are not married yet I pray for you brothers too I pray for you I'm going to say it like this don't you marry anybody nobody I don't care if they in the message and they Millionaires and they don't have the Holy Ghost you better leave that alone you understand what I'm saying if you marry somebody unequally yolked you going to be [Music] miserable I don't care who they are it is the holy spirit that makes us one watch the doctrine people say oh we all in the message no we're not brother Brandon said Moab and Israel had the same kind of altars seven altars seven Rams didn't they he said but they were different it was ba ba baac that caused them to sin by saying oh we all the same we are not all the same and because people got all of this up in the front of their Church don't mean their message believe us am I am I preaching the truth if you think this makes you the message you ignorant forgive me for but that's wrong you like understanding the message is the Holy Ghost the message is not the pictures some people have become Idol worshippers y'all looking at me I'm on a road so I'm as well finish it the same brass serpent that brought healing to Israel because the people start worshiping him became an idol and God had to tear it down the only thing that can't become an idol in that way is Jesus Christ himself you got to think about what your children is going to go through you can't be so selfish just to think about yourself because talking about inheritance they will inherit your positive they will inherit your positive and they will inherit your negative you love the Lord L Y I'm ready for that song brother you can put it up yes [Music] just think about it think about [Music] it help me sing it every day that pass me by I can see it in their eyes empty people filled with care headed who knows where on they go through private pain living fear to Fe left to hi their silent CES only Jesus here people need the Lord people need the Lord at the end of a broken dream he's the open door people need the Lord people need the Lord when we we realize people need the Lord [Music] we are called to take his life to a world where wrong seems arise what could be too great a cost for sharing life with one who's lost through his love our hearts can feel all the griefs They [Music] there they miss he the words of Life only we can share people need the Lord people need the Lord at the end of a broken dream he's the open door people need the
