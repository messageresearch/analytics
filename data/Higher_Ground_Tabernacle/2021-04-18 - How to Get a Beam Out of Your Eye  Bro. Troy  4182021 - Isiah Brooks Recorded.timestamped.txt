[59:37] moving in your age
[59:42] you need to start with your favorite
[1:00:04] and it was good that simon had this
[1:00:06] thought in his mind that he
[1:00:07] recognized that's there was a ministry
[1:00:09] there
[1:00:12] was
[1:01:02] the creator of the heavens and the earth
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:35] but it was the woman that walked by and
[1:01:36] glanced
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:02:05] ghost do you speak of the spirit that
[1:02:07] created the heavens and the earth
[1:02:13] this ministry deserves to have the
[1:02:15] preeminence
[1:02:18] of and even though she saw that he
[1:02:21] didn't have the preeminence in simon's
[1:02:23] house
[1:02:30] began to have the preeminence in her
[1:02:32] heart
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:03:28] a deep desire
[1:03:33] her heart strings began to be tugged to
[1:03:35] be tugging upon her heart
[1:03:41] christ began to have the preeminence
[1:04:52] the holy spirit in her age
[1:04:56] as the spirit began to act in her age
[1:05:03] she became entirely given over to the
[1:05:05] holy ghost
[1:05:06] of a new complex
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:48] lord

[1:12:19] worshiping her lord and savior
[1:12:47] the manifestation of the
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:02] those acts have been neglected
[1:13:07] there are many that that that that enjoy
[1:13:10] the ministry
[1:13:15] of this last day the
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:43] because we all have to
[1:13:57] and there are many that are in the house
[1:14:07] even though they're in simon's house
[1:14:09] maybe they could get one up and over
[1:14:11] simon
[1:14:12] he said
[1:14:35] each one trying to look a little better
[1:14:37] than the other ones
[1:14:40] oh
[1:14:54] [Music]

[1:16:05] is send me some of your favorite quotes
[1:16:07] sometime
[1:16:15] see what his treasure is
[1:16:32] maybe
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:58] and i was comparing verse 30 with verse
[1:18:01] 41
[1:18:05] because in verse 30 jesus had given a
[1:18:07] parable
[1:18:11] of the tares and the wheat
[1:18:16] but after jesus sent all the multitudes
[1:18:18] away
[1:18:23] disciples came to it says we want to
[1:18:25] know the interpretation of this parable
[1:18:29] so when you get to verse 41 there is
[1:18:32] jesus given the interpretation of the
[1:18:33] parable
[1:18:38] i was just sitting there
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:52] and
[1:19:06] sitting there studying at verse 41
[1:19:10] i go and i looked at my phone and that
[1:19:12] brother it sent me a quote
[1:19:19] and the quote was from a message in 1965
[1:19:23] called the seed of discrepancies
[1:19:31] where brother branham is preaching on
[1:19:33] this terrible
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:48] is
[1:20:44] a religion
[1:20:58] they
[1:21:05] these walls there's another dimension
[1:21:09] that
[1:21:09] can walk right through these walls
[1:22:07] christ is still making himself
[1:22:36] youngest
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:15] and you realize that there's things in
[1:24:17] your life that's contrary to the word of
[1:24:19] god
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:23] that you begin to have an opportunity
[1:24:28] for jesus christ
[1:24:42] to
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:11] the preeminence to the lord jesus christ
[1:25:22] and the thing about the baptism of the
[1:25:24] holy ghost
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:06] yourself to the adoption
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:23] at that point you gotta wait for god to
[1:26:25] do that things
[1:27:10] he said that there is the kingdom of
[1:27:11] heaven is like a man that sowed good
[1:27:13] seed in his field
[1:28:53] but notice that when jesus is given the
[1:28:56] interpretation of it
[1:29:01] and i was reading in verse 41
[1:29:06] let's read verse 40 here uh
[1:29:11] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[1:29:13] burned in the fire
[1:29:15] the feast
[1:29:18] verse 40. as therefore the tears are
[1:29:20] gathered and burned in the fire
[1:29:22] so shall
[1:29:40] said this has happened in each age but
[1:29:43] right here it's actually talking about
[1:29:45] the end of the world
