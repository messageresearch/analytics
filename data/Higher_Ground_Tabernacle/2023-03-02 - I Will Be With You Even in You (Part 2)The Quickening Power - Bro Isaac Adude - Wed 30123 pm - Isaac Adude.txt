don't understand y'all so we preached uh about this last Sunday here in the morning I think I the the title was I will be with you even in you so tonight we'll we'll try to continue with the same thought so it'll be the part two so the titles I will be with you even in you yeah man let's uh turn to John Chapter 14 verse 13 to 20. when the Bible says and whatsoever you shall ask in my name doubt will I do that the father may be glorified in the son is if you if if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments now verse 16 it says that and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever the verse says [Music] even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because he seeth him not neither nor was him but he nor him amen for he dwells with you and shall be in you veritas I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you had a little while and the world seeth me no more by ye see me because I leave you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you um here in verse 16 when Jesus said I will pray the father to send you another conference he wasn't talking about the second person he was talking about himself changing forms amen let's let's go to Romans chapter 8 verse 9 to verse 11. almost verses Romans chapter 8 verse 9 to verse 11. the Bible says that by you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his friend and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness is verse 11 and this is where I took my subtitles but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his Spirit at dwells amen that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised their Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwells in amen father God will come down the vinyl Lord in your presence tonight Lord as the song says Just As I Am Lord and worthy father as Sinners Dr Bishop Lord we come to you father God so that you can cleanse us Lord Lord you can clean us and Lord make us white when we pray father God that your spirit continue to be with us this evening and may may US Lord father God let us experience that quickening power Lord I pray father God that you be with me Lord that you take me out of the way father and you speak to your people Lord as I always say father God I pray that you make me so sensitive to the Holy Spirit father [Music] tonight we'll we'll be talking about a little subject uh it's called the quickening power there's no problems amen because in John chapter 14. amen there we see where Jesus was saying that I will pray the father to send you another comforter because Jesus was going to the end of his ministry as the son of man as Jesus the word made flesh that's because amen so he needed to change his form Allah so that he can continue to be with us because there was a greater promise coming but having gone promise so that the Jesus who was with us who was with the disciples now I had a promise that he has given that he will be in them in other words it will be men amen and God merging together because as we said it on on Sunday that in the beginning was in the beginning it was the word and the Word was made flesh and that word dwell and that word uh dwelled Among Us that word was that was Jesus Christ amen he he walked with us he did all kinds of things that a human Mania and human being can do yeah so that Jesus amen was still wanted to continue to have that fellowship with the human being so he wasn't gonna be the only Jesus being in one place being in one place at the time but now he gave his promise to be everywhere in other words to divide himself in different parts so that he can dwell inside of us it's like the prophet said that the word was made flesh and that word was Jesus is it at that time so now Jesus has died on the cross so he sent his Spirit back down on Earth so that the spirit cannot cannot can again become flesh focus on his crucified and become the bride because the bride and the Grooms are won and now he is the word made flesh because God can only use your feet God can only use your mouth you can only use your eyes to see in the book so you have become the Tabernacle of it means to be made alive after death meaning that you foreign but bear grain you may change uh uh uh you made a chance of wheat or of some other grain programs now verse 38 he says that but God giveth it a body as he has pleased him and to every seed his own body amen you have first to die and then you will and then that you will be quickened yeah so Paul Cantina University 42. now he's showing now the power of that quickening spirit that we can Empower him and gives you a Perfection it gives you the perfection in your body it says that so also is the resurrection of the Dead the NC on it is sun in corruption and [Music] your face being this of the resurrection of the perfect body
