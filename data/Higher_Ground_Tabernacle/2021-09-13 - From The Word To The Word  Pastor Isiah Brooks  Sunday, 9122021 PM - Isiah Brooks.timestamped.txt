[30:53] word of god
[30:55] surely god is good to us all my life
[31:00] he's been so faithful
[31:03] i can remember the times that
[31:07] god saved my life even when i was a
[31:09] sinner
[31:15] when i've been when i should have been
[31:16] caught by bullets
[31:18] gunfire
[31:20] he kept me safe
[31:23] when i should have been killed by a car
[31:24] accident
[31:26] he kept me safe
[31:31] and now that i look back i could see
[31:32] that he's been with me all along
[31:36] and i'm grateful tonight
[31:41] because he has been faithful
[31:46] as we stand we're going to turn to
[31:47] revelations the 10th chapter
[31:55] revelations 10.
[32:09] we're going to read verses 1 to 3.
[32:14] and i saw
[32:16] another mighty angel come down from
[32:18] heaven
[32:20] clothed with a cloud
[32:22] with a rainbow
[32:24] a rain and a rainbow was upon his head
[32:28] and his face was as it were the sun
[32:32] and his feet as pillars of fire
[32:35] and he had in his hand a little book
[32:38] opened
[32:40] and he said his right foot upon the sea
[32:44] and his left foot
[32:46] on the earth
[32:48] and he cried with the loud voice as when
[32:51] a lion roareth
[32:54] and when he had cried
[32:56] seven thunders
[32:58] uttered
[32:59] their voices
[33:03] let us pray
[33:05] father we thank you once again for your
[33:07] amazing grace
[33:09] we thank you for being so good to us
[33:11] lord
[33:13] there's no words that can express our
[33:15] gratitude
[33:17] the more we see and understand the more
[33:19] grateful we are
[33:21] father i pray that you keep our heart
[33:23] and mind
[33:25] so focused
[33:27] on this word and
[33:29] give us the grace to
[33:31] make ourselves ready
[33:33] for we realize oh god tonight that there
[33:35] is a
[33:36] translation taking place
[33:40] in one of these moments it'll all be
[33:42] over
[33:43] and father we pray for the people of god
[33:47] everywhere
[33:48] that you would keep our eyes stead on
[33:51] you forgive us of any sin and all sins
[33:54] that we have done
[33:55] that have not been pleasing in thy sight
[33:58] granted dear jesus in your lovely name
[34:01] we pray
[34:02] amen
[34:03] you may be seated
[34:08] we truly thank god for
[34:11] his amazing grace
[34:13] and we've been dealing with the coming
[34:15] of the lord
[34:17] we've been dealing with the rapture
[34:22] because of the
[34:24] truth
[34:26] we better understand what god is doing
[34:30] and like most of us we have all had our
[34:33] ideas of how
[34:35] the rapture is going to take place but i
[34:37] just want to
[34:38] encourage you
[34:40] on this
[34:42] that we don't have to worry about it
[34:45] because god interprets his own word
[34:48] and however god chooses to do it i don't
[34:51] think we'll have any complaints
[34:54] as long as we're part of that
[34:56] translation
[34:58] now we're at a time and we know uh
[35:01] brother branham talks about the mighty
[35:02] angel coming down and
[35:04] he also tells us that was the
[35:07] seven seals
[35:09] and how god really broke those seals
[35:12] himself
[35:14] and if you know anything about the seals
[35:16] you'll find out they were like scrolls
[35:18] rolled up
[35:20] and you had seven of those scrolls
[35:22] rolled up and then of course
[35:24] that last seal would be
[35:26] uh the seventh and that seal had to be
[35:28] broken before the any of the others
[35:30] could be seen or opened
[35:33] so we realized by god's grace that we've
[35:36] had a great thing to occur in our day
[35:38] and i don't know whether we're really
[35:40] recognizing the impact
[35:43] of it
[35:44] because now that we have been smitten
[35:47] and we can't be in the seventh church
[35:48] age we can't be in laodicea because if
[35:51] you are you you're in that spirit of
[35:53] rich increase with good and you know
[35:56] you're naked blind and you don't know it
[35:57] and have need of nothing and i don't
[35:59] think any of us can actually say that
[36:01] we're underneath that inspiration
[36:04] but what we need to see by god's grace
[36:06] is that god has placed us in
[36:08] an invisible age or an inter eternal age
[36:11] an age that even the word or i could say
[36:14] the world don't even know exists had we
[36:17] not a prophet we wouldn't know it
[36:19] but he taught us by god's grace about
[36:21] the eighth day
[36:23] and that eighth day was in the bible
[36:25] according to old testament as a holy
[36:27] convocation
[36:28] and he said really in reality there is
[36:30] no eighth day but that
[36:33] first that that first day goes back that
[36:36] eighth day goes back to the first day
[36:39] and so we understand that now we're in
[36:41] the beginning of a new
[36:43] age if we want to say it that way
[36:46] and in this age it's the age of life
[36:49] now when we were in denominations and
[36:52] organizations you know you almost had
[36:54] like deuteronomy and effect
[36:56] you had the law of life and you had the
[36:58] law of death and that's what deuteronomy
[37:00] is two laws
[37:01] and in those two laws you either
[37:03] experience death by not
[37:06] disobeying or life by obeying
[37:09] but we realize now that the law that
[37:11] we're under is the law of grace and the
[37:13] law of love
[37:14] and the law of grace and love has placed
[37:17] us into
[37:18] a condition where brother branham
[37:20] describe it as an uh unconditional
[37:26] love or
[37:27] unconditional
[37:29] um how can i say it he he showed us by
[37:32] god's grace that
[37:34] god's favor
[37:35] has placed us into an unconditional
[37:38] covenant that's the word
[37:40] so you it doesn't give us the right to
[37:42] sin or the right to uh do anything
[37:45] that's contrary like oh i can just do
[37:47] anything i want to
[37:49] and he said if that be the case if you
[37:50] did things that are contrary to the word
[37:53] then in reality you really don't have
[37:55] what you think you have because if you
[37:57] truly love god you'll do your best to
[37:59] keep his commandments
[38:02] we are of a different seed
[38:04] we're not the seed of any denomination
[38:07] or organization and that's why this is
[38:09] why we must be careful brother random
[38:11] also tells us that if we say i am a
[38:14] methodist i am a lutheran or something
[38:16] like that he said right there you die
[38:19] and you know he said we must say we are
[38:22] of christ or we are of the word because
[38:26] the word cannot die
[38:28] and so i was saying all of these things
[38:31] because
[38:32] when this word came to us
[38:36] and we we saw the mighty angel come down
[38:39] oftentimes i used to wonder what you
[38:42] know one foot on the land and one foot
[38:44] on the seat
[38:45] not even thinking
[38:47] you know of kingdoms because you got to
[38:49] understand that this mighty angel came
[38:52] down to conquer
[38:53] and to shout the victory
[38:55] that's what the shout
[38:57] and the voice and the trump all of these
[38:58] things were literally shouting victory
[39:02] that the lamb had taken the book
[39:03] remember
[39:04] the bible says amen that john wept
[39:07] because there was no man worthy to take
[39:10] the book
[39:11] he said had not there been someone to
[39:13] take the book we all would have been
[39:16] lost
[39:17] now i want you to really think about
[39:19] that because john who had the holy ghost
[39:23] who laid in the bosom of jesus right who
[39:26] was part of the twelve
[39:28] had not the lamb taking the book
[39:31] all of his experience would have been
[39:33] nullified
[39:34] would have been of no value
[39:37] because it had that last episode that
[39:39] last what you call drama of calvary had
[39:42] to take place
[39:44] john said amen when he heard the lion
[39:47] roar or when he heard the lion he looked
[39:50] he looked to see a lion but when he
[39:53] turned around he saw a bloody lamb and
[39:56] so we can understand what the lamb was
[39:58] all about
[40:00] it was the lamb in the beginning
[40:01] remember
[40:02] amen when adam and eve sinned it was a
[40:05] lamb that god slew for their sins lamb
[40:08] is the most innocent
[40:10] of all uh uh creatures uh he he needs a
[40:14] shepherd and that's why we call jesus
[40:17] christ our great shepherd because he
[40:19] liken us as to sheep so we understand
[40:22] that even in the garden of eden the lamb
[40:26] was unveiled
[40:28] it was skinned it was taken the skin of
[40:31] the lamb was unveiled the lamb was
[40:33] unveiled and he took those coats of skin
[40:35] and he clothed adam and eve's nakedness
[40:39] now we must understand that adam and eve
[40:41] a man had on uh
[40:44] fig leaf aprons
[40:46] but
[40:47] adam knew that even with the religion or
[40:49] the act that he had performed he still
[40:52] saw himself naked
[40:54] and the question was asked out asked
[40:57] that god asked adam who told you you was
[41:00] naked so we go right back to the serpent
[41:03] right and we know by god's grace that
[41:05] the serpent calls the mess or the
[41:07] trouble because it was his seed who that
[41:10] came forth out of the womb e of eve
[41:13] first
[41:14] so and it was caused by sex but
[41:17] nevertheless let's go on so by god's
[41:19] grace the lamb takes the book
[41:22] and the lamb uh um
[41:26] was the only one worthy christ jesus
[41:28] he's the only perfect man that ever
[41:30] exists on the earth and the only way we
[41:34] receive our perfection is because we are
[41:36] accepted
[41:38] in him
[41:39] and uh so we thank god for that now you
[41:42] say well brother books where where are
[41:44] you going with this i'm going with this
[41:46] new creation because a lot of times i
[41:49] mean i could say like this throughout my
[41:51] own christian life i miss that scripture
[41:55] that we are to be a new creation
[41:59] and old things are passed away and
[42:02] behold all things have become new
[42:04] now that is a challenge that is
[42:06] something that you and i must understand
[42:09] this must become a reality
[42:11] because having the holy ghost doesn't
[42:14] mean that your life is going to be
[42:16] patched up
[42:17] at some point in time you must die
[42:21] completely rot to your will
[42:24] and god must have complete control
[42:28] over your life you understand me
[42:31] in the way that brother branham said the
[42:33] devil will not won't know what to do
[42:35] with you
[42:37] he's he's teased you he's threatening
[42:38] you he's he's caused you to fall but now
[42:41] you so work you walk so circumspectly
[42:43] with god till now he's confused because
[42:46] all of his old tricks
[42:49] won't and won't work for you
[42:52] so this is what the message does for you
[42:54] this is what the word will do for you
[42:57] this is why it's important that we lay
[42:59] in the presence of the sun that means
[43:02] those books those tapes this bible we
[43:05] must lay there we must stay there as
[43:07] often as we possibly can because that's
[43:10] where rapturing faith
[43:12] lie
[43:13] or lay we
[43:15] who are of god understand that we have
[43:18] been quickened
[43:19] you know people say well everybody say
[43:21] well you've been quickened
[43:23] you already been quickened just so the
[43:25] life of the seed has already quickened
[43:28] you
[43:29] otherwise you wouldn't have a desire for
[43:31] this do you really think it's your flesh
[43:33] that want the word
[43:35] they're enemies
[43:37] they're enemies
[43:38] it's your soul that has been quickened
[43:41] by the word of god
[43:43] so you've got life because you love to
[43:46] hear the word right even paul says i
[43:49] find it difficult
[43:50] at times to do the will of god because
[43:54] he says every time i try to do good evil
[43:56] is there
[43:57] right and he has a battle everybody has
[44:00] a battle right
[44:01] remember the time amen the old indian
[44:04] chief was talking to brother branham and
[44:06] and he was telling brother branham how
[44:08] he has a hard time sometime
[44:10] and uh he and brother branham says uh
[44:13] he said always these two dogs fighting a
[44:15] black dog and a white dog he said well
[44:18] which one when he said the one that i
[44:20] feed the most and so if you feed that
[44:23] unnatural nature the most he's going to
[44:26] win
[44:27] but it doesn't mean that the white dog
[44:30] is dead and dead you understand me but
[44:33] what i'm trying to say is is that you
[44:36] your feeding habits your your your your
[44:39] uh
[44:40] uh appetite
[44:42] or your desires must change
[44:45] even as a woman when she's pregnant her
[44:48] her desires her food
[44:50] changes
[44:51] things that she once liked to eat she
[44:54] may not
[44:55] want that kind of stuff anymore and you
[44:57] know she might want something as
[44:59] delicious as ice cream and pickles
[45:03] but it's what the baby is crying for as
[45:05] to what the baby is calling for
[45:08] right you know i always before i won't
[45:11] say always but oftentimes i said lord
[45:14] you choose me a message to listen to
[45:18] give me because i go and i'm gonna tell
[45:20] you something it always work
[45:23] it always work there's always something
[45:25] there for me now let me go on by the
[45:29] grace of god so when when this
[45:31] mighty angel put his uh one foot on a
[45:35] land and one on the sea you know i was
[45:37] just thinking he was just conquering the
[45:39] world and in reality he was
[45:42] but understand we're working with
[45:44] religious demons you understand me the
[45:47] battle that we're fighting we're almost
[45:49] at the end of this thing and the battle
[45:52] that we're fighting did not start
[45:55] on earth it started in heaven
[45:58] when lucifer tried to overtake heaven
[46:02] god kicked him out
[46:03] then he came down into the garden of
[46:05] eden he deceived the serpent the
[46:08] serpents he deceived eve and this is
[46:10] where sin came in
[46:12] and from that point on
[46:15] the battle
[46:17] field became the mind
[46:20] and this is why the prophet god said
[46:22] that the greatest battle ever fought is
[46:24] in your mind why in this day paul didn't
[46:28] preach of nothing like that paul said
[46:30] put on the whole arm of god he covered
[46:33] the mind he covered the head but you see
[46:35] he didn't focus
[46:38] why because this is the age of the
[46:40] headship
[46:42] as god has come to uh uh uh be uh come
[46:45] the headship of his body satan wants to
[46:48] become the headship of god's body
[46:52] you see what i'm saying so he's they're
[46:54] two both fighting
[46:56] for your mind
[46:58] this is why we have all the battles he's
[47:01] the spirit of unbelief and god is the
[47:03] spirit of belief
[47:05] hallelujah and jesus said if you if you
[47:08] believe all things are possible
[47:11] to you
[47:13] now you and i must understand there's no
[47:15] good in us nothing we can do nothing
[47:18] nothing good in this flesh so
[47:20] we must destroy the flesh
[47:23] now you understand what i mean by that
[47:26] we must be destroying the flesh is the
[47:29] denying the flesh appetites
[47:32] hallelujah whenever the devil crave
[47:36] you you give him something healthy to
[47:38] eat the word of god
[47:39] [Laughter]
[47:42] amen because you and i know that the
[47:44] craving
[47:46] is better than the reality
[47:48] did you know that how many times you've
[47:50] seen a piece of chocolate cake or some
[47:52] piece of fried chicken or whatever the
[47:54] case may be in the natural smells good
[47:57] looks good and you go buy it
[48:00] and it ain't so good
[48:02] but the craving was delicious
[48:06] you could smell it you could taste it it
[48:08] was almost a reality to you that's the
[48:11] way sin is
[48:16] right
[48:16] the craving is better than the reality
[48:20] hallelujah
[48:22] but not with god
[48:24] the more you crave him
[48:26] the better it gets
[48:28] hallelujah so
[48:31] we understand
[48:33] the the religious realm
[48:37] what beast
[48:39] came out of the sea
[48:43] the beast that came out of the sea
[48:46] the one that had the so what seven heads
[48:49] or ten heads however it was that was
[48:52] that religious spirit
[48:54] that we know as the catholic church
[48:57] and what what
[49:01] beast if i want to say came out of the
[49:03] earth
[49:04] revelations 13
[49:06] came out looking like a lamb
[49:09] but transformed itself into a dragon
[49:13] so when jesus christ descended
[49:16] he was placing one foot on catholicism
[49:19] and the other footed on protestantism
[49:22] and said to you
[49:24] is impossible
[49:26] for the bride of jesus christ
[49:28] to be deceived
[49:30] why because he brought you an open book
[49:34] and in that open book you can see every
[49:37] trick
[49:38] and trade that the enemy has done
[49:42] we're not ignorance of the devil's
[49:44] devices
[49:46] from genesis to revelation
[49:49] hallelujah if you know the enemy's moves
[49:53] there's no way he can defeat you
[49:55] hallelujah and this is why god
[49:58] has given us understanding and what did
[50:00] he say whatever you do don't you join
[50:04] the world council of churches
[50:07] is that what he said
[50:09] and he said listen he said
[50:12] it's not china
[50:14] the bamboo curtain
[50:16] is not the thing that threatens us
[50:18] he said not even russia
[50:21] but he said keep your eyes on the what
[50:24] purple curtain
[50:27] hallelujah
[50:29] he said because that's where the mark of
[50:31] the beast comes in at
[50:34] hallelujah he was the one that told us
[50:37] it's not a chip
[50:42] he was the one it was god coming down
[50:44] showing us in the open book
[50:48] that we don't have to fear those kind of
[50:50] things but we must not be a part of the
[50:53] system
[50:55] hallelujah because remember amen being a
[50:58] part of the system is so dangerous
[51:01] because it is the system that brings the
[51:03] mark of the beast
[51:05] right because the systematic worship is
[51:08] lucifer in disguise
[51:11] oh yes
[51:14] cain and abel
[51:15] go all the way back to genesis
[51:17] lucifer or the devil serpent however you
[51:20] want to say cain amen had a
[51:22] well-organized way of worship
[51:26] he actually went before the throne and
[51:29] the altar of god with with his worship
[51:31] and god rejected him
[51:34] and that same kind of worship is
[51:36] referred to the worship that we are now
[51:38] seeing in babylon beautiful worship
[51:41] beautiful choirs beautiful preachers
[51:44] everything is beautiful
[51:46] but it lacks the blood
[51:52] and the only way there is remission of
[51:54] sin
[51:56] the blood must be applied
[51:59] and so you see by god's grace while the
[52:02] book is open this is why we have victory
[52:06] because the mighty angel came down with
[52:09] the book the open book in his hand
[52:12] and now we see the conquest can you
[52:15] imagine
[52:18] what it must have been like when john
[52:19] saw his name on the book
[52:23] and the prophet god said it wasn't like
[52:25] john saw the word john on the book
[52:30] it's a
[52:30] revelation
[52:32] it's not like a book like this
[52:35] but it's a revelation
[52:37] and whatever it looks like amen
[52:40] it's eternal
[52:42] this is not eternal
[52:45] these pages can be burnt
[52:48] you hear me
[52:49] these pages can be burnt this book can
[52:52] be destroyed but the words
[52:55] that's on the book is eternal
[52:58] and it cannot be destroyed
[53:00] be destroyed you see so when he when you
[53:03] say oh brother i heard and i should
[53:05] think well you know when the lord calls
[53:07] my name how do i know when the lord has
[53:10] my name is on the long book of life
[53:13] you know how
[53:14] you responded
[53:17] to the message called
[53:19] when everybody else rejected it
[53:21] they didn't hear it
[53:23] they couldn't hear it they weren't
[53:25] ordained to hear it but you heard it in
[53:28] your spirit in your soul and you knew it
[53:30] was right
[53:32] that was god calling you
[53:36] hello y'all understand what he's calling
[53:38] you for
[53:39] he's calling you for the wedding supper
[53:43] hallelujah he's calling you to the
[53:45] marriage of the lamb
[53:47] not to an organization or denomination
[53:49] he's calling you to something that is
[53:52] super super super amen more super than
[53:55] you and i can imagine
[53:59] it is an eight it's an optic higher as i
[54:02] heard him say an arctic higher a man
[54:06] than
[54:07] leo deceiver
[54:09] and the arctic as i understand is eight
[54:12] notes higher
[54:13] can you imagine
[54:15] taking us up that higher and this is
[54:17] what he told john come up higher come up
[54:21] because this is the only way you can see
[54:23] the reality
[54:25] of what eternity is all about
[54:27] time travel amen we know john did that
[54:31] and one day we're going to do it
[54:34] hallelujah amen one day the portals of
[54:37] heaven is going to open up
[54:39] you understand what i'm saying these
[54:41] things are available because the lamb
[54:44] took the book
[54:46] [Music]
[54:47] what did it do
[54:49] give us back our rights
[54:53] gave us back our authority
[54:56] and the only way that this is going to
[54:58] work for you is that you have to have
[55:00] faith to believe that it is for you
[55:04] hallelujah we don't know when god said
[55:08] let there be light
[55:10] we have no idea how long it took
[55:13] for light to break forth
[55:15] but one thing for certain god never
[55:18] doubted his word y'all hear what i just
[55:21] said
[55:22] god never doubts his word and if god
[55:24] said if you could ask whatsoever you
[55:26] will and believe that you shall receive
[55:29] it why do you doubt
[55:31] because if that's god's word god cannot
[55:34] come back void
[55:36] and the only thing that can make that
[55:38] turn is your lack of faith
[55:42] you understand me
[55:44] god is not the problem
[55:48] we're the problem
[55:52] listen in invisible union and we
[55:54] understand that that's what that is this
[55:56] is why a lot of people say i'm the bride
[55:58] with that term bride is really
[56:01] not
[56:02] supposed to remain
[56:05] somewhere there's supposed to be an
[56:07] invisible union
[56:09] right
[56:10] remember amen the old rancher's story
[56:13] about the rancher who was looking for a
[56:16] a wife or his son and sent his son out
[56:19] there to find a wife and you know of
[56:22] course they had all of those pretty
[56:23] little girls doing what they do and then
[56:25] he found a little girl amen in the
[56:27] backyard dishwashing everything else who
[56:28] was related amen to the to the girls in
[56:32] the living room
[56:33] right
[56:35] but there was a a time
[56:38] when the girls in the living room
[56:41] had no idea what was going on in the
[56:44] backyard
[56:46] i'm speaking scripture here
[56:48] see in the back of the book
[56:51] something was going on that the people
[56:53] in the front had no idea because you got
[56:56] to remember the book was sealed within
[56:58] and without
[57:00] hallelujah the same way noah's ark was
[57:04] sealed in with pitch in and without
[57:08] hallelujah and the bride of jesus christ
[57:10] must be sealed within and without
[57:15] hallelujah
[57:16] amen
[57:18] and what was happening
[57:21] there was a time
[57:23] when that ranch's son
[57:26] asked her
[57:28] to be his wife
[57:30] and she said me
[57:33] see that's the way that's the real
[57:34] response
[57:35] it's not like i know you was gonna ask
[57:37] me you know what i'm saying no that
[57:39] wasn't the attitude
[57:41] she felt very unworthy of the calling
[57:44] a real bride seed always feel unworthy
[57:47] of the calling
[57:49] who me
[57:50] i'm the least of all
[57:52] why me
[57:54] because i have watched you
[57:57] and i've seen your character
[58:00] right
[58:02] and she says okay i do
[58:07] you know how it is you hesitate for a
[58:09] while you don't want the man to know
[58:10] you're that anxious so you kind of hold
[58:12] up a little bit
[58:14] i do
[58:16] he said hold fast you just be faithful
[58:19] to like come right that's all he asked
[58:21] us to do
[58:22] be faithful to the word
[58:25] doesn't mean you're not going to make
[58:26] mistakes but be faithful to the word
[58:29] do whatever you can do to be faithful to
[58:31] the word
[58:32] and when i return
[58:34] well
[58:35] everybody nobody knew
[58:39] the arrangement that took place
[58:41] on the back of the book
[58:46] because what was on the back of the book
[58:48] wasn't written
[58:50] hallelujah
[58:52] and it was a secret it was something
[58:54] nobody could see it was like adam laying
[58:56] there standing there with his feminine
[58:59] part in him and even the animals that
[59:02] that was around him never knew
[59:04] adam had a mate
[59:08] it was a secret
[59:10] until one day god laid him to sleep a
[59:12] deep sleep brother and said that was
[59:14] like death
[59:16] and pulled his feminine part out of him
[59:19] and formed a wife
[59:21] and adam knew immediately who she was
[59:25] what she was and what she was going to
[59:27] do
[59:28] see god knows
[59:30] every mistake we make god knows he knew
[59:33] he was going to make it before we make
[59:35] it made it yet he chose you why because
[59:38] you came from him
[59:42] that's what the blood is all about
[59:44] he knows your weaknesses he he knew that
[59:48] before he even put your name on the land
[59:50] book of life but what we fail to see is
[59:53] that the reason why he could do that
[59:56] is because you came from him
[59:59] you understand me
[1:00:01] you came from him
[1:00:03] and adam knew
[1:00:05] this is bone of my bone
[1:00:08] and flesh of my flesh now he's waking up
[1:00:10] from a resurrection if i would say it
[1:00:12] like that he's resurrecting back to life
[1:00:15] and he sees this beast
[1:00:18] look like himself but in a different
[1:00:20] form and he already knows where she come
[1:00:22] from
[1:00:25] it was god
[1:00:26] god is not making any mistakes he knows
[1:00:29] those the bible said the lord knoweth
[1:00:31] them that are his
[1:00:33] he knows you came from him
[1:00:36] guess what this is the part i like
[1:00:40] adam didn't have a choice
[1:00:45] for a wife
[1:00:48] neither did god
[1:00:51] because there was no other
[1:00:54] there was no other he was the only god
[1:00:58] and there was none like him no other and
[1:01:00] the feminine part there was no other
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:04] so he's basically showing us amen how
[1:01:07] secure you and i are
[1:01:10] because if we came from him we'll go
[1:01:12] back to him
[1:01:14] and what did he do
[1:01:16] he says listen he knew
[1:01:19] now maybe you don't understand it but we
[1:01:21] would have never had fathers and mothers
[1:01:25] husbands and wives
[1:01:28] it wouldn't have been like that
[1:01:30] but adam one of the first things he said
[1:01:32] to to uh uh eve he says you know
[1:01:35] basically you know you must leave father
[1:01:37] and mother
[1:01:39] and cleave
[1:01:41] to your husband
[1:01:42] right
[1:01:44] but that came by the fall
[1:01:46] we were all supposed to be brothers and
[1:01:49] sisters
[1:01:51] say that ain't right yes it is
[1:01:54] even in in the in the old old testament
[1:01:57] when when adam and eve fell even after
[1:01:59] they failed what were they marrying who
[1:02:01] were they marrying their brothers and
[1:02:03] their sisters
[1:02:05] and when you get to heaven who are you
[1:02:07] going to see
[1:02:08] your brothers and your sisters
[1:02:12] they're no longer your husband
[1:02:14] it's no longer your wife even though you
[1:02:16] might be together there is no such thing
[1:02:18] as that kind of a marriage in heaven
[1:02:21] everybody's going to be brother
[1:02:24] is that right
[1:02:25] my precious brother my precious sister
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:30] because in that in that in that in that
[1:02:32] day amen in that time
[1:02:34] the reproduction is over
[1:02:39] all the sons and of daughters of god has
[1:02:41] been made manifest
[1:02:43] is that right even though we can't
[1:02:45] number them
[1:02:47] they're all there
[1:02:49] and guess what
[1:02:50] god said he never lost one
[1:02:53] so you say well what do you mean brother
[1:02:55] but why because the book is open we know
[1:02:58] we came from god and we go back to god
[1:03:02] that's the victory
[1:03:04] do you suffer yes
[1:03:06] it's part of the fall
[1:03:09] hallelujah but god told israel can i
[1:03:11] forget you
[1:03:13] he said i could never forget you why
[1:03:16] because you're written in the palms of
[1:03:17] my hand
[1:03:19] hallelujah
[1:03:21] let me move on by god's grace
[1:03:24] you say what brother brooks where are
[1:03:25] you going with this
[1:03:28] you see you can be seed and not yet
[1:03:30] quickened
[1:03:34] because jesus disciples followed him
[1:03:37] they knew he was the word
[1:03:39] they believed he was the messiah
[1:03:42] but they had not yet received the holy
[1:03:44] ghost
[1:03:45] you understand me
[1:03:47] brother branham was a seed born a
[1:03:49] prophet
[1:03:50] he had to come to salvation like
[1:03:52] everybody else
[1:03:54] he had to repent he had to be baptized
[1:03:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:03:58] and he had received the holy ghost
[1:04:01] it didn't stop there
[1:04:03] he himself had to come to what we call
[1:04:06] the statue of a perfect man
[1:04:09] and whether you remember you remember
[1:04:11] the time when brother branham said he
[1:04:13] was there in that auditorium and and
[1:04:15] here it was this couple was making out
[1:04:18] on the front row
[1:04:19] it was a test because the angel of the
[1:04:21] lord had already told him you're going
[1:04:23] to be tested
[1:04:25] and he kept telling the young people
[1:04:27] stop stop don't do that
[1:04:29] and the more he told them to stop the
[1:04:30] worse they became
[1:04:32] and the angel said whatever you say
[1:04:34] remember the third pool was in order
[1:04:37] he could have spoke whatever he
[1:04:40] would speak on those people blindness
[1:04:42] death crippled whatever
[1:04:46] it would have happened
[1:04:50] but something moved him
[1:04:52] and i'm saying this this is very very
[1:04:55] very important in what i was i'm going
[1:04:57] to say
[1:04:59] the devil was agitating
[1:05:02] pushing him
[1:05:04] to bring forth a judgment
[1:05:08] remember
[1:05:09] and whatever that judgment would have
[1:05:12] been god would have honored it
[1:05:15] but what god was looking for
[1:05:19] was the lamb's nature
[1:05:25] remember john said i saw a lion brother
[1:05:28] branham could have been a lion he could
[1:05:30] have roared it out
[1:05:31] he could have made the judgment it would
[1:05:33] have been so
[1:05:34] but you guess what he did
[1:05:37] that was his last step
[1:05:40] that was the crown he needed
[1:05:42] that was the victory he needed now i
[1:05:45] didn't know this because i was at a camp
[1:05:46] meeting and the brother was telling me
[1:05:48] that the brethren said that after that
[1:05:51] meeting brother brannon was outside of
[1:05:53] the building shouting i made it i it you
[1:05:57] know he understood he needed that was
[1:05:59] the victory he needed and you know what
[1:06:01] he said
[1:06:03] i forgive you
[1:06:07] well what about stephen
[1:06:10] stephen had the holy ghost
[1:06:13] and whatever judgment stephen would have
[1:06:16] made god would have required it
[1:06:21] and i always think about this all the
[1:06:23] time
[1:06:24] had stephen said may you all drop dead
[1:06:28] they would have
[1:06:31] but if he had said that we would have
[1:06:33] been missing the first church age angel
[1:06:36] the messenger saul
[1:06:39] he was there
[1:06:40] he was pushing it
[1:06:42] he was laughing whatever he was doing he
[1:06:44] was cheering them on kill him stoned him
[1:06:48] and had he given the wrong judgment or
[1:06:52] the wrong sentence god would have
[1:06:53] honored it then things would have been
[1:06:54] messed up but you know what he said
[1:06:57] forgive them
[1:06:59] for they know not what they do
[1:07:02] hold not these things to their charge he
[1:07:05] spoke almost the same words jesus spoke
[1:07:08] at a time of crucifixion
[1:07:10] why are you speaking this brother brooks
[1:07:12] because the squeeze is coming
[1:07:15] the pressure is coming
[1:07:16] you can't fight with the sword
[1:07:19] hallelujah love will conquer this age
[1:07:24] the lamb if i can say it like this
[1:07:27] conquered the dragon
[1:07:32] that's where god is bringing us to
[1:07:33] perfect love every age must come to that
[1:07:36] perfection
[1:07:37] because they can't be perfect without us
[1:07:40] and that's why you say well uh me and
[1:07:42] brother was saying there's so many
[1:07:44] people
[1:07:45] dying now or leaving us and message
[1:07:48] believers you know with this kovac and
[1:07:49] everything else but you know what god is
[1:07:51] collecting that's all he's doing
[1:07:53] and he's thinning down the number
[1:07:58] amen
[1:07:59] so when this pressure comes it ain't
[1:08:01] going to be no whole lot of folks you
[1:08:02] got to deal with
[1:08:04] it's going to be a few
[1:08:06] is that right that's why brother brown
[1:08:08] said you won't worry about doctrine then
[1:08:11] you'll be so glad to see a real
[1:08:14] christian amen
[1:08:16] standing for the word of god amen
[1:08:19] hallelujah my message i should have
[1:08:22] given this title before
[1:08:24] amen my message is
[1:08:26] from the word to the word
[1:08:30] we came from the word and we go back to
[1:08:32] the word
[1:08:33] and the word
[1:08:35] is god
[1:08:37] just bringing that and coming and seeing
[1:08:39] what god has done for us come on
[1:08:41] somebody you and i must understand that
[1:08:43] we have complete
[1:08:45] victory
[1:08:47] given to us did you hear what i say you
[1:08:49] don't have to work for it is given to
[1:08:51] you
[1:08:53] give one
[1:08:55] you say well how even the old testament
[1:08:58] saints do you think that they were
[1:09:00] perfect within themselves they were not
[1:09:03] but they believed on the one that was
[1:09:04] perfect
[1:09:06] and they died with that one that was
[1:09:08] perfect and because they believed that
[1:09:10] he was coming there was a resurrection
[1:09:12] for them
[1:09:14] hallelujah and you and i must understand
[1:09:17] that god has done a great thing you say
[1:09:19] what do you mean brother do you
[1:09:21] understand and this is what i'm trying
[1:09:22] to tell the people you know right now we
[1:09:24] say oh i'm just a church member i go to
[1:09:26] church i don't you understand it's more
[1:09:28] than that that's happening you're part
[1:09:30] of the resurrection
[1:09:32] you're the very vessels god is using
[1:09:35] amen after who's going to be translated
[1:09:37] except for those who really believe this
[1:09:40] word
[1:09:41] and have allowed it to be their handship
[1:09:46] you're already in it amen
[1:09:50] you say why would you say that well just
[1:09:53] like i said this morning
[1:09:55] when jesus rose from the dead
[1:09:57] he never did go back to the old churches
[1:10:01] he never talked no more with the
[1:10:03] pharisees and the sadducees
[1:10:05] they never did see him
[1:10:08] ever again
[1:10:10] laodicea will never see him again
[1:10:14] and what they're looking at now is an
[1:10:16] impostor
[1:10:19] but this bride he said in that day or at
[1:10:22] that day you'll know i am in the father
[1:10:25] the father's in me and i am in you
[1:10:28] that's where he's at
[1:10:30] he's in you and the more we allow him to
[1:10:34] uh uh uh unfold himself in us like i
[1:10:36] said this morning once eating the book
[1:10:38] the thunder now doesn't echo from heaven
[1:10:40] it echoes out of you
[1:10:43] it speaks from you
[1:10:46] you're the very virtue the very did not
[1:10:48] that
[1:10:49] divine nature of god
[1:10:52] in you
[1:10:54] as the bible says amen legion wasn't
[1:10:57] afraid
[1:10:58] of of
[1:11:00] jesus per se by flesh
[1:11:03] but he was afraid of the character
[1:11:06] that was in that body
[1:11:08] the devil is not afraid of you
[1:11:10] but that character
[1:11:12] that god-given character that jesus man
[1:11:16] that's on the inside that's what he's
[1:11:18] afraid of
[1:11:20] because he knows that that jesus is lord
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:25] so what did he do he's on the road to
[1:11:27] emmaus
[1:11:28] they're on the road the disciples there
[1:11:30] on the road to amaze and all of a sudden
[1:11:31] the seventh seal walk up
[1:11:34] the man who just rolled away the stone
[1:11:37] the one who was dead and now he's alive
[1:11:40] again
[1:11:42] huh he walks up
[1:11:44] and he walks up like a stranger
[1:11:47] they didn't even know who he was you
[1:11:50] understand me sometimes god gives you
[1:11:52] things and you don't even know where
[1:11:54] it's coming from and you don't even
[1:11:55] understand he's the one talking to you
[1:11:58] you think these thoughts just pops into
[1:12:00] your mind and god is talking to you
[1:12:02] because god projects his thoughts into
[1:12:05] your mind
[1:12:06] hallelujah let this mind be in you that
[1:12:09] was also in christ jesus so when god
[1:12:12] comes along he's talking to you you're
[1:12:14] reading the scriptures he's breaking the
[1:12:15] bread he you're reading oh my i've never
[1:12:17] seen that before do you think that's
[1:12:19] your intellect
[1:12:22] that's the invisible god speaking to you
[1:12:27] and on their way on their own wait on
[1:12:30] the uh times
[1:12:31] you know the bible said that jesus
[1:12:34] acted like he wasn't going any further
[1:12:36] and he says no
[1:12:37] come on stay with me stay with me and he
[1:12:39] does it still yet today
[1:12:43] how many times you felt him move away
[1:12:45] and you said no lord please stay with
[1:12:48] me oh yes sir what you know i know i
[1:12:53] enjoy sometimes i guess you say lord i
[1:12:55] enjoy that fellowship i enjoy and then
[1:12:58] when your presence is near me and
[1:13:00] whatever you do don't stop don't pull
[1:13:02] away and he'll do that just to hear you
[1:13:04] say that
[1:13:09] when they sat down there in the tent or
[1:13:11] in the inn or wherever they were
[1:13:14] with the conversation they had all of a
[1:13:16] sudden jesus break he breaks the bread
[1:13:20] and the bible said it was at that time
[1:13:23] their eyes were open
[1:13:25] well you know what people of god that's
[1:13:28] how you know
[1:13:29] you say well what do you mean brother
[1:13:30] brooks remember when that seal was
[1:13:33] broken
[1:13:34] jesus did what
[1:13:35] he didn't go declared uh
[1:13:38] jeremiah no he went through those books
[1:13:42] the old testament took the old testament
[1:13:45] and he preached
[1:13:46] jesus who was preaching jesus jesus was
[1:13:49] preaching jesus
[1:13:52] and he pulled all the way through and
[1:13:54] they saw it they understood that this
[1:13:57] same jesus christ he did not die
[1:14:01] just in vain but his death was already
[1:14:04] written in the word
[1:14:06] he opened their eyes to their
[1:14:08] understanding
[1:14:09] and according to luke 24 44 it said thus
[1:14:12] it is written and thus it be who christ
[1:14:14] to die and to suffer and deride on the
[1:14:16] from the dead on the third day that
[1:14:18] repentance and remission of sin should
[1:14:19] be preached in his name
[1:14:22] among all men beginning at jerusalem the
[1:14:24] bible said then open he their eyes to
[1:14:27] the scripture
[1:14:29] that they would understand that this
[1:14:30] same jesus god has made him lord in
[1:14:34] christ
[1:14:36] not two gods not three gods but one god
[1:14:40] and you know what because the book was
[1:14:42] open we don't understand do we i tell
[1:14:45] you what we are privileged people
[1:14:47] because we had a prophet
[1:14:49] and that prophet a man had the ability
[1:14:52] to go into the mind of god and come back
[1:14:55] with the true revelation of the word
[1:14:59] not just a preacher or a bishop that's
[1:15:01] going you know how we go you used to go
[1:15:03] to these bible studies and they said
[1:15:04] well i i think this mean that well you
[1:15:06] know this could mean this you see and
[1:15:09] the bible is not of any private
[1:15:11] interpretation god interprets his own
[1:15:14] word
[1:15:16] even if it's through a man that's what
[1:15:18] he does
[1:15:19] but he doesn't use theologians
[1:15:22] like that
[1:15:24] only a prophet
[1:15:27] you love the lord
[1:15:29] now coming to this place and i'm not
[1:15:31] going to be too much longer
[1:15:34] like i said earlier
[1:15:35] it's all
[1:15:36] through the bible
[1:15:38] that god conquered
[1:15:40] the whole world
[1:15:42] when he died on calvary
[1:15:44] and when he took the book out of the
[1:15:46] right hand of him that sounded on the
[1:15:48] throne when he took that book he took
[1:15:50] back the title deed right and then he
[1:15:53] gave it to john
[1:15:55] take the book
[1:15:56] john took the book are you john
[1:15:59] john was a type of the the bride of
[1:16:01] jesus christ
[1:16:02] right and so when you take the book what
[1:16:04] you're saying i now have the title
[1:16:07] deed
[1:16:08] that means i have the authority
[1:16:10] and everything that adam lost is now in
[1:16:13] my possession
[1:16:18] have you ever seen people try to put
[1:16:19] things together you know i'm not good at
[1:16:22] good at mechanically setting things
[1:16:23] together you know i'm you know i'm the
[1:16:25] kind of person you know i want to skip
[1:16:27] the direction and just figure it out in
[1:16:28] my mind
[1:16:29] worst thing you could do
[1:16:34] even though you might start out good
[1:16:35] something's going to go wrong because
[1:16:37] you did not read the directions and
[1:16:40] that's the way it goes with the word
[1:16:42] there's a certain way a place and you
[1:16:44] can't misplace it it's a certain way you
[1:16:46] place the word to make it work
[1:16:52] you can't just do it and you know what
[1:16:54] the truth of the matter is you can't
[1:16:56] just call think the word is going to
[1:16:58] work for you if your attitude is wrong
[1:17:01] if your motive and objective is wrong
[1:17:03] you can't use god like that
[1:17:06] y'all remember amen when peter and i
[1:17:09] think of james and john
[1:17:11] they were called sons of thunder
[1:17:13] lord send down the fire you know
[1:17:19] yo
[1:17:19] lord have mercy you know spoken word
[1:17:22] that's why god can't give it to us until
[1:17:24] we mature
[1:17:26] because our attitude is in trouble and
[1:17:29] jesus said unto them you don't know what
[1:17:30] you're asking
[1:17:32] because when elijah called down fire he
[1:17:34] was not in the right spirit that was not
[1:17:36] the holy ghost that made him do that
[1:17:39] when he when he said called call those
[1:17:41] bears to eat up those children that was
[1:17:43] a man an angry prophet
[1:17:46] you understand me but because he was a
[1:17:49] prophet god honored his words
[1:17:52] whoo
[1:17:53] isn't that amazing
[1:17:55] that's why you and i have to be careful
[1:17:57] what we speak
[1:17:58] he said always bless and curse not
[1:18:02] right
[1:18:03] you love the lord
[1:18:05] okay
[1:18:06] i'm so glad y'all so stirred up about
[1:18:08] the word y'all shouting out your seats
[1:18:10] and everything
[1:18:12] don't believe that
[1:18:24] oh my god god is good
[1:18:26] but we must understand that the whole
[1:18:28] purpose of god coming
[1:18:31] is to produce his own
[1:18:34] the world that we're getting ready to
[1:18:36] embrace
[1:18:37] will not have any serpents
[1:18:40] any evil
[1:18:41] no darkness
[1:18:43] this world that god is fixing up for us
[1:18:46] and doing for us amen is a world of
[1:18:48] holiness
[1:18:50] of his kind
[1:18:52] which adam the first adam was supposed
[1:18:54] to reproduce
[1:18:55] this is why
[1:18:56] as i said this morning those who are now
[1:18:59] standing in that sixth dimension you
[1:19:00] call it under the altar they are waiting
[1:19:04] for their glorified bodies they are now
[1:19:07] standing in their theophanies in their
[1:19:09] theophanies they don't eat nor drink nor
[1:19:11] sleep
[1:19:12] that's why if you hear an angelic choir
[1:19:15] singing they can hold a note forever
[1:19:18] because they don't have to breathe in to
[1:19:20] get more air
[1:19:22] see so that's the difference we have to
[1:19:26] hold and breathe and hold and breathe
[1:19:28] but they do not because they the life
[1:19:31] the breath of life was given to us on
[1:19:33] earth
[1:19:34] you understand me
[1:19:36] before the breath of life we were living
[1:19:39] right we were in our theophanies or
[1:19:42] adam was in this theophany he didn't
[1:19:44] need that but when he came into this
[1:19:46] dimension which is a limited dimension
[1:19:48] which is an animalistic or how he was
[1:19:50] three dimension he needed the breath of
[1:19:53] life so god
[1:19:55] breathed in the nostrils and he began to
[1:19:58] breathe he began to live
[1:20:00] so that he could feel taste smell and
[1:20:02] all those other kind of things that we
[1:20:04] do in this dimension which is there you
[1:20:07] don't have
[1:20:09] so they desire to come back to have an
[1:20:11] earthly body
[1:20:12] because that's what we were made for
[1:20:15] earth is our home
[1:20:17] heaven is just a vacation
[1:20:21] but we have been designed for the earth
[1:20:24] and god is going to bring us back to
[1:20:25] this earth to live somebody said the
[1:20:28] problem of god said you being believed
[1:20:30] that all these people that's died gonna
[1:20:33] be on this earth
[1:20:35] well
[1:20:36] prophet god said first of all god didn't
[1:20:38] say it like that
[1:20:40] but he said understand god has worlds on
[1:20:43] worlds suns and moons and stars
[1:20:46] he's got all of that we have no idea
[1:20:51] what's in store for us
[1:20:54] but i always will believe that this is
[1:20:58] headquarters this is where it starts but
[1:21:01] this is not where it ends
[1:21:03] you know scientists know something's out
[1:21:05] there or should be out there
[1:21:08] but just think about it jesus said if
[1:21:10] you be faithful into littles i will give
[1:21:13] you ruler to be the ruler over ten
[1:21:16] cities can you imagine every one of us
[1:21:21] ruling ten cities
[1:21:24] and god's cities are not small
[1:21:29] and if that be the case think about it
[1:21:32] how many worlds will we need
[1:21:34] i don't know but it's good to imagine
[1:21:40] it won't be cramped
[1:21:42] and it won't be overpopulated
[1:21:45] you won't have smog
[1:21:48] neither will you have fog
[1:21:52] it's going to be beautiful
[1:21:56] you love the lord i'm almost done
[1:21:58] with this portion i'm gonna keep chewing
[1:22:01] and chewing and chewing and chewing
[1:22:03] because we must understand that god is
[1:22:06] working on us to make sure that
[1:22:10] everything of this world
[1:22:13] is
[1:22:14] dead to us
[1:22:19] and we must in order for us to gain that
[1:22:21] victory we must say father not out my
[1:22:24] will but thine be done
[1:22:26] second corinthians 5 17 you don't have
[1:22:28] to
[1:22:29] turn he says therefore if any man be in
[1:22:32] christ
[1:22:33] he is a new creature
[1:22:36] old things are passed away
[1:22:38] and behold
[1:22:40] all things
[1:22:42] are become
[1:22:44] new
[1:22:45] showing there is a process there's
[1:22:46] something that goes on that brings these
[1:22:49] changes
[1:22:51] hallelujah
[1:22:53] you love the lord
[1:22:55] and to understand and i'm saying this
[1:22:58] galatians 6 15 says for in christ jesus
[1:23:02] neither circumcision availeth
[1:23:04] anything anything
[1:23:07] and
[1:23:08] uh
[1:23:09] nor uncircumcision that means you being
[1:23:12] a jew or gentile
[1:23:14] methodist baptist apostolic pentecost it
[1:23:17] does not matter but the only thing that
[1:23:18] matters to god is a new creature
[1:23:22] a new creation
[1:23:25] so from word to word and that's what
[1:23:27] we're doing that's what's happening now
[1:23:29] changing us
[1:23:30] what do you mean
[1:23:32] god
[1:23:33] chose us to be his partner
[1:23:38] that's dan
[1:23:40] we're going to read and go into
[1:23:43] uh
[1:23:48] our communion service
[1:23:57] am i the only one excited i don't know
[1:24:00] i am it may not look like it but i am
[1:24:04] inside of me there's a rejoicing
[1:24:07] i got friends that seem to be going on
[1:24:09] to
[1:24:10] before me and i can't hardly wait to see
[1:24:12] him again and
[1:24:13] you know it's just
[1:24:16] a time and i don't know how much father
[1:24:18] and how much longer my life will be
[1:24:20] extended on earth here
[1:24:22] but either way
[1:24:23] i just want to be make sure i'm ready i
[1:24:26] want to make sure i'm prepared
[1:24:28] to meet the lord and i i thank god for
[1:24:30] this message because
[1:24:32] everything i thought i knew i don't know
[1:24:34] i didn't know
[1:24:36] you know even in the denominations i
[1:24:37] didn't know you know that god i don't
[1:24:40] understand it other than election and
[1:24:42] predestination and the very fact he says
[1:24:44] come out of her my people he knew that
[1:24:47] we would be in that system all of us
[1:24:49] some way has been linked to some kind of
[1:24:51] harlot system and god said come out of
[1:24:54] her
[1:24:55] don't be partakers of her sin
[1:24:57] come out of her come to the word
[1:24:59] right
[1:25:00] this is the only age that we god calls
[1:25:04] evil
[1:25:05] this is an evil age or age of evil
[1:25:09] and you and i can see
[1:25:10] uh every from
[1:25:13] name it you name it name the places you
[1:25:16] can go uh that has power authority evil
[1:25:21] just just just just run by it
[1:25:24] and hear god chooses to take a bride out
[1:25:28] of
[1:25:28] such a place like this
[1:25:31] and only god can make us virtuous
[1:25:34] we can't do it on our own we we look at
[1:25:36] ourselves and we see such failures i do
[1:25:39] in christ alone
[1:25:42] do i give my glory
[1:25:44] he's the only one that i can depend on
[1:25:46] he's the only one that i could say yeah
[1:25:49] is worthy of all praise because as far
[1:25:52] as i'm concerned without him
[1:25:56] all of us will be lost
[1:25:58] but thank god because he's been rich in
[1:26:00] mercy that's the message you know god is
[1:26:03] rich in mercy
[1:26:05] as we stand we're actually to turn with
[1:26:07] us the first corinthians the
[1:26:10] 15th chapter i'm sorry 11th
[1:26:14] chapter
[1:26:15] we're going to start at 23rd verse
[1:26:19] we're going to work this and i'll read
[1:26:21] the scripture and then go prepare for
[1:26:24] communion
[1:26:27] i ask god musicians just to play
[1:26:29] something while i do so
[1:26:32] but as we read
[1:26:34] from the 11th chapter of
[1:26:37] first corinthians
[1:26:40] for i have received the lord that which
[1:26:42] also i delivered unto you that
[1:26:44] the lord jesus that same night in which
[1:26:47] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[1:26:50] had given thanks he break it and said
[1:26:52] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:26:54] for you
[1:26:55] this do in remembrance of me
[1:26:58] after the same manner also he took a cup
[1:27:02] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:27:03] the new testament in my blood
[1:27:06] this dewey as often as you drink it in
[1:27:08] remembrance of me
[1:27:10] for as often as you did eat this bread
[1:27:12] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:27:14] lord's death till he come
[1:27:16] wherefore whosoever eat shall eat this
[1:27:19] bread and drink this cup of the lord
[1:27:21] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:27:24] and blood of the lord but let a man
[1:27:26] examine himself and so let him eat up
[1:27:29] that bread and drink of that cup
[1:27:32] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:27:34] unworthily even drinketh damnation to
[1:27:36] himself not discerning the lord's body
[1:27:40] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:27:42] among you and many sleep
[1:27:44] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:27:46] should not be judged
[1:27:48] but when we are judged we are chasten of
[1:27:50] the lord
[1:27:51] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:27:54] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:27:57] come together to eat
[1:27:58] tarry one for another and if you demand
[1:28:01] hunger let them eat at home that ye come
[1:28:05] not together unto condemnation and the
[1:28:08] rest i will set in order
[1:28:11] when i come
[1:28:15] i want to drop a note to you
[1:28:21] laodicea was really rebuked
[1:28:24] that's where we most of us most of us
[1:28:26] started
[1:28:29] god gave us our invitation
[1:28:31] to come
[1:28:33] he said we'll be gold tried in the fire
[1:28:38] and only gold can answer
[1:28:41] to his call
[1:28:44] being that we are gold gold is a symbol
[1:28:46] of deity
[1:28:48] but god had to clean us up
[1:28:51] like he did at the woman at the well
[1:28:53] deity
[1:28:55] christ in them everybody that received
[1:28:57] the holy ghost
[1:28:59] is transformed
[1:29:00] from an old creature to a new creature
[1:29:02] so much so that god shares his deity
[1:29:05] with you
[1:29:06] and it's not you that's deity but it's
[1:29:09] the god that's in you that's deity
[1:29:12] and so here we are great pieces of bread
[1:29:15] broken
[1:29:17] and god said these fragments are
[1:29:20] his body
[1:29:22] one day these fragments will be placed
[1:29:24] together and put together like the city
[1:29:26] of of jerusalem coming down from heaven
[1:29:29] different stones from different places
[1:29:31] different people from different places
[1:29:34] we all have been different we are
[1:29:36] different but yet and still we have one
[1:29:38] thing in common and that's christ
[1:29:40] and once we
[1:29:42] have christ on the inside of us god
[1:29:44] liken us as living stones
[1:29:48] living stones that are
[1:29:50] united by the holy spirit
[1:29:52] that's what we are people
[1:29:54] we are who we are and once we come to
[1:29:57] see we are bride and stop thinking about
[1:30:00] what you used to do what you was and you
[1:30:02] know
[1:30:04] let the holy spirit wash all of that
[1:30:06] away from you
[1:30:08] because that was not you you're a new
[1:30:10] creature now once christ is in you
[1:30:12] you're new that's the old man
[1:30:15] and uh so what we need to do is separate
[1:30:17] those thoughts from the thoughts of god
[1:30:19] think
[1:30:20] the way god would think
[1:30:22] and this will get us through
[1:30:25] these
[1:30:26] times of trials
[1:30:28] but we this is a beautiful situation to
[1:30:30] me
[1:30:31] i'm really enjoying myself probably as a
[1:30:33] christian more now than i ever have
[1:30:36] in spite of all the obstacles there's
[1:30:38] something that's really just leaping for
[1:30:40] joy on the inside because i know in just
[1:30:43] a matter of time
[1:30:45] we'll be changed
[1:30:48] so as i go and prepare myself we're just
[1:30:50] going to sing a little song
[1:30:52] anymore play a song
[1:30:55] either my faith will go
[1:30:59] so
