[39:43] every one of us
[39:48] from the beginning of the year till now
[39:52] i believe that it's a particular grace
[39:54] that god has granted to us
[39:57] [Music]
[40:00] some are in the sickbed
[40:04] some found themselves in prisons
[40:09] they were
[40:10] prevented from their liberty
[40:14] some died passed away
[40:22] and if we can just look back
[40:25] we're going to see that it was the grace
[40:27] of god
[40:31] maybe you were not maybe we were not the
[40:33] best person that exists on earth
[40:38] maybe we did not live the word fully as
[40:40] we should ask
[40:43] but did not look at that
[40:46] he gave us life
[40:49] without price
[41:07] [Music]
[41:28] [Music]
[41:32] holding him along and i want you lord to
[41:34] place your word in my in my tongue
[41:40] and that you move me out of the way
[41:44] and that your place and your presence in
[42:00] it leaves this place right now
[42:03] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[42:07] and we we cast it out from this place
[42:12] and we want the holy spirit to dominate
[42:14] us in this
[42:24] [Music]
[42:45] in the name of jesus christ our god amen
[42:47] amen
[42:53] we're standing we're going to read the
[42:54] holy scriptures
[42:56] and samuel
[43:00] we're going to read in the book of
[43:02] first samuel chapter 16
[43:04] from verse 1 to 14.
[43:10] we're going to read this
[43:13] first samuel chapter 16 from verse 1 to
[43:16] 14.
[43:17] okay
[43:23] and the lord said unto samuel
[43:35] [Music]
[43:55] provided for i have provided me a king
[43:58] among his sons
[44:05] if so hear it he will kill me
[44:18] i am come to sacrifice to the lord
[44:32] i will show thee what thou shalt do
[44:49] and the elders of the town tremble that
[44:51] is coming and said cometh that peace
[44:53] only
[44:55] happened
[44:59] and said cometh that peaceably and he
[45:00] said possibly i come to sacrifice unto
[45:03] the lord sanctified
[45:07] sacrifice
[45:12] sanctify yourselves and come with me to
[45:15] the sacrifice and he sacrificed jesse
[45:17] and his sons and called call them to the
[45:20] sacrifices
[45:30] and it came to pass when they were come
[45:31] that he looked on eliab and said surely
[45:34] the lord and the lord's anointed is
[45:37] before it beforehand
[45:46] but the lord said unto samuel look not
[45:48] onto his countenance on the heights of
[45:50] his stature because i have refused them.
[45:56] the lord does not look
[45:58] on what
[46:05] the lord seeth not amen what man seemed
[46:07] for man looketh unto on the outward
[46:10] appearance but the lord looketh on the
[46:11] heart is
[46:26] and he said neither has the lord chosen
[46:28] this
[46:34] then then
[46:36] then jesus made shama to pass by and he
[46:38] said neither has the lord chosen this is
[46:48] again jesse made seven of his sons to
[46:50] pass before samuel and samuel said unto
[46:53] jesus
[46:54] the lord has not chosen these
[46:58] songs
[47:05] and samuel said out to jess they are or
[47:07] hear all thy children and he said there
[47:09] remaineth yet the youngest and behold he
[47:13] keepeth the sheep
[47:20] and samuel said unto jesus send and
[47:23] fetch him for we will not sit down till
[47:25] he come either
[47:29] and he sent and brought him now he was
[47:31] ready
[47:35] with all of the beautiful countenances
[47:42] and the lord said arise anoint him for
[47:44] this is he samuel
[47:48] um
[47:49] then samuel took the orange oil
[47:59] and the spirit of the lord came upon
[48:01] david from that day forward so so samuel
[48:04] rose up and went to rama esprit de la
[48:07] tunnel
[48:13] but the spirit of the lord departed from
[48:15] soul and an evil spirits from the lord
[48:46] in my prayer to you okay
[48:50] man
[48:50] to remove every thoughts of man
[48:57] and that only the thoughts of the father
[49:00] remain
[49:05] so that you may give the gift of life to
[49:07] your children
[49:09] as soon as we surrender in your word
[49:12] in the name of jesus christ amen amen
[49:19] this morning i'm going to title my
[49:20] little subject
[49:23] david and the the the anointing of the
[49:26] king
[49:29] first
[49:31] i wanted to say something
[49:43] first i want to say something but i i
[49:46] don't know if it's going to be
[49:47] understood the way i want it to be
[49:48] understood
[49:53] i'm going to put this aside
[49:55] i want to say this
[50:23] but it's the word of god
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] he says that when the preacher is
[50:55] everyone has to be silent so that the
[50:57] preacher can be heard
[51:02] now this is the word of god that's being
[51:04] being proclaimed
[51:06] if he's preaching under the anointing
[51:09] spread the prophet's son to me or
[51:10] prophet then every spirit of the prophet
[51:12] is subject to the prophet
[51:17] when a pastor walks to the black
[51:19] platform turns the bible along
[52:01] and you can preach
[52:17] you're wondering if the people that are
[52:19] listening to you are understanding what
[52:21] you're saying
[52:26] i've seen brother brooks say brother
[52:28] brooks say sometimes how are you looking
[52:29] at staring at me like that as if i'm
[52:31] lying to you
[52:34] on paper no but when you stand here you
[52:36] cannot lie
[52:41] we're waiting on god
[52:43] [Music]
[52:44] and and when you come here you also have
[52:48] to be expecting from god to speak
[52:51] and when you come together
[52:54] brother rhyme says we come here to get
[52:56] better the power of pleasure
[53:27] and his servants are waiting on him to
[53:29] bring the word for him
[53:33] so when you see the word of god being
[53:35] preached
[53:36] you can say amen
[53:40] you can say it as the
[54:08] then you're gonna then you're going to
[54:10] say then you're going to say that he's
[54:12] he's talking about me
[54:21] i'm wondering if we're still those
[54:22] spiritual christians that
[54:24] that wait
[54:25] to hear from the spirit
[54:30] now it's a tradition
[54:32] that people come to church
[54:47] now you think that people are waiting to
[54:49] understand what's being said but they're
[54:52] they're actually waiting to understand
[54:57] when you come with such attitude you're
[54:59] not going to be
[55:00] what gratitude
[55:02] because your attitude toward god is not
[55:04] good
[55:39] is that even when the person that's
[55:41] preaching doesn't know your personal
[55:43] issues
[55:49] spoke to the preacher to speak about
[55:52] with the problem that's happening
[55:55] now you're just going to be saying that
[55:57] oh he's just talking about me
[56:00] and
[56:13] those who are perfect don't live with us
[56:15] here on earth
[56:19] those the gods sought perfect he took
[56:21] them out from the earth
[56:22] do you understand
[56:24] those who aren't
[56:26] god took them out from the earth
[56:41] standing here i have i have mistakes
[56:48] no you also have your faults
[56:58] but when you come here you have to
[56:59] expect that the word of god either
[57:01] blesses you or comforts you
[57:06] fine maybe water
[57:08] yeah
[57:09] mercedes
[57:24] i also saw that there are new faces
[57:25] among us here
[57:27] we all bless you in the name of our lord
[57:29] jesus christ
[57:33] we are this is your church here
[57:51] was just to prepare your spirit so that
[57:53] you feel well
[57:55] and not a pastor
[58:00] because the preacher can come from any
[58:02] place not knowing your problem
[58:06] when he's gonna
[58:21] but it could be that the holy spirit
[58:22] spoke to you through that preacher that
[58:24] lives with you
[58:26] hello
[58:28] now listen
[58:33] we read with you in the book of samuel
[58:35] uh
[58:41] and i told you that i'm titling the
[58:43] subject david and the royal anointing
[58:48] and if you noticed well ivanka david saw
[58:50] when the launch
[58:52] before david was anointed by the royal
[58:54] anointing
[58:59] david did not do anything to to
[59:02] to be worthy of that anointing
[59:09] david did not do anything to be worthy
[59:12] of that anointing
[59:15] it was just the grace of god
[59:22] and god said that they were not the ones
[59:24] that were chosen
[59:27] david was the one that was chosen
[59:44] israel before
[59:47] he was still king
[59:51] but he was already rejected from god
[1:00:00] was rejected by god because he did
[1:00:02] something that did not please the lord
[1:00:06] the bible said that god told tonight
[1:00:09] that through the mouth of my prophetic
[1:00:53] just like the soldiers came
[1:00:56] god was not pleased with it
[1:01:01] because they were bringing
[1:01:04] foreign
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:34] listen to this my brothers and sisters
[1:01:48] not after that
[1:01:49] prophecy
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:11] just because the person doesn't follow
[1:02:13] god anymore we must find myself yes my
[1:02:15] brothers and sisters
[1:02:18] god predestinated
[1:02:32] he will choose
[1:02:45] yes the program of god cannot stop
[1:02:47] because of one person
[1:02:50] god will always have someone to raise
[1:02:53] an economy because in the economy
[1:02:57] he never missed witnesses
[1:03:12] it did not depend on the appearance of
[1:03:14] the person
[1:03:17] was a good a good man
[1:03:21] but he was rejected
[1:03:26] and when saul when samuel came to
[1:03:28] another
[1:04:09] but the choice of god was somewhere in
[1:04:11] the woods
[1:04:14] he was there with the sheep
[1:04:17] he was there with the pastors
[1:04:21] god took him from the past
[1:04:24] he
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:07] get your son because you are his choice
[1:05:11] it doesn't depend on the appearance
[1:05:13] it doesn't depend on the height
[1:05:17] but it depends on the grace of god
[1:05:19] that's on you
[1:05:34] that he was anointed among his brothers
[1:05:39] no god will not raise you up somewhere
[1:05:41] else
[1:05:43] he will raise you up among your brothers
[1:05:48] the anointing that you will get from god
[1:05:51] will be among your brothers
[1:05:54] yes my brothers and sisters
[1:05:57] david was the one that was the most
[1:05:59] neglected
[1:06:00] he was neglected even from his father
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:23] [Applause]
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:43] people that are neglected
[1:06:57] god can place his hand on
[1:07:12] god does not count on things like that
[1:07:16] but god counts on people that are
[1:07:18] neglected
[1:07:20] people that don't have importance
[1:07:24] those are the people that got counted
[1:07:26] those are the people that got god count
[1:07:28] on we said
[1:07:30] yes it's true my brothers
[1:07:33] here
[1:07:37] oh we're children of uh
[1:07:51] but there was one person that had the
[1:07:52] grace of god
[1:07:54] and it was david remember
[1:07:57] that's why the same david said
[1:08:00] when the spirit of god called us later
[1:08:04] he said blessed are those
[1:08:08] in
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:19] no matter what sin you do say to your
[1:08:22] cornea
[1:08:26] [Applause]
[1:08:32] i want you this morning to understand
[1:08:34] that you are the choice
[1:08:48] is whom the lord does not impute sin
[1:08:53] the grace of god is different
[1:08:58] it was different with david and his
[1:09:00] brothers
[1:09:04] the children of david's father were all
[1:09:06] children of david's father
[1:09:09] david was also children
[1:09:15] but the grace of god was granted to them
[1:09:17] in a different way
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:32] i want you
[1:09:46] among
[1:09:52] you always have this one child that you
[1:09:53] consider the most and that you love the
[1:09:55] most
[1:09:57] parents will not tell you that among all
[1:09:59] the all of you
[1:10:07] there's always this child among everyone
[1:10:09] that's loved among everyone
[1:10:14] it's the nature
[1:10:26] that's why when he grants his grace
[1:10:57] like she liked to spank me
[1:11:01] and sometimes she respect me
[1:11:03] then i wouldn't cry anymore
[1:11:06] now she saw she thought that i became
[1:11:09] weird
[1:11:15] i remember she took my hand one day and
[1:11:17] hit it against the wall
[1:11:20] and now i i started crying because she
[1:11:22] wanted me to cry when she spanked me
[1:11:30] and i also wanted to show her that even
[1:11:32] that every that everything she was doing
[1:11:34] to spank me to make me cry we're not
[1:11:36] going to make me cry
[1:11:38] but now i want
[1:11:43] he has some he has children and he has
[1:11:45] prevail children that are privileged
[1:11:49] now it can hurt you
[1:11:52] but what i'm saying is the truth
[1:11:54] now david
[1:11:58] was the son of jesus
[1:12:03] but god said that it was a man according
[1:12:05] to his own heart
[1:12:09] god has never said this for anybody
[1:12:11] anybody else
[1:12:15] but he said for david that that was a
[1:12:17] man according to my own heart
[1:12:20] what
[1:12:24] so that god could say that david was a
[1:12:27] man according to his own heart
[1:12:29] he didn't do anything
[1:12:31] it was just the grace of god
[1:12:36] that's why i say that god gives us his
[1:12:38] grace differently for everybody
[1:12:40] yes my brothers and sisters
[1:12:43] now in the garden of god
[1:12:46] because god does his grace differently
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:26] so
[1:14:37] now this one god can give him a big
[1:14:39] mistake
[1:14:54] yes
[1:15:21] the great warrior david in 1955.
[1:15:25] he says paragraph 55.
[1:15:30] notice the david was called by election
[1:15:34] he was elected
[1:15:36] first
[1:16:28] because nothing was found against joseph
[1:16:33] all right david was called if you feel
[1:16:35] my number dude and brother brother says
[1:16:39] david
[1:16:42] elected first by god
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:17:29] exactly
[1:17:30] that's where we are
[1:17:32] that's what brother brethren says
[1:17:35] are you a david
[1:17:36] david because of david
[1:17:39] is the type of the believer
[1:17:41] david
[1:17:56] you are david
[1:17:59] and because you are a david
[1:18:01] the lord hasn't as he elected you
[1:18:04] because the bible tells us
[1:18:06] that he elected us before the foundation
[1:18:09] of the lord exists
[1:18:24] now he
[1:18:51] you're not a christian by your own
[1:18:53] desires
[1:18:55] we are christian by god's desire
[1:18:59] because he said no man come true
[1:19:03] except my father draws
[1:19:05] first
[1:19:48] what
[1:19:55] [Applause]
[1:20:01] he's baptized in with the holy ghost is
[1:20:03] from assembly in a symbol form
[1:20:11] now that you understand
[1:20:14] that you're not a christian by your
[1:20:16] desires
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:21:02] [Applause]
[1:21:37] i believe that something will happen
[1:21:40] too i believe with
[1:22:04] now listen to what god says of david hey
[1:22:07] let's play
[1:22:35] god had those people that he loved in
[1:22:38] that person
[1:22:39] but david is not islam
[1:22:42] but he is the beloved
[1:22:45] the man according to god's will
[1:22:48] now listen
[1:22:50] and he said
[1:23:04] david my servants
[1:23:07] with my holy my only hoyle i have
[1:23:10] anointed him
[1:23:12] my hand
[1:23:14] my arm shall strengthen him
[1:23:18] and my arm shall strengthen him
[1:23:22] the enemy shall not surprise him
[1:23:26] and the enemy shall not shall not uh
[1:23:32] afflict him
[1:23:36] i won't beat dallas foreign is before
[1:23:39] his face
[1:23:42] and i won't beat down those that hate
[1:23:43] him
[1:23:46] my my faithfulness and mercy shall be
[1:23:49] with you
[1:23:52] and his strength shall be shall be exact
[1:23:57] i want you to understand this
[1:24:00] that's
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:27] he's not alone
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:10] yes
[1:25:38] how many times did soul traps try to
[1:25:40] hurt david met that fear there's some
[1:25:42] problem but what was the problem
[1:25:46] because he was the beloved of god
[1:25:49] he left everything he surrendered
[1:25:51] everything
[1:26:19] he was angry because of that
[1:26:32] your hatred will not do anything
[1:26:45] and you can't hurt god
[1:26:48] david
[1:27:16] there down there
[1:27:18] then he cried soul soul
[1:27:24] is trying to hurt me every time
[1:27:27] while i didn't do anything to you
[1:27:29] voila
[1:27:54] david said i will not want to hurt an
[1:27:56] anointed of god
[1:29:21] the heart of david
[1:29:24] was the heart that he needed
[1:29:32] no matter what how how david appeared to
[1:29:34] be
[1:29:37] [Applause]
[1:30:04] david was the little man
[1:30:06] but the bible told us
[1:30:08] that he had good beautiful eyes
[1:30:11] that he had a good uh appearance
[1:30:14] he was the choice
[1:30:17] because he was the man according to go
[1:30:19] to god's heart
[1:30:20] myself yes my brothers and sisters
[1:30:24] now listen to what brother says
[1:30:32] god saw the heart of david pettit
[1:30:36] preached in 1958
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:41] as i'm giving this because they're
[1:30:43] projecting it on this one
[1:30:46] so that those who can read can read
[1:30:47] along
[1:30:49] now listen to this
[1:30:52] but david showed what he was looking for
[1:30:56] not in the outside appearance
[1:30:59] but inside a man
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:28] that's what
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:42] david
[1:31:56] believer he's a type of the christian
[1:32:01] in his last days
[1:32:04] in which we're living
[1:32:06] because you are also a david
[1:32:10] god also
[1:32:39] [Applause]
[1:32:53] [Applause]
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:33] in his last days
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:59] [Applause]
[1:34:05] on earth
[1:34:08] god heard their prayers
[1:34:11] and that's why in 1909.
[1:34:14] god answered to that prayer
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:30] are you a son of god too
[1:34:32] then brother branham is the son of god
[1:34:34] too
[1:34:36] but that son
[1:34:38] is the holy ghost it is the lord jesus

[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:22] brother
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:51] the the the the the um
[1:36:53] the wound was infected
[1:36:57] and brother branham says
[1:36:59] now when god spoke to him
[1:37:02] he said lord
[1:37:03] be burnt happy but
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:38:56] because i have david's of god this

[1:39:00] he said don't consider what men have
[1:39:02] said almighty if men said they showed
[1:39:05] them miracles but the days of miracles
[1:39:07] are passed
[1:39:09] the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't
[1:39:10] exist

[1:39:14] that peter says
[1:39:16] in the day of pentecost
[1:39:19] but the promise is for you and for your
[1:39:20] children
[1:39:22] and for all those that are far off we
[1:39:24] may profess that and yes my brothers
[1:39:26] brother says
[1:39:32] god has promised that those things will
[1:39:34] happen in the last days

[1:40:42] [Applause]
[1:40:48] god in his last days
[1:40:50] and the gift of healing
[1:40:53] was right right there for confirmation
[1:40:56] to vindicate again
