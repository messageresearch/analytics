[46:06] lay quietly
[46:10] the spirit of

[46:15] overshadowed her
[46:20] and said that you'll conceive a child
[46:26] that sin cannot
[46:28] be fallen she said be it unto me
[46:35] according to thy word
[46:40] and she kept these things
[46:45] and pondered them
[46:48] deep within her heart

[51:01] we love the lord
[51:03] and we're all oppressing
[51:06] i trust that we are
[51:09] this is the hour of pressing
[51:13] the bible says when the enemy comes in
[51:15] like a flood
[51:17] the spirit of the lord
[51:20] lifts up a standard
[51:23] he lifts it up
[51:26] not us now we ourselves he
[51:28] lifts it up
[51:30] we live in a time where
[51:34] people's people have their rights
[51:38] people do
[51:40] as they choose to do
[51:44] but
[51:44] we have become
[51:47] prisoners of christ
[51:51] willfully
[51:52] amen we become
[51:55] prisoners of christ because we know what
[51:59] we can do with our lives
[52:02] and we need his leadership
[52:05] we need his direction now
[52:07] we definitely need
[52:09] his life
[52:11] and uh you know i'm so grateful
[52:14] uh to the lord
[52:16] for all that he's done and in his doing
[52:19] and will do
[52:21] um
[52:22] so let us turn to the word of god
[52:26] uh according to ruth
[52:30] we're gonna go to the third chapter
[52:31] there
[52:33] uh i believe that in that book
[52:37] uh god has something for us
[52:40] i'm not going to just preach on that
[52:42] particular book
[52:44] but but i want to start out with some
[52:46] thoughts from it
[52:49] uh so that we can come to see where
[52:52] god has us
[52:54] in in the lord
[52:57] ruth the third
[52:58] chapter and we'll read a couple of
[53:01] verses from there
[53:03] and then we'll go to revelations the
[53:05] third chapter
[53:09] i preached somewhat some of this in iowa
[53:12] city but this is more like a part two
[53:17] and i'll try to
[53:19] bring it all together so that we can see
[53:22] basically what god is doing with us and
[53:25] for us
[53:28] everybody there
[53:30] ruth third chapter we again read the
[53:33] ninth verse
[53:35] and he said who art thou
[53:38] and she answered i am
[53:40] ruth thine handmaid
[53:44] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[53:46] handmaid
[53:48] for thou art a near kinsmen
[53:52] the eleventh verse and now my daughter
[53:55] fear not
[53:56] i will do to thee all that thou
[53:59] requirest
[54:00] for all the city of my people doth know
[54:04] thou art a virtuous woman
[54:08] 14th and 15th verses
[54:11] and she laid at his feet until the
[54:13] morning
[54:14] and she rose up before one could know
[54:17] another
[54:19] and he said let it not be known
[54:22] that a woman came into the floor
[54:26] also he said bring the veil that thou
[54:29] has upon thee and hold it
[54:32] and when she held it
[54:35] he measured six measures of bali
[54:38] and laid it on her
[54:40] and she went into
[54:42] the city

[56:55] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[56:59] i think that's too loud
[57:04] we've got a i guess a system we're
[57:06] trying to work all of the the uh
[57:11] quirks out of it
[57:13] um
[57:14] but that level wherever you are can you
[57:16] hear me it sounds real good to me so
[57:19] we praise the lord for that
[57:23] you know i i've been really uh
[57:26] personally going through
[57:29] a lot of things
[57:31] um
[57:33] but all of the things that i've been
[57:34] going through has it's really been good
[57:36] for me
[57:38] and i realized by god's grace that
[57:40] everything is orchestrated by god
[57:44] there is not a moment or second
[57:46] in my life that he's not there amen
[57:49] often time we fail to see what he is
[57:52] and what he's doing
[57:54] uh because our minds are like bird
[57:57] brains compared to his
[57:59] the intelligence of god supersedes us
[58:02] trillions and trillions of whatever
[58:06] uh you know it's not something that you
[58:08] can literally grasp with his own mind
[58:12] when we get to heaven even when we get
[58:13] to heaven we're still
[58:15] you know
[58:17] feel so unworthy to be in his presence
[58:20] even with the knowledge of what he's
[58:22] done for us
[58:23] here on earth
[58:26] and you know i i think about
[58:29] the prophet of god when he says that
[58:32] right now we are in a place of of an
[58:35] open door
[58:36] of the word and power
[58:39] he didn't say of the open door of the
[58:41] word but he said of the word and power
[58:45] and
[58:46] we we just need to know
[58:49] uh basically
[58:50] what that means
[58:52] uh what does it mean
[58:54] when we think about every age every age
[58:57] had a door opened
[58:59] and that age also had a door of
[59:03] and closing
[59:03] from ephesus all the way up to this age
[59:06] we see by god's grace that in the lay of
[59:09] the sea and age
[59:10] uh we we say well it's not over but in
[59:13] reality they've been rejected
[59:15] so it's over
[59:17] uh there are but what we're now in in
[59:20] this day and time is is the gathering
[59:23] amen remember jesus talk about gary
[59:26] gathering the wheat and gathering the
[59:28] tear
[59:29] and so this is where we are it's the
[59:31] gathering of the wheat and the tear and
[59:34] the tares are being bundled together by
[59:36] way of organizations and
[59:37] denominationalism
[59:40] but the bride of jesus christ or the
[59:42] wheat she's being gathered into his bond
[59:46] she's gone she's being gathered into a
[59:48] place of safety
[59:50] uh when we think about an open door
[59:54] we know we read that in revelations the
[59:56] third chapter
[59:57] and we understand about brother branham
[59:59] said it wasn't knocking on the
[1:00:00] individual door he was literally
[1:00:02] knocking on the church age store trying
[1:00:05] to get into the church because it was
[1:00:07] the church that put him out that's right
[1:00:09] and understand what he is he is the word
[1:00:12] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:00:13] was with god
[1:00:14] but they adopted creeds and dogmas they
[1:00:17] they thought their traditions they
[1:00:20] placed their traditions above the word
[1:00:22] of god
[1:00:23] and uh we we can go all the way back
[1:00:26] into the age of ephesus where paul spoke
[1:00:29] of these things happening he talked
[1:00:31] about the antichrist and he talked about
[1:00:33] men you know making themselves higher
[1:00:36] persons than others and hierarchies and
[1:00:38] things of that nature and even when they
[1:00:41] uh in paul's day they they said they had
[1:00:45] already started grouping off some of
[1:00:47] cephas and some of apollos and all of
[1:00:49] these kind of things and paul rebuked
[1:00:51] that spirit and told him that it wasn't
[1:00:53] of god
[1:00:54] uh that uh he said not even when you
[1:00:56] call yourself my disciples basically
[1:00:59] because listen i didn't die for you
[1:01:01] that's right
[1:01:02] and uh he was saying there's no division
[1:01:04] among the body
[1:01:06] uh the body is one
[1:01:08] now if we look at that being
[1:01:13] where the seeds were planted
[1:01:15] we can come all the way up through all
[1:01:17] the ages and no matter
[1:01:19] how much revelation god would break open
[1:01:22] to them
[1:01:23] eventually they would all
[1:01:25] um denominate
[1:01:27] and separate uh wesley and and luther
[1:01:31] and you know you name it they always had
[1:01:33] the first baptist the second baptist the
[1:01:35] third and and you wonder you know really
[1:01:37] which one was the first you know but
[1:01:40] they have grouped themselves in such a
[1:01:42] way and all of those things are
[1:01:44] antichrist they're not christ
[1:01:47] the bible says by by one spirit we're
[1:01:49] baptized into one body
[1:01:52] amen we are blessed
[1:01:54] in this day because at the time god was
[1:01:57] closing to the door to
[1:01:59] a lay of the sea of god was opening
[1:02:01] under a door to the bride
[1:02:03] uh you know even in the book of
[1:02:05] revelation when he talks about come out
[1:02:07] of her my people and be not partakers of
[1:02:09] her sin he tells us that everybody
[1:02:12] that's left in that system a way of
[1:02:15] worship will be cursed with her and
[1:02:17] would received of her plagues and so it
[1:02:20] doesn't matter he said brother brooks
[1:02:21] where do you go you go to the word or
[1:02:24] you find a place that's preaching the
[1:02:26] word you find a place amen that that
[1:02:28] stands on the word for today amen i mean
[1:02:31] you got people who don't believe in
[1:02:33] healings and deliverances and you got
[1:02:35] people who don't believe in prophets but
[1:02:37] we don't need a prophet uh nowadays but
[1:02:40] let me say it like this that's not what
[1:02:42] jesus said amen
[1:02:44] because he said that in the last days he
[1:02:46] said you know
[1:02:48] you know it talks about the revealing of
[1:02:49] the son of man and if you understand
[1:02:52] what the son of man is the son of man is
[1:02:53] a prophet amen
[1:02:56] hallelujah but let's go on we come back
[1:02:59] to let's jump backwards and come to
[1:03:01] where we read about ruth
[1:03:04] one of the things that i i wanted to to
[1:03:06] to to come out of ruth was
[1:03:09] you know boaz faithfulness and boyz was
[1:03:12] a a type of of god in here amen and ruth
[1:03:15] was the type of the bride
[1:03:17] and and and boy says well we we're going
[1:03:20] to fix this
[1:03:22] one of the things that i love about ruth
[1:03:24] is because she broke all protocol
[1:03:27] she did not
[1:03:28] introduce herself in what we call the
[1:03:31] proper way
[1:03:32] but she stole away at night kind of like
[1:03:34] what nicodemus did you know
[1:03:37] she stole away at night uh
[1:03:39] under the leadership and guidance of her
[1:03:42] mother-in-law amen uh which which was
[1:03:44] wonderful because you understand that
[1:03:46] this ruth types out the gentile bride
[1:03:50] and the gentile bride was under the
[1:03:51] instruction of the old church
[1:03:54] why because jesus christ is the same
[1:03:56] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:58] and so when when boaz awakened and finds
[1:04:01] ruth there in his place of the floor
[1:04:05] uh she says unto him you know
[1:04:08] basically cover me
[1:04:10] oh i love that
[1:04:11] i cover me with your garment in other
[1:04:13] words i'm i'm yours i need you to own me
[1:04:17] you understand me she was literally
[1:04:19] giving herself to a man of age
[1:04:23] not a young man because remember you
[1:04:26] know it really struck boaz in such a way
[1:04:28] he says listen i'm an old man
[1:04:31] you got young men out here rich or poor
[1:04:33] you could have been you're a beautiful
[1:04:34] woman you could easily have gone that
[1:04:36] way
[1:04:37] but you see
[1:04:39] it wasn't predestinated that's not what
[1:04:41] god wanted that's not what was the
[1:04:43] intent the intent was that ruth
[1:04:46] though she'd be a moabitest
[1:04:48] was ordained by god
[1:04:51] uh to carry on the seed of god
[1:04:54] by way of of a boy ass
[1:04:57] and
[1:04:57] and the thing that i love about it
[1:04:59] because you know there was kinsmen
[1:05:00] redeemer we know about those things
[1:05:02] we've heard about how you know there was
[1:05:05] a next of kin which is the flesh
[1:05:08] that old man he
[1:05:10] represented the flesh
[1:05:11] and he had a right to us
[1:05:14] but he didn't want us
[1:05:16] he did not want ruth
[1:05:18] and and and boy says listen
[1:05:21] if he doesn't take you i'll take you
[1:05:24] that was the whole scheme of the thing
[1:05:26] amen because we know the devil don't
[1:05:28] mind messing you up
[1:05:30] but he don't want you
[1:05:32] reason being because he knows there's a
[1:05:34] righteous seed in you
[1:05:37] hallelujah and so we go on to that the
[1:05:40] thing that i
[1:05:41] i
[1:05:42] love about this story and i was talking
[1:05:44] to a brother about it today i said ruth
[1:05:49] rested
[1:05:51] upon boaz
[1:05:53] faithfulness
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:58] he had already known and this is the
[1:05:59] thing i love about her is because boaz
[1:06:01] says listen your reputation has already
[1:06:04] gone out
[1:06:06] all of
[1:06:07] jerusalem all of the people know
[1:06:10] that you are
[1:06:12] a virtuous woman
[1:06:13] see
[1:06:14] this church called ruth
[1:06:17] had such a reputation
[1:06:19] that even the sinners had to acknowledge
[1:06:21] her
[1:06:22] and that ought to make us understand we
[1:06:24] can't just live any kind of way and
[1:06:27] expect to be called ruth
[1:06:32] now
[1:06:33] we're living in a time where the word of
[1:06:35] god has been opened
[1:06:37] i thank god for his faithfulness
[1:06:40] i was working on i'm still working on
[1:06:41] the message on that resting in his
[1:06:43] faithfulness but i'll kind of jump in
[1:06:45] there to a little bit because we must
[1:06:47] understand that god wants us to rest
[1:06:51] amen in his faithfulness
[1:06:53] ruth has already made her hearts cry
[1:06:56] to boaz
[1:06:58] and boy has accepted her heart's cry
[1:07:01] and he promised her
[1:07:03] because of her heart's cry
[1:07:06] i'm gonna fix it
[1:07:08] what i need you to do is go back
[1:07:10] and and rest
[1:07:12] and what did he do he gave her uh bali
[1:07:15] uh six volleys in in her veil you know
[1:07:18] just to show her it was like a total
[1:07:21] engagement
[1:07:23] she he was welcoming her by giving her
[1:07:26] those that substance of life
[1:07:30] and i say all of these things because
[1:07:32] even in all of these messages we can see
[1:07:35] by god's grace that the promise of god
[1:07:38] is yea and not nay
[1:07:40] and sometimes we fail within ourselves
[1:07:43] because we really want to make it happen
[1:07:46] and you can't
[1:07:48] you and i must understand that what
[1:07:50] makes things happen with us is when we
[1:07:52] have faith that's right in the faith
[1:07:57] not faith in us faith
[1:07:59] in the faithful
[1:08:02] and and and then revelation comes along
[1:08:04] he says listen i found you in a mess
[1:08:07] you know more biters right hybrid
[1:08:10] religion right that's exactly what ruth
[1:08:13] represented and when god came to
[1:08:15] laodicea everything was hybrid amen
[1:08:18] and god had to bring back the original
[1:08:20] seed by a word of a prophet amen thank
[1:08:24] you but everybody was like ruth that's
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:28] and you and i must understand that god
[1:08:30] is expecting us
[1:08:32] to make a move
[1:08:34] amen
[1:08:35] he knows who you are but you must come
[1:08:38] to know who you are
[1:08:41] now
[1:08:44] you and i must understand we've been
[1:08:46] called to the highest of all calls
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:52] we're not ephesus
[1:08:54] we're not smyrna we're not even leo the
[1:08:57] seer amen god has given us a new name
[1:09:00] and he's called us bride
[1:09:04] right we supersede we go beyond layer
[1:09:07] the seal and god has gifted us amen
[1:09:11] with all of the other ages everything
[1:09:13] they ever had god has given it to us
[1:09:16] but the truth of the matter is we
[1:09:18] sometimes fail to see what all of that
[1:09:21] is
[1:09:22] amen but the bride of jesus christ works
[1:09:25] by supernatural because she has a
[1:09:27] supernatural birth
[1:09:29] she is born not in the third dimension
[1:09:31] like she was born in a natural but she's
[1:09:33] been birthed again
[1:09:35] by the supernatural amen which brings
[1:09:37] her into the sixth dimension which
[1:09:39] finally takes her into the seventh
[1:09:41] and you and i must understand what do
[1:09:43] you mean brother brooks i'm saying when
[1:09:44] you when the holy spirit quickens you
[1:09:48] you have passed from death unto life
[1:09:50] amen amen and the scripture says you're
[1:09:53] resurrected amen
[1:09:55] hallelujah right oh i hope i get into
[1:09:58] resurrection no
[1:09:59] if you have passed from death unto life
[1:10:03] you have been resurrected
[1:10:05] you can no longer die
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:09] hallelujah oh you say well well
[1:10:11] physically well that's not the way god
[1:10:13] looks at it
[1:10:15] when tabitha died he said she wasn't
[1:10:17] dead she was sleep
[1:10:19] right
[1:10:20] we had a prophet go beyond the curtain
[1:10:22] of time and he saw all of those who
[1:10:24] people said was dead and they weren't
[1:10:25] dead
[1:10:27] they were much alive
[1:10:32] we've been invited to deity
[1:10:35] that's
[1:10:36] it's hard for carnal christians to
[1:10:38] understand that you said be careful
[1:10:40] brother be careful all i can say is that
[1:10:43] we're the children of god
[1:10:46] and if god is deity amen
[1:10:49] his spirit makes us deity
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:54] coming from the message
[1:10:56] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:10:58] the prophet of god says and in there
[1:11:01] there will be a time come forth
[1:11:04] when he could express himself in the
[1:11:07] fullness of his godhead listen to what
[1:11:10] i'm saying because the word godhead was
[1:11:13] brought into view
[1:11:15] by theologians
[1:11:18] you know god has always been one
[1:11:21] but when it comes into into a godhead we
[1:11:25] we want to make him three or we want to
[1:11:27] make him two
[1:11:28] or something like that but you got to
[1:11:30] understand
[1:11:31] that let's take it to the old testament
[1:11:35] when when when when king ahasura
[1:11:39] said to uh uh uh esther
[1:11:42] i give you half of the kingdom
[1:11:46] she was then joined into the what the
[1:11:51] godhead
[1:11:52] because he was the god he was the god he
[1:11:55] was god as far as we're concerned uh of
[1:11:58] of uh you know what i'm saying and so
[1:12:00] you and i must understand when christ
[1:12:01] says we become john heirs
[1:12:04] he places us into the godhead which is
[1:12:07] the authority of the word amen
[1:12:10] amen see that's what the devil don't
[1:12:12] want us to see
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:14] he don't want us to see the position and
[1:12:16] the authority and the power that's why
[1:12:19] brother adam said when he used that
[1:12:20] scripture after which the holy ghost has
[1:12:22] come upon you you shall receive power he
[1:12:25] said that word means authority amen
[1:12:28] amen amen
[1:12:30] hello amen and understand the authority
[1:12:33] of essa i love esther because it just
[1:12:34] tells all the story it's just the the
[1:12:36] revealing of the word is in such in that
[1:12:39] book in such a powerful way because not
[1:12:41] only was she john heir but she was the
[1:12:43] one who judged
[1:12:46] haman that's right
[1:12:47] and all of his children ain't that the
[1:12:51] word
[1:12:52] it will be the bride
[1:12:55] in his throne amen judging amen the
[1:12:59] whole entire world
[1:13:01] amen and you and i know that those that
[1:13:04] judgment comes to whom
[1:13:07] the devil
[1:13:08] and his children
[1:13:11] all his preachers and everything yes sir
[1:13:21] listen he goes on he says now listen the
[1:13:23] fullness of the godhead now you're
[1:13:25] getting into stuff crazy stuff brother
[1:13:27] because that's okay that's okay
[1:13:29] if you don't have a vision on where
[1:13:30] you're headed you'll never get there
[1:13:33] without a vision the people perish
[1:13:35] that was what was wrong with israel they
[1:13:37] couldn't catch the vision moses had and
[1:13:39] god made them wander in the wilderness
[1:13:41] for 40 years that's right amen they had
[1:13:44] lost sight of the of the of the of the
[1:13:46] promised land
[1:13:48] and all of that was because of their
[1:13:49] iniquity
[1:13:51] their disbelief
[1:13:52] in the message that moses was trying to
[1:13:54] bring them amen
[1:13:57] then god brought in a a few people that
[1:13:59] believe the vision amen called the
[1:14:01] vision joshua and caleb and at that time
[1:14:04] god took that too and headed the younger
[1:14:06] generation said let's cross over amen
[1:14:09] that's where we are
[1:14:11] you say what brother bruce what are you
[1:14:12] saying i'm trying to tell you you can
[1:14:15] never make this journey on your own amen
[1:14:18] none of the patriots take it all the way
[1:14:21] back to genesis if you like you find out
[1:14:23] that god was always in the picture
[1:14:28] was always directing he was always
[1:14:30] controlling he was always pushing and
[1:14:32] and doing things that you know we could
[1:14:35] see with our own eyes
[1:14:37] because god has a purpose
[1:14:39] and he takes pleasure
[1:14:41] in his purpose
[1:14:44] you're his purpose amen god could have
[1:14:46] made us all holy
[1:14:49] yes
[1:14:51] none of us had the taste of the world
[1:14:54] we didn't have to
[1:14:57] but god
[1:14:58] amen
[1:14:59] had a purpose
[1:15:02] and in that purpose he allowed some of
[1:15:04] us to get in things that others would
[1:15:06] not get into but that does not make you
[1:15:08] less of a saint because the part can't
[1:15:11] call the kettle black
[1:15:13] we're all sinners the bible says we're
[1:15:15] sinful creatures is that right the word
[1:15:17] of god says is there one righteousness
[1:15:20] no
[1:15:21] no none
[1:15:22] righteous there's only one that was
[1:15:25] righteous and that was jesus christ
[1:15:26] himself

[1:16:12] authority of god until you go you got to
[1:16:15] believe it that's right you got to

[1:16:37] little mice in the cat
[1:16:39] and how the cat would chase that mice
[1:16:41] around all
[1:16:42] over the room and everything else and
[1:16:43] one day that cat was going over over the
[1:16:46] table
[1:16:47] fell into a glass of wine
[1:16:49] got a little stimulated
[1:16:51] he came out where is that cat see that's
[1:16:54] what the anointing of god does it takes
[1:16:57] away the fear and it begins to give you
[1:17:00] something amen you didn't even know you
[1:17:02] had but the anointing of god makes you
[1:17:05] know that nothing could tell that rat he
[1:17:07] wasn't gonna defeat that cat
[1:17:10] amen no matter how big the devil is
[1:17:13] he's a little bitty thing when it comes
[1:17:16] to the holy spirit amen amen
[1:17:19] right

[1:17:24] y'all understand me the anoint let's put
[1:17:26] it this way people with christ
[1:17:29] the anointed people
[1:17:32] oh my
[1:17:33] bring back the anointed bride and the
[1:17:36] bridegroom anointed by why accepting
[1:17:40] what eve turned down
[1:17:42] and adam right
[1:17:44] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:17:46] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:17:49] see anointed with the word

[1:17:55] he comes back
[1:17:57] and we accept amen
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:04] this is a wonderful message we
[1:18:07] we keep looking and we keep finding we
[1:18:09] keep getting excited and you know and of
[1:18:11] course because of it uh the the the
[1:18:14] fights you know that are getting
[1:18:16] more intense
[1:18:20] but my thought is this
[1:18:24] what
[1:18:25] what what what is your what
[1:18:27] what do you have as value
[1:18:30] what you consider value
[1:18:33] nothing in this world
[1:18:35] everything you got naturally first of
[1:18:37] all has been given to you it's going to
[1:18:39] perish anyway
[1:18:41] what do you treasure is what i'm trying
[1:18:43] to say
[1:18:45] paul paul in treasure nothing he said if
[1:18:47] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:18:52] he said i have one waiting
[1:18:54] y'all understand what he said his own
[1:18:56] body his own flesh he didn't value it if
[1:18:59] he had valued it maybe he would not
[1:19:02] found himself in in situations where
[1:19:05] they killed him three times they beat
[1:19:07] him to death and they they did all kinds
[1:19:09] of stuff to him but paul didn't put
[1:19:11] value in this
[1:19:13] he had a greater treasure
[1:19:16] he understand me
[1:19:18] paul had climbed the ladder
[1:19:20] he got what he needed
[1:19:23] he understood
[1:19:25] what he wanted amen and he got it
[1:19:29] and many of the things that he gained
[1:19:31] had to come through suffering amen he
[1:19:33] said well i want to be like brother
[1:19:35] branham you want to go through the
[1:19:36] suffering he went through i don't think
[1:19:38] so
[1:19:40] we going to suffer yes
[1:19:42] but think about it a man anointed of god
[1:19:47] who was not even really in his own age
[1:19:51] a man born out of time born out of
[1:19:53] season
[1:19:54] and he comes he preaches a message that
[1:19:56] nobody could see
[1:19:58] kind of like jeremiah
[1:20:02] and every door was shut
[1:20:04] even at the end people who once he led
[1:20:07] to the holy spirit shut the door
[1:20:11] you pc and all the rest of them
[1:20:14] call them a false prophet
[1:20:16] why because the bible said in the last
[1:20:19] day leo and us here would be blind
[1:20:22] just like the jews were blind
[1:20:24] laodicea was blind
[1:20:27] couldn't even see her messiah
[1:20:30] not talking about the man i'm talking
[1:20:32] about that god in the man the word that
[1:20:34] he brought was the messiah amen
[1:20:37] that's hard to understand
[1:20:39] but let's go
[1:20:40] the unfolding of jacob's ladder
[1:20:43] you know jacob jacob jacob jacob had a
[1:20:45] dream

[1:21:43] you got doubting thomas they said oh let
[1:21:45] me feel this one thing for sure sure he
[1:21:48] when he when he got what he looked for

[1:21:58] you get it don't worry about what
[1:22:00] everybody else says
[1:22:02] and that's how thomas what he didn't
[1:22:04] guess about oh you don't believe you
[1:22:05] don't believe you don't believe thomas
[1:22:07] says i got to see
[1:22:09] sometimes you just got to see
[1:22:12] you won't be the first person in the
[1:22:13] bible that had to see
[1:22:17] most of those disciples didn't see they
[1:22:19] had to see
[1:22:20] they called mary and the rest of them
[1:22:22] crazy when they told him that he had
[1:22:24] risen
[1:22:25] and then after he comes through then
[1:22:26] they believed
[1:22:28] amen see you're not the only ones and
[1:22:30] don't feel so bad about that sometimes
[1:22:32] you just that's just the way you made it
[1:22:34] when you made that way god will let you
[1:22:36] see amen

[1:23:05] husband is not the one that's veiled i'm

[1:23:11] coming up in the marriage with his face
[1:23:13] failed no
[1:23:15] the woman comes because she's submitting
[1:23:17] herself to him his identity his

[1:23:25] you say i want to be i want to be uh
[1:23:28] you know the bride of jesus christ well
[1:23:29] the only reason way you can be the bride

[1:23:51] everybody thought it was a mystic cloud
[1:23:53] they didn't know what it was brother
[1:23:54] adam said it wasn't for them
[1:23:56] but there's a people on earth it was for
[1:23:59] that's right amen hallelujah everybody
[1:24:02] didn't see jesus when he walked in the
[1:24:03] flesh
[1:24:05] and the many of the ones who did see him
[1:24:07] called him a devil
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:10] call him unclean
[1:24:13] oh many times he he led a life of
[1:24:16] criticism
[1:24:17] but it did not take away from who he
[1:24:19] really was amen
[1:24:22] they hated him the religious people of
[1:24:24] that day
[1:24:25] like they did the prophet of this day
[1:24:27] they hate him
[1:24:29] lies oh you can't believe everything you
[1:24:31] read on the internet
[1:24:33] everything has been twisted and so lie
[1:24:35] they lie
[1:24:36] and you know what they took the man
[1:24:39] the man the weakness of a man
[1:24:41] to to to to vindicate their
[1:24:44] erroring ways
[1:24:47] the only perfect man that ever walked
[1:24:49] the earth is jesus christ himself
[1:24:51] and they still found fault
[1:24:54] harry said i find no vote he was the
[1:24:56] only one
[1:24:58] everybody else said crucified
[1:25:01] genesis 28 10 you love the lord
[1:25:04] and jacob
[1:25:06] went out from beth sheba and went toward
[1:25:09] haram
[1:25:10] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[1:25:13] carried there all night because the sun
[1:25:16] was set and he took the of the stones of
[1:25:20] that place and put them
[1:25:22] for his pillows
[1:25:23] and laid down in that place to sleep
[1:25:27] and he dreamed and behold a ladder
[1:25:30] set up on earth
[1:25:32] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[1:25:35] behold the angels of god ascended and
[1:25:37] descended on it
[1:25:39] and behold the lord stood be above it
[1:25:42] and said i am the lord of abraham thy
[1:25:45] father and the god of isaac this is what
[1:25:48] how you gonna say he's three i am he
[1:25:50] says i one
[1:25:52] i am the lord god of abraham thy father
[1:25:56] and the god of isaac the land thereon
[1:25:58] thou lieth to thee will i give it and to
[1:26:01] thy seed amen
[1:26:03] and thy seed shall be
[1:26:06] as the dust of the earth and thou shalt
[1:26:09] spread abroad to the west and to the
[1:26:12] east and to the north and to the south
[1:26:15] and in thee and in thy seed
[1:26:18] shall all the families of the earth be
[1:26:21] blessed in thee not around thee about
[1:26:24] thee but in thee and behold i am with
[1:26:27] thee and with keep thee in all places
[1:26:31] whether thou goeth
[1:26:33] and will bring thee again into this land
[1:26:36] for i will not leave thee until i have
[1:26:40] done that which i have spoken
[1:26:43] of the uh to thee of now now you
[1:26:46] understand what i'm saying
[1:26:50] god brought the promise
[1:26:52] the word cannot fail amen
[1:26:56] and you say well what do you mean let's
[1:26:57] just take for an example when israel was
[1:27:00] in germany
[1:27:01] and all over the world um if you know
[1:27:05] history god had blessed them
[1:27:08] they were wealthy
[1:27:09] artists and doctors and scientists and
[1:27:12] you name it they were in the high
[1:27:14] excellent of the of
[1:27:16] society but it was time for them to go
[1:27:19] back home
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:22] and god raised up
[1:27:24] hitler and mussolini and stalin and he
[1:27:27] raised up these men to drive them back
[1:27:30] and then the word of god said that they
[1:27:32] would go back on the wings of an eagle
[1:27:33] and they flew back
[1:27:36] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:27:38] it was his faithfulness don't you
[1:27:40] understand if god like us like like the
[1:27:44] prophet said you know the ego stirs the
[1:27:46] nest if god didn't stir the nest
[1:27:50] we would be complacent amen we would
[1:27:53] rest
[1:27:54] in such a way that we'll miss doing what
[1:27:57] he wants us to do and sometimes he's got
[1:27:59] to bring troubles in your life to get
[1:28:01] you stirred up to move amen
[1:28:06] yes lord
[1:28:07] whatever it takes
[1:28:16] that old devil was accusing me about my
[1:28:18] eyes says listen
[1:28:20] you know what i think about my eye
[1:28:22] nothing i said you know what i want more
[1:28:24] than anything fixed
[1:28:26] my soul
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:29] what if i've got 20 20 20 15 20 10 and
[1:28:33] my soul is not saved
[1:28:36] that's right what good is that
[1:28:38] amen
[1:28:40] the bible says it's better if you go
[1:28:43] into the kingdom of god maimed or lane
[1:28:49] that's more important than anything amen
[1:28:52] amen jacob prayed and remember jacob was
[1:28:55] a type of the believer
[1:28:57] jacob was a scheister y'all wasn't
[1:28:58] zeiss's were you but jacob was a shy
[1:29:01] star
[1:29:03] but inside of that cockapoo was a wheat
[1:29:05] germ
[1:29:07] which predestination was election
[1:29:10] and if god can get you to see this old
[1:29:12] nasty flesh that you're living in
[1:29:15] it's cursed amen this is not you amen it
[1:29:19] was given to you as a hybrid amen it was
[1:29:22] given to you by the way of sin but the
[1:29:25] inside man
[1:29:27] the one that god is changing and you
[1:29:30] fight every day thank god for the fight
[1:29:34] because when you're fighting that means
[1:29:36] something good is living inside amen
[1:29:40] amen hallelujah
[1:29:42] i'm trying my best not to get too
[1:29:44] stirred up because i could jump a little
[1:29:46] bit right now
[1:29:49] and and you know the thing that i didn't
[1:29:50] see for a long time and when i was
[1:29:53] studying this like i always wondered
[1:29:54] about jacob's ladder though i always had
[1:29:56] that in my heart in my mind what does
[1:29:58] that mean
[1:30:00] jacob's ladder
[1:30:01] and we know jacob wrestled with the
[1:30:03] angel
[1:30:04] and understand jacob had this dream
[1:30:07] before he met his wife
[1:30:09] but he was on his way together
[1:30:12] hallelujah so this ladder was a was
[1:30:14] really a prophecy
[1:30:16] in so much that
[1:30:18] he said
[1:30:19] this these these stones he he laid there
[1:30:22] as a pillow
[1:30:25] and he laid his hair
[1:30:27] resting on these stones
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:31] hallelujah
[1:30:33] and then the chief
[1:30:34] cornerstone
[1:30:37] the stone that was
[1:30:39] invisible
[1:30:41] began to talk to him by way of the dream
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:44] he saw the angels you you know what he
[1:30:47] saw he saw a preview of the opening of
[1:30:50] the word
[1:30:51] going and coming he saw what brother
[1:30:54] branham experienced
[1:30:56] brother braham said each moment each
[1:30:58] morning when those seals were open an
[1:31:00] angel would come
[1:31:02] amen ascending and descending
[1:31:06] right we didn't see it
[1:31:08] when those seven angels blasted out of
[1:31:10] heaven and we didn't see it
[1:31:13] but jacob's ladder was being formed
[1:31:17] his the way peter said it god made a way
[1:31:20] of entrance
[1:31:22] an abundant way of entrance into what
[1:31:26] the divine nature of god so that you
[1:31:28] could understand because the divine
[1:31:31] nature of god is heaven
[1:31:33] hallelujah
[1:31:36] and he's made that interest for us by
[1:31:39] way of jacob's ladder
[1:31:42] guess what
[1:31:43] god laid jacob there to make you
[1:31:45] understand you've got to wrestle
[1:31:49] to get it amen you got to fight with the
[1:31:52] angel
[1:31:53] to get it
[1:31:54] it's not going to come to you all yours
[1:31:57] i'm blessed jacob was blessed
[1:32:00] his daddy blessed him
[1:32:02] amen everything he put his hand to he
[1:32:05] was blessed
[1:32:07] but there was a birth that a a
[1:32:10] jacob had to have he had to have it
[1:32:12] because he could not
[1:32:14] defeat his brother
[1:32:16] he didn't have what it would take
[1:32:20] is always coming his way
[1:32:22] the world council is coming your way
[1:32:26] you're going to have to have something
[1:32:28] amen different that's right
[1:32:30] come on somebody the blessings were
[1:32:32] given to him
[1:32:35] why why you know he says you know what
[1:32:38] he you know even even jacob thought well
[1:32:40] if i just uh um
[1:32:42] send esau some good stuff
[1:32:44] but see he's always already rich
[1:32:47] how you gonna bless a rich man
[1:32:49] you understand me what can you give a
[1:32:51] rich man
[1:32:53] right
[1:32:54] and so we understand by god's grace amen
[1:32:57] the bible said jacob said to that angel
[1:32:59] i'm not going to let you go
[1:33:01] amen don't you understand there is an
[1:33:04] angel sure
[1:33:06] amen there's a spiritual being you
[1:33:09] personally have to wrap somewhere amen
[1:33:13] don't let him go until he bless you amen
[1:33:17] amen abraham seed
[1:33:19] and let me say it like this when jacob
[1:33:23] he said well i don't know what i can
[1:33:24] pray you know till the morning come well
[1:33:26] you don't have to worry about it you get
[1:33:27] in the channel god will take you there
[1:33:31] jacob didn't go there so well you know
[1:33:32] i'm going to pray and you know i'm just
[1:33:34] going to pray and i'm just going to pray
[1:33:35] no he knew in desperation he had to have
[1:33:39] more
[1:33:40] he had to have the supernatural he
[1:33:42] needed something amen that would carry
[1:33:44] him all the way through amen
[1:33:47] when that angel came he said amen you
[1:33:50] see what i'm saying
[1:33:52] but way of vision by way of the stream
[1:33:54] by way of this jacob's ladder somehow
[1:33:57] jacob understood he had to pray
[1:34:00] and get victories
[1:34:03] and he kept praying
[1:34:04] and in that prayer he got victory and
[1:34:06] you understand what i'm saying in that
[1:34:08] praying he held on to what he was
[1:34:10] looking for and he says i ain't gonna
[1:34:12] let you go until i get the promises of
[1:34:14] this message
[1:34:18] i'm not gonna let you go until i get the
[1:34:20] promises of these messages and what was
[1:34:22] it i'm gonna show you in just a moment i
[1:34:23] got a few quotes on this
[1:34:26] but what we feel see this is why the
[1:34:27] devil fights you in your prayer life
[1:34:30] you can't climb the ladder with without
[1:34:33] prayer
[1:34:34] prayer takes you upward
[1:34:37] it changes you it moves you from one
[1:34:39] dimension to the next
[1:34:41] brother of adam calling travail he said
[1:34:43] they say it's travail but in reality
[1:34:44] it's travel
[1:34:47] amen
[1:34:48] but prayer takes you there let me hurry
[1:34:50] up because i'm taking too much time
[1:34:53] see he had a night vision or dream of
[1:34:56] the latter that extended into the
[1:34:58] heavens and you got to understand jesus
[1:35:00] christ those stones
[1:35:02] amen was i don't know how many it was
[1:35:05] but i have to believe it was seven that
[1:35:07] that's my own saying
[1:35:09] but one thing i i know the completion is
[1:35:12] seven and you're going to read i'm going
[1:35:13] to read a quote where brother brother
[1:35:14] said that jesus christ was the
[1:35:15] foundation of jacob's ladder
[1:35:18] so you and i must understand that
[1:35:20] inspiration these stones that were being
[1:35:22] laid there amen were laid being laid
[1:35:25] there in representation of something
[1:35:27] else
[1:35:29] and the vision in which god gave him was
[1:35:31] a was a future uh event
[1:35:34] that he would that he was seeing he
[1:35:36] didn't understand it
[1:35:38] it was a prophecy it was something that
[1:35:40] was going to happen because god not only
[1:35:42] included him but he included his seed
[1:35:45] also in the prophecy amen
[1:35:49] and you and i we're it amen
[1:35:53] and listen oh god how i'm gonna get
[1:35:54] there you know jacob had no idea he was
[1:35:57] gonna fall asleep and gonna have a dream
[1:35:59] and he didn't have no idea he was gonna
[1:36:01] meet god
[1:36:02] who orchestrated that amen
[1:36:05] god did
[1:36:08] he's faithful and i'm resting on his
[1:36:11] faithfulness
[1:36:14] jacob witnessed the revelation of jesus
[1:36:16] christ that i am the first and the last
[1:36:18] the father the son and and of of jacob
[1:36:21] and of jacob the holy spirit type of the
[1:36:23] holy ghost because that's what jacob
[1:36:25] represented
[1:36:26] i've come to bless you and and to make
[1:36:28] you prosperous
[1:36:30] in his land in his this land and in the
[1:36:32] in this world and in the world to come
[1:36:34] now you gotta you gotta understand what
[1:36:36] i'm working with because you and i must
[1:36:38] understand that there is a position we
[1:36:40] must take and if we don't start praying
[1:36:42] we are going to miss it
[1:36:44] you gotta at least start it
[1:36:47] right
[1:36:48] god will
[1:36:49] put the fire to the fire but you got to
[1:36:52] start it you got to do something
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:56] take an opposition he gave us this is
[1:36:58] coming from the mess exposition of the
[1:36:59] seven church ages he said he gave us
[1:37:03] the open door of the word and power and
[1:37:06] that is what we are supposed to to use
[1:37:09] in other words when jacob saw
[1:37:12] god it was an open door
[1:37:14] to heaven he saw them coming and going
[1:37:17] it was open he saw it
[1:37:19] right and in this message we see an open
[1:37:21] door we saw what god did throughout the
[1:37:24] church ages they opened and and that's
[1:37:26] what jesus even promised his disciple he
[1:37:28] said from this point on you'll see
[1:37:29] angels descending in ascending amen and
[1:37:32] and you know we see that and the thing
[1:37:34] about it is we fail to see that they
[1:37:36] they're still here
[1:37:38] amen
[1:37:40] the company of angel
[1:37:42] are still here
[1:37:44] right now
[1:37:45] amen you don't see them but they're here
[1:37:48] they're watching in on this service
[1:37:52] yes sir but we fail to see it because we
[1:37:54] don't feel it we don't have to feel it
[1:37:57] faith declares it's there amen
[1:38:00] right it's like it's like it's like when
[1:38:02] the syrians came on elisha and then what
[1:38:05] happened lord opened this servant's eye
[1:38:08] that he might see there more of us than
[1:38:11] over there
[1:38:13] he couldn't see
[1:38:14] it amen and elijah didn't say elijah
[1:38:18] didn't say oh i feel that the company is
[1:38:20] here no he knew because of who he was
[1:38:24] somewhere he tapped into heaven and he
[1:38:26] understood that dimension there's no way
[1:38:28] of getting away from it amen we are so
[1:38:31] encompassed about with greater clouds of
[1:38:33] witnesses
[1:38:35] you can't get away even in your wrong
[1:38:37] doing there's somebody's watching you
[1:38:41] amen oh
[1:38:42] yes
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:48] word and power listen he gave us the
[1:38:50] open door of word and power and this is
[1:38:53] what i'm sick of it i'm sick of
[1:38:55] everybody word word word we need word
[1:38:59] and power amen
[1:39:00] that's right
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:04] oh you just don't major on the minor
[1:39:06] give me the minor first
[1:39:09] we'll work with it
[1:39:13] is that right brother branham had the
[1:39:15] minor right he had the the signs the
[1:39:18] wonders and he said it was bait debate
[1:39:20] to get the people to the word amen
[1:39:23] we need to be
[1:39:25] amen amen
[1:39:27] we need the supernatural
[1:39:30] word and power because that's a real
[1:39:32] gospel the gospel is not intellectual
[1:39:35] it's not making a good speech or some
[1:39:37] kind of you know
[1:39:39] articulation that can get the people all
[1:39:41] stirred up
[1:39:42] oh no paul said i did not come that way
[1:39:45] i came with power and demonstration
[1:39:49] that's the true gospel
[1:39:51] there god sent a prophet yes he did but
[1:39:54] where's the power come on amen
[1:39:57] amen today amen you understand me i'm
[1:39:59] tired of our people being sick
[1:40:01] i'm tired of the devil coming in and
[1:40:03] ravishing our bodies
[1:40:05] and you know we run to the hospital that
[1:40:07] ain't the way the new testament church
[1:40:08] worked
[1:40:09] we supposed to have the power in here
[1:40:12] amen that's what i want to see i'm not
[1:40:14] saying wrong anything wrong with the
[1:40:15] doctors work with it but you still need
[1:40:18] to call for jesus
[1:40:20] we want the lord jesus in this place
[1:40:23] and when i say in this place i mean in
[1:40:25] your bodies
[1:40:28] my body
[1:40:31] amen that is what gave paul his great
[1:40:35] and effective ministry
[1:40:37] first corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech
[1:40:41] and my preaching was not with entice and
[1:40:43] words of man wisdom but in the
[1:40:46] demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:50] he said that was what gave paul his
[1:40:53] great and effective ministry that's what
[1:40:56] gave william branham his great and
[1:40:59] effective ministry because god proved
[1:41:02] himself to be the same yesterday today
[1:41:04] and forever and in this bride you and i
[1:41:08] have been commissioned to prove that
[1:41:10] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:41:13] forever it's more than religion it's
[1:41:15] more than reading the word we all have
[1:41:17] done that come on somebody we've got
[1:41:19] mystery on top of mystery but what we
[1:41:21] don't we we we've got the mechanics we
[1:41:23] need the dynamics amen
[1:41:26] yes sir
[1:41:27] and some of us we got it god uses us but
[1:41:30] there's a greater there's a greater
[1:41:31] amenity there's a greater people there's
[1:41:33] a greater
[1:41:34] there's a greater is that right that
[1:41:36] paul passed by the shadow of paul and
[1:41:38] was healed
[1:41:39] come on somebody those peter james and
[1:41:42] john on their way down to
[1:41:43] to the gate of beautiful civil and gold
[1:41:45] have i not that's the new testament
[1:41:47] church you know why they were able to do
[1:41:49] that because they didn't have no creeds
[1:41:51] they didn't have no dogmas they were
[1:41:54] liberal they were free
[1:41:56] didn't have no bishops and elders and
[1:41:58] all of these hierarchy people they
[1:42:00] didn't have the rules and regulations
[1:42:02] that would stop them wherever god said
[1:42:04] go they went whatever god said do they
[1:42:07] did amen that's the bride of this day
[1:42:10] amen you gotta conquer
[1:42:13] all of this garbage that's been fed to
[1:42:15] us
[1:42:17] amen you need to be free
[1:42:22] you know we we we don't see some
[1:42:24] powerful preachers
[1:42:26] and after they finish preaching there is
[1:42:28] no change
[1:42:32] i need change
[1:42:36] i need change
[1:42:37] i need change for myself and i need to
[1:42:39] see
[1:42:40] change i'm not ashamed to say it people
[1:42:44] i need more god
[1:42:48] i need it i want more of him
[1:42:51] and i'm going to get it
[1:42:54] i don't know about everybody else in
[1:42:55] this room but this old boy
[1:42:59] don't get just what i've been i'm gonna
[1:43:01] get it ain't nothing gonna stop me
[1:43:04] from coming to that place that god want
[1:43:06] me to come to
[1:43:08] nothing i know i'm facing something i
[1:43:11] saw something in a dream
[1:43:12] real dark storm coming my way remember i
[1:43:15] told you
[1:43:16] but nothing will be able to shake me
[1:43:19] if god sent it he mean it means that i
[1:43:21] can stand amen
[1:43:26] the saddest thing about these kind of
[1:43:28] things is it's not from people outside
[1:43:29] the world at the church they're people
[1:43:31] in the church that's doing things
[1:43:35] and they don't think god sees it but god
[1:43:37] sees it
[1:43:38] they don't understand who i am that's
[1:43:40] why
[1:43:43] i am a true son of god i do know that if
[1:43:45] i don't know nothing else i do know that
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:50] coming from the message easter seal
[1:43:53] brother ben said and the real true
[1:43:55] believer
[1:44:02] don't care whether that he's backing up
[1:44:04] a denomination or nothing about it
[1:44:07] he only wants one thing for you to see
[1:44:10] that glorified christ
[1:44:13] makes any difference
[1:44:14] a real true mouth transfiguration
[1:44:17] experience only glorified jesus christ
[1:44:20] amen it didn't glorify moses didn't
[1:44:23] glorify elijah didn't glorify themselves
[1:44:27] didn't glorify nothing else
[1:44:29] but they seen the glorified christ
[1:44:33] and
[1:44:34] any true believer that's what's in his
[1:44:37] heart
[1:44:38] to glorify jesus christ amen that's what
[1:44:42] he's trying to get to the people to see
[1:44:45] amen
[1:44:48] well liz paul reminded me of this quote
[1:44:53] but you know i love this quote once i
[1:44:54] saw that it set me free
[1:44:57] because i saw everything i saw with the
[1:45:00] system even in this message have done to
[1:45:02] the people it it's all wrong yes amen
[1:45:05] and it's so easy to get into idolatry
[1:45:08] folks
[1:45:09] even so much so you can you yourself can
[1:45:11] become an idol sure
[1:45:14] everything must die everything must come
[1:45:17] back to the liberty in which god gave us
[1:45:19] because remember brother branham said
[1:45:20] when those seals were open it put us
[1:45:23] back into the garden of eden before the
[1:45:25] fall you understand what that means
[1:45:28] adam and eve was the god of the earth
[1:45:30] then amen that's where the godhead was
[1:45:33] amen join us she was with him oh my god
[1:45:37] and and folks this is what the message
[1:45:39] has brought us to
[1:45:40] but you if you don't believe it you'll
[1:45:42] never receive it
[1:45:44] mary said be it unto me according to thy
[1:45:47] word and it was done
[1:45:50] she didn't have to understand it i don't
[1:45:51] even have to understand everything i
[1:45:54] know it's real amen i know it's real sir
[1:45:58] hallelujah hallelujah can i go just a
[1:46:01] little bit longer
[1:46:02] hallelujah's got a quarter till i try to
[1:46:04] stop by 9.
[1:46:06] john 10 beginning at the first verse
[1:46:09] verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:46:11] entered entereth not by the door into
[1:46:14] the sheepfold but climbeth up some other
[1:46:17] way the same
[1:46:19] is a thief and a robber
[1:46:21] but he that entered in by the door is
[1:46:24] the shepherd of the sheep
[1:46:26] to him that the porter openeth and the
[1:46:29] sheep bear hear his voice
[1:46:32] and he calleth his own sheep by name and
[1:46:35] leadeth them out we would have never
[1:46:37] known what that meant
[1:46:41] but every messenger
[1:46:43] had a voice
[1:46:45] and everybody that heard the voice of
[1:46:47] that messenger
[1:46:49] were the sheep of jesus
[1:46:53] hallelujah
[1:46:54] and a stranger they will not follow but
[1:46:56] will flee from him for they know not the
[1:46:59] voice of strangers we don't have to hear
[1:47:01] the preachers we got it
[1:47:03] this parable speak speak jesus unto them
[1:47:06] because but they understood not what
[1:47:08] things they were which he spake unto
[1:47:11] them
[1:47:12] then said jesus unto them again verily
[1:47:14] verily which means truly truly i say
[1:47:16] unto you i am the door the sheep amen
[1:47:20] oh my god
[1:47:22] don't you see it
[1:47:24] what happened in 63 the door
[1:47:27] it was open
[1:47:29] to another time
[1:47:31] in space to another period
[1:47:33] to another age jesus himself came
[1:47:36] and guess what
[1:47:39] he's the shepherd that lays before the
[1:47:41] door
[1:47:42] that's what stumbles everybody and if
[1:47:44] you can't believe he's the door and if
[1:47:46] you don't see that that's jesus
[1:47:48] right you won't get in
[1:47:51] but my sheep
[1:47:53] here's my voice
[1:47:59] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:48:01] and robbers
[1:48:03] but the sheep did not hear them
[1:48:06] i am the door
[1:48:07] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[1:48:10] saved
[1:48:11] and shall go in and out and find pasture
[1:48:15] the thief cometh not but to steal
[1:48:18] to kill and to destroy
[1:48:20] i am come that they might have life and
[1:48:23] they they might have it more abundantly
[1:48:27] now brother banham tells of a story he
[1:48:28] says when i was over in the east i saw
[1:48:31] that at night the shepherd would gather
[1:48:34] all the sheep together
[1:48:36] he would put them into the fold
[1:48:38] then he would come
[1:48:40] count them who i love that word then he
[1:48:42] would count them
[1:48:45] when he was sure that they were all in
[1:48:48] if god can't go without want he's not
[1:48:51] leaving one behind
[1:48:53] he would lie down in the open door of
[1:48:57] the foe
[1:48:58] and literally come become the door to
[1:49:01] the fold
[1:49:03] no one could get in or out except by him
[1:49:07] he was the door amen even in the natural
[1:49:12] amen the shepherd
[1:49:14] you can't get into the fold
[1:49:17] that's why jesus said
[1:49:19] how did you get in here
[1:49:22] did you you could not have come in by
[1:49:23] the door
[1:49:24] you had to come in by another way
[1:49:28] right
[1:49:29] so you say brothers what do you mean
[1:49:30] just give me a space
[1:49:32] coming from the message god provided
[1:49:33] place of healing
[1:49:35] he said that's the way when we come to
[1:49:37] christ into christ if something seems
[1:49:40] just a little high step up in the gospel
[1:49:43] ranks and find out what belongs to you
[1:49:46] god's got a stepladder that reaches plum
[1:49:50] into glory
[1:49:51] jacob saw
[1:49:54] it one night with angels coming up and
[1:49:57] down from the earth to glory it's all
[1:50:00] yours huh that step ladder that ladder
[1:50:03] what jacob saw it's all yours god
[1:50:06] provided for you
[1:50:07] just get on it tonight and climb right
[1:50:12] on out of this earth bound people here
[1:50:16] that says the days of miracles has
[1:50:18] passed we are not earthbound people we
[1:50:21] are heavily bound people filled with the
[1:50:24] holy ghost climbing the ladder going to
[1:50:27] glory
[1:50:28] everything along the road belongs to us
[1:50:31] everything jesus died for belongs to us
[1:50:35] every day
[1:50:37] everything
[1:50:39] hallelujah
[1:50:42] thank you lord
[1:50:49] there's so much i know i can't read it
[1:50:50] all tonight but anyway
[1:50:53] we don't want to be left behind
[1:50:57] remember they asked a question and you
[1:50:59] heard me say this before the foolish
[1:51:01] version says give us of your why your of
[1:51:03] your oil and the wise version said you
[1:51:05] go pray up
[1:51:07] that struck me it just way though all
[1:51:09] those years ago when i first heard that
[1:51:11] it just
[1:51:12] hit me because i saw that was the
[1:51:14] solution
[1:51:16] and i'm gonna tell you right now satan
[1:51:18] fights all of us
[1:51:21] in prayer
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:25] he tries so hard just to get us to have
[1:51:28] a ritualistic prayer
[1:51:30] our father
[1:51:32] warden heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:51:35] you know
[1:51:37] i could tell you something right now but
[1:51:38] you may not understand it but let me say
[1:51:40] it like this when jesus was was talking
[1:51:42] you know
[1:51:44] let me say it like this who are in
[1:51:46] heaven where where is he now
[1:51:54] where is he if you are the tabernacle of
[1:51:56] god where is he now
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:04] god ain't far away
[1:52:06] but when jesus was teaching his
[1:52:08] disciples to pray he was teaching them
[1:52:11] something that they could understand
[1:52:12] because in their literature and their
[1:52:14] understanding god was far away
[1:52:19] that's so funny because he was standing
[1:52:21] right there teaching them
[1:52:26] and he told them said listen i've known
[1:52:28] you before the foundation of the world
[1:52:30] he told them that
[1:52:32] yes
[1:52:35] and he told them you shall receive power
[1:52:37] after which the holy ghost has come up
[1:52:39] with me and he also told him that the
[1:52:40] holy ghost is going to testify of me
[1:52:44] and the whole time their eyes were
[1:52:45] blinded
[1:52:48] amen what what made them after the day
[1:52:50] of pentecost silver and gold have i none
[1:52:53] but such as i have give id why didn't
[1:52:56] they say our father
[1:52:58] because the father was in them amen
[1:53:01] the very power of god that was in heaven
[1:53:03] was now in their earthly tabernacles
[1:53:10] hallelujah he said i'm sure see what i'm
[1:53:13] talking about
[1:53:14] it was wave now what's the use of having
[1:53:16] brother brandon what was the use of god
[1:53:18] bringing this man to on this time and
[1:53:20] this
[1:53:21] and had god wave
[1:53:23] you use him as a wave she not that the
[1:53:25] flesh was waved no it was the spirit of
[1:53:27] god it was the power of god we saw jesus
[1:53:30] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:53:32] forever we saw him alive yes
[1:53:35] amen
[1:53:37] so much so just like in the days of paul
[1:53:39] they thought paul was jesus they did
[1:53:42] because they saw the miraculous done
[1:53:43] through him and in the same day they
[1:53:46] thought william branham people got off
[1:53:48] they were wrong they made him an
[1:53:49] antichrist
[1:53:51] that's not what he was trying to get
[1:53:52] over to the people he was trying to get
[1:53:54] them to see that he was just a veil just
[1:53:57] a vessel and that the god that we serve
[1:53:59] is alive and well and using him as a son
[1:54:02] of man
[1:54:05] hallelujah and we still got it wrong
[1:54:08] so many people you know what i mean
[1:54:10] listen we think powers in these pictures
[1:54:12] ain't no power in these pictures
[1:54:16] you know i take the picture if i took
[1:54:17] these pictures down people leave the
[1:54:19] church
[1:54:20] because they're idolaters
[1:54:24] they think you can't be a message church
[1:54:25] without those pictures
[1:54:28] that's insanity
[1:54:31] amen
[1:54:32] that's insanity but that's the way
[1:54:34] people think
[1:54:36] are you defiling brother you defile
[1:54:40] that just show people's minds they
[1:54:42] messed up in their minds
[1:54:44] you know people wear all these little
[1:54:45] things i mean come on
[1:54:47] a friend of mine who was in the message
[1:54:49] a pastor
[1:54:51] meant this hindu
[1:54:52] and this hindu
[1:54:54] he told himself you ever heard of
[1:54:55] william branham he says oh yeah y'all
[1:54:57] worship the eagle
[1:55:00] y'all just like the hindus y'all worship
[1:55:02] other gods too he said no i don't
[1:55:04] worship no ego y'all know that's the
[1:55:06] truth though the people don't know it
[1:55:08] they got eagles everywhere
[1:55:12] they do
[1:55:14] and so to somebody who don't understand
[1:55:16] they know what they do in their religion
[1:55:19] and they see the same kind of idolatry
[1:55:21] you you know you're doing the same thing
[1:55:24] the brother said come on to my house and
[1:55:26] good day he didn't have no pictures and
[1:55:27] no eagles and everything all around his
[1:55:29] house he says no
[1:55:32] he said i'm not telling other people
[1:55:33] they can't have him but i know coming he
[1:55:36] was an indian brother coming from
[1:55:37] hinduism he knows what those little
[1:55:40] trinkets those little things can mean to
[1:55:42] some people
[1:55:45] man if you ain't got on a
[1:55:47] belt with the eagle log
[1:55:50] let me move on cause i'm being
[1:55:51] distracted my point is it's just
[1:55:54] stuff
[1:55:56] none of that brings you into the message
[1:55:58] you can have all of that stuff
[1:56:01] you can know every place and this is not
[1:56:03] being disrespectful that william branham
[1:56:06] went to and every
[1:56:08] but where is christ in you
[1:56:12] he's got to be in you brother branham
[1:56:15] has done what he's supposed to do
[1:56:17] and i give honor to him i can't hardly
[1:56:20] wait to meet him he ain't dead
[1:56:22] like some people think he is paul ain't
[1:56:25] dead and john and matthew ain't dead
[1:56:27] they're still alive in another dimension
[1:56:31] in one of these old days we'll see him
[1:56:33] amen
[1:56:37] but i'll tell you what he wouldn't be
[1:56:38] pleased at what he sees that people have
[1:56:40] done to this message i can tell you that
[1:56:42] now
[1:56:43] and i don't care if i'm looked at as
[1:56:45] being a heretic or rebellion a rebel
[1:56:47] i've always been a real rebel against
[1:56:50] organizations and systems and i see that
[1:56:52] thing clearer now than ever before and
[1:56:54] god has made me free
[1:56:57] and i don't care if nobody don't invite
[1:56:59] me to preach
[1:57:01] nowhere
[1:57:03] i don't
[1:57:05] i got souls out there that i still got
[1:57:07] to go preach to
[1:57:10] let me hurry up i'm so sorry i told you
[1:57:12] 15 minutes and got five minutes left
[1:57:16] listen and the first time they would
[1:57:18] come forth for the bride age for a
[1:57:21] resurrection out of dark
[1:57:24] wait a minute the first portion of this
[1:57:27] resurrection is to bring you out of dark
[1:57:29] denominationalism
[1:57:31] now this message came from it is the
[1:57:33] rising of the sun so understand your
[1:57:35] resurrection came when you first came
[1:57:38] out amen
[1:57:39] you believed this message
[1:57:42] and the life
[1:57:43] brought you out of it
[1:57:45] that's the beginning of it
[1:57:46] will be a mess he said for resurrection
[1:57:48] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[1:57:52] message and that the full maturity of
[1:57:54] the world has turned back again in its
[1:57:57] full power
[1:57:58] and being waived over the people by the
[1:58:01] same signs and wonders that the that he
[1:58:04] had back there because i live you live
[1:58:07] also speaking to his wife because i he
[1:58:11] lived also because i live you live also
[1:58:14] what a resurrection that's what see what
[1:58:17] a resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:58:20] from dead
[1:58:22] to be made alive in christ jesus by
[1:58:26] god's quickening power amen
[1:58:29] he was waved to them the word listen
[1:58:33] we wouldn't believe i mean
[1:58:35] we weren't there most of us
[1:58:38] but we saw it
[1:58:40] that that's what drew us to it because
[1:58:42] we knew no man can do these things
[1:58:46] and everything we've ever seen was what
[1:58:48] jesus did
[1:58:50] and what was it it was christ
[1:58:52] hidden behind the veil
[1:58:55] amen
[1:58:57] the appearing
[1:58:58] the coming however you want to say it
[1:59:01] he was there and he's still here yes sir
[1:59:04] you understand me
[1:59:06] now
[1:59:07] listen i'm moving on now and as long as
[1:59:09] i'm in christ this is from the
[1:59:12] infallible ability of god's spoken word
[1:59:14] as long as i'm in christ
[1:59:16] i'm anchored in god amen the angels
[1:59:19] ascending and descending going up first
[1:59:22] and then coming down see
[1:59:24] they're taking the message going up and
[1:59:27] bringing it back ascending and
[1:59:29] descending upon the son of man why he
[1:59:33] was the anchoring place where jacob's
[1:59:35] ladder where the promised seed would be
[1:59:39] he was god's eternal promised seed he
[1:59:42] was that sure stone that perfect that
[1:59:46] perfect foundation that god's truth
[1:59:49] would anchor
[1:59:50] in and the devils in hell and everything
[1:59:54] else could never move it
[1:59:56] god has anchored it forever you'll see
[1:59:59] the angels of god ascending and
[2:00:01] descending upon the son of man amen
[2:00:04] amen and what they didn't get it they
[2:00:06] didn't get it he wasn't the son of man
[2:00:09] but he was a son of man and god was
[2:00:11] using him in the opening of this word we
[2:00:14] now have an opening to heaven yes amen
[2:00:17] yeah
[2:00:18] and like i said you heard me say that
[2:00:20] before even
[2:00:21] you know in in it was as a songs a
[2:00:24] little i lift up your heads all your
[2:00:26] gates and let the kingdom of glory come
[2:00:28] in
[2:00:28] it was jesus yes
[2:00:31] the angels didn't open the door for
[2:00:33] everybody else it was jesus they opened
[2:00:35] the door for and everybody else followed
[2:00:37] amen that's the way it's going to always
[2:00:39] be
[2:00:43] this is it then i'm going to let you go
[2:00:47] forsaking all that's the subject
[2:00:51] of the message
[2:00:53] he said i think that's what christians
[2:00:55] ought to do tonight
[2:00:57] find out what you've got
[2:00:59] if something gets just a little high up
[2:01:02] that i can't reach it
[2:01:04] i'll get me a stepladder and climb up to
[2:01:07] it and if something seems a little out
[2:01:10] of reach in the bible that god has
[2:01:13] promised i stay on my knees
[2:01:16] and climb jacob's ladder
[2:01:19] till i reach it because it's mine god
[2:01:22] gave it to me amen
[2:01:25] if divine healing is promised in the
[2:01:27] bible and i'm sick i'll stay there till
[2:01:30] god gives it to me
[2:01:32] because it's a promise amen god promised
[2:01:35] and i forsake the world he'll give me
[2:01:37] the holy ghost i'll stay right there
[2:01:39] until he gives me gives it to me because
[2:01:42] he promised it if god promised to give
[2:01:45] me the desires of my heart and the
[2:01:47] desires of my heart is is the right
[2:01:49] thing i'll stay there till god gives it
[2:01:53] because it
[2:01:54] it's a promise and i've forsaken the
[2:01:56] world i want to walk after him and he
[2:01:59] will pay i know that to be true it's
[2:02:02] exactly right
[2:02:06] i had other things that i could
[2:02:08] say but uh
[2:02:09] brother adam goes on to say it's a birth
[2:02:11] and he says every every level faith
[2:02:14] virtue he said is a birth
[2:02:16] you got to be birthed into it that means
[2:02:18] you got to fight there's a struggle
[2:02:20] struggle all the way up but listen
[2:02:22] people the suffering of this world
[2:02:24] cannot be compared
[2:02:27] here's my last quote
[2:02:28] coming from he swore by himself
[2:02:33] man dropped plum down to here he's
[2:02:36] talking how far we dropped down as men
[2:02:39] the blood of sheep and goats held him
[2:02:42] still far this far as potentially until
[2:02:46] the fullness of the time came
[2:02:48] then god came down himself
[2:02:52] not an angel
[2:02:53] not a chair of him but god came down
[2:02:56] from heaven and he went all the way to
[2:02:59] hell to bring man up from hell to heaven
[2:03:03] with him he come hunting the lost sheep
[2:03:07] listen
[2:03:08] this is what you need to hear
[2:03:10] he found him
[2:03:12] and put him on his shoulder
[2:03:15] and climbing the ladder today with him
[2:03:18] going toward glory amen
[2:03:22] i picked up my grandson christopher i
[2:03:24] mean um judah i said judah come here
[2:03:26] and i took judah
[2:03:28] because remember brother brown said that
[2:03:31] he's not a priest anymore he's he's
[2:03:33] actually the judge and he wear the
[2:03:35] golden thing around his shoulder now and
[2:03:38] so anyway
[2:03:39] i picked up jude and i put him on my
[2:03:41] shoulder and i started climbing the
[2:03:43] ladder
[2:03:44] listen that's what he said he came he
[2:03:47] found you
[2:03:48] you're on his shoulder he's climbing the
[2:03:51] ladder
[2:03:52] not you
[2:03:53] he's climbing the ladder with you on his
[2:03:57] shoulder
[2:03:59] toward glory
[2:04:01] if i be lifted up from the earth i will
[2:04:04] draw all men unto me amen
[2:04:08] amen
[2:04:22] it makes you rest it gives you a rest
[2:04:25] now don't don't get me wrong it takes
[2:04:27] away the fear of being lost
[2:04:29] is what i'm saying
[2:04:30] god is going to bring us through amen
[2:04:33] right he's going to take us through and
[2:04:35] we've got to believe that but we also
[2:04:37] need to do our part
[2:04:39] when he's inspiring us
[2:04:41] do it
[2:04:44] when he say pray pray
[2:04:46] fast fast whatever just do what he says
[2:04:48] and stop trying to figure it out just be
[2:04:51] they that are led by the spirit of god
[2:04:53] they are the sons of god
[2:04:56] that's how it works
[2:04:58] you love the lord thank you for your

[2:05:15] you know everybody like to see people
[2:05:17] say
[2:05:18] and you know a wise young man said to me

[2:05:22] said brother brooks he said it's not
