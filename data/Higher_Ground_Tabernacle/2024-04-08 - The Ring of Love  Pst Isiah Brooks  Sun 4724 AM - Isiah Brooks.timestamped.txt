[59:10] for
[59:11] making she was baptized when she was
[59:15] younger but as a as a teenager now she
[59:19] wants to be re
[59:21] baptized and so I told her that was
[59:24] fine uh because it's about it's about
[59:27] your change of
[59:30] heart what God is dealing with you in as
[59:34] God is dealing with you in your
[59:38] heart hallelujah hallelujah uh the uh
[59:42] subject uh tonight uh this
[59:44] morning is the ring of
[59:49] love you know I I I have seen many
[59:55] afflicted
[59:56] [Music]
[59:59] many people
[1:00:02] deformed crooked
[1:00:05] and things like
[1:00:08] that and my heart has always gone out
[1:00:11] for
[1:00:15] them so is it in the
[1:00:18] spirit those that I see that are
[1:00:23] afflicted those who I've seen that are
[1:00:26] or how them said that he talks about
[1:00:31] Ed deformed
[1:00:33] Christians not that they're not
[1:00:36] Christians but is that something that
[1:00:39] has laid upon them
[1:00:41] and has hindered their
[1:00:44] growth but but my subject this
[1:00:48] morning ring of love I trust that it'll
[1:00:50] bless
[1:00:53] you because when I see people people
[1:00:56] that are
[1:00:58] afflicted I'm not there to scone or
[1:01:02] criticize many of them can't
[1:01:05] help how they were born or what tragedy
[1:01:09] took place in their
[1:01:12] lives no matter how we might dismantle
[1:01:17] that it stands still it stands
[1:01:21] true like I said people who are born
[1:01:24] blind
[1:01:26] need not to be scorned because they've
[1:01:28] been born
[1:01:31] blind matter of fact many people will
[1:01:34] never be able to see F
[1:01:39] fully until God open their eyes like it
[1:01:42] did the man born
[1:01:45] blind for 30
[1:01:47] years there's nothing you did nothing
[1:01:51] that I
[1:01:52] did that deserves this grace
[1:01:57] this Grace has been given by the
[1:01:58] almighty
[1:02:00] God uh you can't Merit
[1:02:03] it you can't bribe
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:06] him you can't borrow
[1:02:09] it you can't buy
[1:02:12] it it is something that God
[1:02:16] determined before the foundation of the
[1:02:19] world and because I have been doing uh
[1:02:24] weddings and I see uh the attitude of
[1:02:28] people who are being
[1:02:32] married matter of fact the last wedding
[1:02:35] we did
[1:02:37] have when we were doing the
[1:02:40] bows I told that brother and that
[1:02:44] sister I want you to look each other in
[1:02:47] the
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:49] eye see because when you look at each
[1:02:51] other in the
[1:02:52] eye if you're
[1:02:54] lying it will be
[1:02:58] seen
[1:03:00] right the eye as I I love that
[1:03:04] song it tells the
[1:03:08] story that's why the word of God talked
[1:03:11] about preachers seeing each other eye to
[1:03:15] eye when we talk about a
[1:03:18] ring a ring is a
[1:03:22] circle and it says even the ancient egyp
[1:03:28] ipans considered the circle to to be a
[1:03:31] symbol of
[1:03:35] eternity since a circle has neither uh
[1:03:39] beginning nor
[1:03:43] end it
[1:03:45] symbolize eternal
[1:03:47] love and The NeverEnding Bond of a
[1:03:54] marriage
[1:03:56] I want you to understand where I'm going
[1:03:58] with
[1:03:59] this because if we are the bride of
[1:04:04] Christ which we
[1:04:07] are God has done
[1:04:10] something and it's not something that
[1:04:13] was done in your day of
[1:04:16] birth what God Did He Did It Before Time
[1:04:22] began when we talk about wearing and I I
[1:04:26] wanted to
[1:04:28] know why do we put the ring on that on
[1:04:31] that left
[1:04:35] finger and I saw that wearing a ring on
[1:04:39] the left middle
[1:04:43] finger uh uh is a symbol it symbolize
[1:04:48] balance and and responsibility
[1:04:51] responsility hallelujah hallelujah so it
[1:04:54] brings the woman and the
[1:04:57] man into
[1:05:00] balance uh uh it brings uh them both
[1:05:04] into a
[1:05:07] responsibility to make
[1:05:09] sure that that love is never
[1:05:13] broken see when you put that
[1:05:16] ring on on on that
[1:05:20] finger it it it
[1:05:22] symbolizes that you have been uh
[1:05:26] chosen of
[1:05:29] God hallelujah you and your
[1:05:32] spouse uh uh uh before the foundation of
[1:05:36] the
[1:05:38] world the beautiful
[1:05:41] thing about our marriage to
[1:05:44] God is that the Lord didn't place it it
[1:05:48] it on our
[1:05:50] finger he placed the ring on our
[1:05:54] heart Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:56] and when that scripture comes till death
[1:05:59] do us
[1:06:03] part which is
[1:06:06] never for the Bride of
[1:06:08] Jesus Hallelujah and those who have been
[1:06:12] chosen and elected by
[1:06:15] God cuz death cannot depart
[1:06:19] us so much so death is done away
[1:06:24] with death is done away
[1:06:28] with and eternal life is the ring of
[1:06:33] God hallelujah hallelujah now we
[1:06:37] look uh in the uh Hebrew where we
[1:06:41] read every time I read this passage of
[1:06:47] scripture I I literally see the Bride of
[1:06:50] Jesus
[1:06:53] Christ uh in in A
[1:06:58] procession standing before God moving
[1:07:01] toward
[1:07:02] God as a royal
[1:07:05] people and here Paul picks it the picks
[1:07:08] it
[1:07:09] up and he expresses the
[1:07:13] respect that he have for the
[1:07:17] bride and the body of
[1:07:19] Christ Hallelujah and he goes on to say
[1:07:24] to the general
[1:07:26] Assembly Church of the
[1:07:29] firstborn which are written in
[1:07:32] heaven not on the majestry
[1:07:36] book not down at the State
[1:07:40] House not not in the church
[1:07:43] book but written in
[1:07:47] heaven and to God the judge of
[1:07:51] all hallelujah hallelujah and this is
[1:07:54] what I like and to the spirit of just
[1:07:57] men made
[1:07:59] perfect Hallelujah the Bible says and
[1:08:04] Jesus the mediator of New
[1:08:07] Covenant and to the blood of
[1:08:11] sprinkling that speaketh better than
[1:08:14] that of
[1:08:16] Abel and I always wondered what that
[1:08:20] meant
[1:08:22] because Abel wanted Revenge
[1:08:27] Hallelujah but when it came to Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ he said father forgive
[1:08:34] them for they know not what they do
[1:08:38] hallelujah hallelujah if we could really
[1:08:40] see
[1:08:42] that that that statement that Jesus
[1:08:46] made carries all the way through
[1:08:50] time because when Jesus saved the
[1:08:54] Earth saved
[1:08:57] everybody hallelujah hallelujah the only
[1:09:00] reason why people go to
[1:09:02] hell is because they refuse to accept
[1:09:06] Jesus Christ as their
[1:09:09] savior hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[1:09:15] truth the 5ifth 25th verse says seek
[1:09:20] seek that he refuse not him that
[1:09:24] speak if they escape not who refused him
[1:09:28] that speaketh on Earth much more shall
[1:09:32] not we escape if we turn away from him
[1:09:37] that speaketh from
[1:09:39] Heaven Hallelujah huj whose voice then
[1:09:43] shook the
[1:09:44] Earth but now have Pro prom now he have
[1:09:49] promised saying yet once more I shake
[1:09:54] not the Earth only
[1:09:56] but also heaven and we know at the
[1:09:59] opening of the word at the opening of
[1:10:01] the seals there was a mighty shaking on
[1:10:04] Earth and there was a mighty shaking in
[1:10:08] heaven why because this message came
[1:10:12] from Heaven Hallelujah and to
[1:10:16] disobey this message Hallelujah will be
[1:10:20] refusing Jesus Christ
[1:10:22] himself Hallelujah Jesus Christ is is
[1:10:25] not a
[1:10:26] denomination Jesus Christ is not an
[1:10:29] organization Jesus Christ is the word
[1:10:33] hallelujah and that word
[1:10:36] lives Hallelujah let me ask you a
[1:10:41] question which of
[1:10:44] you can truly
[1:10:46] say that you're
[1:10:48] perfect within
[1:10:52] yourself none of us can
[1:10:55] because our Perfection only comes by
[1:10:57] Jesus
[1:11:00] Christ listen how many of
[1:11:03] you can truly say I found the
[1:11:07] Lord none of us can
[1:11:09] say that we found the
[1:11:12] Lord listen what brother Adam says
[1:11:15] coming from Israel in the
[1:11:18] church
[1:11:21] 1953 he
[1:11:23] said that wasn't why I got
[1:11:26] saved that wasn't why you got
[1:11:29] saved you got saved because God chose
[1:11:33] you before the foundation of the
[1:11:37] world to be
[1:11:39] saved that's the scripture teaching amen
[1:11:42] now you see we begin to find out it's
[1:11:46] not
[1:11:47] us it's him see he chose
[1:11:53] us hallelujah Hallelujah I'm going read
[1:11:56] another one Hallelujah coming from sir
[1:12:00] we will see
[1:12:02] Jesus brother goes on to
[1:12:05] say there comes the battle of
[1:12:10] Armageddon ready for the
[1:12:13] Millennium for he is Lord of
[1:12:16] Lord King of Kings hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:20] don't be shook
[1:12:21] up and they that are with him are called
[1:12:26] The
[1:12:28] Chosen not you he has you got the Holy
[1:12:33] Ghost you ought to shout
[1:12:36] Victory God chose you before all the
[1:12:39] foundation of the
[1:12:41] world if you can't see the Gospel
[1:12:44] Light it's because you you just
[1:12:47] blind Hallelujah is that all right if
[1:12:51] you can see it you don't see it because
[1:12:54] you think you got eyes to see you see it
[1:12:58] because God chose you to
[1:13:01] see Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:13:04] saying let me sing another one coming
[1:13:07] from sir we will see Jesus paragraph
[1:13:13] 82 Hallelujah he said and then
[1:13:18] remember if you were if ever was if you
[1:13:21] ever was in God's
[1:13:24] thinking will always be
[1:13:27] there wait a
[1:13:28] minute that means nobody can take me
[1:13:32] out nobody put you
[1:13:34] in if you've been in the thoughts of
[1:13:37] God nothing can take you
[1:13:40] out Hallelujah if you got eternal life
[1:13:45] you are the
[1:13:46] expression or the
[1:13:48] attribute all his thoughts for this
[1:13:52] age
[1:13:53] not if not not you there's only one
[1:13:57] eternal
[1:13:58] life and it's always
[1:14:01] existed and you in his mind existed
[1:14:05] before there was a
[1:14:07] world that's the reason he said he chose
[1:14:10] you before the foundation of the
[1:14:13] world it wasn't what we think what
[1:14:17] someone somebody else think is what God
[1:14:21] Eternal you always will see
[1:14:26] in his
[1:14:29] thinking hallelujah hallelujah and what
[1:14:31] did God
[1:14:33] do what God gave
[1:14:35] us he gave to no other Church
[1:14:43] age no other Church age the Bible says
[1:14:47] they cannot be
[1:14:50] completed without
[1:14:53] us is that right
[1:14:55] we are the
[1:14:59] crown hallu of his uh
[1:15:03] Redemption y'all understand me there's
[1:15:07] not another church age that's
[1:15:09] coming there's not another Prophet
[1:15:12] coming hallelujah hallelujah I I know
[1:15:15] some people think that but you can think
[1:15:18] whatever you want to
[1:15:19] think we're about to embrace the
[1:15:23] translation of these Wicked bodies here
[1:15:27] hallelujah that's exactly the
[1:15:29] truth the ring he gave me before the
[1:15:33] foundation of the world now think about
[1:15:36] it if he gave you a ring it wasn't the
[1:15:40] Ring of
[1:15:42] Engagement it was the Ring of
[1:15:45] marriage hallelujah hallelujah you and I
[1:15:49] was his
[1:15:50] wife before the foundation of the
[1:15:53] world Hallelujah Hallelujah this is why
[1:15:56] we can make ourselves ready only the
[1:15:59] wife of God will have the ability to
[1:16:04] make herself
[1:16:05] ready everything else falls under
[1:16:09] foolish
[1:16:10] virgins Hallelujah but thank God for the
[1:16:14] foolish because at least they're

[1:16:34] can't help but saying if you don't feel
[1:16:37] that pull in your heart if you don't
[1:16:39] feel that urgency that something's about
[1:16:41] to
[1:16:44] happen well I I can't give that to you
[1:16:47] only God can give that to
[1:16:50] you because the foolish versions were
[1:16:53] dilatory
[1:16:55] wasting time cares of this world
[1:16:59] Hallelujah when the wise
[1:17:02] virgins she put oil and extra
[1:17:06] oil Hallelujah can I say it like this

[1:17:23] become this

[1:17:29] given to you to have an intellectual
[1:17:35] advantage over the church World it came
[1:17:38] to you so God could change
[1:17:42] you Hallelujah this message came from

[1:17:47] glory and the bread that came from out
[1:17:51] of there was living bread was bread that
[1:17:55] would transform you Hallelujah not only

[1:18:02] that will translate
[1:18:04] you

[1:21:45] his
[1:21:47] mouth for thy
[1:21:49] love is better than
[1:21:53] wine and we know what his love
[1:21:56] is his love is when he reveals
[1:22:00] himself
[1:22:02] Hallelujah why because that
[1:22:04] word becomes
[1:22:07] stimulated and it's better than
[1:22:10] Wine Hallelujah and when someone gives
[1:22:13] you a
[1:22:15] kiss Hallelujah that means that
[1:22:18] particular I'm talking about real
[1:22:20] now I'm not talking about this perverted
[1:22:23] stuff he kissed me when I receive this
[1:22:29] message because the message is
[1:22:32] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and a kiss
[1:22:36] it is when a touch with the
[1:22:39] lips a sign of
[1:22:42] love oh y'all don't get
[1:22:44] it hallelujah hallelujah it is a sign of
[1:22:48] love what do we
[1:22:50] do out when when all of the wedding
[1:22:53] things are being
[1:22:55] said the Rings have been placed on the
[1:22:58] finger the last thing we say to the
[1:23:02] couple you may now kiss the
[1:23:05] bride Hallelujah and that kiss seals
[1:23:10] them
[1:23:11] intimately Hallelujah in a natural way
[1:23:16] Hallelujah that's exactly right they
[1:23:19] become one
[1:23:21] flesh amen one spirit
[1:23:25] one body Hallelujah one person is that
[1:23:29] right oh y'all don't like this but I'm
[1:23:32] going to preach it
[1:23:33] anyhow Hallelujah reverence and
[1:23:37] respect is what people don't know how to
[1:23:41] give hallelujah hallelujah and that's
[1:23:44] what the problem is when you don't your
[1:23:47] attitude toward the
[1:23:49] word hallelujah will determine where you
[1:23:52] go how God resp respond to
[1:23:55] you Hallelujah now we look at this thing
[1:23:59] and we understand that when when when
[1:24:02] two people become
[1:24:04] one they they somehow begin to to
[1:24:09] develop the same
[1:24:11] mind the same way of
[1:24:14] thinking sometime my wife and
[1:24:17] I responds in the same
[1:24:20] way when a question is asked or
[1:24:23] statement is
[1:24:25] made sometime we respond in
[1:24:28] unison Hallelujah because we have become
[1:24:31] one our way of thinking has become one
[1:24:35] Hallelujah there will always be
[1:24:38] variations because she's a woman and I'm
[1:24:40] a man but for the most part my wife
[1:24:44] knows what I would like and she knows
[1:24:47] the things I dis like and for the and
[1:24:51] and likewise I know what my wife like
[1:24:55] and I know what my wife would not like
[1:24:59] hallelujah hallelujah what is it to
[1:25:01] having the same
[1:25:03] Spirit Hallelujah is that right second
[1:25:08] Corinthians
[1:25:10] 3:18
[1:25:23] Hallelujah
[1:25:32] you love the
[1:25:37] Lord I always tell people you know when
[1:25:40] it comes to the word of the
[1:25:45] Lord you need to respect the
[1:25:48] word you don't necessarily have to
[1:25:50] respect the
[1:25:51] man but you need to respect the word
[1:25:55] and uh you know I I I look at people and
[1:25:59] my heart goes
[1:26:01] out because so many people are just
[1:26:05] you're religious and don't even know
[1:26:08] it you think you got it
[1:26:10] right but every time I fall on my
[1:26:14] knees I realize that I need the grace
[1:26:16] and mercy of
[1:26:19] God 2 Corinthians
[1:26:22] 3:18 but we all
[1:26:25] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:26:29] the glory of the Lord a Chang in the
[1:26:32] same image from glory to glory even as
[1:26:37] by the spirit of the Lord do y'all
[1:26:41] understand what that means we supposed
[1:26:43] to be
[1:26:45] changing into the glory of
[1:26:49] God little by little step by step we
[1:26:53] supposed to be changing into the glory
[1:26:55] of
[1:26:56] God now I want you to think about how
[1:26:58] much you've
[1:27:00] changed in the last year or
[1:27:03] two hallelujah hallelujah there's
[1:27:05] supposed to be changes in your
[1:27:08] life but many times as you heard me say
[1:27:14] we know how to
[1:27:16] confess our sins but we don't know how
[1:27:19] to surrender to
[1:27:21] surrender our Hallelujah
[1:27:24] Matthew
[1:27:26] 19 Hallelujah you love the Lord I'mma
[1:27:29] keep going Hallelujah Matthew 19
[1:27:35] 56 and he said for this cause shall a
[1:27:39] man leave father and
[1:27:41] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[1:27:45] they twain shall be one
[1:27:48] flesh wherefore there are no more Twain
[1:27:52] but one flesh
[1:27:55] hallelujah what therefore God have
[1:27:58] joined together let not man put us
[1:28:01] under hallelujah hallelu what are you
[1:28:03] talking about in the marriage God has to
[1:28:07] join you
[1:28:08] together and you are joined together by
[1:28:12] God by your own
[1:28:14] vows hallelujah hallelujah is that right
[1:28:18] oh y'all looking at me I'm speaking
[1:28:20] spiritually I'm speaking
[1:28:22] spiritually you are join to God by your
[1:28:26] own
[1:28:27] confession Hallelujah and God will hold
[1:28:31] you
[1:28:33] responsible Hallelujah I don't care how
[1:28:36] much you say you are a
[1:28:37] Christian you are married to Christ the
[1:28:40] word and every time you break his word
[1:28:44] you will have to give an account for it
[1:28:47] Hallelujah because God will not
[1:28:51] marry an adulterous woman or man
[1:28:56] he won't do it he can't do
[1:28:59] it y'all hear what I'm
[1:29:01] saying now I I I didn't know all of this
[1:29:04] was coming out this
[1:29:05] morning Hallelujah but a wedding
[1:29:08] ceremony is a beautiful
[1:29:10] thing I'm talking about the ring of love
[1:29:14] and some sometime we we take this thing
[1:29:16] too
[1:29:19] lightly in such a common
[1:29:21] way and God God can't have
[1:29:25] that Hallelujah you got to be completely
[1:29:28] sold out to
[1:29:31] God hallelujah hallelujah if my mother
[1:29:34] don't go if my sister don't go if my
[1:29:37] brother don't go if my father don't go
[1:29:40] if my wife don't go Hallelujah I'm going
[1:29:43] all the way just to see
[1:29:47] him you've got to be determined in this
[1:29:53] day here it is Isaiah 9
[1:30:00] 6-7 and I want to say when I started
[1:30:03] this message I did not have one single
[1:30:06] person in
[1:30:07] mind this is not to bash you or to to to
[1:30:10] to bring down you bring you down this is
[1:30:13] what God prepared this is what I'm
[1:30:16] preaching Hallelujah Isaiah 9
[1:30:20] 6-7 For unto us a child is born
[1:30:25] unto us a son is
[1:30:28] given and the government shall be upon
[1:30:30] his
[1:30:32] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:30:35] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:30:39] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:30:43] hallelujah hallelujah look what the
[1:30:45] prophet says Isaiah 69
[1:30:50] and6 and the government shall be upon
[1:30:52] his shoulder
[1:30:55] what does this mean the answer is this
[1:30:59] the phrase the governor upon his
[1:31:03] shoulder from the wedding ceremony of
[1:31:06] the
[1:31:09] East when the bride has been committed
[1:31:11] to the
[1:31:12] groom she takes off her
[1:31:16] veil and place it over the groom's
[1:31:20] shoulder
[1:31:21] signifying that not only is is she under
[1:31:25] his
[1:31:27] Dominion that she has
[1:31:30] transferred her right to him and he is a
[1:31:34] head but also that he Bears the
[1:31:39] responsibility see a lot of time we take
[1:31:41] oh I'm the head but you also the man
[1:31:45] Bears a
[1:31:46] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:31:50] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:31:54] other power has any right and
[1:31:59] responsibility and that belove is the
[1:32:02] Key of
[1:32:03] David God being
[1:32:05] Sovereign he forew by Divine
[1:32:09] decree
[1:32:11] exactly who would be in his bride he
[1:32:14] chose her she did not choose him he
[1:32:17] called her she did not come on her own
[1:32:21] he died for her he washed her in his own
[1:32:24] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:32:27] belongs to him and to him alone she is
[1:32:31] wholly committed to him and he accepted
[1:32:34] the obligation he is her head for Christ
[1:32:38] is the head of his church and as Sarah
[1:32:41] called Abraham Lord even so the bride is
[1:32:44] happy that he is her Lord he
[1:32:47] spake and she obeyed for what for that
[1:32:51] is her
[1:32:52] Delight
[1:32:55] now we ain't talking about them half
[1:32:59] stepping want to be

[1:48:10] circle that has no beginning nor ending
[1:48:13] the Bible said charity never fad I'm
[1:48:18] almost done I'm almost done Matthew
[1:48:21] 26:36 6- 44 I just got one major quote I
[1:48:26] want to read to you all before I let you
[1:48:30] go Matthew
[1:48:32] 26 36- 34
[1:48:40] 44 you
[1:48:44] know we we we we we
[1:48:47] uh that Solomon had a
[1:48:51] a a revelation
[1:48:54] he said there's a time and season for
[1:48:56] all
[1:48:57] things there's a time for
[1:48:59] laughter a Time For Crying y'all know
[1:49:03] how he goes there's always a time but if
[1:49:07] I got brother bam
[1:49:09] right he tells us that this is a time of
[1:49:13] urgency he he preached a message
[1:49:16] desperation and he said if you don't get
[1:49:19] desperate it'll be so simple it'll pass
[1:49:21] right through you
[1:49:23] and you won even know
[1:49:27] it I don't see I don't see how people
[1:49:31] can sit there and say I'm
[1:49:36] bride and yet have no evidence of
[1:49:46] it the V supposed to
[1:49:49] know and she's supposed to see it these
[1:49:53] signs shall follow them that
[1:49:56] believe hallelujah hallelujah then come
[1:49:59] Jesus with them un a place called
[1:50:03] Geth and said unto the disciples sit ye
[1:50:08] here why I go and pray
[1:50:12] Yonder you say brother book don't you be
[1:50:14] preaching these things to the people
[1:50:16] that's bringing that Spirit
[1:50:19] down the only way I can help you is
[1:50:22] bring it down God will pick it
[1:50:26] up but if I don't bring it down you'll
[1:50:30] keep going up thinking you got something
[1:50:33] that you don't
[1:50:36] have I'm not interested in a number of
[1:50:38] the
[1:50:40] church it ain't about how many people
[1:50:42] come
[1:50:44] here there are men who are deceiving
[1:50:48] people taking the same
[1:50:51] message and making people think you okay
[1:50:55] this is all Grace it is but in Grace
[1:50:59] there is a
[1:51:01] work there's a work of Grace that brings
[1:51:04] us to
[1:51:05] Perfection Hallelujah it does not leave
[1:51:09] us in a state of a sinful man or woman
[1:51:13] Hallelujah but this message brings us
[1:51:17] from
[1:51:17] justification to sanctification to the
[1:51:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost brother brand
[1:51:23] said it makes room for the Holy Ghost
[1:51:26] himself Hallelujah you can't remain in
[1:51:30] the way you are oh you you got a temper
[1:51:34] that's got to go you got L that must go
[1:51:40] Hallelujah if you're drinking that must
[1:51:42] go if you're smoking that must go if
[1:51:47] you're hating your brother and sister
[1:51:49] that must go you're not to
[1:52:00] Heaven hallelujah
[1:52:03] hallelujah now that was not
[1:52:08] me then cometh
[1:52:11] Jesus with them unto a place called
[1:52:15] GE and said unto the
[1:52:18] disciples sit you
[1:52:21] here while I go and pray
[1:52:24] Y and he took with Peter and the two
[1:52:28] sons of zebede and began to be a
[1:52:32] sorrowful and very
[1:52:36] heavy then said he unto them my soul is
[1:52:40] exceedingly
[1:52:41] sorrowful even unto death carry you here
[1:52:46] and watch with me now this is the Lord
[1:52:49] Jesus
[1:52:51] Christ approaching his
[1:52:54] judgment and
[1:52:56] crucifixion he was not
[1:52:59] laughing he was he was not joking like I
[1:53:02] do sometimes wrong he was
[1:53:06] sinere about the moment he was about to
[1:53:08] Embark upon Hallelujah I'm talking about
[1:53:12] the Son of God I'm talking about God
[1:53:15] manifested in
[1:53:17] theh took that moment
[1:53:21] seriously
[1:53:23] and he said my soul is exceedingly
[1:53:27] sorrowful even unto death T here and
[1:53:31] watch with me and he went a little
[1:53:34] further and fell on his face and prayed
[1:53:39] saying oh my father if it be possible
[1:53:43] let this cup pass from me nevertheless
[1:53:46] not I as I will but as thou wil y'all
[1:53:50] understand me as a man as a man
[1:53:53] he wanted God to move that out of the
[1:53:55] way Hallelujah but he had a
[1:53:58] duty Hallelujah he had a
[1:54:01] purpose and that Duty and purpose was to
[1:54:05] suffer for you and I you and me
[1:54:08] Hallelujah he didn't throw it away he
[1:54:11] saw what he had to do but one thing I
[1:54:15] know about him Hallelujah he needed help
[1:54:19] now think about it the son of God asking
[1:54:22] his fellow
[1:54:27] Christians help me
[1:54:29] pray help me pray even when we ask each
[1:54:33] other help me
[1:54:35] pray I wonder how many of y'all help us
[1:54:38] pray do you just fall asleep ignore the
[1:54:42] request of
[1:54:44] prayer Hallelujah y understand me they
[1:54:47] did it and the reason why they did it
[1:54:50] they had not yet gone to Pentecost
[1:54:54] Hallelujah but when Pentecost is coming
[1:54:57] G when Peter and them were thrown in the
[1:55:00] jail they
[1:55:03] prayed the saints of God
[1:55:05] prayed and they prayed and they prayed
[1:55:08] and they
[1:55:09] pray hallelujah hallelujah until the
[1:55:13] Peter name was delivered that's the
[1:55:15] Church of the Living God we don't give
[1:55:18] up on our people when Satan comes like a
[1:55:24] the spirit of the Lord lifts up a
[1:55:26] standard we supposed to be prayer
[1:55:29] warriors come on somebody it doesn't
[1:55:32] matter if it's your house or somebody
[1:55:34] else's
[1:55:35] house Hallelujah no demon should come in
[1:55:39] this
[1:55:46] place hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear
[1:55:49] what I'm saying I'm tired of this church
[1:55:51] being de
[1:55:54] and it's not God's
[1:55:55] fault it's our
[1:55:59] fault God is already healed and
[1:56:01] delivered over 2,000 years ago
[1:56:05] hallelujah hallelujah and it's because
[1:56:07] we don't
[1:56:12] believe that
[1:56:14] okay what happened he watched he come
[1:56:17] along he kept him pray for me he went
[1:56:21] three times
[1:56:24] after the third
[1:56:25] time he sleep
[1:56:29] on now is that right now if Jesus did
[1:56:33] that to his
[1:56:34] disciples do you think you're going to
[1:56:37] escape if he's constantly telling you
[1:56:39] pray and you don't pray he going to say
[1:56:43] sleep
[1:56:44] on and what happened when the enemy came
[1:56:49] they all
[1:56:51] scatter fail to
[1:56:55] pray you love the Lord let me move on
[1:56:58] I'm almost
[1:56:59] done look what brother Adam says here in
[1:57:03] the exposition of the seven
[1:57:05] churches he said
[1:57:07] uh and he left them oh I'm sorry but let
[1:57:11] me tell you
[1:57:13] now salvation is not Jesus

[1:57:39] rock and God will give you the Holy
[1:57:43] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah you may not
[1:57:45] ever never never never know
[1:57:48] everything that the Seven Seals is says
[1:57:53] but once you are sealed with the Holy
[1:57:56] Ghost hallelujah it's not
[1:57:59] extra I got to do this
[1:58:02] plus I got to have this
[1:58:05] plus it's Jesus
[1:58:08] alone salvation is of the
[1:58:11] Lord from the start to the finish it is
[1:58:15] all
[1:58:16] God let his life be in
[1:58:19] me let his blood uh that C uh CLE you
[1:58:23] see let it be his blood that cleanses
[1:58:27] me let it be his
[1:58:29] spirits me let it be his word in my
[1:58:34] heart and mouth let it be his stripes
[1:58:38] that healed me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus

[1:58:57] right be zous to
[1:58:59] repent to repent Hallelujah
[1:59:04] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:59:07] Hallelujah
[1:59:08] Hallelujah you see Jesus had to
[1:59:12] overcome St John
[1:59:15] 16:33 these things I have spoken unto
[1:59:18] you that in me you might have peace
[1:59:22] in the world ye shall have
[1:59:25] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[1:59:29] overcome World hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:32] it's him Jesus
[1:59:35] alone who overcomes the world Hallelujah
[1:59:40] first John 2 up
[1:59:43] 14 I have written unto you fathers
[1:59:47] because you have known him that is from
[1:59:50] the
[1:59:51] beginning
[1:59:52] I have written unto you young men
[1:59:55] because you are strong and the word of
[1:59:58] God abideth in you and ye have overcome
[2:00:02] the wicked one Hallelujah hallu let's
[2:00:05] move on 1 John
[2:00:08] 4:4 ye are of God little children and
[2:00:12] have overcome them because greater is he
[2:00:15] that is in you than he that is in the
[2:00:18] world you overcome because of him in you
[2:00:23] he that is in you is the Overcomer
[2:00:27] Hallelujah huj now we say well Lord how
[2:00:29] I'm going to overcome this is what been
[2:00:32] this is what I
[2:00:34] felt what was
[2:00:36] hiding in the
[2:00:39] message Hallelujah the way of a true
[2:00:43] Prophet the way of a true
[2:00:46] prophet and that's in 62 and I'm I'm
[2:00:50] closing on this because the five foolish
[2:00:53] the five wise version moved in
[2:00:56] desperation Hallelujah and they all
[2:00:59] trimmed their
[2:01:01] lamps Hallelujah but that wise kept her
[2:01:06] eyes on the door and that door is Jesus
[2:01:10] Christ now listen what brother bam says
[2:01:14] and I'm closing with this in this way of
[2:01:17] of a true
[2:01:18] prophet in paragraphs
[2:01:20] 138 he said I do believe some of y'all
[2:01:25] going I trust everybody hear it he said
[2:01:28] I do believe in
[2:01:30] per but I believe it but I believe it's
[2:01:33] right
[2:01:34] now he said you purge your own
[2:01:40] soul Purgatory means to
[2:01:44] purge when you
[2:01:46] see done something
[2:01:49] wrong get out there
[2:01:52] and clean it out of
[2:01:55] You by
[2:01:57] confession
[2:01:59] crying fasting and
[2:02:03] praying I'm not done yet because some of
[2:02:06] us perhaps has never
[2:02:09] fasted don't know how to
[2:02:11] cry Hallelujah but that's what he said
[2:02:14] get out there and clean it
[2:02:16] out you clean it
[2:02:18] out by
[2:02:20] confession C
[2:02:23] fasting and praying hallelujah
[2:02:26] hallelujah someone even laughed at
[2:02:29] me when the Lord came here not long ago
[2:02:33] and give me a
[2:02:34] vision I always wanted to see about
[2:02:39] binding that
[2:02:41] serpent listen to what he's saying I
[2:02:44] always wanted to see about binding that
[2:02:48] serpent I always wondered how to
[2:02:53] I would step out like
[2:02:55] that when that's what I wanted all my
[2:03:00] life then I began to fast and
[2:03:04] pray and said what what would you do
[2:03:08] that
[2:03:10] for I said in there he said I was not
[2:03:15] sincere
[2:03:18] enough after
[2:03:20] he wanted to purge
[2:03:24] myself not wait till you
[2:03:26] die and let some priest try to purge
[2:03:30] you he said Purge your
[2:03:35] souls now the this is a message that's
[2:03:38] to
[2:03:39] you it's a message to me you're not
[2:03:43] sincere
[2:03:45] enough and those demons ain't going
[2:03:49] nowhere if the prophet of God had to do
[2:03:51] it
[2:03:53] you got to do
[2:03:54] it hallelujah hallelujah yes sir this is
[2:03:57] a serious
[2:04:00] time partially is not
[2:04:07] godly if you're going to do this
[2:04:09] Christianity
[2:04:11] partially that's not that's not God you
[2:04:13] can't do it you can't have a half sheep
[2:04:16] and a half
[2:04:18] goat going to for look what Adam said
[2:04:22] here and I'm closing this my last
[2:04:24] one the way of a true Prophet look what
[2:04:26] he said especially when we take up for
[2:04:29] each other and you know others are wrong
[2:04:31] and you cover their
[2:04:33] sin you protect
[2:04:35] them you know they're
[2:04:38] wrong listen what he
[2:04:40] says I I took up for a man one
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] time when I should not have took
[2:04:50] up
[2:04:52] I could have just shooked the liver out
[2:04:54] of
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:05:03] him see instead of doing
[2:05:07] it I had to pay for
[2:05:11] it God made him pay
[2:05:16] for because when you protect someone
[2:05:19] that's willfully sitting and doing
[2:05:24] you have become one with them and you're
[2:05:27] going to pay for
[2:05:28] it but that's my friend go to hell with
[2:05:31] your
[2:05:35] friend did did you say it like I said it
[2:05:41] okay cuz you know that's what people
[2:05:43] don't
[2:05:44] understand you don't go to hell and get
[2:05:46] out of
[2:05:47] it there is no mercy there is no Grace
[2:05:52] let me say it like this there is no
[2:05:55] friend no
[2:05:57] one on this Earth I'm going to wait I'm
[2:06:01] going to risk my
[2:06:03] soul Hallelujah because if I go to hell

[2:06:07] help me and I can't help
[2:06:12] them y'all y'all y'all y'all car on like
[2:06:15] I use profanity and y'all do it all the
[2:06:20] time
[2:06:23] y'all getting quiet I know some of y'all
[2:06:26] I done heard some of y'all

[2:07:19] that ring on
[2:07:20] me the foundation of the
[2:07:22] world and the way people think about you
