[30:16] &gt;&gt; And I know that you're you're going to
[30:19] be blessed
[30:20] &gt;&gt; uh through his ministry. I expected more
[30:24] to be here.
[30:26] But everybody is here are those who were
[30:28] ordained to be so.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; So we thank you for your prayers when we
[30:36] were there in Arizona.
[30:38] It was absolutely wonderful.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Uh we saw God do great things.
[30:45] Different different people were healed
[30:47] instantly.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Uh the message or the word was powerful
[30:52] &gt;&gt; and I'll never be the same.
[30:56] And that's the way I love the word. I
[30:58] love it when the word do those things
[31:00] for me.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Change me and take me to another level
[31:05] &gt;&gt; in understanding and revelation
[31:08] &gt;&gt; because that's what it's all about
[31:09] tonight. It's not how good or how
[31:12] dramatically a man can preach.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; It's about the truth.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; And if we can receive the truth,
[31:20] &gt;&gt; we can see Christ. We can receive the
[31:22] word. And
[31:25] thereby grow
[31:26] &gt;&gt; into his very image and likeness. I'm
[31:28] not the preacher. [laughter]
[31:32] &gt;&gt; So anyway, brother Danny, would you come
[31:33] and and have have free course how the
[31:37] Lord would lead you, sir?
[31:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Isaiah
[32:04] So appreciate
[32:20] John Simon.
[32:22] enjoyed
[32:24] being here with you
[32:29] &gt;&gt; and um it was uh
[32:33] I guess about 20 I'm going to say about
[32:36] 27 years ago
[32:39] &gt;&gt; we first met brother Isaiah
[32:42] we were holding an outreach
[32:45] &gt;&gt; in Hamilton Ontario
[32:47] &gt;&gt; and brother Isaiah along with the La
[32:50] Fontaine family had been invited
[32:54] and minister and
[32:57] I had no idea the gift that was laying
[33:00] in brother Isaiah.
[33:02] I was playing guitar at the time for the
[33:05] church band and bus.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; I felt like a like a like a band
[33:09] celebrity playing for
[33:13] &gt;&gt; when I heard him sing I said glory.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; But you know what? made the right choice
[33:20] when he decided to get he could have
[33:21] been a superstar but he gave his gift
[33:24] unto the Lord
[33:26] and here you are today the beneficiary
[33:32] I understand he's been in the ministry
[33:34] now since 1984 85
[33:39] this message
[33:41] glorious word that we feed upon and that
[33:43] we're so blessed
[33:45] &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour.
[33:48] Amen. I um uh was recently uh placed as
[33:52] the pastor.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Our precious brother John Simon retired
[33:59] retired. He's still quite active. He's
[34:00] actually going to be preaching tomorrow
[34:02] morning
[34:04] um back home. But um you got to forgive
[34:06] me for the you know I'm just a young
[34:08] pastor.
[34:11] So, I just trust that, you know, I'm
[34:12] just going to deliver what's on my heart
[34:15] and I trust that, you know, that you
[34:16] will receive the blessing
[34:19] and that it would uh have an effect on
[34:21] you today.
[34:23] Amen. Praise God.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; And so, um, let's just have a word of
[34:27] prayer and then we're going to go to the
[34:28] word.
[34:31] Father,
[34:32] what a privilege this evening, Lord,
[34:35] &gt;&gt; that we can assemble under the
[34:37] revelation
[34:40] that gives us
[34:42] to speak your word
[34:44] season, Father.
[34:47] There are still sons and daughters of
[34:49] God,
[34:52] Father, that need to hear you.
[34:56] All of them in this day and in this
[34:58] hour, bring them into their
[35:01] physicians as sons and daughters.
[35:05] And tonight we're here as senators
[35:09] asking that Lord that you would break,
[35:13] give ears to him
[35:16] to speak your word tonight.
[35:18] We're just human vessels, Father, but
[35:21] we've come into the uh liberty of
[35:25] daughters of God. So we can rejoice
[35:27] around
[35:30] Have your way. Have your liberty. And
[35:33] bless your people now.
[35:36] Give ourselves to your service.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Bless this ministry. Lord, continue to
[35:43] prosper. Our precious brother
[35:48] Jesus Christ.
[35:50] Amen. And amen. Praise God. Glor.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; So, we've been uh ministering for the
[35:56] last um you can put up the uh the first
[35:58] slide.
[35:59] Um we've been ministering a series
[36:04] &gt;&gt; over the last 10 weeks or so or maybe
[36:08] months and um it's it's a series on the
[36:12] purpose of God
[36:14] and it was based on uh you know being
[36:17] called unto adoption.
[36:20] And so tonight, I'm just trusting that,
[36:23] you know, I can bring um you know, uh
[36:26] kind of like a
[36:28] &gt;&gt; um
[36:29] a
[36:31] synopsis.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; of of uh you know, what the Lord has
[36:36] laid upon my heart,
[36:38] you know, services that that we've been
[36:40] ministering back home. And I'm trusting
[36:42] that, you know, that the Lord would just
[36:44] uh take the word and just speak to your
[36:47] individual needs and meet your needs. in
[36:50] the midst of it all because this is what
[36:53] has called us. This is what has given us
[36:56] the revelation to serve God is when we
[36:59] hear lip to ear from God that he speaks
[37:01] to our needs and and gives us uh you
[37:04] know what we have need of. Amen. To
[37:07] overcome in the age that we're living
[37:09] in. Amen. There's a portion of word that
[37:12] God has for you that gives you the
[37:15] ability to overcome in this particular
[37:18] age. Praise God. And so we want to take
[37:21] a look at that. We're going to read our
[37:22] scripture
[37:23] &gt;&gt; from Ephesians 1 9-11.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says here, "Having made known
[37:30] unto us the mystery of his will
[37:35] according to his good pleasure,
[37:38] which he hath purposed in himself, that
[37:41] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[37:44] times, he might gather together in one
[37:48] in one
[37:50] all things in Christ." Amen. both which
[37:54] are in heaven and which are on earth
[37:58] in him.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; In whom also, now this is what we want
[38:03] to focus on today.
[38:05] In whom also we have obtained an
[38:08] inheritance.
[38:10] Amen. Praise God. Being predestinated
[38:14] according to the purpose of his workketh
[38:17] all things
[38:20] of his own will.
[38:23] Amen. You may be seated. God bless you.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Um, and so you can go to the next slide.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; And so we're going to be looking at
[38:36] obtaining our inheritance. In the
[38:38] scripture we just read, it talks about
[38:41] in whom. So in Christ,
[38:44] &gt;&gt; we have an inheritance waiting for us.
[38:47] Amen. And we want to, you know, we want
[38:50] to understand this inheritance. Praise
[38:52] God. You know, I I'm a son. I belong to
[38:54] a family. I've got a father.
[38:58] You know, in order for me to know that
[38:59] I've got an inheritance, I need to see
[39:02] my name on the way.
[39:04] I need to know that my name
[39:09] has an inheritance.
[39:11] Book of
[39:13] God. our names written
[39:17] are ordained.
[39:20] And so by the preaching of the word
[39:25] revelation of this,
[39:27] we get to hear if our names are
[39:31] because when you
[39:35] recognize that
[39:38] you can recognize
[39:40] the word
[39:42] ordained for every
[39:45] Say amen to that
[39:48] inheritance
[39:51] from the book.
[39:54] Praise God. Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so Paul's speaking here.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; We know that this is um you know a type
[40:03] of
[40:05] &gt;&gt; the actual uh Ephesians is a type of the
[40:08] book of Joshua.
[40:16] speaking to us in this
[40:18] Joshua has listen
[40:21] and listen to brother
[40:25] talking about Joshua
[40:28] sons and daughters
[40:31] into their maturity
[40:34] praise God
[40:36] Joshua came out the ministry of Moses
[40:41] Exodus
[40:43] It was
[40:48] a glory to God. Moses did not them into
[40:52] the promised land.
[40:55] But Moses told them
[41:01] that that that Joshua would be a
[41:04] them in
[41:07] glory. The land was promised to them.
[41:11] promise
[41:13] to Abraham
[41:20] and maker is God
[41:23] inheritance that Abraham will
[41:27] still waiting on that
[41:29] just like you and I are waiting
[41:32] in order for us to see that
[41:36] we have to experience
[41:40] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glory to you.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; And so this four-part series on
[41:46] adoption, it encompasses the entire
[41:50] of redemption.
[41:54] Go back to that series
[42:00] and that pertains to you.
[42:04] Amen. Praise God. Glory to God.
[42:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the adoption,
[42:09] we're not talking about an adoption here
[42:11] like in a national
[42:16] individuals that wedlock and that child
[42:19] is put up and somebody takes that
[42:22] adoption
[42:24] adoption
[42:26] here.
[42:28] We're looking at a sexual adoption,
[42:31] spiritual adoption. Amen. Where a father
[42:35] back in the Old Testament
[42:37] Father inheritance
[42:41] because he was placing that son
[42:45] place.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was given that son
[42:50] and he said
[42:53] he
[42:59] devil out of your
[43:02] certain life
[43:05] to do so.
[43:07] Amen. As an adopted son of God. Amen.
[43:11] Hallelujah.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; So, what is the Lord doing? He's
[43:15] perfecting. He's bringing sons into
[43:18] adoption. He's giving them an
[43:21] experience. They know they have a
[43:23] father. Not just a a regular father,
[43:27] a holy father,
[43:29] a heavenly father
[43:32] that's going to give us an inheritance.
[43:36] never thought.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Let's read our first quote here from
[43:41] Brother and you'll see that most of
[43:43] these quotes come from the series on
[43:46] adoption.
[43:48] He says, "Look,
[43:54] now a little farther now.
[43:57] Now the 11th verse
[44:00] &gt;&gt; from the scriptures that we read that we
[44:02] read. In whom also we have obtained an
[44:06] inheritance.
[44:08] An inheritance. Somebody has to leave
[44:11] you something to inherit. Is that right?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; An inheritance. What inheritance do we
[44:18] have? What inheritance did I have?
[44:22] I didn't have any. But God left me an
[44:26] inheritance. But he put my name
[44:32] found.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is not some inheritance
[44:37] that just decided to write up
[44:43] before the foundation.
[44:46] Oh, you say now wait a minute. Jesus did
[44:49] that when he died.
[44:52] He never Jesus.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus come to purchase that inheritance
[44:58] for me.
[45:02] Every next verse he says the next verse
[45:06] we also have obtained
[45:10] an inheritance
[45:12] predestinated
[45:14] to the purpose of him
[45:17] all things after the counsel of his own.
[45:22] Glory to God. I'm glad
[45:28] and that he thought of me
[45:32] saw you in
[45:35] so that you would be received
[45:38] in this hour
[45:40] into a mature
[45:43] bring you into an adoption
[45:46] that you would receive an inheritance
[45:49] of your God. Listen, he goes on to say
[45:51] here in the next quote, he says, "Look,
[45:54] has predestinated us unto this
[45:57] inheritance.
[45:58] If I'm right, inheritance of something,
[46:02] God is knocking at my heart and saying,
[46:06] I called you a long time ago before the
[46:10] foundations of preach the gospel. I have
[46:13] an inheritance, an inheritance of
[46:16] eternal life."
[46:18] sent Jesus
[46:21] that inheritance
[46:23] to me.
[46:26] Listen, they want to they want to accept
[46:28] Buddha. They want
[46:30] Muhammad and all kinds of other people.
[46:35] Unless you accept Jesus Christ,
[46:39] there is absolutely no inheritance.
[46:42] Amen. How could there be an inheritance
[46:46] that is corruptible?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the only one that came
[46:54] and resurrected.
[46:56] Amen. And when I receive the Holy Ghost,
[46:59] he makes it real to me.
[47:02] I really truly got an inheritance.
[47:05] It's only when he he come and make it
[47:07] real
[47:09] God. Amen. He says because there was
[47:11] nothing to God.
[47:13] to inherit it. It was
[47:16] valid. There was nothing I could do.
[47:23] God sent in his good time.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus the
[47:29] slain from the foundations of the world.
[47:32] Hallelujah.
[47:34] It means so much more to the sons of
[47:36] God. Amen.
[47:39] Because that lamb
[47:44] take the book of inheritance
[47:48] and bring it in.
[47:52] He took that l that lamb. He one that
[47:55] could loose
[47:59] your name in there.
[48:01] You had an inheritance.
[48:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Jesus the lamb
[48:07] slain from the foundation.
[48:12] to my inheritance
[48:16] to be what?
[48:18] What inheritance? He said the sunship
[48:23] to be a son of God.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; We are living in the days of the
[48:31] manifestation
[48:33] of God. Amen. And this revelation of
[48:37] adoption
[48:39] and the inheritance
[48:40] is sealed up sons and daughters of
[48:45] manifest the word.
[48:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Unless we
[48:50] manifest the word.
[48:53] That's why the earth's groaning
[48:55] groaning for the manifestation of
[49:00] the revelation
[49:02] &gt;&gt; of the rapture.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God forever more.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Excuse me for getting a
[49:16] little excited, but this word, this this
[49:19] word is a reality. Amen. Hallelujah. The
[49:23] purpose of his first coming to the earth
[49:26] was to show that there was actually an
[49:29] invisible God that could become the word
[49:32] made.
[49:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; His desire was always to be the word
[49:38] made flesh. When he listen when he made
[49:41] Adam, he made Adam image.
[49:44] God on earth in a man
[49:47] in a man. Amen. Praise God. Jesus came
[49:50] to earth in order to declare a father.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know what sunship is.
[49:58] How you going to know that you're a son
[49:59] unless you know you've got a father?
[50:03] How could you possibly know that you're
[50:05] a son
[50:07] without knowing the father?
[50:10] &gt;&gt; We could never have become conscious of
[50:12] being a son without
[50:14] that God had a purpose in coming to the
[50:18] earth
[50:20] and becoming word made flesh. Amen.
[50:24] Hallelujah. Glory to God. You see,
[50:26] that's the mystery that's been sealed up
[50:28] from the foundation of
[50:31] And we're and we're blessed because God
[50:33] has sent us a prophet.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; That that in the days of the voice of
[50:39] the angel
[50:42] of God when he begins to sound
[50:45] there was going to be the mystery
[50:49] mysteries
[50:51] mysteries. Listen there's a lot of
[50:53] history
[50:55] that we all know about which is the
[50:57] church age mysteries and the mystery of
[50:59] iniquity.
[51:01] mystery of the godhead
[51:08] all
[51:10] mystery
[51:12] that goes beyond all of that.
[51:15] This is what his purpose was in coming
[51:17] to the earth.
[51:20] Hallelujah. Which was the mystery of
[51:21] God.
[51:23] God could
[51:29] &gt;&gt; listen Romans chapter 6 or
[51:32] &gt;&gt; sorry, Romans chapter 8,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; he says, "For as many as are led by the
[51:38] spirit of God," Amen. They are the sons
[51:41] of God.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. For ye have not received the
[51:46] spirit of bondage again to fear,
[51:48] &gt;&gt; but ye have received the spirit of
[51:51] adoption. Here it is again.
[51:55] You've received something in you that is
[51:58] going to lead you into a position
[52:02] of authority here on the earth.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. The spirit
[52:08] itself bears witness with our spirit.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; What spirit? The Holy Ghost.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. What we've got in
[52:20] this hour.
[52:22] Not not just a baptism of the Holy
[52:24] Ghost.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like the baptism of the Holy
[52:27] Ghost. I
[52:30] &gt;&gt; We need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:32] from time to time because it anoints us
[52:35] and it anoints us to lay hands on the
[52:37] sick
[52:39] to to pray for those that need
[52:41] deliverance. Amen. But but this hour
[52:45] produces the Holy Ghost himself.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. which is God in you,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, your hope of glory,
[52:57] your inheritance.
[53:00] There's no inheritance without the Holy
[53:02] Ghost.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You know, look, you just go back and and
[53:05] and you know when when when John the
[53:08] Baptist came to the earth, he introduced
[53:10] Jesus Christ.
[53:13] Amen. But notice that after after Christ
[53:17] had had died and resurrected, Amen,
[53:21] Paul, the same one that wrote the book
[53:24] of Ephesians here, the same one that's
[53:26] talking to the Romans. Amen. He come
[53:29] across a bunch of disciples one day.
[53:33] He saw they were praising Jesus. He saw
[53:36] they were praising God. But he asked him
[53:38] a question. He said, "How did you
[53:39] receive the Holy Ghost?"
[53:42] Come on now.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; They needed to recognize
[53:46] that the Holy Ghost had to come. They
[53:49] said, "We
[53:51] we've been uh baptized underapt."
[54:03] And that was the revealed.
[54:08] They were actually given the message of
[54:10] the hour.
[54:13] You know, there's a lot of people to be
[54:16] asked the same question
[54:19] if you receive the Holy Ghost.
[54:24] Oh my goodness. There's a lot of people
[54:28] who don't realize when the Holy Ghost
[54:30] comes,
[54:32] your life doesn't remain the same. It
[54:36] changes.
[54:38] God takes control.
[54:40] It it it takes it takes a hold of your
[54:43] desires.
[54:45] Your desires change.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; You you don't think the same way. Your
[54:50] your purpose is changed. I was telling
[54:52] the sister tonight, I was saying, you

[55:11] the element of the message of the hour
[55:14] because when it comes in you, it changes
[55:17] your desires.
[55:20] You got the Holy Ghost as a person."
[55:23] There's no way you're going to say, "I'm
[55:24] going to California so I can
[55:29] The Holy Ghost ain't going to ever leave
[55:31] you to California to be a movie star or
[55:35] to be a fashion designer." Amen. We're
[55:38] talking about the reality of God. You

[57:21] are not worthy to be compared with the
[57:23] glory which shall be revealed in us.

[1:00:33] mental attitude sermon on the word of
[1:00:36] God." That's not why I'm here. I want to

[1:00:41] of what it is to be a son of God, to be
[1:00:44] a daughter of God. Amen. in the age that

[1:01:55] the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[1:01:59] spake unto Joshua the son of Nun Moses
[1:02:04] minister, saying my servant is dead.

[1:02:41] your life right now in 2025,

[1:02:52] He's telling you he's given you as a
[1:02:54] son. As an adopted son, you've got
[1:02:58] authority over these things.
[1:03:01] He says, he says, "Every place that the
[1:03:03] soul of your foot shall tread upon, that
[1:03:06] have I given unto you, as I said unto
[1:03:11] Lebanon, even unto the great river, the
[1:03:14] river Euphrates, the land of the
[1:03:16] Hittites, the great sea, towards the
[1:03:19] going down of the sun shall be on your
[1:03:21] coast. There shall not any man be able
[1:03:24] to stand before thee
[1:03:27] all the days of thine life. As I was
[1:03:30] with brother and Moses,
[1:03:34] I will be with thee,
[1:03:39] nor forsake thee. Be strong and
[1:03:42] courageous.

[1:03:59] inheritance. Amen. You're interested in
[1:04:01] your inheritance. Amen. I want my
[1:04:04] inheritance. Praise God. I want to know
[1:04:06] what it's all about. Amen. Go to the
[1:04:08] next slide. He says here, "But only be
[1:04:11] strong."
[1:04:14] He's reminding us here. Only be strong,
[1:04:17] very courageous.
[1:04:19] You're going to need to be very
[1:04:21] courageous. Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That thou mayest observe to do all
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; which Moses my servant commanded thee.
[1:04:31] Turn not from it to the right hand or to
[1:04:33] the left. Thou mayest prosper
[1:04:36] whethersoever thou goest. The book of
[1:04:39] the law. Hallelujah. Shall not depart
[1:04:42] out of thy.

[1:04:55] observe to do according to all that is
[1:04:57] written therein. For then thou shalt
[1:05:00] make thy way prosperous,
[1:05:03] and then thou shalt have good success.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to go to the next slide. He
[1:05:10] says here in in verse 9 to 11, have I
[1:05:13] commanded thee? Look, he's fighting us
[1:05:15] again to be strong.
[1:05:18] It's not easy to run a
[1:05:21] to run a church to be
[1:05:24] to have leadership in the church.
[1:05:27] You need to be courageous to
[1:05:30] praise God. He says, "But be strong,
[1:05:33] courage, not afraid, neither be thou
[1:05:36] dismayed.
[1:05:38] God is with
[1:05:42] you.

[1:06:11] you possess.
[1:06:13] We're under another Ephesians. We're
[1:06:16] under the leadership of Joshua himself.
[1:06:22] He's telling He's telling
[1:06:24] you to prepare yourselves.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Prepare yourselves because we're going
[1:06:31] to take our inheritance.
[1:06:34] Listen, we're by the time we're done
[1:06:37] tomorrow's service, we're going to
[1:06:39] understand
[1:06:41] what being a son is. We're going to have
[1:06:44] a level of confidence
[1:06:46] to be able to look at the enemy's eye
[1:06:50] as a son of God. Amen. With an
[1:06:55] revealed
[1:06:57] because it's been given
[1:07:00] he says here, go to the next slide. He
[1:07:02] says here, our Ephesians,
[1:07:04] our Joshua, which is the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Joshua means our savior.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; It's always him.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Don't be looking for anything else.
[1:07:18] Know that it's Jesus Christ, the savior.
[1:07:22] It's just it's just him in different.
[1:07:27] always been him from the beginning.
[1:07:30] Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Joshua means the Holy Spirit
[1:07:33] representing it.
[1:07:37] He was in the natural
[1:07:39] that he is our great warrior. He's our
[1:07:42] great leader. As God was with Joshua,
[1:07:47] so is God in the Holy Spirit
[1:07:51] us about.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; You see how these scriptures, they just
[1:07:55] keep coming.
[1:07:57] Amen. When when when you recognize
[1:08:01] that as a word that that's that's
[1:08:02] ordained
[1:08:05] as an attribute of God,
[1:08:08] you were in the mind of God.
[1:08:12] We came into this,
[1:08:15] but he knew you'd be here. knew that you
[1:08:18] would recognize. You knew that the
[1:08:20] minute that he watered you with his
[1:08:22] spirit that there be an attribute that
[1:08:25] would come to life and recognize its
[1:08:28] position.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:34] the son of Dominic
[1:08:39] of of Ella
[1:08:42] what brother Brandham was talking about
[1:08:45] that he had
[1:08:48] You know that you're not a son
[1:08:53] of eternity.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Go to the next
[1:08:58] uh slide there. He says positionally
[1:09:01] placing the church where they belong.
[1:09:06] Each one, every single one of you,
[1:09:08] you've got an inheritance. You've got a
[1:09:11] position in this church.
[1:09:13] You're here under this pastor. It's
[1:09:16] because God has placed you here
[1:09:19] position in this.
[1:09:21] You're not here to just warm the truth.
[1:09:25] They're going to hear about your name
[1:09:26] and
[1:09:29] you got an inheritance
[1:09:32] comes
[1:09:35] in position
[1:09:38] on the audio.
[1:09:43] God has God has anointed you with the
[1:09:46] ability
[1:09:48] to play his attributes
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; as an inherited son of God.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; This is not play church.
[1:10:00] We're not just joining church.
[1:10:04] And when you look around and you see the
[1:10:06] churches is not so full,
[1:10:09] I think that's strange.
[1:10:11] When Jesus Christ was on the earth,
[1:10:14] there was only a few that could that
[1:10:16] could perceive what we're talking about.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; If you're looking to fill the church,
[1:10:22] it's because you're compromising the
[1:10:24] word.
[1:10:25] People need to know what the word,
[1:10:29] you need to know that God is.
[1:10:32] If there's sin in your life, you got to
[1:10:34] get it out.
[1:10:37] That's one of the things about being a
[1:10:39] son.
[1:10:41] Hallelujah. We're going to look at that
[1:10:42] a little bit.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And he says, "God has adopted us sons.
[1:10:48] We are sons by birth
[1:10:51] adopted positionally placed by the Holy
[1:10:54] Spirit.
[1:10:58] They they were everyone Hebrews. When
[1:11:01] they crossed the river,
[1:11:03] Joshua divided them
[1:11:06] into one.
[1:11:10] utterance of his mother birth where
[1:11:14] spirit
[1:11:19] scripture just just to tell that women

[1:11:46] inspiration

[1:12:31] you've been bound by a spirit in this
[1:12:34] world that bounds
[1:12:36] by a Roman system
[1:12:39] that that's that's taken the word tried
[1:12:42] to put their own interpretation on
[1:12:46] this word comes
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; under the anointing of
[1:12:51] that has received his position
[1:12:54] and that utterance comes out of his
[1:12:56] mouth because your name is being called
[1:13:01] supernaturally
[1:13:03] your position as a son or a
[1:13:08] This goes beyond church.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural placing, sons of
[1:13:16] God. Amen.

[1:13:27] given a ministry. You've been given a
[1:13:29] position. It's up to you now. What are
[1:13:32] you going to plant? What kind of seed
[1:13:34] are you going to plant?
[1:13:36] told them that that that they could
[1:13:38] receive the land
[1:13:40] of the land. They could bless the land
[1:13:43] in there. They would eat from that
[1:13:48] in your land.
[1:13:51] What are you planting?
[1:13:53] What what is your ministry producing?
[1:13:57] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adoption gives you an inheritance.
[1:14:02] What inheritance? But with every
[1:14:04] inheritance comes the the responsibility
[1:14:07] to take possession
[1:14:10] position.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Listen. Go to the go to the next quote
[1:14:18] here.
[1:14:21] Slide 13. It says here God told them way
[1:14:25] down in Egypt,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; I give you that land.
[1:14:30] But he didn't say, "I'll go out there
[1:14:32] and sweep it all out and garnish the
[1:14:35] houses and hang up the curtains and
[1:14:37] everything. You all just move in." No,
[1:14:40] no, no. They had to fight for every inch
[1:14:43] of God
[1:14:47] that this is just going to be
[1:14:50] if you're going to stand
[1:14:53] and you're going to believe the word for
[1:14:54] your day
[1:14:57] in control of your life
[1:15:01] and and the devil ain't going to like
[1:15:06] your friends aren't going to like you.
[1:15:08] Your family's not going to like you.
[1:15:11] They're going to oppose you all the way.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he says here, he says,
[1:15:17] "You all just move in." No, no. They had
[1:15:19] to fight for every inch
[1:15:22] fighting and take it by every fight,
[1:15:24] every inch. He said, "Everywhere the
[1:15:27] souls of your foot are
[1:15:32] glory to God. Footsteps is possession.
[1:15:35] That's the same thing it is today. The
[1:15:38] healing belongs to us
[1:15:42] that comes with your inheritance.
[1:15:45] The healing is yours. The spirit
[1:15:47] belongs.
[1:15:49] It's our property. You fight every inch
[1:15:53] of it. Yes.
[1:15:56] Footsteps is possession.
[1:15:59] He says just keep fighting.
[1:16:02] Take it. The devil say the days of
[1:16:05] miracle is passed.
[1:16:08] You got situations where miracles.
[1:16:11] I want you to know that an inherited son
[1:16:15] of God. Miracles is just an everyday
[1:16:19] occurrence.
[1:16:24] You don't you don't go into a situation
[1:16:26] where
[1:16:29] I wonder if God's going to
[1:16:33] heal.
[1:16:35] God is a miracle working.
[1:16:38] He doesn't do it according to your
[1:16:41] season.
[1:16:43] Your job is to
[1:16:48] possess the promises
[1:16:52] them in your life. Amen.
[1:16:55] But brother footsteps is possession.
[1:16:56] Just keep on fighting.
[1:16:59] You're a you're you're a liar. Say to
[1:17:02] Satan, you're a liar.
[1:17:04] God said he's the same yesterday and
[1:17:06] today
[1:17:08] get over everywhere your footsteps are
[1:17:13] remember what he said at the beginning
[1:17:17] be courageous
[1:17:20] don't be afraid to step out don't be
[1:17:22] afraid to go to school on
[1:17:27] being a a daughter or son of God
[1:17:32] Jesus
[1:17:33] It's not about going on corners and and
[1:17:35] dancing and and rebuking the people and
[1:17:38] telling the people they're going to
[1:17:40] hell. No, sir.
[1:17:43] Jesus Christ has come to give life.
[1:17:47] And that's the life that you're
[1:17:50] a real Christian
[1:17:55] people on earth.
[1:17:58] That's the problem with Christian.
[1:18:00] You lost your testimony
[1:18:03] to tell people.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You should listen. If you don't want to
[1:18:05] tell them anything, just tell them how
[1:18:07] happy you are to serve the Lord Jesus
[1:18:09] Christ
[1:18:11] about how much you benefit from serving
[1:18:14] God
[1:18:16] joy of the Lord. Did you have
[1:18:18] supernatural strength when you got the
[1:18:21] joy of God?
[1:18:23] When you praise God, do you think God
[1:18:26] needs praise?
[1:18:28] doesn't need praise. It's not a God
[1:18:31] that's just sitting there giving me
[1:18:32] praise.
[1:18:34] No. God wants you to be the happiest
[1:18:37] people.
[1:18:39] You got the joy of the Lord.
[1:18:42] Praise.
[1:18:44] You got the joy of God.
[1:18:48] What's coming out of your mouth
[1:18:52] God? Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; The reality of God.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Moses given them all the
[1:19:00] instructions how to dress the land, how
[1:19:02] to plant the land, how to rest the land,
[1:19:05] told them he told them not to mix
[1:19:09] the inhabitants of the land
[1:19:14] compromising
[1:19:16] your promises.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; You do not compromise.
[1:19:22] You are as an inherited son or daughter
[1:19:25] of God. Amen.
[1:19:27] You do not give them any portion of your
[1:19:29] land.
[1:19:32] That's your land. Hallelujah. You need
[1:19:35] to work your land. You need because as
[1:19:37] you work your land, you start to display
[1:19:41] the attribute of God. You start to
[1:19:46] how it is to overcome.
[1:19:48] You start to show that you're an
[1:19:49] overcomer. Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. The Lord said only
[1:19:54] be courageous. Now you can recall from
[1:19:57] the scriptures that when the children of
[1:19:59] Israel
[1:20:02] and his armies that the people would
[1:20:04] hold up Moses's arms as long as they
[1:20:07] held up
[1:20:11] over the enemy.
[1:20:14] But did you remember what he said? He
[1:20:15] says, "My servant Moses is here."
[1:20:18] It's not about just raising up the dead
[1:20:21] and saying, "This is the only way. This
[1:20:24] is the only way you're going to
[1:20:25] overcome.
[1:20:27] You're going to win the battle." No, no,
[1:20:29] no, no, no, no. It's not that. Now
[1:20:32] Joshua is telling you that you need to
[1:20:35] possess
[1:20:37] to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:40] Brenam was the first wife,
[1:20:43] the fullness of the word.
[1:20:48] Father had the
[1:20:54] Amen. The only way that you're going to
[1:20:59] the Lord to be an overcomer
[1:21:05] life
[1:21:07] need to have.
[1:21:11] It's got to be Christ in you.
[1:21:14] food.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Listen here. Watch. Watch
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Joshua.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; He He Joshua had come into his
[1:21:26] inheritance.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; He had come into his understanding of
[1:21:30] what God had told him to do. He says,
[1:21:32] "Just be courageous. I'll be with you.
[1:21:35] I'll be with you every step of the way."
[1:21:37] Let's read the next scripture here.
[1:21:40] He says, "So Joshua descended from
[1:21:43] Gilgal, he and all the people of war
[1:21:45] with him and all the mighty men of
[1:21:48] valor. And the Lord said unto Joshua,
[1:21:50] fear them not. I have delivered them
[1:21:53] into thine hand." Listen, I don't care
[1:21:56] what situation you're facing right now.
[1:21:59] If you believe God, he's already
[1:22:02] delivered it into your hand as a son or
[1:22:05] daughter of God.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the Lord
[1:22:08] said unto Joshua, he says, he says,
[1:22:11] "There shall not a man of them stand
[1:22:14] before thee." Joshua before therefore
[1:22:18] came unto them suddenly and went up from
[1:22:22] Gilgal all night. Now pay attention
[1:22:24] here. Joshua knew that God was with him.
[1:22:28] And what is God doing now?
[1:22:32] has comforted them before Israel
[1:22:36] slaughter
[1:22:40] along the way
[1:22:42] to Beth
[1:22:44] to
[1:22:47] unto
[1:22:51] fighting the battle with them.
[1:22:54] Who was overcoming with them?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, you got to overcome. Yes, you got
[1:23:00] But God is there with you. He's with
[1:23:03] you.
[1:23:05] He He's discomforted your enemies
[1:23:09] because you've accepted your your
[1:23:11] adoption. You've accepted your position.
[1:23:15] You know that God is with you. He's
[1:23:17] going to fight with you.
[1:23:20] Stay with the word.
[1:23:22] As long as you stay with your position.
[1:23:25] Goes on next next uh uh scripture.
[1:23:29] And it came to pass as they fled from
[1:23:32] before Israel and were in the going down
[1:23:34] to God
[1:23:36] that the Lord cast down stones from
[1:23:39] heaven upon them and unto Azeka and they
[1:23:44] died. Now pay attention. They were more
[1:23:47] which died with hailstones than they
[1:23:49] whom the children of Israel saw.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you're in the midst
[1:23:55] of a battle and you're fighting through
[1:23:57] the battles, all of a sudden there's God
[1:24:00] is throwing
[1:24:02] the enemy because because there's an
[1:24:04] enemy trying to come in from this side
[1:24:06] over here. Stay focused with the word.
[1:24:11] Stay with your thoughts. The word of God
[1:24:13] that's leading you direct
[1:24:16] stone comes in this enemy. sent that
[1:24:19] enemy
[1:24:22] and and there was more
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; that died
[1:24:26] from God's hailstones
[1:24:29] that you had to deal with.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And here now we're looking at adoption.
[1:24:40] We're looking at a son. We're looking at
[1:24:42] here at a type of Joshua who's coming
[1:24:45] into his position. He's trusting God.
[1:24:48] Are you trusting God tonight? Are you
[1:24:51] believing that you can stand as a
[1:24:53] daughter or as a son?
[1:24:55] He's going to be with you.
[1:24:58] God, look what he says here. He says in
[1:25:02] Joshua 10
[1:25:04] verse 12 to 14. Then spake Joshua to the
[1:25:06] Lord. You've got a relationship with the
[1:25:09] Lord.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I'll tell you, when
[1:25:13] you get to a place where you're walking
[1:25:15] with God,
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; you've got God on your side, you've seen
[1:25:20] some victories in your life, you know
[1:25:23] that God is fighting some battles for
[1:25:25] you.
[1:25:27] I was telling the sister, I said, God
[1:25:29] will vindicate it. When you receive the
[1:25:32] Holy Ghost in your life, God will show
[1:25:35] you things. God will make it real to you
[1:25:39] that that he will overcome whatever
[1:25:42] you're facing. Amen. And you get to a
[1:25:45] place like Joshua where he's got to
[1:25:46] release
[1:25:49] the Lord in the day delivery
[1:25:53] of Israel in the sight of Israel
[1:25:58] stand.
[1:26:01] And thou moon
[1:26:04] stood still
[1:26:09] avenged.
[1:26:13] Not this written in
[1:26:17] still
[1:26:20] not to go.
[1:26:24] And there was no day like
[1:26:27] or after
[1:26:30] hearkens
[1:26:32] of a man.
[1:26:35] Did he say a man?
[1:26:37] You mean you mean as as a son or a
[1:26:39] daughter of God?
[1:26:42] give you the spoken word
[1:26:45] in you that this is what the
[1:26:47] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're not just
[1:26:54] playing church
[1:26:57] down the road. Now, saints, you're not
[1:26:59] going to get this kind of this kind of
[1:27:02] inspiration just
[1:27:06] to be under the leadership of the Holy
[1:27:07] Ghost.
[1:27:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You need to
[1:27:11] listen. You The Holy Ghost interprets
[1:27:14] what was on the text. The Holy Ghost
[1:27:17] interprets the scriptures.
[1:27:19] Without the Holy Ghost, there is no
[1:27:21] interpretation.
[1:27:23] You're just another churchgoer.
[1:27:26] You're just another Christian
[1:27:28] that can overcome.
[1:27:32] You claim to be a Christian and the word
[1:27:34] is
[1:27:35] on the left side
[1:27:39] and claim to be a Christian.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; No sir, we promise you.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; The purpose of God will never bring you
[1:27:46] into that kind of a life.
[1:27:50] Praise God. You got a relationship. God
[1:27:52] wants you as a son to have the maturity
[1:27:57] on his behalf.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What? This is the hour that
[1:28:02] we're coming into.
[1:28:05] Listen, the Lord hearkened under the
[1:28:07] voice of a man. Why did he do that?
[1:28:11] Because Joshua believed the Lord. He
[1:28:14] believed that God was with him. He
[1:28:16] believed that God would not leave him
[1:28:18] nor forsake him
[1:28:20] an impossible situation in his life.
[1:28:23] You're going to face situations. God's
[1:28:26] going to put situations
[1:28:28] going to be impossible
[1:28:31] there so that you can
[1:28:34] things all
[1:28:38] catch the anointing of God.
[1:28:41] You speak
[1:28:45] experience
[1:28:47] as an adopted
[1:28:49] battles.
[1:28:52] You've seen God deal with situations in
[1:28:55] your life. Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Listen, he goes on here and read the
[1:28:58] next quote.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; But God did it anyhow.
[1:29:03] He says what?
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; By a man.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; not some great angel.
[1:29:20] Joshua knew he said, "I'm giving you
[1:29:25] I'm giving you your name.
[1:29:27] It's yours, sister."
[1:29:31] He believed it.
[1:29:33] And when you believe the word,
[1:29:36] that's why the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:29:38] himself.
[1:29:40] He's coming to his own word.
[1:29:43] cannot return for
[1:29:46] because you're now confessing it.
[1:29:49] Father will confess you
[1:29:53] will be with you. He will confirm the
[1:29:55] word.
[1:29:58] Not because you said so,
[1:30:00] but because he said, he promised.
[1:30:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A man with faith
[1:30:10] the land.
[1:30:11] The word of God was
[1:30:14] give you this land.
[1:30:17] The souls of your father.
[1:30:20] It's yours.
[1:30:22] The steps meant possession.
[1:30:26] The son is what? Achievement
[1:30:29] to do. See it was rooted.
[1:30:33] the sun would ever set them
[1:30:37] and back upon
[1:30:42] going down
[1:30:46] to do this.
[1:30:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You might come
[1:30:52] into a desperate situation.
[1:30:55] You trust God.
[1:30:57] No matter how the enemy looks to be
[1:30:59] surrounded
[1:31:02] stand on the promises of
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. Joshua had a purpose in his
[1:31:07] life to accomplish for God.
[1:31:11] The obstacle that God in he
[1:31:16] say to this mountain
[1:31:18] because the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:21] to overcome that situation
[1:31:24] situation's got to move
[1:31:27] because it's God's purpose.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; You're an adopted son. That's your
[1:31:35] inheritance.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to take it.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; But you see what ended up happening and
[1:31:42] what ends up happening sometimes with
[1:31:43] with us
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; because we're humans. We get weak
[1:31:46] sometimes.
[1:31:49] And in Judges chapter one
[1:31:51] verse 18 to 19 it says also Judah took
[1:31:54] Gaza with the coast thereof and with the
[1:31:58] coast thereof and Echron with the coast
[1:32:01] thereof. The Lord was
[1:32:04] and he drove out he drove he drove out
[1:32:07] all the inhabitants of the mountain but
[1:32:09] he could not drive out the inhabitants
[1:32:11] of the valley because they have
[1:32:14] of
[1:32:18] it doesn't matter what the enemy has.
[1:32:21] We're not to look at the enemies.
[1:32:28] Majority doesn't mean
[1:32:31] that that that you can't win.
[1:32:34] God has always been in a minority.
[1:32:38] God has always dealt with a few.
[1:32:41] He always uses the simple.
[1:32:43] God uses those that believe God. Just
[1:32:46] look at David. Listen, that Philistine,
[1:32:49] he comes, he says, "I'm going to take
[1:32:51] your head off. I'm going to feed you to
[1:32:53] the doctor
[1:32:56] because you challenge the living God.
[1:33:00] I come to you in the name of God,
[1:33:04] you can tell the enemy in the name of
[1:33:07] the Lord.
[1:33:10] In whatever situation,
[1:33:12] it doesn't matter how
[1:33:15] you say, I come in the name of the Lord.
[1:33:18] Hey, I'm going to raise their head.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; That's the authority of a son
[1:33:26] when they come into their position.
[1:33:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; But you see like today Israel allowed
[1:33:34] you know the enemy to come into their
[1:33:36] land. It even mentions Gaza right in the
[1:33:38] scripture.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; And what does the enemy do? He starts
[1:33:43] building tunnels. And that's why you got
[1:33:46] to be careful what you let into your
[1:33:47] home because the enemy is going to start
[1:33:50] to pour some tunnels under your bed. You
[1:33:54] know those you know those pornographic
[1:33:56] uh magazines? You got to be careful.
[1:33:59] They try to get they try to get buried
[1:34:01] into your into your under your bed and
[1:34:04] and and that's how the enemy works.
[1:34:06] Amen. Come on. We're talking about the
[1:34:08] realities here. We're talking we're
[1:34:10] talking how the enemy works. Amen. But
[1:34:13] we're not to compromise with the enemy.
[1:34:15] Oh, well, nobody nobody knows about it.
[1:34:18] Nobody knows because, you know, when I
[1:34:20] go to church, you know, I I'm there. I'm
[1:34:23] all dressed up. I look good. I say,
[1:34:24] "Praise the Lord." But then when I leave
[1:34:27] church, no, no, God knows all about it.
[1:34:30] And because that thing is sitting there,
[1:34:33] you're anointing your power to overcome
[1:34:36] your ability to to possess your sunship
[1:34:41] to combine the power of the enemy is.
[1:34:45] Why? Because you've made compromise with
[1:34:47] the enemy.
[1:34:49] Not to compromise with the enemy. You
[1:34:52] know that the children of Israel, they
[1:34:54] they went and made tributes. The Bible
[1:34:56] said, I you know, I don't have the
[1:34:57] scripture, but they went and made
[1:34:58] tributes.
[1:35:00] Okay? They were afraid of their big
[1:35:02] chariot. So, they said, "Listen, we're
[1:35:04] going to let you stay in the land, but
[1:35:06] we're still the boss. We're still the
[1:35:09] boss, but we're going to let you stay in
[1:35:11] the land as long as you as long as you
[1:35:14] do what we tell you. You think Satan is
[1:35:16] going to listen to you?
[1:35:19] You think he's just going to sit there
[1:35:22] in your in your social media?
[1:35:26] that you've got your password on that
[1:35:27] nobody else but you can
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; and you think that you're going to hide
[1:35:32] that.
[1:35:33] No, sir.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Amen. You don't make any You
[1:35:39] don't make any tributaries with the
[1:35:41] enemy. Amen. You You just fight. You
[1:35:45] continue to fight. When you feel you
[1:35:48] can't do anymore, just get back up and
[1:35:51] fight. You're going to see a boulder
[1:35:53] come from the left. comfort.
[1:35:57] Come from the front. God is going to
[1:35:59] fight your battles.
[1:36:02] Keep pressing through.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:36:08] The Lord is reminding us that we are
[1:36:12] sometimes going to get discouraged,
[1:36:15] but we're never to give up.
[1:36:18] We are sons and daughters of the King.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We are going to
[1:36:24] display the word in this hour that will
[1:36:27] overcome everything that the enemy is
[1:36:30] trying to throw.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's go to the to the
[1:36:36] next slide here.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; In John chapter 15,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I want to remind us now. We're going to
[1:36:47] wind this down. Amen.
[1:36:51] God
[1:36:53] He says here, "Ye have not chosen me."
[1:36:58] So don't put this on, oh I decided to
[1:37:02] give my heart to Jesus.
[1:37:04] You need to understand here because you
[1:37:06] have not chosen me.
[1:37:09] I have chosen you.
[1:37:12] You were in my mind before the
[1:37:14] foundations of the world.
[1:37:16] He says, he says, "And ordained you that
[1:37:20] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[1:37:23] that your fruit should remain that
[1:37:25] whatsoever you shall ask of the Father
[1:37:28] in my name, you may give
[1:37:33] it he he may give it to you."
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Man doesn't search for God.
[1:37:41] this adoption that we're talking about
[1:37:44] that you're predestinated unto predestin
[1:37:47] I'm I'm not here to tell you oh hey you
[1:37:50] can become an adopted son
[1:37:54] that's not what I've been speaking here
[1:37:55] tonight no sir if your name's in that
[1:37:59] book of inheritance
[1:38:01] you're hearing something here
[1:38:04] you're you're hearing something totally
[1:38:05] you're when you read this scripture now
[1:38:09] you understand that you didn't choose
[1:38:12] you. Oh, I had to
[1:38:15] I had to give up all these things.
[1:38:17] I chose God. I I decided to go to the
[1:38:20] altar. No, no. That's why you go to camp
[1:38:22] meetings year after year. You go to the
[1:38:24] altar and then for the rest of the year,
[1:38:26] you're back in the world.
[1:38:29] is because you haven't recognized that
[1:38:32] you've got a father that has your name
[1:38:35] written in his book of inheritance and
[1:38:39] that he chose you before you came into
[1:38:42] this. This is weak. This is going to
[1:38:45] fight you when you leave here tonight.
[1:38:49] You're going to have to overcome this
[1:38:50] thing next week when you go to school or
[1:38:53] when you when you go to work or whatever
[1:38:55] you're going to deal with. But you need
[1:38:56] this revelation of understanding.
[1:38:59] You did not choose. You chose
[1:39:05] Lord.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; He goes on here. Now read the let's go
[1:39:07] to the next quote here in adoption
[1:39:09] chapter 4. He says it. Now this may just
[1:39:12] choke you.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; But did you know that men that are sons
[1:39:18] of God are amateur gods?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't just listen. He chose you to
[1:39:28] be a manifested sonif.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; But did you know that men that are sons
[1:39:33] of God are amateur gods? How many ever
[1:39:36] know that? How many knows that Jesus
[1:39:38] said so? That the Bible Jesus said, "Do
[1:39:41] not your law say itself that ye are
[1:39:44] gods."
[1:39:46] And if you call them gods, which
[1:39:51] they were
[1:39:53] because they were, they had full do
[1:39:56] domain over the dominion of the world.
[1:39:59] Talking about Adam here.
[1:40:02] Amen. Talking about the first Adam here.
[1:40:06] Give him dominion over all things. He
[1:40:08] lost his godship.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That book of inheritance was lost
[1:40:17] right at the very beginning.
[1:40:22] That's why this book of inheritance is
[1:40:24] only going to be revealed
[1:40:26] when the sons of God are manifested
[1:40:31] because they carry the names.
[1:40:33] Hallelujah. Listen. He says and he lost
[1:40:35] his godship. He lost his sunship. He
[1:40:38] lost his domain.
[1:40:42] brother waiting for the manifestation
[1:40:46] of God to come back to it.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Did you Did you hear what he
[1:40:55] said there? We're waiting for the
[1:40:59] take over
[1:41:01] for the fullness of time. Remember
[1:41:05] scripture in Ephesians chapter 1. In the
[1:41:07] fullness of time, he's going to take
[1:41:09] everything that's in heaven. all those
[1:41:11] sons and daughters of God, the Old
[1:41:13] Testament, all the way through
[1:41:17] the end of that seventh church age. And
[1:41:19] any saint of God that dies now goes
[1:41:23] right directly to the sixth dimension.
[1:41:29] They're waiting and groaning for the
[1:41:31] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:41:34] to carry the mystery.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You mean you mean we've
[1:41:40] got a big part to do with all this? Oh
[1:41:44] yes, sir.
[1:41:45] You might think you're just 18 years
[1:41:47] old, but if you're hearing what I'm
[1:41:49] saying and there's something inside of
[1:41:51] you,
[1:41:53] let our heart burn within us
[1:41:56] along the way because there's
[1:41:58] representation
[1:42:03] of God. He says here, "But brother, we
[1:42:05] are waiting
[1:42:07] for the son of God.
[1:42:09] come back and take it over again waiting
[1:42:12] for the fullness of time
[1:42:20] but this is not the age of the love
[1:42:25] that's why don't be and you know listen
[1:42:28] we know what we believe
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; we just preach the word that the that
[1:42:33] the anointing of the Holy Ghost gives us
[1:42:36] if there's somebody that's out there.
[1:42:38] See, he's trying to convince you to
[1:42:40] listen to the tapes.
[1:42:42] Prophet, you need to come to one of my
[1:42:44] services.
[1:42:47] I quote the prophet. I listen to the
[1:42:50] tapes every single day. I've got an
[1:42:52] understanding
[1:42:55] has manifested sons
[1:42:58] in the last days that have a portion
[1:43:03] that they got to fulfill.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham fulfilled
[1:43:09] Moses is dead.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's a Joshua
[1:43:13] commission.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; There's a Revelations 108 commission
[1:43:19] this week.
[1:43:22] Amen.
[1:43:24] The pyramid gets
[1:43:27] full sons of God.
[1:43:33] Hallelujah.
[1:43:35] Take every
[1:43:37] Satan's God.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; It belongs to him.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to take every power that
[1:43:49] Satan
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; is trying to Listen, if Satan's trying
[1:43:53] to stop one of your brothers and
[1:43:54] sisters,
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; I want you to know tonight. You're a
[1:43:58] manifested son of God. If you come into
[1:44:00] this understanding,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; you can you can go after your brothers
[1:44:05] and sisters.
[1:44:08] You can be just like David and you can
[1:44:09] be the head of the enemy
[1:44:13] because you've been given a word in
[1:44:14] this.
[1:44:16] Every son and daughter written in the
[1:44:19] lamb's book of life
[1:44:21] must come.
[1:44:23] Every single one of them. You can't stop
[1:44:26] it. I can't stop.
[1:44:28] He is going to call them.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. It belongs to
[1:44:33] him.
[1:44:34] We're winding down here. Give me a few
[1:44:36] more minutes. Okay.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Let's read our next scripture.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; You might think, if the whole body were
[1:44:42] an eye, where were the hearing? If the
[1:44:45] whole were hearing, where were the
[1:44:47] spirit? But now have God set the
[1:44:51] members, every one of them in the body
[1:44:54] as it hath pleased him.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose.
[1:45:01] You're in this church here in in De Mo
[1:45:03] for a purpose.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; God put you here. You might have been
[1:45:07] going here. You might have been going
[1:45:09] there. You might have been in this in
[1:45:11] this state and in that state, but then
[1:45:13] all of a sudden you come under the
[1:45:16] anointed word under the pastor that God
[1:45:18] has ordained.
[1:45:21] He's a he's a he's an attribute of a
[1:45:24] cluster of attributes that went out from
[1:45:26] God.
[1:45:28] You were part of that cluster.
[1:45:32] You got to be under him.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; You'll only get fed under him. I come to
[1:45:35] realize that years ago when I come under
[1:45:37] John Simon.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; All I could hear when he was preaching
[1:45:41] the word was that you're a son.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; You're an adopted son.
[1:45:46] You've got you've got a position in.
[1:45:50] You're called for a purpose. Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] You're called to that eternal purpose.
[1:45:55] And all you could do was say, "Amen."
[1:45:57] And just keep going forward. I got a
[1:45:59] revelation on tithing.
[1:46:02] I was tithing for because when I caught
[1:46:04] that revelation on tithing,
[1:46:08] it kicked poverty out of my life.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Cuz I came to realize that
[1:46:14] Jehovah Gyra is my provider
[1:46:18] because because I'm a son of God. I I I
[1:46:22] take it serious.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; You either believe God or you don't.
[1:46:27] You want to believe God or you don't.
[1:46:30] God is Jehovah.
[1:46:31] You can't wait to pay your tithe. You
[1:46:34] need to make an offering.
[1:46:38] But the prophet
[1:46:40] listen God said in Malachi
[1:46:43] me. He didn't say try your pastor. He
[1:46:47] didn't say try the deacons. He said try
[1:46:50] me and see if I don't open the windows
[1:46:53] of heaven on you, the promises of God.
[1:46:56] that comes with being a son of God.
[1:46:59] Have you authority in your life?
[1:47:02] Poverty has no room in my life because
[1:47:06] Jehovah Gyra is my provider.
[1:47:09] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. He says
[1:47:12] here in adoption one, he says, "Now, who
[1:47:15] could doubt that?"
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul said. That's scripture.
[1:47:20] That's Paul's writing. That's what he
[1:47:22] taught his church,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; the church positionally before the
[1:47:26] foundations of the world. When God in
[1:47:28] his labor pain was bringing forth you,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; knowing what you would do, he
[1:47:35] positionally placed you into his own
[1:47:38] body. Now listen here to be a housewife.
[1:47:43] Oh my. You mean you can be a housewife
[1:47:46] positionally placed by God with the
[1:47:50] authority of
[1:47:52] the authority to kick this devil out of
[1:47:53] your children's life. Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] Glory to God. To be a farmer,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; to be a preacher,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; to be a prophet, to be
[1:48:06] placed you perceptionally.
[1:48:09] He knew what you were going to do. He
[1:48:12] knew that you would accept this message.
[1:48:16] You accept this word.
[1:48:19] Listen. He goes on. He says, "Then did
[1:48:20] you notice Moses the next one?" He says,
[1:48:23] "That great miracle performer that
[1:48:25] brought down Israel down through the
[1:48:28] land and brought them up to the promised
[1:48:30] land but did not place their inheritance
[1:48:33] to them.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't place them.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; It's not the tapes that are going to
[1:48:46] place you.
[1:48:50] It's God himself.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; It was John. Listen, he's saying it
[1:48:53] right here. He says he brought them but
[1:48:56] but he did not give them their
[1:48:58] inheritance.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; He led them up to the land but not
[1:49:02] divided.
[1:49:05] Is that right?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Christ brought the church up to the
[1:49:09] place to where their possession
[1:49:12] to them to give to them
[1:49:15] to cross. Oh, hallelujah. It's listen,
[1:49:18] you know that capstone and you know from
[1:49:20] the seven church ages there's a gap
[1:49:22] there. It's going to take the Holy Ghost
[1:49:25] to get you over that to bring you into
[1:49:28] that capstone. It's not going to be like
[1:49:33] anoint the Holy Ghost
[1:49:38] in our mortal
[1:49:40] from this dimension.
[1:49:43] Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] And Christ brought the church
[1:49:49] It was given to them.
[1:49:51] But the Holy Spirit is the one listen
[1:49:55] who sets the church in order.
[1:49:58] Joshua of today
[1:50:01] puts the church in its order
[1:50:04] giving to each one gift.
[1:50:10] And now listen. And he is the voice of
[1:50:13] God.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; He is the voice of God. Holy Ghost is
[1:50:18] the voice of God. Amen. That's that that
[1:50:21] that that's speaking to the man that
[1:50:25] Christ has saved the Holy Spirit.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Saints of God, have we
[1:50:34] come into the reality of God?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; And in closing,
[1:50:40] I want to say this.
[1:50:43] adoption too. Brother Brandon, he says,
[1:50:46] "In this promised land that we've been
[1:50:48] talking about here tonight,
[1:50:51] everything belongs to us."
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; In the promised land,
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; see it, Brother Collins. He says, "You
[1:50:58] see everything in the promised land."
[1:50:59] When Israel crossed over this Jordan
[1:51:02] into the promised land,
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; fought down everything. Now remember, in
[1:51:07] this promised land, that don't mean that
[1:51:09] you are immune from sickness.
[1:51:12] You're going to have battles. You're
[1:51:14] going to have to overcome.
[1:51:16] Let's make that clear. He says it
[1:51:19] doesn't mean that you're immune from
[1:51:23] spell.
[1:51:25] Let this sink.
[1:51:29] It's yours.
[1:51:31] Just rise up. Take it as sons of God.
[1:51:36] Amen. Come.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Rise up and take it.
[1:51:43] Believe the word of God.

[1:51:49] to our position.

[2:03:32] verbatim,
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; brother Vam, verbatim and still not even

[2:03:41] But the anointing of God
[2:03:44] is here to reveal to you
[2:03:47] what he said.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; And you know, people say, "Well, say it
[2:03:51] like he said it."
[2:03:55] And they will repeat it
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; without understanding
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; cuz this message is by revelation.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock I'll build my church and
[2:04:08] [music] the g gates of hell shall not
[2:04:10] prevail against it.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:14] And in order like he said, which was so
[2:04:16] beautifully brought through the
[2:04:18] scripture,
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Moses could not positionally place them.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; It [music] took Joshua
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much you think you
[2:04:34] know.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; It takes the Holy Ghost [singing]
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; to positionally place you.

[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; That is the divine nature of God.
[2:05:11] That's the purpose of the seal
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; to identify you.
