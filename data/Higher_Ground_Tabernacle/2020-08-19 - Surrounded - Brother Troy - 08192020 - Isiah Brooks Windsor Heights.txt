he is the same yesterday today and forever amen that he has not left himself without a witness amen to be a dry or dead religion amen it's good to be see here in the midst of the week i want to thank everybody for coming amen thank the musicians for always doing such a good job i've enjoyed the last year or so since they've been coming around this place it's definitely been a blessing to this little body amen amen so let's just get right into the word of the lord i think our brother announced the the wedding this weekend i know it'd be a blessing for those that can make it amen amen let's uh open our bibles to the book of matthew chapter 13. and uh i want to speak a message called surrounded that's matthew chapter 13. we'll start at the 24th verse and we'll go ahead and read on through this entire parable down to the 30th verse there and it says that's matthew 13 24 and another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went upon his way and but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did thou not sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares and he said unto them an enemy hath done this and the snake the servant said to them wilt thou that we should go and gather them up he said nay lest while ye gather them up the tares you root up also the wheat with them and so he says there in verse 30 let them both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say unto the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we just approach unto your your precious word this evening father with all honor and reverence lord that's due unto it lord knowing lord that we are unworthy father to even open up this book lord unworthy even to approach unto it father but lord the thou has collected us out of the people of this earth lord you have made us worthy father you've washed us in your blood father you've sanctified us lord lord you've made us clean you've put up us upon your uh your throne father and lord we couldn't have done this by ourselves lord but it's you that has chose us father it's you that has revealed yourself to us lord and we do not take that choice lightly father but lord in the midst of this choice father we we rise up say and say and recognize the choice and say lord hear am i lord send me to the nations lord hear my lord let me be that the one that you that you have chosen to glorify in this day and lord we just want to thank you for these things lord we pray that tonight lord you'd open up your word in that way that only you can do it lord like you did on the road to emmaus father there's only one person that can do it and that's the person of the lord jesus christ so we come to you lord open your word to our hearts into our eyes and our ears this morning lord as we look upon your word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated surrounded the title so i consider this i was thinking about the story about elisha when he was went over to a certain place and and woke up in the morning and and they realized that they were surrounded by the enemy the syrians and his servants said woe unto us you know there's we are surrounded we're going to perish and elisha was not moved by the report he was not afraid at the words of his servant but as he considered what the servant said and he considered what his eyes said then he looked back and considered the revelation of jehovah and considered what the revelation said and the revelation said lord there is greater as he is with us than he that is in the world amen and he said to he's just prayed a real quick prayer he said lord open up gehey's eyes show this young man that there is more that is with us than there is with the enemy and as gaheza was looking around and seeing all the syrians all of a sudden his eyesight began to change and all sudden he began to see little flickers of light over here and flickers of light over there and all of a sudden these flaming wheels and chariots begin to appear in the sky and and all of a sudden his his field of vision was completely changed and he saw a revelation his his entire mindset was changed in an instant where he saw that there was chariots of fire and horsemen of fire surrounding all around about them so at this one move by the assyrians we met by this heavenly army all fear left all wonderings all doubts amen though they were surrounded by the enemy but it was greater as is is the ones that were as greater as he that was with him greater is he that loved them amen than those that hated them and that's kind of what i want to focus on tonight is greater is he that loved us than those that hate us amen always remember that greater is he that has that has told us about his tender mercies greater is he that has revealed his loving kindness to us greater is he that said i will always be with you greater is he that says i will be with you even unto the end of the age greater is that one than the things that surround us so even like as we said there in the parable jesus even told us you will be surrounded amen as i put the good seed in the field that good seed will be surrounded by the tariffs i have seen it from far off i saw it before the foundation of the world amen and i saw the enemy come in i know that the enemy sowed his tares i know that they are there amen and i have i have declared in my wisdom that they will not be rooted up till the end amen but he says i will send the binding time amen and i'll bind the tares first amen so as we as we look upon the newspapers as we consider those that hate us amen as we consider the ones that that that would rise up against us i mean you know every every good crisis is a time for those that are in power to act out against those that they hate you know like we've heard the the the phrase never let a good crisis go uh to waste you know and and and and these crises will come like birth pains it's been prophesied beforehand there will be an ebb and a flow but each ebb gets stronger and stronger each flow gets stronger and stronger you know and we know that these times will come and we know these times will go and they know that the time will get shorter and shorter and shorter and as these things get worse and worse as they get bound up closer they will get stronger amen but greater is he that is with us than he that is in the world and even though we may seem at times to be surrounded uh you know even as the the in the parable you know the the messenger came to the to the ma the master of the field and said sir look what has happened to your field there's fruits that are not what you planted and and the householder says an enemy has done this he identified the enemy but he says i know who the enemy is and i know who my children are and let me know god knows who you are amen god can look into his field and he can identify you god can look out over the human race and he knows who you are he knows where his seed is he knows he knows remember when uh uh uh when elijah said uh i i am all alone you know i'm all alone in the land there is no one else left and jehovah answered back right away and says i have seven thousand that i have kept to myself that have not bowed their knee into baal i have seven thousand that have not worshipped baal they've not worshiped the denominations they've always had that thing in their mind where they just couldn't go there they just couldn't go to that place amen i've reserved them unto myself and god knows where those seven thousand are amen god knows with that seventh church age that comes out of laodicea amen that is set free from laodicea god knows where they are at amen an enemy has done this but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world the enemy has come with a goal in his mind amen you know god has real enemies amen they're they're not they're not just a play thing these are real enemies amen they're uh they're they're they're they're not to be just discounted you know there's real consequences to his enemies he has real powers but there is no power that is greater than our god's power amen and this enemy has a goal to exalt and to lift up his kingdom above god's kingdom to lift up his word above god's word to lift up his power of above god's power he has a to lift up his revelation above god's revelation to bring the people into a fear amen he has a goal to to completely destroy the sons and daughters of god to destroy their character to destroy their bodies through sin through sickness through death through unbelief to just completely destroy the the enemy of god or the the children of god amen as satan comes bible says as a roaring lion he's looking to whom he can devour amen he's come by your house he's walked by your door he's been rattling the doorknobs at the back at the front at the side he's lifting up on the garage door he's trying to get in he's trying all of your windows amen the enemy is here amen he is seeking whom he can devour and he's coming by your house amen but greater is he that is within us than he that is within the world we know that this times will come amen the enemy will try to come through sin through sickness through unbelief through temptation amen and we're not strangers to these things we see the temptations that come by our path we know the weaknesses that are in our own lives but greater is he that is within us than he is in the world amen amen because god knows where his seat is amen and no matter what condition they get themselves in god has a watchful eye upon them amen so if you find yourself in a place where you ought not to be if you find yourself in sickness if you find yourself falling to temptation look upon look up to the heavens stop just stop right there when you find yourself stumbling for one of satan's stumbling blocks stop right there go no further amen take that time turn around look up to the one that is here to help you amen because god knows that in this day that we would be surrounded this is not a day to be ashamed of the gospel this is not a day to be ashamed of the lord jesus christ amen he is our only source of salvation he is our only source he's our only help in a time of temptation amen this is the time that we ought to be identified with the lord jesus christ in every part of our lives amen it's not a time to be hiding that you're a christian amen it's not a time to be uh playing around amen to be fooling with this are full of that but this is a day to bind yourself more closely with the lord jesus christ amen this is not a time i want to say that again this is not a time to be ashamed of the lord jesus christ he is coming for a bride that is that is uh uh identified with him amen she has taken his name she has taken his power amen she has taken his word amen she has taken his name upon herself amen and she's gone down into the waters of baptism amen she's come up to walk a life everlasting amen newness of life amen she's not here to be playing around with the devil amen but she is here to be identified with the lord jesus christ amen because christ is coming back to for a bride that is identified and holding up the banner of the lord jesus christ amen amen so hold your fruits up high amen when jesus christ and that parable looks out at the field he considered the fruits and he knew them by their fruits but the fruit has to be held up high amen the banner has to be held up high stand up be identified so when the binding time comes that you're not bound up in sin and sickness or unbelief why because you're holding your fruits up high you're holding up to the work amen amen jesus said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation but for behold the kingdom of god is within you but satan is against that kingdom amen therefore he is coming after you amen amen he is as a roaring lion he is coming after you to shake you down amen to destroy your fruit amen we're not surprised by this amen this is not a shock to us we know that he's a roaring lion we know that there will be temptations we know that there will be stumblings we know that there will be uh satan will try to get you to disbelieve this or disbelieve this or to compromise upon this or to compromise on that we know those things amen but this is not a time amen to be falling for the snares of the enemy amen amen satan has a goal to completely destroy to ruin to bring down the kingdom of god through sin sickness and unbelief to put blemishes upon the church of the almighty god but we are here to hold up the flay of god to hold the banner of god to keep the church clean through the blood of the lamb amen but in spite of all of this god has prophesied that there will be a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish in spite of all that the enemy can do with all of his temptations all of his sin with all his sickness there is a prophecy out there that there will be a bride and despite of it all there will be a bride they'll be without spot without wrinkle and without blemish and i have come to this day to to to bring that prophecy to pass amen and so of you amen amen we ought to take that prophecy and lift it up high keep it at the forefront of our minds every day of our life i am here to waive that prophecy as a banner i am here to be the church of god the people of god the bride of christ without spot or without wrinkle holding the banner of the lord jesus christ until the very end amen amen amen to combat this uh onslaught of the enemy we have been given the blood of the lamb the power of the holy ghost amen and prayer is our tools to fight this enemy the blood of the lamb the the prayer and the power of the holy spirit has been given to the bride of the lord jesus christ to keep her clean amen do you think it will work do you think it's effective we ought to try using it more don't you think hey man we all try we all get good at using it hey man we are we all know what it's capable of we want to be able to testify we've seen it in action amen that when satan came to do this i went down into prayer amen the holy spirit came upon the seat amen and god the one that surrounded me i found out that that even though the enemy had me surrounded i found out that greater is thought there was another one there was a friend that surrounded me with a greater surrounding amen amen amen is the same yesterday today and forever i remember the story i don't i'm not going to turn to it but from the book of judges there was a time when i think it was manasseh he went up to joshua he began to complain he said joshua the inheritance that you gave me that you wrote out in your book by the inspiration of the holy ghost the the inheritance you gave me is too small i i just i'm cramped i can't live in this inheritance that you gave me and joshua kind of got a little puzzled look on his face and like let me get my book out and he opened up the book and he found out and he says well this is all the land the manassas should have he says it goes over here to this boundary and it it goes way over here to here and way up here to here and it goes all the way over to here have you have you taken over the land well yeah yeah well yeah i i well i've taken over the the the mountaintops i couldn't well i couldn't take over the valleys and and and then over here it's it's it's full of trees and we can't live there and so all i really have is just these little tiny mountain tops to live on and i can't live anywhere else and joshua says this is why i wrote the book amen this is why the promise has been written down go out there and conquer the enemy go out there and get your saws out cut down these trees and you'll have more than enough room in your inheritance amen so many times we live so far underneath our we go out to the holy spirit lord you get this is just such a hard life you know and we're we're we're being disobedient to the word over here and we're and we're the word says to do this and yet we do this and and as soon as as soon as a pastor preaches a sermon called obedience all of a sudden your mind starts thinking about all the little areas that you're being disobedient and disobedience over here you're not complying with the word over here and and if a certain pastor is the gap behind the pulpit says today we're going to preach on obedience to the word of god and all of a sudden your mind just starts to think oh lord i've been doing this i know lord i've your word says to do this but i've been doing this over here and i know i shouldn't do this but i've been doing this over here anyway and you wonder why am i not living in overcoming life when the whole bible said that the bride of christ will be without spot without wrinkle that she in the last days that she would be an overcomer that she would overcome the enemy in all things and you can go and complain lord why is my life so hard lord why do i have all this why do i have all this because you're not fighting the enemy that you are surrounded by you're surrounded by the enemy god knew you would be surrounded by the enemy but greater is he that is surrounding you with his loving kindness greater is he that is surrounding you with the power of prayer greater is he that is surrounding you with the power of the holy ghost amen amen he has surrounded you with a greater power than an enemy's power amen satan goes like a roaring lion but in spite of all this god has prophesied that we've been given the blood of the lamb the holy spirit and prayer to overcome the enemy amen you remember the story of the parable of the mustard seed jesus said the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed when it is sown into the earth is smaller than all the seeds of the field but when it is grown it becomes greater than everything and so is it to be in you the kingdom of heaven has been sown in your life by the preaching of the gospel by the preaching of this word the faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god and the kingdom of god is being preached to you you know the john the baptist came preaching the kingdom jesus christ came preaching the kingdom the kingdom of heaven is coming the kingdom of heaven is coming the kingdom of heaven is here amen and we're preaching this holy ghost gospel to you and it's coming like a little mustard seed it's so so simple it's also is is it's just as simple as that brother it's just as simple as that amen when it's sown it seems so small but let me tell you you just let that get to working in your life amen it'll become greater and greater and greater and all men will look upon that planting later on down in life and where did that man get to where he's at where did that you know when people they they put people uh christians up on pedestals you know that live and overcoming life oh i wish i could be like brother so-and-so oh i wish i could be like sister so-and-so is always praying always seems to have an answer to prayer and all these things well you don't know what she's done in secret in her closet amen for she who prays in secret he who prays in secret in their closet jesus said those that pray to me in secret in their closet i will reward them openly amen amen well that's the power that god has given you over the enemy is your prayer life amen so when satan comes like a roaring lion and surrounds you you have an overcoming power amen they will answer for your behalf surrounded what are you surrounded by amen when you when you look around when you consider your life when you look at the circumstances in your life when you look at the the powers that surround you what do you see first you see the enemy let me tell you the syrian army was a small thing to elijah but it was a great thing to haze it amen it was a small thing but now the chariots of fire were not even visible to geheza but they are powerful to elijah amen so what are you surrounded by what do you see in your life when satan the roaring lion comes and you do you say oh here i go i'm going to fall again i'm gonna stumble into sin again the temptation's coming i'm gonna oh i'm just gonna lay down and give up right here amen or do you get out your sword and say satan do you dare come by the house of the son of god amen with this temptation once again for when jesus was tempted he got out the word of god he says but the word said but the word said but the word said amen get your sword out saints amen greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world the united states has embassies all over the world in many nations amen and we are jealous over those embassies we're not to give those embassies up lightly amen and and we protect them and so is so if the ambassador comes to that if the united states ambassador comes the nation he goes to the embassy first you know and he and he uh that's our place there and if there's uh one of our one of our countrymen is in trouble in that country they can go to the embassy for help well we are the embassy of the lord jesus christ we are the place where jesus said uh the foxes have dents the the birds of the air have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head well that has changed amen that has changed because the capstone is coming down amen and he has a place to lay his head amen the place is the pyramid that is being built up amen it's the bride of christ and the capstone is coming to us he has a place now to place his head amen we are the embassy we are the ambassadors of christ when christ comes where is he coming for he's coming for you and me and when christ comes he's coming right here amen right here to the bride of the lord jesus christ amen those embassies are protected amen because they're surrounded they may look like they're surrounded by the country that they're in but they're surrounded by the protection of the united states amen and so are we we're we are surrounded by the protection of the word of god amen it is our protection amen if you could give advice to that tribe of manasseh what would you say to them you know when they said our our inheritance is too small we we just can't make this work we we we've tried and we just there's just not enough room for us and they went and they looked up in the book he says well you haven't even overcome yet what kind of advice would you give to that tribe amen take that same advice amen and give it to yourself amen amen amen let's turn over to uh psalms chapter 17. peter said think it not strange when feary temptations surround you when trials try to take you over psalms chapter 17 the sixth verse here is david i can just you know david is a man that he knew who his god was he had had so many experiences with jehovah that he knew what jehovah was capable of he knew that where his prayers went when he prayed amen david knew that when he prayed he knew exactly where his prayer would go and he knew what god was going to do with his prayer amen amen and so when you get down to the psalm 17 verse 6 he says david is praying there he says i have called upon thee for thou will hear o god i like that amen he knew that god would hear him amen incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech show thy marvelous lovingkindness oh thou that save us by thy right hand them that would puts thy trust in thee from those that rise up against them keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings uh he he knew who his god was he knew what his god was capable of and he was going to take what his god was capable of and assign that to himself and say this is mine my god is capable of healing therefore i have healing my god is capable of deliverance therefore i have deliverance my god is capable of loving me therefore i have his love i go my god is capable of tender mercies therefore i have his tender mercies i i claim them i own them they are mine and greater are those things that surround me than the enemy that has surrounded me verse 8 keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppressed me from my deadly enemies who compass me about amen he david was surrounded he knew he was surrounded by his enemy but he knew that greater was he the the greater one he might not be able to see him with his eyes he might not have hurt him with his ears but his faith said so his faith was able to reach out his faith reached out and grabbed a hold of the things of god and brought them into his place of his life he says i call unto you o god because i know you will hear me you are the god that hears my prayers therefore i've called you unto me i'm ready to call out the resources of heaven into my life amen i hope you have the same testimony his deadly enemy oppressed him had him surrounded verse 12 he begins to describe the enemy he says verse 11 i mean he says they have now compassed us surrounded us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth like a lion that is greedy of his prey you've never seen a lion that's stalking us pray that lion has a thing in his mind that he's getting ready to do he's getting ready to pounce he knows that he's getting ready to take over his prey getting ready to take the the the helpless animal out of the field the and he and he's pouncing he's crouching he's crouching he's getting ready and david saw that the enemy was getting ready to pounce enemy was getting ready to leap at him the enemy had his claws out he was out for blood amen and david saw this but he knew that greater was the god's surrounding enemy that surrounded him amen like as an enemy that is like as a lion as greedy of as prey and as it were a young lion lurking in the secret places i love verse 13 here arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked amen disappoint him lord the enemy is getting ready to cr getting ready to pounce something lord the enemy is getting ready to leap into my life the enemy is getting ready to do this lord rise up lord come down from heaven come upon the scene disappoint the enemy in my life disappoint the the enemy has a plan for my life lord disappoint him cast him down lord amen do you think god heard david's prayer amen do you think god will hear your prayer in the same situation amen your faith ought to rise up and say this is my i am claiming my life for the gospel sake i am claiming this life as the bride of jesus christ i am claiming my life as the embassy of the most high god i am claiming my life as a as the pyramid where the capstone was coming down to amen i am claiming myself as the one that is holding the banner in the last days that when jesus christ descends out of the heavens i will be here amen holding waving the banner up high amen amen disappoint the enemy the one that has surrounded me the one who has a plan to destroy my life lord disappoint him amen bring the word back to pass in my life amen remember brother branham said that that the the revelation of jesus christ had a threefold purpose to it he said the threefold mystery of christ was to reveal forgot for god jehovah to reveal himself in christ to have the preeminence in the bride amen and to restore eden back upon the earth again that was the threefold mystery amen of the revelation of the lord jesus christ amen and that and that that that revelation is playing out in the bride of christ right now amen brother branham said that the uh the bride of christ was being restored back to eden like the fall had the tighter the binding the more we stand alone amen then what will happen next remember i will send the angels i will send the angels and there will be a harvest and a reaping and i'll take them up into glory amen the angels are coming after you amen one of these days in a moment and twinkling of an eye amen the holy spirit will leave the earth and all those that are filled with the holy ghost are going with him amen we call it the rapture amen the he when he who lets is taken out of the way the holy spirit will leave the earth amen the earth will descend into a dark chaos that has never been seen amen but those that are filled with the holy ghost when the holy ghost leaves we have to go with him amen we just we're not staying behind amen we're sealed together we're married together amen we've been joined to the holy ghost flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen we can't be left without him so in the holy spirit when he who lets us take it out of the way the bride of christ will go up in the rapture amen amen amen the kingdom of heaven is available unto us all the resources of heaven is behind the bride getting in position amen when the kingdom of heaven was sown into the earth it was sown as a mustard seed amen but as it is growing amen it begins to bring for its fruit and due season amen amen and it'll be greater than all the herbs of the field when his sown is small but it becomes greater amen amen peter said peter said beloved think it not strange concerning the fury trials which are to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of christ's suffering so peter is saying here that the fury trials that you are going through are linked with the suffering of the lord jesus christ think about that when the enemy surrounds you and brings his temptations to you peter is linking that suffering with the suffering that the lord jesus christ suffered amen remember where did sin come from in the first place it came from the devil amen who who's if you are to take the abstract the title deed of of sin and to research it back who does it really belong to it belongs to satan who brought the sin in the beginning satan did so in the well where were you in the beginning where were you and the

by the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blemish amen that's the church that christ is coming back for and it won't be long he's coming soon saints amen the prophecy the brother brahms prophecies have gone out amen that he got to receive from the lord jesus christ

us amen we are here to be like elijah that when we saw the syrian army we did not consider us surrounded by that army any more than when i go on a picnic i consider myself surrounded by ants amen amen

that is in the world amen he said i will god will give me a set me a table in the presence of my enemies amen when the enemies surround me about god will lay out the tablecloth on the table they'll set up the plates just set out service for two you and him communing together in the presence of your enemies that when your enemies come to to gnash at you with their teeth when enemies come to to to

out amen and he comes down to earth and he is knows his time is short and he goes raging in a tribulation period while we have a honeymoon all of our sins washed away amen and is this the man is this the man as isaiah said amen let's just stand an enemy has done this and the parable has said an enemy has done this but jesus christ knew that greater was his plan than all the plans of the enemy greater was the plan of the lord jesus christ in the plans of the enemy as even though an enemy has done this that's okay i knew it was all happening before it will not hinder my purpose my fruit will remain he looked out over the field and he and he saw that all the seeds that he planted surrounded by their enemy but he wasn't worried he says that's okay i'll send out my angels we'll bind those terrorists together we'll bind them together and as they are bound the bride of christ will stand alone she'll stand alone amen i have seven thousand that have not bowed their knee to baal i have seven thousand that are trusting in me and me alone i have seven thousand to have lifted up the banner of the lord jesus christ and though satan the enemy comes and he says this he does this yet there they stand even as i bind the enemy tighter and tighter as i bind the tears tighter and tighter there stands the bride of the lord jesus christ she may sometimes thinks that she's alone but yet there she stands she's just standing there she's standing there why because the word said she would stand there amen amen and that and that and that fruit is surrounded not necessarily by the enemy not by the enemy power flows are just little things she is surrounded surrounded by the tender mercies of the lord jesus christ she is surrounded by his loving kindness by his tender hand of mercy amen
