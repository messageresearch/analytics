Oh Jesus, today is mine. Amen. God bless you. I was going to sing a song, but we'll just get straight into the word. And I appreciate the song service. And how's everybody doing this evening? Amen. I've preached maybe like six, seven times, but every time I get up there, it always feels like it's my first time. &gt;&gt; Always gets very nervous in the beginning. &gt;&gt; But you just pray for me. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we come before you as humbly as we know how. &gt;&gt; In your precious name, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, your word says, "Whatsoever you do in deeds or in words, do it all in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we sing in the name of Jesus Christ. We prayed in the name of Jesus Christ. We live in the name of Jesus Christ. And now, Father Lord, we want to preach in the name of Jesus. Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray that you help me to put myself out of the way, that you may use my leaves to speak to your people, Lord Jesus, that you may use their hearts to receive your word. Lord, you know what they came for? They came to hear from you and And I pray that you grant their desires, Lord Jesus. And I bind every spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus. And may the word of God have its way. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We may turn to First Timothy chapter 4. and verse 6 verse 6. The Bible says, "If thou put the brethren in in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine where unto thou has attained by refuse profane and old wives fables. and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. &gt;&gt; You know, I repeat that again. Exercise thyself rather unto godliness. &gt;&gt; For bodily bodily exercise profit little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of my title for tonight is going to be feats for the task that's a that is at hand. So feeds for the task at hand. And I got inspired by uh this quote of the prophet just once more Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "And I have hoped that I haven't failed anywhere to try to do everything that I know how to do. for us to be in a better spiritual condition and physical condition tonight &gt;&gt; than we were when we come in here about four or five nights ago. And if I fail, God forgive me and you forgive me. [Music] So the thing that caught my attention here is that the prophet had to he says he had to do everything that he knew how to to get the people in a better spiritual and then he says the purpose is to in a better spiritual condition than you were four or five nights ago. So in other word, every time we come up here to preach, the purpose should be to get you to be in a better spiritual condition than you were yesterday. And that also means that you as Christians when you come to the church of God, the goal is to make sure that you get in a better spiritual condition than you were last Sunday. Because the Christian walk is not a walk where you just stand still wherever you are. You got to keep moving forward. Even Paul said, "Let us run this race. When you when you run a race, you don't stop. You keep going." But you notice that scripture also says to run that race with patience. because this race get gets lengthy sometimes and you can get tired. &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you that if each one of us here they told us that run one mile and your reward is each one gets $5 million. No matter how tired you get, you will keep running. So the reason why many people stopping their walk with God is because they don't understand the reward that's ahead. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul says to keep your eyes on that prize. Keep your eyes on that reward knowing that the reward that we'll get is eyes and ears have not heard what God has has reserved for us. So going back to first Timothy chapter 4 again my my topic is feet for the task at hand. God has a task for each each and every one of us. Each and every one of us we have a duty. God did not just come here didn't just send you here to sit on these on these chairs. God didn't just give give you the green card so you can just come fill this this seat. God didn't just give you the gift of playing the instrument so you can just come and play that. On my way to church, I was reading a quote or listening to a message. The prophet says that if you if you have failed if if you're not a son of God, you have failed to accomplish the purpose of God has sent each and every one of us to be sons and daughters of God. But but there's a process. You got to make sure you stay fit because Paul knew about fitness apparently [Applause] that he spoke to Timothy on fitness. He says that um he says in verse in verse seven, "But refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. So apparently we know that god godliness won't just come like that to you. You got to exercise yourself unto god. That's why you got to that's why the bible says whatsoever is good as virtue you know whatsoever is good think on those things. &gt;&gt; That's why David had said that I've always kept you before my face. because he had to pract practice godliness. Uh let's keep reading that verse. For bodily exercise profitth little in this journey on earth some of us we have to get we have to to to practice physically to stay fit. Paul that only profitth you little. That means he has good. He has something good but he's just little. &gt;&gt; So like I I remember one time I know this one person he he wouldn't come to church on a Wednesday I think or Friday because he was going to the gym. That's what Paul is talking about. It profitth you little but this godliness when you exercise it is profitable unto all things. So when you practice godliness not only profitth your physical but also profitth your spirit. The Bible says, "Having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come." Because the Bible says that without godliness, no man shall see God. If you want to have a life after, you got to see God. But you have to be holy. You have to be holy. And and so let let me read that again. &gt;&gt; Having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. Why is he saying this exercise profitth in this earth and also the next let me give an example for some people that go to the gym for instance before going to the gym you have in your mind a certain image that you want to be like you have a certain goal that you're trying to achieve some want to just stay stay skinny knew someone I got muscles and all but you have a certain and when Paul this this this is the this is the mind of God what's written in this book. &gt;&gt; So when God is telling you to also work out spiritually he has a certain image that he wants you to become like and and again let's get back to it. It says this life and the life after. Brother says that there's only one thing that you take out of this world to go with it to the other world. He says it's character. Your character is the only thing that's going to leave this earth, this world, and go to the other to heaven. By your character, you can already know if you are going to go to heaven or not. Because if you commit fornication, if you're an adulterer, the Bible says there will be any there won't be any adulterers in heaven. [Applause] You know, if your that's why your prophet preached the message, is your life worthy of the gospel. Those whose life is worthy of the gospel will make it. And then the mistake that many people do, you look at your I'm sure a lot I used to have a problem with is your that message is your life worthy of the gospel problem because I felt like I was just guilty from the beginning to the end. I felt like I would never be worthy. That's true. you will not be worthy because there's only one person that is worthy. He's the only person that matters. So when you look through Christ then you say your life is worthy of God. Why? Because you are dead in Christ and only his life matters. But only when you die in Christ some of us are still living. You can't make it there if you're still living in the old flesh. This character won't make you there. You got to be a godly character. The prophet and Peter said that you need to build all these virtues so that you may inherit of the godly nature. Why? Because only godly nature is there in heaven. The entire family of heaven is named after Christ. nature won't make you there. &gt;&gt; My nature got to die. &gt;&gt; You know, only godly nature will make you there. &gt;&gt; So God is like, I have an image of my bride. I have this image that she needs to be just like me. &gt;&gt; But I need to give her a blueprint. &gt;&gt; I need to give her instructions. workout, exercise, but not just physical exercise, but exercise godliness. Why? Because I want her to be like me. I am holy and thou got to be holy like me. The prophet preached, he says that it was not the mountain that was holy, but it was the holy God on the mountain. So your life becomes worthy of the gospel when the holy God lives inside of you &gt;&gt; and he's willing to actually come and live inside of you because it would be so unfair to God to ask you to do something that he knows you you already cannot do willing to help because he knows that you cannot do anything on your own. Didn't he say the battle is not yours but it's of the Lord? The problem is that we want to keep fighting our own battles ourselves. But we need to remember that we have a God who promised us that he will never leave us. He will never forsake us. No matter comes our way, he's still going to be with us. It's a song that my brother wrote. It doesn't matter what you do. The love of God will not change for you before the foundation of the world. Before even your mother conceived you in her womb, God loved you. Why? Because you are himself. You are part of him. It will be very insane to not love yourself. The world when the Bible says God so loved the world The prophet says that truly God didn't die for the entire world. He only died for his only people. He only died for his chosen people. Because you got the the the Bible is full of types. The Bible tells us that when Eve fell, she was deceived. But Adam was not deceived. &gt;&gt; So Adam will Adam willfully gave his gave his life for his for he sinned against God so he could save his wife. So that's the same thing. God Jesus when he died on on the cross willingfully choice. He could have backed out of it. He wanted his wife to get some point on if it be pleasing to you, let this cup go away from you. &gt;&gt; But then he looked at and why did Adam do this? Because Adam gave his life for Eve. The revelation behind it is because Adam knew that Eve was Adam. was Adam. The Bible says that in the beginning God was calling both of them Adam. So he couldn't sit sit still and see uh if that why was that that was the Christ nature in nature Jesus Christ saw a part of himself that was himself that they were dying on earth to intervene &gt;&gt; and he he didn't have a choice but he gave his life Why? Because you couldn't go to hell. So why were you going to go? Because the Bible says hell was created for Satan. You honor Satan. You honor his angel. So God had to provide a way for you to what belongs to you. Heaven belongs to you. Blessings belong to you. Everything that God says is everything that belongs to God belongs to you. That's why you got to start looking yourself through the mirror of the word because you got to look at yourself to be like Christ. Peter says build you up into the godly nature. &gt;&gt; And God is a perfectionist. perfectionist. &gt;&gt; God doesn't start something that he cannot fix. You can start from faith to patience. If you stop there, the bride got to be just like God. The full uh the fullness of God dwell in Jesus. And now all that was in Jesus has been poured into Christ. Nothing was left out. Everything has been poured into the bride. That is a perfectionist perfectionist. &gt;&gt; You go all the way to patience &gt;&gt; and you decide to stop. I'm encouraging you to keep going forward. You got to keep running the race because you got to have the nature of God in order to be there. of says that only perfect love will make you there. Perfect love at the top. &gt;&gt; When you have perfect love, then you have the full Yeah. You have the perfect nature of God. The bride doesn't settle for a something that's just halfway done. That's why they got they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But the Bible says we go from from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; So you got to keep walking forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God has a purpose for each and every one of us. I told myself that I really I didn't want to leave anything out from my notes, but we'll see how God lead and it's just beautiful the way God gave me this message without even trying hard. He just kept putting everything together. While I was studying, I was I was looking for this one uh and I was I was so busy with with like studying other stuff that I didn't I didn't want to spend my time on that &gt;&gt; and on my way to church listening to this message and I find that same quote. So whatever God has for us tonight, that's so we are in a battlefield. You know, we we are in this battle &gt;&gt; and you cannot go to the battle out of shape because the devil is not something to be messing around with. If he was, then the Bible would have said, "Put on the partial armor of God. But the Bible did not say put on the partial armor of God. Put on halfway through your per the statue of a perfect man. Put on the whole armor of God. You may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. Paul is telling to the Ephesian church, &gt;&gt; it's not just enough to have a partial armor. You got to go all the way. No, &gt;&gt; God is building you into the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; That's why he's asking you to exercise exercise spiritually. You know &gt;&gt; while we are on this journey on earth, we got to because we are in in a journey. &gt;&gt; We are just passing through. We have a mission. Every one of us has a mission. If your mission is done, then you go back to heaven. Go back to heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; in this journey, we see that there's there's going to be afflictions that's going to come along the way. &gt;&gt; There's going to be things that come on the way at us. &gt;&gt; But we have to be ready. We have to be fit for the journey. You cannot go to a journey of uh 500 mile and you only bring one bottle of water in the desert. It doesn't make sense. You will die of thirst. &gt;&gt; And then I love the prophet tells us that God doesn't God doesn't do things partially or do you really believe that God will send you on this journey without giving you the proper equipment? The prophet says that God never takes a fully equipped man. But he takes that person that doesn't have nothing and he fully equips that person. The problem is we got to whatever we have, we got to lay it aside. I don't want my equipment, but I want your equipment. No, I don't want my will, but I want your will. David on the battlefield, Saul wanted to give him his equipment. &gt;&gt; But God had given David a special equipment that represented Jus, the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God told David, if you take the name of Jesus Christ with you, The Bible says he represents the name of Jesus Christ. Nothing will stand against you. Saul wanted to give him a man-made system. [Applause] That's the reason why there are still Goliath challenging you in your life. God has given you a weapon. God has given you his name. So why is your Goliath Goliath still there? Is Goliath still there? Goliath was still there until David showed up. &gt;&gt; Goliath started scaring the army of God. But when David who had an experience with God came [Applause] that challenges the army of God. That's what you need to tell the devil. &gt;&gt; Who are you to challenge the army of God? &gt;&gt; I don't know about others. I know that I am in the army of God. God will never take you into his army without giving you his weapon. his word says the word of God will defeat Satan anytime circumstances still there's your own fault it's your own fault open your eyes you that's why God told Moses what is in your hand what is in your This word, this has power. &gt;&gt; If you take this into your heart, you take the faith of God and you believe it and you just leave it there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a double-edged sword. &gt;&gt; And there's not enough chains that can stand against this. enemy challenging you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take the word of God with you. Take the word of God and cut his head off, cut his feet off. Doesn't the Bible says if heaven causes you to if your right hand causes you to offend God, cut it off. But who causes you to who offends you? It's only the devil. So why are you allow him to keep talking to your mind? God is reminding you that you have a weapon in just come to lay in a in a written book. I did not just come to lay on shelves at home in the morning and say, "Lord, bless me. I'm I'm about to have a word to cut off the enemy. This word is a weapon to you. &gt;&gt; You got to use it. &gt;&gt; There's power in the word of God. There's power in the word of God. Put the word of God upon your lips. Nothing shall stand against you. Maybe the thing you need to ask God is, "Lord, teach me how to use your way. like because sometimes you can go to war and you've never used an a chemical weapon for instance. &gt;&gt; So if you use it the wrong way, you might blow yourself. So you need to ask God how come other people how come other people are able to take this same word and this become into a reality. Every uh uh scripture in the book is yours. It's yours. It's not just given to your brother or your sister. It's yours. Lord, why does he keep on having victories but I cannot? He's using the same word that that you read and sometimes the same word that you don't even read a few months ago. I remember and he says that there's a lot of people in this church who go even weeks without even ever reading the Bible. go an entire week without even opening your Bible. &gt;&gt; And we wonder why we have defeat. &gt;&gt; We wonder why we have problems. The solution to the problem lays in the word of God. But it's not too late. Amen. Thank you, Lord. that that Goliath needs to be cut off, that Goliath needs to die. We just read a quote where the prophet said he want the people to be in a better spiritual condition than they were five years ago. You came in You came in with a Goliath challenging you. Get you out of this with a Goliath out of your life. If you want to do it for you, you got to take things into your own. I believe confessing the word of God. God [Applause] cannot do this on your own. You cannot do this on your own. and you need him. He knows you need him. That's why he said come. He who are labor weary I don't know how to use this weapon. Lord I'm falling every day. I'm so tired weary. Come to me. I will give you rest. What is the rest is the Holy Ghost. Who is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost when it comes into you with you. The prophet says that everything you need in this journey, you have it when you receive the Holy Ghost. So let the Holy Ghost fall on you. Say, "Lord, I receive you. Come into my heart. My goodness. I keep I cannot even get down. Oh, I'm still on the first page." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet talks about &gt;&gt; how when he went to Africa &gt;&gt; and he noticed how they have a lot of mosquitoes, &gt;&gt; you know, and I can witness to that. We have a lot of mosquitoes back in the Congo. Sometimes when you you you travel to those places, they ask you to take a vaccine to build your immunity against it. &gt;&gt; But the prophet says that he had noticed that those natives from Africa. They had a lot of mosquitoes all around their legs with no vaccines at all and it was doing nothing to them. The prophet says that's what the mother that's what that's what in the message communion paragraph 105 preached in 1962 &gt;&gt; he says that's what's the matter today with the people that's what the matter with the church &gt;&gt; we got so many baby shots and man-made theology we are prayed over theology What we need is God's inoculation by the word of the Lord God. Men shall live daily by that kind of food. Now he's telling you this is how you exercise. This is how you start building muscles. This is how you cannot just exercise wanting to build muscles without eating. You know, you can't you have to eat &gt;&gt; and and then he's saying that we need men shall live daily by thy kind of food build his soul into inoculation from spiritual diseases jumping around the country. You know each you know each country specific they have their own demons. &gt;&gt; You know in the Bible sometimes you see he'll says the prince of the this the prince of this place even when Daniel was praying. You know the angel came and says that the one of the princes stopped me from from getting certain demons that function well in Africa. There are certain demons that function well in the US. And one thing I've noticed a lot about the US that I've I I've never really paid that attention in coms that's very common in the US. &gt;&gt; Why? That's why the prophet even preached on a message uh uh pressure the let us &gt;&gt; letting off the pressure &gt;&gt; letting off the pressure on on um letting off &gt;&gt; because he noticed people have too much pressure a lot of things in your mind people rushing just to go pills and all those things &gt;&gt; and it's leading you into depression. Because it says the from spiritual disease jumping around the country. This is spiritual disease around specific countries. comes to bite us. They usually get us and we get sick depressed. Why? You need to build up your inoculations. It wasn't the will of God for you to be depressed. God says that I have I have a good plan for you. Why? So that you don't get into depression so that you you prosper. And last time I checked, depression doesn't prosper you. Depression hurts you. [Applause] You too many weak Christians. It's not me, it's the word. I'm too many weak Christians. But we need to build up. We need to exercise. We need to get stronger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let me skip. It's the same message. He says, uh, you can't have, paragraph 108, you can't have life only through Christ. And now what does his words do? Builds up our spiritual body strong as we commune with him. Why? To resist the devil. You wonder why you keep falling to the same sin over and over. Fellowship and communion with God. Communion with God. You only pray maybe once after two months. Once after two months when you pray, you never hear back from God. &gt;&gt; Because communion is when both of you are communing. You talk to him and he talks back to you. &gt;&gt; That builds up your body. This is why Paul is telling Timothy, exercise unto godliness, confidence to all things. I encourage you to to to commune with God or Friday, Thursday or Saturday. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of us even, you know, we have Thursday night's prayer. &gt;&gt; We have Friday night's Bible study &gt;&gt; and some have zero excuses not to be at church and you wonder why you are weak. Zero excuses. You know that that what I mean I'm pretty sure if you know that look look at Delila and Samson she went after Samson's strength and that's what the devil does he knows the word is your strength he knows communion with God is your strength &gt;&gt; because when you bought it it doesn't mean you're not saved. You protect so many little baby and the devil can just slap you every time he wants. But the devil is an abuser. Only abusers who can't slap babies. &gt;&gt; But the devil is an abuser. &gt;&gt; He keeps abusing you. But he knows there's a secret pill somewhere with God. Only if this child start communion more with God. Then what he does you away from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had a job that maybe paid you like 25 an hour and with that job you could come to church and I was like let me give him let me just add $5. And that way you just have to do a little bit. You just have to work till 7 p.m. maybe. And we fall for stuff like that. When the Bible told us that when you put God first, I was reading listening to a message today. The prophet says always put God first. You'll never get ahead of him anyway. put him before you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've always kept you before my feet that I may not sin against him. That's why we fall. We don't have the Lord in front of us. If God is in front of us and you see that God is right there, I don't think you're going to sin. Amen. You will be scared. But sometimes we are not scared when you think something is behind you. Like if I don't know a danger behind me, I'm just I'll do anything. But when you put God before you, he becomes your shield. He becomes your protection. He provides to all your needs. And even when the food runs out at home, provides. The problem is we are not patient enough. The prophet says that God loves to surprise his people. God loves to come in the last minute. We call each other. We call each other the bride of Christ. But the prophet says, "Is that what the husband loves to do to his wife? Surprise her a little bit." [Music] And he says that's the same thing that God loves to do to his wife. But when we start seeing that our savings account go down to $1. Oh my god, I got to find me a job. I don't care to church. How am I going to survive? You've put the Lord behind. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is my everything. &gt;&gt; God is my healer. &gt;&gt; God is my provider. He is my savior. The reason a lot of thoughts keeps coming to my mind. The reason why the prophet says God allowed sin to come in so that you will know that he's a healer. you know that he's a provider. Sorry. So, so maybe things have come your way so that he can show himself that he is a provider to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. So some things God allows that to come your way so that he you know that he's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't we have a lot of testimonies in the church? &gt;&gt; Ask yourself that question is are we serving the same God of the Bible? Don't look at your neighbor. Look at yourself. Why are we not having testimony testimonies in this church? God or a living God. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I hope you understand this the right way. I don't mean any offense here, &gt;&gt; but sometime it even gets to me. I'm like, why does it seem like I like it feels like sometime I even refrain myself from giving testimonies because I feel like I'm the only person giving testimonies. God, the prophecy of God loves to show off. &gt;&gt; I had a situation at work yet, but I'm still going to talk about it. Like, I was talking to my manager because I'm a contractor right now. contractor. &gt;&gt; I've been doing so good at my company. I've been doing really good at my company. &gt;&gt; Like everybody sees my value and my manager is really pushing for me to get converted to full-time. No full-time. And then yesterday, yesterday he was talking to me in a meeting &gt;&gt; and he's like, "I really want to uh I'm trying I'm trying my best to get you to get converted to full-time, &gt;&gt; but it seems like it's nearly impossible in this company for people to get converted to full-time. Nearly impossible." And when he said that, &gt;&gt; I got excited when he says it's impossible. &gt;&gt; Even though it hasn't happened yet, in my heart, I say glory to God. I know that my God specializes in what? The impossible. My God specializes in the impossible. You know, that was yesterday. It hasn't even happened yet. But I'm giving a testimony ahead of time because I know that my God cannot fail. I will give you the desire of your heart to get converted to a full-time position. I have been praying to get converted to a full-time position. you know, and it hasn't even happened, but I see it moving. &gt;&gt; But I don't need to wait for that thing to happen in order to give a testimony because a lot of us, a lot of people are afraid to testify. They're like, "What if it doesn't happen? &gt;&gt; What if it doesn't happen?" &gt;&gt; Well, it's not my job to make it happen. It's now my job to make it happen. The Bible says that as long as in your heart you know that your motive and objective is right and your heart condemns you not everything you will and it will be given to you. We don't have a lot of testimonies because a lot of us are waiting to see the result. God, God loves Abraham spoke of things that be not as though they were. Abraham, you are the son of Abraham speaking things into existence. the unseen into the sin. What doesn't exist into existence. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait. It's not your job to bring the word of God to pass. The prophet of God says that if if God doesn't keep his word, then he's not God. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to boast as if I have more faith than anybody. I'm not trying to boast as if I have more more faith than anybody, but remember in the court you're into a better spiritual condition than you were in yesterday. &gt;&gt; So you need to now it's like you don't have to wait. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a specific thing. I come to church, praise the Lord. I asked for this, God gave it to me. That's not a lie. That's not a lie. &gt;&gt; The world is groaning for the manifestations of sons of God. The sons of God is the seed of Abraham. those people that don't for things to come to pass to give glory to God says I know my God can deliver me [Music] but it says that even if he doesn't deliver me I will not bow down to you as God for specific things. I have a testimony to give to the church. I ask God to heal me of this and I thank the Lord for it. &gt;&gt; Whether his answer is yes or no. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whether his answer is yes or no, I'm still going to give glory to God. You have to wait for that thing. That's faith. The song says, "Even though I don't see him, he's still moving." &gt;&gt; We are a generation that doesn't have to wait for the scene. A man that has not seen. You have here heard the word. Lord, I take your word and I'm going to testify of it. Why God sent you to be a worshshiper of God. How do you worship him? By testifying his word, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Even though I don't see it, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Even though I may not physically have it in my hand, but I have it because I have the hand of God. If God has it is in in his hand, then I have it in my hand. If God has it in his hand, then I have it in your hand. &gt;&gt; We are living in an age where God wants to be one with his bride. The prophet say God does God does the prophet says God doesn't have any other hands by your hands. Any other eyes but your eyes. He has your eyes. God already sees it. What are you waiting for? &gt;&gt; What are you waiting for? Just go forth with the word is mine. Victory is mine. Deliverance is mine. Deliverance is mine. Whoever the addiction is mine is mine. Desire in my heart is mine. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait. &gt;&gt; That's completely off my note. But God doesn't want you to wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm telling you, bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; If you start coming ahead of time and you start giving testimonies ahead, we will move in this church. A lot of people, we are afraid, afraid to trust God. that that I rebuke that spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; I rebuke that spirit of fear in the name of Jesus Christ. All those things that are holding you from giving testimonies to the gospel, Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word makes you free whether you want to. You are free to give God the glory. You don't have to wait for someone to tell you to give God the glory. Someone who is free doesn't have to wait. I am telling you that your chains are broken. I am telling you that your chains are broken. &gt;&gt; You need to act like it. &gt;&gt; You need to start acting like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Satan is nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; Satan is a liar. He's going to make you feel like you are still in chains. What I'm preaching today, is it the word of God or not? &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, is that the word of God or not? What word says that the word has what? He that the son has set free. I will let you speak thy yourself. He that the son has set free. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is power and death, life and death in the tongue. &gt;&gt; You have to say it yourself. I'm not going to say it for you. &gt;&gt; He that the son has set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you believe that you are free, you are free. If you believe that you are free, Satan cannot stand against you. You are free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give God the glory. &gt;&gt; Give God the glory. It's like you are free. &gt;&gt; The chains of Satan are broken. &gt;&gt; Your addictions are broken. &gt;&gt; You are free. &gt;&gt; You are sons purchased by the blood of God. He did not die on the cross so that you can be still in chains. What did he say when he was on the cross? And when he died, he says, "It is finished, &gt;&gt; Lord." I still feel like I'm battling this thing. It is finished, &gt;&gt; Lord. I want to grow in my nature with God. It is finished. Why? Because if the Lord is your portion, it is finished. &gt;&gt; If the Lord is your portion, it is finished. That's why the angel told John it's the book. The word want to become you. &gt;&gt; The word want to become your portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's let's get back into the topic. talking about being fit for the task that is at hand. Being fit for the task. &gt;&gt; The prophet in the message is thinking on our ways. You know sometimes we may not be fit for the task that God has sent you. you know exactly but it's it's because of yourself and I'll give an example of someone one time duty that he was supposed to do of God but he was not fit for duty. &gt;&gt; It was our prophet William Brham. It was our prophet William Brham. &gt;&gt; You know, I'll I'll paragraph but I'll I'll paraphrase by reading from the message. Thinking thinking on our ways. I had a confession to make myself. I was I was in my home and some people had been bothering me day after day [Music] and a big office and they were and and just had me so worried. I didn't know what to do. Finally, I was felt like the world was pulling me the top of my head out. I was so nervous and I couldn't leave to go to meetings and meetings waiting and hundreds of Christians and paragraph 90 and I had went home to eat my dinner. They told me I could I could be off the afternoon and I was going to catch up on some of my sick calls. and there was the phone ringing. It was my private phone. My wife went to the phone and she uh went to the phone and she picked up the receiver and she answered and when she did, she held Sorry, my bad. My wife went to the phone and she picked up the receiver &gt;&gt; and she answered and when she did she she said Billy it's them attorneys again [Music] and I said I can't go through it another half a day and I said I've told them that same thing over and over and over and over day in and out and day and so the prophet was frustrated let prophet You know this he said I was very nervous. Be careful what that spirit of nervous nervousness can get to you. And he says so many people waiting to be prayed for. So he had he wanted to go pray for people but because he let nervousness get the best of him. I said I said tell them I'm not in here. and run around behind the house. And when I'll come back in a few minutes, my precious little wife standing in the door, she looked at me and I know what she meant when her eyes caught mine. She She said, "Billy, was that just exactly right? That's the type of wife that you need. That's what a good wife is when you because it's it happens. We can get a fall. But you need a partner that helps you and you need to be humble to accept it too. Say you know you know how you like to justify. So the prophet says, you know how you you like to justify yourself. I said, "Oh, sure. I wasn't in here." &gt;&gt; So let me explain to some people that may not understand. So I am in the pulpit here and brother Isaac picks up the phone. What? He covered the phone. He's like, "What should I tell what should I tell them?" The prophet says, "Okay, wait a minute. Give me a second. let me go here and tell them I'm not there. That's what the prophet exactly did. I've actually done that myself too. You know, sometime you want to lie for something. But you have to make sure you're in a position where that lie becomes the truth, but it's still a lie. And then um and the wife says she said Billy are you sure of that? &gt;&gt; So wives don't be scared when your husband is getting out of line. Bring him ask him are you sure that [Music] the prophet said and I started out and I got my hats and I went down to make a sick call and I went into the room to pray for a little sick baby. man had been waiting a long time with this baby. So God had a task for the prophet. This baby had been waiting for a long time and I went in to pray for it. And when I started to lay my hands on it, something said to me, "Lay your lying hands on that child. Do you Yeah. [Music] You know the Bible says in 1 John 3:21, "If our hearts condemn us not, then we have then we have confidence in God. [Music] say what that the Christian church can get anything done. You know the Bible says you have not because you ask not [Music] but because you believe not because you have a condemnation in your heart it's hard for you to believe. Amen. And then u and the prophet says is because our hearts are condemning us with unconfessed sins. That's probably why we don't have a lot of unconfessed sins. When you start exposing the devil then light will have its way in your life. &gt;&gt; He says it's not easy for me to tell this but it's the truth. That's the way to be truthful. And I started to pray again. And I seen I wasn't fit to put my hands on that baby. So there was a task for the prophet, &gt;&gt; but he was not fit for the task that was at hand. I wonder how many of us you don't even know. Maybe there is a sick baby that's been waiting for you for a long time. Maybe there's been a situation that's been waiting for you for a very long time and you show up to it unprepared. show up there not ready that God could have asked that baby to go somewhere else to get to get prayed for that baby still waited imagine that you know &gt;&gt; there could be there are not there could be there are God has a work for each one of us &gt;&gt; and eventually we'll catch up with to it we'll catch up to it But you got to be ready. You got to make sure that you are fit for it. Imagine they go ask they ask you to go speak in front of mill of a million crowd. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the sound engineer only had one job. The sound engineer only had one job. and when you saw up there the sound engineer forgot to bring his mixer &gt;&gt; and his speakers and everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's showing unprepared and unready. &gt;&gt; The time is going back. Let me skip a little bit. And then how does God prepare us? &gt;&gt; He brings trials. You know, he brings trials. God allows trials to come our way to make sure we are fit for the task to shape us into the image that he wants us to be. In the message here, we have no continuing city. Paragraph paragraph uh 65 I believe the prophet talks about his baby Sharon Rose. &gt;&gt; He said and she was suffering so hard till one of them little fat legs was moving up and down in in a spasm &gt;&gt; and looked like her little hands was waving. And when she looked at me, she was suffering so hard till her little eye crossed when crossed. And when I see that tender little blue baby eye cross, I didn't know it then, but I understand it now. &gt;&gt; He was going through a trial. He said he didn't understand it there, but now he understand why he had God allow him to see his baby with a crossed eye. G J he said there's never been a crossed aisle child come in line by what I think of that &gt;&gt; you know but there's never been one pass over the platform that but what's being healed too &gt;&gt; so the prophet is saying that every child that came to the prayer to the prayer line with cross child I mean cross eyes was healed I didn't know the crushing head to bring it forth, you know, but I never think of it till I see that. &gt;&gt; How many how many of us we we we don't know the crushing that's coming upon us. It's there to bring a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know how to interpret that. But it's to bring to bring to bring out a purpose, you know. You can come back here. Yeah. Come help him. Your voice is gone. Okay. Just try. Thank you. [Applause] I didn't know the crushing had to bring it forth. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through things and we start complaining. If only God could show us the future. [Music] You know there's a purpose for everything. Even what just happened here happens just like that with God. &gt;&gt; So let I will start wrapping up. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; So God has a task for his bride was looking for you know and The task for us is to be the bride of Christ. That's what God is calling us into. &gt;&gt; So let's read Matthew chapter 22 might be a little bit &gt;&gt; because like I said he has an image that he wants he wants us to to come into. And what he did is he sent his messenger with a recipe. William, come over here in my image. &gt;&gt; I want my brides to look just like here's everything you need. Go get the bride. &gt;&gt; So where what scripture did I say? Matthew 22:1-4. And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables. and said, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, &gt;&gt; and sent forth his servants to call them that were beaten to the wedding, and they would not come." Again, he sent forth other servants, tell them which are beaten, &gt;&gt; behold, I have prepared my dinner, You know, he's inviting them come unto the Mary, &gt;&gt; but they made light of it. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you make light of the what the messenger is telling? The messenger tells you come to the wedding. You do. They didn't go to the wedding. &gt;&gt; So, they did the opposite of what the messenger was. Every time you do the opposite of what this message is telling you, you are going away from the wedding. And the remnant took his servants and intreated them spitefully and slew them. Which verse? Verse six. &gt;&gt; And verse eight, then say he to his servants, &gt;&gt; the wedding is ready. But they which were beaten were not worthy. Then go ye therefore into the highways. And as many as you shall find bid to the marriage. So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good. &gt;&gt; I'm glad they said both bad and good. Because some of us were bad. If they were just going for the good, they probably wouldn't get me. Let me show that God didn't just settle with the good people. But he says, didn't he say, "I came not for those that are whole, but I came for physicians." And the wedding was furnished with guests. And when the king came in to see the guest, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment. So this man was not fit in the past. He heard the message. So hearing the message of the hour is not enough. and he even came all the way to the wedding. &gt;&gt; He went all the way to to brotherly kindness. But he was missing the wedding garment is when you wear the full perfect some it's good to shout the prophet says you only do those things because you have faith but that's not enough. You got to keep going. This man was not fit to be the bride because to be to be the bride you had to wear the garment. What is the is the godly nature that nature Paul is telling us to exercise our faith. And notice the Bible says the bride made herself ready. No. Then said the king to the servant, buy him hand food. And so pretty much they threw in for many called but few are children. Many have heard the message of the hour build built up churches of like 300 people. Some left the message. Some have come all the way. But they just got tired. I'm so tired. I keep hearing about the Lord is coming. We just keep going to church. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm tired. I'm tired, you know. &gt;&gt; But they fail to miss that last part there is Christ himself &gt;&gt; because Christ is God is love. You know, you know this thing, this man came all the way, but he was missing perfect love. The recipe to his messenger, the right measurement. The message of the hour has the right measurement you need to make yourself. And he's giving you this this measurements. And he says, "Go by the dress. But you know what I love? &gt;&gt; Because you notice God went to those nobodies. They don't they didn't have any money. We we didn't have nothing. God gave us uh the the prophet gave us the the the instruction. go buy and then when we go to buy that thing the person that's selling it to us &gt;&gt; tells us that Isaiah 551-2 buy wine and milk without money and without price. But you know these people they believed somehow they didn't have money but they believed with nobody's going to the marriage of the king &gt;&gt; but they still believe they still obey the voice there is reward when you obey to the voice of God and the way God says this is that they don't have to pay anything they told them that that dress has already been purchased the blood of the lamb Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'll just uh end there. &gt;&gt; You know, and the first line in the recipe, &gt;&gt; he's telling us that though your sins may be as be though your sins be as scarlet, [Music] &gt;&gt; they shall be white as snow. &gt;&gt; Though they be red like crimson. They shall be as who? &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what your past was. It doesn't matter when God Jesus calls you. It doesn't matter who you were before. I am a living present God in your life. Daily you live in the presence of God. You may stand. Hallelujah. There &gt;&gt; there is a task that is at hand. &gt;&gt; Each Christian has a duty that he has to fulfill. &gt;&gt; But you got to exercise yourself. &gt;&gt; You have to get ready. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me be ready. The bride made herself ready and the enemy is going to distract you from getting ready for the task that we one task &gt;&gt; is to make you to the right and the devil is going to make sure he distracts you from that because when God when Christ came, you know, He was like a thief in the night to those that didn't they weren't watching. &gt;&gt; The prophet says that Jesus only comes for those that are looking for Lord. Help me get ready. Lord, I want to be the bride that you envision. Make me after your will. Anything that is in me that's against your word, take it out. &gt;&gt; Lord, maybe I'm just at my faith level yet. Add virtue unto me. &gt;&gt; Lord, maybe I just have virtue. Lord, I have temperance. I wait up on the Lord. Because when you wait up on the Lord, So you know when you work out proper sleep so that your muscles be built. When you wait on the Lord are renewed. Then whenever I wait on the Lord then add on to me godliness and brotherly kindness and above all Lord. Because if I have all this and I don't have you, &gt;&gt; I pray that next time you come to church hopefully, but the word of God get in a place ago even a few hours ago. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we thank you for your word. &gt;&gt; Lord, heavenly father, Lord, your word will not return void duty for us to fulfill and you want us to get ready Lord. Many a lot of us have been slack, lazy. You have given us all the tools to be ready. Lord, help us to eat your word daily. Help us to commune daily with you so that we may build resistance against the devil. Lord, I pray that you bless this church and I pray that heavenly father, Lord, you make yourself p personally known to each and every one of them. Lord, I'm really crying out that each and every one of them have a special experience with you. That when they come to church, they don't have to wait for people to ask them to sing. They need to be told to pray to be stimulated to say amen. But what you have done for them is enough to get them to say amen. what you have done for them is enough to get them to sing, enough to get them to worship. Lord, I break the tears of the enemy. And I pray that the spirit of God move freely in this place of Jesus and that you penetrate the hearts, the deepest places of the heart, and those places where there are darkness, I pray that you shine your lights there, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Came to church quite tired. We appreciate the help. [Applause] I like that. I like that. I got my portion. I trust everybody else. We ask the Lord to give us something to thank God for the brother. thought he was getting off track, but he wasn't. It was God. Do me like that. Hold to your notes. I think God he trains us that way. He'll make us write and then not use any of them. Don't think it's a failure. It's all God. We thank the Lord for everything. Thank God for the baptism on Sunday. The hotel people were very kind to us. A little glitch we came through. Oh, thank you brother for this is last minute. You know I I text brother Sam. [Music] I know you enjoyed it. One thing I more than one thing I really enjoy the reason why we don't testify is because we got sess. No use in being ashamed of the glory. Tell God about it. The Lord is worthy of testimony. If it ain't nothing but Lord, thank you for my life and strength. pray for us and I leave out in the morning. I mean Friday. &gt;&gt; So anyway, hello. &gt;&gt; So that I appreciate that brother. We do have prayer. Hello. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Does anybody have a testimony? Amen. Come on, brother. Amen. Amen. As brother is coming out. God bless you church. &gt;&gt; So basically prior to here coming here &gt;&gt; I didn't really want to say you know right in that corner um I did come with expectation. I prayed &gt;&gt; unexpect I think it was Tuesday. I was I don't know what I was doing. I was just praying. &gt;&gt; I asked God to reveal himself. I remember specifically I said Lord I said let Pastor Brooks preach &gt;&gt; and let me hear something. And then when I saw lease, &gt;&gt; I was a bit confused. I I was shocked because I still got the message. And if I were to write it down in a notebook, I'd probably have like 20 pages. I tried my best to write this testimony down. Um so basically &gt;&gt; after I asked God to reveal himself right started talking about depression in the US &gt;&gt; I think I think now Satan had been attacking me with depression and I hadn't [Music] it was hiding all inside my life and I never All I knew is I felt off. I never felt true happiness. It's like I had to force it. &gt;&gt; Around 14, I figured it out. &gt;&gt; But basically throughout this whole time, &gt;&gt; it was really hard to be happy. And only this year was the year that I realized that Jesus Christ broke all my chains. &gt;&gt; I was listening and I just started thinking down every testimony. I got four on this paper. So many were coming into my head. I just all out. But to give you guys a couple of testimonies. The first one I just want to thank God for every breath I take for allowing me to go to school. And a couple days ago, um, I signed up for a really hard class. &gt;&gt; AP World History and um, &gt;&gt; AP World History. &gt;&gt; I was stressing over I was like, "God, I'm not smart enough for this." I didn't study. ideas about the third day of school. I hadn't studied at all. So, my peers would be ahead of me. &gt;&gt; And I picked up the book and I was ahead of them. I don't know how it happened. Let me see. I have bad handwriting, so I'm sorry. Um, what else? What else? What else? Um, so this this gonna be my last one, but &gt;&gt; this one kind of goes back to my journey as a Christian. Before I came here, I had a Muslim friend who tried to convert me. The words that he was speaking or [Music] &gt;&gt; so I started talking to my pastor. I asked him multiple questions on and then eventually I got over that and then I started looking at brother Brandham. probably knows it but I didn't want to believe in brother Brandham because my dad believes in him to have faith because I had a personal experience. &gt;&gt; Now the devil I was listening to I don't even know which Sherman it was but he was healing people in the he was saying all sorts of good stuff like this doubting why you already won it's already my he came into my head he was like I could also heal the sick now I had read my Bible that day and it said something like cannot stand if it cast itself down or something like that a kingdom cannot stand in the book of Matthew if it cast itself down. &gt;&gt; So the healing that brother Brandham was doing There was no way the devil could have done that. The devil can't cast himself out. It doesn't like that have read the word that day. I would have had a much harder day. Thankfully, God helped me. And never been to this level in my life where I can hear God and I can hear spirit. Even when I'm praying, I've never I've never experienced it before, but I'm just hearing voices. I'm just brings me so much joy because here I could share it to my little brother Sam. I could share it to my friends. And that's the job that I believe God wants us to do. a great gift of God every single day. If you found a million dollars, you would tell your friends about it, right? I found somebody who could I found somebody who can take my life from being depressed knowing it was depression. from being anxious. He can change all of it just like this. &gt;&gt; I cannot hide this. I can't keep &gt;&gt; I had never known before I came here. I had this testimony. I don't want to say it. Is like many of you guys here have testimonies. I'm like, that was the second time God spoke to me. I can't cuz it would be if I had all this. &gt;&gt; So that's the message I wanted to share. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. My brother, &gt;&gt; I I'm not used to speaking on the mic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, but I'm going to try to say something &gt;&gt; sometimes. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't like to to speak on the mic. I just want to say to our pastor &gt;&gt; that God has done a lot of miracles in this church. &gt;&gt; God is doing a lot of miracles in this church. Maybe people just don't want to testify that way. But I want to say that God is in this church and every one of us always has those miracles happening to you. But it's always it's always people who are um just shy. They don't want to test talk about their testimony. &gt;&gt; And I'm one I'm one of those people that don't want to testify &gt;&gt; and I can't just condemn people because I'm I just put myself in there as well. &gt;&gt; So when my when my job laid off a lot of people, And so I thought I would go back to college. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I was thinking I was like, if I go to college, so how am I going to figure out life? How am I going to work? How am I going to live with my family? &gt;&gt; And so I said, I'm going to try. &gt;&gt; And when when I went, &gt;&gt; it was not an easy thing to do. And so at a certain time I found myself with a lot of bills to pay while I was going to school. &gt;&gt; And so I was thinking where am I going to find money to pay all these bills? &gt;&gt; And so I I told myself I will just uh come to church and and just uh keep coming to church every Wednesday, Sundays and all every day that we have a service. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And on on a certain Wednesday on a certain Wednesday, I was thinking uh trying to figure out how to pay my bills. &gt;&gt; And so I said, "God's going to take care of it. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to keep going to church." And then so I came here and after service, I went home. Then I was still thinking about how am I going to pay my bills. envelope. &gt;&gt; And so when I got home, I found my son Aaron. He brought all the mails, all all the all the mails &gt;&gt; and he put them on the table. &gt;&gt; And so I'm starting to read all the envelopes &gt;&gt; and I saw one envelope. &gt;&gt; I'm like, what's this envelope here? So I opened the envelope &gt;&gt; and the envelope &gt;&gt; and when I opened the envelope I saw a check in the envelope. &gt;&gt; And so I was wondering where where did where who sent this check? So the job that laid me off, they already paid all the checks. They already paid everything. They had no debt. And so I saw that it's the it's an old job that I worked before that sent me a check &gt;&gt; and that money allowed me to pay all the bills that I have. &gt;&gt; And so that's why I want to I want to give glory to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the second testimony, &gt;&gt; we have a lot of testimonies here. my son Neville. &gt;&gt; So one day I I woke up, my son Neville, I saw him limping. &gt;&gt; And so I asked him, "Why are you limping?" &gt;&gt; He said, "There's no way I I can't even put his shoes on." Then I asked him, "What's going on?" Then I I told him, "Show show me your feet." And so when he showed me his feet, &gt;&gt; I I couldn't even look twice. There's there was a lot of uh there's a lot of wounds under his feet there. &gt;&gt; And so I was wondering what is that? &gt;&gt; He said, "I went to the hospital. They said they have to put stuff on." And they said they've never seen something like that on my on the feet. And so we tried everything we could at home and and nothing was worth it. I forgot it. I forgot about it for some time and I was not even looking at it. &gt;&gt; And so I asked him one day again, "How how's your feet? How's your food doing?" &gt;&gt; And then he says, "It's getting it's getting worse." And so when I looked at his feet, I said, "Show me your feet." &gt;&gt; When he showed me his his foot, I was like, "It was worse." and so he was still wearing his shoes going to work with pain in his in his foot and when I tried to touch when I tried to touch his foot he wouldn't even let me touch his foot because there was a lot of pain there was a lot of pain on his foot and so we said we're going to pray &gt;&gt; and so we couldn't get to a conclusion anymore &gt;&gt; and so he said because we can't find it oursel we're going to put God to the test And so we woke up one day, we said University of Iowa, &gt;&gt; we're going to go to the University of Iowa. &gt;&gt; And so when we got there, &gt;&gt; we we got to the emergency room &gt;&gt; and the doctor came and he said he's never seen something like that before. He said they have to study this thing. &gt;&gt; Some people said it's cancer. Some people said it's And so they said, "We're going to call another department. Maybe someone has seen this before." And so we waited there one hour. &gt;&gt; We waited for an hour for a doctor to come from a different department to to take a look at. And so a mother, a elderly woman, she came, she came and she saw &gt;&gt; she just spent about 10 minutes and she said, &gt;&gt; she said, "It looks like I've seen this before, but &gt;&gt; but I'm going to give you some prescriptions." She told us there's &gt;&gt; she told us there's just just one one place, one lab where you can find these prescription prescriptions. &gt;&gt; And he said it's in Iowa City here. &gt;&gt; And when we got there and so when we got there, they said no one sent anything from the University of Iowa in this lab. And &gt;&gt; so we had to go home. So we went home. And so I asked and so I asked Neville, "Okay, can you call that lab and to see if they still sent something from the university?" Then he called then he called. They said, "Oh, they actually sent something here. It cost $98." &gt;&gt; Then it said, "Nevil, can you buy this?" Then Neville said, "But because the doctors were not really sure, we can't spend this much money on this." &gt;&gt; Then I told him, "No, just buy it. But with this prescriptions, you're going to get healed." And &gt;&gt; so we bought these prescriptions. &gt;&gt; We brought the prescription medicines &gt;&gt; and he put it on his foot. In just one week, he was completely healed. [Applause] And the wounds uh started to to get worse. The wounds started to to get healed. And there were there were there were fluids that were coming off of those those wounds. And now and so all those flu fluids that were in there uh hidden in there were started to come out and the the wound the wound started to get healed. &gt;&gt; And as we speak he's completely healed. &gt;&gt; May God May God receive his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. While we're at it, anybody else? &gt;&gt; Yes. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um, yesterday after work, &gt;&gt; I got home. I was tired, &gt;&gt; but I felt the need to talk to my younger siblings because I'm never home. Then when I get home, So, I called my younger brother Sam and since school had started, I just wanted to check up on on him and see how he was doing at school. wanted to talk about. &gt;&gt; And then he started sharing with me how like at school there's some kids that bully him. He said and that he sometimes like he also felt depressed &gt;&gt; like thinks about like taking his own life &gt;&gt; and he was just venting to me. He was crying, expressing himself. And I was just &gt;&gt; I was talking to him and I was telling him about how he's about to start high school and that if he doesn't find God, he won't be able to have that assurance that he doesn't need um anybody's validation at school. Yes. I was trying to build him up, tell him that he doesn't need, you know, help from nobody. He has God. He has us at home. Anybody? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell him that and then I pray for him &gt;&gt; and I I ask God to to help him see him to help you know Sam see him in his life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I asked God that Sam starts to have a relationship with God. Start. So we come to church today. &gt;&gt; Least talks about depression in America. &gt;&gt; And then he talks about how um in order to overcome that you need that communion with God. You need to have that relationship. So I'm in my head I'm sitting there. I'm like that's what I prayed for. &gt;&gt; I asked God to show himself. I wanted to see the hand of God in Sam's life. &gt;&gt; I wanted to see him happier. So I'm I'm sitting there. I'm like God is speaking to me, but I'm wondering is God speak is Sam getting the message? &gt;&gt; I want him to have a testimony as well. So, we're sitting there listening to everybody testify and he said, "Remember what we talked about yesterday? God did God did speak to him." So, that I mean that just shows that God hears. God, you know, God God touched Sam. God see God. God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; I wanted to testify as well &gt;&gt; because I also keep a lot of testimonies. &gt;&gt; God is acting. God is acting in this place. First, I thank I thank the Lord for having Pastor Brooks &gt;&gt; in the in America here &gt;&gt; because that was our prayer when we left Africa. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he's he's a he's a simple man. He he's not he's not um like prophesying things like like other pastor like other pastors do sometimes as well. &gt;&gt; But then I I I discovered a power in in his simplicity. I saw a lot of things since I came to America &gt;&gt; and I saw with I saw a lot of things with the with his faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so that's why whenever I have something happening to me, I always come here so he can pray for me. &gt;&gt; And every time he's prayed for me, I've always received the solution to my problems. And maybe I'm going to take a lot of time, a lot of time if I have to talk about everything. I'm gonna I'm not going to testify about this year, but I'm going to start for last year. I remember &gt;&gt; and so I remember in my dreams I always saw I always had nightmares. I always saw death in my in my my nightmares. &gt;&gt; Every day when I sleep during the day, even during the night, if it's not me and in that death, it's my children, my husband. Remember, my family members, it was just people posting. That's what I was seeing. And so, I talked to a brother here in church. And that brother told me to see Brother Briggs. And he said, "If you have something, I want you to go see the pastor and he's going to pray for you." And it was on a certain Sunday we left church. I didn't even talk about it to my husband because I knew if I told my husband, he was going to uh discourage, discourage me, tell me not to talk. And so when everyone left, I went to the pastor's office and I found the translator and I spoke to the pastor &gt;&gt; and the pastor told me, "The devil is a liar and we're going to pray." The pastor prayed for me. And after we left this place that Sunday, &gt;&gt; I didn't tell anybody that I went to see Pastor Brooks to talk about those deaf deaf spirits. And so my husband told me and so my husband told me, "Okay, let's go shop in an African store." And so we went with the whole family. &gt;&gt; When we got home, said, "My son said, I'm tired. I'm going to go rest a little bit." &gt;&gt; And so the children were taking the all the all the all the the bags from the car. And &gt;&gt; so we said it was a Sunday. We were trying to get another fridge to keep our food fresh. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Okay, if I go home and and I and I rest, I'm going to be tired, so let's go to Sam's Club." Then my husband told Jar, "Okay, come to come with me." Then Jar said, "I'm I'm tired. I I need a rest." &gt;&gt; And so he told him to to remove all all the bags from the car. So he And so the children were standing behind the car, &gt;&gt; they were taking those bags from the car. &gt;&gt; And so the person who was in my husband who was in in the in the on the on the steering wheel, he thought that people the kids already took everything from the bag from the car. &gt;&gt; And so he said, "Well, we can go now. And so we said I told him, "Well, let's wait for the children to go to get inside the house so we can go." &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Oh, there's no problem because I'm I'm going to go forward. I'm not I'm not going to back up with the car." And so when he started the car, the um the he had he had the the shifter was was set to go to go to go to back up and not go forward. &gt;&gt; And so he the car was on a on a hill. So he had to go up with a little pressure there pressure. And so instead of going instead of the car to go forward, &gt;&gt; so the car backed back backed up &gt;&gt; and Pauline was on the other side and was behind the car and he was taking those things from the car and the car just went through &gt;&gt; very fast and so I don't know how dear how did dear God jump out of that place. We never we don't know what happened there. &gt;&gt; The car the car the car ran through everything that we all the bags that were there that were down behind the car there. There were also other cars behind us, &gt;&gt; but he didn't hit those cars. Now, Diego was on the other side. He was crying because his legs was hurting. And I told I asked him, "What's going on?" He says, "Well, you ran you ran through my legs." &gt;&gt; And so I asked him, "Can you still walk?" "Yeah, I can still walk." And And so he didn't his legs didn't were not broken or nothing happened to his legs &gt;&gt; and everything was good. And then so we were wondering maybe the camera saw us so the the cops will come will come &gt;&gt; and so it just happened like that. Nothing happened. And then so dear God my son after a couple minutes said well my legs are feeling fine. And so I thank the Lord because of the prayer that the pastor made that day. When my husband was was was shaking, I I I told him, "You know what I did when I was in church?" &gt;&gt; And I said, "I went to see the pastor to cast out those spirits of death." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so I thank the Lord. I thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; And that he blesses the pastor as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Glory to God. Love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's uh &gt;&gt; Did you have something, brother? No. Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The God is good here. You're right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Josh has a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm thinking if I should give it or not because of time, but I don't think I have. energy to do it any other times. &gt;&gt; Um well, prior to we just started school, my third and early this year, we had a new government come in, right? With how um my school works, I am a sponsored which I use for my research being given by the government. &gt;&gt; The new government that has come has decided to cut grants some research which is happening and unfortunately my grant was cut. Hey. So, so getting to the end of um last semester which is around March, &gt;&gt; sorry, May rather got the message that my grant had been catched. So that means no more money in terms of tipants, in terms of pay, in terms of research with my fees included, all of that that had been cut. Now I'm doing a PhD which is supposed to take five years and I'm in my second year and the grant has been cut. Now there's a dilemma of how I'm going to continue this speech. &gt;&gt; And when this happened, it's not just me, but a lot of students and lots of schools had their grants cut. My professor was really worried cuz um she had to have her grant cuts &gt;&gt; and I was part and she always kept asking are you okay? like and from the start I was never worried or shaking. &gt;&gt; Knowing me, I've always been one to let God lead. My whole life has been a testimony. and I'm still living in that testimony. So I told her, "Oh, I'm okay. I'm fine." I probably because my professor and my other colleagues were also asking, "How are you doing?" I was like, "I'm not even worried. Why are you guys?" Anyways, fast forward a bit to get into the summer. My professor sent me a mail and she's like, "Oh, &gt;&gt; there is this um organization giving grants. Can you help me write something so we can ask them to continue smog?" &gt;&gt; So I go ahead and I do that. So at this point I had already prayed putting the whole thing into the hands of God. &gt;&gt; And as long as it had gone before God that was it. I wasn't going to. &gt;&gt; So I left it and uh we wrote this grant and we sent it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So within the whole summer I was having an internship here. &gt;&gt; Yes. And every time I go online, I hear people, you know, afraid and scared, I'm going to go back to school. And I have some of my friends who were in the PhD as well, their programs and take a masters and had to go back home. I mean that's how bad it is. Like if your grant is cut like I don't have any other money or how to sponsor you. So you have to find something else to do. So it's like you're left stranded on your own and &gt;&gt; and a normal I mean you being in America you probably be depressed and all of that &gt;&gt; but then I've never had that for the joy he gives me. &gt;&gt; So during the se summer I got a message from a professor. She was like, "Hey Joshua, hey Joshua, congratulations. We got the grants." &gt;&gt; And at that point in time, I had forgotten what was even happen at all. So I look back like, "What?" I was like, "Oh, &gt;&gt; I was like, oh, that's that's good." And I just went that day. I was driving home. I was just I normally do. I praise God. As I said, my life is a testimony &gt;&gt; and I will keep praising him. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. I think that's that's it. &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and close with a little song here. [Music] I could stay here long and testify also, but maybe we'll keep it for Sunday. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just close with this little song. Come and dine. Amen. Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He invites his chosen people coming down. With his man a he doth feed and supplies our every need. Oh his sweetness up with Jesus all the time. Oh come and dine. The master call it come and dine. You may feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the multitude turned the water into wine. To the hungry calleth now come and die. Oh the disciples came to land. Thus obeying Christ command for the master called to them come and die.
