[21:31] as reading this isaiah 50:6 a few weeks
[21:36] ago and something about just kind of
[21:41] grabbed ahold of me and I wrote some
[21:43] things down I said someday I'm going to
[21:45] preach on this said no wasn't me so soon
[21:47] and by this there's these two verses I
[21:53] just I really enjoy I went through them
[21:54] word by word both of these verses here
[21:57] verse 1 and verse 2 and I just I'd like
[21:59] to speak kind of just go through slowly
[22:06] verse 1 begins with thus saith the Lord
[22:10] I think everybody here is listened to
[22:15] enough of the messages I don't think
[22:16] there's really any strangers amongst us
[22:18] this morning we've all heard the message
[22:20] we've heard what brother Branham and
[22:21] said we know what the voice is said in
[22:23] this day we've we've heard enough to
[22:26] know what we ought to do a man we've
[22:28] seen what what the commandment of the
[22:30] day is we've seen the warning for this
[22:34] day we've know what the warning is we
[22:37] know that what we are to look out for
[22:39] were we know what Mystery Babylon is
[22:43] trying to do we know the Satan is going
[22:45] about like a roaring lion we know where
[22:48] the world is headed we also know the
[22:51] mysteries have been revealed to us and
[22:52] the best mysteries have been revealed
[22:54] through the seven seals and and how we
[22:58] are to conduct our lives how we were to
[22:59] be filled with the Holy Ghost I would be
[23:02] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[23:03] Christ how we are to stand in the power
[23:06] of His Holy Ghost and how weird having
[23:09] done all that we can do to stand a man
[23:12] to stand in the power of the resurrected
[23:14] Messiah not to stand and in the religion
[23:18] of this world not to stand and the ideas
[23:21] of man not to stand in our own ideas but
[23:24] to stand throughly in what the Lord
[23:26] Jesus Christ has revealed unto us and
[23:28] whatever the Lord has revealed to us
[23:31] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:32] through the communion of face-to-face
[23:35] with him to stand within that revelation
[23:37] right there and whatever he says to do
[23:40] to do it wherever is thus saith the LORD
[23:42] to make sure
[23:44] that we stand with that and to do it
[23:46] when we see a thus saith Loris to revere
[23:49] that to watch over to keep it when when
[23:54] God speaks out thus saith Lord and no
[23:56] man can say thus saith Lord unless the
[23:59] Lord has said thus Amen you know men can
[24:02] go on our impressions and maybe you
[24:05] speak out in tongues and do this or do
[24:07] that but no man can say thus saith Lord
[24:09] unless the Lord has explicitly said this
[24:12] Amen and no man can take that upon
[24:15] himself unless the Lord has anointed
[24:17] that man and given him that office Amen
[24:20] but when a man comes forth saying thus
[24:22] saith Lord and every Christian I sit up
[24:25] and take heed and notice and watch and
[24:30] bless it is the generation that has
[24:33] enough saith Lord aleena Amen you know
[24:36] and and you own I think about this
[24:39] message and how things are balanced and
[24:42] how man can go too far one way or too
[24:45] far another way and some men will will
[24:48] go one way and then they'll neglect the
[24:50] one thing other people go the other way
[24:52] and neglect the other thing and then
[24:55] there but down right through the middle
[24:56] there is a right way you know and some
[24:59] men you know will will say well you're
[25:02] putting too much in a man or you're
[25:04] doing too much of this but we got to
[25:06] respect this thing we've been given a
[25:08] message we've been given a message
[25:11] through brother Branham brother bran was
[25:14] the prophet of our age we got to respect
[25:17] that and we got to respect the message
[25:19] that came through him when you see thus
[25:21] sayeth the Lord and we have to latch on
[25:24] to that we have to take our lives and
[25:27] and take that less say Florence say Lord
[25:29] what shall I do with this Lord how can i
[25:32] order my life around through this Lord
[25:34] lead me this way leave me that way Lord
[25:36] I want to be in obedience to what you
[25:38] have to say when we listen to the tapes
[25:40] we want to say and all sudden you see
[25:42] the Prophet saying something on the
[25:44] tapes and you look at your life and
[25:46] something your life is contrary to what
[25:48] is said on the tapes that we got to have
[25:50] respect to what the tapes say and we
[25:53] gotta have respect to do according to
[25:55] what that is why because we want to be
[25:57] in line with what the vision was for
[26:00] this day if there's a vision for how the
[26:02] bride is going to be when the great
[26:05] rapture is coming and the great rapture
[26:07] is coming amen the Lord is coming to
[26:10] take his bride away
[26:11] and the Lord Jesus Christ had a vision
[26:13] and he had a vision of what the bride
[26:16] what position she would be in when he
[26:18] comes back and then then so then he
[26:21] sends out a prophet with us say the Lord
[26:23] choose to give out the word just like he
[26:26] sounded thus saith the Lord let there be
[26:28] light and there was life there was a lot
[26:32] less say Florida heavens an earth was
[26:34] created there was a thus saith Lord
[26:36] where he spoke to the earth bring out
[26:38] all the trees and all the plants and
[26:40] sure enough the earth brought forth the
[26:42] trees and the plants there was a lot
[26:44] less say flora then went to the ocean
[26:46] once and said bring forth fishes and and
[26:49] although all these animals and of the
[26:51] sea and and sure enough the the sea
[26:54] brought forth fishes and swimming
[26:56] creatures one time with us say Florida
[26:58] went out to the air and all sudden there
[27:00] was birds flying through the air and one
[27:03] day the Lord said let us and God spoke
[27:06] to himself he said let us create man
[27:08] after our own image and man was created
[27:11] after the very image of God and that is
[27:13] what God is looking for when he comes
[27:15] God is looking for men and women when he
[27:19] comes back there created after the very
[27:21] image of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we
[27:24] are created in His image because we have
[27:25] been filled with this spirit a man we
[27:28] have submitted ourselves underneath the
[27:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost and we have
[27:32] been created from glory unto glory
[27:35] raising up into his image loving like he
[27:38] loved amen being godly like you is godly
[27:41] amen and going forth being led as Jesus
[27:44] said I do only that which pleases to the
[27:46] father whatever I see the father do that
[27:49] I do amen and that leadership is for
[27:52] every one that will submit themselves
[27:54] underneath the leadership of the Holy
[27:56] Ghost Savior amen if you do not have
[27:58] this leadership it's not very far off
[28:01] from you amen if you are lacking the
[28:04] leadership of the Holy Ghost it is not
[28:07] very far off from you this is not a this
[28:10] is not a
[28:11] strange thing this is not something that
[28:13] you have to go to college to learn this
[28:16] is not something that you have to go and
[28:18] and smite yourself for for years and
[28:21] years and think oh when will I get this
[28:23] thing know the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:25] is for you today as many has heard has
[28:28] believed as many as as me we're entering
[28:31] into that church that day as Peter
[28:34] preached the word the Holy Ghost fell on
[28:36] them amen when the disciples went forth
[28:39] laying hands on him and the Holy Spirit
[28:41] fell upon them as they were as the
[28:44] gospel is preached and as the elder is
[28:46] laid upon their hands why because the
[28:47] Holy Ghost was for them amen and now in
[28:50] this day the Holy Ghost is for you and
[28:52] let me speak to the children here as as
[28:54] me as the children here have come to
[28:57] this church and have lists into the
[28:59] gospel has been preached and has
[29:01] listened to how we preached the baptism
[29:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[29:05] I know some of our children have been
[29:07] baptized now in the name of Lord Jesus
[29:09] Christ I know some of our children right
[29:11] now are thinking about being baptized in
[29:13] the name of Lord Jesus Christ every
[29:15] person has been baptized in the name of
[29:17] Lord Jesus Christ has a promise and
[29:19] inheritance to enter into they've been
[29:22] given an inheritance thus saith the Lord
[29:24] thus saith the scripture there you
[29:27] repent and you are baptized in the name
[29:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ you go down
[29:32] into the water you are dead to your old
[29:34] ways dead to the sins of this world dead
[29:37] to the things that are wrong and you are
[29:39] alive now unto the Lord Jesus Christ the
[29:41] one that created the heavens and the
[29:43] earth the one that created us in his own
[29:45] image we are alive unto Him and when we
[29:48] are alive unto Him he says I will give
[29:50] you my own spirit it's a promise it's an
[29:55] inheritance
[29:55] it's thus sayeth the Lord I will give
[29:58] you of my spirit I will take out your
[30:00] stony heart of flesh I open it a new
[30:03] heart that will agree with me and I will
[30:05] take that heart and I will fill it with
[30:07] my spirit and you will go forth being
[30:09] led by the holy ghost and and the works
[30:13] of your father you'll do amen
[30:16] the works of the Lord the one same one
[30:18] that created the heavens in the earth
[30:19] the word his works you will do Amen why
[30:22] because you were led by the Holy Ghost
[30:24] amen and let me tell you of all I'm all
[30:27] my life you know as I get closer to 40 I
[30:31] think Lord my life's almost half oh if
[30:33] the Lord tarry you know the nature of
[30:36] man going to 80 years or whatever it is
[30:39] and I think Laura do my life's half over
[30:41] has this half of my life been pleasing
[30:44] to you I think Lord and all the things I
[30:49] wish I hadn't done all the foolish
[30:50] things lord I pray that those things
[30:52] will be smitten away as far as the East
[30:54] is from the West
[30:55] and lord I ask that there be eternal
[30:58] things that's every way every ways goal
[31:03] that that there will be eternal things
[31:04] that they have done where the Lord led
[31:07] them I want you to go here and do this I
[31:09] want you to go here and do that I want
[31:12] you to go here and do this things that
[31:14] they did in obedience to the scripture
[31:16] things they did in obedience to the
[31:18] leadership of the Lord things they did
[31:20] in obedience to the faithful pastor they
[31:22] preached and all these things that they
[31:24] did they did it in the name of the Lord
[31:25] Jesus Christ and those things will never
[31:27] be taken from me those things will never
[31:31] be taken from it
[31:32] those are eternal things even Jesus
[31:35] himself said if you give a couple of
[31:38] drink of cold water to someone to a
[31:40] servant of the Lord that man will never
[31:42] lose his reward just giving a cup of
[31:45] cold water that male will never lose his
[31:47] reward and we were as we read here in
[31:51] this verse it says thus saith Lord keep
[31:54] you judgment and do justice keep you
[31:58] judgment and do justice well what is
[32:00] judgment what is judgment first off when
[32:07] it says keep ye judgment we're keep you
[32:10] there means to attend to to guard to
[32:13] protect we have a judgment here we have
[32:17] to keep it we have to guard it he's
[32:20] saying thus saith Lord keep this guard
[32:24] this protect this he says keep e
[32:27] judgment the judgment there
[32:36] I want you to decide judgment is to make
[32:39] a verdict
[32:41] judgment is to make a decision when
[32:44] something is judged something is weighed
[32:46] in the balances and when something is
[32:49] judged its it's a verdict the decision
[32:51] that has been weighed in the balances
[32:54] the decision has been made the verdict
[32:57] has been passed either this is right or
[33:00] this is wrong
[33:00] and Jesus said thus saith Lord I want
[33:03] you to keep judgment I want you to do
[33:05] justice I want you to weigh the things
[33:07] in the balances once you decide is this
[33:10] right or hit now tell me how can a man
[33:12] ever decide whether something is right
[33:13] or something is wrong because we know
[33:15] that our own mind is faulting our own
[33:18] human mind can be can be swayed one way
[33:21] or the other way but the only way a man
[33:23] can really be keep judgment and to do
[33:25] justice the only way and era can weigh
[33:27] things in the balances as they take
[33:29] things to the Lord in prayer and
[33:31] whenever a man says Lord what should I
[33:34] do here what should I do there
[33:36] and you're taking things and you say
[33:37] Lord and you all sudden like say say you
[33:40] do something all sudden the Holy Spirit
[33:42] comes upon your heart what you did was
[33:44] wrong and you feel that conviction of
[33:46] the Lord and you say O Lord and you
[33:48] decide in your heart
[33:49] I either I'm gonna be in an agreement
[33:51] with the Holy Ghost or I'm going to be
[33:54] in disagreement with the Holy Ghost
[33:56] that's how we keep judgment when we are
[33:59] always watching what the Holy Spirit is
[34:01] is that does the Holy Spirit like this
[34:04] or does the Holy Spirit not like this
[34:06] when you're in constant communion with
[34:08] the Lord I think everybody knows what it
[34:10] feels like 8 any Holy Spirit fill
[34:12] believer knows what it feels like to
[34:14] grieve the Holy Ghost because that's
[34:16] that's what we do in our training ground
[34:18] that's what we do when we first get
[34:20] filled with the Holy Ghost you're in
[34:22] that training ground and you're and
[34:23] you're going about your daily life and
[34:25] also need to do something you've always
[34:26] done but all of a sudden you just oh I
[34:29] can't do that
[34:31] your last something I've always done my
[34:33] whole life but now all of a sudden now
[34:35] the leadership the Holy Ghost is
[34:37] checking me I feel this check in my
[34:38] heart and you're like oh that thing I
[34:40] always used to do now sudden I can't do
[34:43] that anymore what you're weighing things
[34:44] and the balance is you're judging them
[34:46] by the Holy Ghost by the conviction by
[34:48] the by the chimp
[34:50] the Holy Spirit by the communion of
[34:51] Christ I'll say you saying oh I can't do
[34:54] that anymore oh I don't want to grieve
[34:56] the Holy Spirit why because you treasure
[34:58] his presence because you treasure his
[35:00] communion you don't want to do anything
[35:03] that would grieve him you don't want to
[35:04] do anything that would hamper the
[35:06] communion between you and him you want
[35:07] to keep the way clean why because we got
[35:10] to keep the pathway between us in Christ
[35:12] clear why because we always want him to
[35:14] be able to come and to miss room he's
[35:16] going to come to you know that's the
[35:18] thing about it is that God is gonna come
[35:20] to his altar every day God is gonna come
[35:24] to his temple every morning his mercies
[35:27] are new every morning he's gonna come
[35:29] with the blood every morning he's going
[35:30] to come with a sanctification every
[35:32] morning he's going to come in with his
[35:33] righteousness every morning he's going
[35:35] to come every morning but but when the
[35:37] flus are all clogged up when you have
[35:40] the when you have something that's
[35:42] making desolation on the inside when you
[35:44] have something that's that's blocking
[35:46] then how can the Holy Spirit get there
[35:48] how can you ever get to the communion
[35:50] place how can he ever get to the meeting
[35:52] place but when you keep judgment when
[35:54] you're always weighing things in the
[35:56] balance by the baptism the Holy Ghost
[35:58] waiting thing is balanced with a with
[36:00] the with the with the pleadings of the
[36:04] Holy Spirit on the inside when he's
[36:06] pleading with you oh don't do this or go
[36:09] here and do this don't do this over
[36:11] there but do this over here and you're
[36:13] weighing things you're judging them by
[36:15] the leadership with the Holy Ghost amen
[36:18] thus saith Lord keep you judgment and do
[36:21] justice justice is righteousness it's
[36:25] the thing that is right so when you do
[36:27] judge whether things are right or wrong
[36:30] then you go and thus saith Lord you do
[36:32] the thing that is right why do we do it
[36:35] here it says in verse 1 he says because
[36:37] my salvation is near to come and my
[36:40] righteousness to be revealed
[36:43] Amen now when we think about that
[36:45] scripture there in Isaiah you only think
[36:46] about the day when when Christ came
[36:48] there as long as AEA's prophesies had to
[36:51] do with with the coming of Christ but
[36:53] but Christ comes every morning His
[36:56] mercies are new every morning he brings
[36:59] us salvation to us he brings the blood a
[37:02] new he he
[37:04] washes you clean he constantly daily
[37:06] daily he's coming to his temple where is
[37:09] this temple its temples right here
[37:10] he's coming every morning to his temple
[37:13] why his praises are sung there his word
[37:16] is kept there his his word is revered
[37:19] there and as simple and he comes to to
[37:21] commune with you there that's where his
[37:23] name this place that's where that's
[37:25] where that's where he longs to dwell is
[37:28] in his temple amen says so keep he
[37:32] judgment and do justice for my salvation
[37:34] as near to come my righteousness to be
[37:36] revealed
[37:37] amen his righteousness ought to be
[37:39] revealed in you amen we are to be the
[37:42] House of Prayer for All Nations we are
[37:44] the one to be the witness we are to be
[37:48] the ones that show righteousness to the
[37:50] world when the whole world is going
[37:52] wrong we are going right when the whole
[37:55] world is darkness we are the light how
[37:57] are we the light by the baptism of the
[37:59] Holy Ghost by his leadership down on the
[38:02] inside why because we have judged the
[38:04] things that are wrong and we have done
[38:06] the things that are right amen we've
[38:08] weighed the things in our life that are
[38:10] oh it wasn't it keeps the ways clean and
[38:13] clear Amen why so there could be a
[38:15] communion there let me tell you is
[38:18] attractive amen Christ is attractive
[38:21] amen when you when when when Christ was
[38:24] walking down through the earth here and
[38:26] the 2000 years ago he was attractive the
[38:30] things that he did were lovely the hid
[38:32] the sick were healed amen
[38:34] people were the unlovable were loved
[38:37] amen now he's he think wow how beautiful
[38:41] it was and you know every denomination
[38:42] you know they I think about how great
[38:45] the Messiah was but but here's the thing
[38:47] is can it be read can't be revealed
[38:51] again today a man can Christ be made the
[38:54] same today and he made the same he made
[38:57] the same yesterday today and forever
[38:59] amen Paul prophesied that Jesus Christ
[39:02] to be the same this day in January 2018
[39:06] that Jesus Christ to be the same in
[39:08] January this is Paul prophesied this
[39:10] 2,000 years ago that Jesus Christ would
[39:13] be the same in January of 2018 as he was
[39:16] back then when hero when
[39:18] Paul wrote that scripture there
[39:19] underneath the leadership the Holy Ghost
[39:21] he was anointed right Jesus Christ the
[39:23] same yesterday today and forever amen
[39:27] and here we are in this in this day
[39:29] knowing that any day that is called
[39:31] today Jesus Christ is the same a man
[39:35] what is today today is today amen
[39:38] therefore Jesus Christ is still the same
[39:40] he's bringing his righteousness he's
[39:42] bringing his purity he's bringing his
[39:44] pardon amen who here has prepared the
[39:47] way this morning for him to bring his
[39:49] righteousness is cured in his part amen
[39:52] how do you do it why by keeping me
[39:54] judgment and doing the thing that has
[39:57] wrecked amen
[40:00] let's go down to verse 2 there that we
[40:02] read actually before we do that before
[40:07] word you asked her the book of Zephaniah
[40:10] the book of Zephaniah there's a third to
[40:13] last book in the Old Testament
[40:15] Zephaniah chapter 3
[40:38] I don't want to dwell too much on the
[40:40] negative this morning but we're going to
[40:42] just go through this year for a moment
[40:45] Zephaniah chapter 3 verse 1 says woe to
[40:49] her that is filthy and polluted to the
[40:52] oppressing city she obeyed not the voice
[40:56] she received not correction she trusted
[41:00] not in the Lord
[41:01] she drew not near to God let's go down
[41:04] to the fifth verse though just Lord is
[41:07] in the midst thereof he will not do
[41:10] iniquity every morning does he bring his
[41:13] judgment to life he fail us not but the
[41:16] unjust knoweth no shame and I look at
[41:20] that fifth verse there the just Lord is
[41:22] in the midst thereof he's in the midst
[41:24] of the city who is Jerusalem today Amen
[41:29] that's us the just Lord the righteous
[41:33] Lord is in the midst thereof from the
[41:35] missile city he will not do iniquity
[41:37] every morning does he bring his judgment
[41:40] to light the Lord will decide what is
[41:43] right and what is wrong he fails not but
[41:46] the unjust knoweth no shame Amen why
[41:50] should they be ashamed because the Lord
[41:52] has brought his judgment in the morning
[41:54] the unjust the Lord and brings his
[41:57] judgment every morning but the unjust
[42:00] were not prepared to hear from the Lord
[42:04] they know no shame when the correction
[42:07] was brought they note knew no shame when
[42:09] correction was brought to the unjust
[42:10] they didn't know enough to repent and
[42:13] turn they did know enough they knew new
[42:15] assange so therefore how can they
[42:17] receive God's blessings every morning
[42:19] amen woe to her this filthy and polluted
[42:22] to the oppressing why is it a woe to her
[42:24] because she had a chance to be righteous
[42:27] she had everything was given to her to
[42:29] do that which was right and instead she
[42:32] did that which was wrong how so what was
[42:34] this what became of that she became
[42:36] polluted and filthy she became the
[42:39] oppressing City not only did she
[42:41] oppressed man she oppressed the Holy
[42:44] Ghost and that's every man that will not
[42:47] bow bow down and to leadership the Holy
[42:50] Ghost she
[42:51] the Holy Spirit she like Roy Brown says
[42:54] how can you how can you say revival in
[42:57] our day when the regular revival giver
[42:59] is bound you bound her by your
[43:01] traditions he said amen solo pressing
[43:06] city she didn't just oppress man but she
[43:08] oppressed the Holy Spirit she grieved
[43:10] the Holy Ghost how could the Holy Ghost
[43:12] came every morning to bring the
[43:14] judgement but because the oppressing
[43:16] city oppressed the Holy Spirit boy
[43:18] spirit could not bring judgment and
[43:20] justice to life
[43:21] hey man what I look at the look at the
[43:24] the four things that she did she she
[43:27] would not obey the voice remember thus
[43:30] saith Lord the Lord said to him buss
[43:32] saith Lord she didn't obey the voice and
[43:35] then she received not the correction the
[43:38] correction came to tell her don't do
[43:40] this do that but she would not receive
[43:42] that and she went on doing what she
[43:44] wanted to do anyhow and she trusted not
[43:47] in the Lord so so there whenever you
[43:50] receive not correction all sudden things
[43:52] begin going wrong amen there will be
[43:55] little hiccups along the road and then
[43:57] little hiccups become big hiccups and
[43:59] they get bigger and little sins become
[44:01] big sins and then all sudden you think
[44:04] Oh what should I do and you have a
[44:06] choice now as sin gives birth to or as
[44:11] as doubt gives birth to sin sing his
[44:13] birth to death amen and and then what do
[44:16] you do at each step of that warning sign
[44:18] you're supposed to turn and trust on the
[44:21] Lord but she did not do that she didn't
[44:23] receive correction so she trusted not
[44:25] into the Lord and the final thing she
[44:27] drew not near to her God as God brought
[44:30] the judgment to her his God brought the
[44:32] justice to her she had an opportunity to
[44:34] repent but she would not draw nigh to
[44:37] her under the law amen amen amen let's
[44:46] turn over to Deuteronomy chapter 16
[44:54] I think everybody you know I looked back
[44:57] to my life the things that I enjoy most
[44:59] most of my life is serving the Lord of
[45:04] all the things I've done in my life of
[45:06] all the things that give me pleasure all
[45:08] the things I look back in my years and I
[45:10] think oh they bring me joy life and
[45:13] sometimes why I was able to follow the
[45:15] leadership of the Holy Ghost and serve
[45:17] the Lord amen the the biggest burdens
[45:20] upon my life are the things I look back
[45:22] in my life and where Lord said to do
[45:24] this instead I went the other way the
[45:26] biggest disappointments I have in my
[45:28] life are the times I fail to do with the
[45:30] Lord asked me to do
[45:31] amen and and therefore and we are that
[45:34] we are all exam on those things because
[45:36] when we come down to the end of the road
[45:38] we have our we as we make our choices
[45:40] every day we get to decide how we want
[45:43] to leave this earth we're going to leave
[45:45] our earth this earth and disappointment
[45:47] or you want to leave or this earth and
[45:49] joy that we did the things that please
[45:51] the Lord amen Deuteronomy chapter 16
[45:55] read from the 18th verse and it says
[46:01] judges and officers shalt thou make in
[46:05] all thy gates which the Lord giveth thee
[46:08] throughout thy tribes and they shall
[46:11] judge the people with just judgment thou
[46:13] shall not rest judgment thou shalt not
[46:16] thou shall not respect persons neither
[46:20] take a gift for a gift of the blind the
[46:23] eyes of the wise and pervert the words
[46:25] of the righteous that which is all
[46:27] together just shalt thou follow that
[46:30] thou mayest live and inherit the land
[46:32] which the LORD thy God giveth thee amen
[46:36] think about the judges and officers
[46:39] shalt thou make in all thy gates every
[46:42] entrance into the city set a point of
[46:45] judgment what is a judge it's a wise man
[46:48] that knows how to decide between right
[46:50] and wrong amen every point every
[46:53] entrance into your spirit every entrance
[46:56] into your mind at every every at all of
[46:59] it you're at all of your senses of your
[47:01] of your sight your hearing of your of
[47:04] your of your touch all of your senses
[47:07] and your reasoning
[47:08] your affections of your conscience your
[47:10] memories set a judge right there decide
[47:13] is this thing right or is this thing
[47:15] wrong and what is that judge what does
[47:17] he draw from how does he get his
[47:18] judgment he gets it from thus saith the
[47:20] Lord he gives it from the leadership of
[47:22] the Holy Ghost when he's submitted under
[47:24] Christ you bring the things when you you
[47:27] set the judge at all the gates what's
[47:30] gonna come into my body and we sing that
[47:32] song Oh be careful little eyes what you
[47:34] see Oh be careful little eyes what you
[47:37] see for the father up above is looking
[47:39] down and love Oh be careful little eyes
[47:41] what you see Oh be careful little ears
[47:44] what you hear Oh be careful little ears
[47:46] what you hear for the father up above is
[47:49] looking down and look Oh be careful
[47:50] little ears what you hear we sung these
[47:53] songs as a child and in Sunday school
[47:55] but they're true we're supposed to set
[47:57] the judge at the gate no wicked thing
[47:59] was set before my eyes why so I can be
[48:02] ready too when the Lord comes upon the
[48:04] scene I'll be ready to do that what she
[48:06] asked me to do amen set the Sun set the
[48:09] judge up on the gates thou shalt not
[48:12] have respective fur person's either take
[48:15] a gift really a gift of blind the eyes
[48:17] of the wise and pervert the words of the
[48:20] righteous a man yo and when Satan who
[48:22] always likes to bring his little gift
[48:24] he likes to bring a little pleasure
[48:26] along your life something that feels
[48:29] good or looks good that's a that's a
[48:31] gift from the devil we bring something
[48:35] to you and you want it what does it do
[48:37] it perverts your judgment it perverts
[48:40] your decision-making when you say oh I'm
[48:42] going to do this because it feels right
[48:44] because and without seeking that and
[48:46] without judging it by the baptism of the
[48:48] Holy Ghost by the leadership of Holy
[48:50] Ghost when you take those things in you
[48:52] and you feel your flesh wanting to go
[48:54] towards the gift that Satan's bringing
[48:56] you wanting to go the direction because
[48:58] Satan has a lot of pleasures he'll bring
[49:00] across your path and he wants to yes a
[49:03] gift he's he's bringing she's putting
[49:05] something before you and trying to bring
[49:07] a gift before you and your flesh wants
[49:09] to set that direction but instantly
[49:11] because you have a judge at the gate
[49:12] there you decide you say Lord is this
[49:15] thing right or is this thing wrong is
[49:17] this thing going to hinder my communion
[49:19] with Lord is this thing gonna grieve the
[49:22] whole
[49:22] spirit of living God is this gonna be is
[49:24] this gonna bring pleasure to my lord or
[49:26] not bring pleasure to my lord amen and
[49:30] when you decide you set the judge at the
[49:33] gate brother Keith sets the judges of
[49:35] his gates brother Isaac sets the judges
[49:38] at his gates brother Troy brother Mike
[49:41] aye brother Samuel we all set our judges
[49:44] at the gates that there are interests as
[49:46] to our cities because we are one body
[49:48] Amen we take communion declaring the
[49:51] we're one body we are on one Accord we
[49:54] come here together into the service that
[49:56] the boy spirit might come down into this
[49:59] place and we are watching every day
[50:02] watching the things that go on in our
[50:03] body why so that we wouldn't bring
[50:05] something down to drag down the body of
[50:08] Christ amen so the body of Christ might
[50:10] be made whole we set the judges at the
[50:13] gates because we were careful to what
[50:15] enters into the gates of the body of
[50:17] Christ amen amen jesus said I judge
[50:22] everything that I see and I hear by the
[50:24] will of God and that's John John 5:30 a
[50:28] men a man when we read there and we read
[50:37] there in in Isaiah 56 verse 2 is said
[50:42] blessed is the man that doeth this
[50:46] blessed is the man that do things
[50:48] blessed is the man that listens to us
[50:50] say floored blessed is the man that
[50:52] keeps that judgment does justice because
[50:55] his salvation is ready to come his
[50:56] righteousness to reveal he said in verse
[50:58] 2 blesses the man that doeth this and
[51:01] the son of man the lathe hold on that
[51:03] keepeth the Sabbath's from polluting it
[51:05] they keepeth his hand from doing evil
[51:07] how do we keep the Sabbath in this day
[51:10] how do we keep the Sabbath in this day
[51:12] when we rest from our works and we lean
[51:16] on the works of Jesus Christ when we
[51:18] follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[51:20] that's how we keep the Sabbath and you
[51:22] cannot keep the Sabbath in this day
[51:24] unless you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:26] no man can keep the Sabbath in this day
[51:28] by being fitme by three fill with the
[51:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:32] how does he keep the Sabbath he keeps
[51:35] the Sabbath by
[51:35] doing that which the Lord leads to him a
[51:37] man was he do he keeps his hand from
[51:39] doing any evil he judges it is this
[51:42] thing gonna lead me closer to Christ is
[51:45] this thing of the Lord or is this thing
[51:47] not of the Lord is this thing the
[51:48] Satan's starting to bring my path to get
[51:50] me to go this way or is this something
[51:52] Christ is bringing to my path amen
[51:56] I was thinking about a this morning
[51:59] about a seared conscience you know once
[52:03] a conscience has been seared it's it's
[52:06] branded it's it's sealed off it's it's
[52:09] lost a sense of touch its loss of sense
[52:12] of feeling it's no longer sensitive the
[52:15] whole the Holy Spirit when a conscious
[52:18] when a man's conscience is seared he is
[52:20] no longer since if he has disobeyed for
[52:23] so long in one particular spot that his
[52:26] conscience gets seared and he can no
[52:28] longer feel that when the Lord comes to
[52:31] him to prick him there he can no longer
[52:33] sense it when when the Holy Spirit comes
[52:36] and say oh that's wrong his conscious is
[52:38] here that you can't feel it anymore you
[52:40] can't sense the boys spirit boys spirits
[52:42] trying to enter in to tell you what
[52:45] you're doing wrong but because you have
[52:47] ignored the Holy Spirit for so long and
[52:49] all of a sudden your conscience has been
[52:51] seared as a hot iron Nelson you cannot

[53:23] unto the Lord asking him that maybe for
[53:26] a chance that he just might forgive you

[56:54] chapter 62 a male I read about Beulah

[57:03] that's not a time I don't hear it that I
[57:05] don't enjoy
[57:07] Beulah long I'm longing for you
[57:12] amen Isaiah 62 okay man we want to do
[57:21] those things that are pleasing to the
[57:22] side
[57:34] Isaiah 62 verse 4
[57:45] it says thou shalt no more be termed
[57:52] forsaken neither shall thy land be
[57:56] anymore
[57:57] term desolate but thou shalt be called
[58:00] Hepzibah and I'll ambulance in thee and
[58:05] thy land shall be married
[58:08] amen they meant verse five there says
[58:11] for as a young man marries a virgin
[58:13] socialize sons marry thee and as the
[58:16] bridegroom rejoices over the bride so
[58:19] shall thy God rejoice over the hue aging
[58:22] God rejoicing over you as this thing
[58:25] become real to you a man and you realize
[58:27] that the same God that created the
[58:29] heavens and the earth the same God that
[58:31] we have gathered in this room to be in
[58:33] his presence this morning that same God
[58:35] has desire to rejoice over you as a man
[58:38] does his bride amen what can what place
[58:42] that we're in where are we standing this
[58:44] morning where are we at this morning
[58:46] that the God of heaven would tell us
[58:49] that I desire to rejoice over you like a
[58:52] man would rejoice over his bride I
[58:55] desire for a Joy's over you that much
[58:59] Amen I was looking at that word forsaken
[59:02] he says I will not call you forsaken any
[59:04] more I was looking at that word forsaken
[59:06] and I was looking at the dictionary you
[59:08] on the dictionary they got things that
[59:10] are called antonyms and they have things
[59:14] are called synonyms let me give you a
[59:16] little English lesson this morning and
[59:20] we homeschool our kids let me let me
[59:22] give you a little English lesson this
[59:23] morning an antonym is the opposite of
[59:27] any word so you take the meaning of this
[59:30] word and there's another word that is
[59:33] opposite of the word that has opposite
[59:35] meanings and there's another word
[59:37] there's another type of words called sin
[59:39] on him a synonym is an English word that
[59:42] is these there's two words there are a
[59:45] lot like each other and that the means
[59:48] of the one are complementary to the
[59:51] meanings of the other so if you took a
[59:53] sentence that has this word in it and
[59:55] you take this synonym over here and take
[59:58] that word out and put this
[59:59] word in it would mean basically the same
[1:00:02] thing but just give another little
[1:00:04] flavor to it
[1:00:05] they give another little vanilla so you
[1:00:07] can get a three-dimensional aspect of
[1:00:09] what it looks like so I was looking at
[1:00:11] the antonyms and the synonyms of these
[1:00:13] words here so the word forsaken they're
[1:00:17] the synonyms of or the the synonyms the
[1:00:20] similar words to forsaken are left
[1:00:23] behind departed from abandoned neglected
[1:00:29] not cared for not considered not heeded
[1:00:33] not even used you're neglected you're
[1:00:36] forsaken you're not used but God said
[1:00:39] you will no longer be called neglected
[1:00:41] you will no longer be called forsaken
[1:00:44] you will be used you're you're going to
[1:00:46] be considered you're going to be cared
[1:00:48] for you're not going to be called
[1:00:49] departed from you're not gonna be called
[1:00:52] abandoned you're not going to be called
[1:00:54] left behind you're how he likes that
[1:00:57] this morning we're looking for a rapture
[1:00:59] right now you're not gonna be left
[1:01:00] behind you're not going to be forsaken
[1:01:02] this is not what you're looking for and
[1:01:04] he says neither is your land gonna be
[1:01:06] called desolate nor desolate the
[1:01:09] synonyms for desolate are devastated
[1:01:11] there's nothing left together everything
[1:01:14] is blown apart things you see pieces you
[1:01:17] see things that are supposed to be
[1:01:19] together
[1:01:20] blown to pieces it's desolate it's it's
[1:01:23] not was supposed to be like is there's
[1:01:26] no life there it's been it's been taken
[1:01:29] apart life has been destroyed he says
[1:01:31] your land won't be called that you're
[1:01:33] away at land what we called the desolate
[1:01:35] land your lane won't be called the
[1:01:38] devastated land your land won't be

[1:01:49] have desired to look upon you like a man

[1:12:07] has called us has anybody ever been
[1:12:09] called this morning a man what did he
[1:12:11] call you unto you he called you unto his
[1:12:13] eternal glory is that off in the future
[1:12:16] no that's right now Christ has a glory
[1:12:19] we've been called to enter into that
[1:12:21] glory too but the God of all Grace who
[1:12:23] had mercy and grace plants who has
[1:12:25] called us from before the foundation of
[1:12:27] the world has called us unto his eternal
[1:12:29] glory by Christ Jesus
[1:12:30] after the Eve suffered four little eyes
[1:12:33] who made it who here has suffered a
[1:12:34] little while amen amen
[1:12:37] he's gonna what he's gonna make you
[1:12:39] perfect amen that were we going through
[1:12:41] all his sufferings for he's making us
[1:12:43] perfect Saints a maze raisins up into a
[1:12:45] statue of a perfect man he's raised us
[1:12:47] from glory and the glory into glory he's
[1:12:50] gonna what's he doing he's establishing
[1:12:52] us
[1:12:52] I mean who here can say that you are
[1:12:54] more established now than you used to be
[1:12:56] a man who here has a greater faith now
[1:12:59] than you used to a man who has greater
[1:13:02] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:13:04] used to have a man what's he doing he's
[1:13:06] strengthening you and what happens when
[1:13:08] your faith gets greater you begin to get
[1:13:11] stronger
[1:13:11] hey man you take the sword and you can
[1:13:14] cut deeper a man you can push harder
[1:13:17] you can push back the devil harder and
[1:13:19] what it was to do it settles you a man
[1:13:22] when you get settled what happens you
[1:13:24] can go and you there is no fear there is
[1:13:27] no you're there think of a soldier going
[1:13:31] down to through the streets to through
[1:13:33] the arm he think of a one-man invasion
[1:13:37] think of a one-man old invasion a
[1:13:40] soldier of the Cross he has he's like
[1:13:43] Moses going down to Egypt he knows where
[1:13:46] he stands he knows what he has he's been
[1:13:48] strengthened he
[1:13:50] been settled his faith he knows that the
[1:13:52] glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is behind
[1:13:54] him he knows that the all the power of
[1:13:57] heavens behind what he does a man why
[1:13:59] why because the God of all grace has
[1:14:02] called him to that a man now there's a
[1:14:04] companion verse to that let's go over to
[1:14:05] the second Peter verse 11 1 verse 11
[1:14:11] you know how because it goes there 1st
[1:14:14] Peter 5 it goes through all the virtues
[1:14:16] add your faith virtue knowledge
[1:14:18] temperance temperance patience godliness
[1:14:21] both of the kindness and all these
[1:14:23] things he says for if you do these
[1:14:25] things you know you shall never fall he
[1:14:28] says but if these things in about me and
[1:14:31] you and abound in you they make you they
[1:14:33] shouldn't they either be barren nor
[1:14:34] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:14:37] Jesus Christ think about this man he's
[1:14:39] standing there with a sword he's got his
[1:14:41] faith
[1:14:42] he's been strengthened he's been settled
[1:14:44] he's going about here my lord send me
[1:14:48] not whoa is me but send me and then he
[1:14:50] keeps going down he says uh-uh he gets
[1:14:53] down he says in verse 11 it says for so
[1:14:57] an entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:15:00] an entrance
[1:15:02] what are we entering into think about
[1:15:05] this soldier now he's ready he's been
[1:15:09] strengthened
[1:15:10] he's been settled he has a sword in his
[1:15:13] hand all the sins are under the blood
[1:15:16] his faith is now way the way up here is
[1:15:20] not just his faith he has the
[1:15:22] supernatural faith now whereas it's not
[1:15:24] a faith that's being given by man or
[1:15:26] been creating his own mind but he's got
[1:15:28] that supernatural faith he's standing
[1:15:31] there he's got the virtues he's growing
[1:15:33] up into Christ the verse shoes are being
[1:15:35] added to 1 upon glory upon glory upon
[1:15:38] glory

[1:15:40] higher and all sudden he looks up and
