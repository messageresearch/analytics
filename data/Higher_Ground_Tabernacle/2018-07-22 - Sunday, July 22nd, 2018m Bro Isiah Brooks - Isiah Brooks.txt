man hey man praise the Lord we thank God for His grace and God's goodness as we stand we'll get right into the Word of God our brother Frank will be interpreting for our brother my recent family we've got to get some machines here if someone remind me to order something we'll do that so that we'll be able to interpret like we do down in Iowa City for those who are not well in speaking English turn to psalms 150 Sano's 150 and from one Psalm 150 we'll go to Matthew 18 I figured I'd get your blood stimulated a little bit Amen by God's grace I don't know what it is or what it was saying like I had a hard time waking up this morning but I made it somebody else told me that too they had a hard time I don't know it was really good asked them off for a good sleep and he gave me one yeah yeah you don't have to speak interpret as loud as you need to so that they can hear okay praise ye the Lord praise God in His sanctuary praise Him in the firmament of his power praising for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the psaltery and harp praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with the string instruments and organ praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals that everything that had been done Matthew 15 fifteen we thank God for our new carpet right God has a way matthew 15:8 through nine this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men one more scripture st. John for we're going to try to take our time this morning because we we have few visitors and friends we want by God's grace for them to understand what is being said this morning st. John 4 beginning at the 21st verse then Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth let us pray our Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves forgive us Lord of everything you forgive us for every thought and desire that have not been pleasing in thy sight cleanse us Lord and wash us this morning from all darkness Lord look and search even as the psalmist said it there thought you find anything in me that shouldn't be take it out of us Lord because we realize Lord Jesus that we are predestinated to the adoption of sons and daughters and Lord we're pressing our way we're moving forward so that your word would be made manifest in us grant it here this morning each and every heart in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated so don't worry about disturbing anyone rather just so they can hear all right I wanted to minister this morning on the thought the only way to worship the only way to worship there's only one way to worship we have many facets of worshiping we're in that you have a lot of organizations denominations and and even those who are centered around what we call the message first of all what is worshiping what is praise as we read in Psalms 150 everybody and everything can praise God but not everything in everybody can worship God worship has been defined and narrowed down to one thing when Jesus was talking to the woman at the well most of us know the story she had five husbands and the one that she was with was not her own and as I said amen last week the world looked at us in a different way than which God looks at us when that woman came to the well the world may have looked upon her as being a prostitute but when Jesus saw her she was a daughter of Zion and the conversation went on and she said this woman said to Jesus don't you know that it's not lawful it's not right for you to ask me for drink because we have a segregation between the Jews and the Samaritans and according to their law you're not to even have a word with me and then Jesus said woman go get me a drink and you know how the word the story goes but then Jesus comes and she he begins to discern her thoughts and her intent and then jesus said to her woman if you drink of this water in which I'm going to give you you'll never thirst again see that that that's what gets me that God is the true thirst quencher and we realised by God's grace they went on to say talk they talked about worship and the Samaritan woman was talking about how they worship and they worship in these mountains and whatever the case may be but then Jesus said unto her basically your worship is in vain you don't even know what you're worshiping but the Jews they know they have a true revelation of who they are worshiping and then Jesus said one day all of this will be done away with it won't be that you're worshiping a mountain a worship in Jerusalem a worship in DesMoines there is coming a time that the worship place will be changed and they that worship Me must worship me in spirit and in truth when we think about worship we think about paying respect to God a sacred personage it's it means more to me and you who that then just praise anybody could say thank you Jesus but you see that could be just a praise but worship comes from a deep place in the heart it is a gratitude that only that individual experience and everybody can't worship when we think about how Israel was set up and how they had the outer Court they had the inter court and they had what we call the Holies of Holies we have a picture out there in the vestibule of how Israel camped around the Ark of the Covenant you see you can praise God and worship Him a praise God on the outer court but the outer court had no sheltering place if it rained you got wet if the Sun was shining us you got Heat and that's how Christians are they still in the outer Court they out there where that they they are swayed by the weather if it's cold outside they're cold if it's raining outside they're saying if it's sunshine they might be happy but it was the atmosphere that change their way of praise now in the inner court you had the seven golden candlesticks which represented the seven messengers of the seven ages but even so those candlesticks had a way of going out waxing loofa that's why in Matthew 25 Jesus says trim your lamps get all of the wax get all of the things in your life that's good in you or hindering your life for shining from shining move it out of the way trim it because in that holy place you heard me a sanctified place a holy place hallelujah those candlesticks could still go out and when the candle speak goes out Peter said at that time you have forgotten that you've been purged you have been you have forgotten that God has sanctified you and you have forgotten and you can't even see your way that's what happens to Christians when they're still in the inner court it's a good place to be but you have another place that you must enter into and we call that the Holies of Holies hallelujah and the property I said we need to not only enter into that holy place but we need to shut the veil close that veil amen and never come out again that is the bedroom of God if I could say it like that those who enter into that Holies of Holies they are able to worship God in spirit and in truth see but you say well what Brotherhood's I got truth but you still can't worship God according to his perfect plan until you get spirit but you say brother once I got spirit but I don't have truth you're still not a true worshipper is that right he said the true worshipers will worship me in spirit and in truth you're not a true worshiper until you enter into the veil Alleluia you should all brother Brijesh worship is adoring Jesus but you got to realize hey man a lot of people can praise Him and praise is a form of worship but it's not the intense worship it is not the worship that God wants to bring us into you see that's why Amen our our so-called worship can become ritualistic it can become follow and when it becomes formal that means you have an incident to the veil because once you enter into the veil it's no longer you worshipping but it's God in you worshipping when you get to the place and you don't want to come to church you're not in that veil like you ought to be when it feels when you feel like you you just don't want to pray you're not in that veil hallelujah when you're not reading your Bible you're not you haven't gone beyond the veil hallelujah amen behind that veil we're talking about the Shekinah glory of God but we're just not talking about a baptism of the Holy Ghost we're talking about being completely filled amen in secured sealed up hallelujah amen where the devil can him get in a crack the Bible said that was the problem with Israel they had they were able to praise him but they didn't have their heart they didn't have the heartfelt religion it wasn't they hadn't gone in not they hadn't they hadn't really they weren't really serving God you know it outwardly they were serving him and inwardly they were void is that right it's true Jesus told it those Pharisees he says it was good that I come because outwardly you look like white it's up like are you you give you beautiful outside but inside your dead men's bones you see what I'm saying now true worship you got people everywhere that really believe that they're worshipping God and the Bible said they're worshiping in vain there are in reality a many Christians who thought they were heaven bound and when they die instead of us sending they descended he said I oh brother what are you saying let's take for an example the rich yellow Rula whom Jesus invited to come with him and when Jesus invited that rich young ruler he literally were asking him to to come and preach be a minister preach for me but the rich young ruler and then he had so much wealth and he had a real a machinery of the business going on and he thought no I can't give up everything you want me to give up everything and follow you remember Jesus had nothing the Bible says foxes have holes birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay as him so here was a man dressed in a par garment he wasn't dressed like the rich folks of that day and he's looking at this wealthy wealthy wealthy rich young ruler and say come follow me no doubt in his eyes he was looking at the physical shape of Jesus and looking at the wealth that he had and the fine clothes in which he wore and thought within himself how can I give up all of this I've spent my whole life so uh so I could come to this place where I won't need anything and he turned from the Lord Jesus and said this is too hard for me to do I can't give up everything I've worked so hard for to follow you and then Jesus flipped to another page and the rich young ruler is now wealthy he's old he's ready to retire and he says to himself a man see he thought you know he thought he was a worshipper because he asked Jesus he said listen when he was young he said what must I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus says sell all that you have and follow me and Jesus questioned him he says listen I've done all I've kept the commandments I rest on the Sabbath pot I've done all of these sacrifices that I need to do I've been done everything but one thing he did not do he did not give God his heart he worship he did it practically formerly instructively but he still didn't have God in his heart he was legalistic he was starchy he was formal and he did not have God in his heart and so when God not on his own the door of his heart his heart could not respond yes because God was not in his heart now he's an old man and he's got all of this wealth and he's saying to his soul oh my soul you've done well in business you've done good in the stock market now look at you you got all of this riches and now it's time for you to retire but he had no idea that God had a card saying this day is the last day for the rich young ruler to live hallelujah and God allowed death to come and pull that car and when this man died hallelujah instead of going to heaven he went to hell listen and the thing about it people said when you're dead you're done no sir when you leave this place you are not done you're not in some comatose how lujah but you are in a place that's just as real if not more real than this place and that rich young ruler a man looked and all of a sudden he saw someone that he knew on earth y'all know the story when Lazarus a men were begging a warning bread from him stable Lazarus was a Christian hallelujah and you know how rich people are sometime when you a Christian they feel like you wasting your life hallelujah but Nazareth wasn't concerned about his life on earth he was concerned about the life he was going to go to you understand me this life here is temporal young people this life is temporal elders this life is temple the little of us that this life is temporal you're not going to stay here forever one day you're going to die hallelujah don't be concerned about the riches here be concerned about the riches bad the bible says set your affection on things above hallelujah not on this earth because this is going to perish and everything in it and that right Oh hallelujah see it doesn't matter who you are what you are if you are gene seed of God is that right God who will quicken 18 so a true worshiper must worship God in spirit and in truth and in spirit it's the Holy Ghost right you know I must understand by God's grace that God in the days of Noah sent nor nor was the doorway for you turn a life is that right he was the doorway and everybody that didn't listen to Noah no matter how foolish it sound they perish even if had their only boats even if they had their own organization in the nomination look Noah was the voice of that age yeah I understand me and so we go on you said what do you mean no one could have said except you hear this preaching you go to parish with everything else is that right just like Moses Moses was the voice of God you had Pharaoh you had the Egyptians you had all kinds of idol worshippers in each other but Moses was the one man that knew God Moses meant God on the backside of the desert Moses met God in the place that we're in that God stepped out of the bush and into Moses and then Moses walked down to Egypt a man with a rod in his hand saying I have come to conquer Egypt and foolish as it sounds hallelujah it is the truth that one man all the through the greatest nation on earth because at that time because his leadership because of his worship hallelujah and you see you can't worship God the way you want to when God when Moses met God the first thing God told Moses take up your shoe the ground that you're standing on is holy ground you understand me so God will instruct you on how to worship you can't worship God by offering him things that pertains to Buddha uh Allah you understand me it must be pure it must be clean and it must be simple let no man according Ephesians 5 and I'm coming back to that thought let no man deceive you with vain words but because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience be naughty therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of the light for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth so you what are you saying brother Brooks you know the fruit of the Spirit is all righteousness and goodness I remember I said it's the Word of God said you can't be two kinds of trees at one time you can't be like the serpent was good and evil you got to be either good or you got to be evil hallelujah you know you can't be oh I'm almost no you're not almost there is no in-between there is no purgatory hallelujah if there were a purgatory this is it hallelujah because when you leave here you either going up or you going down is that right now hi I'm going to get in here you said I said this the other day and I said all the time because I'm sorry I'm gonna look fast for you I'm sorry I said all the time you were born into this world before you came into this world you lived in your mother's world right that world got too small for you and you are predestinated to enter in business to this world now this is not the end of it you have another world we call it heaven and this well amen nothing but the righteous nothing but the Holy nothing but the clean all that pertains to God is there hallelujah and the only way that's what Jesus said be holy for my father which is in heaven is holy you a Lord how can I get holy gee there's no holy mountain there's no holy water there is no holy man the only way that thing that makes you holy if there is a holy God on the mountain if there's a holy God in the man if there is whole a holy God in the water then the water is holy he said why absolutely this god of mine this god of yours is axel he's able to even make the dark holy is that right he said to Moses this ground you standing on is holy ground Oh glory to God y'all don't have to say Amen but I'm telling you you and I must understand amen knowing this message is good knowing that God sent a prophet is good but that won't get you into heaven hallelujah many of those in that day who knew Moses was sent as a prophet perished in the wilderness hallelujah because they failed to worship God in spirit and in truth hallelujah knowing that God sent Jesus Christ means nothing the devil believed that Jesus is the Son of God hallelujah and there is no redemption for him hallelujah oh just to say I take Jesus as my savior it's not good enough there's a time justification was suitable hallelujah and God's accepted that during the time of Luther remember God moved on up to sanctification hallelujah and Wesley came that was acceptable is that right amen now just being sanctified wasn't enough hallelujah and I justified wasn't enough death not not being sanctified is enough you got to be born again somebody help me is that right Oh people so all if you just you know God is love and if you just just take God you know you can just do what you want to do go where you want to go act like you want to go do as long as you just confess the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart you shall be safe that's the beginning it don't it doesn't stop there that is the beginning right and look even though whoo-hooo rebelled against the true in which Moses brought was lost what you mean to tell me that they overcame the death angel by putting blood on the doorpost and the little escape the Death Angel they marched through the Red Sea baptized unto Moses millions baptized unto Moses hallelujah yummy yes and then when they got out into the wilderness they thought they'd do their own thing oh did they shout hallelujah Mirian got that tambourine and they began to play and they had a glorious time hallelujah but the same ones who had the blood on the doorpost in a little the same ones that were baptized a minute of the Red Sea the same ones that women shouted on the red sea shore died spiritually in the wilderness I this Christian walk is a journey y'all hit me it's like a baby being born that Christian must mature into a grown man he must become a word Christian a Christian that believes every word is that Alright you know when the Lord sent melikhaya for here you didn't send him just to to tickle our ears and just to stimulate our brains that's powerful that's wonderful oh that's deep I'm sure they said the same thing to Moses Oh Moses where did this man come from that's deep Oh Moses I love coming Oh whether those fowls come from that's deep that didn't say them Paul said you can understand every mystery and have not the love of God in your it profits you nothing you just can't love your friends and your neighbors you've got to love your enemy hallelujah you got to love those that despitefully use you you got to love those that crushes you you got to love those that hate you and you know they hate you you got to love them anyway oh I don't like them you have no space to not like them you got to love them you may not love their ways but you must love those individuals if you don't you won't get to heaven he said what do you mean brother go stop them I'm off my notes Jesus says that no no the disciple says Lord teach us how to pray our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and god quicken that to me the other day let thy kingdom come has his kingdom come his kingdom has come his kingdom is the Holy Ghost hallelujah is that right peace and joy and righteousness in the Holy Ghost his kingdom is come so when that Holy Ghost come it must cause you to live like you are in heaven not in Hell in heaven come on somebody that Holy Ghost it's supposed to cause you to live like you in heaven thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven hallelujah and if your Holy Ghost is not causing you to live like you in heaven you must check up somebody is that okay that's the real Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will cause you desire to desire heavenly things you must have a love for the truth is that right you must have a love for the truth you can't worship God if you don't love the truth remember they asked Jesus Pilate did are you a king and Jesus said don't say it and once you just called me a king you asked it in the place - but in your mind and you are your spirit you know I'm a king and jesus answered for this purpose came I into this world but my for this purpose I have a purpose you've got a purpose hallelujah we just didn't come here we have a purpose jesus said for this purpose I came into this world and he goes on his head my kingdom whoo it's not of this world my kingdom our kingdom our Father is not of this world and it goes on to say oh pardon said but don't you know I can I can I can deliver you I can free you I can kill you whatever and then Jesus said you can't do nothing and everything that you're doing is what my father has allowed you to do now I'm coming to some things in just a minute I'm taking my time you and I are not just creatures of time we are creatures of eternity that that I was somewhere before I got here is that right and you were somewhere before you got here sometimes we experience these things what we call deja vu and deja vu really is a manifestation of you where you've traveled somewhere in your dream because you know every time you dream you travel that shows that you just not all body your spirit too and you come to some places you said oh seem like this place is so for me I've been here before it's because in your dreams because the Bible said God orders man by the way of his dreams God draws it out place it in your dream it's like it's like uploading a computer he puts it in you and you you follow that dream don't even know why you're doing what you're doing but God has already uploaded you now you said well what do you mean brother Brooks listen whenever you see a DejaVu I love those things I loved it when I happened cuz sometimes I can tell you what's getting ready to happen now that's not every time a time okay I know this is getting really hot you know but you don't tell people there cuz they thank you crazy but at the same time it makes me feel good because I know I'm in the will of God when those things happen amen listen because God have from the beginning chosen you and I that we hear that often time but you'll never know what I'm talking about until you get the Holy Ghost until you get a real call in your life you'll never know what predestination is you'll never understand how God chose you I just really don't understand that why other than I was a part of him that's all I know and I realized by God's grace that God placed me in such an evil age and my duty in this evil age is to preach righteousness holiness is that right it's you know to preach amen the message of the our word God is already delivered unto us that's my duty I'm just a man blowing the trumpet or resounding what has already been said that all right why because I'm living in a time where there is a mystery of iniquity now Paul talks about that mystery of iniquity and said that his work is it's working in it going to always work what is it it's the devil's religion Satan has has copycatted or he is mimicking Christianity is that right even the message he's got people that can jump and shout at every divine revelation but they can't live it that's not spirit and truth you got to live this thing it ain't in your head it's supposed to be in your heart is that right it ain't about knowing all the mysteries the greatest mystery that you ought to know is Christ in you when you know that he's bad amen like a stone nobody can move you hallelujah you understand me when the Holy Ghost is in you you can worship God you don't have to worry about how high you jump hallelujah because you've already reached heaven and you can jump as high as you want to right you and I must realize that we're not playing games with the devil Satan is the wickedest thing that could ever exist and he has an agenda and he's got you on his agenda he will offer you pleasure I heard brother do Co on Friday night down in Iowa City I thought what he said was so wonderfully profound he said when God allowed the serpent to deceive the serpent worked with her hearing she meant us we allow ourselves to be deceived by what we see our eyes become our greatest enemy especially when it become when it comes to a woman but when it comes to a woman she wants to hear those good sweet things she won't her husband to say all those nice things to make her feel good he how no it's true hallelujah but a man don't need all that he just loved what he see is that right and that's the way it is now a lot of preachers will seduce the church by the way they say things is that right but you got to realize that we didn't come to just speak sweet things we came to preach that that kind of a message that will cause people to repent people who to be convicted about their sins we don't preach a word Amen that's gonna cause some people to look at me inside of them and see that they need help we all need help is that right I can't say this enough thank you what we where are we we're at a time that Satan can give you a strong delusion a Bible the Bible calling 2nd Thessalonians said because they did not have a love for the truth is that right oh I'm just gonna wear what I want to I'm gonna do what I wanna do I'm gonna go where I want to go I don't care what the message said this is the way I feel this is what I want to do I don't care what they were I'm gonna go where I want to go I'm gonna do what I want to do I'm gonna look at what I want to look at that right I don't care what brother Brooks preaches Alleluia one thing for sure this man has no desire to control you I don't have a controlling bone in my body and if I could control you what good will it do you because at the end of the day you'll still be lost you understand me this is an individual of faith even though we come together as a church it's still an individual affair is that right you've got to know Jesus Christ for yourself hallelujah so let me move on there is only one spirit and that spirit is God and the Spirit of God is what the spirit of truth you didn't you didn't evolve you didn't come here on a spaceship you know what I mean you understand me you came by way of generations right you came by way of Adam and Eve and Adam and Eve came by way of God when you said let there be is that right so you and I must know that whatsoever we do whatsoever we ask in the name of Jesus Christ he'll do it you said I don't have the Holy Ghost if you want the Holy Ghost God to give you the Holy Ghost but you got to surrender everything right is that that that's simple I'm trying to be simple when a woman gets married and she she's got that veil on her head what's she saying to that man I'm rendering I'm submitting when we came to Christ he bailed us right with his Holy Spirit and you and I are saying Lord Jesus you are the head of my life somebody said well you know she's the neck and you the head and she can just turn you wherever you want to go but some things about that neck and I don't mean to be funny that neck can get stiff that neck can experience pain you ever heard experience pain in the neck so you understand ain't nothing glorious about the neck your neck Kate thing it's their head that thinks right so you and I must understand whenever the neck gets involved and leaves the head out of it then what happens that head began to look in places he shouldn't look because the neck is turning it right so you and I must understand by God's grace amen that when you unite with one another amen you are uniting in a way amen that she is in her place and he is in her place I don't care what the world is saying God has a Laura and whenever the woman moves out of her place her marriage becomes perverted and whenever the man moves out of his place the marriage becomes perverted hello spirit and truth you know how they tell they say no ain't no man gonna tell me what to do well if you want to get to heaven now I ain't talking about a man who's abusive in town telling his wife to do crazy stuff I'm talking about a love relationship hello that's the way a marriage is supposed to be it's supposed to be a love relationship where the woman wilfully gives and the man willfully gives and he supplies the needs hallelujah that's truth you say well what do you mean that is the relationship that God between Jesus Christ in His Church it's a love relationship she stays faithful to him he stays faithful to her is that right listen let me hurry up let me hurry up I'm taking too much time amen coming from the message to see Jesus you said I am so happy tonight that Jesus has not forsaken the people in this great day that we're living under this great strain that we are under today yet our Lord has not left us I will not leave you comfortless I will pray the father and he would give you another comforter which is the Holy Spirit and he will abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth who the world cannot receive I am very thankful that the Spirit of Truth was to be with us to the end this and that Spirit of Truth is one other but the Lord Jesus Christ you know why it's so important to have the Holy Spirit because a preacher or anyone can get up before you and can say anything and it can sound so close so right hallelujah and without the Holy Ghost you will not be able to discern whether it's wrong right I have seen people shout and dance in the spirit of words that were erroneous but the Holy Ghost even if you don't know all of this Bible all you've got to do is hear somebody preach something wrong and the Holy Ghost will check you something's wrong here right see the only way to worship God is spirit and truth you said well let me come I'm gonna come to my point in just a moment so see we're thankful that the Spirit of God is with us today is that right amen and you know he said a little while the world won't see me but you will see me how many of us have a relationship with God that we see him hello do you see God do you see him see it all depends on what you're looking at I see God in you I see God in me I see God every day I see God when I wake up in the morning why I didn't wake myself he woke me many people wish they would wake up and they still did not they'll never wake up again not into this realm I see God when he blesses me when I pray and he answers prayer I know that's God hallelujah it's no coincidence it's not something that just happened hallelujah oh oh oh the world said well that's just coincidence it's no coincidence that wasn't just by chance like I told you all the other day I said when I saw that ego down there at the park it flew by me like that and looked at my face when I've been down there just not long ago and I'm walking and Here Come another eagle a young eagle that's it's not fully developed away it he does the same thing he fires right by me closely and then he looks at me Who am I I don't know I'm not trying to be nobody but somehow there's something to that and I don't understand it yet but anyway the eagle looks at me and then flies back up to the nest maybe because I always said they were mine I don't know but one thing I do know with it whether I have a sign or anything I know I'm a son of God now what are the chances that's what the devil say you know that's just chance you know that's just coincident that that ego did that I'm saying uh-uh no no no there's no coincidence somebody told that ego to do what he did that was Anna normal behavior of those two Eagles is that Alright now you said all brother Brooks yeah that's just coincidence well what happens when you pray and you have a need and all of a sudden somebody knocks on your door and give you what you need is that a coincidence hmmm spirit and in truth how can you worship God if you don't see his acts is that what the Bible says I read it 150 I'm gonna praise him in his acts I must see him act I must see him do hallelujah amen in every leadership every moment of my life and may God leaves me and he ought to lead you you you need to see God I see him in the wind I see him in the way I see him in the atmosphere I see him everywhere what happens when you almost get in a wreck now I'm off my thought but when you see that Satan is trying to kill you and God stops him do you raise your hand and praise and worship oh you just say Oh Lord thank you you need to stop pull on the side of the road and give praise I've seen it happen I was in Florida and and and there was a wreck and evident in this lady had the Holy Ghost or something a man she was on the side of the road oh thank I mean loud thank you Jesus I know people thought she was crazy I was just saying lord thank you I got the worship in myself cuz I saw the accident she was thinking God she was alive amen to worship God in spirit and in truth your will must die hello like I said I'm going slow your Wilma's died what gets in the way y'all know it your will and your Wilma's died you said well what about Jesus Jesus had a will when he was getting ready to go to Calvary he said father I would that this cup pass from me I don't want to die I don't want to suffer my friends do not want to go through this but nevertheless not my will but thine be done hallelujah God is not some spoiled brat he's not some spoiled child no sir God will not put up with that nonsense God wants somebody Amen that's going to say yes Lord in reverence God want some added a Hummer themselves not to what you think it ought to be but way it's supposed to be hallelujah prick so many Christians saying oh when I become a Christian oh praise God is gonna be easy know Jesus said you cannot even follow me take up your cross and follow me take up your cross that's God's will take up your cross take up your suffering because people think Christians are insane they think you're outdated they think it's all mystical they think Amen you're gonna live you don't have no fun fun is that what you call fun climbing up on a mountain getting on a parachute and jumping off that's fun hallelujah you call fun amen amen scaling a mountain Amen with a rope that's a deathtrap you know we do crazy things and we call it fun oh I love the adrenaline don't you know the adrenaline one day is gonna kill you if God is not protecting you the devil is just trapping you alright so you say the truth the truth is you said what do you mean brother Brooks the devil said to Jesus catch yourself down from this mountain you know and when devil tell you to do something you know there's on some excitement in it some fun it's true it's gonna be a little bit of fun so oh no but you don't understand it it is written if you catch yourself down Amen the angels gonna bear you up see the devil to take the same scripture I've seen it happen I haven't seen the person but when I was in South Carolina Amen this man they had put it all on the news because the Bible says if your eye of Flint fin you pluck it out in this man pluck this eye out that wasn't the Holy Ghost that's not even what the Holy Ghost is speaking of he's speaking about people in the church amen that's going to be disorderly people in the church that's not gonna live a holy and righteous life that's causing problem in the truck pluck it out I don't care mr. preacher pluck it out I don't care then Deacon pluck it out I don't care if the ELSA pluck it out get rid of it I don't care be your right arm get rid of it why it's better to enter into the kingdom main you said well what do you mean brother books let me say it like this you don't see no fancy car here it would be nice to have one we don't have no great musicians it would be nice to have some hallelujah but that's not what makes us live we live off the bread we live off the Word of God we live off of truth is that okay listen let me let me I'm trying to hurry folks now Mike my thought is you know how Jesus the Holy Spirit how do you know the true Holy Ghost the true Holy Ghost the Bible said is the spirit of prophecy Jesus Christ is the true spirit of prophecy amen that it that's in the book of Revelation 19 so prophecy is is that thing that is foretelling or predicting of something to take place they have never been another leader in our day that has been so great I mean come on Jesus Christ Himself told us exactly what we're gonna live what kind of day we were gonna live in has he missed it hallelujah then the then God sent Malachi for probably God for our our day and he began to tell us exactly the way it was going to be he told us what the church was going to be like he told us I mean the way people were going to be he told us amen how that only a few be that say that right he told us that the way would be so narrow it would be like the day of Enoch when one man would be safe we look at Nora Noah and Noah had it was 888 that saved and just think if it was eight million that means one out of a million made that made that made salvation and now we've got all these churches all over the world amen call themselves Christians and evil is on the rampant right I mean we look at these things and now you said what Brotherhood's worth much money you can't do it you can't live life you can't live righteous you can't you cannot live holy you can not do it but I have a solution to the problem you must be born again people your religion ain't gonna do it and knowing everything the Prophet said and everything else it ain't gonna save you until that which was said it's living in you it must live in you is this okay I'm about to cut it short I mean not sure I won't go long enough but I'm pleading this morning I'm pleading with everybody young and oh and a lot of time you know we just don't pay the attention to the word like we ought to because you know we just think we've got it made you do not have it made until you cross the line of that veil until you go into the Shekinah glory you said what I want to be saved then I believe that any one of us who have named the name of Jesus Christ in this place is saved but salvation just having salvation won't get you in the rapture yet right the foolish virgins had salvation that's what made them virgins but the only thing that's going to give you a true rapture experience is the Holy Ghost being sealed with the Holy Ghost and I had that in mind my thoughts even as Peter said add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance you and I and this must must mature in the into the full statue of Christ people are not preaching it here people you know think that they so deep into everything but they're not concerned about the souls of men and I'm concerned about our souls because you see how you are reflection let's put it this way you are a reflection and wherever your soul is wherever your spirit is you are reflecting that if it's locked up in prison somewhere if locked up by habits and in all kinds of damnable things you are reflecting that if you are in heaven or heavenly places that the scripture we are now setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus if you are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you are reflecting that you are a reflector of where you are is that right oh you take a drug at it you don't know what his name but he's got a demon of drugs on it right and if he's doing drugs guess what he is reflecting his body is reflecting his movements is reflecting his actions are reflecting amen what he is you know he doesn't have to say a word to you an alcoholic when he is it's full of that demon and then he he's reflecting it you don't have to say are you an alcoholic ah that demon you're gonna not only see it you're gonna smell him right and that's the way it is with the Christian he doesn't have to open his mouth what is in here will reflect if it's heaven in him you're gonna feel the atmosphere you're gonna know the atmosphere you're gonna know that he's different from somebody else amen who claim to be a Christian hallelujah come on somebody but you look at a person a man you can't command God Oh Lord I want the Holy Ghost now you don't get the Holy Ghost now you don't accept God he accepts you and you ought to be grateful enough that he's calling you you don't get frustrated with the Oh see that's the way it is with women when they get when they're having a baby you know they get frustrated I want to have this baby now though you got two more months three more months but you gonna have it you feel the life you know he's in there he's kicking you every now and again don't you worry your birthday is coming if there is a thirst in your heart for God God said if a man hunger and thirst for righteousness he shall be filled hallelujah there is no no one will ever get before God says well Lord you didn't tell me or you didn't show me Lord you'll never be able to blame your condition on God because God has done everything the greatest thing that the Lord has given you a since his son or himself Jesus Christ God sent the prophet in this day that brought us a word that separates us from all the organizations and denominations and we're still not satisfied with it hallelujah is that right some of us we can sit among and sit down and watch a movie for three to four hours and never complain just reach over get your pop or get over your soda or your popcorn and just keep moving moving moving moving but when it comes to the Church of God listen some of us won't even get up to go to the restroom but when it comes to God we're running in and out of that running in and out of here out of here like it's nothing it shows that you have not crossed over it shows that your you are reflecting see because I tell you what if Jesus was here which is if you could really see him I wonder how many of us would get bored with him huh because if you get bored with him now you'll be bored with him there that proves if you don't change if something in your heart don't change you will not be there you love the Lord i'ma finish this message this evening because I think it's vital I think I think knowing I didn't say a lot of things because I realized one thing for certain if you don't let the Holy Ghost occupy you your heart your spirit if you don't let God come in guess what you are a vessel you are a house all right think about it when a man dies what comes in worms something's gonna occupy some something's gonna eat you away all right and so my point is if you don't get the Holy Ghost you're gonna get the unholy Ghost the Holy Ghost comes in one person right and that's Jesus Christ himself but the devil he comes in the spirit of lust lust of the eye lust of the flesh and the pride of life and those three demons have so many other demons with them do you know that the devil don't travel by himself he comes in a game as Legion he'll tell you about it see you must understand that if you if you turn from Christ you're going to get worse and what we're trying to do by the grace of God is to make this thing a reality having here knowledge of this thing is not going to take you over you must be born again not only born again but you've got to mature God is coming the Lord Jesus Christ is coming for a mature bride a person who's got virtue faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and divine love will crown you that's what makes a rapture now understand me it can't be oh and you said what brother Brooks I I need you know how could I say you won't true and you won't spirit because you won't spirit in truth that's the only way to worship God and it's not by practicing it a cow don't practice to give milk a dog don't practice the bark you a dog don't practice the bar a chicken doesn't practiced it lay eggs it comes with the C whatever it is is what it is and when you are a Christian and you are truly born again you don't have to practice to love somebody you don't practice to like somebody you full along you love you everybody see what I'm saying you don't have to practice oh because they did good to me I'm gonna do good to them no I'm gonna do good to them cuz that's what I want to do that's what I'm doing y'all love the Lord let's stand let that will be done if you can keep that in your heart in mind let your will be done in earth as it is in heaven so everything I'm going to do my desire Lord everyday is to do what I know you do a would do in heaven though I live here y'all remember the story that the prophet of God Brabham told told about this in isn't a true story this lady was a Pentecostal lady and she was base cleve Pentecostal I believe a very religious lady and she believe in just listening to her pastor even though truth was given to her she rejected it and at the end of the day she was screaming because she saw where she was heading and she called her pastor uh a deceiver she said and I'm gone to hell because of you you deceive her and they they basically hushed up I may have two stories come mixed in but I'm gonna get to the point I'm not interested in teaching anyone how to live here I'm not preparing you for here I'm not a man that's gonna tell you about all you can make all these millions I'm not interested in that it's your souls it's all right you learn you'll learn how to live here but I'm trying to teach you how to live here so you can live there that's the most important thing young and all are dying but I wanted women when I take my last breath I want to make sure I got my ticket in my hand and I'm going up instead of going down and I believe that with all my heart I I don't I don't Tom tried to confuse the grace of God I know it's not by worked but one thing for certain when you get truly filled with the Holy Ghost your life is no longer works your life is your life that make sense when I wake up in the do what I do that's my life I don't have to practice putting on my pants or practice putting on my shirt it's what I do I know how to do that that's how it becomes the Holy Ghost becomes so indwelling in dwelt in you to all you're doing is what he does that's your goal all right people don't settle for religion I don't care how many years you've been in this message or been around it do not sell them for religion that's not what it's can't calm a godsend Isaac to get him a bride god al easy to get Isaac a bride and that's what we are and a bride must be without spot wrinkle or blemish and only the Holy Ghost can do that let's pray father God we come before you I know I've been long I tried to take my time so that people could hear what's being said Oh Lord how I just would have a love to just express it like I wanted to but I just had to be obedient to your Lord I pray this morning that you would have mercy upon us give us eyes to see help us see the lateness of the hour we're approaching soon and very soon what we call a world war 3 and and father I pray Lord God that you you would let the people know that there's only one xscape you promised in this word Lord God that they there be a fire that will burn the world and baptize it you told us Lord God that they there would be a Great Tribulation and father we're right on the brink of it Lord all signs and post signs are just right right there ready to be manifest but evidently Lord they're still bride that needs to be completely sealed Lord out wherever they may be I pray Lord that you would have mercy on us all bring a revival among us oh god we have all slipped in in two areas that we should not be in and we need your Jesus we need your grades we need your mercy lord help us now father and and and just be God to us Lord I know Lord only those who are elected to be there will be there but I'm trusting and believing with all my heart that I'm one of them Lord bless each and every heart each and every mind here tonight or this morning those who don't understand I pray father you'll give them understanding and those who have heard I pray father God that you will allow them to take this word into their hearts and praying for a hundredfold be merciful to us now forgive us Lord forgive those who carried spirits of resentment and things of that nature have mercy upon us father we need you so bad right now I know father you will remember us because you said you will never forget us help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen the more that our surrender the lighter Malou the more darkens the more you take control the more that I can humble myself the more you live me up in everyday lives Lord I love you move for the morning I surrender the light through my loop the more that I release my guests the more you take control Oh Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no but the Frank come give us a song freeze and then we'll be dismissed you love the Lord anybody design prayer can we sing amazing grace means in grace oh sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost by a horse blind but now why see rules grazed I thought my heart to fear and grace my fears we [Music]
