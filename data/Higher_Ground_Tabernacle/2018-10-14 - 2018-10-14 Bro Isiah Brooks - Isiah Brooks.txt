gets ready to come him and sing the song [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey if you ever heard a song like that song at a football game they got it from the church we suck we supposed to do it yeah they stole it from the church but I didn't know that until I came into the church evening yeah we used to say how team is so awful in it but you know God is good too is a the Lord allowed us to do such foolish yes thank the Lord we're going to be coming from Psalms the 93rd chapter of verse that division nah Psalms a nine then Psalms 91 I know the Lord just led me to these Scripture it's amazing talking about I want to say we talk about the Thunder that shakes the devil you know everybody talked about thunders yeah but there is a thunder that shakes the devil and you and I must understand Amen that as I was saying last week God is not through with us yet and we're moving forward in God and I'm happy to know that there's something changing in me every day and that that's something is Jesus and saying we've got our brother Gabrielle with us he fellowship there in Iowa City and he's from Cedar wrap it up amen he has some personal issues that he needs to attend to but we don't want to dismiss service without praying for him he has some special requests and we're not gonna speak what they are but I just know that God will answer prayer amen Psalms 93 and five it says that testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thy house o Lord forever Psalms 911 911 91911 reads he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadows of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust let's go back to Psalms 9 1 1 91 1 and 9 1 1 I figure these are emergency scriptures Psalms 911 Psalms 911 sings praises to the Lord with dwelleth in the Zion declare among the people is doing now think about those two scriptures that are just read both are talking about God's dwelling 991 1 and it's so amazing that God is perfect in his math and how he set things up in the scripture but we think about what God has told us and we see that God in his and his element is perfect he's in all above all through all and there's no way of getting around him he's so high you can't get over him he's so low you can't get under him he's so wide you can't get around it and we realize they've been today that that song was perfect to brother so we think God for His grace as we have been talking about your subject stop matter started the life we now live and I said and studied and we talked about it this morning the most precious gift that God can give is his life amazing that he does it in a natural and he gives it in the spirit of spiritual he died that we might have his life and now he's given us his life what amazing amazing grace let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for your love divine and without you Jesus we are nothing father we pray that your perfect will be done we are needed people and father we living in the last days where Satan is distracting so many of us and father is difficult not to be distracted without you so may we abide in the shadows of your wing help us father God that will dwell in that secret place on high in that anointing that we call the Shekinah glory let us be there lord have mercy upon us Lord as we come before you as humbly as we know how thank you for your presence in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated discussed and talked about it we realized they men that one thing that as I said earlier when David was saying thy loving-kindness it's better than life and we ourselves those of us who have experienced God in some manner we know that that is true the Bible even tells us that is the love of God that bring men unto repentance now God can spank you and God can do whatever he wants to do but when you see the love of God for you and it causes you to repent that's even more wonderful we showed you by God's grace that if you need something done in God the only way we can achieve that is to have faith in God and faith in his word because God is its word and you and I know that one thing for certain Christianity can it could be mimicked by science you know we we talked about that this morning or preached on it where we talked about how that Christian science can produce or all of the attributes of the spirits you know love and patience and kindness and all of those things brother mantle said they can do it and brother Bellamy goes along and he tells us now we talk about attributes in character he said the high priest and all really in in respect look better than Jesus did he said they were the ones who were kissing the babies and they were the ones at the funeral and they were the ones who fared the poor and needy and things of that nature and here was Jesus with a will amen he said now where was loving-kindness there he said with a whip driving them away from the temple screaming my house should be called a house of prayer it should no longer be a thin of Thieves so when it comes to character I want you to understand by God's grace and we've said there's so many times it's in the seed it is something you cannot produce of your own it has to be in the seed in which God from the foundation of the world but if the seed is ripen if it's lit if it's quickened this seed will break forth of his kind sometime preachers feel and I know this is so true there times that preachers preach one thing and live another and this is why I tried my best by God's grace to live what I preach am i perfect and those things no but that's where the grace of God comes in the Bible tells us that the brother Bram tells us that preachers called to preach and to live it too so it doesn't matter you know you look at a man of God you want to see God's character in him not that you're trying to put him on a magnum flying glass or some kind of telescope examining every part of him but you want to see by God's grace the kind of character the Bible declared that he would have flowing out of you one thing I know about Christ is that he never ever put himself above his disciples he never told them to call him Reverend he never told them to call him Bishop but his name was Jesus he always dwelt among the common people he was so common today felt comfortable talking around him whether it was good or bad they literally talked and discuss things around him knowing he had discernment things that they should not have been discussing and the world corrected them every time one thing about brother Branham I was told that brother Brandon was able to make the least of all at least a min feel like the greatest and so when you're talking to people with Christ in you it's not you puffing yourself up but you humbling yourself and making them feel great then Jesus do it he said Peter except you washed my feet you have no part of me and Peter did not want Jesus to wash his feet but Jesus being God humbled himself y'all hear me I'm talking about the Holy Spirit this is kind of like the Holy Spirit makes you live it doesn't make you want to be one of the great ones it makes you want to be the least hello and when it comes to a preacher a preacher supposed to be in a place where he becomes the least not the greatest hello but his switch is turned around because of nickel Antonin ISM now the preacher becomes king he becomes God that's not Christ that's not the life he lived Jesus was so common it took Judas to identify him with the kiss he didn't wear a special raiment to say I'm there I'm the leader that this group of people you know what I'm saying but he kept in such a way that nobody knew who he was until he was identified by healing he was so common when he told the people amen don't tell nobody what happened here but you know how we are and gotta tell us not to do something we way out there come see the man right now when we talk about this and that's what brother Graham said he said if you can't live it and stop preaching a preacher is coming to a place and I'm not just going to dwell with the preacher cuz I'm coming to you we are the living epistles of God written and read of all men and Jesus bravano said the reason why we are the Pinkney epistles because he said it all to read like this because it is written we are now being read because it has already been written now we are being read and understanding man Mary was written but one day she was read she was a very inversion that the Word of God says she would be Mary didn't know she was that virgin until the angel came to her you didn't even know that you was a son and God of God truly until his angel came to you he was able to identify you in the scripture and somehow we have a problem with it but we I've identified in the scriptures that right you shall bring it to me bring it to me here was ELISA coming down it says Lord the woman a man that give not only the camera water but give my man to drink let it be her and here was Rebekah coming out and guess what she identified she identified herself and brother man said God was working on both ends so God works on both ends you're not supposed to god says oh you the length of God but you don't know it I have chosen you to do this but you don't know it God inspired Rebekah what to do even though she didn't know fully what she was doing he inspired her and then to feed the camels and the men that was her identification because she denied it with the thought of God Abraham was the only I mean Ella here ELISA was the only one that knew the thought of Abraham right she didn't dare she wasn't there when Eliezer cried out Lord I don't know how to choose a bride Amen but you know how to do it let it be thus and God inspire Eloisa amen to lay out the criterias of a wife and in Eleazar look Lord and God inspired Rebekah to do what he required and then Eleazar didn't say well I'm a I'm a man now I'm you know how I haven't found the right no he humbled himself Oh God you have been faithful in your promises when it comes to the Word of God but the bottom said it like this he says no matter how educated you are how much culture you are able to accumulate you you yet you've got to yet face death and because it is written that means must die and that the judgment death is not so bad but coming to the judgement is the bad part now you can die but happened that the judgment and God is not going to inquire of you how much schooling you got when you were on earth and how much knowledge you accumulate it whether you've got a Bachelor of Art or whatever degree of my hair even as a minister he's not going to be required of you but is going to be required of you what you did about the understanding of God's Word that's where the requirement comes because that see your education is fine but the Word of God is life my world is life and to know it is life and he said know him he is the word so you can only know him by the word for he is the word that's the only way you'll know him is by the word see so why that's why we're so important in this day if we're gonna live the word we must have the word we couldn't we you've heard me say this before that's why we were not attracted to Oral Roberts or Billy Graham or Tommy Hicks or any of those those because we were not of that seed and I want to clarify that because I think people misunderstood me one time when I said that see brother Branham didn't have a seed the seed that he sold was God's seed right so when I talk about seeds I'm not talking about amen a man seed I'm talking about God seed right and so we when we talk about uh-uh-uh these men sowing seeds I mean that's why we we weren't able to catch what they were doing we may have seen it we may have admired it but nothing made us attract it like a magnet but when it came to this message and we heard it it attracted us like a magnet hallelujah it caught ahold of us we didn't catch ahold of it it snatched us to it all right and because of that it has identified to us who we really are Oh doesn't make any difference right now and have vowed you might think yourself to be that's not what God is looking at he's looking at the seed that's laying on the inside of you because he know the seed in itself is perfect and it will not come back boy it will accomplish every seed listen whether we see it or not there are trees that are deign to bring forth fruit and there are trees who may be of the same kind of fruit that will never bear you say that in Scripture it is because Jesus came one day to a fig tree and found that fig tree without fruits hello basically it was impersonating a real fruit tree you and I must understand that voices is something I love the way brother Branham pushed this he says thousands of live forces he says all we need in jeffersonville but let me say all we need in the MU and I all we need in Iowa City thousands of little voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish is there anything too hard for God see what we must understand this scripture is referring to people who have been quickened seas that are living not potential right the foolish version had potential but they needed the line to come alive in them but the only way that the life is going to ever live you must die and rot that is the order of nature in order for seed to reproduce yourself it must die and rot right a man you should all brother was what are you saying but you must also understand the gospel to us did not come in word only but through the power manifestation of the Holy Ghost and in all in other words it is the Holy Ghost taking the Word of God and making it manifest they can never you'll never receive the Holy Ghost I get it if you don't believe it's for you you got to believe that's mine when you approach God you're approachable a bonus Lord you said if I repent like I read this morning and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins of my sins you said I would receive the Holy Ghost and Lord you said I now can come boldly before the throne of grace boldly when somebody has promised you something and said they gonna give it to you you don't come up timidly you come up boldly with an assurance that they have promised they gonna give it to you it's there they've got it and that's what God wants he wants you to approach him in faith because you said it I believe it now I want to receive it I come to receive what you told me I was going to happen that's what every attribute every attribute if God says I'm supposed to have godliness I'm gonna approach him with it you said Lord that godliness was mine that you have that for me is that right and brother Ram said listen he said all the potential everything that we need to make a rapture is already in us how many y'all believe that I believe that everything I need to make this rapture is already in me you know what the problem is I got to move out of the way that's what it is Lord I've got to move I've got to surrender hallelujah right understand to live godly is painful huh that's the scripture you will suffer pain sin in itself gonna cause pain spiritual pain you ever been thirsty and couldn't get the water it's a different kind of pain something happens is different kind of painted it can literally cause you to get anxious sometimes I anxiety comes I gotta have water don't give me no kool-aid I won't water it's something about it when you thirst for that you know well nothing else ask a thirsty man in the desert a man he's thirsty been out there for a long time and he wants something to drink and you ask him you won't Pepsi a water promised you he gonna tell you water because God water is God's divine quench the thirst quencher right and that's what he was telling even in the spiritual that's why Jesus I'm the Living Waters I'm the dwell springing up into eternal life I'm it you can't he said listen if you receive this you will never thirst again you won't want nothing else I will this she that's why you don't we y'all know that's the truth we cannot I don't know some people may still be listening to radios and stuff you know gospel stuff and I'm not saying you can't get a little tidbit you might get a little something but normally Amen you don't want to hear that like that because it just sounds like noise to you is it static ecstatic is something going on there you can't feed you can't satisfy you what you're looking for that's why I play the tapes I better be careful how I say to epical yeah they might think I'm moving into another dimension here nothing here here here yes but I also listen to preaching is that right so you what are you saying brother Brooks so you understand that this life that we're in what's the use of having a fountain like I think once we stop with the water outside out here and you go up there and you try to push it and nothing comes out because it was empty you would disappoint it weren't you ah because you had a thirst you had something on the inside that was calling for the water and it wasn't there that was a good that was a good thing that God did he gave us his plenty water and you know what we were doing wasting it and then God took it away from us and then what now you want it see that's you did away yes it wasn't there to play in it wasn't there to amuse the children it was there only for third to be a thirst quencher but see that's how it is with the word if you don't thirst for word the Bible said if you thirst not only would God fill you but he's he even like it for bread if you hunger for it you shall be fed you shall be filled is that right she the word is God and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the world was God and then Jesus said ye abide in me and my word and you ask what you will it'll be done for you now how many I'll believe that I believe it he'll even even even Joe he you know when he we start going through the test the faith the thing that Joe was examining himself is like Lord have I not kept all your precepts havenõt been faithful in everything that I know of it got to the place that almost sound like Joe was glorifying himself on the matter but Joe knew that there was no sin that he knew he had done so he couldn't understand the trials and the tests and everything that he was going through and many times that's how it is when sin or when sickness or anything come my way I said Lord what have I done I don't say Lord what my neighbor did what have I done what did i do am i the breach and I'm the reason for the sickness and if I am revealing to me that I may make it right you understand what I'm saying so you and I must understand you know what is more important to have tongues and interpretation they have prophecy prophesied or to be an example of what God speaks of being divine love you can love you enemy brother branham's real Christian weed gets to a place that you can team up set in now I'm not there yet I'm not like a firecracker I don't easily start burning and exploding but there are times and I asked God I says God you talk about undisturbed faith that's what I want I wanted so wonderful and so in me it meant that nothing can disturb it because worry is not an attribute where it comes from the fall is that okay she staying with Christ in the word she don't go right or left take right with it and then it's actually not your word then is his word understand me the Word of God cannot come back boy I wanna I wanna be with the Thunder that shake the moment on the Thunder that shakes I was sitting on a Thunder wherever I be my life Thunder that is speech y'all know what thundering is right you can't help but to notice it and often time you hear the Thunder before you see the lightning right but I just don't want to be all thunder and no lightning because the Lightning is to display of the power of the Thunder hallelujah and so you look at this thing he's all brother what are you trying to say I'm trying to say wherever I go make let me beat let my life be a difference not what I say what I live hallelujah see when we we're not careful even in this message we find ourselves just like the world with programs and entertainments it got so placed I remember when we came and we had somebody lead in prayer everybody would pray but now we just listened to one man's voice we become accustomed to it and I don't know whether people are praying in their hearts are praying in the mind's eye what they're doing but the prayer is not to entertain you the prayer is here for God it's a direct connection to God but we're listening and I don't that's why I don't like praying in public because I have to fight with this idea of praying when I'm praying to God I can just say the way I want to and not worry about anybody judging my words and I struggle with that because the devil say you know you gonna mess it up on your English I mean he does whatever he can do but my point is is that when the prayer comes out in the morning or the evening and then we all ought to pray he just leading it's like a song leader he's leading the songs but you're singing with him prayer is supposed to be the same way he's praying but you're praying with him come on somebody so y'all get quiet on me but that's the way it's supposed to be now when it comes to perfection all of us are guilty of not being perfected with ourselves brother balanced and obedient to the great commandment given here by spirit Paul st. Paul excuse me let us just remember this that we are guilty that some way and somehow the best of us are guilty before God because it is written of the Lord Jesus Christ be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect so we can only be perfect through our faith in his shed blood hello he didn't say works our faith in his shed blood but there's not one thing we could do to help ourselves we have to trust in his mercy let your light so shine mmm because what we do we get we get a little if we're not careful such a thin line between law and grace and why are you doing what you're doing like I said this morning Amen people said well that's the way my church believed it wrong wrong answer when it comes to God you're a shame of God now your shame to a at you believe that and that's the way I believe it and that's the way I am convicted to believe it it ain't the church it's the word hello so we can only be perfect through our faith in his shed blood but there's not one thing we could do to help ourselves we have to trust in His mercy so I will pray for you that God will forgive you for all your unworthiness and you will you pray for me that God will forgive me for my all my unworthiness hallelujah now brother Branham is talking about this because and this message she's working with so let your light shine amen is a communion service they're bout to have communion and now we're facing the table we're facing communion and we must acknowledge that all of us have been guilty one way as a brother says or another you pray for me and I pray for you hallelujah is that Alright because even when God gives you the Holy Ghost until we have change but let him said it like that in this book this flesh ain't gonna be no different until God gives you your other body you have to fight with this until Jesus come oh but you see what it is when you become a perfect man guess what happened you no longer a child a child child faith a child got a little strength a grown man got far more strength right so we grow in strength we grow in faith we grow till after while we put the devil to shame it doesn't mean that the devil gonna stop coming and messing with your mind but he when he comes a man we're so fortified it's like trying to get beyond a fire hallelujah we're so far defied til he cannot get to us because we've grown in Christ she you the devil cannot work with darkness unless you have darkness in you hello you said that ain't true James says it you're drawn away with your own lust and enticed so it ain't God that you drop it's the devil somewhere has a seat in you and same thing pulls on that but once that devil is gone there's no place he can look there's no place he can pull you're the problem not God it ain't the Lord you've got to overcome all the inhabitants of the land is that right brother well listen he told Joshua when you go into that land I want you to slay I want you to kill everything they told told the man of God if you do not kill them they will become a thorn in your flesh and that's why Israel still are dealing with the Philistines the same people God told them to kill they didn't do it and now has become a thorn in their flesh and as that was in the natural so it is with the spiritual y'all hear me you and I must understand by God's grace it is his loving kindness that makes us love him more when he does kindness to us when we don't even deserve it David said his mercy endures forever his mercy amen is renewed every morning I love that you know it can't be exhaustible it's inexhaustible it is there enough amen to that like like like like the Prophet God said it's like a little rat a little mouse in the in the in the in the oh there in Egypt in the in the storage place where they store everything says you know I better be careful because I don't want to eat it all up a little mouse in the granary with all that grain he could never eat it all up he said that's how it is with God why do we want to spare God he made God wants to give you the greater things he wants to see you perfect he to see these attributes manifested he loves a rainbow he loves it seeing it reflected through you and around you and above your world it is his covenant he first made and guess what that rainbow was not possible until they had gone through the flood you came in a year ago just drop in your lap you must suffer the Bible said those who have suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin you gotta suffer because your flesh couldn't want to do want you to do the contrary things but when you can put that in there harnessing the Holy Ghost and when that devil hey one of them right I think I told you about this story this is a reality when I first time riding a horse I went to ride this horse and this was a smart horse for somehow that horts knew it was my first time on a horse was back and so the horse wanted to take charge he did and when we would go down this the the inclines he would gallop in a certain way that would make it would be right even so I caught on to him I started talking to him like it was a man I said if you do that again i'ma pull this ring and imma imma break your neck at least it make you feel like it huh you know that that old horse tried it again I pull out that rock I like I want you to know I'm the man that horse straight know I'll never forget it I let him know I'm the boss and that's how sometimes you gotta meet the devil no you the boss no he ain't the boss of your life you're the boss now because you did that I'm gonna shout you eat what did you do to beat what did you try I'm gonna show you how much you'll think of me I'm gonna praise God for it see you gotta get that weapon tree of praise and song and let him know I'm still a victory I'm still the Conqueror why he made me so I don't have to work hard thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ brother Adam said it like this in a message the unwelcome Christ he said Jesus reputation is made we're sinners is Jesus reputation is made with sinners it takes sinners that realize they're sinners that realized their loss realize they're always there away from God that would get beside themselves and then worship Him that's where he's his reputation is made you can't give God a reputation without praises without testimonies without telling somebody about his goodness that's where it's made that's why you go through trials so in tests so you can tell people just how good god has been to me that's what it's for you know it's not for you to just keep yourselves and all knowing all the goodness of God and you don't tell nobody the testimony of Jesus is sure and you and I are supposed to tell those testimonies you know a lot of times we don't tell them because the devil says you don't you know all you've been as a hypocrite how you going to tell somebody Amen what God has done from you I don't care how much you think I've been a hypocrite listen people if you to bridle cars you could never be a hypocrite let me say that again if you the Bride of Christ you can never be a hypocrite if you are under the blood you can never be a hypocrite put it that way so that you're alone that when you're under the blood God don't see your sins all he see is the blood but the devil would make us think and calculating this net only to hush us up you can't tell nobody about this message because you ain't been faithful I can't tell it if I'm thankful I'm not faithful it's true anyhow see he try to hush you up and then by using your false and what we call our failures but listen you keep praising God is that right brother BAM said there was known there was no difference between Israel and Moab they served the same God had the same altar the only difference he said that Israel had a covenant they had a Schmitt rock they had a pillar of fire hallelujah they had promises that lawyer didn't have that's what makes us different it is the promises of God it is the promise of a rapture is that right oh when Joseph Amen came and he saw look Benjamin the Bible said he gave all his brothers food and substance but if we came to Benjamin he gave him a great portion hallelujah I'm liking this bride this last little Gentile a piece of what's left I like in her core we weren't around when the great revivals was going I wasn't oh if I was I was just a little top you understand me but now I've grown up and I'm promised a double portion and so are you right I am a special born child just like Benjamin was hello I'm special born so are you and therefore it's all right to say the Lord where are my blessings it's all right amen you say God I won't see I don't care about limousines and great cars and great houses and greatness it I don't lived it enough to know that you can be looking in a great house and still as long as you can be you can you can be driving one of the finest cars there is and still be crying because you feel rejected them alone ha poet of God but what I love if I'm a poor man give me Jesus hallelujah because of our God Jesus that's enough y'all understand we people used to sing that but since they've got enriched Jesus ain't quite enough but let me tell you something he will always be more than enough for me hallelujah because I'm going to tell you something even your best friend can never be there when you read the lead of the most is that right it's okay I can't be with you when you're in your house feeling lonely in blue or going through whatever y'all understand me but one thing about Jesus he's always there that's what I mean and you know what I can't always say the right things that's gonna comfort you but Jesus can say one or two words anything I don't know about you all you gotta say you know I will always love you I become brother in his head it's the truth one word in your countenance from God settles it all stops the devil foolishness is that make sense I was like I told you before I was going through something and and I was in my kitchen and I heard his voice hadn't heard it for a while in the way that he talked he said I I'll never leave you nor forsake you who now you could say what you wanted that scripture brother I know it but that scripture came alive to me in my kitchen the devil say you know you that's just see the devil says you know that's just you but when you hear it at a time you wasn't thinking it you know it came from somewhere when you hearing and you wasn't even thinking that it comes in a place where you weren't even thinking about him and he comes in it he interrupts everything changes the atmosphere that's God oh my goodness I'm trying to explain an experience and I don't know whether you're getting it or not but my point is when it comes to people in this message they they say they know him but they hadn't heard him talking a long time he speaks he talks hallelujah amen he will enter into your heart and your mind and say things that your heart and your mind could not even cut think about thinking I'm saying I know what I'm talking about hallelujah as I said and how we're going to be much but I said this the greatest gift that God could give you his life and why aren't we enjoying it your life's supposed to be enjoyed hallelujah listen if you just got a slice of bread you ought to thank God for the slice Wow because some people don't even have a slice how are you Oh Lord I ain't got number one pair shoe some people don't have shoes come on y'all that's the truth I used to get an attitude what I want to go buy a burger and then have money to buy one what a spoiled child right when god I got food and refrigerated everything else and I rally my pot keep looking through my thing I'm a Burger King or some kind of that's what I used to eat that stuff you should come to my mind and I didn't have no money to drive through the drive-through but I get an attitude like God you know humma never have a seat I know it's our foolish people I'm telling you the way the devil used to fight me now I got more than enough I've been asking the Lord showed me who where to give these suits and things away I just got too much stuff and you know what it's gonna always be that way you know because the more you give the more you get it's true I can give something away and here comes something else right and there are times I have bought gifts from people and here comes somebody else giving me the gift that I gave to somebody maybe even a better one so you look at these things and you say what brother was what it is it's just the law of God good measures press down running over and if your life is not going going that way you need to examine it and see why it's not going that way I do you love the Lord oh I've given you situations and showing you a man that see it you can't work with this with the intelligent intellectual faith and you know before I never knew that there was intellectual faith until I came to this message if this message is trying to you know you believe Lord I can believe I know it's true well you know what it was we see the difference between Israel and David because here was Israel with an intellectual faith they knew what God they knew Jehovah but they had never seen him live and here was David outside there in the field with the Sheep and he saw God killed a bear he saw God killed a lion so he had more than an intellectual faith he had a faith by way of experience he had a revelation that the God they were serving he served was greater than this Goliath and killed you have a true experience with God you're gonna always think that the devil is greater you may not ever say it but your actions will prove that you really believe that the devil has more power over you than God and until you really have an experience and really believe God Satan will always reign but when you haven't experienced with God it overthrows Satan it kicks him off the throne of your heart and the Jesus come to reign there is that right that's what I love about that story when when when when David wanted Jerusalem and and you know the I can't even think of the name of it right now those are those who had Jerusalem jebby sites and the Japanese dykes were were really descenders kind of like of the Giants they kind of had a connection there and whether you believe it or not it was those Giants those debuts that literally made those people who was lame and blind and David said I want you to kill all of that that despises me this is my city and none of that has come gonna enter into my city I want all of that swept away you know what I'm saying every true King gets rid of everything he doesn't like right and David says listen I want to get rid of all of that find me a man and Here Come Joab huh huh amen Joab me L it exam exhausts Jehovah but let me tell you something iover son of Jehovah let me say it like this it meant by God's grace here was a man who didn't even know he would be the one that would but would help this establish Jerusalem y'all understand me and and what happened is he goes in there and he literally kills all that was needed to be killed so that ednan and he and he gets a reward from David understand there's a Joab now that's in favor of God's plan for the New Jerusalem that's why no lame you know what the lame is a man who can't stand straight on the word you understand me a blind man everybody know that he can't even see it cuz he ain't born again hallelujah you cannot even see the kingdom until you're born again and you and I must understand that that must those kind of people must be done away with and that's what's happening around the message if you remain blind if you remain lame it's a spirit that's gonna get rid of you because you're not going to enter into the New Jerusalem like that and that's why Jesus said he said you know if your eye offend you pluck it out hmm anything that's going to all to you and cause you not to really believe the Word of God the way it is get rid of it you got to stand for testing times right now all right you want to see the devil afraid of you live it live God's Word you live it in the devil of sick in the shoes hallelujah right let him oversleep don't let him get up because when he did love is gonna be troubling my kingdom let him sleep that's just the way it is and you and I must understand that if you if you go search that out in the scripture where that Japanese light would you rusyn woman they had a valley that was literally symbolic of hell and understand even even even where David and Goliath worth fighting it that was a it was in the valley and so I want you to understand by God's grace that that even David knew that Goliath had descendants you and I we don't understand but listen every time brother Berlin talks about giants in this day he calls them intellectual and when when when he was about ready to depart from from Jeffersonville he said Jeffersonville the Philistines is among the intellectuals those whose going to alter this thing and turn it and change it if you don't fight because you know what happened y'all and if you follow they followed it well they the things that God wants the things that God would do among them that once excited that them became common you hit on the tape brother boundary buchen them because they these things have become common he saw them growing cold he saw the far leaving he saw the changes that were going to take place down there you know what he said he said whatever you do don't pattern yourself whatever but whatever bred them Tabernacle does don't you pattern in yourself behind it I just pretty much raised it that way myself but that's what he meant he saw the changes taking place and you think he didn't see what was going on now you follow that if you want to that proves you don't have the Holy Ghost brother Brooks you're gonna say yes I'm little saying there's only one message for this hour Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 has already happened there is nothing else to follow other than the bride in her revival and right now she is being revived and what caused brother Branham described to us what revival is are not shouting and dancing is getting over to dine out of your life and if you are getting trashed out of your life you are in a revival people are so afraid and when did Jefferson's view become our Mecca this is God absolutely this is brother Brandon's quote book and he didn't preach nothing but Jesus is that right that's what he's at Paul said I increasing nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified now I didn't die for you don't be baptizing in my name I did nothing for you and the Prophet Guard had to come back and say the same thing why because the same anointing that was old Paul was on him because both of them were prophets one was the Alpha and the other was the Omega you and I must understand that the word of life has been given to us and it's more dangerous for us than it is for the denomination cuz they don't know no better but for us the Bible said to whom much is given much is required and let me tell you something I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna say it again there was no way that we can live this without the Holy Ghost and does it does he make it easy for you no why you say that because he told brother Brennan he said this thing this great portion of heaven is given to you because you have chosen the harder way he gives you a choice you can go the hard way or you can go the easier way you understand me he didn't call us rainbow trials for nothing we got to go up the stream he loved the law heard I ah he's still working on me but I you know I don't get discouraged like it's not gonna be completed because he said he had completed the work he started in me I might go through some trials and tests and you know right now I was telling somebody I said right now I did the truth of the matter is I'm going through a great flood but then you know the Lord quicken to me while I was preaching it was a rainbow that came after the flood what a powerful covenant amen what an assurance that God gives us it was a rainbow that came oh yeah I don't see what I'm seeing maybe I don't know but he just oh my god yeah God is realistic we still got communion I get carried away yeah we're gonna ask our brother to come up now and we're gonna pray for him brother come Gabrielle hi I love this brother he he's got a lot of
