========================================
life here is great with friends I love so dear Comfort I get from God's Own word yet when I face the chilling Hand of Death oh where could I go to the Lord oh where could I go CH where could I go yes

soul church I'm needing a friend to help me in the end where where could I go to the [Music] Lord amen where could I go but to the Lord we're glad to have everybody here tonight and we appreciate those who are still coming I uh know the announcement perhaps got out late to some but yeah if we had service on Wednesday they should have known we were going to have service on Friday but as we stand um we ask that you turn with us we're still working with Ezekiel and uh we'll be uh coming out of excuse me I said Ezekiel I meant Jeremiah but we're going to jump a little bit and go to the 18th chapter of Jeremiah but before we get there we want to just uh give a scripture here uh according to habca and it reads habca 2123 I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the towel and I and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am am approved reproved excuse me and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is for is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t uh let's have a word of prayer our gracious father God we thank you for the reading of your word we thank you for being so good to us we thank you Father for just being all and all to us and we realize the more we journey the more we see you and father I thank you for the Amazing Grace that you have given unto us we pray that you bless Lord this uh service tonight bless it in a special way and father we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated if you would turn with me to Jeremiah the 18th chapter uh we're going to read the 17th and the 18th verse there I know we I know we stopped around the uh 13th chapter uh and uh but we haven't forgotten about that but we just kind of want to just uh kind of give a a jump ahead and and perhaps we'll go back but I I wanted to to give you an idea of of the day that we're living in um why I believe that this this uh Jeremiah there's so many things that were happening in the in time of Jeremiah that that coincide with what we are going through uh we went through it earlier some of this where the people were so backsliding they just didn't couldn't hear the word of God and you got to realize we're not dealing with worldly people we're talking about Israel the church the church people were so backwards they were so fallen from God to not even the preachers were serving or the priests were serving God uh and and the thing about it is they thought that they could just live any kind of way and then come to church and God is going to sacrifice mean accept their sacrifice but um like I was saying just the other night worship and praise is two different thing in and everything can praise the Lord the tree can praise the Lord the but everything that have breath praise the Lord you know every animal Birds sings and all of these things but only only those who are called and selected or elected by God comes to a true worship and when when you come to a true worship that means that you have have surrendered unto the almighty God and now he's living in you you and him have become one and uh so but but you know you got to understand that God is a god of love God is a god of compassion but in all of that he still is a god of judgment and fire and I think a lot of times people take his kindness for granted you know I I used to have a sister I mean you know really she said well me and God got an understanding but God doesn't have an understanding other than his word and you got to understand the Bible wasn't put here to put us in bondage or to uh to Shackle us down or the the the word of God is here to protect us it is here to warn us it's here to direct us uh had not we Fallen uh we wouldn't have this written word as it is but because we have fallen God brought this written word so that we can read it understand understand it and know his thoughts about what his his I uh uh uh will is for us uh and and and to know that God controls everything uh but it seemed like Israel used to know that uh they come through uh great trials and temptations and uh you know God delivered them out of Egypt they saw the pill of fire they saw you know just the Angelic beings of God just performing miraculous things for them they saw how God fed them when they didn't have food you know they they saw how God clothed them kept their shoes and everything uh you know but down the road you had other religions other things that's why God say don't don't Worship in the way of the heathens you had Moab you had all of these other tribal people that worship their God and a lot of those those their worship uh you know I'm glad we're adults pretty much but a lot of their worship was sexual sins they offered up themselves they you know they offered up their children their babies and you name it it was just a a a worship of pleasure and that's what Satan is he is a God of Pleasure and anyway I'm saying all of these things to so just to give you a synopsis of what what God was trying to tell is Israel come back to me it's not like we went together and we were engaged but you you're my wife and he says come back to me I will accept you even as as bad as you've been I will accept you but the problem is is real didn't want to be accepted they actually wanted to just continue to do what they wanted to do because serving other gods were far more pleasurable it was a lot more fun it gave them temporary Joy you know and they failed to see that this life is temporal and it comes to an end and God is the only one that can give you everlasting life or eternal life so here in Jeremiah 181 17-18 says I will scatter them as with an East Wind before the enemy I will show them them the back and not the face in the day of their Calamity in other words God saying listen I I tried to call you I tried to woo you I did everything I could but you turn your back on me but basically he said now you're going to call on me one day and that's when I'm going to turn my back you won't see my face but you will see my back then said they come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah now I want you to consider what the message people have done in this last day we have had a prophet and we know the prophet is brother William brandham uh but we have we come to find out that in reality they hated what he taught they tried to cope with it they couldn't cope with it and and in turn they began to speak evil of it right now this is what they did to Jeremiah here they say come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the Prophet come and let us Smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words and that's what we've seen it was such a great Fallen away till they had all other priest they had other prophets they had they had all kinds of stuff uh going on almost like a Corinthian Church but nevertheless Jeremiah was the word for that day and instead of taking hold of the word of Jeremiah they believed that they were Invincible right so what are you saying that's the way message Believers believe we believe that we are invincible and don't don't get me wrong we are those are who are born again and got God in them they are but there are a lot of people believe that because we follow the message see just like Israel said you know I'm a Jew you know this Temple will never be destroyed Solomon said it will always be with us God told Solomon that right but at the same time God can do what he wants to do amen and everything has a time and everything has a season right but at the end of all season God comes out as the winner right somebody was saying something to me the other day and uh you know it says it just seemed like we we always come at at look like a loser I said well Jesus did too I said think about what he had to suffer they call him bebob he died a horrible death he did not die a a death of a a vict a Victor uh he died in sin and shame he was naked he was mocked di uh only on his cross you know it talks about how that he you know said he was the king of the Jews you know what I'm trying to say if you look at him he looked like he was a failure but what they did not understand is that there was another season coming I'm getting a little excited they didn't understand that there was another season coming right he had to die right but there was an appointed time he would be resurrected and though Jesus had died he could not come up from the grave at a at his own timing because the scripture said he had to lay in the ground for three days even as Jonah was in the well right so he couldn't just get up when he wanted to his spirit amen had gone back to God his soul went to hell and preached there and and you said but yet his body was dead and if you can see this it looked like the body of Jesus Christ is dead it's not dead there's a season for the resurrection and it will never happen until that that appointed time that God has appointed and he didn't give us a time but he said no man will know the day nor the hour that time has come he said the season as as the prophet God said we may not know the day nor the hour but we will know the season that's the scripture the Bible said I there's no need for me to teach you of the Season you'll know the season and all I'm trying to say is if if we can look at Jeremiah and see what they missed they missed the season of their judgment they missed the season of escaping they missed the season of God's mercy they missed the season of God's grace and it seems like Jeremiah died a loser but everything Jeremiah prophesied came to pass you see what I'm saying and that's the way they look at brother Brandman look how could he be a prophet he died in a car accident it may look like he died as a loser y'all hear what I'm saying but he died as a winner how do you know that we is on tape the message reach reached home that's that was an important thing that everybody that's ordained to hear this message will hear it because it's on books and tapes and is in the word so I said all of this to say watch the attitude of the people even in this church people don't want believe what brother bam said is true some think it's a fairy tale some think it's his his uh that's his opinion and they fail to see they fall right into the Trap of the enemy and when you resist the word of God in such a way God can't help you cuz he sent you the greatest gift that he could give outside of himself and that's a prophet with the word people don't understand God calling to to the Jewish people calling to him now remember God said because you won't answer I'm going to scatter you did God scatter him absolutely just like he said at an appointed time God scattered him Jesus before he was crucified he warned his disciples the judgment is coming on Israel the judgment is coming on Jerusalem for what they did for crucifying the son of God he told them judgment is coming he said when you see the armies encamped about circling Jerusalem he said flee when you see them coming flee to the mountain hide yourself and those who heard the scripture heard the preaching was able to escape but all of the ones who did not when Titus came he destroyed them he killed them it it's the same thing that Babylon did Babylon tore the walls down burnt the city and everybody that would not humble himself to the king of Babylon died now I'm just telling you we are now living in almost the same kind of situation here and the thing about it is you can preach warning you can preach judgment and and the people can't hear you cuz their minds on something something else there's another voice in the land that's telling the people you all right you going to be okay you don't have to worry about nothing in a way that's true but the Bible also says watch and pray that your father will count you what worthy Amen to escape the wrath that is to come is the Wrath coming is coming amen and now that the Gentiles are uniting together around Israel where's that going to put us we don't know how soon but we know it soon and it behooves us like I was saying the other day Matthew 25 had us inspired to do one thing answer the voice of the call there was a Midnight Cry and 10 virgins woke up they all slumbered and slept five of them were wise and five was foolish the wise amen they made sure they had allil and extra oil what is that they made sure they had the Holy Ghost and the word extra in their vessels amen and the old foolish amen thought church was good enough let me tell you something church is not good enough this church can't save you there's only one Savior and that's the Lord Jesus Christ no church can save you just like they thought in in in Israel they thought oh if we could just hide in the city of Jerusalem amen we'll be safe they were not safe it was a trap because the one who they should have put trust in which was Jesus Christ they missed him and what happened when the enemy came came in like a flood there was no standard they all died babies and all it got so play so bad in Israel to you know especially Jerusalem till they were eating their own children eating their men servants everything God cursed them with it happened let me tell y'all something people are now in our day now don't you ever think they won't they turned calistic overnight I know I I know somebody might even be laughing about this right now but it's no funny matter it's not a laughing matter cuz most of this generation is insane anyhow he said go ahead and and Jeremiah 33 and three turn with there quickly we'll come back Jeremiah 33 and3 you see in all in all of God's judgment he still offers that mercy and Grace but don't you know there's a line once you cross the line there's no more he can only continue he could you know he he Woos you he C he calls you he call but when you constantly turn your back on him that's where're in it everybody just thank God Amen his grace and mercy is with us amen yeah many of us sometime want to quit or walk away or do something that's not quite s but at the same time there's something in our heart makes us know where else we're going to go and who going to Love Me Like Jesus Hallelujah Jeremiah said listen it says call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not think about that you rather love this world and the things of the world like like like Israel did there therefore I example and you're going to let this tie you down people said well brother random said if I knew the Rapture was coming I'll plant my corn anyway plant your corn plant your potatoes but make sure that your heart is in the kingdom and the kingdom is in your heart amen you can do whatever you want to take whatever trip you want to do whatever you want to as long as you know you have met the requir ments that the token has been applied but I feel that a lot of people the token has not yet been applied and the thing about it is we fail to see that everything has a time and a season some of us just don't have the patience to wait on God you have to wait on God and wait for God and that was Israel problem it wasn't that God wasn't blessing them it's that that they their their how could I say said church had became a boore CH church had become common they didn't love God the way they used to the the sacrifices that they they would bring to God a lot of them were were were were mimed and lame it it became a business you know what I'm saying like a lot of the churches have become business and a lot of things have become like a system of worship and God hates all of that you're not the first and where never be we may be the last of this Gentile age to do that but that's what Israel did Israel was such a system when Jesus Christ came they missed him you know why because the system blind them to the truth am and that's what has happened in this message and I have to say it like this it has blinded a lot of people with the truth they believe because I believe the message I'm going to heaven no sir no ma'am the devil believes the message Hallelujah it got to go beyond belief have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe Hallelujah That's Where It's At Hallelujah now you say well what do you mean let me tell you something is we have to learn how to wait the Bible says it how it goes um in our patience possess ye our souls and right now it's calling for a lot of patience cuz we want the move of God Amen we want we want that anointing God promised it to us he going to give it to us we don't have to worry about it he's going to give it to us we can't force his hand we can't make him do it is that right because remember though Moses was chosen to deliver the children of Israel Moses thought because of his teaching his mama taught him that but because of his teaching he thought he can deliver the children of Israel when he wanted to and what happened he ended up killing a man he became a murderer because he was out of season yall understand me that's why it's so important to preach the word in season you know it's like I like like for instance I take the world they preach that Prosperity Gospel find it in the message this ain't about that this is about making Heaven my home amen if God listen Abraham didn't have to do nothing God because of his grace blessed Abraham what did job do nothing but believe God and offered up the sacrifice that's all stay under the blood you stay under the blood God will bless you that's the way it works seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and God will add all of these things to you this ain't a time to be distracted remember Moses born for the work coming from the message spoken word is Original Seed 62 paragraph 373 remember Moses born of the work for the work had to wait on God for an extra gift for the job he had to go back and wait and for the time appointed by God a certain Pharaoh had to be on the throne and the people had to be wanting the bread of life before God would send him back did he say a certain Pharaoh had to be on the throne right and before this thing can fully W wind up am everything must be in position Ahab must be there Jezebel must be there right everything has to be in order can't happen before or soon you know sooner or whatever it's like God has an appointed time now with thousand signs and workers in the last days has created a generation of sign Seekers that knows no more nothing about the true move of God now you say well brother what that got to do with with us with Jeremiah Jeremiah had false prophets among him too amen and they could do signs and wonders they prophesied and they had they captivated all of all of Israel and all of the Elders of that day Jeremiah was trying to tell them you're going to die Israel going to be uh uh uh imprison and Jerusalem and this Temple is going to be destroyed sound familiar Jesus said if you destroy this temple in 3 days I'll raise it up and they thought he was just talking about his body but he knew he knew that Titus was coming down the road and that's what people don't understand God always hid himself implicity but he's still the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if we get off track like they did in Jeremiah's day God's judgment will be the same that's the way it works and I'm reading this because I want you to focus right now and that maybe I'm out of my mind but I believe with all of my heart that our translation our Rapture is not far from here and I don't know why you don't feel it I can't understand why people not feeling the way I feel it but I feel it and one of the things that God has elated me with is that God is Not examining me he's examined My Sacrifice and My Sacrifice is perfect and I'm accepted in the Beloved my airing ways he knew before he saved me Hallelujah there's only one perfect man in and that's Jesus Christ himself but as long as I trust in that sacrifice Hallelujah I know I'll make it that's my that's where I laid my hand I lay my hand on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ but people say well brother Brooks you go ahead on I want to say I want to tell y'all so much so many things but I cannot but I'll tell you I'll tell you like this I'm not against anybody but I have a work to do and my work is to try to get to this church to Jesus Christ to get them to the Holy Ghost yall understand me my that's what I come here to do I don't come here to try to tell you how to do how to do nothing how to be this or how to be that I'm trying to get the people to know how to be the Christian that's what I've been called to do and I will have to give an account for that right I'm just saying because I you know where there's two spirits in the church two of them right and as it said in Matthew 24 two Spirits were close alike to see the very elected if possible and I'm going tell you something let me tell you something if you think that this church is absence of the two Spirits you got it all wrong I don't know what people came here to America for and I don't know why people in America what they thinking about but I'm going tell you something God orchestrates everything and everything is moving by the power of God Amen and I'm going tell you like this you may not believe it but I know who I am I know what I've been called to do and I'm going tell you something there's a lot of people who don't have the voice or ear to hear what's being preach from this pull pit it's like a Jeremiah All Over Again and instead of liking me they hate me just like they hated Jeremiah but I'm going tell you something I'm going to preach the truth as much as possible as much as possible I'm not going to bend I'm not going to Bow and neither will I break because I know I gotta meet him and y'all can y'all can all congregate together and want to jump me and I tell you what I will fear Him still the most how could I tell them give them the word test see now I look at people I says okay did we are the bride we know what the Bible said the love of many shall wax worse the cares of this life Matthew 13 I believe it is the cares of this life would choke why would he put that in there but there were those who fell on good ground and they brought forth aund f F why because they were not distracted by the world Amen what what good would a profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul you know what you know I'mma know when I don't know a a Revival is going on when I see people bringing new people in the door don't tell me oh I'm in Revival and you ain't witnessing when you when Revival is going in on you you got to tell somebody or try to tell somebody whether they come or not you going to tell somebody right and that's that's that's what I'm talking about so let's move on by the grace of God I won't finish that but uh let's let's go back to Jeremiah please let's just touch on a little bit on the 13th chapter I believe it is you love the Lord what what can we say there's so much to be said and you know somebody brought it to my attention you know wanting to evening service on Sunday I'm like I would love that but I don't know whether anybody would come people have gotten so lazy and and and all they think about is you know doing their pleasure but to me I could say it like this the word of God says I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord I enjoy church I enjoy hearing the word I enjoy being in that presence where God Amen be mer where he is merciful to us right now look look what the 13 chapter Jeremiah says thus said the Lord unto me go and get the a linen girl and put it upon the loin and put not in water so I got a a girdle in according to the word of the Lord and I put it on the loins and the word of the Lord came unto me the second time saying take the girdle that thou has got which is upon the loin and arise go to Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the of the rock so I went and hid it by Euphrates and as the Lord commanded me and came to pass after many days that the Lord said unto me arise go to Euphrates and take the girdle from Vin which I commanded thee to hide there I went to the fres and digged and took the girdle from the place where I hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing then the word of the Lord came unto me saying thus said the Lord after this manner will I Mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem so what is he saying it was their pride that caused the condition that they were in and I've been to Jerusalem and I'm going tell you most of the Jews that I ran into or or I put it this way there were some Jews I won't say most that was you could tell the spirit of Pride on them don't do know they that's been one of their issues with all the others you know we're the chosen ones and you're nothing but that's not the way way God intended it to be we're the chosen one but we're here to help you not to step on you you see and I'm all for Israel but take a take the message or what we call the bride of Christ we've done the same thing and that's exactly what the Pharisees and the Sadducees did the same thing it was a low class people we weren't concerned about that's not what the gospel is here here for if we can't show love and concern toward those that are without God don't like that you're full of Pride and God don't like Pride he said this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for for nothing now let me tell you something when God calls you good for nothing you're good for nothing but I'm the I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a Jew I'm Israel you know I'm I'm Judah you know what I mean I'm from jerus you know they who you going to boast to even when Paul was go boasting in Corinthians he said excuse me of my Folly but I'm going to boast a little bit I'm an Israelite I'm from The Tribe of Benjamin and you know how he went through all of that but he can't come to conclude that I but I'm nothing and that's what we must understand until we see ourselves as nothing it's easy to fall into this trap easy to fall and God is like now right now God is still trying to woo us to the Cross he's still trying to get us to see how much he love us and you know what we're so captivated by Pleasure we're caught in a snare and only God can break the snare I heard brother brandom say today in I think it's choosing of a bride or whatever I was reading he said listen he said I might have that on my notes he said the problem is we always trying to do something we always trying to help him you know God don't need your help we always trying to fix it but God don't need you to fix it he don't need you to fix it it's already fixed but the problem is we don't know how to yield we need to learn how to surrender and I mean just get on your knees at some point in time says Lord help me to surrender and you don't stop until God comes you think about the prophet of God how many times he sat in a bush praying for you young lady with mosquitoes all about him for hours waiting on God and how God told him listen you're going to have so many squirrels and how many hours he had to wait out there and when he got tired and thought well this will be enough but God said you said right so you can't even back off of your word when you speak something you got to believe it how you expect God to receive it if you don't even believe it you saying something just right off your lip no it must come from your heart and you must believe it listen he says he says I trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things when we become Christians we totally surrender every bit of your mental power to God and follow after his leading as long as we try to go after our own feelings then we are using the Fallen state of the being because God LED Adam before the fall and after the fall Adam wanted to lead God now God is that right we always trying to tell God what he should do and what he shouldn't do and I think that's the same trap Israel fell into because maybe God wasn't answering their prayers or doing what they God wanted God to do they sought in their own way to do what they want to do and even the scripture say it became so bad to every man was right in his own eyes and that's the way it goes now God provided Adam away but he didn't want that way he wanted to make himself a religion as we say that he wanted to do it himself he wasn't willing to wait on God and say Lord you led me before this see waiting on God with the confidence that God LED you before and now I'm Fallen I'm lost and now help me and show me how to get back to you Lord we have never had all this trouble we got today and if a man would just come that close to God that when you're lost don't try to find your way back just surrender to him and he will lead you back don't try to figure it out that's that's the mental p uh Powers I said some time ago in a meeting I said in the garden of Eden God and the devil chose the their parts of the man the devil took his head and God took his heart the devil tries to show him with his mental power some great something he can do and and he only wants to see with his eyes what he can see Ain that right that's how we base our faith I got to see it no faith is when you don't see it yet you believe amen it's it's the ability to take God at his word you can't see it happening you don't see it materializing but you believe God and the just shall live by faith not by feelings amen I don't feel like God loved me what is that what is that I mean you got job who felt that way job said I cursed the day I was born Nehemiah said I mean Jeremiah said Lord why didn't that man the man who delivered me or or whoever deliver why didn't you just kill me while in my birth that's how hard times were but it doesn't take away your election amen God knew you he knows you that's right it doesn't take away your Christianity because you fail in God but God is saying repent surrender that's what he wants we do not want to be like listen if you don't believe that that bomb is coming something's wrong with you and what other person who ever told us that was the prophet of Elijah he told us our end he told us what was going to happen to this place and whether they will agree with it or not it's going to happen Amen in its season at its appointed time is going to happen my question is how are you going to escape cuz with every Temptation the Bible said God makes a way of Escape and our way of Escape has been given to us through Malachi 4 showing us the way back to the true Jesus Christ who is the word and and the only way you can you can you can follow this correctly you got to die to your own thinking amen see he said listen for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen he just believed it who because God said it he don't have to see nothing or no sense of his body has to declare it he just believe it in his soul where God God lives but the devil took his head make him smart figure out himself out of religion a way of Escape God wants wants to lead him to the path of worship see so I said all of this and I'm I'mma close in just a bit but I want to say this until you truly believe you're saved and TR and truly believe God is in you and I don't mean feeling it because you don't have to feel God all the time but you got to believe he's there and if you believe that he's there he can take you out of every ditch that you're in amen whatever you may be fallen to God can pick you up but you got to trust to God in you he leads and guides you and that's the thing is you know we we we we see Jeremiah and we see what happened to him and to them and I I can almost see God pleading and that's what Jesus did on the cross that's why his arms are wide open he's forever saying come unto me all those who are Laden and heavy lader labor labor and heavy laden come unto me and I will give you rest for your soul right but look what they're doing they're trying to destroy the word they're trying to destroy the Christian they're trying to destroy Israel don't y'all understand and all of this has been ordained by God because they fail to keep the word amen America my country that I love is now suffering licks because I think in 1956 19557 she turned her back on the Living God and judgment is now striking us from every corner and the World At Large hates us why there was a time we didn't have to worry about nobody cuz we had enough God that would protect us but when we decided to kick him out in Revelations 3 put him out of the church he ain't in most of those churches put him out they got the bands they got the choir they got all of the music they got all of the beautiful stuff amen and you better believe it Israel knew how to worship they had all of that all of that but they had everything but but God and that's what you don't want to have everything but God you want to have God and be nothing have nothing if you don't if that what it takes people said wait a minute let me tell y'all something and I'm closing I I just kind of just put everything together because I want you I want to say that's the way it is and every time you engage yourself to a system that system has a way of blinding you to the word you see you gota you got you you know even when I preach I don't tell you not to examine what I preach examine what I preach see if your Holy Ghost Say Amen or it doesn't if I'm preaching something and your Holy Ghost is not saying amen you obligated to talk to me but brother books I don't see it that way why do you see we need to sit down and have a conference or discuss it cuz you need my point is this we need to see what day and time it is amen it's Way Beyond time I think God is just waiting on that last one amen how many more going to come and because you f your church up now am I wrong brother brandham said after the Rapture there'll be a lot of people left behind calling on the name of Jesus thinking that they're being saved he said it they won't even know the Rapture is taking place until the tribulation hits and they're going to say well we thought the tribulation was supposed to the routch supposed to come he said yes and it already passed so we know it ain't the way the denominations is describing this thing that everybody going to see him no that's that's that's the that that's the second Resurrection when he comes everybody going to see him when I say the second Resurrection when he comes on the cloud with the with the saints of God every eye shall see him yeah but but this time is a thief he's a thief and there are many people that are missing right to this day and nobody know where they went nobody knows where they're going thousands of people a day nobody knows in the Rapture be just like that they won't know until the tribulation hits now in closing CU I I'm jumping to the end because there's more to Jeremiah than than the the end of of Jerusalem when they burned him and you know zedekiah you know you'll remember the false prophets and what he did there and he calls a whole nation to be impr prisoned because of his false prophecies Jeremiah was trying to make them aware of what was coming I think a zedekiah I think I've been saying his name wrong he's the one says don't listen to Jeremiah you see it ain't going to happen and he took that yoke of wood off his neck and broke it and then God said tell zedi that they I put a a yoke of iron on his neck now you understand me because of what he did it's going to be worse and and what was happening the people were so rich and busy they wouldn't pay their tithing they wouldn't let the land rest they didn't honor the Sabbath like a lot of people and when you don't honor the Sabbath spiritually that means you don't honor the Holy Ghost you don't have it they didn't honor the Sabbath they didn't let the land rest and other things and because they didn't God said for 70 years you going to be in bondage that was their penalty but God also says I'm going to bring you out you hear what I'm saying now we know by the grace of God that right now we're facing what we know the Captivity of Israel all over the world they in bondage they are in Babylon being ruled by a devil brother vom said one of these old days you're going to find out that it wasn't Jesus Christ who you were worshiping and a lot of these churches they don't understand who they worshiping because the Bible said you got to worship me in spirit and in truth and if you can see the spiritual application of what happened what is happening now the king of Babylon is already got them in such a fix they have no idea what they doing but we the bride of Jesus Christ we know you and I need to go home somebody need to go go listen to the message desperation cuz ain't nobody seem I won't say ain't nobody but there are many people they're not thinking about being desperate or even trying to get there there's some things I wanted to say I didn't say but I'll say it like this God has an appointed time keep crying out before the Lord keep surrendering to the Lord and God will surely answer your prayer yes brother amen amen yes sir it has an anointing on it and at some point in time that same anointing that's on that tape will will come upon you that's why God preached it and the bride of Christ shall come to understand what that's for like somebody says you want to be healed well take this medicine right it's already prepared for you and that's what these messages are medicine gospels amen and they're there to give us health and strength and to revive us and I believe that tape is there to revive us to to put us in that channel because we can't do it on our own you understand me so let's stand remember God said if you call upon me I'll give you things that you can't even imagine I'll give it it'll come by the grace of God but he said he'll give it do you believe that I believe it I believe it right now everybody in here going through some crazy stuff you don't have to tell me I know it financially and everything else it it it is it's hitting in everybody you don't feel like you're left out but one thing for certain we come together to do what to be strengthened by the word the Bible said in the day that day you see the day approaching come together the more amen don't let the devil get you all well I I've been there Wednesday yeah that's the way people thing you know what I mean oh he going to preach the same thing you know so many things people say but just what did Brother brandom say he did that man kept preaching repentance and the one person said why you keep preaching repentance he said I keep pre preaching repentance until they repent he said then when they repent I'll preach something else that's the way the art of God why should I tell you to something new something deep when God can't get us to do what he's telling us to do right off why can't people see that they are the reasons for the seeson you understand me God going to give you what you need not what you want and God has been giving us certain messages I know you say well what are you saying brother I that's why you can't tell me there's not a lot of people in this church that don't need need the we need him amen people that need in this church need to be saved they're not Christians but you you they'll never own up to it and I'm going tell you something you know until we Witnesses I'm a witness if if they should come short I'm a witness I'll be a witness against them Lord I preached it and they oh he didn't God press press press play you know what I'm saying is the truth it's being recorded and that's what people don't understand God in Simplicity trying to get the people es I believe with all my heart and I'm trying to close but I believe with all my heart this church is a gold mind but the goal is no good as long as it has draw in it and God is going to send that fire he going to give that fire and I'm telling you for those who can be saved they're going to go through something they may have I don't know what it is but they going to break cuz I don't believe God gathered these people here for nothing I do not and I believe that there will be a Revival in this assembly if nowhere else I believe that that's what I'm praying for and that's what I'm believing we we and I'm going to finish uh try to try to work Jeremiah just a couple of more more Fridays if you just have the patience with me and and and and we got to see exact I want to get everything out of this that God wants us to hear it is a long book but I want to get everything out of here that God wants us to hear because I don't believe I'm anointed to do this book for nothing and I really appreciate uh uh brother Liz Paul when he preached on Ezra because it it tied right in see these people they didn't change and and don't even think because we're Gentiles we're better matter of fact we were dogs God has changed that and so one more thing you are not a sinner saved by grace you cannot be a sinner and a saint amen and what makes us a saint is not our works but what his words say we are amen you understand me so don't don't as long as you think you are a sinner that's the way you going to behave but you got to elevate your mind to believe I'm a true son and daughter of God and the life life that's in me is changing me from glory to glory you see oh don't give excuses for your flesh because God has made you a new creature and you got to recognize that you are but because of this sometime it's difficult to see but we don't go by sight we don't go by smell taste and Fe we go by the word and all the life in you right now that little pin head of God in you is trying to get you to completely surrender to him that's the victory that is the victory that overcomes that we surrender totally to God and not allow ourselves to become like the people in Jeremiah and Ezra and all of those uh places where they were Malachi just rebellious I do not want to come before God as a rebel you love the Lord let's pray father God we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for this time lord just little bits and pieces out of Jeremiah Lord that we may see all day and see what you are instructing us to do and Lord we're not here to uh bring conflict of interest but we want to be able to keep the people focused on the coming of the Lord that's what we've been called for that's what we we we we're preparing for and and and that's where we want to remain because the hour is so late help us now give us a greater revelation of yourself in us that we may be faithful to you Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen thank you for coming everything
