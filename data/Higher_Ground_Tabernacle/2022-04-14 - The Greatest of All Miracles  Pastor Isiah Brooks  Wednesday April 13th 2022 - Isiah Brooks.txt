[Applause] i'll stay [Applause] in my home [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] love you [Music] as we stand [Music] thank you lord for your grace as we turn our bibles saint john 14. i love john if you see where john is here where john is in his writings you understand revelations in a better way john didn't see him like luke did luke saw him as a physician mark saw him as an ox matthew as a king but john saw him as god and we realize amen that with that influence he would be the proper candidate to for god to inspire to write the book of revelations because in the book of revelation you got to understand that everything that was written there was written about god god's kingdom god's people the extra things that were placed in there dealt with the serpent and what god would do with them but the book of revelations basically was written to give the church of this last day an assurance not only did god in the book of revelation show us our beginning but he also showed us our ending no other age was able to see that the age of wesley no the age of luther no the age of pentecost though but this age which is called the bride age we see we can understand by god's grace what god is doing saint john 14 and 20. let's read the 19th verse yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you let us pray our gracious god we thank you for your presence we thank you for that song and songs that have been song tonight lord i i i get beside myself when i feel you lord because i know uh you do these things and you show up by your own choosing none of us are worthy to even feel your presence but we do thank you father for your blessings tonight and we pray father that you would give us the grace to move completely out of your way that your word will be spoken uh through our lips lord and that the people of god tonight will be able to grasp and to hear and perceive and to take in the word of god so that a hundredfold will be brought forth in these last days may you give us eyes to see and are hard to receive in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated my theme basically is his kingdom is come but i like to work with the subject the greatest of all miracles we have seen throughout the church ages all the things that god have done has done i think that when i look even in the old testament and i see the great miraculous things that god did there by way of of joshua by way of moses and some of the great patriots like you know daniel and david it really used to make me so jealous because especially when i read in the word he's the same yesterday today and forever sometimes we look at those things as being so great and they were and they are but the greatest thing god has ever done he's saved to the last and you and i must recognize what it is it's a great miracle a great thing that god is doing and as a prophet of god say we can see what god did yesterday and we can always look in the future and see what he's doing there but it's very difficult for us to see what he's doing now but when your eyes are opened and you have received the eyes of enlightenment you'll never be the same to know that we have a word that is beyond anything it takes away the struggles one occasion brother branham said that the bride of jesus christ wasn't saved on any day that means that if she was saved she was saved in a time what we call eternity it takes away the wrestling it takes away the fear will i make it if if your names were placed on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world there is no way you could be stricken off the prophet god explained that to us through the word of god that if your name is on the book of life then it's a possibility that your name could be taken off like judas janice and i don't know some of the others but when it comes to the bride or those who have been elected and chosen by god there is no way you couldn't help your birth if you wanted to you may have looked at different nations and you may have seen uh in the indian nation or the european nation or the what you call asian or japanese or whatever you might have wondered warlord why once and i made one of those but god had already said in his mind what you were going to look like we understand by the process that god used he mixed all kinds of things together just to get you so it's not like you are a chance you are a masterpiece even in your natural and uh whether you see yourself as being good i could just recall when god made man in the beginning he said that's very good but the devil is his job to make you think you're nothing he he belittle you throughout the day only to keep you from recognizing who you really are because of every day you recognize who you really are satan is in trouble i love that as i said earlier the greatest miracle is the kingdom of god jesus said amen even when he was talking to herod and pilate and and the rest he said listen if this was my kingdom i would fight for it huh come on somebody you might must understand that god will fight for you we we look for this great uh coming of the lord in such a way that we're missing we're really missing his what he's doing now how you going to make heaven if you don't prepare yourself the foolish virgins were the ones who never prepared themselves but the wise virgin had all an extra oil what was that that was enlightenment that was revelation that was the last that was the the oil in her lamp that gave her a vision on the direction in which she should go so many things were dropped in our laps by what brother branham said he said he not walked with god and he was translated i like that because sometimes we don't even understand what translation is that means enoch was taken from this place to another sometimes we get confused with translation and transfiguration translation is what philip did he was changed from one place and he took found himself in another and you know what there was no physical change but the character the power of god that was in him was enabled him to change from one place to another this is what god is trying to do within us he's trying to build a character in us that when he wants us to be somewhere it becomes a thought and we change from that place to another there's a lot of mysteries about william branham that we don't know things that he kept to himself but if you literally search out some of the things that he said you'll find out something was different how can be he be here and there at the same time many times i thought he was just there you know by vision sometimes he was and sometimes he was by way of another way but here we are come to a place and don't tell me it's impossible if god translated phillip he could also translate william branham and not only that philip was not a prophet he can also translate you but you got to be packing the goods and this is what this message came to do enlighten us come to a place where we must understand his kingdom is come if you have the holy spirit on the inside of you it's not a second person it's not the third person it is the person he said at that day what day this day the miracle of god indwelling human fallen flesh because he's holy hello even in the old days amen the old testament you know not even an ox or goat or any animal could come close to the mountain where his holiness was god's holiness is beyond anything we can imagine we can't even fathom it but by god's grace he gave us a little piece of it a down payment amen of what it's like understand the holiness of god is connected to god he is holy you can't even be holy without him think about god how he he he used even moses when it came to the plagues you know they say to my he's working by the finger of god now if god can destroy a whole country a nation of people by the finger by his finger what else can he do and god has placed something within the bride that's not just a finger it's the very voice of god now i don't know about you but i believe this message the bride is the voice of god in this age coming from a quote israel in the church number four he he said and they this is the thing of god hallelujah i think of that finger of god god could open a blind eye by his finger this is the thing of god could do all these things look what he did with his finger he healed the sick he raised the dead all these things done with his finger what do you mean i said like this jesus when that woman was caught in adultery jesus went down and he used the finger of god hallelujah moses saw god's finger when the ten commandment was being written understand god is a spirit and that spirit is the holy ghost so when you say god uses his finger he's saying god uses his spirit to cast out devils why the bible said it is the anointing that destroys the yokes this is why it's so important you know we we must understand amen not just having the spirit of god because remember laodicea had the spirit of god in the measure they were able to cast out devils they did miracles they did signs they did wonders yet not being converted the disciples did wonders not being converted had not even gone to pentecost yet but it still was the holy spirit because only god can heal and only god can deliver but i want you to think about it think about the god that created all things living in you and yet we live like underprivileged children upc and we fail to see amen what god is doing with us disrespectful we are sometimes we come to church as though we're sitting in a lecture we there is no joy no peace no nothing and we're listening and but are we perceiving are we receiving what he says i believe in change and i believe that when we come to church and leave we should never go back out the way we came in think about it god does more with you not only can god deliver you but brother baron said when he went after a lost sheep he never used his finger he put him on his shoulder and brought him in hallelujah he said what a security a lost sheep on his shoulder not his finger he didn't even use he used his shoulder to pack the sheep in so you said well i make it if you on his shoulder he'll bring you in on his shoulder and the strongest part of a man is his shoulder they asked jesus said lord teach us how to pray prayer is so scrupled up people don't know how to pray they want to pray selfishly sometimes when people pray they they want to pray revenge but let me tell you something the bride never prays for revenge hello under the law they pray for revenge even in the old testament i mean excuse me the new testament right those souls under the altar cries out how long how long when abel was struck dead the blood of abel cried out see god amen bride does not call for revenge she's like stephen father forgive them for they know not what they do and when you pray for revenge it never will happen it's not the perfect will of god for you to do that you're not even under the right inspiration you're like elijah lord send down the fire when you pray prayer is a worship it's thanksgiving it's adoring god it's not just lord with a list god give me this give me that and if you give me this i'll do that that's not prayer that's bargaining you don't have to bargain with god hello he didn't say whatsoever you bargained with me he said whatsoever you ask in my name believing it it shall be given oh don't no i'm not knocking on nobody i've done it i'm guilty i don't do that anymore but i've been guilty of doing the very same thing how are you going to keep a covenant with god when no man of all all men of all ages have always failed him you love the lord coming into this thing he says lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil listen for thine is the kingdom in other words god you're the power you're the glory it's not me dying is the kingdom and if i'm living in the kingdom i'm living in your power i'm living in your glory that's the way it must be we must use these tools that's what the word is for this is what bride comes into she begins to amen every word she punctuated with an amen this is what he said this is what he means and this is what is going to happen mark 10 23 let's turn there and it reads and jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god a brother and i was talking just the other day and every one of us in here are rich you may not think you are but you are all i got to do is compare you with india and some of these places like mexico that where people don't even have a chain water to bathe in or food or toothbrush you understand me we're rich because we have change of clothes we have food and most of all he blesses us every day we just don't understand it and sometimes we take those riches those wealthy things those things that god gives us like laodicea and we feel like we have need of nothing but let me tell you something you have need of god until your soul is filled you have need of god because what would it what good would it do the word of god says if you gain the whole world what is this what is this you know i i don't want to talk about things out in the world but let me tell you something it's it doesn't matter how great star you are you can be the greatest so-called superstar out there and all it takes is one mistake and like ravenous wolves and like vultures they could eat you alive why there's no true love out there fame and fortune means nothing ask lucifer he'll tell you his story all it does is lift you up and make you think you better than somebody else and let me tell you something you're not part can't call the kiddo greasy you understand me we're all i don't care what nationality you are the bible says we've all sinned and come short of the glory of god i love that scripture especially when people think they're better than me i'm not better than no one and what i am is what god has made me same to you watch this thing because you got to realize amen you don't you're not here to make a name for yourself you're here to make a name for jesus you don't have a kingdom none of us have kingdoms to put people in and you'll find out that everybody that sought to make themselves a name fail and the disciples was astonished at these words but jesus answered again and said unto unto them children how hard it is for them that have trust in riches to enter the kingdom of god let me say it like this people who trust in their churches people who trust in their pastors people who trust i mean your pastor can't save you your church can't save you there's only one savior and that's the lord jesus christ if you put your trust in anything other than the word of god to save you you are truly antichrist but god don't care i've been in the message well those with with moses was in the message too don't mean nothing until you change that spirit it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god y'all understand what he's saying who is the kingdom dying is the kingdom how can you enter into god until you become nothing one thing about the camel he had to humble himself to get through the eye of the needle the camera has to crawl and you know what he also has to take every one of those burdens backpacks and everything off of him before he could ever go through see that's how it is you can't enter god amen with some of your stuff everything has to be set aside you must become naked before god before he could ever clothe you they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and jesus looked upon them saying with men it is impossible but with god for with god all things are possible then peter began to say unto him lord we have left all and have followed thee you see peter said well what is that i've given it up all i've given everything up everything we have he says and jesus answered and said verily verily i say unto you the you there is no man that have left houses now he began to break it down you've left everything there's no men that have left house or brethren or sister a father or wife or children or children or lands that means everything he's named must be given up hello you got to cut it loose first of all you cannot save anybody with all of your witnessing you still can't save anybody you can live the most holy life amen uh and people can realize that or or see that you're different but instead of saying you know i wouldn't mind you know having what joe got no it doesn't work like that the bible said this world can't comprehend light just like the true children of god can't comprehend darkness now let me hurry up because i'm going too slow but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and you can't get it no better than that when you think you've given everything up god said i'm gonna bless you by doing so amen i'm gonna give you what a hundredfold that means no room for more i'm gonna give you a hundred for whatever that is in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecution there you go and in the world to come eternal life in other words what he said i'm going to give you a royal family amen i'm going gonna give you brothers and sisters who they've got all of this and when they really brothers and sisters whatever they have is yours y'all got quiet on that because listen real brothers and sisters will say come on in and make yourself at home we're brothers and sisters are real brothers and sisters you know you're not the other brothers and sisters real brothers and sisters become fathers they become mothers you know what i'm saying we we we understand all of these things and he says now you're gonna have a hundredfold but i'm gonna give you some persecution with that and that's the part we don't want but you know what persecution is a blessing [Laughter] he said if you're not persecuted if you don't go through no suffering you are not mine that's what he said blessed is the man or woman who suffer persecution for what my name say persecution is part of it and when you don't get it you need to double check now persecution don't always come from outside most of the time it comes from family even your family get jealous oh you think you're holier than now you think you're better now let's move on the kingdom of god always is hidden from the religious ones that's what gets me a lot of time people are so religious and they think being religious is being holy when it is not religion is nothing but a covering pharisees were religious but on the inside there were dead men bones many people in the messenger religious ain't got a drop of life may god help us because really as long as you marry to a system instead of jesus christ huh you're dead men's bones you say well what do you mean jesus said because i live you shall live wait when i thought i thought his disciples was already living but they were not they were living naturally but they had not yet been quickened they had not received the holy ghost and as long as you out here in heaven received the holy ghost you're dead while you're living and pleasure will be your portion pleasures of the world are not pleasures of god at his right hand there's pleasures forevermore what who is his right hand jesus christ that's where our pleasures are supposed to be amen christianity it's not an extracurricular activity it is something you just don't put on on wednesday you just you know we're gonna we're gonna put it on on a sunday no sir christianity is life you can't change from a sheep to a wolf and then from a wolf to a sheep your nature will define you you and i must understand it's a hidden thing it's the greatest thing that ever struck the earth we didn't understand it we as pentecostals we thought when you shout you got it when you dance you got it when you run you got it when you come to church you got it brother man say you can pay your tithes you can do all of that but until you baptized with the holy ghost until you've got god on in you it won't mean a thing and that is the kingdom and when the kingdom comes in you hello you become the housing of god the bible called it the temple of god right amen mark 4 11-12 you know what i this has been my prayer god i i don't want just a church i don't want a pastor a church i want to be be the pastor of the bride amen i want to see lives changed it cannot be the pastor you know that's that's catholicism when you think that the only holy man is the priest and that's the way they live as catholics you know or even some of these apostolics a pentecostal church the pastor is the holy one and we're just following him and he's going to take us in yeah he'd take you in if you holy with him no excuses and my thing is either we're at a place of change or we're going to be left behind that's the truth that's what happened to pentecost when god sent malachi 4 to bring them to repentance god gave them that space to repent and they would not and what did god do he left him behind brother ben said when god opened those seals god calls laodicea to fall asleep and right now they think they are awake they think that they're right in the the spirit of god because they're they they're casting out devils that miracles are still there but they're missing the greatest of all miracles laodicea he knocked at the door and says if you would open up to me i would come in and i'll sup they missed it that god was saying this is the hour this is the day that you'll come to a place to know that i am in you and you are in me and with us you and me in the father we become one this is the kingdom this is what god is talking about he's not talking about religion everybody's got it religion muslims got religion buddhas have religion but what's on the inside what are you covering and what's covering you it's yours listen mark 4 11-12 says and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins shall be forgiven them god said in laodicea they will be blind naked and don't even know it it was their choosing what nakedness you're talking about not just naturally spiritually you don't have a house without god there is no word body for you help us lord it's yours the revelation of god in this day is christ in you not by just feeling it manifesting manifesting that's what made malachite fall different from everybody else it was the manifestation of the word for that day that made him who he was you can't oh i'm right i'm right everybody's saying their bride but pride is a manifestation of christ in you and how can you manifest him if you don't know he's come for that reason that was the purpose of god that he would enhouse people like they said to jesus when he says i and the father are one and they took up stones to crucify to kill him to stone him and he said for what reason will you pick those stones up to stone me he said because you being a man make yourself god and brother branham said it like this they had it backwards it was god who was making himself a man and that's what god is doing now in individuals god manifesting himself in man a natural sinful fleshly man that's the power of the blood amen amen hallelujah christ is the mystery of god reveal amen brother battle says i love that christ is the mystery of god revealed prove the word mystery christ is god revealed that's who god is you love the lord in that message paragraph 609 he says identified oh the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone it ain't in laodicea that's what happened you know that's what happened to laodicea that's what happened to a lot of message people they don't want to go further they want to keep all of the the thing dangles of of the pentecostal agent and all of that stuff they had wasn't right if it was all right we wouldn't have needed a profit but we can't go backwards because listen it didn't work for them what make you think is going to work for you god is a progressive god oh y'all don't got quiet on me now because that's what they every age that's what they do instead of going forward they go fall backwards but this is not a digression this is a progression we must go forward it doesn't you know the bible says you know leaving all of these other things behind and let us press toward the mouth let us press toward perfection listen that doesn't mean you know you can't rejoice that doesn't mean you can't enjoy jesus no no no you're not taking away you're adding to but don't you must add two you just can't keep what you had if you keep just what you had and that's what i find out that you know even in this message you know we we've got all of this emotional stuff going on now and nothing's wrong with it i love it y'all know i love that but i know one thing that's not it i had that in in the apostolic church you understand what i'm saying we shouted we danced we spoke in tongues we were gifted we had all hey preachers oh yes we had them but that wasn't it it was a part of it but the message came to take us to perfection bring us to a maturity where god can entrust you putting away the childish things like oh well um how can i say let me give you give you an example listen let me say it like this if i never feel god again i know i got him on the inside i don't go by my feelings it's faith that declares him but oh i don't feel god i just feel lost i don't feel lost no because i don't feel him means nothing amen because he's in my soul and there's no feelings there only faith what's going to happen when you sick and you don't feel the anointing anointing you then you understand what i'm saying pain racking your body oh god doesn't love because the pain rack in my body nonsense that's childish that's what we do god you all these bad things happen to me you don't you must not love me that shows you still a child and you need to grow up isn't that true it is we come to church and we always please and god are singing what oh god you this you my dis and you mind this you've done this for me you've done that for me you've done this for me and then what we can say what songs we gonna start writing on how we doing what he you know him you understand me what what song we need songs that's gonna worship him and not us he's always been good he's always done well he don't need us to tell us him how good he is what god wants to see is himself in you that's the greatest praise you could ever give god is to let him have full control of you but that's nothing but the truth there was a boy in south carolina he looked just like michael jackson just like him hair face everything riding down you know the streets you know what i mean and you know i thought myself that is the greatest praise he could ever give michael jackson the greatest worship you got these people amen trying to impersonate you know uh elvis presley that's the greatest worship you could ever give ever presley and the greatest phrase of worship you can give god is to let god impersonate himself in you that's the truth we shouldn't fear diseases we shouldn't fear nothing because there is no fear in god the thing about it is what i realized this is that when we ask god to heal us we expect god to snap crack a pop and we want him to heal us on our own time instead of the devil say see you don't love you and god didn't heal you that's a lie that that's one of the biggest lies he ever told the point is in his time he makes all things beautiful but we want god to do it our turns it's not it ain't going to happen he let that man stay there at the gate of beautiful all those years what about the pool of salon and he must have gotten frustrated many times when he tried to run into that pool and somebody beat him huh as if god never hurt him god heard his prayer what and he came down personally that's what we don't understand god always hear us when did god become death and you don't even have to scream for them to hear you the bible said he picks up your thoughts and you and i must understand god loves us if he didn't love you listen people with all that sin stuff you and i have done we'd have been dead long time ago but god has put us in an age that called it grace and mercy i'm grateful i'm blessed to be standing right here right now and you're blessed to be setting where you are healthy and strength and all that kind of stuff in your right mind you could be somewhere dribbling your lips and slobbing but god got you in your right mind it's these things that we fail to look at and see amen what god i don't know how he put up with us you know i'm laughing but you know that's the kind of love and patience i want to have i want to be like him that i could put up with the even the unlovable or love the unlovable i want that i want all that he is in me i want to see that on display so much so i don't have to think about it i don't want to process as long as i'm processing it he's not in full control but when he's in full control i don't have to process it i just do it they said lord when did we feed the poor when did we visit you in prison they were so engaged with god they never never thought about it that's the kind of life i desire to have and i'm not going to stop until i see him completely manifested through me if i become the greatest and the only oddball in this day that's what i want people can call me crazy but i know what i'm looking at and it goes on and says and his church stands alone listen what he's saying i want you to hear what this quote is saying and this is christ the mystery of god revealed and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen what she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promised to her what she is now do y'all understand what that means when you were quickened to this message that was your place of resurrection amen that's what started it it's not that you're going not gonna go in into the fullness of it but that's when you came amen and the holy ghost came in you and you was quickened from death unto life translated setting in heavenly places in christ jesus you're not of this world and neither are you in this world half per se because there's a part of you that's in heavenly places right now now if i'm risen that means i was dead paul wrote about it many times you he has quickened amen who were dead and in trespasses and sin you and then he goes on and says but now you are the sons of god that's john not tomorrow today amen oh i wish i could preach it like i see it you know at some point in time i think god's going to get tired of our complaining yeah sarah did laugh but she didn't continue to laugh and at some point in time god gave her strength that she could see that the revelation that that the angel was giving given to her was giving to her was her she was the one you got to realize amen the message that the angel gave to us is for us we're the ones who bring the promised sun we're the one we're the impregnated ones who have god on the inside and he's maturing in us as paul said grow up into him you can't just say i'm i'm bride and you're still the same place you were what a few years ago there's got to be some changes somewhere search for it search it's got to be something something that's going to signify that you're alive how a bride holds that promise he told me he would return after me i believe it see yes sir to meet her headship her redeemer her husband her king her lord her lover her savior in the provided play meeting place let me ask you something where do you meet him when did you meet him the provided place to meet him was in this message in the message of malachi thor in the opening of the word that's where you meet him oh come on somebody you're looking at a natural body i'm working with christ christ is the kingdom christ is god jesus is god amen how are you going to be an invisible union and you never meet him who did you unite with christ why because now you are his body you are his temple and if he's living in you why don't you let him live put him on display stop hiding your light under a bushel put it somewhere that can be seen don't be ashamed to let people know who you stand for i told a guy today i said they can do a lot of things but one thing i know about about this experience i have they can't bawl him out of me they can't burn him out of me they can't cut him out of me he's in there for good i love my lord i just got to love him like he loved me how a bride holds that promise he told me he would return after me come on somebody what kind of pastor you think god's supposed to be just let us go on and not say something the word of god is here to correct us and you and i need to accept correction and move on with god ask god for a greater and deeper revelation this is what the message is all about is that right the god the bible says you know anoint your eyes with assad that you might see right understand gold tried in the fire trial is going to come hard breaks are going to come it ain't going to be your dog or your cat it's going to come through people to meet her headship her redeemer her husband her king and you know you gotta meet him before you meet him he's got a place to meet them brother said the provided place was the provided place you've read the message you've heard the message there's only one provided place of worship and that's under the blood and that's not natural that's spiritual unto christ in christ alone i give my glory in christ alone i give him my praise in christ alone right a lot of times people think well you know because i say brother branham when i say the name brother brandon william branham that's gonna get me into heaven i'm sorry you're just as wrong as you can be god told nicodemus you must be born again that's the only way that kingdom that we're talking about christ you can't come there any kind of way you must die and wrought to yourself and and you know what that means get rid of all your pride and all of the things you think you've got you're holding on to you got to get rid of it a big price to pay but a small price to pay for eternal life he's got a place to meet them you know the bridegroom don't leave out nothing he's got the ring the identification he's got the robe that she wears her clothing see and he's got the provided place to meet her that is in the air everything has been all provided he's got the wedding softball already set guests already invited already chosen it makes you wonder how he come in 1963 he was he met us in the air he he literally showed us and that's just the beginning of of our change but you know what you got to come to a place where the divine nature and you can literally put you in a place to be can i say it like this teleport it translate it because you got to realize even the bride of jesus christ after the millennium after the burning of the whole world right what brother adam says god didn't translate us he transports us that means he'd take us from one place and bring us back to earth to fulfill the word of god that god told adam replenish the world or the earth and people looking at me like i'm crazy but i don't care i really don't you say well i don't know what you're preaching i don't you know i can't make you see what i see but i can truly tell you that i know that i'll give account for everything i'm saying and one thing i know is that that god is changing me amen i am not the same man i was a few months ago a few years ago i see the changes happening in me and i am absolutely excited about it because you know why because eventually this change is going to take bring me to a place it's going to bring me into a word body and that word body is going to bring me into a glorified body absolutely that's what this message came for brother said it would give you rapturing faith what is rapturing faith for jesus christ himself he said i am the resurrection and i am the life no man comes to the father but by me and jesus christ is christ cast out devils listen it's his kingdom and his order talking about a new world this is what he's trying to say listen let me say it like this what we see and understand about this world is going to be completely destroyed completely completely we don't even know the kind of body we getting ready we call it a glorified body we don't understand it but one thing i know brother brown said when he was a cross on the other side he said they don't even sleep they don't breathe they don't have to take breaths whatever body it is amen you can touch them you can feel if there's no sex glands in them and even all of that is going to be destroyed for the new one heaven and earth shall pass away this kingdom is beyond anything you and i can imagine the body that will have will be just like his and i'm going to close cl shortly because i i can see you getting tired but my point is this there's only one worthy and that's the lord jesus christ those 24 elders they they they they you know they put they threw their crowns down and said doll were they down worthy ah you're talking about quicken you got to be quickened and then that quickening will change you and that change will bring you to a translation that's the truth i i never saw it before like this but you know a translator what is he doing a translator when he takes french and take the concept of french and change it from french change it from one place to another into english that i might understand it or vice versa that's why we call it a translator he it's the same words but those words have changed place and position now it was with the man who was speaking french but now it's in me now right that's how translation works philip was moved from the revival to the desert and with no physical change as we know of which different than those bodies on mount transfiguration i don't understand it but i know they were in glorified bodies and the bodies were so glorified that the light of god shone bright brighter than the noonday sun and the disciples said when it was so impressive that you know they wanted to build three tabernacles all i know is this the bible tells me that the new jerusalem the new world won't need the light of the sun because the lamb is the light now you got to understand it ain't just talking about jesus the very g the very light of jesus will be a is that right am i mistaken oh let me read the scripture says and he carried me away into the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that a great that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god doing what having the glory of god and her light like unto the stone most precious even like jasper clear as crystal what was it the very pillar of fire the very light of god is now shining through her guess what and her name is his name that's the word i'm closing on this because you know what sometimes we just don't understand what god is doing and has done for us we we wallow in our our shame and our sin and you know what you know the bible said you know that what god has done supposed to take away your guilt consciousness but we let the devil throw all these things on us as if god oh god didn't know i was going to mess up nothing you can do can ever change his mind about you god loved you from the beginning he loved you in eternity before and he loved you in eternity afterwards if that makes sense once god sealed you you know he can't change his mind he's perfect and what makes you love this message even though you know you can't live it for the very fact that he lived it for me i'm accepted in his beloved i'm accepted in his love you got to understand because i'm accepted god will bring the change there's not a tree or a flower or bush out there could ever brag on doing nothing everything that happens in a tree god makes it happen that tree can't say i worked hard today and i wanted plenty of fruits no everything that tree's potential was in the seed and all it had to do was stay in the presence of the sun and the sun brought it forth that sun represents god you stay in the word you might be a little slow at getting there but you'll get there god will bring you so much soul he said he never left one behind here's my clothes coming from the message exposition of the seven church ages i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god and what is the name of god well he was god with us or emmanuel but that was not his given name thou shalt call his name jesus jesus said i came in my father's name and you received me not therefore the name of god is jesus for that is the name he came in he is lord jesus christ and what name does a woman take when she marry the man she takes his name it will be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her to himself revelations 21 1-4 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth was passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepare as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall dwell they shall be his people now dwell means you understand that don't mean part-time living that means he dwells there that's his habitation and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and they shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither there shall be any more pain for the former things are passed away we can't imagine that how wonderful all of god's wonderful promises fulfilled it will be all over the change will have been completed that's when the change is completed but right now we're in the process of completing it the lamb and his bride forever settled in all the perfection of god y'all believe what i'm saying do y'all believe what we're reading describe it who is able to do that no one think about it dream about it read what the word says about it yes we can do all that yet we can only know an in infinite and uh infinite some infinitesimal part of it until it becomes reality in the first resurrection so we just just get little small pieces of what's really happening and you know i tell you what what really encourages me people get about thomas doubting thomas you know but one thing about thomas he got it he may have had oh lord let me put you see god works with you he knows how he made you so he works with you everybody's different and god will work with you according to your makeup but with that being said at some point in time that has to change because your nature must die and thomas had not gone to pentecost yet the nature was still living he said no one think about it dream about it read what the word says about it yes we can do all of that yet we can only know an intermissible invincible uh part mo of it's until it becomes reality in the first resurrection here you go and i will write my new name upon him my new name when all becomes new then he will take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the bride also what that name is none dare conjecture it would have to be a revelation of the spirit given so conclusively that none would dare deny it but no doubt he will lead that revelation to the day when he desired to give that name forth suffice it no that uh suffice it to know that it will be more wonderful than we could ever imagine so let us not be deceived i'm going to stop there what made you a man what made you a woman why did you become why did you arrive in here as a horse or a dog or a cat or a pig or a butterfly or an ant or a worm you've got to realize that all those manifestations they were thoughts of god they didn't just happened and what what made you who you are why the life of god was given to you when millions upon millions of babies didn't make it and why why did god put you in a place which is the greatest message that ever struck the earth why did he put you put that in your face and then he comes along and tells you law and grace does not mix you struggle with laws then you're gonna you're gonna find yourself miserable if you don't believe that god has justified you as though you haven't sinned in the first place see because a true believer he doesn't wake to a week to confess as soon as he make mistakes he said father forgive me lord i'm sorry and his his mind is to live it because that's the christ in it like babies you know they don't mean to fall but they fall they don't mean to stumble but they stumble but they steal children they steal babies and a lot of times you know we think we all grown but your actions give you away the bible said you know we need to look at ourselves see whether we stand in the faith the bible is there for our correction it's there to let us see where how far we're it's our measuring stick it's christ in you this nine talking about human effort that's the problem systematically we we work with human effort that's not what i'm talking about it ain't about your human effort that changes you you can look so righteous and so holy and you're righteous there will be filthy rags in the eyes of god we need god to change us that's why brother branham says lay in the presence of the son let this word bake all the green out of you bring that change to you without you trying to muster it up and work it up and bump it up and whatever up you can do with it because that's not it that's coming to trust what you hear and believe that he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it it's coming to a place to to recognize i am bright regardless to how faulty you may be now a revival for the bride is what it is happening now because we've had so much trash left in our lives amen and we picked up a lot of trash from from uh uh laodicea you know god has to clean us up this is what i call the bride revival god getting all the trash out of our lives so that he can really fill us like he wants us and want to and live in us like he want to live in us you know people are you uh let me tell you let me say this in closing what are the uh scriptures that have always stuck with me uh perhaps more than any and that scripture says only the pure in heart shall see god and i work very hard to keep my heart pure just the other day i was very angry at something that took place in my household i was very angry i said my house were among my family and i just got more angry that i haven't i can't even tell you how it's been i would say tons of years before since i've been that angry i i i just can't explain it i didn't even know i could get there i thought all of that part of me was dead but i went to the cold stone and i took my grandson there and um that little they had a little fella there looked like he was just down talking me you know a little young boy and and i'm thinking you know this fella need to have a little more respect talk to me better than what he's talking now you got to understand i was not in the holy ghost i was not in the right spirit so whatever i was going to hear was going to always you know when you're in god no matter how weird or how wicked a person talk with you you could still get some sweetness out of it but when it came to this guy i i got real snappy snappy snappy and you know i left out of that restaurant feeling pretty bad you know what i because i knew i was going to have to go back and confess i was going to have to make it right and you know what i did not just that uh i told it when i was down there and i would see the same little story but just the other day i walked in that restaurant i didn't need no ice cream but i got some anyway i got a big thing of vanilla and that's i think if i anyway so still haven't eaten any of it yet but i went in there to apologize that was a purpose and you know what's so funny about it i asked i told that guy in the face of everybody that was there i didn't care who was in there i told him young man i said i really owe you an apology i said i came in here the other day i was in a bad spirit i was not in in the right spirit and i was really snappy and disrespectful uh you know what he said well i didn't even notice it i said i'm so glad you did but i said i had a need to ask you for your forgiveness and then i went to to pay my bill i tried to give him five dollars and rejected it i had the money on the card but whatever happened it didn't happen so i had to do it again and i said well did you get the five dollars on there he says no but i said you know i said in my mind maybe the next time when i come but i took that five dollars as my own grace that god gave me grace see you you you you can't be somebody how could i say it that boy didn't even look like a christian i don't know but maybe one day he will be and he'll know amen that that there are those who are kind everybody is not mean i don't know what god was doing in his life but then there was another man back there that i normally see and he came out after that all was said and done and he's seen me he knows i'm a preacher and all that and we talked and stuff like that but i don't know who that was for but sometimes when you think you're wrong and you are sometimes it looks like you're in the wrong place at the right time god turns it out for your good honestly i felt so good after i had it i mean the ice cream and all of that was you know my delight but my point is i felt so clean after i confessed to that young man that's the kind of person god has changed me into because you know there was a time you know what i would say just like everybody else oh he'll get over it but that's not everything you go through every stumble every fall everything that has been orchestrated in your life is for you and god expects you to correct it y'all i say it like this in closing remember brother branham i think he brought something over the border and i forgot how many miles away he was from the mexico border and he turned all the way back round and took it back because he said he didn't have it how many of y'all would have done that now i'm laughing but you know what that takes god character that takes pleasing god right there's a time you know i've been through the grocery store lying and they make a mistake i said uh uh-uh i said that ain't the way it's supposed to be and the girl said go head on and i go head on and i go out the store and i'm feeling just like i stole something because i did because it wasn't hers to give you understand me but in my mind i didn't want to get her in trouble but i got in trouble with god only the pure heart shall see god people these little things that you think don't matter they matter and until we start to identify these little things these little foxes are the things that spoils the vine all i can say is the bride was dressed there was no spot no wrinkle no blemish and you got to watch everything you do everything you say if it's not of god make it god make it right you understand me let's stand how can i say thanks for the things you've done for me things so undeserved yet you gave to prove your love to me the voices of a million angels cannot express my gratitude all that i am and [Music] to god be the glory to god be the glory to god be the glory all the things he has done oh just let me live my life [Music] lord let it be pleasing lord if should i gain [Applause] any praise [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] with his power he has raised [Music] [Music] be the glory to god be the glory to god be the glory for the things he has done [Music] [Music] he had me to god be the glory for the things he has done [Music] lord just let me live my life [Music] and let it be pleasing [Music] [Music] he [Music] he is [Applause] [Music] be the glory
