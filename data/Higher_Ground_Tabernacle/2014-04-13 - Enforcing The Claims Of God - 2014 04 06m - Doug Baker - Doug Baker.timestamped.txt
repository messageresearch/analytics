[0:00] together. Amen. So, if you'd stand, we'd
[0:01] like to get into the word. And um it
[0:04] just hit me when I was back there in the
[0:07] office um that today's April 6. And it
[0:11] was in April 6 of 1909 that our
[0:15] messenger was brought to the earth. So,
[0:18] it's been 105 years now, I guess.
[0:21] Actually, the message didn't sound until
[0:23] about 51 years ago. you know, it's a the
[0:26] the messenger always comes at the end of
[0:27] the age and the message. And anyway,
[0:30] we're we're so grateful for what God is
[0:33] has done and is doing in our our day.
[0:37] I'd like to read from uh a portion of
[0:40] scripture. Now, I don't have uh anything
[0:43] uh you know, some deep mystery. My my
[0:46] desire is to just to put my shoulder
[0:49] behind what's already been taught, what
[0:51] you already know. But if I can stir it
[0:53] up and remind you and cause you to step
[0:55] out with it, well, you know, we'll be
[0:57] content. We'll be we'll feel like we've
[0:59] we've uh done the will of the Lord. So,
[1:01] I'd like to read from Psalms chapter 23,
[1:04] verses 1-6. Very familiar scripture. Uh
[1:08] but I trust that it'll be spiritual food
[1:10] in due season.
[1:12] Actually, the Lord put this thought in
[1:14] my heart a couple of weeks ago, and so
[1:15] we just uh want to be faithful.
[1:18] A Psalm of David. The Lord is my
[1:22] shepherd. I shall not want. That means I
[1:25] shall not be without anything. It
[1:27] doesn't mean you won't have a desire. It
[1:28] just means that he's not going to leave
[1:30] you wanting.
[1:32] He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:35] pastures. He leadeth me beside the still
[1:39] waters. Now, this is a man after God's
[1:40] own heart that doesn't have the baptism
[1:42] of the Holy Ghost. He's a man under the
[1:44] blood of bulls and goats. What about the
[1:46] offspring of God this morning?
[1:48] He restoth my soul.
[1:52] He leadeth me in the paths of
[1:54] righteousness for his name's sake. He's
[1:58] leading me for his name's sake. Yay,
[2:02] though I walk through the valley of the
[2:04] shadow of death. Now, friends, that's
[2:06] what we're doing right now. We're living
[2:08] in a shadow realm. We're we're stepping
[2:10] into that bright light. We're coming
[2:12] into the fullness, but we've been
[2:15] walking in the shadow of death.
[2:19] Not for long, though.
[2:20] Amen.
[2:21] I will fear no evil.
[2:23] Amen.
[2:23] For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[2:27] staff, they comfort me.
[2:30] Friends, his rod and his staff is not to
[2:32] beat you. It's not to condemn you. It's
[2:33] not to run you into the ground. It's to
[2:35] comfort you.
[2:36] Amen.
[2:37] Hallelujah.
[2:38] Thou preparest the table. I heard
[2:40] brother uh uh Isaac this morning saying,
[2:43] "Lord, you've got a table for us." And
[2:45] thou preparest a table before me. We've
[2:48] got a message called the table.
[2:51] In the presence of mine enemies, thou
[2:54] anointest my head with oil. The Holy
[2:57] Spirit, my cup runth over. Surely
[3:02] goodness and mercy shall follow me
[3:06] all the days of my life,
[3:08] whether I perceive it or not, it shall
[3:10] follow me all the days of my life, and I
[3:14] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[3:17] forever.
[3:18] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Kind heavenly
[3:20] father, we're just so grateful to be
[3:22] gathered together, Lord, in the with
[3:24] those of like precious faith. And
[3:26] father, we know that there's no
[3:27] coincidences. We know that you've been
[3:28] guiding our footsteps. And father,
[3:30] you've been doing a work here and you
[3:32] brought a gift into this area, Lord,
[3:34] because you knew that there were
[3:35] thoughts that you had planted. You knew
[3:38] what time and season they'd be planted,
[3:40] what bed they'd be planted here in Iowa,
[3:41] Lord, in De Moine and in the in the
[3:44] area, Lord. And so, you sent a
[3:45] ministering gift. You gave gifts unto
[3:48] men. You send a ministering gift, Lord,
[3:50] to minister to your people, to edify
[3:52] them, to encourage, to strengthen, to
[3:54] lift them up, to show them who they are,
[3:56] Father, to bring them into that that
[3:58] that relationship with you and uh bring
[4:01] you to a maturity, oh God, Father, and
[4:03] it's you working through your ministry.
[4:06] We believe that with all of our heart.
[4:07] And a minister is a servant. So, thank
[4:09] you for your servant, oh God. But,
[4:11] Father, you got many servants here this
[4:13] morning. And Father, the fact of the
[4:14] matter is anyone that's part of your
[4:16] body is a servant. We've all been sent
[4:18] to to serve in one capacity or another.
[4:21] But Father, we're trusting in you this
[4:23] morning. We we we ask Lord that if we've
[4:25] done anything that's displeasing that
[4:27] you just forgive us, Lord. You know, our
[4:28] thoughts, our our hearts, our motives,
[4:30] and we make mistakes, Lord. We do things
[4:33] that that we don't want to do sometimes
[4:35] and it's not our our goal, but but
[4:37] Father, we we we place it in your hands
[4:40] this morning. Father, we ask you to just
[4:43] uh just Father, wipe it away. forgive
[4:46] us. And Lord, as we come into your
[4:48] presence, Father, as your word goes
[4:50] forth, may may the supernatural take
[4:53] place this morning.
[4:55] Father, may we be set free. May we may
[4:57] you be exalted, Lord. May you have the
[4:59] preeminence in this this local body,
[5:02] Lord, that you've placed here in this
[5:04] portion of the country. Bless my
[5:06] brothers, my sisters, Lord. I don't know
[5:07] what their needs are, but but you are a
[5:10] prayer answering God. You are still
[5:12] Jehovah Gyra this morning. You are the
[5:14] provider of all of our needs. So we look
[5:16] to you this morning, Lord. We surrender
[5:18] to you. And Father, we ask that you
[5:20] would receive all the honor and all the
[5:22] glory and have the preeminence in this
[5:24] local body this morning, Lord. Father,
[5:26] lift them up. Encourage and strengthen
[5:28] them as their light shining in this dark
[5:30] hour. You place these evening lights
[5:33] here, Lord, to shine. Father, bless and
[5:36] encourage. We pray. We love you and we
[5:37] thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[5:40] Amen. You may be seated. If you want to
[5:42] just keep your Bibles handy, we're going
[5:44] to read a couple of scriptures here this
[5:46] morning if you don't mind. And going to
[5:48] read from our messengers quote book, the
[5:51] Bible.
[5:53] I'd like to read from Psalms chapter 24.
[5:55] First of all, we're going to title the
[5:57] thought here this morning, enforcing the
[5:59] claims of of God.
[6:01] Not enforcing our claims, but enforcing
[6:03] his claims. Enforcing the claims of God.
[6:07] Psalms chapter 24 and verse 7. Lift up
[6:11] your heads, oh you gates, and be ye lift
[6:15] up, ye everlasting doors. The King of
[6:19] glory shall come in.
[6:20] Amen.
[6:21] Who is the King of glory? Oh, I just
[6:23] want to brag about him this morning.
[6:24] Amen.
[6:25] I just want to talk about him.
[6:27] I just want to recognize him for who he
[6:28] is.
[6:30] Who is the King of glory?
[6:33] The Lord
[6:34] strong and mighty.
[6:36] The Lord mighty in battle. You know, I
[6:39] almost feel sorry for my enemy. I almost
[6:43] I almost do because our enemy cannot
[6:46] stand
[6:47] in in the face of our Lord
[6:50] who's mighty in battle.
[6:52] He's never lost a battle. He'll never
[6:54] lose a battle.
[6:55] He's absolutely the captain of the host.
[6:57] Hallelujah.
[6:59] The Lord strong and mighty. The Lord
[7:01] mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, oh
[7:04] ye gates.
[7:05] Amen. Even lift up, lift them up, ye
[7:08] everlasting doors, and the king of glory
[7:11] shall come in. Not he might or maybe he
[7:13] shall come in.
[7:14] Who is this king of glory? The Lord of
[7:17] hosts. He is the king of glory.
[7:21] Sah.
[7:22] Now, I'd like to take you to a rapture
[7:24] message here for just a moment. We're
[7:25] gonna we'll start out with the first
[7:27] scripture and maybe we'll pick up on
[7:28] this here in a a little bit. Psalm
[7:31] chapter 27 and verse one. Now, brother
[7:33] Brandham took this this uh uh uh Psalm
[7:37] 27. It's the only place that he ever
[7:39] referred to it in the message and it was
[7:40] in the message the rapture preached
[7:43] right at the end of his message. Didn't
[7:45] really refer to it much, but he took
[7:47] this as his text. So, we're g by by
[7:49] God's grace, we'll touch on this a
[7:50] little bit this morning if the Lord
[7:52] will. A Psalm of David.
[7:55] The Lord is my light.
[7:57] Amen.
[7:58] I want somebody to say that this
[7:59] morning. The Lord is my light. Amen.
[8:02] The Lord is my light
[8:05] and my salvation.
[8:07] Amen.
[8:09] He's my light. He's my salvation. Whom
[8:13] shall I fear?
[8:17] Oh friends, if we ever let that if that
[8:19] ever strikes our heart, what am I what
[8:21] am I afraid of?
[8:22] What devil do I have to fear?
[8:25] I don't have to fear the falling
[8:27] economy. Everything the the bottom's
[8:29] falling out of everything. I don't have
[8:30] to be fearful of that.
[8:32] I don't have to be fearful of Ebola or
[8:34] cancer or anything else.
[8:37] What do I I don't have to be fearful of
[8:39] hell.
[8:40] Hell wasn't created for me.
[8:43] Hell was created for Satan and his
[8:45] angels.
[8:46] I'm a son of God.
[8:49] How many sons of God do we have here
[8:50] this morning? How many daughters of God?
[8:52] You're the very offspring of God. Don't
[8:54] fear hell.
[8:57] your destination.
[9:03] Whom shall I fear?
[9:05] That's a good question this morning.
[9:08] The Lord is the strength of my life.
[9:12] Of whom shall I be afraid?
[9:16] Of friends, isn't it interesting? Every
[9:18] time we ever had a visitation of an
[9:21] angel that had a message that was coming
[9:23] to the people, the very first thing they
[9:26] first identify who they are and then
[9:28] they say, "Fear not.
[9:30] I don't want you to be afraid. I
[9:32] understand why you are and this this
[9:34] supernatural presence and all that, but
[9:35] I want you to know I didn't come here to
[9:37] torment you.
[9:39] I didn't come here to to to to lord over
[9:42] you and to cause you to back up into a
[9:45] corner. I want you to know right away,
[9:46] get rid of all that fear.
[9:49] Don't you worry.
[9:51] So the spirit of the Lord doesn't bring
[9:53] fear.
[9:55] Hallelujah.
[9:56] Amen.
[9:58] The Lord is the strength of my life. Of
[9:59] whom shall I be afraid?
[10:02] So friends, we have been given authority
[10:05] that goes with the the particular
[10:08] position that the Lord has chosen each
[10:10] and every one of us to place us in in
[10:12] this hour.
[10:13] And every one of us has a place. Amen.
[10:15] There are no extra parts in the body and
[10:17] there are no useless parts.
[10:19] God has he this his work. He's putting
[10:22] it together. He said, "I'd build a
[10:23] church.
[10:24] He's been building it. He's been placing
[10:26] each member in there. He knew that you
[10:29] would be here." You've got a purpose.
[10:31] You're here. You make a difference.
[10:34] You're here for a reason. So, this is
[10:36] his choosing. It's not We never chose
[10:38] it. We didn't raise our hand and say, "I
[10:40] want to be this or that." This is his
[10:41] choosing. He's the one that makes the
[10:43] rules. And frankly, he can do whatever
[10:46] he wants.
[10:47] And I'm all right with that. Aren't you?
[10:49] I trust him.
[10:52] But friends, if we fail to recognize the
[10:55] authority that comes with our position
[10:57] in Christ,
[10:58] we will never exercise that authority
[11:02] to enforce the claims of God in our
[11:04] lives.
[11:05] And that's what I want to focus on this
[11:07] morning is that he's made some claims.
[11:09] Amen. But it's up to you to enforce
[11:12] them.
[11:14] So in the Old Testament and in the New
[11:16] Testament, the the Bible is just full of
[11:19] claims that the Lord has made on our
[11:22] behalf.
[11:23] Amen.
[11:24] In the Old Testament prophecies, what
[11:26] the we find what will be fulfilled
[11:29] completely by our Lord Jesus, our our
[11:32] savior, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[11:34] Christ. He was the fulfillment of the
[11:36] Old Testament prophecies. Amen.
[11:38] Now, Jesus in the New Testament, he
[11:40] personally instructs each and every one
[11:42] of us on what we are entitled to as born
[11:46] again citizens of the kingdom.
[11:49] We're citizens of another kingdom.
[11:51] You know, people think you're odd. You
[11:53] are.
[11:54] If you're not, then there's something
[11:55] wrong.
[11:56] You know, people look at you sometimes
[11:59] like you're an alien from another
[12:00] planet. Get used to it.
[12:02] You are. You're from another kingdom.
[12:05] You have a different language. You have
[12:07] different customs, a different way of
[12:09] dressing.
[12:09] Amen.
[12:10] You have a different king.
[12:12] You have different goals.
[12:15] Different privileges.
[12:16] Amen.
[12:17] Hallelujah.
[12:18] So, he he he told us what what uh uh uh
[12:22] he personally instructs us on what we're
[12:24] entitled to as born again sons and
[12:27] daughters of God. But then he instructs
[12:29] us on how to enforce the claims that
[12:31] he's already made on our behalf.
[12:34] Amen. Amen.
[12:35] Now, friends, he fully paid the price
[12:37] for us to be able to walk in those
[12:39] claims.
[12:40] There's nothing left for him to, you
[12:41] know, if we're not careful, we're
[12:43] waiting for something.
[12:45] The purchasing work is done.
[12:47] Yes, sir.
[12:47] Everything that you have need of, he's
[12:49] already paid the price for.
[12:51] Amen.
[12:52] And it belongs to us.
[12:54] Amen.
[12:54] But there's a difference between uh
[12:56] owning something and possessing
[12:58] something.
[13:00] Hallelujah.
[13:01] So, he's fully paid the price. That
[13:03] question is settled.
[13:04] Amen.
[13:05] When he said it was finished, he he
[13:07] didn't wasn't saying the work of
[13:08] redemption was finished at Calvary. What
[13:10] he was saying was that phase of the work
[13:12] was done. The purchasing work.
[13:14] Amen.
[13:15] He completely paid for everything that
[13:17] belongs to us.
[13:19] So Calvary left nothing unpaid.
[13:22] The debts are paid off by the shedding
[13:25] of the blood on Calvary.
[13:28] So his declarations or his claims don't
[13:31] leave us with any gray areas. And I'm so
[13:33] thankful for that this morning.
[13:35] The claims that he's made on our behalf,
[13:37] they're sure and they're right to the
[13:39] point.
[13:40] They're not wishywashy. They're not, you
[13:42] know, if you cross your fingers or if
[13:44] it's Friday or or if you step across the
[13:46] sidewalk crack or whatever, if the
[13:48] moon's in a certain phase, if you've
[13:50] been a good boy today,
[13:51] his claims are amen and amen.
[13:54] Amen.
[13:55] They are sure.
[13:57] Hallelujah.
[13:59] Ask and it shall be given unto you. Not
[14:02] asking maybe.
[14:03] Not asking if you've been a good person
[14:06] or if you just got through praying. Ask
[14:08] and it shall
[14:10] be given unto you.
[14:12] Amen.
[14:13] Seek and you shall find.
[14:16] Oh, we're familiar with these things,
[14:17] friends,
[14:18] but we need to take them and act on
[14:20] them.
[14:20] If you say to this mountain,
[14:23] be thou removed. Be cast to the sea.
[14:25] Don't doubt in your heart.
[14:26] Amen. If you if two or more agree
[14:29] concerning anything
[14:31] there's no gray area there.
[14:34] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[14:36] they shall recover.
[14:38] Amen.
[14:39] In my name they shall cast out devils.
[14:42] Amen.
[14:43] Hallelujah.
[14:44] Or how about this? John 20:23. Whosoever
[14:47] sins you remit, they are remitted unto
[14:49] them.
[14:50] And whosoever sins you retain, they are
[14:53] retained.
[14:54] Amen. Amen.
[14:54] See why forgiveness is so important?
[14:58] Resist the devil.
[15:00] And if if if if he feels like it, he
[15:03] might leave.
[15:05] No. Resist the devil and he shall flee.
[15:09] Now notice there's no mention of time in
[15:11] any of these promises.
[15:14] There's just a mention of this. You do
[15:15] this and that'll happen.
[15:17] This is how to do it. Here's my claim.
[15:19] Now, here's how you do it. Amen.
[15:22] I'm instructing you on how to take what
[15:24] I purchased for you and put it into
[15:26] action.
[15:26] Amen.
[15:28] James 5:14 is is any sick among you, let
[15:32] him call for the elders of the church.
[15:34] Amen.
[15:34] And let them pray over him,
[15:37] anointing him with oil in the name of
[15:39] the Lord,
[15:40] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[15:44] sick.
[15:44] Amen.
[15:46] And the Lord shall raise him up.
[15:48] Amen. And if ye have committed sins,
[15:51] they shall be forgiven him.
[15:54] Confess your faults one to another, and
[15:57] pray one for another that ye may be
[15:59] healed.
[16:00] Friends, this salvation that we're
[16:01] talking about is a healing of my soul.
[16:04] It's a healing of my spirit, and it's
[16:06] ultimately the healing of my body.
[16:08] I've got a down payment of it. Every
[16:10] time he gives me a temporary body change
[16:12] every time he heals me.
[16:14] Amen.
[16:14] But that's a down payment on the total
[16:16] healing of my body,
[16:18] which is the body change.
[16:20] Hallelujah. Confess your faults one to
[16:23] another. Pray one for another that you
[16:24] may be healed. The effectual fervent
[16:27] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[16:30] Amen.
[16:30] Now, now the the devil will get right
[16:32] there. Oh, now he said a righteous man
[16:34] and I'm not I'm Listen, he made you
[16:37] righteous.
[16:38] Amen. This is not something you do. It's
[16:40] what he did.
[16:43] Hallelujah. So these these are all
[16:45] claims that were made for the kingdom of
[16:48] heaven. This new kingdom that you are a
[16:49] citizen of that you're walking in. These
[16:52] are the laws of this new kingdom. And
[16:54] they're laws. They're impersonal. They
[16:55] don't care who you are, how tall, short,
[16:57] what color, educated, not educated,
[17:00] whether you got two nickels to rub
[17:01] together or a million dollars. They
[17:03] don't care.
[17:04] These are laws of this new kingdom.
[17:06] Glory.
[17:08] These are all claims that are made for
[17:10] the kingdom of heaven and against the
[17:12] kingdom of the devil.
[17:13] Amen.
[17:14] Amen.
[17:15] So we brothers and sisters as a body of
[17:17] Christ that's placed here on the earth.
[17:20] You've been placed here in this de
[17:21] moine's area wherever you're from.
[17:23] Amen.
[17:24] You've been placed here on the earth and
[17:25] you have been called and placed here in
[17:28] this hour. You one of one of the reasons
[17:30] why you're here is to enforce Calvar's
[17:33] claims. Amen.
[17:35] You've been placed here. God needs a
[17:38] body to work through.
[17:39] Satan needs a body to work through.
[17:41] We can look out there and we can say,
[17:43] "Oh, the devil's doing this and the
[17:44] devil's doing that and we can talk
[17:46] about, you know, how the the Catholic
[17:48] Church is coming to a head and this is
[17:50] coming to a head and that's coming to a
[17:51] head." Well, friends, if the negative is
[17:53] coming to pass
[17:55] and that guy's not in charge,
[17:57] how about what God said?
[18:00] God's word cannot fail. Hallelujah.
[18:03] So you have been placed here in this
[18:05] specific area to enforce heaven's
[18:08] claims.
[18:10] And to a forest what has already been
[18:12] accomplished on Calvary.
[18:14] This is from the message restoration of
[18:16] the bride tree. Is that is it okay if I
[18:17] just Okay. Uh uh page 17 paragraph 2. He
[18:20] says, "And if Satan has robbed you of
[18:22] the privilege of being a son or daughter
[18:25] of God, we have a right this morning by
[18:27] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of
[18:30] God." Amen.
[18:31] We have a right to enforce. Now notice,
[18:34] not our claim, his claim.
[18:37] Bring them back.
[18:39] If he's afflicted you and made you sick,
[18:41] we have a right before God to enforce
[18:44] the laws of God.
[18:45] By his stripes, we are healed.
[18:48] Friends, he's never going to heal me
[18:50] again. He's already done it.
[18:52] But we've got to enforce it.
[18:54] We've got to make that claim.
[18:56] We've got to we've got to stay. Reality
[18:59] is what you say it is.
[19:01] If you say, "Oh, it's gloom and doom and
[19:03] it'll never work and I'll never amount
[19:06] to anything." That's exactly what you're
[19:07] going to walk in.
[19:08] But if you say, "I can do all things
[19:10] through Christ that has strengthened me.
[19:12] By his stripes, I am healed." You speak
[19:15] that out, that'll become your reality,
[19:18] and you'll walk in it.
[19:21] We're We're waiting around for him to do
[19:23] something. He's done it. Now it's your
[19:26] turn
[19:28] to confess what he's already done
[19:30] and to enforce it.
[19:32] Amen.
[19:33] Hallelujah.
[19:35] If he's afflicted you and made you sick,
[19:37] we have a right before God to enforce
[19:39] the laws of God. By his stripes, we are
[19:42] healed.
[19:43] Amen. Bring him back. Turn them loose.
[19:46] You're taking them out yonder to death.
[19:48] We claim him.
[19:50] Bring him back.
[19:51] How many believes we can do that?
[19:54] Oh friends, he's done he's done so much
[19:57] just in my little little ministry,
[19:59] little life. I'm insignificant and in
[20:01] terms of lots of great men, lots of
[20:03] great ministries and all that, but he's
[20:05] done enough in my life.
[20:06] He don't have to do one more thing.
[20:09] You come along too late to say he don't
[20:11] do these things.
[20:13] I've seen him raise the dead.
[20:16] I've seen him form an eyeball right in
[20:18] front of me. I've seen him take bones
[20:20] that were broken that you could see
[20:22] where they're puncturing the skin and we
[20:25] laid hands gathered around said,
[20:26] "Father,
[20:28] this is your we need you, Lord. We put
[20:30] it in your hands and we we get through
[20:32] praying that arm straight."
[20:36] This should be an everyday thing.
[20:39] He's already done it for us, but
[20:41] somebody's got to enforce it.
[20:43] Somebody's got to stand up with courage
[20:45] and say, "My God."
[20:47] Amen.
[20:48] Hallelujah.
[20:49] Amen.
[20:50] Hallelujah.
[20:52] He says, "You're taking him out yonder
[20:54] to death. Reclaim him. Bring him back."
[20:57] He says, "Now that's enforcement.
[21:00] Restore it back to its original
[21:01] condition again.
[21:03] A man's sick, a baby's sick, a woman's
[21:05] sick. See, they're out of their natural
[21:07] condition. Then we have a right to
[21:10] enforce our claim." And then he says,
[21:12] "It's not our claim. It's our claim
[21:15] because God gave it to us." Amen.
[21:18] Amen.
[21:19] It It's your claim now, but you're just
[21:21] repeating what he already said.
[21:23] You ate a book and now you're
[21:25] prophesying again.
[21:26] Hallelujah.
[21:27] You ate the word and now the word is
[21:29] speaking to you.
[21:31] Hallelujah.
[21:32] He says, "Now that's enforcement.
[21:34] Restore it back. By his stripes, we were
[21:37] healed.
[21:39] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[21:42] With his stripes, we were healed.
[21:46] He says, "Now we have a right to enforce
[21:48] that law. The lawgiver, the Holy Spirit
[21:52] himself is here, the angel of God, the
[21:55] agent of God to see that it's done that
[21:57] way." Amen. Now, the only way he can
[22:00] work is when you let him work.
[22:03] But you've got to believe it.
[22:07] You know, he gave us the easiest part in
[22:09] all this. His part, our part is only
[22:12] believe.
[22:15] But we want to do everything else. Well,
[22:16] how am I going to make this happen? That
[22:18] looks impossible. And how, you know,
[22:19] I've done this and the devil said that.
[22:21] That ain't your job.
[22:24] He's already done that.
[22:26] He's already paid the price.
[22:28] He's already made you righteous. He's
[22:30] already justified you.
[22:32] He's done the work.
[22:34] But it's your job to confess it.
[22:38] Be it unto me according to what you've
[22:39] already said, Lord.
[22:40] Amen.
[22:42] Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:44] Blessed be his wonderful name. So the
[22:46] first step is to recognize what rights
[22:48] that you have as a citizen of this new
[22:51] kingdom.
[22:52] Amen.
[22:52] The kingdom of heaven. You know, as
[22:54] Americans, we we have certain rights. As
[22:56] Americans, people come from other
[22:58] countries and they they tell us, you
[22:59] know, you guys don't know what you have.
[23:01] You guys go around, you just take things
[23:03] for granted. We die for this opportunity
[23:06] back home. And you guys are going
[23:08] around, well, there ain't no work and
[23:09] there ain't no this and there ain't no
[23:10] that. and they'll come over here and
[23:12] show us how it's done.
[23:14] They'll take some crummy job and the
[23:16] next thing you know they're you're
[23:17] working for them.
[23:19] They see the opportunity. We
[23:23] What about us as believers this morning?
[23:26] What has he done for us?
[23:28] What is it that belongs to us? What has
[23:30] he purchased for us?
[23:32] Hallelujah. I don't want one thing that
[23:33] he's bought for me to go, you know, I I
[23:36] I would hate for one drop of his blood
[23:38] to be shed and then me not take
[23:40] advantage of what it purchased for me.
[23:43] Hallelujah.
[23:44] Amen.
[23:44] So, you need to get out of your mind
[23:46] here this morning whether you think that
[23:48] you deserve it or not
[23:51] or whether you're worthy or not.
[23:53] Let's just get over that.
[23:54] Let's just get past it.
[23:56] First of all, you don't deserve it.
[23:58] Second of all, you're not worthy.
[24:00] So, quit fighting that battle. Amen.
[24:02] Just look the devil in the face and say,
[24:04] "You're right, devil.
[24:06] I'm not worthy. What's your point?"
[24:08] But there's one that was declared
[24:10] worthy.
[24:11] And my confession this morning is worthy
[24:14] is the lamb.
[24:16] Hallelujah.
[24:18] But no, we we'll fight the battle on the
[24:20] wrong ground. Oh, if I could just be
[24:22] good enough, you can't.
[24:25] That's true.
[24:26] Hallelujah. So, we need to settle those
[24:28] questions once and for all. Amen.
[24:30] Because those questions are not even
[24:32] relevant.
[24:33] Amen.
[24:33] We didn't write the story.
[24:35] You won't find it anywhere in these
[24:37] claims. Well, if you're good enough, if
[24:39] you're worthy, if you, you know, say
[24:41] catechism or, you know, if you could
[24:44] stay uh, you know, not think a bad
[24:46] thought for a week,
[24:48] none of that's in there.
[24:49] He's purchased it for us.
[24:52] Amen.
[24:53] I might preach this morning.
[24:56] Hallelujah.
[24:58] Blessed be his wonderful name.
[25:00] Hallelujah.
[25:00] So the first citizen in this new kingdom
[25:03] is none other than the first of the God
[25:06] race himself.
[25:07] Amen.
[25:08] Amen.
[25:08] Amen.
[25:09] Your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[25:11] He's the first among many brethren.
[25:14] Amen.
[25:14] Hallelujah. There's an So if he's the
[25:16] first among many uh if he's the
[25:19] firstborn, that means there's a second
[25:21] born, a third born,
[25:22] and here in the end a last born. Amen.
[25:26] Amen.
[25:27] And he said, "What what what belongs to
[25:28] me and what I purchased, it belongs to
[25:30] you."
[25:31] What I've claimed is now your claim.
[25:34] But you've got to make the claim.
[25:37] Somebody's got to stand and declare this
[25:39] is reality.
[25:40] Amen.
[25:41] Somebody's got to be that standard
[25:44] that's on display in this hour. And
[25:46] that's why you've been placed here. You
[25:47] know, instead of us looking at, oh, it's
[25:49] so dark and it's so evil and look at all
[25:51] that's coming around us. Recognize,
[25:53] friends, you're the light.
[25:56] You are the testimony and you're the
[25:58] proof that there is a living God.
[26:01] You are God's answer to Satan's
[26:03] challenge in this hour.
[26:05] And God cannot fail.
[26:08] He doesn't have an an army of defeated
[26:12] defeated soldiers. His army is an
[26:14] overcoming army.
[26:16] Amen.
[26:17] Blessed be his wonderful name.
[26:20] So he told us that he himself came to
[26:22] destroy the works of the devil.
[26:24] Then he said, "The works that I do shall
[26:26] you do also."
[26:27] Is that right?
[26:28] And and you know there's an amazing
[26:29] thing. It doesn't make sense to the
[26:31] natural mind, but there's an amazing
[26:33] thing that he actually through his
[26:35] death, he came to destroy him who held
[26:39] the power of death, even the devil. So
[26:42] somehow through death, he defeated
[26:44] death.
[26:45] You know, to the natural mind, it's
[26:46] like, well, how is death going to defeat
[26:48] death? But he defeated death through his
[26:51] death
[26:52] because he took all the death
[26:56] that was coming our way
[26:59] and and past, present, and future. He
[27:01] absorbed all that death himself, paid
[27:04] the price
[27:05] so that even death is settled this
[27:07] morning.
[27:10] I don't I don't I don't think that's
[27:11] really breaking through to us, friends.
[27:13] I think that we still wonder about that.
[27:15] Well, then why are people still dying?
[27:16] We'll get into that here in just a
[27:18] moment. He conquered death at the cross.
[27:21] But the scripture tells us very plainly,
[27:24] he does not put it under his feet until
[27:27] the end of the last age
[27:30] on purpose.
[27:31] Not because the church was weak.
[27:34] Amen.
[27:35] Because death was the only vehicle that
[27:38] he had for bringing his children home.
[27:41] Hallelujah.
[27:42] Well, why do you have to bring them
[27:44] home? Because if Paul was still here,
[27:45] I'd be living off of his revelation.
[27:48] Yeah.
[27:48] Every time I needed something, I'd say,
[27:50] "Paul, Paul, would you pray for me?"
[27:52] But God has, he doesn't have
[27:54] grandchildren. He has children.
[27:56] So, in every age, each one of us had to
[27:58] come forth.
[27:59] Paul, you know, I I used to just weep.
[28:02] And I just I was so tore up because I
[28:05] realized that the first church was
[28:06] rapture ready.
[28:07] The first church was standing right
[28:09] there looking through the door. Paul
[28:11] preached, "We are alive and remain, not
[28:13] those in the future, us."
[28:14] Amen. We which are alive and remain unto
[28:16] the coming of the Lord.
[28:18] Amen.
[28:19] Amen.
[28:20] We're going to be changed in a moment in
[28:22] the twinkling of eye.
[28:23] He preached serpent seed. He preached
[28:25] oneness of the godhead. He original sin.
[28:28] He preached it all, friends. And they're
[28:30] standing right there.
[28:32] But then he had to go into the ground.
[28:35] And it just he would I would meditate on
[28:36] that. It would tear me up. I thought,
[28:38] "Oh my my brother Paul, you went into
[28:40] the ground because of me." Yeah,
[28:43] because God had more thoughts than Paul.
[28:46] God knew that he had more seed. Jesus
[28:48] said, "I'll build my church over seven
[28:50] church ages." He didn't let them know
[28:53] just how long it would be. But he said,
[28:54] "I'm going to build a church and the
[28:56] gates of hell will not prevail against
[28:57] it." I've got more thoughts than Paul.
[29:00] Paul's one of my thoughts, but he's at
[29:02] the feet. I've got more thoughts
[29:04] all the way through clear up to the
[29:05] head.
[29:06] Amen.
[29:07] Is that right? Amen.
[29:08] So I I was thinking, brother brother
[29:10] Brooks, I was thinking, you know, when I
[29:12] get there, of course, the very first one
[29:14] I want to see is my Lord.
[29:16] Amen.
[29:17] Amen.
[29:17] But I want to shake Paul's hand.
[29:19] Amen.
[29:19] And I want to hug his neck.
[29:21] Amen.
[29:21] And kiss him. And I want to say,
[29:23] "Brother Paul, I'm so sorry that you had
[29:25] to go into the ground
[29:26] because you are rapture ready."
[29:28] Amen.
[29:29] There was nothing held back.
[29:31] You were rapture ready. Amen.
[29:33] But God did not reveal uh uh this last
[29:36] secret
[29:37] because you would have been raptured.
[29:39] You'd have caught it and that would have
[29:40] been the end of it.
[29:42] But I hadn't come yet.
[29:44] There was more seed.
[29:48] So God conquered death,
[29:50] but death has no power over you. Death
[29:52] is an escort.
[29:54] Amen.
[29:54] There's quotes for that, friends. It
[29:56] escorts you over to the other side.
[29:58] Amen.
[29:58] And you don't go to hell.
[30:00] Amen. Hallelujah.
[30:01] You go to a wonderful place.
[30:03] Amen.
[30:05] So death, death right now is working on
[30:08] our behalf.
[30:09] Because everyone that went down thinking
[30:11] that they were going in the rapture in
[30:14] their day, they're coming up with that
[30:15] same expectation.
[30:17] Hallelujah.
[30:18] Hallelujah.
[30:19] They weren't thinking, oh, you know,
[30:20] Paul wasn't thinking, well, there's
[30:21] something left that has to be preached.
[30:23] And and they weren't thinking, well,
[30:25] Paul's got to come back because he
[30:26] didn't finish his ministry.
[30:28] No, he did. He sounded
[30:30] friends in every age they sounded.
[30:33] This message sounded.
[30:36] Don't put it. Your your expectation
[30:38] should not be for something in the
[30:39] future.
[30:40] If the Lord's coming now, you're ready.
[30:44] If he takes you home tonight and the
[30:46] rapture occurs a week from now, oh,
[30:48] Brother Baker, wasn't that wrong for me
[30:50] to believe that I was living in that
[30:52] time? No. You had the right expectation.
[30:55] And you'll come up with the same
[30:56] expectation that you went down with.
[30:58] Amen.
[30:59] Hallelujah.
[31:00] But I just personally have the
[31:02] revelation this morning. I ain't going
[31:03] down.
[31:05] Why? Because there's no one for me to
[31:07] hand the baton off to.
[31:09] We're at the end of the race.
[31:11] We've been specially trained in this
[31:13] hour, in this age. We haven't been
[31:15] trained, Brother Brooks. I haven't been
[31:17] taught how to hand it off.
[31:20] I wasn't trained and schooled in that. I
[31:22] don't know how to hand it off. My job is
[31:24] to go across the finish line.
[31:27] And right now, the saints are gathered
[31:29] in this building all around looking over
[31:31] the banister saying, "Keep going."
[31:34] Keep going.
[31:36] Amen.
[31:37] So, I want to hug Paul's neck and I want
[31:39] to I want to cry and say, "I'm so sorry,
[31:41] my brother, that you had to go on the
[31:43] ground, but you did it for me."
[31:45] And brother Paul's going to say, "Weep
[31:47] not, my brother. You return the favor
[31:50] because if you hadn't been standing here
[31:53] on the earth when the title deed came
[31:55] back into our hands
[31:59] if you hadn't have been the one the feet
[32:01] on the body
[32:03] that finally put death under your feet
[32:08] we couldn't come back.
[32:12] Oh friends, we got the picture wrong.
[32:14] We think, "Oh, if I could just get over
[32:16] there, what a wonderful thing." They
[32:17] want here more than you want there.
[32:20] Because that's not our home.
[32:22] This is our home.
[32:25] But they can't come because there's been
[32:27] a dispute over the chemicals that make
[32:29] up their body.
[32:30] Satan has had claims, but the claiming
[32:33] work is being done in this hour.
[32:35] And the title deed is coming back into
[32:36] the hands of sons and daughters of God
[32:38] in this hour.
[32:39] Amen.
[32:39] And with that in our hands, we can say
[32:42] these elements, I claim them. Amen.
[32:44] These elements have been claimed by my
[32:46] Lord and Savior.
[32:49] The book has been opened. The worthy one
[32:50] has been found.
[32:53] And he is he has said, "I find no fault
[32:56] in you."
[32:57] You never done it to begin with.
[33:02] Come stand by my side.
[33:06] Oh, hallelujah, friends.
[33:09] Blessed be his wonderful name.
[33:11] Hallelujah.
[33:13] Hallelujah.
[33:14] Blessed be his name.
[33:18] So he conquered death at the cross. It's
[33:20] settled.
[33:21] Don't you get Well, it kind of he kind
[33:24] of sort of and maybe there's something
[33:25] left for him to do. It's done. The
[33:27] scripture tells us that.
[33:29] Death has been conquered.
[33:30] But it hasn't been brought under his
[33:33] feet yet.
[33:36] There's a body on the earth right now.
[33:38] It's his body.
[33:39] It's a many membered body. Is that
[33:41] right? So you say, "Well, I I ain't
[33:44] nothing. I'm just the skin on the bottom
[33:45] of the toe." Well, guess where you're If
[33:48] you're the skin on the bottom of the
[33:49] toe, guess where that foot's at?
[33:52] It's on the head of the devil.
[33:57] You know, Brother Brandon was given that
[33:58] vision about uh uh uh you know, this
[34:02] this man was was uh being bit by a or
[34:05] there's a black mama snake that was
[34:07] threatening him, right? And the snake
[34:09] represents death,
[34:11] sin, unbelief. And he and he was saying,
[34:14] "Why is everybody afraid in these kind
[34:15] of times?" And this man was afraid
[34:17] that's that that mamba was coming at
[34:20] him. And the thing that was significant
[34:21] about a mamba is that you get bit by
[34:23] that, you start to paralyze.
[34:25] You know, unless you got the antivenenom
[34:27] handy, which they don't,
[34:29] but unless you got it handy, you just
[34:31] got a limited amount of time and you're
[34:32] done.
[34:33] So people know it's certain death,
[34:36] right? Amen.
[34:37] And so everybody's afraid of death. And
[34:39] the Lord spoke to him and said, "How
[34:41] would you like to bind that?"
[34:43] Hallelujah.
[34:43] He said, "Oh, would I
[34:45] wanted that my that's what I wanted my
[34:47] whole life."
[34:48] Amen. And he said when he bound it, he
[34:50] said, "Speak to it." And it turned into
[34:52] like glass. And he said, "It formed an
[34:54] sign."
[34:55] And it this, you know, forgive me, I'm a
[34:57] slow learner, okay? But it didn't hit me
[34:59] here until just a few days ago or a few
[35:01] weeks ago what the significance of the
[35:03] and sign was. Even though he'd said the
[35:05] words, he said, "You bind this and
[35:06] everything under it is bound."
[35:08] Amen.
[35:09] Death is the last enemy.
[35:12] Is that right? The last one. You bind
[35:14] that. The I don't care if it's cancer. I
[35:16] don't care uh if it's lust, pornography,
[35:19] I don't care what it is. You bind death.
[35:21] Everything else
[35:23] is bound.
[35:25] The manifestation of the sons of God
[35:27] with a book in their hand with rights.
[35:29] Amen.
[35:29] That are claiming this earth.
[35:31] Amen.
[35:32] Hallelujah. Amen.
[35:34] So he bound it and it was bound. He
[35:36] said, "You can loose it too." And he
[35:37] loosed it. And then he bound it back
[35:38] again.
[35:39] Yeah.
[35:39] And then he said, "Lord, what must I
[35:41] do?" And the Lord took him to, excuse
[35:42] me, into into Corinthians. And and uh he
[35:45] came across that scripture that says uh
[35:47] uh uh that uh about when you come to
[35:50] this feast, which is where we're at.
[35:53] This is just before the opening of the
[35:54] word. Amen.
[35:55] When you come to this feast, uh, let it
[35:57] not be with un with leavenvening the
[35:59] leavenvening and, you know, malice and
[36:01] and strife and all these different
[36:03] things,
[36:04] but let it be the, you know, with
[36:05] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[36:08] And he's told, you must be more sincere.
[36:11] I was sharing with brother Brooks Brooks
[36:12] that, you know, the first time I read
[36:15] that for many times, for many years
[36:16] after that, I thought, you know, I just
[36:18] want to be as sincere as he was when he
[36:19] was told he needed to be more sincere.
[36:21] Yeah.
[36:22] Now, notice, he wasn't being told, you
[36:24] aren't sincere. He wasn't being told,
[36:27] you know, you're uh you're not living
[36:29] right. He was just being told, you need
[36:30] to take it up a notch.
[36:31] Amen.
[36:32] You need to be more sincere because
[36:34] we're just about to come into the
[36:35] opening of the word.
[36:37] And to go into the opening word, you
[36:38] can't take those that unbelief into
[36:41] there.
[36:42] Amen.
[36:43] Amen.
[36:43] Oh, friends, we're living in the in the
[36:45] last age where we've been called to
[36:47] repent. Amen.
[36:48] There's no other age where that's that's
[36:50] told, "Be zealous, therefore, and
[36:52] repent."
[36:54] That means to do it with enthusiasm.
[36:56] Do it with zeal. That means that when
[36:58] conviction comes across, you're not
[36:59] feeling condemned. When it comes across,
[37:01] oh Lord, thank you for showing me that.
[37:03] Cuz if you hadn't have shown me, I'd
[37:05] have just kept on walking in ignorance.
[37:07] You're not showing that to beat me down.
[37:09] You're showing me that so I can repent
[37:12] zealously.
[37:14] Friends, we are repenting of the
[37:15] unbelief of all the ages.
[37:18] I have someone against thee in each age.
[37:20] Well, that all had that title search had
[37:22] to be conducted and that all had to be
[37:24] washed off.
[37:27] Hallelujah.
[37:28] We were sent a prophet here in the last
[37:29] age
[37:30] and the son of man came to reveal
[37:32] himself
[37:33] and we the word came to the prophet in
[37:36] the water
[37:38] but then the word was washed by the
[37:40] water of the word. Amen.
[37:43] Amen.
[37:44] The actually what's what's happened was
[37:46] the bride came to him in the water.
[37:49] Amen.
[37:50] In a bride coming, that bride is being
[37:52] washed
[37:53] by the water of the word by the it's not
[37:56] a partial word now. It's the full word.
[37:58] And every lean that was against the
[38:00] church for the last 2,000 years is being
[38:03] washed off.
[38:05] And a a declaration is being made. You
[38:07] never done it to begin with.
[38:11] You ain't forgiven. You never done it.
[38:15] [Music]
[38:18] I hope to get back to that thought here
[38:19] in a moment because it it's something
[38:21] that's got a break on us, friends.
[38:23] It's something that we got to get a we
[38:24] got to get a hold of, not with our mind,
[38:26] but in our heart.
[38:27] In fact, I'm preaching soul food here
[38:29] this morning.
[38:30] You say, "I don't like soul food." Well,
[38:32] you better start liking it
[38:33] cuz you know, you you can come here on a
[38:35] Wednesday night. We have a midweek
[38:37] service. You can come and you can think,
[38:38] man, I I probably won't get nothing out
[38:40] of the service. You know, I've had such
[38:42] a hard time and I went through such a
[38:43] battle and and and and the devil will be
[38:46] telling you, "Well, you might as well
[38:46] not even go. You aren't going to get
[38:48] anything out of it." And right, but
[38:50] somehow you drag your carcass in here.
[38:52] You sit down and you might have a
[38:54] service where you don't say nothing. You
[38:56] might have a service there where you
[38:57] think, "Well, I don't even know if I'm
[38:58] getting anything out of it or not." You
[39:00] need to get that thought away from you
[39:02] because what's happening is the the man
[39:05] of God is ministering to your soul
[39:09] and your soul doesn't have emotions
[39:11] or feelings.
[39:12] Your soul believes or it doubts.
[39:15] In your soul, your soul is being fed and
[39:17] you're being built up
[39:22] Hallelujah.
[39:24] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[39:25] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[39:28] Oh my I I'm in the right place this
[39:31] morning.
[39:36] So he tells us the works that I do shall
[39:38] you do also. How many believes that?
[39:40] Amen.
[39:41] He did the works of his father who sent
[39:44] him. And then he says, I'll do these
[39:47] very same works again in you
[39:50] that my father might be glorified again.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:54] How many believes that?
[39:54] Amen. So, we need to fully recognize
[39:57] that all of the claims that were made
[39:59] 2,000 years ago are of no consequence
[40:02] unless there are those on the earth that
[40:05] will enforce those claims.
[40:08] There has to be someone standing here
[40:09] saying, "That ain't nothing but the
[40:11] truth."
[40:11] Amen.
[40:12] Be it unto me,
[40:15] not let me try to figure out how to make
[40:16] this work.
[40:18] That's where we get into trouble.
[40:19] And that's where we get depressed.
[40:21] And that's where we get, you know, get
[40:22] the devil beating us down. Well, you
[40:24] said this and you said that. I know. I
[40:25] know. I know. You said you were going to
[40:27] try this and weren't going to do that. I
[40:29] know. I know. I know. Well, quit trying
[40:31] to do it.
[40:32] Let Let He He's already done it.
[40:35] Start confessing it.
[40:39] That will become your reality and you'll
[40:41] walk in it.
[40:43] I'm an overcomer this morning.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:46] You say, "Well, didn't you have to
[40:47] apologize to your wife?" I might have
[40:49] had to apologize to my wife and I might
[40:51] have to apologize again before this
[40:52] body's changed,
[40:53] but I'm already an overcomer.
[40:57] That's what the word has already
[40:58] declared about me and I'm lining my
[41:00] confession up with what he said and
[41:03] that's my reality.
[41:05] You say, "But but it looks like there's
[41:07] so far to go. I don't care.
[41:11] Don't you believe in the supernatural?"
[41:13] Well, you're a special case. That means
[41:15] God's going to be greater in my life.
[41:17] Hallelujah.
[41:18] That means if he can do it in my life,
[41:20] he can do it in anybody's life.
[41:23] My God's not a loser, he's a winner.
[41:27] Hallelujah.
[41:30] So, we might, you know, think about
[41:32] this. Now, I'm not trying to be
[41:33] disrespectful and we want to take
[41:34] everything in its right place and
[41:35] there's no way to bring a perfect
[41:36] balance in every every message that you
[41:38] bring, but we might get excited about
[41:40] the thought of a visitation of an angel,
[41:42] right? And nothing against that, right?
[41:45] We would get excited about it, right?
[41:47] But who has more authority here on the
[41:49] earth? An angel or a son or daughter of
[41:51] God?
[41:52] That's that's the problem. We got an
[41:54] identity crisis here.
[41:55] Well, if there was just an angel here to
[41:56] help me, that angel has already come.
[41:59] And there are still angels, ministering
[42:01] angels, but you're the point.
[42:03] You're the one that's got to come to a
[42:05] position.
[42:07] Yes, sir.
[42:08] Hallelujah.
[42:08] When brother books cries out to the
[42:10] Lord, the Lord, he might be speaking to
[42:12] Michael. He might be speaking to to uh
[42:15] uh uh Gabriel. He might be speaking to
[42:17] Wormwood and he'll he'll say, "Wormwood,
[42:19] you know, I've got an important uh uh
[42:21] thing that I've got I want you to do and
[42:23] and I'm sitting you down and this is so
[42:25] important." And then I'll said,
[42:28] he looks over, there's a hotline there.
[42:30] Excuse me, Wormwood.
[42:32] Picks up the phone. It's my son.
[42:35] Hallelujah.
[42:37] Amen. You grandmothers, you mothers, you
[42:39] know how that is. You might have your
[42:40] best friend over at the house.
[42:42] Amen. But the phone rings and you find
[42:45] out it's my son.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:46] It's my daughter.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:48] I got to take this call.
[42:51] I don't care what you're going through.
[42:52] You want to take that call.
[42:54] God could be given given orders to the
[42:58] most important angel.
[42:59] But when you call, he's ready to hear
[43:01] your call.
[43:05] Blessed be his wonderful name. You have
[43:07] more authority here than an angel
[43:10] because this is your realm
[43:12] that you are being restored back to.
[43:16] Hallelujah.
[43:18] Okay, let's get to let's get back to
[43:20] Psalm 27, the the rapture psalm here for
[43:23] a moment. Psalm 27:1, a psalm of David.
[43:28] The Lord is my light.
[43:31] How many can say he's your light this
[43:33] morning
[43:34] and my salvation?
[43:36] Whom shall I fear?
[43:40] Look at the boldness of this man under
[43:42] the blood of bulls and goats. Actually,
[43:44] friends, he's prophesying here.
[43:46] I hope before we get through here, I
[43:47] hope that you realize, you know, the
[43:49] scripture says the prophet of God tells
[43:51] us that that David was a man after God's
[43:53] own heart.
[43:54] Well, what does that represent?
[43:57] Who who is who is the one after God's
[44:00] own heart?
[44:02] as brothers here this morning. Those of
[44:04] you that are married, I'm giving you a
[44:05] little hint here. Those of you that are
[44:07] married, who's the one that's after your
[44:08] own heart,
[44:10] the very heart of God is his bride.
[44:13] She came out of his heart.
[44:15] She's the very expression
[44:18] of the feeling part.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:22] So, David represents you and I.
[44:24] Amen.
[44:25] He's a man after God's own heart. He's
[44:27] representing you and I this morning. He
[44:30] wanted to do what's right, but he
[44:32] couldn't do it.
[44:33] So, he thought, you know, if I could
[44:34] just put the commandments on the
[44:35] doorpost, if I could just, you know,
[44:36] wear that flactory on my forehead, if I
[44:38] could just, you know, have it everywhere
[44:40] I go, scriptures all over the place to
[44:43] remind me,
[44:44] amen, then then I then I won't fall. But
[44:46] he was under the blood of bulls and
[44:47] goats. The blood hadn't been shed, but
[44:49] his desire,
[44:50] his desire was to serve. And somehow he
[44:52] was able to walk past all that and
[44:54] commit adultery.
[44:55] But he was a type of you and I. So he's
[44:58] prophesying here just as he prophesied
[44:59] to the bridegroom and said, "My bones,
[45:01] they stare at me." And that wasn't
[45:04] David. That was that was what was going
[45:05] to happen to the bridegroom.
[45:07] This is for the bride here this morning.
[45:09] Amen.
[45:10] When the wicked, even mine enemies, and
[45:13] you have enemies this morning,
[45:15] even and your enemies are not people,
[45:17] right?
[45:18] We battle not against flesh and blood,
[45:21] spirits, powers, principalities on high.
[45:24] high devils, mature devils, not little
[45:26] wimpy impy, mature ones.
[45:30] When the wicked, even mine enemies and
[45:33] my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh,
[45:37] they stumbled and they fell.
[45:39] What's that got to do with me? Well,
[45:41] what is eating your flesh right now?
[45:44] Sickness,
[45:45] disease, anxiety, cancer.
[45:49] They come to eat your flesh.
[45:51] The man was told, "Because of what you
[45:54] did, you're going to return to the
[45:55] dust." Then the serpent was told,
[45:57] "You're going to eat dust."
[45:58] What are demons living off of?
[46:02] They have a right until until we finally
[46:05] enforce the claim over death itself.
[46:08] When the last one comes in,
[46:10] Amen.
[46:11] They've got a right to come and and and
[46:13] and try to eat this flesh. But David
[46:16] said, "When they do that,
[46:19] when they come to eat up my flesh, they
[46:21] stumbled and they fell."
[46:24] Not even cancer can stand.
[46:28] Hallelujah.
[46:29] Though in host should encamp against me,
[46:32] I'm all alone. They're all around me.
[46:34] Yeah. And what's your point?
[46:36] Which army is greater?
[46:37] Amen.
[46:38] Whom shall you fear?
[46:40] Though a host shall encamp against me,
[46:43] and they are. There's 200 million demons
[46:45] that were released from the river
[46:47] Euphrates that drove natural Israel back
[46:49] into her homeland. Now they're driving
[46:51] spiritual Israel,
[46:53] the bride, into her homeland,
[46:55] which is the fullness of the word.
[46:57] Amen.
[46:58] Which is taking full possession of what
[47:00] belongs to us.
[47:02] Coming to the full stature.
[47:04] Hallelujah.
[47:06] Though in host should encamp against me,
[47:08] my heart shall not fear.
[47:10] Amen.
[47:12] Now, I want you to notice these words
[47:13] are very specific. He didn't say, "My my
[47:16] brain won't fear."
[47:18] Oh, come on, friends. Help me out this
[47:19] morning.
[47:20] We got to know the difference.
[47:22] Because if you try to fight the battle
[47:23] based on this outer guy,
[47:25] you know, I I've been, Brother Brooks,
[47:27] I'm trying to be patient. I'm trying to
[47:29] be loving and as best I can, but where
[47:32] the Lord has placed me, I've been trying
[47:34] to show the people what the Lord has
[47:36] shown us and what he's done for us in
[47:37] this age. that when we say that we're
[47:40] without sin, we ain't talking about the
[47:42] carcass.
[47:44] Amen.
[47:45] But I guess if you haven't been born
[47:46] again, it don't make sense,
[47:49] right?
[47:50] Well, I'm just a, you know, we we'll
[47:53] hear this and it sounds so religious and
[47:54] it sounds so good, but it's a lie from
[47:56] the pits of hell. It's unbelief that we
[47:58] need to repent from in this hour.
[48:00] Well, I'm just a sinner saved by grace.
[48:03] You ever heard that?
[48:04] You said it yourself.
[48:06] Stop. You were a sinner
[48:09] that was saved by grace
[48:11] and now you're no longer a sinner.
[48:17] First John
[48:19] chapter 3.
[48:22] Amen. Those that are born of God do not
[48:24] commit sin.
[48:27] Amen.
[48:27] Hallelujah.
[48:28] Oh, but brother Doug, it says in John 1
[48:30] John 1:1 that he that the one that says
[48:33] he's without sin, he's a liar, right?
[48:36] Well, yeah, that's before you repented.
[48:38] Amen.
[48:39] Amen.
[48:40] Which guy is he talking to?
[48:41] Amen.
[48:43] The outer man or the inner man.
[48:45] Yeah. You got to recognize that you're a
[48:47] sinner. That you need salvation.
[48:48] Amen.
[48:50] Ruth had to recognize
[48:52] that that she had nothing coming.
[48:55] She's, you know, she lucked out somehow
[48:57] to be with her mother-in-law Naomi. and
[48:59] she's in a, you know, in a land of of of
[49:02] people that are having sex with their
[49:04] own family,
[49:05] right? That can't go back into the
[49:07] temple for 10 generations.
[49:09] She has no chance, no hope.
[49:11] But she's lucky because in this time of
[49:13] famine, when this this woman goes
[49:15] through, she loses her husband, then she
[49:17] loses her sons and and and and this Ruth
[49:20] loses her husband,
[49:22] but she's lucky that this Old Testament
[49:23] is still word is still there for her.
[49:26] And she's she's like, "Well, you know,
[49:28] I'm just glad to be saved.
[49:30] I don't have anything coming. I'm a
[49:31] Moabitete.
[49:33] I'm not an Israelite. I'm a Moabitete.
[49:35] I'm a Gentile dog. I have nothing
[49:36] coming. I'm just a sinner saved by
[49:38] grace."
[49:39] Right? I don't have time to get into
[49:41] friends. We We could spend we could
[49:42] bring a series on this.
[49:44] But let's just fast forward, okay? She
[49:46] goes from I'm just a sinner saved by
[49:48] grace to going back to the land.
[49:50] Amen.
[49:50] And then she goes to finding out uh you
[49:52] need to be in a certain field.
[49:54] Yeah. because the Lord of the harvest uh
[49:57] uh uh is is going to pay buy you back
[50:00] and pay for your inheritance.
[50:02] And and so she ends up working her way.
[50:04] So justification was was uh uh you know
[50:07] Orpha gave Orpha gave Naomi a kiss,
[50:11] a Judas kiss.
[50:12] Amen. But Ruth said, "Will your people
[50:14] be my people? I don't know what I'm
[50:16] getting myself into, but you know, I I
[50:19] didn't have I didn't have anything
[50:20] coming. I'm just glad to be still
[50:21] alive." And
[50:22] Right. Amen.
[50:24] Saved somehow.
[50:26] But not deserving it.
[50:28] I'm just a sinner saved by grace. I'm
[50:29] just a Moabitete saved by grace.
[50:32] But the next thing you know, she's being
[50:33] told about, well, you know, we got a
[50:34] kinsman and she's being schooled and
[50:37] trained in the law of the near kinsman.
[50:39] And she just happens to look out.
[50:41] Yeah.
[50:42] And end up in Boaz's field. The only one
[50:44] that can redeem her.
[50:48] And now she's got to work her way
[50:50] through her stage of legalism. Yeah,
[50:52] she's she's working and working and
[50:54] she's she's uh gleaning there in the
[50:56] field
[50:57] and then Boaz sees her.
[51:00] She gets the attention of Boaz. He comes
[51:02] out. He's looking over his fields.
[51:04] Amen. And he sees her and said, "Who is
[51:06] this woman?"
[51:10] When he comes and talks to her, he tells
[51:12] her about her good character. She's
[51:15] working through sanctification,
[51:17] working her way through legalism. He
[51:19] says, "You've conducted yourself well.
[51:21] You've got my attention,
[51:23] right? And then he goes on and and and
[51:25] and finally he looks at the ministers
[51:27] and he says, you know what? Oh,
[51:29] hallelujah, friends.
[51:30] I love it. I love it.
[51:33] She ended up in his field.
[51:35] You know, there was a there was a man
[51:37] that found a treasure that was buried in
[51:39] a field one time. One of the seven
[51:41] parables in Matthew chapter 13, he found
[51:44] a a a treasure that was hidden in the
[51:46] field. Uh it it had been there, but it
[51:48] was hidden from everybody. But he
[51:50] stumbled across it. He found it. Amen.
[51:52] Amen.
[51:53] And he got so excited when he saw it and
[51:55] he looked around to see if anybody else
[51:56] saw it.
[51:57] And then what he did, he did a very
[51:59] strange thing. He went and rearied it in
[52:01] the very same field that he found it in.
[52:03] Oh, I hope somebody's listening this
[52:05] morning.
[52:06] And then he went home and he counted the
[52:08] cost. He thought, I got to have that
[52:10] field.
[52:12] You say, "Well, why didn't he just take
[52:13] that home?" Well, first of all, it would
[52:14] have been stealing. Second of all, it
[52:16] would have broke every type. Amen.
[52:18] He found it in the field.
[52:20] Amen. It was of no value to anybody
[52:21] else. They probably walked by it all the
[52:23] time.
[52:24] Amen. So he went home. He sold
[52:25] everything that he had
[52:27] and brought the price of that to buy the
[52:29] field.
[52:30] He didn't think, well, let me see what
[52:31] kind of deal I can get on it. How, you
[52:33] know, I'll just give up this and that.
[52:35] You got to give it all up.
[52:36] Amen.
[52:37] You know, I'll just I'll just I'll just
[52:38] smoke half a pack of cigarettes. You got
[52:40] to quit.
[52:40] Amen.
[52:41] You got to give it all up.
[52:43] Not hold on to anything.
[52:45] Amen.
[52:46] So, so he comes and and asks what the
[52:51] asking price is and he's told just, you
[52:54] know, as Abraham went to to buy the cave
[52:56] of Mpila
[52:58] to bury his bride and he owned the whole
[53:00] land.
[53:01] It was all his. It was his possession,
[53:02] but he had no place to bury his wife.
[53:05] So, he wanted to buy that specific
[53:07] field, that specific plot of land,
[53:10] the land of the resurrection.
[53:13] The land Oh, hallelujah. where the where
[53:16] the kinsman redeemer was going to come
[53:18] up from.
[53:21] Blessed be his wonderful name.
[53:22] You say, "Well, do I have to be buried
[53:24] over there?" No, you got to be buried in
[53:25] Christ.
[53:27] That's our land. You got to be buried in
[53:29] the fullness of the word, and that's
[53:30] where you're coming up.
[53:33] Hallelujah.
[53:34] He He didn't argue with Ephraim there in
[53:36] the Old Testament. He said, "How much do
[53:38] you want for it?" He says, "I'll give it
[53:39] to you." And he says, "No, you know, we
[53:40] know that won't work."
[53:42] Amen. I'm going to have to pay a price
[53:44] for this.
[53:45] you're not giving me nothing. And he
[53:47] knew the Hittite law. He knew that if he
[53:49] gave him that land that the uh it really
[53:51] wasn't his.
[53:52] And that after a generation or so, it
[53:54] would just go back into the and the
[53:55] Hittites didn't want them living in that
[53:57] land.
[53:58] But he said, "I want to buy it."
[54:00] And so he says, he looks at him and he
[54:02] says, uh, you know, he he named an
[54:05] exorbitant price, 50 shekels of silver,
[54:07] 40, whatever it was, an exorbitant
[54:09] price. And it was it was in weight, 400,
[54:12] I think it was. It was it was silver by
[54:15] weight. And he said, "That's how much."
[54:19] Thinking that Abraham was gonna blink.
[54:22] Abraham said, "Sold."
[54:24] Amen.
[54:24] Here it is.
[54:27] He bought that field.
[54:29] That's where That's where Abraham was
[54:31] buried. That's where Sarah was buried.
[54:32] That's where Isaac, Jacob, all the
[54:34] patriarchs, they believe Adam and Eve
[54:35] was buried there.
[54:36] That's where Joseph's bones were carried
[54:38] back to.
[54:40] Yes, sir.
[54:42] showed us a shadow, a type
[54:44] buying that.
[54:46] Amen. So, so here's Boaz. He He sees
[54:49] her. He sees Ruth in the field, a woman
[54:52] of, you know, he he's 80 years old.
[54:54] She's 40. He He could have married
[54:55] anybody, but he sees her. And he
[54:58] recognizes she's a treasure in his
[55:00] field.
[55:01] And so, the first thing he does is rear
[55:03] her in the same field. He says, "You
[55:05] stay in this field."
[55:07] Don't you go anywhere else. Amen.
[55:10] And she and he tells his ministers, he
[55:12] said, "Don't you don't you put your seed
[55:14] in her."
[55:15] Amen.
[55:15] Don't you inject your own ideas.
[55:18] What I want you to do is intentionally
[55:19] drop little handfuls.
[55:23] When she's when she's down, I want you
[55:25] to preach spiritual food and due season.
[55:28] When she needs encouragement, I I I need
[55:30] you to preach the mighty God unveiled.
[55:33] Hallelujah.
[55:34] Don't you manhandle her. I'm going to
[55:36] hold you responsible.
[55:38] Oh, blessed be his wonderful name.
[55:42] But friends, something happens in
[55:44] Roose's walk. Something happens in her
[55:46] revelation. She finally gets to the
[55:48] point where she goes at the threshing
[55:50] time, in the evening time, at the end of
[55:54] the day, and she finds herself laying at
[55:57] Boaz's feet.
[55:59] And everybody thinks she's crazy. Oh,
[56:01] you're calling yourself bride. These
[56:02] women, there were other gleaners out
[56:04] there in the field. What makes you think
[56:06] you're special? Him. Amen.
[56:10] Her revelation goes from I'm just a
[56:12] sinner saved by grace to that's my
[56:14] redeemer.
[56:16] [Music]
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:18] Not only is he my redeemer, I'm related
[56:21] to him.
[56:22] And he has to buy me.
[56:26] It's the law.
[56:29] So she goes before him with an attitude.
[56:32] She says, "Give me that book." I mean,
[56:34] she says,
[56:35] "Hallelujah." Amen.
[56:41] She says, "By me,"
[56:44] he said, "I will not rest this day until
[56:47] this third work of redemption, this
[56:49] claiming work is done."
[56:50] Amen.
[56:51] Until I claim back everything that
[56:53] belongs to you, but in the meantime, let
[56:55] me give you some let me load you up with
[56:58] more grain than you gleaned in all the
[57:00] fields.
[57:01] Now, you go and rest while I finish this
[57:03] work. Amen.
[57:05] Amen.
[57:06] She went back saying, "I'm the bride."
[57:08] Amen.
[57:09] This guy's not only related to me, he's
[57:11] he not only owns the cattle of the
[57:13] Thousand Hills. And I didn't get lucky
[57:15] to get in this field. I was led. My
[57:17] footsteps were ordained.
[57:19] [Applause]
[57:21] I had to end up in this place.
[57:23] Just as Abraham had in his three-stage
[57:26] journey, friends.
[57:28] Oh, he goes to Sheikum. goes to Bethl
[57:30] and then he ends up here in that last
[57:32] place
[57:33] where he's where there's a union taking
[57:35] place between him and the Lord.
[57:37] Amen.
[57:37] Blessed be his wonderful name. She was
[57:39] in the third stage of her journey.
[57:41] And and and her confession was no longer
[57:44] well, you know, this is what the pastor
[57:46] says or brother Brandham says. This was
[57:48] See, she'd been schooled by the word.
[57:50] Naomi, the Old Testament been schooled
[57:52] in the in the laws of the kinsman
[57:54] redeemer.
[57:55] Amen.
[57:55] Amen. And the leverant law.
[57:57] She'd been schooled in this. And now
[57:59] she's standing there saying, "You got to
[58:01] do this." Now, friends, you got to have
[58:02] a revelation to do that,
[58:04] right? You got to you can't be, "Well,
[58:06] you know, I understand. You know, I'm
[58:08] not worthy. You know, if I lay down at
[58:10] your feet and what if he turns me away?"
[58:13] You know, what if he looks at me and
[58:15] says, "Well, you haven't been good
[58:16] enough today. What if he knows what I
[58:18] did last week?"
[58:20] Amen.
[58:20] Amen.
[58:21] Had nothing to do with it.
[58:22] Amen.
[58:22] It had to do with everything to do with
[58:24] who she was. Amen.
[58:26] Who she really was, friends. And her
[58:28] desire was to do what was right.
[58:31] But her revelation had to actually come
[58:33] up to the place where she realized, you
[58:35] got to buy me.
[58:36] Amen.
[58:38] That's your part.
[58:39] You are my redeemer.
[58:43] You're not only worthy, you're not only
[58:45] able, but you want to.
[58:46] Amen.
[58:47] And you're going to redeem me. Oh
[58:50] friends,
[58:52] the reason why you're going to redeem me
[58:53] is because I came out of you.
[58:55] Hallelujah.
[58:57] I'm not just something that you felt
[58:59] sorry for.
[59:00] I was in you.
[59:01] Amen.
[59:01] As Adam, as Eve was in Adam's side,
[59:05] and she became the revelation of Adam.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:09] So was the bride in Christ's side
[59:11] and she's the revelation of Jesus
[59:14] Christ.
[59:15] The hidden part that's now revealed.
[59:17] Amen.
[59:18] But she's got to come to that place.
[59:20] She's got to come to that position, that
[59:22] recognition herself.
[59:24] Amen.
[59:24] You didn't you didn't save me because
[59:26] you felt sorry for me.
[59:27] You saved me because I'm your kin.
[59:31] I'm the reason you went to Calvary.
[59:34] I'm the reason you shed the blood.
[59:36] I'm the reason that you placed all these
[59:38] claims in the word.
[59:41] Amen.
[59:42] Amen. Friends, there was a time and
[59:44] rightfully so. There was a time when the
[59:46] message was God sent a prophet. There
[59:48] was a time for that. We needed to hear
[59:50] that.
[59:50] But then it needed to progress from God
[59:52] sent a prophet to why did he send a
[59:55] prophet?
[59:55] Amen.
[59:56] Well, he sent a prophet with a message.
[59:58] Okay. Well, what's the message got to do
[59:59] with me?
[1:00:01] Everything.
[1:00:03] Hallelujah.
[1:00:05] What's your name, brother?
[1:00:06] Mark. Okay. You're the reason God sent a
[1:00:09] prophet.
[1:00:09] Hallelujah.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:12] Oh, the prophet. The prophet. I ain't
[1:00:14] taking away from that, friends. I We
[1:00:16] understand we're we're under our
[1:00:17] prophet's message. We understand the
[1:00:19] Eleazar call.
[1:00:20] Amen. But but Rebecca's eyes didn't
[1:00:23] remain on Eleazar forever.
[1:00:25] Amen.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:27] Eleazar was sent to get Isaac a bride.
[1:00:30] At some point, her eyes were on Isaac.
[1:00:32] Amen.
[1:00:33] Amen.
[1:00:33] You're the reason God sent a prophet.
[1:00:35] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:00:37] Amen. Our revelation at one time was
[1:00:40] was, you know, uh, this message was sent
[1:00:42] my way and if I could just become this,
[1:00:44] uh, if I could just be changed and, uh,
[1:00:47] you know, uh, I don't like this and
[1:00:49] that. If I could just, you know, oh, I
[1:00:51] got to try so hard and if I could just
[1:00:52] be changed. And that was kind of our
[1:00:54] revelation at one time as a child.
[1:00:56] But as we began to grow, we began to
[1:00:59] realize this message was not sent to
[1:01:01] change me.
[1:01:03] This message was sent to show me who I
[1:01:05] am.
[1:01:10] And I'm finding myself in the word.
[1:01:12] This message is in the word,
[1:01:14] but it's a light shining on the word.
[1:01:18] Bringing to light my day and its
[1:01:19] message. I found myself in the volume of
[1:01:22] the book.
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:23] Amen.
[1:01:24] And I say, be it unto me
[1:01:26] according to thy word.
[1:01:29] Hallelujah.
[1:01:29] Now, now back to the mind versus the
[1:01:31] soul, friends. You know, I by God's
[1:01:34] grace, I I quit my job in uh 2009.
[1:01:38] So, uh it's been five years now. I I've
[1:01:41] been working full-time, pastoring
[1:01:43] full-time. Every vacation I ever had,
[1:01:45] any spare time I had, weekends, what
[1:01:47] have you, I was out preaching somewhere,
[1:01:49] taking care of the f I I I look back now
[1:01:51] and I think, how did I do it? Well, I
[1:01:53] know how I do it. It was him.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:55] But back then, I didn't think I was
[1:01:56] doing enough.
[1:01:57] Now, I'm thinking, man, I'd like to be
[1:01:58] able to do half that much.
[1:02:01] But my burning desire was to just be uh
[1:02:05] uh in the ministry and that's it. But
[1:02:08] the Lord hadn't given me the nod. And I
[1:02:10] can look back very easily now and see
[1:02:12] how I was being schooled and trained in
[1:02:14] the natural work that I was in.
[1:02:17] You know, we're not going to a finishing
[1:02:18] school when we leave here.
[1:02:20] You know, we're going to rule and reign
[1:02:22] in the millennium.
[1:02:23] Amen.
[1:02:24] So, in order to rule and reign there,
[1:02:25] you got to start doing it here.
[1:02:28] So, we're getting our education on this
[1:02:29] side. Amen.
[1:02:30] Our spiritual education.
[1:02:32] Amen.
[1:02:34] Amen.
[1:02:35] So, uh I I sought the Lord and the Lord
[1:02:38] made a way in in 2009 and and uh and he
[1:02:41] put before me. He says it's your choice.
[1:02:44] You know, you can you can continue to
[1:02:45] work and and uh uh serve me or you know,
[1:02:48] I've made a way now for you to just go
[1:02:50] into the ministry and that's it. Well,
[1:02:52] that had been my desire. In fact, Satan
[1:02:54] had would try to beat me up every time
[1:02:56] I'd be in special meetings or whatever,
[1:02:57] and that anointing would come up, you
[1:02:59] know, and you know how you make these
[1:03:00] stupid claims in your mind that, well,
[1:03:02] I'm going to go home and I'll never do
[1:03:03] this again and I'll never, you know,
[1:03:05] right?
[1:03:06] Because you're you just your faith is up
[1:03:08] at such a level and right, hallelujah.
[1:03:12] It ain't about you. It's about him.
[1:03:15] Thank him for that.
[1:03:17] But the devil would beat you up and say,
[1:03:19] you know, well, you know, if you really
[1:03:20] were a pastor, what are you working for?
[1:03:22] Well, I don't know why my why my prophet
[1:03:24] work for 17 years and pastor. You know,
[1:03:28] all I know is that he hadn't told me to
[1:03:29] quit yet. So, you know, I don't care
[1:03:31] what anybody else says. When he tells
[1:03:33] me, I'm going to do it.
[1:03:34] Well, he made a way for me. And I
[1:03:36] thought, man, this is going to be the
[1:03:37] easiest thing I ever did. You know, I
[1:03:38] just can't wait to tell them, you know,
[1:03:40] uh uh take this job and uh uh do
[1:03:44] something with it, right? Come on,
[1:03:46] friends. You're a human being. You know
[1:03:48] how you felt as humans sometimes, you
[1:03:50] know?
[1:03:52] you know, you build up these lists of,
[1:03:54] you know, I don't want to put up with
[1:03:55] this and put up with that, but you're
[1:03:56] being schooled. You're being trained.
[1:03:58] God has placed you where he's placed you
[1:04:00] for a reason.
[1:04:00] Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:02] So, I thought, man, it's going to be so
[1:04:03] easy. And well, they made it hard. I was
[1:04:06] moving up. I've never tried to get ahead
[1:04:08] ever. I've never looked and never tried
[1:04:10] to use somebody as a stepping stone, but
[1:04:12] because of the gifts that God places in
[1:04:14] your life and a a Christian is the best
[1:04:15] employee that you have.
[1:04:17] Amen.
[1:04:18] you know, I'm working in industry and
[1:04:20] and they got to train people how to, you
[1:04:23] know, don't say something that offends
[1:04:24] somebody. It's like, you got to train
[1:04:26] somebody in that. You know, that these
[1:04:29] are Christian principles. You know, if
[1:04:31] you say something and somebody overhears
[1:04:33] it and they're offended by it, it don't
[1:04:35] matter whether you think they should be
[1:04:36] offended by it or not. Don't say it and
[1:04:38] go apologize to them. And they're like,
[1:04:40] "Well, that don't make no sense." And
[1:04:41] I'm like, "Yes, it does."
[1:04:44] you know, so they don't have to train
[1:04:46] us,
[1:04:47] but they're trying to get everybody else
[1:04:48] to mimic what we do naturally.
[1:04:51] So, they don't want to let you go.
[1:04:53] So, first they were in shock and I
[1:04:55] thought, well, maybe they just don't
[1:04:56] care. But they were in shock because I'm
[1:04:58] kind of coming to the the prime and, you
[1:05:00] know, things are just starting to get
[1:05:02] interesting. there, you know, uh,
[1:05:05] stock options laying on the table and
[1:05:06] whatever, leadership positions opening
[1:05:08] up and, you know, I already had 300
[1:05:10] engineers working for me and I was in
[1:05:12] charge of about uh, $200 million worth
[1:05:14] of business a year and, you know, so I
[1:05:16] was already entrusted with a lot, right?
[1:05:19] And then and and so first of all, they
[1:05:21] they thought, well, this don't make
[1:05:22] sense. This guy's too young. He's not
[1:05:24] old enough to retire. This don't make
[1:05:26] sense. Uh, uh, uh, so so they sent
[1:05:28] different ones over. Well, did somebody
[1:05:30] offend you? You know, somebody say
[1:05:32] something that you didn't like. No, not
[1:05:34] not any more than usual.
[1:05:37] You know, no, I wouldn't quit over that.
[1:05:40] You know, and you know, I and I I I told
[1:05:43] different ones why why I was doing it.
[1:05:45] Well, that just don't make sense. And
[1:05:46] why would you give all this up?
[1:05:50] So, they said, "Uh, well, you want more
[1:05:52] money?" And I said, "No." They said,
[1:05:53] "We're going to give you more anyway."
[1:05:55] So, right on the spot, they gave me a
[1:05:56] 20% raise. you know, that lasted for
[1:05:58] about a week cuz I gave him two weeks
[1:06:00] notice.
[1:06:04] And I said, "Well, that don't matter."
[1:06:05] And they said, "We're going to give it
[1:06:06] to you anyway." Right? Then they sent
[1:06:09] somebody else to me and they said,
[1:06:11] "Listen, we don't want you to go, okay?
[1:06:14] What's it going to take to keep you?"
[1:06:16] Tell you what, why don't you just write
[1:06:18] your own job description?
[1:06:21] You just tell us what you want to do and
[1:06:23] that's your job, right? That's the
[1:06:26] confidence that they have. in a in a
[1:06:27] true believer
[1:06:29] because they know you're going to do
[1:06:30] what's right and they they don't have to
[1:06:31] motivate you. In fact, you can't
[1:06:33] motivate people. You can't motivate.
[1:06:36] They got to be motivated. They got to be
[1:06:38] driven.
[1:06:40] So, so you you try to play on whatever
[1:06:43] motivates them. You try to dangle in
[1:06:45] front of them whatever it is that that
[1:06:46] that will motivate them. So, anyway, I'm
[1:06:48] sorry. I didn't mean to get off on this,
[1:06:50] but we're we're there.
[1:06:53] So, uh but it's important. I I think
[1:06:55] this would be helpful for you. So they
[1:06:58] said you can have whatever you want.
[1:07:01] Right? So the mind here, right? I
[1:07:04] already made the decision here. It was
[1:07:06] settled. God already spoke. He told me
[1:07:08] make your choice. Right? I chose the
[1:07:11] harder way, but it's the right way.
[1:07:14] Made the choice. But the mind said,
[1:07:16] well, you know, hey, you know, maybe
[1:07:18] just work half time and make make an
[1:07:20] easy job for yourself. You know, they
[1:07:23] told you just make up what you want.
[1:07:24] Well, pick something that's easy. Well,
[1:07:26] I don't know how to part way do
[1:07:27] anything. God wired me that way.
[1:07:29] Whatever I do, I got to do it all the
[1:07:30] way. I just I don't know how to halfway
[1:07:32] do something. I'm not saying I'm better.
[1:07:34] I'm not even saying that's a virtue. All
[1:07:36] I'm saying is that's how I'm wired.
[1:07:38] You know, so so I knew deep down inside
[1:07:40] that if I got halfway involved, the next
[1:07:42] thing you know, I'm full involved.
[1:07:44] You know, I can't just be partly partly
[1:07:46] interested in what they're doing. That's
[1:07:49] why I was successful. That's why they
[1:07:51] they wanted me because they knew I'd put
[1:07:52] my heart into it. But I was 49 years old
[1:07:56] and I couldn't keep doing both. And I
[1:07:58] knew that. I knew that. And my heart was
[1:08:00] just to be serving God's people. So I
[1:08:04] told him, well, you know, and I they'd
[1:08:06] given me, I don't know, few hundred,000
[1:08:08] worth of stock options, but you got to
[1:08:10] stay to to get them. And I just left it
[1:08:13] on the table, walked away, shocked
[1:08:15] everybody. You say, "Well, wasn't that
[1:08:18] wonderful of you? That was so easy." You
[1:08:20] know, I got calls. They didn't replace
[1:08:23] me for a year. They couldn't find
[1:08:26] anybody because I was in kind of in a
[1:08:27] niche area that I had a certain skill
[1:08:29] set and microwave uh technology, high
[1:08:32] frequency radio waves and and you know,
[1:08:37] I'm sorry I'm telling you this, but
[1:08:38] dozens of years of experience, the whole
[1:08:41] I'm not trying to impress. It has
[1:08:43] nothing to do with Here's the point.
[1:08:45] Here's the point that I'm trying to get
[1:08:46] to. My mind started doing this.
[1:08:51] Well, you know, you could do this and
[1:08:52] how about and right and if you remember
[1:08:56] 2009, we went into a recession.
[1:08:58] So, everybody's like, you're nuts. You
[1:09:00] know, what are you doing this for? We're
[1:09:01] going to recession. People in our church
[1:09:03] started losing their jobs. A lot of
[1:09:05] people,
[1:09:06] right? Well, you're doing this now and
[1:09:09] they're not going to be able to support
[1:09:10] you. Well, I I All I know is what the
[1:09:13] Lord told me.
[1:09:14] All I know is what he opened up for me.
[1:09:16] I don't know how it's going to work out.
[1:09:17] I don't know what's in my future. I just
[1:09:19] know who holds my future.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:22] Amen.
[1:09:22] But the thing that I'm trying to get to
[1:09:24] you this morning, and I hope to get back
[1:09:25] to my thought here, and we'll wrap a bow
[1:09:27] around it. We'll come back this
[1:09:28] afternoon, the Lord willing, that it's
[1:09:30] your fault. You're pulling this out of
[1:09:31] me.
[1:09:34] What I'm trying to get across to you is
[1:09:36] that my mind is not who I am.
[1:09:40] It don't have to make sense here.
[1:09:43] I can fear up here and never fear once.
[1:09:48] Amen.
[1:09:49] In my heart, I shall not fear.
[1:09:51] It's settled down here. I believe.
[1:09:54] Amen.
[1:09:55] But in my head, my head might spin
[1:09:58] around and wonder and this and that. I
[1:10:00] got calls for a year or different ones.
[1:10:02] And I actually would would bounce it off
[1:10:04] my wife. Well, honey, what do you think?
[1:10:06] And she knows where I'm at and she's
[1:10:07] smart enough to not give me an answer.
[1:10:10] You know, she knows I'm just using her
[1:10:12] as a sounding board and I'm, you know,
[1:10:13] and she's and she's looking at me and I
[1:10:16] know she's thinking, "Well, honey, you
[1:10:17] you wouldn't be happy if you went back
[1:10:18] and you you know that you're doing what
[1:10:20] the Lord told you to do." My parents
[1:10:22] called me up. What are you doing? You
[1:10:24] know, that's insane. Well, you already
[1:10:26] called me insane for what I believe
[1:10:28] anyway. So, what difference does it
[1:10:29] make? You already thought I was a
[1:10:31] lunatic. So, in for a penny, in for a
[1:10:34] pound. You know, might as well go all
[1:10:36] the way with it.
[1:10:37] If you're going to be a fool for Christ,
[1:10:39] be a real fool.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:40] A heretic.
[1:10:43] So, you know, uh, everybody's
[1:10:45] secondguing and, you know, and I I got
[1:10:48] calls for a year where I got human
[1:10:50] resources called up and they'd try
[1:10:51] again. I had another one. They wanted to
[1:10:53] take me out and talk things over and
[1:10:55] find out, you know, one of them asked me
[1:10:56] said, "So, what are you just against
[1:10:58] bombs now? Is that what the deal is? you
[1:11:01] know, you're just not don't want to work
[1:11:02] for the man. And you know, they they
[1:11:04] were trying to approach me from psych
[1:11:06] psychological different angles, trying
[1:11:08] to find out, you know, why would a guy
[1:11:10] like this leave? You know, you can't
[1:11:13] explain it.
[1:11:15] I did. They won't accept it,
[1:11:17] right? And my mind won't accept it
[1:11:19] either. But down here, I knew I did the
[1:11:20] right thing. And God has blessed it,
[1:11:22] friends. Just multiply it over and over
[1:11:25] and over and over and over.
[1:11:29] But up here I might fear,
[1:11:32] but down here it's unshakable. You
[1:11:34] understand where I'm going?
[1:11:35] It's important that you catch that
[1:11:37] because otherwise the first time you
[1:11:38] fear up here, the devil say, "Well, it
[1:11:40] says fear not and you're fearing and
[1:11:42] what's the matter with you?" That ain't
[1:11:43] me.
[1:11:45] Amen.
[1:11:46] I believe down here.
[1:11:51] I'm sorry. I I'm taking taking too much
[1:11:53] of your time here, but listen to this.
[1:11:58] Oh, when the wicked, even my enemies and
[1:12:00] my foes, come upon me to eat my flesh,
[1:12:02] they stumbled and fell. Though an host
[1:12:04] should encamp against me, my heart shall
[1:12:06] not fear. Though war should rise against
[1:12:09] me, in this will I be confident.
[1:12:15] One thing,
[1:12:17] not three, not five, one thing have I
[1:12:21] desired of the Lord, that will I seek
[1:12:25] after.
[1:12:25] Amen. that I may dwell in the house of
[1:12:28] the Lord all the days of my life,
[1:12:30] to behold the beauty of the Lord, to
[1:12:33] inquire in his temple.
[1:12:36] For in the time of trouble, he shall
[1:12:38] hide me in his pavilion,
[1:12:40] in his secret place.
[1:12:43] He shall place me upon a rock.
[1:12:46] Amen. Friends, this is our day, our
[1:12:49] scripture.
[1:12:50] Amen.
[1:12:51] This is our prophecy.
[1:12:53] Amen. because he's saying, "One thing
[1:12:55] have I desired, that will I seek after,
[1:12:57] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:12:59] Lord." Let me ask you this morning,
[1:13:00] where's the house of the Lord?
[1:13:04] You know, there was a time that I
[1:13:05] thought, "Oh, cool. They're going to
[1:13:07] rebuild the temple maybe over there in
[1:13:08] Israel and they got all the furnishings
[1:13:10] and all that. Isn't that neat?" No, it
[1:13:12] ain't because God's never going back in
[1:13:14] there.
[1:13:15] Amen.
[1:13:15] You know, if we're not careful, we go,
[1:13:16] "Oh, look, they got the manora and they
[1:13:18] got Oh, wouldn't it be neat to get the
[1:13:19] ark of the covenant?" Not really, cuz
[1:13:21] he's never going back in there.
[1:13:23] That was a shadow.
[1:13:24] Amen.
[1:13:25] We're not living in the shadow.
[1:13:27] We're living in the fulfillment. He
[1:13:29] said, "A body hast thou prepared for me.
[1:13:31] The most high dwelleth not in houses
[1:13:33] made by human hands, but a body hast
[1:13:36] thou prepared me." He's been preparing a
[1:13:39] body for himself for 2,000 years.
[1:13:43] Upon this rock, I'll build my church,
[1:13:45] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:13:47] against it. He started at the feet. He's
[1:13:49] been building it up to the head.
[1:13:50] Now he's got a body and he's stepping
[1:13:52] into it in this hour.
[1:13:54] Hallelujah.
[1:13:55] The fullness of the word.
[1:13:58] Amen.
[1:13:58] The theophite Christ himself came down.
[1:14:01] Amen.
[1:14:02] In a word coming.
[1:14:03] Amen.
[1:14:04] Amen. He's he's tabernacling in a body.
[1:14:07] One foot on the land, one foot on the
[1:14:09] sea.
[1:14:10] On ecclesiastical powers, on on
[1:14:13] political powers.
[1:14:14] Amen.
[1:14:15] Amen.
[1:14:16] stepping into a body and he's the head
[1:14:20] uniting with that body.
[1:14:22] And David said, "One thing have I
[1:14:24] desired that will I seek after that I
[1:14:26] may dwell in the house of the Lord."
[1:14:28] Guess what? Where's the house of the
[1:14:30] Lord?
[1:14:31] Right here.
[1:14:32] Amen.
[1:14:33] That I may dwell that I
[1:14:36] in the time of trouble, he shall hide me
[1:14:38] in his pavilion. You know what the word
[1:14:39] pavilion means? Tent.
[1:14:43] Oh, don't get nervous. Oh, he's going to
[1:14:46] preach the tent vision. Okay, I guess I
[1:14:48] will.
[1:14:51] First poll dealt with your flesh,
[1:14:54] right?
[1:14:54] Second poll dealt with your spirit.
[1:14:56] Amen.
[1:14:57] Third poll deals with your soul.
[1:14:59] In that your soul, you either believe or
[1:15:01] you doubt.
[1:15:03] When you're born again, you only believe
[1:15:05] in your soul.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:07] That's that third realm.
[1:15:08] Amen. That's the place where that gene's
[1:15:11] at that he comes down to unite with
[1:15:14] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:16] Amen.
[1:15:16] And brother Brandon said it's a
[1:15:18] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:15:19] personally. Of course, the shikina glory
[1:15:21] is now in here.
[1:15:22] Amen.
[1:15:23] In that third realm, people say, "Well,
[1:15:25] I can't see it." Well, I can't either. I
[1:15:27] can't see past this veil. I can't see
[1:15:29] through those badger skins.
[1:15:30] Amen.
[1:15:31] Amen. But I know what's taking place in
[1:15:33] there.
[1:15:34] The real me.
[1:15:36] Amen.
[1:15:37] I will come in in this age and suck with
[1:15:40] you and you with me.
[1:15:42] Nobody else is in there. You're no
[1:15:44] longer under a natural light. You're
[1:15:46] under a supernatural light.
[1:15:48] The pillar of fire is here this morning,
[1:15:50] sir.
[1:15:51] Tabernacled
[1:15:53] behind badger skins,
[1:15:55] tabernacled in human flesh.
[1:16:01] One thing have I desired of the Lord,
[1:16:02] that will I seek after, that I may dwell
[1:16:05] in the house of the Lord.
[1:16:07] Guess what? If you're born again by the
[1:16:10] of the word, by the spirit in this age,
[1:16:15] he has made his tabernacle in you.
[1:16:18] So, you are you are a portion of the
[1:16:20] tabernacle of the living God.
[1:16:21] Amen.
[1:16:22] Is that right?
[1:16:22] Amen. And then he tells us, "In that
[1:16:26] day, you shall know I'm in the Father.
[1:16:29] The Father's in me. I'm in you and you
[1:16:33] are in me."
[1:16:34] And a prophet of God said, "This is that
[1:16:36] day."
[1:16:37] Right?
[1:16:38] Well, how does that work now? Okay.
[1:16:40] Well, he's made his tabernacle in me, so
[1:16:42] he's in me,
[1:16:44] right?
[1:16:44] But I'm in his tabernacle.
[1:16:47] So, obviously, I'm not Obviously, this
[1:16:49] can't be me. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:16:52] This is the tabernacle.
[1:16:54] Amen.
[1:16:55] This is the part that deals with the
[1:16:56] elements of the world and all that.
[1:16:58] Amen. But in there,
[1:17:01] I'm in him.
[1:17:03] And he's in me.
[1:17:04] Amen.
[1:17:06] Hallelujah.
[1:17:07] You see, 2,000 years ago when he went to
[1:17:09] the cross, I was in him.
[1:17:11] Amen. But now he's in me.
[1:17:15] I was the mystery hidden in him. And now
[1:17:17] he's the mystery revealed in me.
[1:17:20] Hallelujah.
[1:17:22] Hallelujah.
[1:17:24] Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] He shall place me upon a rock. What has
[1:17:28] he done? He's placed you on the
[1:17:30] revelation of his word.
[1:17:31] Everything else is moving around you.
[1:17:33] Everything else is sinking sand.
[1:17:35] Everything else has no foundation. It's
[1:17:38] falling this way and falling that way.
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:41] Amen.
[1:17:41] But he's placed you on a rock.
[1:17:43] It ain't moving, friends. Amen.
[1:17:46] He says once more I shake not the earth
[1:17:48] only but heavens also.
[1:17:49] Everything that can be shaken is being
[1:17:52] shaken.
[1:17:52] Amen.
[1:17:53] Is that right?
[1:17:54] But you're not going to fall.
[1:17:56] Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] Why? Because he's placed you on a rock.
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:17:59] You say, "Well, what about all these
[1:18:00] voices?" I don't hear any voices. I'm in
[1:18:03] that third realm.
[1:18:04] Yes, sir.
[1:18:04] I hear one voice.
[1:18:06] I see one light.
[1:18:09] Amen. And it's a bright light.
[1:18:10] Amen.
[1:18:11] I'm in that presence.
[1:18:12] Amen. Oh friends,
[1:18:15] let that break on you this morning. Let
[1:18:17] that be driven down in you.
[1:18:19] Don't look for something off in the
[1:18:20] future. He's here now.
[1:18:22] You've got privileges now as a son or
[1:18:24] daughter of God. You He's The purchasing
[1:18:27] work is done. He's paid the price for
[1:18:29] everything that belongs to you.
[1:18:31] But it's time for us to take what
[1:18:32] belongs to us, claim it,
[1:18:36] and enforce it.
[1:18:38] Amen.
[1:18:40] Can I have just a couple more minutes? I
[1:18:42] I got to find a place to pull over here.
[1:18:44] I I I'm on page nine of 35. We ain't
[1:18:47] going to get there, but I I got to find
[1:18:49] a way to pull over. All right,
[1:18:50] somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:18:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:54] So, we need to stand up against our
[1:18:56] adversary in this age and fear not.
[1:19:00] Fear not.
[1:19:03] Isaiah 43:1.
[1:19:06] But now, thus sayeth the Lord that
[1:19:08] created thee, oh Jacob, and he that
[1:19:10] formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I
[1:19:13] have redeemed thee. I have called thee
[1:19:16] by thy name. How many knows he knows
[1:19:18] your name this morning?
[1:19:20] Thou art mine.
[1:19:22] When thou passeth through the waters, I
[1:19:25] will be with thee, and through the
[1:19:27] rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
[1:19:30] your pastor took us down here to where
[1:19:32] the de moine's river and that other
[1:19:34] river that uh that's that's draining
[1:19:36] into it and you know we see the the
[1:19:38] different confluences and shown how
[1:19:40] people get flooded and all that. He says
[1:19:41] you don't got to worry about that. I
[1:19:44] will be with thee and through the rivers
[1:19:46] they shall not overflow thee and when
[1:19:48] thou walst through the fire. How many's
[1:19:50] walking through fire this morning?
[1:19:52] Amen.
[1:19:52] Thou shalt not be burned.
[1:19:55] Neither shall the flame kindle upon
[1:19:57] thee.
[1:19:58] Verse three. For I am the Lord thy God.
[1:20:04] I want you to say that this morning. For
[1:20:06] I am the Lord thy God. I am the Lord thy
[1:20:12] God.
[1:20:13] The Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I
[1:20:17] gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and
[1:20:19] Sa for thee. Friends, he's still the I
[1:20:22] am this morning.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] Well, maybe pull over on this scripture
[1:20:28] here. I know this is this is simple. I
[1:20:30] know it's it's elementary, but it ain't
[1:20:32] a matter whether it's complicated. It's
[1:20:33] a matter of whether we believe it or
[1:20:35] not.
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:36] Romans 8:28.
[1:20:39] And we know, not we think or we hope. We
[1:20:41] know that all things work together for
[1:20:45] good.
[1:20:46] I want you to know this morning, you're
[1:20:47] the biggest employer there is on the
[1:20:49] face of the earth because everything's
[1:20:50] working for you.
[1:20:51] Amen.
[1:20:53] All things work together. Whether you
[1:20:55] perceive it's good or not, it's working
[1:20:57] for you.
[1:20:59] To them that love God. How many loves
[1:21:00] God this morning?
[1:21:02] To them who are called according to his
[1:21:04] purpose.
[1:21:06] For whom he did forno.
[1:21:08] He also did predestinate. He set your
[1:21:12] destiny
[1:21:13] to be conformed to the image of his son.
[1:21:16] He's already made up his mind that
[1:21:17] that's what's going to happen to you.
[1:21:19] He set your destiny that he might be the
[1:21:22] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[1:21:26] whom he did predestinate them, he also
[1:21:28] called. Whom he called. These are all
[1:21:30] past tense words. They're not future.
[1:21:32] He's not doing it. He's done it.
[1:21:36] Whom he called, them, he also justified.
[1:21:38] Whom he justified, them he also
[1:21:40] glorified.
[1:21:41] And then after Paul says this, he's he's
[1:21:44] he's saying, "Okay, now what do we have
[1:21:45] to say about this?" He says, "What shall
[1:21:47] we then say to these things?"
[1:21:50] Come on, friends.
[1:21:51] He said, "If God be for us,
[1:21:55] Who
[1:21:56] can be against this?
[1:21:59] What power can be raised up over you?
[1:22:02] What can hold you back from your
[1:22:04] destiny? What can defeat you? What can
[1:22:07] keep you from fulfilling the word of God
[1:22:10] in your life?
[1:22:12] What spirit, what power,
[1:22:14] death itself is not going to hold me.
[1:22:17] Friends, there's a people standing here
[1:22:18] right now on the face of the earth that
[1:22:20] are going to look death right in the
[1:22:22] face and they're going to say, "Buddy,
[1:22:23] not this time.
[1:22:25] You're not taking me.
[1:22:28] I'm taking these elements with me."
[1:22:30] Amen.
[1:22:31] There's a part of this dirt that's going
[1:22:32] to unite with my theophony and become my
[1:22:34] glorified condition.
[1:22:36] But I claim it right now in the name of
[1:22:38] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:22:42] If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:22:45] He that spared not his own son, but
[1:22:47] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[1:22:49] he not with him also freely give us all
[1:22:53] things?
[1:22:57] I hope the devil's listening this
[1:22:58] morning.
[1:23:00] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:23:03] God's elect?
[1:23:05] It's God that justifieth.
[1:23:09] Who is he that condemnth?
[1:23:12] Friends, that old condemning spirit
[1:23:13] comes around. That ain't God.
[1:23:16] I I I got to preach this for just a
[1:23:19] moment. We will pull over.
[1:23:20] I'm a third of the way through my notes,
[1:23:22] but I got to I got to drive this home.
[1:23:25] If you've been born again, you were a
[1:23:27] sinner saved by grace. But get over it.
[1:23:30] You're no longer a sinner.
[1:23:32] You're born of God.
[1:23:35] You see, we used to think, we used to uh
[1:23:37] uh uh get the picture in our mind that
[1:23:39] God wanted to have a family. And you
[1:23:41] know, he was he was alone. He wanted to
[1:23:42] have a family and got tired of living
[1:23:44] alone. That kind of a thing. But our
[1:23:47] revelation has progressed and has grown
[1:23:49] and as as as we're maturing and we find
[1:23:52] out God didn't want to have a family. He
[1:23:54] wanted to be a family.
[1:23:55] Amen.
[1:23:57] Amen.
[1:23:57] He wants to be a husband. He wants to be
[1:23:59] the wife.
[1:24:00] He wants to be the the student that can
[1:24:03] hold their head up.
[1:24:04] He wants to be the young person that's
[1:24:06] not out there listening to rock and
[1:24:08] roll.
[1:24:09] He wants to live out his thoughts
[1:24:12] on the earth and be a testimony.
[1:24:15] This is this is my thought on the
[1:24:17] matter.
[1:24:18] He doesn't want it. Friends, if all it
[1:24:20] was concerned about was the word, he
[1:24:22] always had the word.
[1:24:23] He wanted the word to be manifested.
[1:24:26] He wanted it to be expressed. He wanted
[1:24:28] to live out every portion of it.
[1:24:31] And you are a portion of what he's
[1:24:32] living out.
[1:24:35] You are of your thoughts of your father.
[1:24:37] You're of the gene of your father.
[1:24:40] That portion of you that came from him
[1:24:42] is without sin.
[1:24:44] Amen.
[1:24:44] We were told when the book came open.
[1:24:46] See, Luther all through the seven ages.
[1:24:49] Uh I'm I'm I'm sorry. I am closing.
[1:24:53] But you see the full message of each age
[1:24:56] was never preached.
[1:24:57] There was a mysterious element that
[1:24:59] remained despite the revelation.
[1:25:01] Amen.
[1:25:02] That's right.
[1:25:02] Which we call the seven thunders.
[1:25:04] Amen. It's it it's the full message of
[1:25:06] each age, but there was a mysterious
[1:25:08] element that was left out.
[1:25:10] So Luther preached uh uh I'm justified,
[1:25:14] right? I'm forgiven.
[1:25:17] Right? It's in the sea of God's
[1:25:19] forgetfulness. I did it.
[1:25:22] I did it,
[1:25:24] but God forgave me.
[1:25:26] Right?
[1:25:27] But when the word came fully open, we
[1:25:30] realized that ain't the whole story.
[1:25:34] What we find out is I ain't forgiven. I
[1:25:37] never did it.
[1:25:41] Now remember, there's two of you sitting
[1:25:42] here this morning.
[1:25:44] And if you don't catch that, that part
[1:25:46] of you that ain't you is going to say,
[1:25:48] "Now hold on there, fella.
[1:25:50] Uh you there's a rubber truck waiting
[1:25:52] for you outside. We got some pills for
[1:25:55] you. You got delusions here.
[1:25:58] And I got a scripture for you. You're
[1:26:00] calling him a liar. You're saying you're
[1:26:01] without sin. Yes, I am.
[1:26:03] Listen, you never Oh, I could go so many
[1:26:06] different directions. I ain't going to.
[1:26:07] I'm going to try and pull over. We'll
[1:26:08] save save it for tonight. You never did
[1:26:11] it to begin with.
[1:26:13] Right now, think about that. Where were
[1:26:15] you to begin with?
[1:26:17] You never did it in the first place.
[1:26:21] Where were you in the first place?
[1:26:27] You say, "Well, the scripture says we
[1:26:29] were chosen of God." Well, that's part
[1:26:31] of what it says. What's the rest of it
[1:26:33] say? You were chosen in him.
[1:26:38] So,
[1:26:40] everyone that's his is going to come.
[1:26:47] Sorry, I'm not a vital question.
[1:26:50] I haven't figured out how to drink water
[1:26:51] and keep preaching.
[1:26:57] Although, when I give the spit baths,
[1:26:58] which are free, there's
[1:27:00] towels that come with it with the
[1:27:02] showers. You might wonder
[1:27:06] there's a part of you that came from
[1:27:08] him. If there hadn't been a fall, your
[1:27:12] name was on a book and on that book is
[1:27:14] God's whole family.
[1:27:15] And they are going to come by come by
[1:27:17] the spoken word.
[1:27:19] Amen.
[1:27:20] But there was a fall, right? And it
[1:27:22] looked like Satan got the upper hand. He
[1:27:24] never did.
[1:27:26] He isn't. He won't. He never did. He
[1:27:28] didn't. He did not He did not break
[1:27:30] God's plan.
[1:27:32] God knew that was going to happen.
[1:27:34] And it's how he's expressing himself.
[1:27:36] We wouldn't know what light is unless
[1:27:38] there was darkness.
[1:27:39] We had to see the law of contrast.
[1:27:42] And you're that you're that expression.
[1:27:46] You're the light where there's darkness.
[1:27:50] Well, they're criticizing me. Of course,
[1:27:51] darkness is criticizing you. But press
[1:27:54] on.
[1:27:55] You're the light. Amen.
[1:27:57] So you were in him. Looked like there
[1:28:00] was a It looked like God's plan was
[1:28:02] messed up, right? There were names on a
[1:28:04] book. It's the family of God, attributes
[1:28:06] of God. All the family that's going to
[1:28:08] come forth and every one of them will be
[1:28:09] a son or daughter of God.
[1:28:11] So there was a fall and it looks like,
[1:28:13] oh man, it's it's hopeless. How are they
[1:28:16] going to come forth? Well, guess what?
[1:28:18] Satan did not interrupt God's plan at
[1:28:20] all. Every name that was on that book is
[1:28:23] still coming forth.
[1:28:26] Amen.
[1:28:28] But they're coming forth by a second
[1:28:30] birth.
[1:28:32] Is that right? Yes.
[1:28:34] And if you could get the revelation this
[1:28:36] morning, if it could break on you that
[1:28:38] when you are born again by his spirit as
[1:28:42] a true son or daughter of God, if if if
[1:28:45] you would have been spoke into existence
[1:28:46] and came onto the earth as you were
[1:28:48] supposed to, if you could get the
[1:28:50] revelation this morning that when you do
[1:28:52] come forth by your second birth, it's
[1:28:54] the same as you would have in the first
[1:28:56] birth. Amen.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:28:59] The difference is you've got this pest
[1:29:01] house to battle against, but you're the
[1:29:03] same person.
[1:29:05] You're the same son or daughter that
[1:29:07] would have come forth.
[1:29:10] And you're what the blood was shed for.
[1:29:13] He didn't come to save everybody that
[1:29:15] was lost. Actually, he did. He did come
[1:29:17] to save everybody that was lost, but not
[1:29:19] everybody was lost.
[1:29:23] to lose something. You know, uh if I
[1:29:26] said to uh uh uh brother Isaac this
[1:29:28] morning, "Brother Isaac, you lost my
[1:29:29] keys." Brother Isaac would look at me
[1:29:32] kind of strange. "Well, you don't even
[1:29:33] have a car. What are you talking about?"
[1:29:34] You know, you're He flew over here. What
[1:29:36] are you talking about? Brother Isaac
[1:29:37] would say to me, "I don't have your
[1:29:38] keys." "Oh, you you lost my keys."
[1:29:41] "Well, I never had them. How could I
[1:29:43] lose them?"
[1:29:44] You can't lose something you never had.
[1:29:49] He came to seek and to save that which
[1:29:52] was lost.
[1:29:54] And what was lost was his sons and his
[1:29:56] daughters, but he knew where they were
[1:29:58] at all along. And Jesus made the boast.
[1:30:01] He said, "I thank you, Father. All that
[1:30:03] you've given me, they're going to come.
[1:30:05] I got their names written on my hand, on
[1:30:08] my pulse. I'm not going to lose one.
[1:30:12] I took off my royal robes. I found a
[1:30:15] treasure buried in the field
[1:30:17] and I came and I bought the whole earth.
[1:30:20] I traded everything. I paid the full
[1:30:23] price.
[1:30:24] I bought the field.
[1:30:27] Because of what was buried in the field.
[1:30:29] And when I found what was buried in the
[1:30:31] field, I went and rearied them in the
[1:30:34] same field and I bought the field.
[1:30:38] Friends, Satan heard that boast. Satan
[1:30:41] heard go uh Jesus making that statement.
[1:30:43] He thought, "Oh man, he bit off more
[1:30:44] than he could chew." Now, that means
[1:30:47] because he knew there'd be millions,
[1:30:49] billions of people living on the world,
[1:30:50] and he thought, "How's he going to know
[1:30:52] who are his and who isn't?" I I don't
[1:30:54] know who they are. He didn't even know
[1:30:55] that was the son of God. You say, "Well,
[1:30:57] yes, he did. Then why'd he crucify him?"
[1:31:01] He figured it out when the pillar of
[1:31:02] fire showed up that had been when that
[1:31:06] same
[1:31:07] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:31:11] He knew the one that spoke.
[1:31:12] Amen. and said, "Let there be. Let there
[1:31:14] be." He knew that one.
[1:31:16] The theophenite Christ.
[1:31:18] But when it was hidden behind the veil,
[1:31:20] he wasn't sure.
[1:31:21] He tested him like he did all the other
[1:31:23] prophets. Are you that one? So he said,
[1:31:24] "If thou be the son of God."
[1:31:27] You don't say, "If if you know who it
[1:31:29] is,
[1:31:30] if thou be." That's why he's doing it to
[1:31:32] you, friends.
[1:31:33] He says, "If you're a son of God, Isaac,
[1:31:35] but it's up to you to say, well, wait a
[1:31:37] minute. There ain't no if about it.
[1:31:39] I am a son of God. Don't wait for him to
[1:31:42] tell you.
[1:31:45] You're the one that has to know who you
[1:31:46] are.
[1:31:47] I found myself in the volume of the
[1:31:49] book. I found my name. I'm the I'm the
[1:31:51] overcomer of Leosa. I'm the one who's
[1:31:54] alive and remains. I'm the one that's
[1:31:56] not going to pass the baton. I'm the one
[1:31:58] that's taken full possession. I'm the
[1:32:00] one that's got the title deed. I'm the
[1:32:02] one that's got the full word. I'm the
[1:32:04] one that's eating this. I'm the one
[1:32:06] that's met Christ myself. I've taken
[1:32:10] that book from his hand. I'm eating it.
[1:32:13] And now I'm prophesying again.
[1:32:16] Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] Finishing the great commission that
[1:32:20] couldn't be finished until this age.
[1:32:22] Hallelujah.
[1:32:22] Because this gospel must be preached
[1:32:24] again. This gospel. And then shall the
[1:32:27] end come.
[1:32:28] This gospel, the full word.
[1:32:30] Amen.
[1:32:31] Amen.
[1:32:32] The Omega church.
[1:32:34] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:35] Blessed be his wonderful name.
[1:32:37] Hallelujah. So if there hadn't been a
[1:32:39] fall, you would have come for it. There
[1:32:41] was a fall. You're still coming for it.
[1:32:44] But Satan says, you know, I don't know
[1:32:45] who are and who isn't. So I'm going to
[1:32:47] bury this guy in religion. I'm going to
[1:32:49] bury this guy. I I don't know what your
[1:32:51] background is, friends. So if I say
[1:32:52] something and it don't apply to, don't
[1:32:54] be offended. I'll point to these chairs.
[1:32:56] I'll bury this guy in sin. I'll bury
[1:32:59] this guy uh uh uh with a sex demon. I'll
[1:33:01] bury this guy with alcohol problem. I'll
[1:33:04] bury this guy with a mixed marriage.
[1:33:06] I'll bury this guy with Amen.
[1:33:08] Whatever. I I'll bury this guy with
[1:33:10] three three wives.
[1:33:12] Come on, church.
[1:33:14] I'll bury him so far in sin that God
[1:33:17] will never find that seed.
[1:33:20] But that's why we've got the story of
[1:33:21] the woman at the well.
[1:33:24] Because when that light came over that
[1:33:26] over that gentile,
[1:33:28] when that light came across your path
[1:33:29] and that moisture that she'd been
[1:33:31] hungering and thirsting for,
[1:33:33] that seed was buried so far in sin, but
[1:33:36] he knew who was his.
[1:33:39] When that light struck,
[1:33:41] up she came.
[1:33:43] She went running through the streets.
[1:33:45] This is the one. This is that.
[1:33:48] This is that.
[1:33:50] This is that. Amen.
[1:33:53] How many are How many are here this
[1:33:55] morning that you can say, you know, the
[1:33:56] word of the hour that's coming in this
[1:33:58] day. This is that.
[1:33:59] Amen.
[1:34:00] This is that
[1:34:02] the fulfillment is right here.
[1:34:04] Amen.
[1:34:05] God's fulfilling his word and it's right
[1:34:07] here
[1:34:08] in a human vessel. Oh friends, I'm
[1:34:10] speaking to your soul this morning.
[1:34:13] Get your mind out of the way. Get your
[1:34:15] feelings out of the way. Get your past
[1:34:17] out of the way. Get your future. Get
[1:34:19] your history. Whatever you did, whatever
[1:34:22] you didn't do, set it all aside.
[1:34:26] There is therefore no condemnation to
[1:34:28] those that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:34:30] None.
[1:34:31] Who can lay anything against the charge
[1:34:33] of God's elect? Who can who can point
[1:34:35] their finger at you this morning?
[1:34:38] Who can point their finger at you? It's
[1:34:39] God that justifith.
[1:34:41] Isn't that what we read? He's the one
[1:34:43] that justifies.
[1:34:45] If he said, "I never did it."
[1:34:47] Somehow I got to believe that.
[1:34:52] It seems impossible, but he's talking
[1:34:54] about a part of me that I didn't know
[1:34:56] existed.
[1:34:58] Amen. But when that light came, there
[1:35:00] was a deep call into the deep and it
[1:35:02] struck that part of me.
[1:35:04] That son of God that's inside of me.
[1:35:08] I never did it in the first place
[1:35:11] because in the first place, I was in
[1:35:12] him. That's right.
[1:35:13] That thought was in him. That's where I
[1:35:16] was.
[1:35:20] and I'm going back to him.
[1:35:24] I have no beginning.
[1:35:26] I have no ending.
[1:35:28] So when that devil who's a tool in the
[1:35:30] hands of God comes along and tries to
[1:35:33] point you to your past, tell him, "You
[1:35:36] know what, Lucifer? Before you were, I
[1:35:38] was.
[1:35:43] You're not the one that justifies me. He
[1:35:45] is. He told me I never did it.
[1:35:50] You want to point to everything that
[1:35:51] I've done wrong? He said, "I never did
[1:35:52] it." It's God that justif.
[1:35:56] There is therefore no condemnation to
[1:35:59] those that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:36:00] Amen.
[1:36:01] Amen. You were guilty. You were on
[1:36:03] prison row. You did deserve death. You
[1:36:06] were under the curse of death. But God
[1:36:08] who's rich in mercy,
[1:36:10] you who once were dead in sins and
[1:36:12] trespasses,
[1:36:13] walking were as all the others. But God
[1:36:16] who's rich in mercy
[1:36:21] quicken that portion in you that came
[1:36:23] from him.
[1:36:24] And that's the part that we're speaking
[1:36:26] to you this morning. That's the part
[1:36:27] that's coming forth.
[1:36:28] That's the part that we're ministering
[1:36:30] to. That's the part that's overcoming.
[1:36:32] That's the part of you that never did
[1:36:34] it.
[1:36:34] That's the part that was in Abraham that
[1:36:36] God recognized.
[1:36:38] He said Abraham never doubted. Up here
[1:36:40] he did. Down there he didn't.
[1:36:43] You say, "But I was afraid." Up here you
[1:36:45] might be, but down here you don't.
[1:36:48] It's settled. You're going on.
[1:36:51] If there's only one that's going to be
[1:36:52] there, it's me.
[1:36:54] Why? Cuz he said so.
[1:36:55] He paid the debt. He paid the price. He
[1:36:58] made the way. I'm going to be there.
[1:37:02] He said it.
[1:37:05] He's the one that justifies.
[1:37:08] So the devil will come along. You did
[1:37:10] this and you've got this problem and you
[1:37:11] still friends. How long are we going to
[1:37:13] put up with that?
[1:37:17] You know, really, you're one of my
[1:37:19] kitties. Why do I hate you then, devil?
[1:37:21] Come on.
[1:37:23] Do you realize that everyone that really
[1:37:25] genuinely wants to serve God, they have
[1:37:27] to be a child of God?
[1:37:31] You desire that because
[1:37:34] that's your daddy.
[1:37:38] You're going to make mistakes.
[1:37:40] You're going to have to say, "I'm sorry.
[1:37:42] There's only one that ever walked the
[1:37:43] face of the earth." had never had to
[1:37:44] apologize.
[1:37:46] Amen. The rest of us, we're going to
[1:37:47] have to apologize for this guy.
[1:37:50] Amen.
[1:37:54] Let me get just give you this example.
[1:37:55] I'm trying to pull over. I really have.
[1:37:57] Let me give you this example. Remember
[1:37:58] when brother Brandham uh uh was he was
[1:38:00] showed a a plow coming running over the
[1:38:04] fence back home and uh a white picket
[1:38:06] fence and he that this guy was kind of
[1:38:08] carrying on and he says, "You can't do
[1:38:10] that. What are you doing?" And on and on
[1:38:12] and on. You know, we won't go through
[1:38:13] the details, but uh the guy smarts off
[1:38:16] to him. So, brother Brand, dukes him
[1:38:18] one, guy hits the ground, he picks him
[1:38:20] up, hits him again, hits the ground,
[1:38:22] picks him up, hits him again. He does
[1:38:23] that until he goes all the way down the
[1:38:24] hill.
[1:38:25] Then he picks him up and he says, "I
[1:38:26] ain't mad at you. I just want you to
[1:38:28] know that you can't talk to me that
[1:38:29] way."
[1:38:30] Right?
[1:38:32] Now, that's being angry and sinning, not
[1:38:35] all things are are legal, but not all
[1:38:38] things are expedient.
[1:38:41] So, so he was told when you see this
[1:38:43] coming avoid that. He would have done
[1:38:45] that,
[1:38:46] right? And we we would look at that and
[1:38:48] say, "Oh, you know, if he did that, you
[1:38:51] know, you got to overcome this, that,
[1:38:52] and the other." It is overcome.
[1:38:54] It is overcome. You can be angry and not
[1:38:57] sin.
[1:38:58] In fact, you better get angry.
[1:39:00] There better be some righteous
[1:39:01] indignation that raises up in you. Amen.
[1:39:05] When you see Heather and Ellen, you
[1:39:07] know, saying their their wife and wife
[1:39:09] and
[1:39:10] Bill and Bob, and it wasn't Adam and
[1:39:12] Steve, it was Adam and Eve.
[1:39:15] Something rises up in you, and you say,
[1:39:16] "That's just perverted."
[1:39:19] Right now, you're not going to go take
[1:39:21] somebody's head off, but it rises up in
[1:39:23] you and you say, "That's wrong."
[1:39:26] If it wasn't there, you you'd let
[1:39:28] somebody ravish your wife and say, you
[1:39:30] know, well, that's, you know, you
[1:39:31] shouldn't do that. Maybe. No, there you
[1:39:32] got a backbone.
[1:39:33] Amen.
[1:39:34] Something something in you rises up. You
[1:39:35] ain't doing that to my wife.
[1:39:38] Amen. I'm angry. I'm not sinning. I'm
[1:39:40] going to take your head off. You ain't
[1:39:42] touching my wife.
[1:39:46] Go a host, rise up against me. I shall
[1:39:49] not fear.
[1:39:53] Oh, blessed be his wonderful name.
[1:39:57] We are stopping.
[1:40:00] Who is he that condemnth?
[1:40:03] It's Christ that died, yay, rather, that
[1:40:06] is risen again, who is even at the right
[1:40:09] hand of God, who also maketh
[1:40:11] intercession for us, who shall separate
[1:40:14] us from the love of Christ. Who
[1:40:19] shall tribulation,
[1:40:21] distress,
[1:40:24] Obamacare?
[1:40:26] What? I don't I don't have an opinion
[1:40:28] one way or another. I don't care. Some
[1:40:30] people do, but I guess that's why they
[1:40:33] call it care.
[1:40:37] Those are the cares of this life. I
[1:40:40] already got assurance.
[1:40:46] Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:40:48] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:40:50] peril or sword?
[1:40:53] Listen friends, there's not a hair on
[1:40:55] your head that the devil can touch
[1:40:57] without first getting permission from
[1:40:58] God.
[1:41:00] He can't do anything to you without
[1:41:03] first going by God and saying, "Can I
[1:41:04] put this trial on?"
[1:41:07] Amen. And God will God will say, "Uh uh,
[1:41:10] nope. He ain't ready for that. Put that
[1:41:11] on the staff." Or he'll say, "Yep. Yeah,
[1:41:14] he's ready for that. You know, you're
[1:41:15] going to get your your wing sins there,
[1:41:17] devil, but no, go ahead. All that's
[1:41:20] going to do is bring out that's going to
[1:41:21] prove that my son's my son.
[1:41:24] because I know what's in them.
[1:41:28] You say, "But what about all the trials
[1:41:29] that I go through, brother?" God has
[1:41:32] confidence in you this morning. In the
[1:41:34] real you down on the inside, not on your
[1:41:38] brain, your mental power,
[1:41:42] that part of you that's been quickened
[1:41:44] by the living word.
[1:41:46] Friends, if we had half as much
[1:41:48] confidence in God's word as he has in
[1:41:51] what he's placed in you, there wouldn't
[1:41:53] be a feeble one amongst us. We're coming
[1:41:55] to it. We are.
[1:42:00] What shall we say then? If we're the
[1:42:02] final voice, how are we going to be
[1:42:04] defeated?
[1:42:06] Everything that Christ has been has been
[1:42:08] given unto us to use. Amen. You believe
[1:42:12] that?
[1:42:12] Amen. So, we need to get out of our
[1:42:15] minds this morning that we're
[1:42:16] backsliders. We need to get out of our
[1:42:19] minds that we'll never amount to
[1:42:20] anything. You need to quit that lion
[1:42:23] confession.
[1:42:25] I'm just a poor, pitiful, frail excuse
[1:42:28] for a life. You know that that is not
[1:42:30] humility. That's a lie. What did he say
[1:42:34] about you?
[1:42:36] Sinless, spotless, virtuous.
[1:42:40] I have made her that
[1:42:45] friends. That book, that sealed book,
[1:42:48] nobody could look at it. Nobody could
[1:42:49] touch it. But the worthy one came, open
[1:42:53] the book, and then he tells John, "Come
[1:42:55] take it." John couldn't look at it
[1:42:58] before. Now he's worthy. Why? Because
[1:43:00] the worthy one made him worthy.
[1:43:03] Is that right? We've got to have
[1:43:05] confidence this morning that what God
[1:43:07] has done for us, what he's made you, who
[1:43:10] you really are.
[1:43:16] So when that accuser comes around
[1:43:19] and talks to you like that,
[1:43:22] you you need to remind him, you know
[1:43:24] what, Satan, it's God that justifith.
[1:43:27] It ain't up to you to tell me whether I
[1:43:29] am or I'm not. It's God that justifith.
[1:43:33] Let me just leave you with this thought.
[1:43:36] You know,
[1:43:37] there was a
[1:43:39] something that raised up in our day and
[1:43:41] it's kind of a smart alec thing, but
[1:43:43] kind of cute in the way, but with smart
[1:43:44] out. Yeah, it ain't cute when somebody
[1:43:46] says it, but you know, there was a time
[1:43:48] when somebody doesn't want to talk to
[1:43:50] you. You're giving them a hard time,
[1:43:53] they just walk by. Talk to them. You
[1:43:55] ever heard that? Like a valley girl.
[1:43:57] Talk to them.
[1:43:59] I ain't talking to you.
[1:44:01] I I don't even I don't even You're just
[1:44:02] talking to them, right?
[1:44:06] What we need to do is when the devil
[1:44:07] comes and says you did this and you got
[1:44:09] that problem and you'll never amount to
[1:44:11] anything and all that, you need to say
[1:44:13] talk to the word.
[1:44:18] Look, look, you're telling me that that
[1:44:21] I'm not justified. Let's go talk to God
[1:44:23] about this. Come on. How about that,
[1:44:24] devil? You and me. Let's go talk to him.
[1:44:26] Now you repeat the hymn what you just
[1:44:28] told me
[1:44:29] because it's him that justifith
[1:44:31] and let's see if his confession is the
[1:44:33] same as yours.
[1:44:35] Why do we listen to that fella? Why do
[1:44:38] we let him beat us down? Why do we let
[1:44:41] him keep us living under our privileges?
[1:44:46] It's an identity crisis that's starting
[1:44:48] to leave.
[1:44:49] Amen.
[1:44:50] It's starting to lift.
[1:44:51] Is that right? as we begin to recognize
[1:44:54] who we really are, what our origin is,
[1:44:57] where we're going to,
[1:45:00] what you're here for,
[1:45:06] so just go ahead and remind that devil,
[1:45:08] yes, devil, I was worthy of death
[1:45:10] because of the mess you got me into by
[1:45:14] making me subject to sin nature because
[1:45:16] I became subject to vanity, not
[1:45:18] willingly.
[1:45:21] But the guy that you're condemning, he's
[1:45:23] already dead.
[1:45:25] And you can't try the same man twice for
[1:45:27] the same crime.
[1:45:30] Go ahead and hang him. He's dead. You
[1:45:31] want to hang a dead man, go ahead. But
[1:45:33] I'm not the man that you say I am. I'm
[1:45:37] not identifying with that old man. I'm
[1:45:40] born again of God. I am God's seed, and
[1:45:44] his seed remainth in me.
[1:45:46] So, are you trying to tell me that
[1:45:48] something that came from God could be
[1:45:50] sin?
[1:45:52] No, sir.
[1:45:54] So, Satan, I cast you down. I cast down
[1:45:57] all your reasoning against the word, and
[1:46:00] I take what the word declares about me
[1:46:02] over what you say about me.
[1:46:05] Your accuser will tell you this morning,
[1:46:07] God doesn't hear your prayers. There's
[1:46:10] no need for you to go on, but your
[1:46:13] accuser is cast out. Amen.
[1:46:15] He can't lay a charge against the elect
[1:46:18] of God. But you're the one that has to
[1:46:21] confess it. It's got to come from your
[1:46:23] lips.
[1:46:25] You believe that?
[1:46:26] You've got to take authority that's been
[1:46:29] given to you. The victory is yours, but
[1:46:32] you've got to enforce it. You've got to
[1:46:35] take it. God placed you where you're at
[1:46:37] this morning. He's molding you. He's
[1:46:40] shaping you by the pressures of life
[1:46:42] that are unique to Desplaines or Des De
[1:46:44] Moines I mean. Amen. Des Plains is where
[1:46:46] my grandmother lived in Chicago in De
[1:46:49] Moines. Fact we used to come through
[1:46:50] here on the way to Illinois 30 years
[1:46:53] ago. I used to come through Iowa every
[1:46:55] year way to Illinois and Indiana to
[1:46:58] visit grandparents.
[1:47:00] He knows your end
[1:47:02] and he knows what it takes to get you
[1:47:04] there.
[1:47:06] And we're crying double portion of grace
[1:47:09] because we know it has nothing to do
[1:47:11] with anything that we did. It's
[1:47:12] everything what he's done.
[1:47:16] Do you believe that?
[1:47:16] Amen.
[1:47:17] God's image of you this morning is not
[1:47:19] of a weak need crybaby that has
[1:47:22] everything handed to him all the time.
[1:47:24] We might have started that way and we
[1:47:26] all did with a pacifier in our mouth and
[1:47:28] we might have had to be petted and
[1:47:30] burped and spoonfed. But at the end of
[1:47:32] our trials, at the end of our what?
[1:47:34] We're mature. We're solid. We're
[1:47:36] unmoving. We're unflinching in the face
[1:47:39] of every devil.
[1:47:41] We're armed. We're dangerous.
[1:47:44] We've got a razor sharp sword that's
[1:47:46] been proven. We're schooled. We're
[1:47:48] trained. And we're ready to do battle.
[1:47:51] Amen.
[1:47:51] Let's stand to our feet this morning.
[1:47:53] Hallelujah.
[1:47:55] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:47:58] Oh my.
[1:48:03] Oh, Brother Baker. We're not supposed to
[1:48:05] tempt the devil. Anybody ever heard that
[1:48:07] saying? Oh man, don't don't tempt the
[1:48:09] devil. You know, if you keep saying this
[1:48:10] stuff, you're going to get him afraid or
[1:48:12] you're going to get him mad and he's
[1:48:14] going to be after us all.
[1:48:16] I don't read where the scripture says
[1:48:18] don't tempt the devil, but I do say
[1:48:19] where it see where it says don't tempt
[1:48:21] God.
[1:48:23] I ain't picking a fight with the devil.
[1:48:25] I'm in a fight with him.
[1:48:28] Amen. Now, I got three choices. I I'll
[1:48:31] stop with this. The book's closed. Notes
[1:48:33] are gone.
[1:48:35] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:48:38] I got three choices here this morning. I
[1:48:41] can I can say, "All right, I'm not going
[1:48:45] to fight. I'll just cohabitate with the
[1:48:47] devil. Land for peace, right?
[1:48:52] He can just stay here and squat on the
[1:48:53] land and we'll just live and let live.
[1:48:55] Who am I to judge?"
[1:48:58] The word judges. And if the word is in
[1:49:01] you, the word judges sin.
[1:49:04] Amen. So it's it's judged in you. You're
[1:49:07] the one that's being purged first by the
[1:49:10] word. Is that right? So you've got a
[1:49:12] choice. You can say, "Well, you know,
[1:49:14] just sra and who am I to judge and that
[1:49:16] that's maybe not my cup of tea, but you
[1:49:18] go ahead and live there and we'll
[1:49:20] cohabitate in the same land." Which is
[1:49:22] kind of the direction our nation is
[1:49:23] headed, right?
[1:49:25] Or you can say, "Well, every time the
[1:49:28] devil comes at me, I'll pick up my sword
[1:49:29] and I'll fight him." You're going to be
[1:49:31] pretty busy.
[1:49:33] Right? And you're going to get tired of
[1:49:35] just constantly defending yourself.
[1:49:37] Don't you get tired of that after a
[1:49:38] while? Just defend defend this
[1:49:40] criticism, that criticism, this charge,
[1:49:42] that charge, this coming against you,
[1:49:44] that coming against you. You're just
[1:49:45] defending, right? Or you can say, you
[1:49:49] know what, devil? Uh, we're not
[1:49:51] cohabitating.
[1:49:53] Uh, here's your eviction notice.
[1:49:56] Get off my land.
[1:49:58] I'm taking what belongs to me.
[1:50:04] been to the enemy's camp.
[1:50:06] I'm taking back what he stole from me.
[1:50:09] Amen.
[1:50:09] You can say, "You know what, devil? I
[1:50:12] read in the word, this is my land.
[1:50:14] You're squatting actually right here,

[1:51:49] you facing that for? I'm facing it
[1:51:50] because I'm a Christian.

[1:52:32] But God has given you
[1:52:35] things that belong to you. And we need
[1:52:37] to take an inventory this morning. We
[1:52:39] need to go down the list. Let's see. I I
[1:52:41] had joy. Do I still got that? Where's
[1:52:44] that at? Do I got peace? Uh do I have
[1:52:47] healing?
[1:52:48] Do I have faith?
[1:52:50] Uh do I have right?
[1:52:52] Go right on down that list. And if you
[1:52:55] find something missing, you need to fill
[1:52:58] out a report with the police department,
[1:53:01] with the Holy Spirit.
[1:53:02] You need to fill it out and say, "Lord
[1:53:04] Jesus, I possess this. I don't know
[1:53:07] where it's at. It's missing somehow.
[1:53:10] I don't If it's in my house, Lord, show
[1:53:13] me where it's at.
[1:53:14] But if the devil's taken it from me, I
[1:53:16] want it back.
[1:53:18] So, I want to report this missing this
[1:53:21] morning.

[1:53:37] the claims of God in your life.
[1:53:39] Amen.
[1:53:39] You've got to stand this morning and
[1:53:42] say, "It belongs to me."
[1:53:43] Amen.
[1:53:44] I'm not going to live a mediocre life.
[1:53:46] I'm not going to live a life of
[1:53:48] condemnation. God's not condemning me.
[1:53:50] I'm not going to live a life. He's the
[1:53:52] one that justified me.
[1:53:54] He loves me.
[1:53:55] Amen.
[1:53:56] He's doing everything he can to make
[1:53:58] sure that I make it.
[1:54:00] He's paid the price. He's went to every
[1:54:02] extreme. Friends, God's not trying to
[1:54:05] send you to hell.
[1:54:07] He's trying to redeem you.
[1:54:11] We got to fight against that.
[1:54:15] Well, well, Brother Baker, how could I
[1:54:17] miss it? By by not believing that he
[1:54:19] wants to do that for you.
[1:54:22] Well, I'm unworthy. That's a lie from
[1:54:24] the pits of hell.
[1:54:26] He's made you worthy.
[1:54:27] Amen.
[1:54:30] I'm no good. He's You're the apple of
[1:54:32] his eye.
[1:54:34] I'm not righteous. He's He knew that. He
[1:54:36] granted for you to be robed in his
[1:54:38] righteousness.
[1:54:39] It was granted for you to be arrayed in
[1:54:41] white linen, which is pure and white,
[1:54:43] which is the righteousness of
[1:54:46] we've got to enforce it this morning.
[1:54:48] How many of your challenged this
[1:54:50] morning?
[1:54:51] I am.
[1:54:52] I I'm preaching to myself half the time,
[1:54:54] friends. I get a thought and I get
[1:54:56] stirred up and I think, you know what,
[1:54:57] Lord? I want to live that. I want to
[1:54:59] take that for. That's a good thought,
[1:55:01] Lord. I want to live that in my life.
[1:55:05] Just because we're a minister doesn't
[1:55:06] mean we've arrived. If I've arrived,
[1:55:08] then what am I still doing here?
[1:55:11] We're in this together.
[1:55:12] Amen.
[1:55:13] We're putting our shoulder behind one
[1:55:14] another and we're saying, "Let's go.
[1:55:16] Let's take it.
[1:55:17] We're more than able to take the lamb.
[1:55:19] Let's take it at once. Let's take it in
[1:55:21] haste.
[1:55:23] Let's quit going around and around the
[1:55:24] mountain. Let's take what belongs to us.
[1:55:27] Let's bow our heads. Divine
[1:55:30] heavenly father. Oh God, we just Lord,
[1:55:33] first of all, we just want to tell you
[1:55:34] how much we love you, how much we praise
[1:55:36] you, how much we thank you, Lord, how
[1:55:38] much you mean to us. Oh God, we when I
[1:55:41] look back at my life, Lord, there was a
[1:55:43] time when I I didn't I I was without
[1:55:46] hope, Lord. I was miserable. I was
[1:55:49] bitter. I I I had I I thought everybody
[1:55:53] was this world was just so cruel. There
[1:55:55] was no good in this world. Everybody was
[1:55:57] out to deceive. Everybody was out to
[1:55:59] shake you down.
[1:56:02] Lord, I I I looked for truth. And it
[1:56:04] just depended on who I talked to. I'd
[1:56:06] get partial truth and a lot of
[1:56:08] explanations that didn't make a whole
[1:56:10] lot of sense. Lord, there was something
[1:56:11] in me that thought if your word was
[1:56:14] true, then why aren't we seeing it lived
[1:56:16] out in this day as we've we read about
[1:56:20] the the mighty conquests of the heroes
[1:56:22] of the faith in the days gone by? But
[1:56:25] where are you at in this hour? And we're
[1:56:27] told, Lord, we were told by Baptist
[1:56:30] ministers and different ones that that
[1:56:32] you don't do these things anymore. That
[1:56:33] you you did it all 2,000 years ago, but
[1:56:36] now it's it it's all done. And yet,
[1:56:38] Lord, I could look around and I could
[1:56:39] see the enemy on every side. I could see
[1:56:42] the enemy on the rampage. I knew that he
[1:56:44] was real and he's he's doing works. just
[1:56:47] a just a real destroyer, just a a real
[1:56:51] perverter and a a liar and a deceiver.
[1:56:54] Lord, I never never wanted any part of
[1:56:57] him. But Lord, even in all of that, I I
[1:57:00] knew I wasn't living right, but I knew
[1:57:02] that, Lord, I'd hear the word. I' I'd go
[1:57:05] to revival. I'd go to different things,
[1:57:07] and I get stirred up and and I think, I
[1:57:10] I'm never doing this again. I'm never
[1:57:11] doing that again. Tomorrow's going to be
[1:57:14] a change. I'm turning over a new leaf.
[1:57:17] that Lord, I would find it. It was a
[1:57:19] roller coaster that I was on. I would
[1:57:21] find that each time that I would fall, I
[1:57:24] would fall further than the last time.
[1:57:26] And Lord, I actually got to the place
[1:57:29] where I thought there was no hope. I
[1:57:31] wondered if I'd crossed the line. I
[1:57:33] wondered if I'd send away my day of
[1:57:36] grace. Lord, I knew that I couldn't live
[1:57:38] the life. I knew it. But what I didn't
[1:57:40] know, Lord, was that you never asked me
[1:57:43] to live the life. You asked me to
[1:57:45] surrender to you and let the life come
[1:57:47] and live in me that you would do the
[1:57:50] work, Lord. And so we that was held over
[1:57:53] my head. I was the devil would tell me I
[1:57:56] was unworthy. The devil was telling me
[1:57:58] that I was no good, that I was a wretch,
[1:58:00] and that that really you're probably
[1:58:03] going to send me to hell anyway. I'm
[1:58:05] just not good enough. And and Lord, I I
[1:58:07] I kind of halfway believed him.
[1:58:10] But Lord, one day, one day you made it
[1:58:14] real to me. Father, you showed me that
[1:58:17] that in the in the full surrender to
[1:58:20] you, believing that you paid that price.
[1:58:23] In the full surrender, believing that
[1:58:26] the one that wrote this word would come
[1:58:28] down and do the works that would would
[1:58:30] you would do in me what I could never
[1:58:32] do. Lord, when I finally let go and
[1:58:35] said, "God, I can't do it." That's when
[1:58:37] you that's when it broke. Lord, that's
[1:58:40] when you told me, "Well, see, son, I I
[1:58:42] finally got you to the place that I
[1:58:43] wanted you to get to. While you were
[1:58:45] thrashing there in the water, I couldn't
[1:58:47] save you. I had to wait for you to to go
[1:58:49] limp so that I could jump in and pull
[1:58:51] you pull you safely in." Oh, God, what a
[1:58:55] what a different world it is that I'm
[1:58:57] walking in now, Lord. Father, there was
[1:58:59] a a time when I couldn't go a week
[1:59:02] without feeling like I was just hopeless
[1:59:06] and gone.
[1:59:08] But Lord, you've settled that for me.
[1:59:10] I'm not looking at myself any longer.
[1:59:12] I'm looking at you, the author, the
[1:59:14] finisher. I'm not looking at the outer
[1:59:16] man. Lord, I I want to bring that into
[1:59:18] subjection. And I'm not happy, Lord,
[1:59:20] when the outer man gets out from under
[1:59:22] the the uh authority of the word. And
[1:59:25] Lord, maybe I'm not prayed up like I
[1:59:27] should be or or get a little lax and I
[1:59:29] find that flesh come up and get
[1:59:32] influenced in a way that it shouldn't.
[1:59:34] But then Lord, I I come right to you and
[1:59:36] I say, "I'm sorry, Lord." And you say,
[1:59:38] "Son, I I forgive you." And now get up.
[1:59:42] Keep going. Keep going. I've got an end
[1:59:44] for you. An expected end. I I I just
[1:59:48] grab a hold of my hand. I've got a hold
[1:59:49] of you, son. I won't let go. Just Just
[1:59:52] keep holding on. Oh God, Father, I pray
[1:59:56] for this this precious body here of of
[1:59:58] of believers, Lord. this of of gene of
[2:00:02] your gene, flesh of your flesh, bone of
[2:00:04] your bone, word of your word, the
[2:00:07] purchase of your blood. Father, the
[2:00:09] reason that you sent a prophet in this
[2:00:11] age, the reason that you went to
[2:00:13] Calvary, the reason that you took off
[2:00:16] your royal robes and came down and
[2:00:18] became one of us and gave up all your
[2:00:21] supernatural powers and and defeated the
[2:00:23] enemy with by the word and the word
[2:00:25] only, showing us how we would defeat the
[2:00:28] our enemy in our lives, in our day, not
[2:00:31] by our ability, not by intelligence or
[2:00:33] reasoning, but by your word, oh God.
[2:00:37] Father, I just pray for this precious
[2:00:39] body here this morning. Whatever the
[2:00:41] needs are, I pray that the faith would
[2:00:42] rise through the the roof here this
[2:00:44] morning, Lord. Father, that we would
[2:00:46] believe for the impossible, for all
[2:00:49] things are possible to them that
[2:00:51] believe. Lord, if there's a deep call, I
[2:00:53] believe there's a something to answer.
[2:00:55] You wouldn't give us a desire if there
[2:00:57] wasn't something to meet that desire.
[2:00:58] You wouldn't give us a thirst if there
[2:01:00] wasn't something to quench that thirst.
[2:01:02] Father, as we commit these people into
[2:01:04] your hands, Lord, we just we just ask,
[2:01:07] Father, whatever the needs might be,
[2:01:10] Father, that ra that faith would raise
[2:01:12] to the level that we would step forth
[2:01:14] and grab a hold of what belongs to us.
[2:01:16] Lord, we know that you work so many
[2:01:18] different ways. And we're not trying to
[2:01:20] tell you or dictate, Lord, but we're
[2:01:22] what we are asking, Lord, is is uh we we
[2:01:26] want to go higher, Lord, where we we
[2:01:28] don't want to stay where we're at. We
[2:01:30] want to keep going. Keep keep walking in
[2:01:32] this faith walk. Lord, bring your people
[2:01:35] to a higher level. Father, strengthen
[2:01:37] the pastor. Strengthen the the the the
[2:01:41] officers, the musicians, the all the
[2:01:43] different workers here of the body,
[2:01:45] Lord. And Father, may they just keep
[2:01:47] their focus and keep that fist drawn
[2:01:50] tight, Lord, to give that devil the
[2:01:52] knockout punch that that he deserves
[2:01:53] here in De Moine. Grant it this morning,
[2:01:56] Lord. Father, we love you. We praise
[2:01:58] you. and we commit all things into your
[2:02:00] hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:02:03] Amen. Amen. Do you love him this
[2:02:05] morning?
[2:02:06] Amen. Blessed be his wonderful name.
