amen as our brother comes up hey men amen take me into the Holy of Holies take me into the Holy of Holies take me in by the blood of the leg take me into the holy of holies take the cold smiley here I sing that again please take me in to the holy of holy take me in by the blood of the Lamb take me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what we want God to do amen I want everybody in respect to the church in Iowa not just to think Des Moines not just to think Iowa City but the Church of Iowa because that's what we are and I believe God has given us this whole territory not just a piece of it and so when we do that we understand that the body is not divided we're not two separate churches because one is in Iowa City or one is in Des Moines is that right the Bible tells us that we are one body by one spirit so you and I must recognize and stop beginning to think that way so that we won't find ourselves just so into this when God has so much of this right amen my it's been really on my heart to invite brother lunga on a preach at some point in time you know he was really gracious to us when had us dedicated service and and things like that but when we do I will definitely be present by God's grace but it's just been on my heart to reach out and and understand it's it's just a strain on them as much it is on us because a lot of them can't understand English and a lot of us can't understand French but the love of God compels us to unite at a time when we see the darkness uniting we ought to learn how to unite there are and like I said that which is not right God will make right is that all right but we must not allow ourselves to become denominational that's not the will of God now understand I can't we talk we call how many chances God has given me I'm so glad that God don't give up on me sometimes I give up on myself and God have to kind of slap me a little bit you know to make me wake up and realize that I don't have to give up on myself because he won't forgive up on us and that's what matters more than anything else God will not give up on us yes sir fresh from the throne brother God is so good to us oh he's better to us than we've been to ourselves we want to continue our service hopefully by God's grace we'll be able to complete I don't know I just know that God has given me something and I'm trying to get it over to the people of God and I wish that I can give it to you like I like it came to me all I know is that it has benefited me in the sense that I can see myself clearer now than ever it's something how when you fighting an enemy and he's behind the bush and you can't see him you know you got the right equipment to handle him but you can't see him because of the bush but once the bush has moved out of the way and you can see him guess what the great surprise was I saw who my self which is my greatest enemy it ain't Satan Satan has no power over the bride but it's ourselves that we must work with Saint Matthew the 3rd chapter 17th verse in Saint John 8 chapter 28 this morning I was really uh I can't explain it but spiritually just hurting and then I had a lot of joy and you know it just was a lot of mixed emotions this morning but I trust by God's grace that you were blessed by the word I thank God for allowing my brother Frank to sing that song he was it was right on time it was really an encouragement to me I heard that you anytime we go to Iowa City you might want to join us so be careful to remind me to remind you so you could make the choice or whether you were able to or not anyone else who would like to go at times you're more than welcome I'll do the driving down there and you do the driving as we stand Matthew 3:17 into a voice and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased say John 8:28 then said Jesus unto them when you have lifted up the Son of man then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone but I do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him I want to say by God's grace before I forget when God gives you a territory that territory is yours and I believe that God has given this little bride in DesMoines the territory of Iowa I don't believe that God put us in the Capitol for us just to set in the Capitol so I'm saying this we have a people that I know that God has are called in their lives sister Irene marina and her group and so we got to not only need your prayers and your help because I'm gonna reach out to them again and by God's grace try to somehow get them to see the importance of this message they need to know I know their hearts they love God as much as they but you understand what I'm saying we all have our battles with our reasoning and self and so if we could get us praying and believing that that God will bring them in then I believe it will be so you love the Lord let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything that you have given unto us father most of all I thank you for this opportunity Lord to see that you have been so gracious to us oftentimes I look at self and wonder how can you love such a thing the way you love me and and now I see a God it's just that see that that part of you that you can't help but to love and we thank you for imparting part of that life into us that in spite of all of our shortcomings you love and and not only nor you you chasing us and you correct us and and your bringing us into that perfect statue of Christ you are a beautiful God and you have produced a beautiful situation we're so happy this morning or this evening be part of you there are no words to express our gratitude and we just trust that you would give us Lord the revelation and understanding of how to completely die to ourselves every day all day that that the prophecies of this message may be fulfilled through us your bride in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know I was saying this morning and I'm still willing let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and our theme kill the will we must understand by God's grace that what God is doing in the stage getting us to first of all understand who we are you know we often hear the the pastors and preachers and I have been guilty myself we quote brother Branham and he says when the bride began to see who she is she will become an invincible army well I believe that the bride is beginning to see who she isn't because yesterday I was thinking how long is it going to take for the bride to come to see who she is first of all you must understand that in these last days amen there was a call a Lynn tonight cry according to Matthew 25 the Bible said the five were wise and five were foolish now those five wise Brides had to know Amen who they were otherwise how could they have ever gotten into the door those who were foolish were late and they came to understand that they had an opportunity that they did not make because of their lake of I could have a late arrival upon the revelation on what they were called to be I believe those who are of the bride they are trying their best to trim their lamps they're doing everything they can do Amen to make that eternal fire burn through them and by way of doing that they come to know who they are now you say well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm trying to say this amen the light in which God has given us in this day this message has already separated us from denominationalism and organizational ISM and if we are therefore separated from organizational ISM and denominationalism in that it defines us it began to identify who we really are my point is when we come to a place and we've come to see who we really are we must know the benefits of who we are or what we have rather let's say it like this Amen God has promised us and he that's why I want to work with the word promise now I worked with the fact this morning that we've had to meet God's criteria but understand if God has promised and he has that there will be a bride in this day then there will be a bride is that right but it is up to you by faith to recognize that you are part of that bry right you can't continue to Alette allow reasoning or your own thoughts or your own will affect you in the sense that you have you are doubting God's promise it is like Sarah Sarah was the one who doubted right how can this thing be seeing that I have never known a man on excuse me Mary she didn't know a man and but Sarah laughed it's what I want to say and the promise is that God had promised Abraham that Sarah represents who you and I and we know by God's grace Amen that if God promised did we need not to laugh or look at it as it's impossible you got to understand Sarah look at her physical condition she looked at her spiritual condition whatever it was whatever made her laugh she looked at it it says impossible right if you look at your natural the natural man you're going to come up with the same conclusion it is impossible hallelujah but I asked the question this morning it is evening is there anything too hard for God hallelujah you think that you are a task if God could take a world that was void without shape without form speak the Word of God and then light comes and he forms as any shapes it and he breaks on days and flowers and whatever out of something that was dead and in chaos what do you think God can do for you because let me tell you this you were there you may not have been in your body as you are now but your elements were there hallelujah theirs no extra cents grains of sands hallelujah there is no extra water garden and no extra water he added no more chemicals to this world every piece of this world is still here and you were there in all of that so I want to build your faith because it's really simple it's simple stop thinking on your own let God think for you let God's choices be your choices right when you are in doubt of anything you go to God in prayer you always if you can keep your mind Lord I want to know your will for me today and you keep your mind on that throughout the day God will direct your path why because you have acknowledged him is that right acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways and he shall direct your path right so we are in a place right now and that's that's the way Jesus was that's the way brother Brandon was I believe all the prophets were of the same way it meant they wouldn't move until they got a direct direction from God and you and I need to seek that we need to stop even allowing Satan and I'm speaking to myself because I'm guilty allowing Satan to make us think that we're not in a position to do anything for God because let me say like this the Bible said that the bride of Jesus Christ is justified so if God has already justified you and the Bible said whom God justify he glorified so you understand God can use you God wants to use you hallelujah and I believe by God's grace but we make we must make ourselves available is that right because you and I must understand that that when it came to our Isaiah Isaiah was an unclean man he was he says not i'm unclean i dwelling in and among the people that that that are unclean lord i mean and here isaiah was a great prophet of god but when he came before God he surrendered before God because remember Amen he had aziah as an image but when as iodide as there was left to himself and now he realized Amen there is no covering for me there is nothing for me to hide behind and therefore I need you Lord so when he began to really seek the Lord in that way God unfair unfolds himself unveils himself to Isaiah and the Bible tells us that God took a cold off of the altar placed it on Isaiah trunk and that's when Isaiah says war with me Oh Lord and that's the next thing he goes on to say well Lord if you need somebody send me see when you know a change is taking place in your life and that change came by God not by you but one of the things that Isaiah wanted he had a will and he wanted to his will was to meet the Living God see because what is a prophet if he doesn't have God he's nothing right so let's look at this thing he said I'm saying all these things to let you know that here Jesus Christ who was a man yet God but God used him as an example everything that Jesus did he had to make a decision whether to do it or not alright he was a word the Word was with God the Word was God but as a man he still was subject to vanity is that right brother Adam said he got sick he had headaches I mean those things that that touches our physical RAM touched his physical RAM but there was not one time in the scriptures you find Jesus complaining right because he knew I mean everything that came to him was he's a trial or a test it was the will of God nothing could come by him a come by his way with our God sin in it and we must realize it man we're the same way we are the bride we cannot get out of the test we cannot get out of the trial and we can't run from it many times I have felt many times they long come take my life you know I'm tired of living hallelujah but all that was is a way you escape what you put what God is ordained YouTube to test to take you understand me we can't run from it and and you can't take your life and God you can't give it up until God has sent you through the things in which he has ordained you to go through see because every one of us need each other not one of us said alone in such a sense that God is just consistently thinking about you only but God thinks about his bride and he thinks about how she's operating how well she's moving into that realm that he's already pre predestinated for her right and you and I must understand and just what the Lord spoke to me in this evening on my way to church he said just me he said did you not know the will of Satan is what brought all of the division that's why the Bible tells us in Jude that if a brother bring division in the church he you just think he has the Holy Ghost but the hope because the Holy Ghost doesn't bring division hallelujah how can God tell you in John to love your brother even as yourself and then at the same time that God tells you to hate him despised and rejected whatever that spirit is not of the Lord it is will and it's not it's the devil's will not God's will right it is Satan who comes to steal kill and destroy but it's God who comes to give us life that we may have it more abundantly right so you and I must recognize and understand that God is not padding any of us on the back we have come and we are at war and what are we warring against all unbelief whether it be in you whether it be in your brother it doesn't matter where it is you and I are here to conquer all unbelief that right Jesus mother came unto him and said uh-uh know that called Jesus your father and I remember when they were add up to at the feast and Mary and Martha Mary she's married Joseph was looking for Jesus and they run up to Jesus and and say your father and I we've been looking for you and Jesus corrected the unbelief cuz that's what it was brother Balaam said she had forgotten your visitation from the angel and by speaking that I'm your mother this is your father you just denied your experience and the word immediately corrected her and says know ye not that I'm about my father's business she that's how we are he never thought about oh this is my mother cuz I'm sure that was her it's only returning mother's and mother and father but Jesus took it to the fart the level of what it really was because he heard he heard and he didn't reason with her he didn't even process it in his mind he just straightway came because a word will correct all error I am the word you are the word and you must believe that is that right so you and I must understand that Jesus did everything that please the father even if it was against friendship can you imagine how Peter must have felt when Pete when Peter said to Jesus Lord you're not going to die no this is not the way it's going to happen and Jesus said get behind me Satan but that was his friend that was a disciple of his but he understood he couldn't reason he being the word had to correct the error because what was Satan doing now he was trying to bring in a will and bring in a division right separating Christ from the word and it is our duty to never let mother father sister brother friend or whoever separate us from the word am I making sense because it is our thoughts that makes us why will the devil comes to steal kill and destroy and how does he do that he changes your mind like God said let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus a mind of OBT a mind of surrender a mind Amen that would be subject to the word on the under any cost right and and and if but Satan comes and he tried to switch that thing and he works with our emotions oh god I know I'm guilty me at times I never I didn't witness the people only because of feelings I've had people die on me and I wonder did I tell them enough anybody know what I'm talking about that's why when you ever get a chance you tell them everything that you can whether they like it or not this might be your only opportunity but Satan will make us think for the pulse it is because you might be giving them too much and you may not ever get another chance that's why it's so important to know the will of God to be in the Spirit of God all day right yeah not some all day we ought to fight to stay into the Spirit of God right keep him on your mind is that all right listen Deuteronomy I read that this morning he says 429 but if from his thou shalt seek the LORD thy God thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thine heart and with all thy soul without all in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the LORD thy God and shall be obedient unto his voice for the Lord that God is a merciful God he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them now you and I know that he told Abraham that he had an unconditional covenant right that doesn't mean we go out and we do whatever we want to do oh I can see it I could do whatever I want to do because grace abound there's a there's a church I know other just exist I'm not sure there now if Jr and they called it total grace and in this total grace the women can cut their hair and do whatever they want to but because they believe this message see the devil this message well do we understand it or not is the will of God it's not the thought of a man it is the will of God and we can be submissive or we can be stubborn stubborn this is who you stubbornness is the will of a man it's not the will of God I don't care who you are it is not of God that is a devil but the venom said it like this he said you can't beat a stubborn spirit because that's fuel to the fire I'm paraphrasing it he said beating a stubborn spirit makes the spirit more stubborn how can you get rid of a stubborn spirit only thing you can do is pray and fast and ask God to deliver because some spirit are some stubbornness is like other spirits hereditary so it's difficult some time to get rid of them they're really difficult to get rid of them but is there anything too hard for God I believe that when God saved me he came to clean out every devil devil scene and Devils unseen genetic Devils and every kind of hereditary devil I will not go to heaven with the man's gene no flesh and blood will enter only God's blood a supernatural blood y'all you mean uh-huh when I get to heaven there will be no impatience in brother Brooks see God is getting all that out of me now there will not be Amen ungodliness among me why God is getting rid all of that now oh it won't be long I'm in heaven and I don't have patience you can't you die you die if you didn't have pieces in heaven because there is no time clock see so God is getting all of those things out of me right now well what am i doing I'm pressing toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ Jesus all right pressing and you know what let me tell you something God can't make you believe faith in God is something he gives you faith but he can't make you want it it is something that you desire if you desire God has it for you but faith is a gift and you know you said what brother Brooks walk can't listen every one of us brother and him said like this he said every one of us have our different measures of faith that's why the Bible tells us don't compare yourself to another man you comparing him yeah he's got 50% and you got 60 or he got 60 and you got 50 a man you could never be what he is and he can never be what you are right you look at a boulder a boulder is bigger than a grain of sand but every one of those boulders are built out of grains of sand I can hit you with a piece of grain or say a piece of saying they won't even feel it almost but let me hit you with a boulder it's more than is what a boulder can do for you is far more than what a piece of grain of sand can do you understand what I'm saying but they both made out of the same material if it wasn't for the saying the man wouldn't have a boulder so you know when I'm saying these things I want you to understand by God's grace we are many limit bodies we have been placed into the body of Jesus Christ to do specific things and those are the things that you and I need to inquire of God what we must do instead of trying to analyze how worthy we are so I will tell you today you're not worthy in yourself you are not worthy you will never be worthy it takes Jesus Christ to make you worry well how are you accepted in Christ not by your own deeds you are accepted in Christ by the deeds of Christ he chose you you didn't choose him and you and I need to wake up because God has great things for us I hope everybody's hearing and different ones are listening when we come about our will now it's up to you like I said this morning you have a will you can either serve God or serve the devil your will would go one or the other it will either go left or right right and you will determine that all right I had a sister say what do you think I'm um do you think I'm right because I'm still doing this this and this I said listen I said God chose you and God will change you in his season everything that grows too fast dies anything in the tree that comes out and brings in in in the spring or fall and winter will die everything is according to season and you can't change it so you might as well have patience and trust in God you understand me you said what what do you mean the same thing that's what happened to Saul Sam you say you stay right here till I come back hallelujah and that's what God said stay here till I get back he told his disciple stay here till I get back and God will tell you stay right here till I come back but you get all impatience like you're gonna be able to change yourself you can't change yourself didn't mean to do that but my point is you know it why worry about something you can't change can any man add a cubit to his statue absolutely not but you know what God wants in order to change you he wants a surrendered we'll give it to him even if you don't feel it leaving you give it to him not I give you my will if you keep saying that somewhere it's gonna strike your heart and your heart will deliver it but you gotta first confess it and believe that you're doing the right thing that's where the big tree is right in your mouth the Bible said life and death lays right in the tongue but if you don't say the lord have mercy like Nicodemus did I mean bono Mayer says lord have mercy on me God didn't even see him but he screamed it out because he knew he desired something and if God will be stopped by the voice of us of a blind man what about you just to give him healing sight what about your spiritual cycle if you really want God and you want the blessings of God you got this you got to call him from your heart you got a mean business with God and yet no half-stepping because God can see all of that whether it being neo in you right so when God is speaking amen it's it's always polite to - to listen and if you need to say Amen say Amen because I'm gonna tell you something God is pleased when you are approving his correction now we look at this thing and we must understand he says heaven and earth heaven is the Lord and and and thy God the earth also and all that therein so you know if we see God and with all of our heart and this is what I love he says circumcise therefore the foreskins of your heart and be not stiff neck hmm me all right I used to I used to a couple of my children and one in particular won't call his name but it almost didn't no good because he was born with a stubborn and you know people that they die nowadays they call it hard or you hard that means you're not gonna allow anything to affect you but I would spank my boy now I hit him I would hit him down low he just stand there so I figured out no one gonna hurt you I'm gonna hit you up so I get him in the back it didn't it it didn't faze him my whipping him did not face and trying to help him and all I whipped him for was trying to correct him but it didn't faze him because he stood there stubborn he wouldn't break he wouldn't he wouldn't allow himself to show the the part that God wants to see God wants to see you if affected emotionally God created bottles with tear bottles tear bottles and we set up here like me and we won't even break to the holy spirit and cry not one drop where did we get that from when you master your Lord the Bible said when he went down to the tomb of Lazarus he wept but somehow we allowed our society to break us to put us into a state don't you understand when tears can float that is a release that is a surrender amen of the heart unless you're just acting I love it when God allows me to break into tears because I know that even in heaven every teardrop is it's placed in a bottom one of these old days and then then used as a perfume before the Lord that she might walk worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power and to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son he didn't say we're going to be delivered from the power of darkness the Bible said we are delivered from the power of darkness and everytime we take the darkness back we are we we are destroying the work that God has already done Paul said I'm not going backwards I'm not going to rebuild Amen the thing that I have torn down and God is torn down the laws that kept us in bondage right now amen we have one law and that law is love hello that's the law God is working with the bride now it's not touch not taste not handle not it is the l.o.v.e your prophesied that who is my prophet as well are we so busy a minute looking at this and looking at that and we missed the whole picture we can't even love one another because somebody's wearing a different color shark and you don't agree with the shirt that's what people are doing you understand me we patty we look at these things that we are not to be looking at we need to see how much God is developing in that individual and guess what then we need to help each other oh yes the Bobby said you don't even have the Holy Ghost if you can't love your brother I don't care how much you show all these sides and everything else he said it ain't there why because Satan's wisdom his his will brought not only division but brought in hatred because he had a right to hate huh he said what do you mean look what it did here it was those two boys Cain and Abel they were just sacrifice under God brothers come out of the same womb maybe a few minutes apart from one another but all of a sudden Satan manifests his will in his son and that is he wanted to be number one and what happens he kills his brother to make sure he's number one I don't have no competition did you know that and that's exactly what Lucifer trying to do and he's tried throughout the ages and that was and here's two kills God's influence so that he could be number one and right now in this age Lucifer is number one this is Satan's Eden and now he's killed the effect of Jesus Christ almost even among the believers because they have willed they meant to follow his instructions more so than God's instructions we ought to be sacrificed we ought to be crucified is that right Paul said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless not I will not my will not my will not my will let it walk on you let them Trump you whatever they've got to do as long as you know that you are in the will of God oh you got a right that's right and God will never take that right from you but God is far more pleased when you give up your right for his right can you imagine the lord of heaven it meant being persecuted stripped and beaten and the scripture says he was dumb and opened not his mouth hallelujah can you imagine what he went through and he did it all for you and I and if Christ could keep his mouth shut during persecution so can we why because you were there if you were in Christ you have the same ability that he has he was able to ignore all of the negative things said about him ah he had one thing in mind and that was you and I 1 breaking him he had broken one part of that word it would been finished but he kept the word because he was a family man he realized that if he broke the word if he was to ever have children they would break the word to y'all understand me see because he was the original and whatever he would do would was all all lined in his DNA that's why we could never go back to where we used to be because when Adam broke it it literally broke the DNA where Adam was weak we were weak right you are the strength of the tree in which you came from that's why we must be born again we must come from the tree of life in order to stand in these last and evil days in that tree of life is Jesus Christ hallelujah like they oh they say the fruit doesn't fall too far from the tree I don't mind as long as I came from that tree we've been ordained ordained this is our inheritance and I'm not gonna let I totaled evidence this morning and last night I said I'm not gonna let you take my inheritance away from me we can't be taken well Jacob took Esau you understand me but my point is this this is mine God gave it to me he gave it to you and he expects you to reverence and respect what he's given to you hmm oh yes you know when he told you Israel he said Israel I want you to go and over the over the in Canaan and I wanted you to conquer the land he said no but if you don't conquer it he's dead he's saying Devils or will become thorns in your flesh right now the Philistines are thorns in the flesh of Israel we call them Palestinians the same tribe of people that they did not kill and get rid of are now their thorns and the same demons that we know we possess if we don't get before God to get rid of them they will always be thorns in your flesh every time you think you have come to a height or level in Christ that devil will come and slap you down every time it's true the chain is as strong as his weakest link Paul said I die daily that all right oh my he said don't be deceived and a lot of time we are he said but don't be the seed Eva communication corrupts Miss Manners you hang around corruptible people you will soon be corrupted hello oh but these are my friends what are your friends burying what kind of devils and demons they bring into your house and you better understand by God's grace your demons can be transmitted just by with the handshake or giving up something this or that email I've seen it I've experienced it it is okay this age requires one thing we're not an organization we're not a denomination we are Jesus Christ we are the body of Jesus Christ and that's all God wants to see who oh I got a quote just hold up because I'm gonna tell you something the only way we can become Jesus Christ we got to be born of God right the Prophet God said when we're born again we right there at faith hmm I heard him just the other day he said we're not in Laodicea he said we are in Ephesus again you know what Ephesus mean Ephesus is the promise it is the promise of not only the Holy Ghost but a full maturity in Christ it is the Caleb's mountain hallelujah so you and I must understand we are in the Ephesus a we're no longer and what was Ephesus emphasis was not only faith but Ephesus was love - he said how can it be love because remember when the church started the Bible said they sold everything and they distribute it to everybody so nobody would have a need that's love smitten out of laodicea back into the eighth day and people don't want to even believe that but it's true Christ is to be seen in this church not your personality not mine well that's right you say well prove that the Bible said he meant that on now Transfiguration there was Moses and Elijah and said here Peter says all let us make three Tabernacles amen so we can worship them and they said next thing they look around they saw one and that was Jesus Christ only oh I got a quote here where the velum said they went a lot when the properties move off the scene he said it was a pole it's supposed to be Jesus only and we realize it when we're not of Jesus only but he is to be glorified that's why that third pull hit man is not about man is not about even william branham he stood off on the side seeing these things happen and I really believe that when he said I ride this try this trail again he wasn't talking about himself that was God speaking through the man God will ride this trail again but when he does it won't be no personalities it can't be the only personality it will be is Jesus Christ himself there won't be another eighth angel if there is ain't eighth angel is Jesus Christ himself forgive my voice I ate a few breath mints and it just turned my voice but you know I look at this thing you know I want us to see people you that you it it's not a one-man ministry anymore you're the bride of Jesus Christ if the world is going to see Jesus Christ again it will be through you that's why it's so important look at what people are doing what the Spirit is doing because of people's reasoning they're directing people back to the Prophet if they're not directing them back to the Prophet in the sense that now amen they they do away with the ministry that's nonsense that's Antichrist and if they're not doing it there's a friend my I preach that is judge many times there in in South Africa and I saw on the internet the other day it meant they didn't they don't the man got thousands in his church started off with this message and now they got a big old bus with his figure his face and everything on it and they calling him Elohim nonsense that's blasphemy and people well I want you to understand that this is really but I'm being led to say it read your Bible you got to understand there was a lot of prophets children who didn't make it and because their prophets children doesn't make them holy I'm in the scripture where we have we were we were commissioned to follow children and I strayed this not discrediting I've got these people of my friends but you've got to keep your eyes on Jesus you can't turn from him why because the day of man is over this is God's day this is the Lord's Day we've actually moved out earlier this year we enter into what we call an eternal age there's only one setting on the throne and that's Jesus Christ he's the only one and don't get me wrong we're not to forget everything Malachi said we supposed to remember because remember when Joshua came on the scene he said God told Joshua remember everything Moses said that's your key because Moses didn't preach his word he preached the Word of God I don't know why I'm here but I'm here now it's not even in my notes but my point is you and I must understand you're married to the Lord Jesus Christ and when you married to the Lord Jesus Christ he is your headship and you're supposed to communicate with him I love the people of God and you know what I can't tell you what I see only God gives us revelation but I could tell you one thing I know I've been sent by God I understand it the judgment and I know how they give an account for everything I say he but I'm going to tell you something you better fall in love with Jesus Christ you better come to a place where you listening for his voice every day coming from the message what is the Holy Ghost prophet God said the Spirit of God has worked under justification under Luther sanctification on the West day the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is the last day performing and doing the very same things that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one and as soon as they connect together that lastly she she'll go through the sky shouting up with one up will come Wesley Luther and all the rest of them back in those days there he that first would be last and he that last would be first and they will come they will come the resurrection we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification sees just a little shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it is a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of it's very person being in here for me signs and wonders like he did at the beginning hallelujah going back to Peter that we are now partakers of his divine nature so God is now restoring us to the very person each age got a piece of Christ but in this age we must have the full measure Laura Beamer to us is that right he's at glory going to call me Holy Roller anyhow you might as well get started he said listen in the message Amen why are people talked about he said let him hide himself and let him loose let me lose myself and find it Lord in thee let all self be crucified let my neighbor's gossip let all this that or the other begone I go to church for one thing and that's to stay in the presence I am moved in their Lord I never desire to leave it again I'll trust your word what you say there is where I want to be drop the veils around me Lord that I could only see Jesus only and live and walk and die in him there you are on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus stood transfigured before the apostles when they looked up they seen Jesus only they said they'd seen Jesus only standing there oh god hide me in that place hide me over in that place where other veils will drop and I'll see nothing but Jesus himself I don't want to hear the from that net fantasticks of the world I don't care whether they got atomic bombs whether they got a jet plane whether the news new Cadillac's look better than the Buicks all of it doesn't matter the thing of it is I'm walking and living in Christ daily and I've died to self and the veils are dropped around hallelujah and I am in he and he in me hallelujah now you and I must understand these words are not just something that we're going to just drop to the ground he God is an inspector for the Benham says now notice but in this the Holy Ghost is a sign the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God gave to his chosen children children to jury to rejected is to be cut off from the people and to receive it is to be finished with the world and all the things of the world and to be a product that God has put a seal of approval on I used to work on a rail room out here with Harry Walter berry and we would go down onto loaded car my brother dark standing back there helps me load cars when a car is being loaded they go through the car that car the inspector and if he finds anything loose where it would fall and break or anything that would destroy he'll not seal that car until that car is so completely packed until it's so packed down and so in order that the shaking of the ride won't bother the product that's on the inside that's what the matter we don't get sealed so much we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just a little loose about things a little loose about your prayer life little loose about your temper little loose about your tongue to talk about others he'll never seal the car some dirty habit some vile thing some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but when he found everything is in its place in its inspector then he seals it dare be anybody open the seal until that car has reached its destiny to wear is sealed for there it is touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm for I say unto you it is better for you that a millstone has hang at your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the sea than to ever try to a fin or shake a little little on the least of these that's been sealed you see what it means that's what the Holy Spirit is is your assurance is your protector it's your witness it's your seal it's your sign that see I'm heaven bound don't care what the devil says I'm heaven bound why he sealed me he gave it to me he sealed me into his kingdom and I'm glory bound let the winds blow let's say to do what he wants to do God has done seal me till the day of my Redemption hey man that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you should want it I couldn't go on without it so must so much could be said there but I'm sure you know what I'm speaking of now also let us turn to John 14 just a minute I trust love I just love the word it's the truth now the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost what is it what is the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of Christ in you now before we read I just like to say a few comments words here what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost in its spirit of Jesus Christ in you a little while said Jesus and the world what world sees me no more yet you shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world Spirit of God in His Church is that Alright see our desires our desires are to be the bride's desire and that desire is I want to please him hallelujah but not the desire of Esther I want to please me tell me what pleases the king martyr Chaya that's why I want to know what pleases the king so I can act upon it is that right now here's another quote coming from is the rising of the Sun he says now look at Transfiguration we was everyone pre-death up represented there there was a living Saints that had rapture there was a larger standing there there and there stood Moses the dead Saints represented also but both of them had quickening power whether one died or the other one didn't die they are they are there notice oh look what we are now seeing in these last days the same thing that he promised certainly people say you claim to have power no no no we're just like them on Mount Transfiguration see certainly we do not claim power like they was on Mount Transfiguration they wasn't saying Moses say see why right let me see he says on Mount Transfiguration they wasn't saying Moses say see who see who I am right the disciple says see Who I am see who I am no no no no Moses wasn't there Elijah wasn't there to try for you to identify him see Who I am oh sure we're not here in the bride of Jesus Christ so people can see who we are we're not promoting ourselves if you're promoting yourself that's the fluence of Lucifer that's the influence of the denomination of preachers my ministry you got no ministry the only ministry we have is the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ working through us hallelujah oh my god she noticed they seen Jesus glorified that's all they wanted to see represented Jesus glorified and so is it today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what the people say about us our names ain't nothing is his name our life it's nothing it is his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we'd love to do is see him glorified and how can it be when he's glorified in us by the resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was today oh I love my prophet I love that my prophet that's what makes me know that he was a prophet cuz he never glorified himself he always glorified Jesus Christ he tell people I can't heal you if I could do this I would do this but I gotta wait on him Oh can't you do this let's approach him in prayer and see what he says we the one turn this thing around ah because Satan will need to be so because he knew that if we turned around and worship the Prophet we made him an idol and we became idolaters did you get that see our desires not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not boost some church or make some more in Sunday school or try to bring in how hog-tied push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons and something else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorify glorified what not with self pride but in us our lives to prove he's alive and living in us hallelujah can I get another one here coming from the Easter seal he said but we do one thing when they looked around with all this power upon them they saw Jesus only and the real true believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he doesn't care about those things he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified Christ makes difference a real true listen a real true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah it didn't glorify themselves it didn't glorify nothing else but they seen the glorified Christ and in true believers that's what's in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get to the people to see Easter seal 1965 4:10 go listen my last quote see this is what I'm saying cheap things if we're not careful we allow our flesh to be puffed up and when we do you see that's why I ran I've always ran from popularity people make me popular I run from that stuff because I know how her brother branham say brother Graham said it like this he said if the people to push you a prideful you make you and when you sell what they doin even build you up to pride he said God is a jealous God he'll make you fall oh come on somebody I've seen people in this message worship ministers worship and the minister just take it ain't nothing great about us yeah everybody like compliments but you always should always bring Jesus in it ha thank you but if working for the Lord Jesus I wouldn't be nothing you just said it like that and you just you don't say it that way and you just accept all that you know what's going to happen you're gonna get all pumped up and prideful and now you're gonna ruin the anointing we find that on their camp where this great occasion took place up on Mount Transfiguration as Peter later called it the holy mountain where he met with them now I do not believe the Apostle meant that the mountain was holy he meant it was a holy God on the mountain it isn't the body Holy Church it's not the holy people it's not it's it's the Holy Ghost in the people the Holy Ghost is holy he is your director and your leader and we find on this little camp up on Mount Transfiguration when they were commissioned to here the only thing they were commissioned to do was to hear the word only thing they seen was not a Creed they'd never seen nothing else but Jesus and he is the word made flesh and if you're gonna cut these quotes out you might as well cut all of them out these quotes were given to us after the seal and you know I look at this thing and I'm saying it's up to you like I said this morning is simple you make the choice your will versus God's will and I don't know about you but I choose Jesus whatever god has to do to me to kill and destroy every piece of my will I'm saying to you Lord in the witness of all these people so let it be I have no desire to be anything but what God wants me to be and whatever it takes I'm trusting that he'd keep me from being stubborn because all of us have a have their possible you know stubbornness can fall on anybody I don't want to be stubborn I trust that when the word comes to me to correct me that I will humble myself and let God's will be done in my life when God tells me to run I want to run hmm my point is people if you don't put your life in God's hands totally his hands you gonna come up with shipwreck only God can lead you properly you are sheep like and you cannot lead yourself you need a shepherd this is why God brought to me this morning Psalms 23rd 23rd Psalm the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want right he is the one that's leading me through the valley through the shadows of death he's meeting me he's the one that's directed me he's the one that leads me by the still waters and the green pasture don't know what that mean that means a good old revelation he's the one I don't know how to find it but he knows where the pastures are hallelujah and the brother told me in closing he said he'd been there where they lead the Sheep he said you think you know you have all these pastures and everything he said no he said sometimes you got to go through a lot of rough terrain a lot of rough territory you got to go through some some some some ways like two big stones rocks here and you got a you don't even that's why they knew that the thieves would be waiting on the other side just to rob you he said but you have to go through there with that Shepherd trusting I mean a bear or any kind of animal could be right there waiting just to devour but that Shepherd is there to protect you I'd rather have a shepherd I'd rather have him leading me I'd rather say Lord I take your not my own right I hope something came through I just know one thing it is so simple and everybody deals with their will every day all day is that when we come to those things that you and I know that's not Scripture we need to go into prayer especially if you feel that there is no strength Lord I'd be done is that right because Jesus as a man knew he couldn't do it on his own per se Lord not my will but then the Lord sent an angel and strengthened you so you want God to strengthen you in those areas that you weaken you need to say Lord not my will but time he does best in here the praises Oh Yahoo God Almighty principie trouble whoo baby whoo ha ha in the prince oh my in the breath Oh God oh my oh we are standing on holy ground we are stand me on holy ground ooh and I knew that there are angels all around -
