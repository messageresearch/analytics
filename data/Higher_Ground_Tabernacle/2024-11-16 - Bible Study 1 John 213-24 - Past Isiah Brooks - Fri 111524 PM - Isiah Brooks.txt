TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e your mercy in all that you've done for us Lord forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness most of all touch our feble our bodies Lord give us the strength and Lord anoint us oh God to teach or exalt your word tonight and may everyone under the sound of this voice be blessed by you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may turn with us by God's grace to First John please we're going to start the second chapter beginning at the 13th verse 13 we'll try to work our way down to the 24th verse we have been dealing with love loving your brother love is God uh we know what the prophet God said that only Divine love is going to make get we must believe that by the grace of God uh we must receive that and if we receive that we will be as Paul we press toward the mark of a high calling in Christ Jesus first John 2 chapter we'll start reading at the 13th verse I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one 15th verse love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him let us pray once again father we thank you once again for your holy word anoint us tonight give us what we stand in need of we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated um tonight I would just like to uh speak on this journey the two spirits in the church we are uh dealing with what what John John talks about the Antichrist and the Antichrist Spirit already being in the church and we know that the Antichrist anti means to be against um God and and by God's grace we trust that somehow we'll be able to bring this lesson out it is good to know God because this is what John is talking to the fathers to the young people to the young men if you would want to say it like that he's basically addressing the whole church because it's important to know God it's not enough to say well I know him and yet you don't know him um and when we say that we're working with not just a letter of the word we we're talking about the spirit word the quickening word that revelated word uh that we must know him by uh because many many in the days of old couldn't read nor write but they knew the spirit they knew God and you must understand that by the grace of God during the time of the uh New Testament Church uh they didn't have a Bible as we have they of course had the the Scrolls uh that the Jews would read and things like that but when it came to the New Testament Church uh these the church itself uh was um fresh new uh but one of the things that they did have and that was the Holy Ghost and the Bible said the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth when I think about fathers you've known him because you have known him you're talking about an experienced person that have uh had uh not only just the Revelation but they've gone through trial they've gone through Temptations they've gone through a lot of things and they have overcome the wicked one and even John basically he's actually encouraging the young people because they've overcome and when you say overcome you're talking about the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life God has delivered you and so you know the wicked one and you know what he's like turn with me to St John 14 St John 14 we'll we'll read from there St John 148 through2 you love the Lord amen amen St John 14 8 through 20 let's start um at the eth verse where Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us I was talking to a friend of mine who is what we call a denominational Christian uh I believe he is a a Son of God he just doesn't know what we know but I believe as we work with him God will open his understanding you know as like when Paul when they saw the Disciples of John they expounded to them in more excellent way but do you know him um Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and yet has thou not known me Phillip he that H have seen me have seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father so you got to understand there's a lot of Christians who are in the position of Phillip they still don't know who the father is you see they have not come into that Revelation to know that Jesus Christ is the father amen even though he be he is the son only because he was created in the flesh amen but when it comes to his inner being it was God because St John 10:30 Jesus declared I and the father are one so Jesus said to them have you been with me I mean you've seen the Miracles you've seen the works that I've done you've seen it and you know no man can do these things and the 10th verse says believest Thou not that I am in the father and the father is in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work is't that a position to be in to know that every word you speak is coming from the unction of the Holy Spirit the power of God you have no words of your own everything that you say com is coming from the Throne of God what a powerful position to be in and I believe by the grace of God John is writing these things to us so that we can accomplish this so that we can come to that position where God can speak through us even as brother random said the Bride of Jesus Christ is the voice of God Amen for the final age this is the final age and Jesus Christ is supposed to be speaking through us but he can only speak through us if we're dead all right believe thou not that I am in the Father the father is in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the speak The Works believe me that I am the I am in the father and the father is in me or else believe me for the very Works sake Jesus said well uh you know we know that only God can do the works that I've done and if you don't believe I'm here here take an inventory look at the things that I have done and then you'll be able to see the works that have been that have been done is done by the father is that right he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth in on me the works that I do shall he do also so here Jesus himself is basically saying when you come to understand who the father is you have a revelation of him he said the very works that I do you have the same ability amen you will be able it'll be the father working through you right it'll be the father speaking through you right everything you do will be by and of the father I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is pressing into that position sir see because as long as Jesus was saying or doing Miracles uh you know they they didn't do much but when Jesus declared that I and the father are one that's right that's when he stirred the harness Nest that's when everything began to come after him because they said they wanted to kill him and Jesus said why why do you want to persecute me he said because they said unto him because thou being a man make yourself equal with God right and even Paul says it right he said don't don't you know uh don't don't this this is a mystery but he said uh you know uh God was manifested In the Flesh and think it not strange you know he he came down and he took on uh uh the Flesh of God and the Bible said he he saw himself as equal with God and I think that's where we we we fail because we as I said La last night you know or the other night we're so busy judging ourselves according to the outer man and the outer Man is dead God is not concerned about the outer man the outer man is growing old you know all of that but the inner man is the man that God is concerned about he's the one that is growing into the very image and likeness of God and when you can see the inner man you can see Perfection because you know God is perfecting the inner man this thing doesn't change until that time when this Mortal will put on immortality amen you love the Lord okay let's go back to the scripture here all of these things come by Revelation you can study all you want to this is why brother said in that day you'll understand how important Revelation is to the Bride of Jesus Christ you know I um was uh I have been thinking on how important it is for for us to come and accept everything God spoke to us through the prophet brother brandham amen uh uh some of the things that he has said or has been spoken in the natural mind you can't even comprehend it but by faith is how we receive what has been spoken sir is Faith and that faith will work that Revelation the more Revelation you have about who you are the Freer you are amen the stronger you are yes sir right you become as the prophet of God said you and I become an invincible Army amen because that's the way God declared us to be right that's knowing him that's knowing what you come uh uh for to do in this age our age is different from the se you and I must recognize that God is to much whom is given much is required am and I believe that right and he's telling them he's putting them basically in order I know you know this I know you this you the the wicked one you've overcome but then he drops down into the 15th verse he said love not the world why did he say that because if you love the world brother bradam as he described it he said the love of God is not in you amen even if there be a speck of the world world in you he said the love of God is not now that's a powerful statement very powerful listen coming from the message a thinking man's filter paragraph 114 just a little above it he said you can't say that bobbed hair for a woman is of God the Bible says it's not so it's the filth of the world and if you love one Speck of the world the love of God is not even in you what's that well what's drawing it is something down on the inside drawing the soul is drawing your resource through the outside down through through the spirit into the soul and if the soul loves the world it's dead I don't care how it is Anointed it is out here and how righteous it is out here down in here is dead for he that love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in him no matter how religious see what I'm saying so that's the deception of religion religion is is is can be so deceiving coming from the exposition of the seven Church ages brother B says Harvest Time yes Harvest Time the two vines that grow together and intertwine their branches are now to be separated the fruits of those Vines which were at such variance will be gathered GED into a separate Gardener the two Spirits would go to their separate destination and I I I I threw this in there because there's a spirit that love the world and there's a spirit that loves the word amen you understand me and the only difference in in those two words world and word is the letter L which represents lust amen that's right see the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life is of the world Amen Hallelujah but when you free of lust of those things amen it is the word that you live by and not the world that you live by the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now it is time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat bride come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that ye wheat receive not her tears plague the Great Tribulation of the six seal Matthew 24 so what is he saying he's saying now there are two churches one is of God one is not of God but John is writing to the children of God Little Children love not the world or the things that are in the world right discern the two right because there's one amen that's going to love the word and that that other spirit is going to love the world and you can't have two masters you can't love them both you got to you you got to make your choice right and that's that's the thing what we we may not see it but we we got to understand there are examples in the Bible that where people followed God but their their lives their hearts weren't in the place like for example aan and I I took this uh quote coming from the uh the the message um adoption number one 196 0515 and here brother brandham says in paragraph 56 and they slayed the amorites and the Hittites but there was one hurt among there excuse me but there wasn't one hurt among any of them until sin came in the camp amen and when aan took the Babylonian garment and that gold wedge and hid it under his Camp then the next day they lost 16 men Joshua said stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something wrong here we're going to call seven days of fast God made us a promise there will be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere cause we've got 16 dead men laying here and their Israelite brothers and they're dead now what what are you saying brother Brooks we we may not recognize it but I I if we break the chain if we if we as individuals let's put it this way as individuals uh you allow sin to come in and where I'm not talking about faults I'm talking about willful sins a can saw what he did and instead of confessing it he hid it hidden sin don't only just affect you but affects the bride of Christ amen listen what the prophet of God says why did they die innocent men because one man step out of line you see reasons that needs to be taught you see reason that needs to be taught the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God lining up with each other walking perfectly upright and you've heard me say that many times because when you love the world the love of God is not in your heart there is no way that you can love me because the love of God is not there and most of the time you can't even love yourself because the love of God is not there you know even brother Brandon when it comes to Ezekiel he said God will give you a new spirit and many people take that new spirit as though it is the holy spirit but the new spirit is given to you not only to to so you can get along with yourself but also to get along with the word right so when God gives you that new spirit that ain't it you you you like I said last night speaking in tongu shouting and all those things those are just attributes of the Holy Ghost that's not the Holy Ghost acts 238 promis you the gift of the Holy Ghost a gift and many people take that gift as though it's the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost and then you get a gift and the greatest gift that God can give you is himself amen see I know you know fathers you know children children you know young men you know you're strong right because you seen the way you can't fight Satan if you can't seeing that's right you got to see your enemy sir right that's the only way you can Warfare against him if you don't see him you think he's your buddy no you got to see the devil as the devil right oh my see he goes on and says listen the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not have done took the life of 16 men I think it was 16 maybe more I believe it was 16 men that was dead Joshua called and said there's something wrong God made the promise and there's something wrong when he we bring the s up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to the promise and he will do it you understand me what causes the church to fail is men with hidden sin amen You Can't Hide and God will judge every did God judge aen or we get to that in a minute because a lot of time people think if I hide it I'm okay oh no you're causing death unto others amen and he called a fast and he found out they cast the lots and aan confessed it and they killed a can family and all and burned their ashes and left it therefore a memorial and Joshua went out right went right on through the battle a king taking everything without a scratch or a wound there you are you see how powerful the church could be if they loved one another amen if they had the love of God in their heart we would be invincible and when I say that I I'm not even talking about the multitude because every multitude got every church has three kinds of Believers but if we could get the Believers or one Accord a devil no devil would have a place to sit that's right right he said I write unto you the 13th verse I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning and real experienced Christians mature Christians can see the devil a far off they have a discernment they have a discernment and they can see him right they know the enemy from God they know sometime people get a little confused but the longer you stay with God the more you recognize him right because you have the word Martin bowed down before me Martin Martin rebuked the devil why because he had a crown on his head amen that's right you're not Jesus because you are you you you you your your your your appearance is not according to the word because one day we're going to Crown Him and brother said those Pentecostal would have fallen for that but when you know the word amen Satan can dress himself up but you'll be able to discern you'll be able to see exactly who he is I love this I love this God is so good I write unto you little children because you have known the father I have written unto you fathers because you have known known him that is from the beginning woo that's a powerful thing you know even even uh uh uh Jude and the rest of them Luke and all of them you know we we've handled him can you imagine can you imagine and then Paul comes along and says we know we no longer know him after the flesh but now after the spirit which is more powerful that's right which is more powerful y'all y'all believe that because you know Jesus did get tired amen that was the Flesh of God but the man on the inside never weary I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one you're strong why because the word of God abideth in you amen that's how come you're strong not on your own it is the word that abides in you right that makes you strong love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of God of the father is not him uh in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and so therefore if we're fighting and struggling with those things what we need to do is ask God to just what let us die kill us I'm talking about spiritually now we're not talking about some kind of suicidal thing but I'm saying ask God to kill us kill this flesh kill these worldly desires you say well what what do you mean the darkness that's hiding in you because you know James said when we're drawn away we're drawn away with our own lust and entice right that's what's in you and and the Holy Spirit is is the only one who could burn all that out of you get rid of it right that doesn't mean you won't have a fight here but the inner man will be stronger than this Hallelujah the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever think about that what an encouraging letter little children it is the last times and as you have heard that the Antichrist shall come even now are there many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time so what are you saying Antichrist is the kind of person is the kind of spirit that'll keep you from rejoicing that'll keep you from praising God that'll keep you from living right that'll make you starchy that's Antichrist God there's nothing starchy about God God is full of life he's not a statue he's a living being Hallelujah and and we must be that way the way when we find you you got to understand he said you're either hot or cold that's right when you see a fire a fire dances amen a fire move it it it doesn't stay in the same place you could see it just moving around fire lives but when you allow yourself to cool off or to become lukewarm that's a condition where you have been you have been influenced by the spirit of the Antichrist and they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been us for been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of us so when people fall away it's be from the word without a real cause and I can truly say that there is no cause great enough to leave God Amen that's right nothing and when you see that everything is given to you by Grace you going to leave that your deliverance your healing your joy everything you receive from God is because he gives it to you because he loves you and it's not because you got to work for it it's all Grace yet people want to leave him and they fail to see that even when they leave him he still takes care of them amen that's right yeah I I don't get it I just don't get it because a lot of people don't understand that every Every Breath You Take that was God every move you make that's God every thought you think that's God God operates everything he's in control why not serve him I've been thinking about this thing more now than ever am and I think about what is worth like like I preach what your soul what is your soul worth brother B say this you know your soul is worth 10,000 worlds whatever that might be or may be and I think to myself my soul is the most important thing to me than anything you understand me because this this boy has only one chance at it that's right and I just don't love anything more than I love my soul now I'm not talking about God I'm talking about my soul because God is number one but I want my soul to recognize that God is number one amen that's right my soul need to know that my God God is the one who created this thing amen my soul need to worship him my soul need to live for him amen my soul need to do everything he says do yes sir cuz he's worthy of it right then you when you know him ah my God as I said there's no way to get There's No Escape how you going to escape it's best to be on the Lord's Side that okay coming from the message exposition of the church but what do we have in this hour this our hour our day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word or of a true move of the spirit of God if they see blood or of fire they are happy it matters not what is in the word they will support any sign even scriptural ones even unscriptural ones but God has warned us about that he said in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two spirits will be so close together that only the very elect could tear them apart for they alone will not be deceived amen we're not deceived with the pleasures of the world we understand that this the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the glory that God has in store for us we're not deceived we know him amen we know him and I'm going to tell you something the greater part is he knows us hallelujah how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test if they don't speak the word they are of the evil one as the evil as the evil one deceived the first two Brides They will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get her to hbr herself through Creeds or just plainly turn from the word to any sign that suits her God never said believe the sign God said believe the word amen but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah took the woman told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord and when she did as the word said the prophesying came come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word energizes energized by the spirit you say oh what do you mean brother Brooks because I'm going tell you something when this final op pouring of the Holy Spirit Falls is falling on everybody y'all understand what I mean I mean the weed and The Tear amen and The Tear is going to think that they are on in a Revival that's right and can't you see this thing Moun up now that's right it's mounting up now you're going to either believe the message or you don't believe the message but we know where the Antichrist system is amen right if it's Antichrist so how can how can can this Antichrist system be a a a Christian system when it's against Christ amen one of these old days the people going to find out who they are worshiping that's the word from the prophet that's right right because the only way you can worship God is that you worship Him in spirit and in truth everything else is Antichrist if you whether you want to believe it or not that's it this is why God sent us a message that we might know the truth and the truth will set us free make us free rather right according to the 20th verse of that same chapter but ye have an unction from the Holy One and you know all things right so what is he saying listen let me tell you something this message has placed us in a position to know all things amen that's right we know what's coming amen we know the Antichrist Spirit we know the system we know what the mark of the beast is we know what the Holy Ghost is we know it's not the third person it's the person it is God himself we know it's not a feeling or speaking in tongues it's a lifechanging experience that brings you into the glory of God by glory glory glory glory amen literally maturing you into the very image and likeness of God that's him right that unction that makes you thirst for more God Amen that's God that's not the devil the devil won't make you thirst for God that's god making you thirst for him and if there's a deep call there's a deep to respond right he said I have not written unto you because you know not the truth you know the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth so who can who can deceive you when you know the truth the word of our our day has given us the truth what doct doctrate of divinity whoever it may be can deceive you amen and you don't even have a ldd or Masters or whatever you're simple amen but you know God amen it's almost like the woman you know when at the well said we know when the Messiah comes he's going to tell us these things well you know even the Pharisees and the Sadducees of that day didn't know the truth like she did amen what was that it was given to her by Revelation and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you know the truth John says and I love this thing because it's an unction it's something God giv gives you you can't even explain it but you know it who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ that's right he is Antichrist that denieth the father and the son woo when you denied that Jesus is the Christ he said you're denying the father and the son and whosoever Deni the son the same have not the father why can't these Trinity and see this but he that acknowledge the son haveth the father also why cuz Jesus said it in in St John 10:30 I and my father are one they can't figure out that Oneness they think it's like this but it's greater than your finger is that right amen you're striving to be what one with God now remember this Christ is the trueu now remember this this is a new quote Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts and like I was telling people people thought that the book of Acts stopped hundreds of years ago but even during the time of of persecution that was the book of Acts because no man could have done those things what man you know is going to want run to the face to face a lion that's right what mother or whoever is going to let you just take them and burn them at the stake without a fight that was God knowing god because you if you don't know God you that can't be done that's right fear overtakes you wonderment wonder what's going to happen to me when I die but when you're certain of God and you know him by spirit and by letter amen you become an invincible Army amen it still balls down back to love you got to love God with all of your heart with all your mind with all of your soul but the Book of Revelation shows how that this Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless huh the Antichrist Spirit comes to make it lukewarm form more and Powerless why do you think the preachers preach so hard against it in this church because we recognize the spirit that got people formal the people that got people starchy that's not Christ that's Antichrist amen it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destructions of God people and the discrediting of God's word right right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation see he keeps saying true Revelation not some partial uh uh uh uh How could a hrid revelation of God of who you are a true revelation of the two Spirits within the frame workor see because a lot of time Christians those who are true Christians they become they get intimidated by these uh spirits of antichrist when people amen you're rejoicing you having a a great time in God and and the anti Spirit Tri spirit is looking at at you like you in insane amen that's right and that happens in our own church you can't even Rejoice without somebody trying to discern whether that be of God well I know when you don't Rejoice am that's not of God that's right I got enough experience with that enough discernment of that you say well I'm not emotional you're a liar all men are emotional sometime we just lock down in our own little selves but everybody cry everybody laughs when you get happy you smile so what do you mean you're not emotional you just won't re you don't Release Yourself to the holy spirit for the joy that you could receive and wonder why we do that people say well I can't do it that's not true it can be done when I was in the world I didn't I didn't I I I had a desire to dance when I wanted to dance I danc then after I dance I start feeling good come on that's right people people you know I'm not saying everybody got to dance everybody got shouted but emotionally but how can you how can you have it you got to have it somewhere lot of times we're locked into ourselves maybe because of past experiences I don't know but God wants that how can God says you it's a joy it's a the Holy Ghost is a joy overflow it's a it's a well of water springing up you know and that means you have no control of it it comes out but we can't allow ourselves to be locked down because a spirit fears what people going to say I've seen people are afraid of the holy spirit because they were afraid to get out of control God is saying that's what I want I want you out of control I want to be in control of you she will be an invincible Army if they they get a true Revelation see she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as de definitely toward it today as when Christ withstood his very every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them let me say it like this even if you don't feel oh I don't you know what a sacrifice of praise is is when you give it and you don't feel it you don't feel like it but you Hallelujah anyway something causes you to praise God God I was listening to something to and I remember back in the day you know there were when when when the Pentecostal Church in America many of the preachers didn't know how to read so they had their wives or someone else read the scripture you know brother brandham used to have his wife read the scripture and he said read and she' read it and he'll preach and he get they call it preach and praise because while he's preaching he praised God glory to God something happens to him while he's preaching he catched the revelation of the scripture and then he praised God in between it's been a long time since we've seen that but nevertheless that's the way it used to be and people used to be so spiritual during that time they can tell when the devil enters into the church oh oh see we don't know but we we see what what they call Pentecostal now that ain't it all that shouting and carrying on people were far more serious-minded back then when the Holy Ghost moved he moved right even so in this message that's the way it was right let me move on Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the gates of hell can not Prevail against us but we will prevail against uh Prevail over them you know why I'm saying this all of this can only be done when you know him you got to know him you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the book this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his works in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give up Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing things two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is good it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instructions not just a student comparing verses with verses though that is good but a mystery required the teaching of the spirit or it'll never become clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know and how you come to do that you come to do that through prayer amen prayer you got to pray whether you feel it or not that's what you need to do now certainly everything that God has Satan has something to counterfeit it see he makes something off of it and Jesus did preceed their thoughts so therefore the great Orthodox of those days said that guy is the best fortune teller in the country he's bebov the prince of the devil is that right now that's what the preacher said and the great teachers of that day said he's be elbel now let me let's see what the devil said the devil said he's a Son of God you know who you are the Holy One Of God is that right right and that case the devil had more knowledge of God than the ministry did and it's still the same here God has sent a message in this day and 90% of the Ministers of the world maybe more than that call this message the devil and all this message is the truth amen but that's the difference between the two you can say this message is of God you are of God hallelujah and here's what the preacher says they're Impostors they turned the world upside down they're no good there was the ministry saying they're Impostors and the devil saying these men of God which was right see the devil was right is that right sure he was so you see even uh them people so that was from I am the resurrection so when we look at these things we must understand by the grace of God that when when this whole entire how can I say it coming to know God and coming to know how can I say it in order to know God you must be willing to die because Jesus said take up your cross and follow me and the only way you can uh follow Jesus you you must die amen that that that's it you must die you must die to yourself right you must die to yourself and when we see that we can die to ourselves God can then come in and really give us what we stand in need of ah and he says listen you out of yourself you R you you do away with the things of the world the 25th verse says and this is the promise that he have promised us even eternal life hallu is it worth it it's worth it let me ask you a question how many of y'all know you're alive how you know it how do you know you're alive you could be dead you know why cuz everything about you signifies that you're alive when somebody is dead he can't move he can't talk he can't worship nothing he can't do nothing nothing he can't say hallelujah he can't say praise the Lord he can't say thank you Jesus he's dead but when somebody is alive he can speak he can worship he can give God praise he can give God glory right and he knows it's not coming from his head but his heart let's stand are we grateful that the anointing of God abides in and I'm going to say this to you once again the Bible said you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you brother Adam talks about it but I said if a man want to dance woman whoever it may be God will give that to you I put it this way if you ever danced in the world you can dance in Jesus the gift is already there singing it's there but you got to use it die and move that thing to the right side you know when you dance for the the devil is on the left move it over to the right we were at basketball games football game oh we shouted that's on the left side move that Cher to the right huh amen you think about you say what a minute Jes the Pentecostal Church hadn't even started but when Jesus rode into Jerusalem those people went woo they were breaking down the people Lawns and tearing up their trees breaking and palm trees and waving them hosana hosana I mean it must have been a mess amen blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord there was that was what even that that Humanity something about that knowing who that he was amen inspired them to worship knowing who he is it will inspire you justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Seal of God all these things are steps and levels of God in you but you don't stop you go for go for what you want Lord this is what I want it's almost like Esther when she wanted something from the King she just didn't sit at the house she said no no no no i' this is urgent this is urgent if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king and that's what we need an urgency in Us in order to make us move forward but remember the Antichrist spirit is everything against God and often times we all allowed allow it to anoint us is that right whether we want to realize it or not it's true you know you know we you I don't feel like praising the Lord today who did tell who when the Angels before God can't stop and and we come to church I don't feel like it is that Christ or anti okay that's all I'm saying cuz the devil don't want you to praise the Lord but he don't mind you praising him let's pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for all that you've done for us Lord just we don't want to be like a can we don't want a pull from the world to remain if there wherever the darkness is we pray Lord that you Deliver Us from it Lord we want our Temple to be holy Sanctified Fire full of the Holy Spirit Lord in our minds you you know our thoughts are far off cleanse us even in our spirit our minds let our souls be pure before you Lord father we can't do it you're the maker you're the master builder you're the Potter we're the clay but father we desire desire to be perfect we desire to be in your image in your likeness we desire that joy unspeakable full of glory and Lord whatever that may be in our lives that may be clogging up the flu hindering us from worshiping the way we so desire or praising you the way we so desire we pray father God that to cleanse us of these things let the fire of your Holy Ghost oh God Purge us from all worldly things worldly
