Set Me Free amen let's give God a round of applause man surely God is good to us amen amen we're just going to get right into the word amen I'm so glad that Jesus Set Me Free amen I was talking with our brother Keith after service and he said something and I know I'm just going to Bear witness I didn't say anything to him this e this morning uh but I do want to say this in my studying on yesterday uh may have been this morning uh the the the expression the last call it did enter my heart my mind on titling my message and I remember thinking Lord but I don't know whether that be so but then Keith May mention something about the last call this after service morning service and uh so I looked it up a little bit today and uh you know this message is the last call but I want to say could it be that we're now into what is prior to the Rapture the last call uh think about it because at a time of the Rapture and I keep going back to miss lot cuz she turned and then Jesus said there'll be two in the bed two in the feet feel see that was the last call When Miss lot turned that was at the time God would Rapture a church so we're looking at a time let me let me put it this way there's no turning back and uh you can't be so concerned by others that's right or for others you you want to bring them but remember amen to turn and brother Ram said it like this he said uh Miss lot God didn't even give her her a name but she had children down there loved ones down there and she had a right to turn there was something that made her turn but the order was not to look back so that's where we are I I believe that with all my heart and I hope and trust that you would take this in a real serious manner uh that if you've been unstable wishy-washy whatever you want to say uh now is to girdle up the loins of your mind it's it's now to be sober it's now time for you and all of us uh myself to be more serious about God than ever before you will not get another opportunity there are pulls and these pulls will either pull you up or down now it's time for you to make your choice amen turn with me now to 2 Chronicles 7:14 and by the grace of God I trust you and I uh you'll be blessed uh with the message amen I believe that God was here this morning and I believe that the Lord is here now amen uh is that all right you know we have a sure word of Prophecy we we're not guessing at this thing it's it's been proven it's been it's been time tested now I don't know what next year is going to bring uh but you better believe it you're going to have to be a better Christian next year than you are now amen it's not going to get better it's going to get worse that's the day we're living in amen amen coming from 2 Chronicles 7:14 it reads If my people which are called by my name amen should humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land hello somebody if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land so watch this because they are the these people who are called by God's name still are the reasons we're the reason for the season amen is that right amen now listen because you know you and I can't flirt and hang with the world without being changed Psalms 90 And1 you love the Lord surely God is good to us and uh oh I I love this 90 and one and this is a fresh scripture to me I'm sure I've read it before but 90 and one reads the Lord Lord thou has been our Dwelling Place in all generations amen there is no other Dwelling Place amen the Lord has been our Dwelling Place from the time is started to the ending of of time from generation to generation and all generations the Lord has been our Dwelling Place one more scripture Psalm 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen I will say of the Lord he is my re refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust amen that's delicious let us pray father God we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us uh God we thank you for being presence here this evening Lord break and destroy the yolks of the enemy father take down oh God every wall that Satan may have put up Lord uproot every demon every devil everything that's not right amen this is our year of Jubilee Hallelujah this is our time to go free father God give us the grace to drop every hole every rake every hold everything Lord God that's not like you Lord granted in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated now whether you believe it or remember or not brother brandom talks about he's said the greatest bomb shelter that God had ever given Amen to the Bride of Jesus Christ is under the shadow of the almighty Wing almighty God Wings is that right how can we be sheltered by feathers but God Amen is omnipotent and God can do exactly what he wants to do now we said this morning amen we were working with uh still working with the end time the Jubilee amen showing by the grace of God our time amen is almost over it may listen basically everything has been practically fulfilled we're now we're now you said well the the the the only last thing and and I wrote that down brother bam said it like this he said he said just like he did the Jews with the Jews he showed a great measure of Grace to them making his last call so that the unbeliever will blaspheme the Holy Ghost and be worthy of the condemnation they're fixing to receive so what God is doing he's giving us extra Grace ain't that wonderful amen that here we are in this last day amen but the grace in which God will give us will also cause the unbeliever to blaspheme the Holy Ghost why because we're living in an intellectual age we're living in an age where people think that you can literally just work your way to heaven amen but we realize amen it's not by works is not he that willth nor he that run itd who shows Mercy Hallelujah and we showed you this morning amen how that the Lord said said amen even in his word amen that his grace would be sufficient for us is that right let me say it like this every animal you've heard me say this before every animal Amen in Noah's day did not feel the poor that's right amen if you're feeling the poor that means you are elected of God you've been chosen of God Amen to make a trip Hallelujah if you're feeling the poor come on somebody why the because there are so many people in the world who are not feeling the poor amen but if you're feeling the poor amen that means God is still dealing with you and he hasn't cut the cord yet hallelujah amen listen what Jesus did and I've got to go back to Calvary for a moment what Jesus did was triumphant it was something no one else could have done remember amen that Jesus was able to heal the sick but remember even in the Old Testament there was healings in the Old Testament there were Miracles come on somebody amen so Israel had seen and had on their records histories of healings and deliverances and miracles and so when Jesus came to do what he did yes it was a wonder it was a all it was refreshing but Israel knew that Jehovah God could do it but something Jesus did that Moses didn't couldn't do and Joshua couldn't do and none of the other prophets who were great could do Jesus said he said he said I lay this life down amen and I'm going to pick it up hallelujah hallelujah he said listen he said because see nobody else has seen this it was even job's question if a man die shall he live I need to understand this Resurrection because listen the only the only one who could do this would be God hallelujah amen so we realize by the grace of God when Jesus came he was different from all the other prophets because none of these the other prophets could declare this none other could say I'll lay it down and I'll pick it up Hallelujah he said no man taketh my life I'm going to lay it down and I'm going to pick it up is that all right so this in itself made the disciples Wonder Could It Be could this really be the one now listen they had heard him say a many things they couldn't understand and they they pondered in their hearts and even on the day after the resurrection they're there're talking oh my we really thought he was one we really thought he was the one I remember when he said this that and the other but look he's been dead three days Hallelujah and all of a sudden the stranger come walking down the road oh my God Amen and began to join themselves to him and he began to act like a stranger he said what are you talking about he said they said have you been a stranger around Jerusalem and you don't know what's going on this man we thought would be the Messiah amen wo that must have pierced Jesus heart this man we thought would be the Messiah he he we we we believe in him we followed him we left everything but they killed him and he's been dead in the grave three days Jesus began from Moses all the way up Hallelujah he started from the Old Testament and began to preach Jesus amen the Christ Hallelujah the resurrection and the Bible tells us amen that he began to open their understanding to the scriptures and the Bible says Ah when it came to the end he pretended as if he would go and They begged him to stay see that's what Jesus want you to do right now he's been acting like he going to leave us but he he he want us to beg in this stay be oh God please stay Hallelujah and we find out that when when that happened amen he went on and he began to have supper with him and continued expounding the scriptures but something happened he broke the bread bre I don't know how much light was in there but somehow they must have saw the nail pierced hands oh God they must have seen something that reminded them of the day before they captured him he sat down he broke the bread and said this is my body this body will be broken for you Hallelujah my blood this is my blood drink you all of it this is my blood this is the Covenant that I'm giving unto you somehow when their eyes were open he vanished no doubt within their hearts they said surely is he he said he would raise up Hallelujah come on somebody now remember they were really wondering all of them were wondering even Thomas Thomas said don't bring me no bad news I don't want to hear all of this stuff this fanaticism Jesus raised from the dead I was there I saw what he looked like and you trying to tell me he's living I won't believe it until I thrust my hand into the wounds Hallelujah I thank God for the door he says I am the door Hallelujah so he didn't need no other door the door walked through the door Hallelujah and said here I am the door is open thrust your hand and I could see him put his hand in his side and he falls to his knees and said oh my Lord and my God what was he doing he was literally solidifying his death burier Resurrection he was increasing their faith by appearing to them and allowing them to see I am alive and well come on somebody that's what brother random did he didn't preach a dead Jesus he preached a living Jesus Christ Hallelujah and he made him visible amen so that the people's Faith would be United and strengthened to see that the Jesus of the Old Testament a Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new and he's still alive and well amen you got to have a testimony you personally have to have a testimony whether it be like Phillip whether it be like Thomas whether it be like Peter you've got to have a personal testimony to know that he's alive amen not with somebody else but with you amen is that all right listen he said listen go tell he says you're not tired to nothing you're only bound to the bonds of Love don't let nobody tell you that you're free in this nation you're not free you're never free you're either a bondslave to Christ and his love or the devil hello you either bondslave the Christ or the devil that's right you a slave to the devil and his things or you a slave to something I'm glad to be Christ's slave crucified to the things of this world yet I live amen not I but Christ liveth in me if the people could only see that if they could only open their hearts and see that it's back to the Bible back to Christ back to the Cross back to the gospel yes sir Hallelujah the power of the Cross come on somebody that's the gospel amen all of the great Mysteries are great but what good are they without the demonstration of the power of the Cross am some of us may sit here and don't even know we're saved amen and he had already saved us am Hallelujah said Brothers when did he save me I can't tell it he saved you before the foundation of the world you concept it or you're not but that's when he saved you amen there's always some doubt in Thomases Hallelujah but he still was in the bunch Hallelujah I love that glory to God now look at this amen because listen he said he goes on to say uh yes that's what it is oh blessed be the name of the lord the devil seen the church go off on a great big TR tantrum we are the assemblies we are the Church of God we are the Oneness we are the Tess and amen see that he said all these other things why didn't you stay the way you were why didn't you stay the way God provided for you amen even in this old this message we call message there's a cream of the cream of the crop everything that call themselves a follower of the message is not of the message you say what do you mean two million followed Moses Hallelujah come on somebody they were able to follow Moses but they never reached the promised land which was the Holy Ghost Hallelujah come on somebody they followed him but they died in the wilderness murmuring and complaining Hallelujah he said the biggest mistake Israel ever made when great had already provided them a prophet provided them a lamb given them the greatest Revival they ever had and was standing on the shores of the Dead Sea dancing in the spirit singing in the spirit having a jubilee in Exodus 19 they didn't want that they wanted a theologian that they could argue about that's right they was only about four days away from the promised land the same mistake that our Pentecostal fathers made not long ago so he goes on and he ties it that's why we're still here they organized it they wouldn't let the Holy Spirit move oh come on somebody oh we don't do like that among this church come on some I don't care if you do Somerset flips and everything else as long as the Holy Ghost got you doing it you still ain't out of order like brother said to me when I get to heaven I'll be throwing my crown down anyhow Worthy is a lamb Hallelujah Worthy is the Lamb Hallelujah that's when you're going to see a real Holy Roller Hallelujah I'll be acting like Ezekiel will in the wheel amen hallelujah glory to his name listen he goes on and says that's right they was only about four days away from the uh uh Promised Land the same mistake that our pentecost's father made not longer how little would you couldn't have told them that that they was 40 years from the pro land they had to go get something that could they could argue about what did God do to them he left them in the wilderness for 40 years I'm saying something here one day God said you've been in this mountain long enough let's rise and go north and take the promise why North brother cuz that's where the Throne of God is it is in the north and that's why the devil said I shall asend above the [Applause] Stars in the north H come on somebody amen even scientists know that 40 years Israel Fighters God had to let them Live to Die amen 40 years millions of people died still falling Moses but was dead Hallelujah still following the prophet but was dead why they never agreed with him I'm not talking about the ones who agree with him I'm talking the ones who don't didn't agree no sir they all had their own interpretation naan and cor and all the rest of them and they died in the wilderness amen like figure if they the fighters of the Old Testament if they had to die and we're in the Third Exodus amen we had Fighters amen and all of them dying the big ones are already gone come on somebody so if that be the truth it's time for the the people of God to unite as a new generation glory to God as a new generation to cross over because we believe the prophet's message why in 2012 I asked the Lord I say 40 years versus 50 why 20 cuz uh 2012 amen was the 49th year seven sabbaths amen 49 they couldn't couldn't last to the to the last one because in the 50th it could it caus for rest no man's labor on this one the fields got to go wild oh my let them grow up wild Hallelujah let them grow up wild no man controlling this oh my God let them grow up wild he says let the strangers come and eat of it Hallelujah let whosoever will let him come let him come let him eat of it my God people look where we are but right now this generation what we need is a repentance cuz I'm going to tell you something they could could just cross over Jordan they had to sanctify themselves and you can't sanctify yourself until you repent until you confess listen God

expanding amen cuz God never said stop Hallelujah stop still exploding stuff still creating stop Universe after Universe we're talking about eternity who knows you might have your own Galaxy to you amen I just thought I'd throw that one in but you never know what God has in his mind the Bible said it hadn't even entered in our hearts is that okay listen where was I amen 9110 he said there shall no evil be fall thee neither shall any plague Come N thy dwelling place now if you don't know the word of God how are you this word right here when the Trials come when when the when the when everything falls the the the collapse and you still here per Adventure what you going to say that ain't for me God gave me the experience of that we had a bad ice storm in Lima everybody's house electricity went out around my area everybody every time mine would flick I said there's light and go amen word spoken amen and my church and my house I don't know how God did it was the only light in the area because I refuse to let the Judgment of God affect my house I don't know whoever else's light was on but I know mine was and every time time the devil thought he was going to take it out I said uh uh uh there was light and ghost Hallelujah God could be speaking Li but I'm under the blood Hallelujah even in Psalms 23 says yay do I walk through the valley I will what fear no evil amen so what's coming let it come I'll fear no evil amen why my God is in control like they say it's like pharaoh and God said unto Moses wh why cry speak what you crying for you got the power in your hand Hallelujah stretch out that Rod Hallelujah come on it's in the mouth amen the listen the seven seal just didn't open up Mysteries to you it brought the word back to you not just to you but in you the same word Adam have you got it if he's in you amen amen the Tree of Life hallelujah amen the tree of life is in you the spoken word has always been the Original Seed the Lord told me show me that I said that's right Lord I said I I didn't I didn't muster it up but when that dog came after me I called on the name of Jesus that dog stopped in his track see I know that to be true amen but my point is this if God can show you things like that what about now what about when you was getting ready to hit somebody or somebody was getting ready to hit you and you say Jesus and it stopped going to die what do you think law said it was supposed to side but God stopped it you didn't see it but there were some angels said hold it up glory to you don't believe me it's true said Lord open up gahaz eyes he said listen I'm going tell you something about the children of God there are more of us than the the of it looked like the enemy got us got us got an advantage to us cuz it just look like you but you understand the royal family never leaves home by itself the royal family always have an authoriz the royal family always have the angel of the Lord encamped about it I don't know how he can be with me and be with you at the same time but the Bible said so ameno come on somebody now listen talking about healing your land it mean means healing your territory is that all right healing your Commonwealth healing your nation Hallelujah the people of your land healing bringing healing and think about it we get in order Even in our own house what God will do amen he'll heal the land amen listen what the Bible says in Proverbs 13:21 evil pursueth sinners evil demonic power pursues you you don't have to go to it it will come to you let me say it again the Bible says according to Proverbs 13:21 evil pursueth Sinners but to the righteous good shall be repa y'all know what that means payday never ends repaid amen amen but it says evil pursue Sinners so you don't have to worry you don't have to go looking for the Devil the devil coming after you woo devil leave me alone come on get get real let's get stronger than that Hallelujah listen I don't know how much time I got but let me move on Genesis 18:20 the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and gomor is great and because their sin is is very Grievous now I I'm reading this because I'm I'm going to tell you what I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know let me say it like this you know why California had such a bad earthquake what was that in 1906 or right in that time because they rejected that message the church rejected and God sent judgment almost what the greatest earthquake that the California basically had already now my point is whenever a nation rejects the word judgment comes most of all when the church rejects the word right so now let let let's put it this way but we did not start seeing flying Sorcerers or UFOs until that time of 1946-48 during that time they start appearing why because Israel had now become a nation and so when Israel became a nation it was declaring the end of time and God said when Israel become a nation you will see signs in the heavens come on somebody you'll see some UFOs unidentified yo the sea will roll he said now listen when these things pick up when earthquakes in divers places when it pick up he said n the time ain't yet he said this is the beginning of sorrow in 1962 brother brandham declared was the year of the beginning of Sorrows 62 look how it's escalated in 1963 amen the women vote came and voted in a a president a Ricky come on amen amen one of the youngest president come on he was an adulterous he he had a a mistress by the name of Marilyn Monroe and you think they'll be hiding that now they got it in magazines like it's all right it wasn't all right then it's not all right now amen hallelujah then they looked at Clinton like he was a wicked man no sir the seed was already sown think about it you look at Clinton and Kennedy they look so much alike to me Same Spirit all he did was was the Harvest of what was planted in 1963 hello somebody you said we're not at the end of the road yes we are because the Bible says amen that at the time of the children's oppression in Egypt There Rose a f aroh that knew not Joseph amen but that was a good sign because that was the sign of Exodus that was the time they was getting ready to leave out of here and now we have come to a place where we have a pharaoh a a king he's not a president he's a dictator he's a pharaoh yes sir he's calling the shots and he don't know Joseph that's right he has no idea of the supernatural that took place in America he don't know about this Christianity come on somebody he don't know but he looks at you and say we're going to have to stop these these uh these uh Holy Rollers these Fanatics cuz we don't stop them they're going to outgrow us what do you think the stage is being set for the stage is all about you the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the whole stage is set up for you to get you out of here hallelujah come on God is a god of contrast is that right he can't show off his bride till there be a certain amount of Darkness amen hallelujah she's the light of the world come on somebody so there's got to be a certain amount of Darkness that got to be the contrast not of the world of the church he said the he listen he said if the Pentecostal Church would last a hundred years he said from now back in that day he said they' be worse than worse than the Catholics tell me they're not now now they're worse amen huh come on they look just like them same kind of robes same kind of outfits same kind of beads same kind of everything same kind of DDD ldds come on somebody but now they have their own Pope they call him the bishop huh oh y'all y'all looking at me like I'm crazy they got them in the message they they don't want to say it but that's

do and all of a sudden you feel like you empty weak and Satan to use that c say all that praying you doing ain't doing no good don't you believe that lying down brother say when conditions get worse that means it's getting better come on it takes sometimes a hard way to break some of these Spirits off of people amen he said brother Brooks are you insane maybe I am but I'm G to say it like this there's a brother I forgot his name up there at Brother Ray Ericson's church amen who had AE his sister had been in the message had witnessed to him all those years he was a wealthy rich man businessman and he contracted AIDS he's on the bed dying now hospice and the Lord brought a brother in and witnessed to that man that man received God gave his life to the Lord and God healed him from

homosexual disease it's not anymore it's everybody got it oh Lord huh that's God you don't know what God done gave you Grace to escape and you ought to be on your knees praising God for it right now you can't sit up here proud and knowing the wickedness you've done amen and God is offering you Grace and you you sping it you pushing it away that's nonsense that's demon power that got you in bondage amen and God is calling for repentance sir amen If my people they would you called by my name hallelujah amen you know all that is is homosexuality ain't nothing but a demon in your brain right making you think one thing that you're not amen and God can cast out that demon out of your brain come on somebody that's where it is you got Demons of everything demons hear that and demons back there in your brain amen amen that ain't in my notes that's from God and God is pleading with somebody here Romans 82 I don't need to know what nothing I'm just saying that's between you and God you know you can't sneak and peek and you can't go around doing things like thank God don't know when you're doing it God know what you're doing you know you can you can only play Russian Roulette so long before you reach the real bullet y'all still love me amen I hope so because that's the only way you gonna make it Romans 82 Deuteronomy 8:2 amen and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his Commandments or no and he humbl hum thee and suffer thee to hunger and fed thee with man what God said I'm doing this I did all this I allow the devil to send you through all those trials just to see whether you'll keep my word that's right y'all better say Amen y'all I got so many I don't know what kind of looks y'all looking at me but y'all better God knows what's what's going on now you sure what brother BR I shouldn't you should what let me ask you something what do you think those angels went down to Sodom and preached oh y'all come on now y'all it's going to be really nice over here no sir he brought judgment he said if you don't repent and get up out of this situation you going to die and the fire of God is going to catch you amen I know I love everybody in here you know I don't pick on nobody but I know what God can do I done seen too many miraculous things amen right now Deuteronomy 8:6 therefore Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of waters of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and Hills a land of Wheat and barley and Vines and thig trees and Plum granat a land of oil oil and honey a land wherein Thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shall not lack anything in it huh come on somebody and when something look like it's going to lack you need to take God to the word amen take him to the word a land whose stones are iron and out of whose heels thou make may his big brass when thou has eaten and art full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this day what's good for the goose is good for the gander and like I said in closing Israel cried God sent us a deliverer we need the deliverer you know Abraham promised us a deliverer and God sent it where are you Lord send us deliverer God sending Moses God sent Moses it wasn't what they wanted see when God sent William brandom is not what the world wanted they wanted an Elijah but they wanted an Elijah that was going to come through the Assembly of God or the Church of God or the Pentecostal assem some kind of something amen but he wasn't a member of none of them amen come on even though he call them brothers he wasn't a member of none of that but that's not what they wanted they wanted somebody they can brag on he came out of our assembly y'all hear what I'm saying that's what he did that's where the Pentecostal is everybody like brother said every Everybody you had one assembly that come out and he had a little boy by the name of David they called him Little David he was a preacher and all of a sudden all of the Church of God and Christ and all of them had little Davids yeah it ain't nothing for jealousy May the real David stand up because that's the way it is in the message one person get over here eight Angel then they got to have an eighth Angel they got to have an eighth angel I got one too but it's Jesus Christ Hallelujah come on people in this message messed up they think the prophet's Children Are Holy don't talk about it but that's that's the truth the prop children got to be born again just like me all we've got to do is love them regardless to what condition they in but they got to meet Jesus for themselves amen and people are so like something goes over and you say something no that's wrong amen well you going to listen oh listen God never told me to listen to The Prophet son God told me to listen to him amen the word of the Lord comes by the word amen saying I'm just saying this cuz I'm hitting the spirit here and I don't know where it is but let me tell you something ain't ain't nothing holy but the word amen and this word is enough to make us or send us through amen take us through come on somebody can I ask you a question because if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change right is that right the children of Israel when the New Testament Church came into being they had nothing but the Old Testament that they could glean from they didn't have no Scrolls they had they had they had scribes you know Luke and different ones writing and stuff but listen understand they didn't have a printing press and and now now if God required them to say every word that Jesus said how are they going to remember it they didn't have no Scrolls but Jesus Promised according to Ezekiel he said I write it upon the tables of your heart that's what that's what Mo that's what Paul came right in Hebrews says listen I'll write it upon the tables of your that's where it is am you'll know what I said because I'm putting it down in there my point is this is by Revelation anyhow you don't even know what he's saying until it's revealed to you the Bible said you don't even know that Jesus Christ is the Lord amen without it being revealed to you Christ in you you don't know that you can have this thing up in your head and you still don't know God how do you know you don't know God when you don't trust him that's good amen because once you know him you trust him to your death amen so my point is anybody here smart enough in here to remember what is 1600 Tes I guarantee you not one person here could name them one by one I guarantee you and me most of us couldn't even tell what's on them verbatim anybody now now wait a minute wait a minute but you got to say exactly what he said how do you know y'all understand what I'm point and I'm not making mockery I'm trying to tell you when the Holy Ghost comes in you when the Seal of God is coming you you have the word amen amen yes sir it's no longer you living it's Christ Living in you amen and you'll know that you know that you know you may not have ever read let me tell you so many things I preach then down the road I hear a message brother Brandon preached and is exactly what he said how would I have known no I don't know but Jesus knows what he said and if I got Jesus on the inside he knows what he said I'm not telling you not to studying to read but if you got the Seal of the Holy Ghost in you that Holy Ghost vindicate things that you you you'll know stuff and don't know how you know it because the word is written in the table of your heart you don't never say listen like Le you say we well we don't have need of nothing now you know you know and I know we are in the in a place where you come the counseling is to be tried in the fire you can't get out of it you come to be tested come on y'all losing the anointing now y'all losing me I'm not leaving you or something or what but listen I can feel it so I'm going to close but let me tell you something by the grace of God your outcry you you got to know what you're crying for because Israel cried I want to be delivered Moses came they didn't want him so it made them stay in Egypt 40 years more four 40 more years they stayed under the whip of pharaoh because when God sent them to deliverer they didn't want him they saw him as a murderer look what has happened why are we still here brother brandham said it like this he said he he God if the generation this generation don't believe it God will weighs up another generation he said he will get that generation that's going to believe the word of God and produce a Rapture amen if this generation died not believing he'll get another generation he'll get another generation he'll get another generation but the word of God will not come back void amuah you love the Lord am let's stand he said Jerusalem cried Lord we we know the Messiah we want a messiah then when Jesus came he said God confounded them he didn't send him on a horse he made him a babe in a Manger amen hallelujah he confounded the wise people he made him a baby in a Manger and is what they needed Hallelujah it still was the grace of God come along at the age of 12 he he was so smart and and learned amen by his father he confounded the doctors of divinity where did he get his teaching from Oh Glory to God I'm feeling pretty good amen now people of God let me say it like this I can't give you the Holy Ghost but if I could I would when the word of God s go Have I None such as have give I Thee they perceived they had Faith though yes amen see it don't make no difference how a person come up in the line for prayer if you want oh I want the Holy Ghost your faith got to be there and all of us are going through something now let me say it like this don't blame yourself if you're going through something it's only because God is trying to perfect ffect you amen we must learn to say Thank You Lord in everything say thanks all things all things all things Lord they F to take my head off thank you Lord amen huh they going to throw me into the lions Lord thank you Lord when they whip Peter James and John says Lord thank you for counting me worthy to for f oh my my my thank you for allowing me to suffer for your name's sake yeah ah I'm not I'm not afraid of this hour that's coming upon us hallelujah if he would count me worthy I want to escape it though Hallelujah trust he count me worthy amen but let me tell you something before that Raptor take place you will be feeling pressure don't let nobody think because I'm going to tell you like this what's happening in the spirit you're now feeling the spiritual pressure before a murder takes place it happens spiritually first anything right it happen spiritually first didn't manifest itself in the natural so what you're now feeling is demonic pressures am fighting you in your mind right trying to do what produce fear come on even this message I preach here tonight Satan is trying to produce fear in your heart trying to make you some of us believe you're not going to make it that's nonsense that's a that's a spirit of the devil God is preaching this word to tell you that you areen oh oh God I can't do it that's why he's saying he will amen that's why the Covenant is is unconditional it ain't about you it's about him amen people of God don't let the devil make you think negative when the word come amen if somebody said oh my there's an eagle and a crow you better say I'm not an eagle amen confession confession when you confess something you've said something that someone else has said in other words you make when you confess your faith you're just saying what Jesus said about you I'm holy I'm Sanctified I'm bride I'm chosen I'm elected That's My Confession amen he said it I'm saying it amen and he said he brings that confession to pass right by the words of your mouth you're creating the atmosphere am but anyway you got to you got to realize by the grace of God when you crying out before the Lord you crying out to to have it done and so Israel cried out but you see what happened in their hearts they weren't ready they wanted Deliverance but their Deliverance that they wanted was only to be more sinful it proved it because when they got in the wilderness all they did was to be more sinful well it was already in the heart before they left Egypt it was still in the heart showing that the blood doesn't cleans your cleanse your heart when it's in justification huh they went in the wilderness to be Sanctified but they wouldn't let God sanctify them he put the test in your life to get out all the unbelief that's what he said I read that in Deuteronomy to get all the unbelief out of your heart he brings you the test is God God is God God yes sir he's a Healer he's a deliverer I don't care how long it take he still said he's a Healer amen if he can't heal me how can he Rapture me amen how can I get up from the dead if he can't restore me because if you get up from the dead that that's a complete restoration that's one of the great that you can't be no more perfect yall understand me so my point is this let them come let your Trials come but why I guarantee you if you really start worshiping God in your trials now you'll see Deliverance he will smile on you but God wants you to confuse the devil with your with your confession huh he wants you to praise him thank him glorify him amen I I was running on my treadmill and somebody had done broke it and I jammed that finger did the treadmill stop yes but it it it y'all I tell you what these little fingers they can

repentance hen it shows something's wrong something's going on when we can all stand and think we're all all right and the Holy Ghost through the word of God has already showed you that you're not
