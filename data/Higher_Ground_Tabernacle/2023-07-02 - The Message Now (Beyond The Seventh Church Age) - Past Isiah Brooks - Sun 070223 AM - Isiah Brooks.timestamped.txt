[49:14] the word of God
[49:18] I was told that you enjoyed the word
[49:21] last week
[49:24] my son who was in California uh
[49:31] he was able to listen online
[49:38] but before I go any further yeah
[49:56] she she's
[49:57] amazing I mean um and I know that God
[50:01] gave me my wife
[50:04] we've been married 47 years
[50:08] so still kicking hello
[50:11] and so I thank God foreign
[50:19] [Music]
[50:22] now as we stand let us turn to the
[50:25] scripture
[50:27] we're going to go to Genesis first
[50:34] and from there we'll run to Revelations
[50:39] Genesis
[50:42] 21 through 22.7
[50:50] laughs Genesis 3 21-22.
[50:58] also into his wife did the Lord make
[51:01] coats of skins
[51:03] and cloth clothed them
[51:06] and the Lord God said behold the man has
[51:10] become as one of us
[51:12] to no good and evil
[51:14] and now lest he put forth his hand and
[51:18] take also of the tree of life and eat
[51:21] and live forever
[51:26] it is
[51:38] [Music]
[51:41] foreign
[52:13] for God so loved the world
[52:16] that he gave his only begotten son
[52:19] that whosoever believeth in him should
[52:23] not perish but have everlasting life
[52:28] is
[52:34] not his son into the world to condemn
[52:37] the world
[52:38] but that the world through him might be
[52:41] saved
[52:43] upon voice
[52:49] he that believeth on him is not
[52:51] condemned but he that believeth not
[52:54] already because he have not believed in
[52:58] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[53:09] and this is the condemnation the light
[53:13] is coming to the world and Men love
[53:15] Darkness rather than light because their
[53:18] deeds were evil is
[53:28] for everyone
[53:29] that doeth evil hateth the light
[53:34] neither cometh to the light lest his
[53:37] deed should be his deeds should be
[53:40] reproved
[53:43] is
[53:49] Revelations 5 apocalypse
[53:55] will begin reading at the fourth verse
[54:07] and I wept much
[54:09] because no man was found worthy to open
[54:12] and to read the book neither to look
[54:14] thereon is
[54:18] [Music]
[54:21] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[54:24] not Behold The Lion of Judah excuse me
[54:28] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[54:31] the root of David have prevailed to open
[54:34] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[54:36] thereof is
[54:38] [Music]
[54:46] low in the midst of the throne and of
[54:51] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[54:53] eldest stood a lamb as it had been slain
[54:56] having seven horns seven eyes which are
[55:00] the seven spirits of God sent forth into
[55:03] the Earth
[55:04] [Music]
[55:18] and he came and took the book out of the
[55:21] right hand of him that sat upon the
[55:25] throne
[56:29] Foundation
[57:06] amen amen you may be seated
[57:13] I'll try to take my time by the grace of
[57:15] God
[57:21] just talking with others the other day
[57:24] Psalm the other day
[57:27] kind of made me think on on thoughts
[57:30] that I'm going to bring forth this
[57:32] morning
[57:36] this is a serious time
[57:41] um and I fear that so many people
[57:45] they're not seeing the time that we're
[57:48] living in Nevada
[57:53] um I've been studying and reading
[57:56] Jeremiah
[57:59] and uh Jeremiah Was A a mighty man of
[58:03] God
[58:05] sit down prophet and in that book it
[58:09] also leave them in reading it on on the
[58:12] design all I could see is today
[58:16] all of the events to Elizabeth basically
[58:20] that
[58:21] took place in Jeremiah's writing
[58:25] those things unfolding
[58:31] uh as God spoke to Israel
[58:34] Israel he's now speaking to
[58:37] the spirituals Israel
[58:40] Israel spiritual I heard brother Branham
[58:44] City any in paraphrasing he said
[58:48] Christ was in Jeremiah
[58:51] Christ was in Moses
[58:53] Christ was in all of the prophets of old
[58:56] Christ
[58:59] and I thought to myself then how can a
[59:03] preacher
[59:04] do not preach on sin
[59:07] if Jeremiah's anointing see uh
[59:15] that that was in Jeremiah
[59:19] it's also in Christ
[59:21] y'all hear what I'm saying and think
[59:25] about it God sent us
[59:27] on foreign
[59:41] uh he he and I'm not I'm just saying
[59:45] because we must understand
[59:48] that if you don't see this message
[59:55] that's what I'm talking about you're
[59:58] seeing that God sent a prophets
[1:00:02] what he preached
[1:00:05] you will miss it
[1:00:08] hallelujah amen now the prophet of God
[1:00:11] he told us
[1:00:14] scientifically oh scientific moment
[1:00:16] there's one out of a million
[1:00:21] that makes it to the birth
[1:00:24] I'm making this a Doctrine
[1:00:28] but he's yet and still man he he repeats
[1:00:33] that
[1:00:34] times through different messages
[1:00:39] now I want to say it like this
[1:00:43] my message to today
[1:00:46] is the message
[1:00:50] we know that we are beyond the seventh
[1:00:53] Church age
[1:00:55] we are in what we call the bride
[1:01:00] but but saying we're in the body
[1:01:05] Hallelujah
[1:01:09] you see
[1:01:11] we we we must understand
[1:01:13] that the book is open to there and we
[1:01:18] must understand that revelation
[1:01:21] of Revelations
[1:01:24] it's a book of symbols
[1:01:27] you can't just literally take it for
[1:01:29] what it says
[1:01:34] it has to reveal to you
[1:01:36] let those symbols
[1:01:39] song and what they mean
[1:01:44] I heard the prophet say that
[1:01:47] basically we're in the last episode
[1:01:54] the last episode of the book The episode
[1:01:58] and he goes on to say it like this
[1:02:02] when when justification Luther's age was
[1:02:06] over
[1:02:07] there
[1:02:11] and when Ed Wesley's Aid was over he had
[1:02:16] to die
[1:02:17] and the Pentecostal lady
[1:02:28] is why the book had to be opened
[1:02:34] it had to be revealed
[1:02:41] I was not doing a new thing
[1:02:44] okay
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:03:07] Hallelujah
[1:03:10] you say you mean to tell me
[1:03:15] people can follow the message
[1:03:19] and not have the revelation of what it
[1:03:21] is
[1:03:23] absolutely absolutely more Millions
[1:03:26] followed
[1:03:28] Moses
[1:03:30] millions of people followed Moses
[1:03:36] Millions let's bring it to our modern
[1:03:38] terms I'm not going to millions of
[1:03:40] Christians
[1:03:43] and only two out of that generation
[1:03:48] millions of Christians
[1:04:01] you understand
[1:04:03] what they were being led into
[1:04:07] Hallelujah didn't bring us just a
[1:04:10] Pentecostal message
[1:04:17] that will bring us into a Perfection
[1:04:25] an experience
[1:04:28] foreign
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:05:31] remember the book was shut it was closed
[1:05:38] but we find out foreign
[1:06:09] there was a door that was shot
[1:06:12] now the door is open
[1:06:14] so you got to find out who is the door
[1:06:18] and who is the book
[1:06:20] right because the door open door wasn't
[1:06:26] just opened
[1:06:28] to peer into it
[1:06:38] see it's not enough to say I can quote
[1:06:41] brother Brown
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:59] hallelujah amen and you can't get it
[1:07:02] there by education
[1:07:09] Hallelujah to most people that talk just
[1:07:12] just sick of it
[1:07:15] Hallelujah is that right right yeah we
[1:07:19] had we had a intellectual Revival
[1:07:24] all of us we probably know some of the
[1:07:27] most deepest things
[1:07:31] didn't even know it was in the Bible
[1:07:38] it will never
[1:08:06] how many Christians don't even believe
[1:08:09] that God is God
[1:08:12] uh to the least little things
[1:08:15] little things
[1:08:24] Hallelujah when the Bible says if you
[1:08:28] abide in me
[1:08:37] foreign
[1:08:47] like let me move on this is what I won't
[1:08:50] say so God
[1:08:52] opened this message
[1:08:55] and the message brother Bantam tells us
[1:08:58] can be found throughout the Bible
[1:09:01] shadows and in types to form the deep in
[1:09:05] the zombie you've heard me preach on
[1:09:07] Esther
[1:09:08] and when Esther
[1:09:11] walked into the the king's uh throne
[1:09:14] room
[1:09:16] you heard me talk about how there was a
[1:09:19] moment of silence
[1:09:22] because you know he was the
[1:09:36] but that's not true
[1:09:39] silence it's when you don't want no uh
[1:09:43] someone else
[1:09:49] it's like when somebody talks to you
[1:09:53] yeah
[1:09:55] well you're listening and whatever they
[1:09:59] tell you to do
[1:10:00] it but that silence that's where you
[1:10:05] don't want anybody to know what you're
[1:10:06] doing
[1:10:10] disgrace
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:11:04] amen hallelujah remember
[1:11:08] during this time of Elijah
[1:11:12] might woman yeah judgment had already
[1:11:16] struck Israel and around surrounding
[1:11:18] area
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:28] then came Elijah
[1:11:31] and what happens when this woman sees
[1:11:34] Elijah
[1:11:35] he offers him water
[1:11:38] is that right that's right see when you
[1:11:40] get the message you gotta you gotta
[1:11:42] bring something
[1:11:46] take from it
[1:11:57] and Elijah said woman
[1:12:01] go go go fetch me some cakes
[1:12:06] but understand
[1:12:10] s God is working on both ends
[1:12:20] who else is around her husband is dead
[1:12:39] fix me buy cakes first
[1:12:43] you starving
[1:12:45] I said me and my son we're going to eat
[1:12:48] the last of this is
[1:12:53] sometimes y'all know they're so free as
[1:12:55] that
[1:12:58] you could have a bag of cookies and
[1:13:00] somebody asked for some and you act like
[1:13:01] what's wrong with you on the bus quick
[1:13:04] example
[1:13:06] um
[1:13:23] I think about it I want everybody to
[1:13:26] think about it
[1:13:27] in the condition that you're in now
[1:13:30] spiritually conditions
[1:13:34] would you be a blessing to Heaven
[1:13:41] there's no unclean thing is going to be
[1:13:44] there
[1:14:14] oh yeah
[1:14:16] oh let me move on I know this is why I
[1:14:19] want to see people say well I I let me
[1:14:21] move on this one I gotta preach it the
[1:14:23] way you said it
[1:14:24] um so we understand that we understand
[1:14:27] the oil we understand the meal offering
[1:14:31] yeah and the connections
[1:14:39] until she could perceived he was a true
[1:14:44] man of God
[1:14:49] a man
[1:14:51] you know it's amazing I'll see Matthew
[1:14:54] I could go preach this in a denomination
[1:14:57] of church
[1:15:02] but the message has become so common
[1:15:04] which shows it's a danger zone
[1:15:17] because when I was on my uh when I was
[1:15:21] on my uh
[1:15:22] little journey there
[1:15:26] we we got before the Lord
[1:15:29] and I learned a lot of things about
[1:15:32] myself
[1:15:35] and and I learned what a what a True
[1:15:38] Believer
[1:15:42] a True Believer believes every word
[1:15:46] no matter what he or she goes through
[1:15:51] every word
[1:15:54] and they love the counseling of God
[1:16:00] Judgment of God is
[1:16:03] that right for example no matter what
[1:16:06] befalls you boys
[1:16:13] Paul said in whatever state I found
[1:16:16] myself in depends
[1:16:21] he's not the only one even
[1:17:07] there's no evidence
[1:17:11] what made Brothers
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:28] you gotta be proven
[1:17:33] Hallelujah
[1:17:35] let me read something out of the
[1:17:37] question and answers on the seals
[1:17:42] paragraph 114.
[1:17:46] brother Brandon says
[1:17:48] nothing will be saved no person um
[1:17:52] whose names were put on the Lamb's Book
[1:17:54] of Life
[1:17:57] for the foundation in the world
[1:18:01] see that's all the book that that
[1:18:05] mystery excuse me the book holds that
[1:18:08] mystery
[1:18:11] and the book is unfolding it now
[1:18:15] it's unfolding it now
[1:18:19] not each one's name
[1:18:22] but what the mystery of the book is
[1:18:27] calling those names
[1:18:30] did you finally understand that now
[1:18:33] if God doesn't say Isaiah
[1:18:46] foreign
[1:18:54] Hallelujah
[1:18:58] if you come to any of it and say oh you
[1:19:00] know I don't agree with that
[1:19:04] with your birth
[1:19:10] listen another quote coming from the
[1:19:13] position of a believer in Christ
[1:19:19] but by grace are you saved
[1:19:23] through faith not by the works
[1:19:30] I'm a presbyterian I'm a Baptist I'm a
[1:19:35] Pentecostal no man can break
[1:19:39] message
[1:19:48] and there's reason he knows him yeah
[1:20:06] and those who he has Justified
[1:20:11] amen there you are voila
[1:20:14] hallelujah amen
[1:20:16] Hallelujah the mystery let me stare of
[1:20:20] this whole book
[1:20:22] was hidden in the land
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:28] Hallelujah you see that's the reason I
[1:20:30] read the scripture
[1:20:33] in in Genesis
[1:20:35] when when God uh
[1:20:39] found an animal
[1:20:41] and we read that
[1:20:44] uh and and and but God never said it was
[1:20:47] a lamb
[1:20:48] how did we come to know it was a Lambs
[1:20:54] it was a lamb
[1:20:56] then we were able to find it in the
[1:20:58] scripture
[1:21:00] in the Book of Revelations where it says
[1:21:19] this is this is the ultimate
[1:21:23] my Revelation
[1:21:28] that God so loved me
[1:21:34] I'm gonna say it again that God so loved
[1:21:38] you
[1:21:41] I'm gonna say it again God so loved you
[1:21:45] may
[1:21:48] and this love I'm talking about is
[1:21:53] this is why I can't see why people don't
[1:21:56] get excited
[1:22:02] you know how you faulty you faulted
[1:22:06] let me see the person who's in your
[1:22:09] determine
[1:22:30] Hallelujah now think about this and I
[1:22:34] couldn't help but in my time of quiet
[1:22:36] and silence I couldn't help but to think
[1:22:39] on uh how he loved me
[1:22:44] and you know I I said like this it was
[1:22:48] so wonderful till I saw something that I
[1:22:50] don't even realize I don't even know
[1:22:51] what it was I saw
[1:22:53] it yeah
[1:22:57] before I was born
[1:22:59] he loved me you might be a man
[1:23:04] before you were born he loved you
[1:23:09] I'm talking about eternal love now
[1:23:12] God didn't say oh my goodness
[1:23:22] as a man he died
[1:23:33] even when I was a child my mom and dad
[1:23:37] wasn't around
[1:23:44] but that was his Divine love let's see
[1:23:47] this when I moved
[1:23:50] that was his Divine love
[1:23:56] y'all hear what I'm saying some of us
[1:23:59] know
[1:24:04] it's dying love his Undying Love
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:50] Hallelujah
[1:24:52] and when he placed
[1:24:54] your name in the book
[1:24:57] never never understood
[1:24:59] why he couldn't get rid of you
[1:25:01] Hallelujah
[1:25:04] but right now the devil knows the truth
[1:25:07] you have responded
[1:25:10] to the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:19] this message is right
[1:25:22] that this is you
[1:25:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:31] Hallelujah Roger glory to God so
[1:25:34] revelation 5.
[1:25:51] you don't do this
[1:25:56] right amen but what we fail to see
[1:26:02] in God's Minds
[1:26:04] those laws never applied
[1:26:11] because you got to realize who God
[1:26:13] justifies
[1:26:15] you understand me even in Isaiah says
[1:26:23] yeah you say oh what do you mean
[1:26:27] God's love
[1:26:32] let's see if so you understand
[1:26:35] that woman will be caught in adultery
[1:26:40] according to the law she should have
[1:26:42] been stung Hallelujah
[1:26:46] but Jesus being God
[1:26:51] where are your accusers Hallelujah
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:13] because you'll stand there
[1:27:17] virtuously clean virtues
[1:27:20] as though you've never seen in the first
[1:27:23] place
[1:27:50] that's what you've been designed to be
[1:27:52] disease
[1:27:58] Hallelujah
[1:28:00] Revelation 5 4 through 7.
[1:28:05] he said I wealth much
[1:28:07] because no man was found worthy
[1:28:13] neither to look their own
[1:28:17] and one of the elves are said unto me
[1:28:21] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:28:25] the root of David have prevailed to open
[1:28:30] the book
[1:28:31] if you lose the Seven Seals thereof this
[1:28:34] is said soon
[1:28:58] and the Bible has episodes
[1:29:09] you've heard me say this before when
[1:29:13] when Eliza
[1:29:15] go get Rebecca
[1:29:18] who told her to water the camels
[1:29:26] in a time of Silence
[1:29:29] when nobody knew
[1:29:31] nobody else heard it
[1:29:34] Rebecca Rebecca heard when that voice
[1:29:38] says
[1:29:39] ordered the camels too
[1:29:43] see that's how it is with the mystery of
[1:29:46] this message
[1:30:36] oh that's how it is Sheriff
[1:31:16] Hallelujah man
[1:31:20] you say tell me another one I'll tell
[1:31:22] you this morning
[1:31:23] how God is working right Among Us and a
[1:31:26] lot of us
[1:31:50] right no it's a time of urgency
[1:31:57] good to see you Sister Mary I didn't
[1:31:59] even know you were back there
[1:32:03] that's your mom isn't it okay
[1:32:07] praise the Lord Roger so anyway you know
[1:32:11] what you know it's so amazing see the
[1:32:15] moment because when God visited Abraham
[1:32:19] he came as three minutes y'all don't
[1:32:21] heard this is
[1:32:22] and and Abraham understood that was God
[1:32:26] I guarantee you if it had been 12
[1:32:39] it's more to God than just coming here
[1:32:42] and sit in the church yeah
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:52] when God discerned because
[1:32:56] I also then told Abraham he says I'm
[1:33:00] going to visit you again
[1:33:03] now in the process in this time of
[1:33:08] Silence
[1:33:09] something was taking place
[1:33:12] we would have never known it
[1:33:15] brother Brandon said
[1:33:17] he's changed from old to Young
[1:33:22] not just all too young
[1:33:24] Sarah was changed
[1:33:32] and then when he did come again
[1:33:35] he didn't visit Abraham
[1:33:37] he visited Sarah
[1:33:40] she was the one who conceived
[1:33:44] in other words in the secret time
[1:33:50] his visitation
[1:33:52] Sarah
[1:33:57] so let me say it like this
[1:34:00] this is your time of conception
[1:34:05] this is your time of conception
[1:34:09] to receive the
[1:34:13] Christen the full word
[1:34:17] hallelujah you're okay with this so
[1:34:20] anyway let's move on let's move on to
[1:34:23] Saint John
[1:34:26] 29 to 34.
[1:34:29] this is the message today
[1:34:32] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:34:37] prepare
[1:35:07] he didn't say my daddy
[1:35:14] he included the whole family of God yeah
[1:35:19] supposed to include the whole family of
[1:35:22] God
[1:35:34] we're family
[1:35:39] more
[1:35:46] important than your natural family
[1:35:49] natural you got a real Revelation going
[1:35:52] on
[1:35:54] they say Jesus Brothers
[1:36:13] now I don't know how you feel but I feel
[1:36:15] like this is
[1:36:20] foreign
[1:36:53] Peter James and John yeah
[1:36:58] they began to Rejoice
[1:37:01] hey y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:37:05] um
[1:37:22] you don't have to understand it
[1:37:24] just know that God is in the mood
[1:37:30] save me Saint John please
[1:37:32] 129.
[1:37:34] yeah we've heard the scripture
[1:37:38] Hallelujah but for those we have some
[1:37:40] newcomers and so I want to bring this
[1:37:43] out for them
[1:37:45] the next day John seeth Jesus coming
[1:37:48] unto him
[1:37:49] and say and and saith Behold the Lamb of
[1:37:54] God which taketh away the sin of the
[1:37:57] world
[1:38:03] I know this might sound Elementary to
[1:38:06] you
[1:38:07] but this was the first time
[1:38:10] I'm really quick in that word
[1:38:25] so Jesus come to save us
[1:38:30] this is why the theme of The Prophet was
[1:38:33] this is
[1:38:44] um
[1:38:46] this is he of whom
[1:38:48] I said
[1:38:50] after me cometh the man which is
[1:38:53] prepared before me
[1:38:56] for he was before me since
[1:39:03] and so anytime you hear that word behold
[1:39:17] in other words there's something that
[1:39:19] you should see
[1:39:21] and here in the 31st verses and I knew
[1:39:24] him not
[1:39:27] but that he
[1:39:31] he should come baptizing with water
[1:39:36] is
[1:39:41] saying I saw the Spirit descending from
[1:39:45] heaven like a dove and it Abode upon him
[1:39:55] I I just you know I think to myself
[1:39:59] you know when I see that pill of fire
[1:40:01] about but brother brother
[1:40:05] what do message people think we
[1:40:10] ought to be ashamed of ourselves
[1:40:11] God left that own record for you
[1:40:15] I wasn't there when it happened
[1:40:19] so God took a picture
[1:40:22] so that you can see and understand
[1:40:30] Hallelujah
[1:40:46] but this time
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:51] upon his head
[1:40:53] y'all hear what I'm saying that was just
[1:40:57] to show headshots
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:13] that God has visited us
[1:41:20] and he's left us a message
[1:41:25] and this thing is pleaded
[1:41:29] Pentecostal
[1:41:35] s
[1:41:37] supposed to be the shortest of all
[1:41:41] how much time we have left
[1:41:43] y'all better hear what I'm saying but we
[1:41:47] are right in the seconds
[1:41:54] but you must have like the like that old
[1:41:57] I said like brother bear said like that
[1:41:59] old colored man said the confines
[1:42:01] travel at the river
[1:42:07] Hallelujah
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:10] I don't know
[1:42:13] John said I'd be a record
[1:42:17] he said I didn't know him to God
[1:42:20] descending this song it's amazing it's
[1:42:23] amazing because even when the pillar of
[1:42:26] fire showed up
[1:42:27] above the head of the Prophet remember
[1:42:33] but God left his own message
[1:42:39] that this message is not a man's message
[1:42:43] this message is
[1:42:47] let me hear what I'm saying
[1:42:49] and if that be true
[1:42:52] he is the last prophet is
[1:43:01] part of the mystery
[1:43:05] they said so Hallelujah
[1:43:08] God
[1:43:09] yeah
[1:43:12] Hallelujah Revelations
[1:43:36] it was completely blacked out
[1:43:43] to put a little light up there
[1:43:48] all of that life Hallelujah
[1:43:55] that's where the messages bringing to us
[1:43:59] you know we're not supposed to be this
[1:44:01] way I think systems
[1:44:20] something
[1:44:34] it's still not enough
[1:44:42] he can't satisfy your flesh
[1:44:48] and it's still not enough
[1:44:52] I remember when I was a kid
[1:44:55] my mom would give me a little piece of
[1:44:57] candy
[1:44:58] act like I didn't appreciate it
[1:45:04] out of my hands
[1:45:07] you don't appreciate what I gave you an
[1:45:10] opportunity none at all that's what she
[1:45:14] did thank God that God is not like that
[1:45:20] Hallelujah you can't come to him with
[1:45:22] some kind of attitude
[1:45:25] humbly before God
[1:45:31] the reason why it was
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:37] amen
[1:45:41] Hallelujah
[1:45:44] Revelation 4 1-2
[1:45:48] cause this is one service
[1:45:51] and I I trust you if your food is on a
[1:45:55] timer
[1:46:00] Revelations 4 1 through 2.
[1:46:04] after this I looked
[1:46:06] and behold a door was open now
[1:46:14] who is the door Kila Potter
[1:46:17] there's only one door concert
[1:46:21] even even in the Psalms where it says
[1:46:24] lift up your head
[1:46:33] they first had to find out who was the
[1:46:36] king of Glory Hallelujah
[1:46:44] foreign
[1:47:31] had such a mind I don't have it anymore
[1:47:34] he actually had the mind of God
[1:47:37] and I'm gonna cut it short in just a
[1:47:39] minute because
[1:47:41] but the Bible tells us that when God
[1:47:45] told Adam
[1:47:46] name those animals the new memes the
[1:47:49] animals had already been named by God
[1:47:59] the mind of God
[1:48:02] every animal I don't I know according to
[1:48:06] this mind of God
[1:48:10] every one of them
[1:48:13] right sorry it was God who was the head
[1:48:16] of Adam
[1:48:18] so Adam didn't say well I just want to
[1:48:21] do this he had to be like Jesus
[1:48:39] he listened to the voice of his wife
[1:48:55] that's the same thing the second Adam
[1:48:57] had to do
[1:48:59] nothing
[1:49:01] he says and listen
[1:49:05] I looked and behold the door was open in
[1:49:08] Heavens
[1:49:10] and the first voice which which I heard
[1:49:13] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[1:49:16] me
[1:49:16] which said come up hither
[1:49:19] I will show these things which must be
[1:49:22] Hereafter
[1:49:27] works
[1:49:34] so you understand
[1:49:38] John didn't just go up there near the
[1:49:41] moon
[1:49:43] um
[1:49:44] John was transported
[1:49:48] into another dimensions
[1:49:57] we thought heaven was millions of miles
[1:49:59] away
[1:50:01] right here
[1:50:09] and this is the important part he says
[1:50:12] and immediately I was in the spirit
[1:50:20] is the spirit
[1:50:22] and behold the throne was set in heaven
[1:50:27] and one sat on the throne
[1:50:34] amen
[1:50:35] amen the doors Jesus Christ himself
[1:50:39] and he's telling you look inside me
[1:50:43] look inside this book
[1:50:46] we didn't know what it was um
[1:50:50] it was sealed but brother but but the uh
[1:50:54] Jesus Christ broke the seal the Lambs
[1:50:58] and then brother Brown began to preach
[1:51:01] what was hidden
[1:51:03] y'all hear what I'm saying what was he
[1:51:06] doing he whipped he went into the mind
[1:51:09] of God
[1:51:11] how did that information
[1:51:15] huge messages like Christ The Mystery of
[1:51:18] God
[1:51:21] revealed in his own words
[1:51:25] came from
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:54] but one of the most significant things
[1:52:06] I'm almost done he said listen
[1:52:11] in other words I'm going to show you the
[1:52:13] next episode
[1:52:18] what was the next episode
[1:52:21] the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:52:25] it was no more open show he said the
[1:52:28] blue on spectacular the preaching of the
[1:52:31] Gospel
[1:52:37] to the to the uh Pharisees
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:46] he had filled his disciples
[1:52:51] after the resurrection
[1:52:55] Jesus appeared to his disciples
[1:53:01] he opens the book
[1:53:05] and he began to preach to them
[1:53:07] Christ
[1:53:09] from the from all of the prophets and
[1:53:12] sages all the way up
[1:53:14] time
[1:53:18] it is
[1:53:23] again on the third day
[1:53:26] in the scriptures
[1:53:33] and by this he told them there's a
[1:53:38] greater move coming yeah um
[1:53:58] and you know a lot of people
[1:54:01] I'm almost done I'm not going to be able
[1:54:04] to finish this I finish on the
[1:54:05] other time but I'm trying to bring
[1:54:07] something
[1:54:09] because I want you to see
[1:54:12] what's so important about the lamb and
[1:54:14] I'm a closer
[1:54:18] God revealed to us in Genesis
[1:54:23] if it was Genesis in the lamb
[1:54:26] in Genesis
[1:54:29] the lamb in the Revelation
[1:54:32] here in Genesis
[1:54:39] in the Book of Revelation
[1:54:42] the lamb sets on the throne
[1:54:45] Hallelujah the same lamb that had become
[1:54:49] sacrificial
[1:54:53] King of Kings
[1:54:57] he's become the almighty God
[1:55:00] hallelujah so let me bring it to you by
[1:55:04] God
[1:55:05] see and I don't know to me it it is
[1:55:11] it this could be preached every day
[1:55:14] but until you understand what's being
[1:55:17] said
[1:55:21] let me tell you something with you we're
[1:55:24] fooling ourselves
[1:55:26] we
[1:55:31] cannot love one another
[1:55:37] Lotto
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:56:02] oh
[1:56:04] love is sacrificial
[1:56:06] sacrifice this is why it was called the
[1:56:09] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:56:16] forfeit all your rights Hallelujah
[1:56:21] is that all right
[1:56:23] you love the Lord
[1:56:25] ah let me let me let me move on
[1:56:30] brother Brown I'm in the message and
[1:56:31] then came Jesus
[1:56:35] he said oh you say is
[1:56:38] I spoke in tongues
[1:56:41] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:56:44] I've shouted
[1:56:47] I have nothing to do with it
[1:56:50] Paul said I could speak in tongues like
[1:56:55] men and angels
[1:56:59] I could have faith to move mountains
[1:57:08] the Divine love of God
[1:57:11] is it in your heart
[1:57:14] to take everything of the world out
[1:57:19] you're lost
[1:57:21] that's right so why and the devil's only
[1:57:25] deceiving you
[1:57:30] hmm
[1:57:32] you say well brother Brooks
[1:57:35] why are you preaching like that because
[1:57:38] I believe that the time is so short
[1:57:42] and there's so many of us
[1:57:45] still playing Church
[1:57:50] well you will not go before God
[1:57:55] and accuse me of not preaching it
[1:57:59] because I'm going to tell you the truth
[1:58:03] and you can let uh listen you could
[1:58:07] think
[1:58:08] when a man dies
[1:58:10] to himself I can hold your hands
[1:58:16] and I could say please
[1:58:22] your time it's your time
[1:58:24] you understand me
[1:58:27] amen there is nobody's system in hell
[1:58:30] that's what the world got people believe
[1:58:32] in oh it's good
[1:58:37] whatever no no let me ask you a question
[1:58:42] if hell does consist of fire
[1:58:48] in your neighbor on fire
[1:58:56] you're not going to run up to your name
[1:58:58] like
[1:59:01] no no no no no the agony now fire is
[1:59:05] nothing
[1:59:07] compared to being lost
[1:59:11] that's another that's another feeling
[1:59:15] I've seen little kids in the mall
[1:59:19] they get misplaced
[1:59:22] their mom and dad
[1:59:26] see the distress on their faces
[1:59:33] and then all of the tears began to fall
[1:59:37] they begin to get hysterical
[1:59:40] feeling that feeling of love
[1:59:45] and nobody can Comfort them
[1:59:48] but mama and daddy
[1:59:52] brother Brandon said it the foreign
[1:59:57] he wasn't dead
[2:00:04] it was all about listen
[2:00:08] you're not going to be looking in hell
[2:00:10] yeah
[2:00:16] oh
[2:00:17] you know what people you don't
[2:00:19] understand
[2:00:20] Judgment of this last age just last
[2:00:23] World brother man it said he said it's
[2:00:26] worse than Pompeii foreign
[2:00:35] and you want to stay here
[2:00:40] nothing should be more valuable to you
[2:00:42] than your soul right now
[2:00:57] nothing should be more valuable
[2:01:02] like he told the Rich Young rulers sell
[2:01:04] all that you have and follow me
[2:01:10] but what I'm trying to bring us to in in
[2:01:12] closing excuses
[2:01:15] must match his nature
[2:01:20] yes
[2:01:21] it has to come to that he said well how
[2:01:24] can it happen
[2:01:26] all right
[2:01:28] the Bible said the kingdom of God
[2:01:30] suffered violence
[2:01:40] said our birth is a mess
[2:01:47] so what I'm talking about
[2:01:51] the suffering of this world
