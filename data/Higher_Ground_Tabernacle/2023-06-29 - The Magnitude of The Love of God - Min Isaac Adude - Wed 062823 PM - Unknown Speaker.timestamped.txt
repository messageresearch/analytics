[47:17] Lord
[47:18] amen let's open our Bibles in the Book
[47:20] of Job we'll read the uh chapter 33
[47:23] verse 27 to 30.
[47:35] Job chapter 33 verse 20.
[47:49] job it's right before Psalms generally
[47:52] if your staff owners description
[47:55] amen the Bible says he looked upon man
[48:00] and if any say I have sinned and pervert
[48:03] and perverted that which was right and
[48:07] he profited me not
[48:09] investment city is
[48:17] all from going into the pit just life
[48:21] shall seek the light
[48:23] in it
[48:28] low on these things worketh
[48:31] God oftentimes with man to bring back
[48:34] his soul from the peat to be enlightened
[48:37] with the light of the living
[48:43] is
[48:47] let's turn to Romans chapter 5.
[48:52] verse 8 we are say wheat it's a very
[48:56] familiar chapter and verse
[49:04] foreign
[49:06] Romans chapter
[49:09] 8 or uh
[49:19] let's start from verse 1.
[49:25] Romans chapter 5 verse 1 to verse 8.
[49:30] when the Bible says that therefore being
[49:32] justified by faith we have peace with
[49:34] God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[49:41] but whom also we have access by faith
[49:45] into his into this grace wherein we
[49:48] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[49:51] glory of God
[49:53] um
[50:01] and not only so but with glory in
[50:05] tribulations also knowing that
[50:07] tribulation worketh patients and
[50:09] patience experience and experience
[50:14] hopefully perseverance
[50:24] verse 5 and I hope maketh not a shame
[50:27] because of love because the love of God
[50:29] is shared abroad in our hearts by the
[50:32] Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[50:34] persons
[50:42] for when we were yet without Strength In
[50:46] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly
[50:55] for scarcely
[50:57] for a righteous man will won't die yet
[51:01] her adventure for a good man some would
[51:04] even Dare To Die
[51:06] Apen
[51:19] but God commendeth his love toward us
[51:22] well we were yet sinners Christ died for
[51:25] us
[51:31] amen let's continue verse
[51:34] more than being now justified by his
[51:37] blood which shall be saved from wrath

[54:22] there is here greater than Solomon yeah
[54:26] I can't remember I was listening to this
[54:28] today
[54:33] and it's the story of him and one of his
[54:36] friends they usually go hunt together
[54:43] and his friend he kills animals or deers
[54:47] just for fun
[54:52] amen he knew exactly that the brother
[54:54] Branham didn't like you know when he was
[54:56] doing that but he was doing that on
[54:58] purpose
[55:02] yeah man he was doing that on purpose
[55:05] because he knew that brother Brennan
[55:07] didn't like it if it is
[55:10] so every time that they will go together
[55:13] that man would just kill deers for fun
[55:15] would just joke with them and shoot at
[55:17] them and things anymore
[55:22] and brother Brennan would tell him we're
[55:24] asking about why do you do this and he
[55:26] will say well I'm pretty sure if you
[55:28] were in a pasture you will be doing the
[55:30] same thing
[55:36] yeah if you were in the pasture or a
[55:39] preacher
[55:41] you'll be doing the same thing
[55:44] killing animals and just living there
[55:47] so it happens there is this uh day that
[55:51] they went out and you know hunting and
[55:53] and also evangelo's instrument that was
[55:56] imitating the the sound of the little
[55:59] deer alone
[56:05] so when he was doing the the mom will
[56:09] come to look for you know thinking that
[56:11] it's his baby that uh that's in trouble
[56:14] so he will come she will come to try to
[56:17] help him out uh
[56:22] man
[56:28] amen so he will come and try to see if
[56:31] there is uh one of the little deer is in
[56:33] trouble or not yeah
[56:40] so it happened that when he did that and
[56:43] and the deer saw the gun and then turned
[56:47] back hey
[56:52] this is
[56:56] when she came as close as just she
[56:59] called and once you saw the gun and then
[57:01] she turned back
[57:05] and then you're starting doing the same
[57:07] notes again
[57:10] remember and brother Brennan said that
[57:13] normally that deer will go back and will
[57:15] never turn back if you think
[57:22] she will go back she will fly and she
[57:25] will go as far away as she can
[57:34] the love of a mother that she had amen
[57:37] every time that that man was making that
[57:39] noise she was coming back
[57:46] amen she was coming back to make sure
[57:49] that one of her kids are not is not in
[57:51] trouble
[58:00] even happened that brother Branham was
[58:02] praying for him because he was like Lord
[58:04] this is really mean and he started
[58:06] praying for him
[58:11] saw how the love of their mother amen
[58:14] seeing the gun but she was still coming
[58:16] to them
[59:19] the Bible says that can a woman forget
[59:22] her sucking child
[59:27] that you should not have compassion on
[59:30] the son of her
[59:37] wombly yet will I not forget thee Memoir
[59:44] behold I have gravity upon the palms of
[59:47] my hands
[59:50] their walls are continually before me
[59:55] can a woman forget her sucking child
[59:58] that's good
[1:00:00] can a woman forget her baby
[1:00:05] it doesn't matter how long she's been
[1:00:08] away from that kid two important
[1:00:12] amen she will always remember that there
[1:00:15] is a time I had a son or a daughter that
[1:00:17] I gave away
[1:00:22] and cause that love is there with a
[1:00:24] little Bond it will be there forever
[1:00:27] the Bible said that even if that happens

[1:01:15] amen that is the love of God
[1:01:18] Amen that is why God died
[1:01:22] new amen the prophet says that one amen
[1:01:25] sin the prophet
[1:01:27] when men sin the Garden of Eden
[1:01:30] he crossed the great chairs from
[1:01:33] separating himself from Eternal one is
[1:01:42] man at that time was eternal with God
[1:01:47] he had no sickness sorrow or death
[1:01:53] man was not made to die
[1:01:58] hell was not made for men
[1:02:01] hair was created for the devils
[1:02:06] and not for mankind
[1:02:09] because they were created on Earth to be
[1:02:13] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:02:17] but when men seen and stepped across the
[1:02:20] bondering line the boundary line between
[1:02:22] remind

[1:02:32] himself no way back he says
[1:02:39] he was totally lost
[1:02:42] he could not come back because he had
[1:02:45] sin

[1:44:03] and if any say I have sinned and and
[1:44:07] perverted that which was right
[1:44:14] he would deliver his soul from going
[1:44:17] into the pit
[1:44:21] and his life shall see the light
[1:44:25] though all these things worketh God
[1:44:28] often times with men
[1:44:33] to bring back his soul from the pit
[1:44:36] to be enlightened with the light
[1:44:46] with it because a man looks at himself
[1:44:51] and said Lord I have sinned
