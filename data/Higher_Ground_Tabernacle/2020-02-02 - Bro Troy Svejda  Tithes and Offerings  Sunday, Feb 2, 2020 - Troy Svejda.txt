Paul writing they said and these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo's for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another for who make us need to differ from another and what hast thou that thou does not receive now if thou did sieve it why does thou glory if thou has not received it and now you are full now you are rich you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God that you did reign that we might also reign with you for I think that God hath set forth us the Apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle under the world and to angels and to men we are fools for Christ's sake the year wise in Christ we are weak but you are strong you are honorable but we're despised amen now let's turn over to turn to Genesis chapter 12 what do you have that you did not first receive you know I think every single one of us if we have anything any revelation as many might say well I I wish brother soso could see it the way I see it or I wish so-and-so could see it the way I see it well if you see anything it's because God gave it to you amen revelations chattri Genesis chapter 12 verse 1 says now in the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make I name great and thou shalt be a blessing I'll bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed a man let's just bow our heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just pray Lord that as you called me to be a minister Lord you didn't call me to minister my word Lord but to your work so father we just ask that you would come and bring the anointing this morning father and that you would speak through me Lord and not that I would speak Lord but you would speak through your vessel Lord and that the people might hear from your word Lord and be blessed Lord for you of giving yourself as an inheritance to the people Lord and so as they speak as we speak your word this morning father may their hearts be opened and may you be received into their hearts Lord and the might the people might leave today knowing we have heard from God this morning we have been blessed and we thank you Lord we we we we like Abraham we've lifted up our hands unto you Lord and we knowing that you have called us Lord now let us receive the inheritance of the baptism of the holy ghost that token of our future body we pray Lord as we receive you Lord we receive all things and we thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray we dedicate this service into your hands Lord amen amen you can be seated it's good to see everyone you this morning you know I really believe in church services I just I believe in them I believe that God ordained them when Jesus gave us the promise he said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I will come right there in the midst of them yone every time there is a visitation there is a purpose for that visitation Amen when Jesus visits his people he always does it for a very specific purpose Amen he gave us a promise that right here in a day called today he would visit his people a man wherever two or three are gathering in him I named I will come and I will visit you amen if he is going to come and visit us he's going to do it for a very specific purpose he's going to do it for a very specific reason so I think that even no matter what you had in your mind and you came into this door many people come to the house of God for specific purposes some people come out of traditions sake some people come because they feel that if they don't come people might talk against them some people come because just something to do but there are people that come into this place to meet God amen they come into this place because they have an opinion that they know it's been revealed unto them that if they come into this place that they will meet God now there are many of those say well I could stay home and meet God in my prayer closet and that is true I could stay home when I could pray and I believe that I can meet God well that is true amen but God has ordained that iron shall sharpen iron and that only happens when it makes contact amen and not only do we have to learn how to interact between God and man but we also have to in turn how to interact one with another amen and even beyond that God has placed in the church a ministry amen and that ministry it says in the book of Ephesians that ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints amen so there's something to do that ministry that would cause the Saints to come a little bit closer to call God to come a little bit better to become more perfected in Christ amen now let's go back over here let's go back to the beginning of what we were started preaching about talking about Abraham when Abraham was called he was called to leave his father behind to leave his father's house behind amen now when when Abraham was growing up in the land of ur he had a certain expectation that everything that his father owned will be transferred to him through what we call an inheritance Amen that has been throughout history that whenever the parents died that the children receive an inheritance from their from their parents from their father and their mother as their father and their mother spent all the days of their lives and as God blesses them gives them an increase that when they're when they when they when their parents pass away that all that they increased all that they amassed upon the earth on their life's journey now that that wealth that those inheritances passed to the children through the act of an inheritance amen and it's a blessing to the children that is stored up by the parents amen a now Abraham when he was growing up in the household of Terah Amen he had a right and expectation that he would receive an inheritance of his father amen and now but when God came and visited him he God gave him instructions I want you to leave all that behind I want you to reject your father's inheritance I want you to leave the comfort of your father's house I want you to leave all those things behind and I want you to go to a land that I will show you I have reserved a land for my namesake for the name of Jehovah and I am going to give you that as soon inherit but in order for you to receive this inheritance you have to leave your father's inheritance behind amen so so Abraham he he took God at His Word Amen he heard the word of God through the visitation of God and he was written in law and the inheritance of Jehovah was revealed to him and so he took God at His Word and he left the house of Terah behind he left his inheritance behind he left all of his rights behind he left everything behind and he went to the land that God had showed him amen amen as you know as someone was talking to me once about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and the man was believed more along the lines of a Baptist and he said was talking about how when we who believe in the Pentecostal blessings preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says he said that you're saying that the blood of Christ is not enough and that you're you're saying that there's a second blessing that the blood of Christ didn't do it all and we have to go and go receive a second a second blessing and so and and when I was thinking about about what the man was saying to me and I was kind of praying in my heart Lord Lord how do I respond to this man you know because I loved it and I wanted to give him a right answer and so I was praying in my heart like Lord what do I say to this man you know and all sudden though I can't keep our mind Abraham and I thought in my heart well when was Abraham saved because really it came down to this man was asking well what is salvation he wanted to know what salvation was and I was like so I asked him I was like when was Abraham saved that's a great question because however Abraham was saved it's how I'm saved however Abraham saved that's the same way and you know first Abraham you know he had to be called God had to call him and and and when the call was made Abraham had to respond and Abraham he did respond and not only do you respond but he left his father's house behind and he first took everything amen now first there was the request there was the call but as he answered the call there began to be visitations visitations visitations and there was different types of visitations that Abraham received but let me tell you none of those that we can really call God he is Abraham was actually was called before the foundation of the world Amen how can you put a finger which visitation was it that saved Abraham how could you say that any of those visitations were salvation he was saved before the foundation of the world and God was what was revealing that to Abraham through each visitation that he showed unto him he meant and it is those visitations that cause Abraham to forsake all now let's just go over to Genesis chapter 14 just 14 will read the 17th verse and it says now I don't know if you remember the story here but as Abraham had gone into the promised land and his he went with his cousin there or his nephew a lot and lot had gone down into Sodom and then lot ended up being taken captive amen and now when lot was taken captive there is something that rose up inside of Abraham where he had pity upon his nephew amen there was something that rose up inside and that pity was Christ it wasn't we would say it wasn't just a human pity but but but Abraham had received Christ as a possession as an inheritance amen and that inheritance was rising up on the inside of Abraham to where he had to go out and chase after his brother amen he was revealing Christ on the inside of himself they meant now Genesis chapter 14 verse 17 it says and the King saw it and went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the Kings are with him in the valley Shiva which is in the Kings Dale and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth now just a few years before this Abraham had been called Abram of Terah Abram was the son of Terah but now we come down to the process of time and how Abram was being called of the son of the Most High God he has now been transformed Burton being just as natural inheritance was Abram of Terah but now he's Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth something has happened something has changed and when Abraham was called now where abraham had to make a choice to forsake all let me tell you every single one of us heard that when we first get called we have to make that choice every single one of us has to make that choice to forsake oh you're never going to go anywhere on your Christian life's journey until you first come to a point in your life to where you accept Christ you say Lord where would I go what can I do Lord I I've seen enough i I've heard enough preaching I've seen I've seen you do enough I've seen enough upon life's journey and I lay myself down upon the altar and Lord I have made my choice you are my choice amen every single one of us has to come to that point amen but Abraham once he called he began to be changed and beginning to receive a new inheritance amen and he began to be changed he can begin to be changed amen now let's turn over to as I just used to give me a little bit patience here as we set this up let's go down to mark chapter 10 and let's read a little bit from the New Testament mark chapter 10 verse 17 we're familiar with the rich young ruler here and it says I win he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said oh why call sow me good there is none good but but one that is God thou knowest the commandments do not commit murder do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and my mother and he answer nice and don't master all these things I've observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and then come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grief where he had great possessions one thing I love about the way Jesus ministered and the way Jesus still ministers is God is so able to reach into your heart and discern remember Jesus is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart amen now one thing like like at the Ministry of brother Branham as you watch their broth and the prayer lines that through that ministry he could reach down to the people's hearts and discern their hearts they meant now that thing now brother Branham is not here solace is on the scene but that was that was Christ through brother Branham amen now just because brother Branham was gone doesn't mean that that has left the earth that was here before brother Branham was here and now brother Anna's gone that's still here amen but that was a revealing of Christ again to the last days Church amen to show Christ again to this last age to bring the faith of the people back to what the Pentecostal fathers had in the amen what they had they had Christ amen now Jesus Christ was able to discern the heart of this man and this man had been trying to serve Christ he been trying to serve Jehovah he said I have followed all the laws I have done everything that the law is said to do but he said one thing that you lack you have not forsaken all he looked down to his hearts he said there's why would we be nice only lack one thing and to have that one thing that you lack identified to you all you have to do is follow this one thing and you will have eternal life you will have life that will never pass away amen you will enter into his gates with Thanksgiving you learnt into his courts with praise one of these days your feet will walk through those gates and you will enter in and you'll be the son or the daughter of God entering into his inheritance amen remember abraham lacked one thing he was in his father's house and he had to leave it all behind it was revealed unto him what he had to do amen and through that revelation he obeyed that revelation he entered into an inheritance he became the put the Abraham of the Most High God possessor of the heavens and the earth a man he used to be Abram of Terah and he had an expectation that you did inherit all that Terra had but now a few chapters down the road you find out how he is Abram of the Most High God possessor of the heavens and earth what an inheritance change he's grown up in the gospel Amen it's a change of an inheritance now this rich young ruler I don't know how he got rich I assumed that he inherited all that he had he was pretty young somehow upon his life he was given the fast track the fast path to success amen he been given a fast path to success something how he become very successful in life even given a lot something that a lot of people didn't have but here Jesus is discerning his heart and says you're still lacking the best things you have a natural inheritance on earth but I am trying to get over to you how to become a son or a daughter of God he was giving him a better inheritance but because he couldn't let this inheritance go he couldn't receive the inheritance over here now we in hindsight would look at this man's choice and think oh how foolish he wouldn't leave this inheritance behind to go receive this inheritance over here Jesus says go and sell all that you have now I want to ask you dodoo does all of us have to give up all of our natural possessions in order to become a Christian do we have to sell our house and give to the poor to become a Christian do we have to quit our job to become a Christian do we have to give everything up to become a Christian now now what now let's go down to there's another example in the Gospels another man called Zacharias let's let's cord him real quick it's in Luke chapter 19 Zacchaeus went through a similar experience of the rich young ruler Luke 19 verse 8 we remember the story of Zacchaeus Toey he was not fully a believer he was a rich man he wasn't so sure about this Jesus Christ but but there was his curiosity had been piqued his curiosity had been stirred up amen and he wanted to see this Jesus he'd heard so much about Jesus Christ he knew about Jesus Christ but he also knew all about what the scribe said about him he knew what the Pharisees said about him but he also knew what the crowd said about him and he just wasn't sure where to place this Jesus Christ in history where to place him in the kingdom of God what position does Jesus Christ have in the kingdom of God he did not know Amen and so he and he's like well I just want to see him I want to see him in action I've heard so much about him I just want to go say well that's a good thing to do amen come and see taste and see a man so he come down to verse 8 there he's up in the tree there and Jesus had looked up to him and says come down out of that tree for I must eat at your house at your supper at your house tonight and he came down he received him joyfully amen and Jesus and sitting there a table and in verse 8 Zacchaeus after he's talked with Jesus so much so long he catches a revelation of Jesus Christ and he stands up while he's at the meal and he says Lord behold the half of my goods I give to the poor if I've taken anything from any man my false accusation I'll restore it to him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day salvation has come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham for the Son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost now what took place at the supper at this meal is that sheis wasn't so sure about this Jesus being the messiah but after he had experienced him I don't know what all was said at that meal I have no idea what was taking place but he had seen enough he had seen enough and something so inspired Zacchaeus in Ulsan he stands up he says Lord the half that I have I give to the poor now the rich young ruler the Lord had told him if you give up everything you'll have eternal life but here's that Kia says I give up half and Jesus looks at it says eternal life has come to this house salvation has come to this house now it wasn't the act of how much they gave was the fact that they had forsaken all there was something in their in their own being in their soul they'll sudden made a switch that they came from being a doubter to being on the fence - all of a sudden they just said the revela it was a revelation came into their mind Allah aha I know that this Lord Jesus is the Christ I know that he is the Messiah I know that he is the son of the Living God and when that revelation struck their mind he stood up and it caused him to forsake all just like Abraham when when God appeared unto Abraham in Tara's house something that revelation struck him he says that's it I give up my inheritance I give it all up I give it up and I'm gonna follow Jehovah everywhere he goes I'm gonna do what Jehovah said to do Amen it was st. it was a kiss that Rev late when he was sitting at the meal alson that revelation struck his mind he said that's it I give it all up I am going to I'm gonna I'm gonna make a restoration for the things that I have done wrong I am gonna give to the poor I'm gonna make all my wrongs right and I'm gonna follow this Lord Jesus Christ it was the revelation made a change in his life when it was to reveal when Jesus Christ was revealed unto Him he changed his direction amen it was by the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ it was by the revelation of Jehovah and that's how God has done it all throughout history the changing point in the people's lives came when Christ was revealed to them when Jehovah was revealed to them you can come to this church day-in day-out you can pay your tithes you can do all kinds of things but it will do you no good until Jesus Christ is revealed personally to you amen you yourself have to stand where between you and Christ alone it has to be you Christ revealing himself unto you now let's go back to win-win Joe when Abraham was safe they meant we were talking about that Abraham was say before the foundation of the world but that calling caused visitations cause visitations a man in God and Jehovah kept revealing himself into him he'd visit him and he revealed to him he'd visit to him and he'd revealed to him he'd visit him in he'd reveal a bit more to a man there kept coming revelations upon revelations upon revelations upon revelations and the same experience needs to come to you there must be revelations unto you you God has to be revealed to you Christ has to be revealed to you I mean as eyes tell us someone who works the other day I says you know the word religion scares me amen I just I don't understand I understand there's a lot of people in this world that are religious but but I have not been called so many times religion has to do with a doctrine you have to follow this set of rules here or this set of rules here this set of rules here and you take your pick of which particular set of doctrines you want to follow on and when you start following that said doctrines men will call you religious a man you can follow the Buddhist doctrines or the or the Hindu doctrines or you can follow the the Christian Lutheran doctrines or the or the Catholic doctrines or maybe there's you know if someone says you're religious it can mean a many things a man but God has not called me just to be religious God has called me to reality amen and I'm not here to just follow a set doctrines but I'm here to follow that which is real amen our reality that transcends all the foolishness of this world I I'm not here to follow one certains doctrines or one certains I want to follow that which is real amen there is a reality that transcends what mankind is thinking amen and it is a reality that it comes from the creator of the heavens on earth and that is what I have come to be amen I have come to this earth to be whatever it was that Jesus Christ had on his mind when he was dying upon that cross a man when Jesus was dying hung upon that cross the world didn't want him amen amen heaven put him down upon the earth the earth picked him up and put him back up in the heavens Amen they didn't want him but I have received him amen and whatever was that was in his mind that's what I am here on this earth to be a man and he has revealed himself to me and I have forsaken all I have forsaken all amen Abraham had a chance an opportunity to receive the inheritance of his father Terah but he forsook it and left it behind and that caused a visitation it caused a visitation amen now let's go back forward to Genesis again through these visitations each time a little bit more was revealed unto Abraham after Abraham had displayed Christ by going after his fallen brother it caused a visitation and that's when milk it he met Melchizedek the mayor of God's inheritance the mayor of God's land he was the mayor of Jerusalem the center of God's inheritance he meant and this milk his attack was God in the flesh amen and when he had received this visitation milk his neck declared the Abraham was no longer the son of Terah but he was Abram and Genesis 14 19 he said and he blessed him he said blessed be Abram not of Terah but of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth so now a changes were made he's no longer a son and daughter of man but he's a son and daughter of God amen every single one of us has to come to that same revelation that you are no longer a son and daughter of mr. mrs. sweetie a man or a solder and daughter of mr. mrs. Wilgus a son or daughter mr. mrs. Curtis amen but you are now a son and a daughter of God amen you and because you are a son and daughter of God you have forsaken all inheritance of this world and receive the inheritance of up on high amen all things are yours you have inherited all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus according to Ephesians 1 amen blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and as soon as that happened the king of autumn came up to Abram and said I want to give you a reward for your acts upon the earth I want you to give our reward from Sodom amen and Abram in verse 21 that's a three-day says and the king of Sodom said Abraham give me the persons and take the goods to thyself a maze trying to give them a reward inheritance because Abram had gone down and saved Sodom while he was saving his nephew amen and in verse 22 watch this he had an opportunity not just he had already forsaken the the inheritance of his father Terah but now here comes sought I'm trying to give him a new inheritance they meant and now he and he rejects that inheritance and he says and Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord unto Jehovah the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet and I will not take anything that is thine lest you should say I have made abram rich amen I will not take now look as after he'd already forsaken his father's inheritance now here comes Sodom trying to give him another inheritance another natural narrative it even so comes with us nor do we worry sate forsake the things of our parents but now all the world crowds around us of Hollywood and Sodom and Gomorrah and the joys and riches of this life tries to crowd around us and tries to make us another rich young ruler upon the earth Amen we have to forsake that we have to forsake all amen now like I said no no no in the it no why is it that that God told the rich young ruler you have to sell everything but Zacchaeus only had to sell half the answer was to get eternal life but God required the rich young ruler to get to sell everything but he was like but when Zacchaeus said I'm going to give half of what I have jesus says eternal life has come to this house why the difference because it wasn't about how much they gave it was about whether they had forsaken everything or not and when God perceived that Zacchaeus had forsaken all he had laid everything behind all sudden it clicked this man is a son of Abraham yeah and that's what Jesus said this day salvation has come to Zacchaeus house for he also is a son of Abraham but the rich young ruler was naturally a son of Abraham but when he wouldn't forsake all he was declaring I am NOT a son of Abraham even as even in John chapter 8 when Jesus was talking to the Pharisees they say we be not born of fornication well Abraham is our Father and Jesus said if you are of Abraham your father you would do the works of Abraham under they said we have one father even God he says if God was your father you would do with the works of Abraham or you do the works of God but now you're trying to kill me a man who has shown you the truth God didn't do this Abraham didn't do that and he says you are of your father the devil and they say oh no we can show our lineage we can show going all the way back he says but you're not doing the works therefore you are of your father the devil and so is it so with every single one of us God takes us to a testing point to see if we will forsake all or not amen and that's when the time comes he'll seal to you salvation has come to this house they are a son and daughter of the Lord Jesus Christ they are not just a born of of their natural parents but now they're a son and daughter of God amen as he said I think is in John chapter 1 he says and now he came and he preached unto him and he gave them power to become sons and daughters of God amen now let's keep going here in Genesis 14 he said I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth that will not take from you and after these things in John and 15 one says the Lord came unto Abram in a vision said fear not Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward everything that God was now he had come he'd come full circle God was his reward but what happened it happened after the visitation of milk is a deck now who was milk is a deck milk his deck was the ministry of Jehovah to Abraham in the flesh amen he milk his addict was the mayor of Jerusalem in the midst of God's inheritance God had placed a man a body of flesh there that was that has the Bible said he had no beginning of days and no ending of life amen it was God in the flesh in Abraham's inheritance amen God had put his spirit in that body amen and he came and ministered unto Abraham and it says there that right after the ministry milk his neck that he gave a tithing of all let's read that in Genesis 14 18 and milk isn't a king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest and the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the Most High God which have delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all and at this point in the visitation at this this revelation is given to Abraham caused Abraham to pay his tithe to the minister God was ministering to - to Abraham and revealing to Abraham he was revealing to Abraham who he was and that when that revelation struck him it caused him to pay his tithing the revelation caused him to bring his tithe into that place and that is what began God's like I said we were appreciating tithes and offerings now that I'm finally here that was the beginning of tithing there upon the earth when the revelation were the place where the revelation was given forth amen now let's turn over to the Book of Numbers numbers chapter 18 number is 18 verse or verse 20 now I remember where we are in this chapter just an overview God gave that land as an inheritance to Abraham Abraham lived in that land and gave it as an inheritance to his sons and to his son sons and his sons Sons Abraham's family in the time of Joseph was taken out of the inherit of the promised land for 400 years and they were brought back into the land by Moses with a mighty hand and God is showing them this is how I want you to live in your promised land in the end your inheritance amen and so when they're coming back into the land he has to bring back the revelation this is your inheritance this land is your inheritance and I have given this land as an inheritance to the twelve sons of Jacob amen and to each of those families this land is given as an inheritance and had to go through the land he wrote in books and they said this portion of the land goes unto unto Judah this portion of the land would go into Benjamin Amen just all the sons were given their portion of land but when you come to numbers chapter 18 verse 20 and it says and the Lord spake unto Aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them I am thy part and ngayon heritance among the children of Israel now God has always taught the Jews that if they are not in the land of Israel that they have no part of Jehovah without them actually being in the Land of Israel that is their inheritance if they find themselves outside the land they don't even they are taught they don't even have eternal life unless they are a part of the land they have to be a part of that land that was the the teaching for generation to generation of generation amen they had to be a part of that land even as a Joseph made them swear their day in Egypt don't you bury me here in Egypt put my bones up because someday were going back to the inheritance bury me in the land bury me in the land amen and then when Jesus Christ died on the cross all of them received their inheritance when the when the earthquake shook the graves were open and there was a resurrection took place of the Old Testament Saints and they were seeing walking about the earth amen why cuz that was their inheritance it was given to him as an inheritance amen but all of them was given an inheritance a man there to enjoy that land but the sons of Aaron and the Levites were told right here you will have no inheritance in the land you know in some ways I could almost see that be disappointing you know when I was first going it like what do you mean oh we came here we came here to enjoy our joy the crops to to to do all these things to have a right to have a place where we can establish walls and boundaries and have a place upon the earth this is our house I'll pass this down on to my children my children's children and all these things but he says right there you shall have no inheritance you shall have no part among them he says I Jehovah am Naya part and nine inheritance and behold I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel it's verse 21 for an inheritance he's talking about the tithing the tithing was the inheritance of the Levites for their service which they serve even in the service of the tabernacle of the congregation neither must the children of Israel henceforth Knight of the tabernacle the congregation let's say bear a sin and die but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear the iniquity and shall be a statute forever throughout your generations among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance but the tithes of the children of Israel and that which they offer as a heave offering unto the Lord I will give to the Levite to inherit therefore I have said unto them among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance the Levites have to become fools for Christ a mint they have to forsake even their own inheritance among the the beat the people amen and become fools for Christ as we read there in current in Corinthians where Paul said we are weak but you are strong we are poor but you are a rich we are despised but you reign as kings we have become fools for Christ the offscouring of the earth they men while you reign as kings amen they have no inheritance but the ties were given to them by God as an inheritance the ties were not given by the people to the Levites no the ties were given but from God to the Levites as an inheritance it was just to pass through the hands of the people from the blessings that they received as an increase throughout the year so as they get as they were given an increase throughout the year of all their crops all everything that they did of their crops and of their of their hurts they would mark out a tenth of it and bring it to the Levites where the Word of God would come forth where the revelation would come forth and they would bring the tenth into the household Lord as a tithe God gave this to me and I have forsaken everything and as a token of that forsaking I bring my ties to the Levites showing that I am a son and daughter of Abraham now what was the job of the Levites God had a place in the middle of in the middle of their inheritance a place where they could go and if they had sinned if there was something wrong in their household whoever was they could bring they could bring the the sacrifice and they could pray to God and are then they say Lord and then Andy and the Levite would enter and with them with their sacrifice and in agreement with them amen and reveal Christ to them it was a point where Christ the sacrifice would be revealed to them amen let's turn over to the book of Ephesians chapter 4 you all had someone asked me once it's a Christian brother I think he was a little discouraged it been a while since he had seen a move of God in his life and and he was just a little discouraged and he came to me and he said in the Old Testament if a man wanted to hear from God or if he had sinned something or he wanted healing or deliverance or anything he could just take a lamb from his flock and take it to the tabernacle door and the priest would meet him there and there in the midst of their sacrifice he could walk away and have a confidence that God has heard his prayer and the man asked me says is it just that easy in the New Testament I'll never forget that he wanted some type of assurance because in the Old Testament it was so tangible you had your lamb you had your grains you had your crops you could feel them you could touch them you could carry them bleeding you can lead them with the rope all the way to the tabernacle door you could watch them as they were sacrificed you could hear the cries of a dying as the lamb died for you in your place and he wanted a confidence is it just that easy in the New Testament and there's something about it that just cries out inside of me it's easier than that for Christ died one time for once he died one time one time he had turned into the heavens for you and he is still standing there waiting for you to cry out to him he says I am standing here waiting to make intercession for you based upon your confession amen but like Abraham it has to be revealed unto us so we can forsake all hey you know and we come into a house is the worship like this so we could gather together one place so we could hear the Word of God God has ordained a ministry and he has ordained a minute I'll take our brother Isaiah our brother Isaiah he is our pastor we chose him by revelation to be our pastor amen it was revealed unto us we had many men that came to this church that are interested in being pastors over this church but when we met brother Isaiah there was something that rose up inside us and said this is the man we want to be our pastor amen and and when he became our pastor we declared that we will that he is going to give himself over to the ministry of this body of believers amen every time we have a service he is going to get down on his knees in prayer he is gonna search the scriptures and he is going to search the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ for a message for the people amen we the people have said we're gonna come into this house we are going to repent of our sins a man we're gonna believe on the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we're gonna keep our lives clean we're going to live our lives worthy of the gospel amen we're gonna keep our our households clean a worthy of the gospel and we're gonna come and gather into this place and we're gonna worship the Lord Jesus Christ and then we're gonna sit down and we're gonna listen as as brother Isaiah brings the Ministry of the gospel across the pulpit and what he says we're gonna believe amen we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna follow the vision that brother Isaiah has for this church amen because he is the pastor that guy's ordained for this church and with a vision that he has sort we're gonna line up with it and we're gonna go with him as we march towards heaven's door amen that's the ministry you know brother Isaiah went to college brother Isaiah was in the Air Force and he had a right to develop that career he had a natural right to develop that career as he went to college and whatever degree he would have gotten or as he went to the Air Force he had a right to to seek out that career to get that Weber pension he would have received or wherever a retirement plan he will receive from those careers or through the service in the military but there came a time where he the the Lord moved across his life amen in as Laura called him to enter into the ministry Amen I need oh he did he looked at his natural inheritance the things that he could have done with his life and he just wiped his hands of it Amen he wiped his hands of it he forsook everything he first took everything he says Lord I am going to enter into your ministry I am going to give my life over to ministering to the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen I'm going to give up my life the natural inheritance that I could have had the natural riches that I could have gained I'm going to give all that up and I'm going to throw myself at the mercy of the church and I'm going to live my life at the mercy of Jehovah and of the tithing of the church amen and AEA he gave up his natural career to be a minister of the gospel to the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ what a blessing and we have been blessed by that ministry I know I have I'm not the man I was before brother Isaiah came along you know I think about it because you know me and brother Isaiah and the natural have almost nothing in common you know we are completely different on different ends of the spectrum you know in the natural but in Christ we have been so United together to become brothers and we have all things common in Christ amen and the things that I was lacking God has used brother Isaiah to fulfill the missing part of me Amen God has used our pastor to to bring me up higher amen amen and it's been in this church he's made me more than I could have been and myself who did it God did it but how did he do it through much through the local ministry through brother Isaiah there are times when I'm listening to brother Isaiah preach and I'm thinking am i the Holy Spirit is speaking directly to me and I no longer see brother Isaiah anymore but it's God speaking to me right through him I know it's the truth I've seen it in action I've had God speak directly to me there's been times where I'm watching but Isaiah preached I'm like oh my he's prophesy I don't even know if he knows it but right now he is a turning it around with a spirit and he's actually prophesying well what is it it's God gave it to us as a ministry brother Isaiah if we knew the hours that brother Isaiah spins in prayer the hours he spends reading his Bible the hours and hours he spends of listening to one or two messages every single day my he has dedicated his life to the ministry of the local Bride of Christ amen amen well god bless him for that amen but God has given our brother Isaiah the local ties as his inheritance amen now what is this ministry let's read there in Ephesians chapter 4 I had you turn there Ephesians chapter 4 says it's talking here in verse 8 is talking about Jesus Christ will read verse 8 and then we'll skip down to 11 it says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive I'm glad he did that are you glad he did that I needed that I was captive but my Messiah led captivity captive he took chains and put the chains in Chains amen he took the prison house and put the prison house in prison a man he led captivity captive and then what'd he do as he was ascending up on high he turned around he gave gifts unto men God placed His Holy Ghost in the midst of the earth not only did he give his portion of the Holy Spirit each one of us but he gave a special portion of his self to the ministry to bear the word of God amen and it says what are these gifts that he gave to men now the gift is unto you and he gave some apostles why'd he give apostles for you he gave some prophets some evangelists verse 11 and some pastors and teachers why well it's for you it's for the Bride of Christ these five offices are dedicated to the ministry to the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ for what purpose why verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ we're supposed to have a strong ministry a blessed ministry a ministry that is dedicated to the gospel the to a ministry that is dedicated to the gospel into prayer and to the anointing until verse 13 until all of us until we all s patience of the ministry waiting until all wait until every single one not satisfied until every single one of us until we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God I don't into a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ unto the knowledge of the Son of God that means there has to be revelation Amen Christ has to be revealed to you through the ministry and that is our goal every time we stand behind this desk is that somehow through this ministry Christ might be revealed to you I am not satisfied until I feel like Christ has been revealed amen even I have people that I'm a witnessing to you right now amen and I am not satisfied until Christ is revealed that is what I state in my prayers whenever I'm ministering to someone Lord let let be revealed through me or let the revelation come through me Lord they got to see Christ amen because Christ is veiled to the unbelievers amen God is hiding behind a veil God has been hidden behind a veil and he cannot be seen remember the Greeks when they back in the time of Jesus they had all those different gods that they believed in but a few of those Greeks left Greece behind came to Jerusalem and they told the disciples we want to see Jesus we want to see this God that we've heard about this could become flesh but they couldn't see him because he was hidden behind the body of flesh they came they saw the body of Jesus Christ but they didn't actually see they couldn't see God they're trying to see God but it was veiled their eyes hid Christ from them but there's many people who saw Christ saying God was revealed to him amen the same thing has to happen to you you can come to this church day in day out day in day out you can hear the messages preached but if you never get behind the veil you'll never see Christ but there's gotta be something inside of you that you have to be like Abraham you have to say I'm leaving my inheritance behind I'm forsaking everything and I'm marching towards the revelation of Jehovah I'm marching towards the revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm not gonna be satisfied until Jesus Christ is revealed unto me amen the God gave the ministry that every time I come to church let me tell you I am expecting to have the the Christ or reveal to me through the pulpit I don't care if I like the minister or not you don't have to like the minister behind the desk you just have to draw Christ out of him amen why because here that's what you're here to do is draw Christ out of the minister he is there for you the minister is here to be broken for you we give our bodies as a sacrifice for you amen so that Christ might be minister to the people eat if it's not your style even it's not the way you like it you still have an opportunity to draw Christ from you I remember one time I was flying to Ohio to preach in Ohio and as I was waiting for my airplane I see coming up to my gate a Catholic priest and he was decked and everything you can expect a Catholic priest to wear he had this huge chain around his neck with this huge cross about this big and and he was just he had everything you can expect a Catholic priest to be he was Catholic to the core and I saw him I was like I'm sitting next to him I just know it I know I am sitting next to this man so I'm like Lord am I prepared to sit next to this man Lord if I was to open my mouth this man knows more than I could ever know what would you say to this man and so sure enough as I went down I sat in my seat and also I'm Washington's people come in and going down the aisle and sure enough my seats empty empty empty empty next to me and all sudden I see him come to the door and my seat next to me still empty he looks at his ticket he looks right above my head there at the little number above me and he comes up and he sits down right next to me and he gets out he reaches into his bag and he gets out this little book and he opens this book and he crosses himself and he opens up this book and it's a book that's written completely in Latin and he's reading in Latin line by line by line by line this man is a Catholic of Catholics and I'm praying I'm like Lord you've called me to be a minister of the gospel you've called me to you mister of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm going to Ohio to preach your gospel but Lord if you have anything to miss or to this man I pray Lord that you would speak to me because this man is more intelligent than I can ever be and I just we started making small talk and I told him what I was intending to do in Ohio and we were both going to Ohio to preach both of us work I started talking about it and talking about different things he believed and I started talking about a little bit that I knew about a few Pope's that I knew and I had just been reading some of the history of the early popes and and so I knew someone from the 380 400 AD and it was coming in my mind and and the Lord was this actually was refreshing my memory and I was able to speak about things that normally I wouldn't be able to speak about and I was enjoying I was having a good time and any time I meet a minister of any denomination whether it be Catholic or Mormon or anywhere in between I have a right to draw Christ from that minister I believe that I have a right to draw Christ out of that Minister it's given to me any man that claims to be a minister I have a right to draw Christ from him and so I started drawing I started trying to draw you know I couldn't get anything out of them I tried and I tried and I could not get anything out of them and by the end when the plane landed he was getting angry with me and by the time I was diced we're just I just shared with him some of the scriptures and and he looked at me in the door opened and everybody took off their seatbelts and he looked at me and he smacked me on the leg and he said good luck with that and he walked off and I was like Lord I had a right to draw from this man because I had a right to draw from the ministry and let me tell you you have a right to draw from the ministry when you come into this church and you have a right and an expectation by the Lord Jesus Christ you have been endowed with certain rights to come into this church and to be perfected by the ministry amen everything that's written on that little parameter on the wall Amen you have a right to draw that you're not drawn just for me but your drawings from Christ through me amen it's Christ ministering to you it has nothing to do with me has nothing to do with my natural body amen but Christ is here to perfect you he wants you to be perfected and to be a perfect member of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he wants you to have to add to your faith virtue he wants you to add your virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness he wants you to believe in him so much until he is so real to you then he is more real to you than the chair that you're sitting on a man the chair that you're sitting on may not actually exist but God does and that's how I believe than God amen the job that I have the people I know may not actually exist this building may not actually be here but I know that God exists I know that God is true and when people say oh I'm sick about I know there's healing in the word I'm bound by Noah's deliverance in the word amen amen I I just I believe that way recently I was watching a video of a man playing the cello I really admired it a man because I would love to be able to play an instrument any but you know this body does not know how to play an instrument but you know I looked at that man I said that man's me because if I wanted to I could ask God to play and then when God anointed me I'd play it just as well so therefore that man might as well be me playing that instrument that man is me I believe it that way that's how my faith is like brother Branham preached a message called perfect faith he says you know I think I I see he said I have a pocketknife I may have left it at home or it may be in my pocket I'm not sure it could be sitting on my dresser but right now if I had need of it I could ask God and he would place it in my pocket even if I forgot and left it at home that's perfect faith because the Bible says whatsoever things you have need up asked for him and he shall give it to you that's how I believe now if God put that in the scriptures when you pray ask believing and he will give it to you well I believe in this gospel so much until I oh but I'm willing to become a fool in believing it because I am a fool for Christ and I just I believe in that the gospel is more real to me than this building we're sitting in I believe in God that much and we are called to have that faith and I am called to have faith in God's processes and to know that his promises are true therefore if God has a ministry to bring me to perfection for the perfecting of the saints till we all come in unity then I might as well be in unity then I might as well be perfected then I might as well have virtue I might as well have knowledge I might as well have all patience it's mine it belongs to me I'm filled with patience I'm filled with deliverance you say brother do you have it all I say I do because it exists and the Bible says all things are mine therefore I have it it's mine it belongs to me it's my inheritance I've entered into it I have forsaken my natural inheritance everything that I could have possibly gained for my parents I've left that behind all the weaknesses that my parents has handed down I've laid those down all the strengths that the genetics and my parents have given me I've laid those down and I've received the strengths of my own Heavenly parent aim I've received the strengths of Jehovah all things are mine amen amen so what I need to minister to someone and I think oh I don't know how to minister to this person I don't know how to minister to that person I say but Jesus does but jesus knows how to minister to him therefore I know how to minister to him because me and Jesus have become one we've been coming United amen I have forsaken all I be united with Christ it's been revealed to me that Christ and I are one that's why I can take communion because I know that Christ and I have become one it's been revealed to me has it been revealed to you has it been revealed to you right now if they if if Mercy Hospital called me and said we're short on surgeons we need you to report to surgery in two weeks to be our love our new surgeons you know I could do it they say brother you're taking a lot upon yourself I firmly believe that I could ask God and he gets supernaturally placed that inside of me that's how much I believe in God I believe that I know who I am I've been called to be a son or a daughter of God you know Moses may not have known how to be a deliverer but he was anointed to be a deliverer amen and so have you been anointed to be the Bride of Christ you say I may not know how to be patient I may not know how to do all these things but God has anointed you to be his bride God has anointed you to live in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he's anointed you to receive all things and he's giving you this ministry to stir up your faith until you believe they meant for the perfecting of your faith amen amen and he's given the tithe to the ministry as an inheritance amen amen we want a strong local church not a weak Church a strong Church let's turn her to Deuteronomy chapter 12 we're almost done I love this chapter this whole chapter is a beautiful chapter we're going to read quite a bit of this chapter over the next 10 or 15 minutes or so and then we'll draw down to a close it says in verse 1 these are the statutes and judgments which you shall observe to do in the land which the Lord God of thy father's giveth you to possess it all the days that you live upon the earth you shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess serve their gods upon the high mountains upon the hills under every green tree and you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars you shall burn their groves with fire and he hew down graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place god wide the land to be completely delivered and cleansed because he had chosen that land to give as an inheritance to the people and he wanted him to live in that land but he did not want them to live in that land polluted by the gods that lived in that land before him amen as much as Abraham was called to leave that behind and go into that land and Abraham rejected Sodom and let any way into that land amen so these so the children of Abraham had to do the exact same thing they had to forsake everything amen even the things that naturally lived in the land when they got there now let's read four through seven it says you shall not do so like nushot worship like that you should not do so unto Jehovah your God but under the place now see the inhabitants of that land worship God upon every hill and in the groves but God wanted them to go and worship in one place he says but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation you shall socially seek and thither thou shalt come so you'll have to leave your house and go to his house I'm gonna read the last half of that again even unto his habitation there even show you seek and thither thou shalt come verse six and thither shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithe and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the first things of your herds and your flocks and there you shall eat before the Lord and you shall rejoice and all you put your hand unto and your households where in the Lord thy God shall that's blessed II so there was a place in the land where they had to leave their house behind and take their tithes and their offerings and go there and there they would worship the Lord rejoice in the Lord for all that God had done to them and there they'd offer their tithes and their offerings up in the Lord and they would do it with a thankful heart giving glory unto God for the things that God had done to them amen that was the pattern that God had instituted they meant let's go out to verse 10 but when you go over Jordan and dwell on the land which the Lord your God has given you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from your enemies round about so it's you dwell safely he's telling there will come a time when you live comfortably in the land a mint verse 11 then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there and a theater shall you bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which you vow unto the Lord and he shall rejoice before the Lord your God you and your sons and your daughters and your men servants and your maidservants and the Levite that is within your gate for as much as he hath no inheritance or no part with you take heed to your snow as - stop right there I want you to leave your place behind and I want you to take your family your whole family gather them together with your tithes and offerings and go to this place and worship amen to the place where I have placed my name now when we talk about bringing your ties to the storehouse I'm not talking about this natural building I'm talking about a place where God has given you your ministry where wherever God has given you a portion of the fivefold ministry that's where you bring your tithes and your offerings - amen so you can have a ministry as as as the disciples said why should we leave the Word of God to wait tables see cumin fill the Holy Ghost to do so for we will give ourselves over we're going to forsake all and give ourselves over to the ministry to prayer and reading the Bible amen verse 13 says take heed be careful take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offering in every place at thou seest but only but in the place which the Lord shall choose and one of the tribes there thou shall offer like burnt offerings and there they shall do all that I command thee amen one specific place not talking about the building I'm talking about where God places the ministry amen where the where the people are gathered together Paul said forsake not the assembling together together all the more as you see the Day approaching amen bring it all into one place verse 17 he says thou mayst not eat within thy gates that's your house the tithe of thy corn or if I wine or the oil or the first things that I heard so tithe of thy flock nor of any of the vows that bow us nor of thy free will offerings or heave offering of thy hand but thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose thou and thy son and my daughter and my manservant and I made sir and the Levite does within thy gates and now shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God and all that thou puttest thy hand too and now shall take heed be careful to thyself verse 19 be careful take heed to thyself but thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou liveth upon the earth why was God so careful about that because the Levites were the ones that would handle the sacrifice that would manifest the sacrifice to the people amen and he and they were come manded not taking inheritance upon the amongst the people but to forsake everything and live their lives dedicated to the sacrifice and so is the New Testament church the ministry the fivefold ministry is to dedicate themselves to the ministry to the ministry of the sacrifice to the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean so we can have a strong Ministry of people that are dedicated to bring the Ministry of Christ to the people amen and you shall not eat of your tithe or use your tithe to go over to McDonald's or to pay your phone bill or your internet bill but you bring it to the place where you worship and bring your ties there to the storehouse of the Lord amen he said be careful and how you do it Amen we want a strong local church where the ministry has the time and the effort amen to dedicate themselves to the ministry of the people those brothers I can testify you the brother Isaiah probably prays more than any man I know he has dedicated himself to the ministry amen he's decade himself to the ministry let's um I said stop there but let's turn one more let's remember to Malachi chapter 3 we have to have a place where Christ is revealed I think about that too the other day we need a place in this town to bring the unbelievers to a mint we need a place to where we do art we all have our part in the ministry we all have our part to go out unto the hedges and the highways and the byways to preach Christ to the people to reveal Christ to the people but it comes to a time where they also have to come and worship God to have a place where would we bring them we have to have a place to bring them to come and worship with us amen and that place should it be a place there's worthy amen that's why we that's why we give honor to this place it seems so weird that such a supernatural play people will give honor to a natural building but yet this is the place that we want to be a clean place a place where people can can get away from the things of the world and meet God a place that is clean comfortable as all the things you know the instruments the bills are paid placed where there are no distractions amen so the so the atmosphere could be a place where people can be born again amen now in Malachi chapter 3 let's read from verse 8 there says will it's almost seems like a silly question now kai 3:8 but says will a man Rob God that doesn't even seem possible how can people steal from God it doesn't seem like it even be possible for a man to do that you have robbed me he says but you say wherein have we robbed thee he says entice and offerings he says you are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation he says bringing all the tithes into the storehouse that there might be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saying Lord of Hosts if I will not open up to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it well I sound pretty good that the heavens would be open and he pour out a blessing and look at the next verse and after that he says I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes now we believe in a ministry where Jesus Christ said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to them that are bound healing Joe's that are captive delivers to them that are bruised bruised peace to those there - served amen we believe in that ministry amen but if we if but if we don't bring our tithes and the offerings God says he will not rebuke the Devourer for our sakes then how can we say that we believe in that type of a ministry where all things are possible when the devourer is circling our camps amen but he says even as Brandon said no church service is a true church service tolet I as an offering has been taken up a mint it's got to be it's part of the part of the true service is to where men and women they have dedicated themselves unto the Lord Jesus Christ they ain't sure into one place they've prepared themselves beforehand they've repented of their sins they come to church a little bit early and they quiet themselves in prayer and they say Lord if I've done anything wrong give me lore if I've done anything wrong wash me Lord I'm coming into the Circe now strengthen me Lord Lord when we when the worship service starts Lord I want to praise you with a clean heart I want to enter into your gates with Thanksgiving I want to enter into your courts with praise and I want to do it with clean hands and a clean heart amen and then when the minister gets up behind the pulpit Lord you are the God that is searching my heart right now as I pray and Lord as you are searching my heart if there is anything wrong inside of me lord I pray that you would use that minister to dive down into the gospel and bring it out a manta and to preach the gospel and reveal unto me that if there's some doing something wrong show me Lord that I might live a little bit more better a little more more perfectly upon life's way a man still I might be more and more perfect I might come to the perfection of saints amen a little bit closer to Christ and so I might become to the unity of the faith where all our faith is united together and we're all in one Accord believing that all things are possible that's a church service let me tell you brother Graham said that every true church should have a book of Acts written behind it if it's a true church it needs to be writing a book of Acts behind it I believe that I believe that bring me your testimonies tell me about the book of Acts behind your life tell me about how God is leading you day-in day-out tell me about how God is leading you to be a minister of the gospel tell me about how the Holy Spirit and you have joined together in partnership amen to bring deliverance to a lost and dying world to how you are now the comforter the comforter that God promised to the people Amen Jesus Christ said I came and I died for all people say Amen I came and I died for the entire world amen but the entire world don't know yet until you tell a man until you reveal to them Christ crucified amen and we ought to have a place to bring them so they can also come and be strengthened a man in that place is made strong through the ties and the offerings amen a ministry that doesn't have to worry about where it's gonna get his next meal from if it's gonna be able to make its house payment or not but a strong ministry that has dedicated itself to prayer and reading the gospel and the 19 of this last day a man knows where the Holy Spirit wants to go day-in day-out he doesn't have to worry about this or worry about that but he's dedicated his life to the gospel sake and his natural needs are given to him as an inheritance and when you don't give the tithes and offerings you Rob God how is that possible because it's not you that gives your ties God already gave your tithing to the ministry and when you withhold it then you are robbing God why because God gave them an inheritance of the tithing and so the tithing is an inheritance from their father to the fivefold ministry and but it goes through your hands he blesses you upon your life's journey he gives the increase a man as he gives you your increase upon the earth and you mark the 10th of it oh that increase and you bring it to the house of the Lord in worship and praise and rejoicing with your children your children's children and your sons and your daughter's your husband your spouse and you say we're going to the house of the Lord today we're going to worship we're going to praise or going to give our tithes and our offerings unto the Lord and we're going to do it with our joyful heart and then we're going to hear from the ministry we're going to be perfected and we're going to be perfected in the Saints amen and we're going to join to ourselves together in the unity of the faith and we're going to walk out of the door a little bit closer to the Lord amen there's a church service for you a man I believe it's possible it's mine a church services mine it belongs to me as an inheritance and when I part those curtains I come in expectation because all those things are mine they belong to me I'm not going outside of this room without becoming a little bit closer to Christ amen I'm not leaving this room without becoming a little bit closer to Jesus Christ and I'm not leaving this room without a revelation of Jesus Christ because it's given to me as an inheritance amen amen but God said you are robbing God when you withhold your tithes and offerings because I already gave it to the ministry as an inheritance and when you hold it back then you were robbing God because it wasn't yours to begin with God gave it to you the hundred percent and he asked you to take the tenth of it and pass it right on down to the ministry amen so if God has given you a visitation like Abraham does if God has given you a visitation and revealed himself to you then you are given a church service to worship and praise Him with me that's part of the visitation Abraham was given a visitation he was visited there in Earth and told come out he was visited there in in in in the promised land saying I am giving you this whole land he's given a promise he was visited again by Melchizedek and said and said that I have given you you are now a son and daughter of God and you are now possessor of heavens and earth and Abraham responded to revelation by giving ties and so now we as sons and daughters of Abraham we are identified because we've been called out of the world we've forsaken everything we've gone into this gospel way amen we've been receiving visitation after visitation Christ in this last day has been revealed to us we know who he is we know what he stands for we know that all things are possible and we've responded and we've proven that we are sons and daughters of Abraham by coming into this Church and having a full church service and part of that is paying our tithes and offerings unto Jehovah paying our tithes and offerings to the Lord Jesus Christ we're testifying that we are sons and daughters of the Living God sons and daughters of Abraham and heirs according to the promise and we are possessors of all things amen and he is rebuking the Devourer for our sakes amen I believe that so if the Devourer is in your life right now if you look at your household and you see the works of the Devourer in your household he will rebuke it for you if you're being obedient to the Word of God amen so identify those areas in your household well with your maidservants with your man's service with your sons with your daughters or whoever it is identifies the areas of your household where the devourer is working and say let us go to the house of the Lord let us go to the place of God's deliverance let us play go to the place where God has chosen to place his name to place his ministry we're gonna go there we're gonna worship the Lord we're gonna praise his God we're gonna bring our tithes and our offerings we're gonna bring our sons and daughters we're gonna worship God and He will rebuke the Devourer for our sakes and we will be delivered and we will be saved amen and we will have a shirt or a house that has the peace of God that passes all understanding do you believe it's possible like I said it like the man with the cello that man might as well be me because it exists and it's possible and all things are mine therefore it might as well be me therefore it is me amen if there is a possibility of a household or the devourers are buked or the sicker may eat well amen and people are living in you at you as Christ Jesus then it might as well be my household because it's possible and it might as well be your household if you can enter into that same faith and claim those things as yours amen amen let's just close right there Amen let's just stand we've been given an inheritance and that inheritance is perfection that heritance is Christ that inheritance is God himself he isn't our inheritance a man coming to the house of the Lord let receive it lay all those things behind don't be like the rich young ruler but of a true and honest heart forsake all he has an inheritance for you to give you all things amen amen you can experience it amen amen brother if you'd come let's just bow our heads and word prayer Heavenly Father long message maybe I may have tired the people out a little bit forgive me Lord my dazing wrong the Lord you know my heart Lord and my desire father is that the people would hear from you that they would receive your revelation and so lower we give ourselves to you right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we dedicate our lives again once more unto you Lords we decide we don't want to be like the rich young ruler Lord who looked you in the face he looked you in the face but he just couldn't forsake all he didn't know that there was a blessing in it the Lord Zacchaeus was not like that Zacchaeus saw you looked at you in the face he caught that revelation if I leave my inheritance behind my natural heritage and I receive Christ I'll receive a blessing that yours itself cannot contain they said Lawrence I've done everything wrong I'll make it right if I've stolen anything I'll restore it four times over the half that I have I'll give to the poor whatever you want Lord everything I own is yours I give it to you I am yours and Zacchaeus placed himself upon the altar and so do we have to do we have to place ourselves upon the altar and force a carrot and come to the Lord Jesus Christ Here I am Lord I gave it my all to you I give up my own natural be my own unnatural thoughts the Lord I know that I've been given an inheritance that is greater than easing this life to give to me and I know that isn't is possible to inherit it therefore I cling therefore it's me because it's possible I claim this mine you call me Lord storm a train too if I will be my my faith says it's mine and I clean it because you said I couldn't or you gave me permission to claim it so here I am i claiming the lord let me go forth Lord let me be that minister of the gospel the best or the tape moondyne to let them know that healing is here deliverance is here all things are here all things are possible to them that believe because you pay the price thank you Lord for all things we give ourselves unto you we are
