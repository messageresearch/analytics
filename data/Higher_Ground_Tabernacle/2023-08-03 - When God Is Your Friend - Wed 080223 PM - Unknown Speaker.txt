turn with us to Philippians 1 practice 21 verse in Philippians 3 7 through 10. Philippians 1 Philippine 21 for to me 4242 mean to live is Christ amen and to die is gained Philippians 3 Philippians 7 through 10 verses you there amen what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ amen Massachusetts you're doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I might may win Christ and being found in him and not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith which verse 10th verse that I might know him I found the connector Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death and did not confirm some more one more scripture and I'll let you be seated God is good to us amen bear with me just a moment I thought I had a scripture there James Jacques 23-26 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God and sister accomplished you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rehab the holy justified by works when she had received the messengers and had set them out another way for as the body without spirit is dead so faith without works is dead Hallelujah let us pray please Heavenly Father we come before you Lord thank you for your goodness and your grace that's my service in a special way finishes fill our hearts with your Divine love that we will not only love each other we will love your word we will love you God help us now in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen amen you may be basically about friends and everybody has a friend hopefully anyway it's a spell but as we have heard in the songs you know brother Brandon was not only a prophet but brother Brandon was a friend of God hallelujah and even the bride the memory poos she has been called the friend of God Amen now when you are friends the definition of a friend like definition is a person whom one knows and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection person affection typically exclusive of sexual or family relations exclusive the the sexual sexual if the relation family Hallelujah but if you've ever had a good friend man she was a you know a good friend sticks closer than a brother we now I want to say tonight in order to be a true friend of God you've got to sell all that you have is that right that's right we know the story of the Rich Young rulers he came to Jesus for salvation he had done all the law right things but when Jesus Christ asked him one day to give everything he had and follow him it was too much to ask for we look at this Rich Young Ruler as if it's a strange story this man would not follow Jesus he was not willing to sell all [Music] does it put you in the same position [Music] [Music] oftentimes people say I'm a Christian but then there is no life behind him y'all hear what I'm saying Christianity is not a social club it is not something that you join is anybody become a member in order to be a Christian you must be born again y'all hear what I'm saying Christianity the Christianity has to be lived is that right that's right in the question and answer all three 1964. I've got to live that example Christianity is is what you Christianity ain't what you say look it's what you live what you do circle is an example is it an example you're the sword of the Earth amen amen now all of us are guilty but in order to be a friend of God you must obey the law you got to give to Caesar you got to give to Caesar what belongs to Seasons and the prophet God said you know you may find yourself doing wrong way you you you confess Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in our revelation is unto the Lord is that right that's right brother man who tells a story in that same message he talks about a woman about you in first husband was a drunkard and they were discussing that they had never seen a Christian before you know and this drunk man said it's the strongest my wife and if you don't believe me foreign the man said to his wife with his friends fix me some food I always prepared to you fix me some eggs and ham and she fell right into it and she said yes I'll go fix you some eggs and ham Hallelujah now he prepared she prepared the meal for all of them Hallelujah but when he the husband God his meal are you stronger he said these eggs are bad you know they threw all the food on the tape the floor and everything Hallelujah go fix me some more uh she says oh no honey I'll go fix you some more and I just passed for him um and he said well you knew I didn't like eggs like that hey like you just did that just to be doing it he and his buddies walked out the house [Music] because she was a friend of God hallelujah amen she obeyed the word of God hallelujah bless those who curse you could understand that despitefully use and team amen amen amen we're built upon Revelation built upon Revelations one thing about Christianity you cannot fake it [Music] if it's not in you it can't come out of you Hallelujah amen and when you see yourself fail remember the blood of Jesus Hallelujah God always away for us to get it right Hallelujah having God as a friend I mean you don't have to worry about nothing even people people spoke evil to brother Branham he didn't have to fight them Hallelujah and when you are a friend of God absolutely absolutely Hallelujah and if you don't pray for those that offend you and Siri was a false they will be in great trouble with God the Bible said be careful you know if you think the least of these though Romeo Stone about your neck a stone about your neck and cast yourself into the sea hey Hallelujah is that all right that's right see uh we we look at the scripture and we talk about faith in the message faith without works is dead together with with Paul revelation of Faith as Paul said you don't need words you can't say I'm a Christian and there is visible that's the token if he is in you she said oh he becomes visible [Music] when you're born of God Hallelujah [Music] coming from if you're no faith without works thou have faith with his works and by faith and by works was was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled with said Abraham believe God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called [Music] [Music] by works a man [Music] Hallelujah you know they got you caged in here you know Hallelujah they got they have us caged in here Paul says one thing Paul do you ensures James says another yes and brother Brandon said find the middle of the road foreign right amen the faith in you life the Revelation in you will cause you to do whatever you can but of course [Music] hallelujah amen is that all right yes now first thing she looked like Paul was speaking in Romans the fourth chapter justifying Abraham by faith and James is justifying him by words hey exactly because but it does not contradict Paul was speaking what God saw in Abraham and Jane was speaking what man saw in there I don't take away your testimony that's what God is looking at it's like a jewelry guy but if I if you tell them you've got things that's how I know Hallelujah amen oh see you either for God or you are against him you know that there's no middle ground you either for God with that church or you're not for God and the only way you can be for God don't you you understand this but those who do not believe God they are the enemy of God Hallelujah brother random said it like this you either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside the Expressions many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy ghosts I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no you can have the baptism every hour in your life go to hell the Bible says that's exactly right now if you didn't know what brother Brandon was talking about this man is made of Air Buddies [Music] Hallelujah he goes on in modern events made clear by prophecies we find today that people there are many people just can't believe it yeah even Spirit-filled people memories I'm going to give you one that show [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] she heard what Jesus said [Music] she had representation and Hallelujah have ever seen Williams that has been ordained by God to believe y'all understand what I'm saying if God is going to preach a word he needs somebody to believe it and he ordained us Hallelujah that's going to think about it in Israel all they had to do is believe Moses just follow what Moses they do Hallelujah and then you had Dayton and you had Cora raised up God didn't send us a Dayton generals Christ revealed himself remember Hallelujah [Applause] that's your friend he's my savior he's my deliverer but he's my friend and he's the kind of friend amen listen brother abandonment question and answers I just put a next paragraph um 280. Hallelujah he goes on to say he needs to see who is your little Queen in the home here she ministers food to you yeah what you're late what you're late on now so when she but when she minutes to you that's what the bride ministers to Christ the word you get what he's saying he's taking the natural food we Minister Amen [Music] to Christ that's your husband say welcome Marie Hallelujah listen he said that's what the bride ministers to Christ the word man shall not live by bread alone but every word Minister ministers the word to the king here it goes manifesting his promised word in the age that she's living in manifestations I feel like shout right now by living it um ministering to him when we see Miracles God give you Grace to overcome Hallelujah he placed us here it was a blessing you see oh my [Laughter] [Music] [Music] on his behalf [Music] [Applause] so when you heard this message [Music] Grandpa and by doing something God calls Abraham oh my God Amen have mercy on us amen so I want you to understand those whose names were on the Book of Life we're stand in the judgments because they failure amen and did you know even when God calls us a friend and we still mess up God took Saul made him a king and then Saul backslid on God hallelujah we would have looked this song you saw you going to hell but that was not the Judgment of God somebody help me here Samuel the prophet aside from the gray oh this day you'll be with me Hallelujah [Music] so when we definitely walk Disobedience thank God for repentance thank God for the Mercies but because of his grace Hallelujah Matthew 22. thank you Matthew 22. are reading at the 12th verse I don't know about you I want to hear him say Well well done Beyonce I want to hear him say Well done foreign [Music] hither me not having a wedding garments was speechless he called him friends and here he was see we take advantage of friendship uh [Music] sometimes we can take uh what's the advantage and and and and and and and the thing is he is like okay you've been invited Nico yeah MVD I invited you remember everything they were all invited but some of them were dollar Tory yeah man uh getting things right Hallelujah and and little listen they had basically become worldly is it Patrick because when you run out of oil what else can you do yeah you're influenced by the elements of the world the 13th verses then said the king to the servants find him hand and foot leave [Music] [Music] y'all understand y'all hear what I'm saying the foolish version please [Applause] [Music] but they failed to do what he told them to do something make sure you've got the Holy Ghost In Yourself quiet I'm gonna read this as a long quote so just introduction along Hallelujah my goodness yes coming up this is this is still from let me see make sure that I'm reading it right yeah this is from question and answer still questions yeah 1964 part three another book was open and that was the book of life and those who had their name on The Book of Life had to be judged out of the book Judas is Garrett professed to be a believer wow and he had his name written among them on the Book of Life is that right that's right he claimed to have eternal life and his name was put on The Book of Life he has to be judged in to see why did he condemn the word of life then [Music] in other words [Music] silly [Applause] you know what I'm saying [Music] God has given every one of us talents yes sir right some sells out to be a Methodist Baptist or what more sold out this position from The Book of Life I support you supposedly and he judged you have to be he'll be stand there and be judged and judged by that by the word that's why Judas had to do it you had to come to the Judgment his name was on the Book of Lies but that don't mean he says he has to understand the Judgment sleeping virgins will stand right there under the same thing Jesus said in Saint John 24. he that he with my word that he that can receive it says Just Hear It preach and go on and says [Music] my words [Applause] [Music] he was condemned because he did he did because what he he do of course the second Faith he sold out his birthrightness Hallelujah so what are you saying Brother Bruce when your achievements in this world to you than getting money God said is yours I don't have to do that sensation where all your emotions shoes amen amen yes sir I'm going too fast sorry I'm sweating though Hallelujah Listen People I say these things and I'm enjoying this word um but I've seen God in so many ways recently I'm pretty sure I see it's love like I've never seen it before and I know God requires me to give that love to everyone it's just like a dream exists Esau was born in a family with the promise of God is the oldest son had the birthright um by a promise of God is our name was on the book of for the birthright is that right but he swapped it for a Miss of wild gourds maybe elections uh [Music] um and play the course hungry to feel his belly uh he swapped Birthright for a military he likes songs shut down these places right now we're not hungry but when you're hungry that's a different story I'm not talking about hungry and you just ate a few hours early I'm talking about days without eating is that right that's funny what did the devil say to God I'll get job to curse you to your face he says skin for skin what would a man give for his life just let me have him foreign [Music] [Music] like I heard somebody say she had the devil All In Her Eyes Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I don't say nothing else let me say this Everybody Must Die right and this life and since we is no comparison no no matter how much you suck foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know how they sell you know how they sold out right they say we can't do it it's too much saying we can't do it like people say Elijah's way is so is too straight hallelujah thank God for the narrow way I see people even in this message so much time with this keep us this thing gonna fade it's gonna get old um oh Beauty It's Gonna Change [Music] eternity Hallelujah Jesus said is this with you and Paul's speaking with the inspiration of Christ in Hebrews 6. for it is impossible for those who were enlightened every minute and when made partakers of the Holy ghosts every tasted of the power of the world to come on to renew themselves again into repentance seeing that they crucified themselves the Son of God count the blood of the Covenant an Unholy thing as um um Unholy I don't believe the message anymore [Music] when you get to that place walk away of the goodness there is no more repentance you can't even come back that's pretty bad isn't it what he would have tried to find Jesus yeah yeah like I heard somebody says he went to the high priests everyone beside Joshua and Kayla died hello embarrassing that Wilderness they were Believers yet their names what is it not going all the way that's right Satan is doing everything he can he can do and so don't forget to make you satisfied with religion [Music] you and I have come to this message Hallelujah this is not a patched up job God said we are New Creations [Music] and we must see the new change the word of God we've got we have it the Lord delivered to brother Brandon um hallelujah how do you know come on when you believe it because when the word brain Corrections yeah Lord we know a lot of people are fooling themselves in this message you know because they say well we know brother Brandon is a prophet is against uh the uh uh uh Branham Tabernacle because they become too starchy and he says no no no no you see you got you got to go beyond and let you know I don't know it's a revelation you've got to go beyond [Music] if the statue of a perfect man right Hallelujah can I go just a little further yeah Hallelujah just a little bit do I continue Paul speaking Paul ADI if a man ever come to a spot that he's been saved and Sanctified the blood Sanctified Hebrews 13 12 and 13. says that the blood sanctifies and then comes right up to the gate of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and because of prestige or denominational refuses to walk in it with the denominations he says indeed that person is lost says person can never be saved for he doesn't spite even to the memory of Grace that called him out to that place I'm showing it to him and then turn around walk away from it he counsel the blood of the Covenant but he was crucified was crucified as an Unholy thing because the blood that saved him Sanctified brings him up to the Baptist of the Holy Ghost and then walks away and let me bring it down to our little uh so many people in the message just to teach it away from us um I know as you're saying there's something wrong because the people don't love each other y'all hear what I'm saying and only those the Bible said they will know you are my disciples because of the love of course you have one girl I'm not trying to scare anybody if you love me it is that 11. [Music] [Music] 8 3 11. okay so Luke he's talking about a good friend okay I'm leaving on this one I say it to you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend because of his opportunity consistent knocking is an opportunity he will rise and give him as many as he needed I sell to you would he asked the Monday and it shall be giving you seek share and it shall be open unto you everyone that asketh receive it and he that seek it find it and to him that knock it hey amen if Versace as bread of any of you that his father will give him a stone see redone Japan or if he asked a fish well she's the one in poisson will he for a fish give him a serpentine the call the answer that question is no no hallelujah hallelujah there's so much I wanted to say but yeah man I'll say this by the grace of God God has been so good to us we've seen him as a lawyer we've seen him as Savior the one very common last come to know him as a friend amen you become the enemy of God doesn't mean you're lost but I would not take chances because if you really love God you'll keep his Commandments coming from identification he said did you know when you get more education and more culture approach the culture did you know that that that's what side it puts you on some people can say he said it puts you on the devil's side the Bible said that like people just the children of the darkness larger than the ones of the life so it ain't all that uh if you don't get that yeah you put God first you love the Lord amen you put him first with all that you get all right just so you'll know do I have time for one more quote just one more just inside okay this is really a good one because so many people say they're a friend of God and they won't even come to church and the Bible said when you see that day approaching and I believe they come over come from the question and answers part three questions they misunderstood brother random on some things he says no you're mistaken see let me go over and just answer it as a come by he said do you teach that the bride must not attend any other Church unless you are preaching preaching or else or otherwise the Tabernacle like insurance folks he said no I don't teach that I don't believe that I do not believe it now this is the listen to what your Prophet our Prophet says 1964. we've got ministers sitting here that's that's scattered all around through the country and I believe they are a part of the Bride I believe that a man or woman from can go to church anywhere they want to go away if they don't teach the word whole words you can't go to church any other place where do they teach the whole word [Music] until you can get to where they teach the homework going to church wherever you do that Hallelujah and he didn't say we got tapes everywhere that are part of the Bride preachers [Music] obedient yes thank you Lord amen Hallelujah God is so good to us there's some things I jumped yesterday it's okay we'll come back around on Christmas and we'll be here Sunday by the grace of God so I trust it I'll be coming come in as as early as you possibly can yeah just felt because because I live in yeah Hallelujah because that's obedience too Oscars some of you can't help it I'll do your transportation situation for those of you who can help me and then you drag yourself around and we'll listen not get here on time because brother Brandon said we ought to be here a half hour early he loved the Lord amen he's our friend I don't want to stand on it on the enemy's side it will always be on the um we'll see what what God would have us speak on this coming Sunday but I wish that everybody could come encourage those who don't normally come I want them to be here Sunday a special word for everybody you love God I appreciate your patience I know you guys some of you work during the week and whatever I know that's pretty rough I really appreciate it and I do try to not to be I left my watch but I get
