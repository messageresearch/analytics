doing you are here as an individual to worship god and to appreciate his goodness and to thank him for all that he's done for you we have a few elders here besides myself but we thank god for those of you who made it out to support uh the meeting by the grace of god before i forget also after which after we the preaching and all um we're going to have a brief meeting after service to discuss some ideas on things that we we desire to to do during the summer time as far as missionaries as far as collectively as a group by god's grace we thank god for those of you who have pressed your way down or up uh from uh iowa city matter of fact you were more on time than the ones from des moines were uh but we do appreciate your coming um we thank you for uh all your sacrifices and things that you uh make when you do come this way we have a wonderful brother uh here this morning we've known him since he was a little boy or was associated with him since he was a little boy he's still a little boy but yeah uh our brother uh timothy matthews a man who uh we met at harmony in the desert he and his sisters and mom and all dad singing and praising god so i do know one thing about timothy he he loves the fire of god and i trust that you pull on the gift truly i was expecting with all the preparation we made that we would have more people come out to the youth services but one thing i do know you can't set a person to file only god can do that and uh but we do think thank the lord for those of you who are uh stimulated by the revelation of this message as uh brother come we're going to sing there's power in the blood uh one to work in power there is power power in the blood [Music] there [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] blood of the lamb [Music] [Music] there's wonderful power in the blood well there is our power wonder working power [Music] in the precious blood of the lamb one more time there's power power wonder working power in the blood oh of the lamb blood of the lamb it's in the are you thankful for the blood of the lamb hallelujah [Music] just want to say thank you to brother brooks for having the confidence to invite me to ask me to to preach to you all and to stand behind the sacred desk this afternoon and we just thank the lord for his goodness and his mercies to us because without that brother sister we would be lost so we just thank the lord for that thank you musicians and just the wonderful uh spirit i feel in here just thank the lord for being with us our service would be in vain if it wasn't for the lord so amen we want to also um we bring greetings from the church back home and i'm from silver city new mexico and uh just a privilege to be here with you all and my brother isaiah said we just been acquainted with each other for some time and uh maybe just been a long time coming but anyhow we just appreciate the lord and his goodness to us so anyhow also had the privilege of being able to bring my wife and one of my little boys with me i'm standing there in the back sister carmen there and my little boy elijah we left joshua the older one back at home and brother brooks said i thought you was bringing well first he said first he said he thought i had about four or five children i said i said no no don't quite have that many in them but uh i said maybe you would see in the future so we'll see maybe maybe next time we come maybe we will have four four children anyhow all right well god bless you all if you'd be so kind as to grab your bibles and turn with me we've got a couple scriptures to read here and um aren't you happy to be in the house of the lord this afternoon my mom you know the world has all their stuff they like to do on saturdays and sundays and most of it ain't too good but there's no better place you could find yourself on any day of the week but in the house of the lord so amen all right if you would turn with me to the book of john chapter 3 we're going to read verses 1 through 7 should be a portion of scripture we're all very familiar with john 3 we're going to read verses one through seven people make fun of the way nicodemus came and the questions that he proceeded to ask jesus but you know at least he came some people don't even come you know amen read this way there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god the word see there means to understand nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee he must be born again brother we know that's jesus's first doctrine there it's one of the most important things maybe the most important thing in your christian walk is to be born again uh second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 another scripture we should all be familiar with here this afternoon second corinthians 5 17 reads this way therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature or new creation old things are passed away and behold all things are become new last scripture in the book of acts chapter 2 one of my favorite portions of scripture acts two we'll read verses one through four we know that the disciples walked with jesus for three and a half years there and saw the miracles and heard the great messages that were preached and the things that were said it's all the great events of god and yet jesus telling peter before pentecost when you are converted go strengthen your brethren we know they were not converted truly until they received the baptism of the holy ghost and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them aren't you glad the holy ghost don't miss one person and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance thank you for your patience and the word you may be seated hallelujah all right brother i'm just going to take off my jacket here all right i'd like to speak to you and of course i'm addressing mainly the young people this this afternoon i preach along these lines on pentecost and the holy ghost and the new birth sometime back and at a certain church and i won't name it and you would be shocked brother sister the amount of deacons and ministers that came up to receive the holy ghost but i don't believe you even and of course brother branham teaches it plainly and i believe every real christian should stand by this but you're not even allowed to stand behind a pulpit and minister the word of god unless you first had an experience with the pillar of fire and uh had deacons and and ministers coming up and never received the holy ghost brother this isn't even taught in most churches that this not the right way it's might be mentioned or or a phrase here about it or there was not even taught uh the way that this message brings out a new verse i'd like to speak to you this afternoon on the process of death believe the young people need to be encouraged i believe young people need to uh know how to fight and this and that but brother sister i believe a lot of things that come up in our lives and a lot of questions and problems could all be literally thrown right out the window if we just get born again a lot of the same things that we deal with over and over and over again another way i hear a lot of times people preach messages to the young people and they encourage them and they say almost like a pep rally of some sort and they get excited and then but brother just get the holy ghost and then you walk out with more victory than you had if you listen to a thousand pep rallies that week but you walk out with the holy ghost you have victory that lasts the rest of your life here on this earth so i'm going to preach on the process of death i have a little note here in the message why preaching in 1962 brother branham called the new birth a glorious mess he said the new birth brings a mess but it brings new life with it it's a mess but it's a glorious mess it brings new life the new birth experience brother sister is is is just that it's an experience it's not just shaking hands it's not just a good feeling it's not because you have a position in the church it's not because you're well good friends with the pastor it has nothing to do with any of that it's an experience with a living god making himself real to you i was preaching at the home church on wednesday brother brenham said the new birth was a revelation brother unless you have an experience god cannot reveal himself to you you must have an experience where god reveals himself to you and you know yet you're born again not because you had a good feeling run down your spine or because that you have a good friendship with the pastor or because that you have a position in the church but you know that you are born again by a revelation that god has revealed himself to you excuse me now uh this experience now i'm going to preach to you the prophets version of a new birth which is really the bible's version of a new birth and uh many people they have their pastors version their parents version their self-designed version they have satan's substitute but i want to ask you this afternoon does your experience match the bible does your experience match the word of god for this hour there's three main words that are associated that brother branham associated with the new birth the number one is mess the next word is change and the third word is death all those things must take place in order for there to be a birth and i want to tell you this afternoon that god will not fill a dirty vessel he will not fail you with the holy ghost and you've got to unconfess sin in your life all right this is where i got the title my message you must be born again preached in 1961 brother adam says yes to be born again you must go through a process of death that's right everything does well we know that a birth is is it takes three parts is that right water blood spirit justification sanctification and a baptism of the holy ghost amen you take a grain of corn if that corn ever accept expects to live again it's got to die first you got to die first you got to die die how to yourself die to everything so that you can be born again you've got to do that if you don't die you can't never live again brother people wanting to receive the holy ghost but never die to themselves they want to go on praising god but never have died to themselves and then they keep getting scrupled up in life they keep getting into this mess and the same going around around the same battles over and over again because they never died out to that old man brother branham actually he talked to sidney jackson he said he said when you receive the holy ghost he said it comes through he says it burns out the old man he said it goes from a place of dominion over your life he said it stands behind you at a place of influence brother that old man just don't go away it stands behind you trying to influence you to keep doing the same old things that you used to do and yet i got a holy ghost that's now inside of me that has dominion over that old man that can absolutely combat that old man that old nature that's trying to get me to do and go back to my old ways so we got to die to ourselves there has to be a process of death and that is what people do not want to do brother sisters they don't want to die that old man's got to die in order for you to live again now spiritually you're either going to die to your flesh or your soul is going to die but you got to die at some point brother if i died in my flesh now and my soul is resurrected into new life and eternal eternity becomes uh something that is now a part of me my i could never die but if i want to hold on to my old ways and my own life and my old tendencies then i can die now and i'm going to die in the flesh and i'm going to rot in the grave with no no hopes for eternal life so you're going to die at some point i'd rather die to myself now see the soul that sinneth that soul shall die you know when you take a this is from be not afraid 961 is one of my favorite quotes when you know when you know when you take a notion to meet jesus he will make you do some of the silliest things this ain't no catholic he'll make you do some of the silliest things he will just ruin all your prestige you think you won't squall and cry and boo hoo but you will if you want to see him brother anybody ever got desperate to see the lord you'll just do anything to see him blind bartimaeus he was able to scream and shout until he got god's attention there were many people willing to do a lot of things to get god's attention what are you willing to do this afternoon to get god's attention amen you will do anything to see him now he said you'll make you do some of the silliest things silly is having or showing a lack of common sense or judgment absurd and foolish it's used to convey that an activity or process has been engaged in to such a degree that someone is no longer capable of thinking or acting sensibly he'll make you act unsensibly in fact brother madam said that when the anointing comes and that revelation that stimulation he said it'll make a person act unseemingly it'll make them act different it'll make you do things you didn't think you would do it'll take the quietest person the next you know they're the loudest person in the church why they caught fire on the inside change that old nature those old tendencies to be quiet and shy brother bradham actually said that when they came out of the upper room he said when they went in they was afraid it's what he said he said when they went in they were they were embarrassed they were ashamed they were afraid they were fearful for their lives jesus never did tell him to go into an upper room jesus said go wait in the city of jerusalem but they got scared went up into an upper room shut the doors closed the shutters and everything else and while they was in there brother adam said they were fussing still fighting they were trying to get in one accord he said all of a sudden they got in one accord and the holy ghost came into those people he said all of a sudden they went from being shy and shameful and fearful they went to being bold brother adam said the courage of the lion of the tribe of judah came into the people and out into the streets they went stumbling and acting like they was drunk people speaking in tongues that's right that's right see palmer worm locust cankerworm caterpillar 59 there is no place in the bible i want you to notice this there is no place in the bible where that they ever receive the holy ghost without having emotions speaking with tongues and shoutings and praises of god and prophecies and manifestations no not there's not one place in the bible where they ever just shook hands or felt the nice feeling go down their spine or they were in the church for 30 years so somehow that means they got it there's no place where they ever receive the holy ghost without having emotions speaking with tongues and shoutings and praises of god and prophecies and manifestations a deceived church by the world 59 and a man or woman can never have new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead die out at the altar and scream get all messed up to a place that the starch gets out of your collar and you are born again by the spirit of god i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with its head cut off you are bringing forth new life brother brad i'm saying i don't care what you do i don't care if you flop roll flip over i don't care what you do but if you're bringing forth new life i don't care what i have to do to get it as long as i can get it but you have to go through a process of death the new bird don't matter how messy it looks brother i remember years ago we was having a camp meeting and the way it just the whole altar was just i mean there was more it was so packed it was just the whole thing was filled almost halfway down the church with young people and i looked down and there was a sister that had been crying and snotting the way that brother branham describes here and when she looked up her hair was matted to her face she had tears coming down she had snot coming this way and she just didn't care because god was dealing with her brother when god begins to deal with you you lose sight of everything else around you you forget where you are you forget who you are and you find yourself in christ brother sister this is why people never find their purpose this is why people are unhappy in life is because they never find out who they are in christ no matter how messy it looks how much you have to bawl and squall and carry on at the altar or whatever you have to do how many this afternoon would say i'm willing to do whatever i have to do to get christ on the inside of this earthen vessel brahmana says all the unnecessary things that you think you wouldn't do it'll make you do it all the things you think are unnecessary all the things that people leave church over well if i have to do that i just ain't gonna do it that way so i'll go somewhere else or do something else all the unnecessary things that you think you wouldn't do it'll make you do it the word unnecessary means not needed it's not needed this is the way that the people teach the new birth today brother sister it's not even needed brother it's a necessity god didn't ask our opinion over it either it's not needed that's what unnecessary means not needed it's anonymous with optional it's optional unwanted more than is needed it's excess all those people at the altar screaming and crying bawling boohoo and snotting down their it's unnecessary it's unneeded it's excess it's more than what we need to be doing all that shouting and carrying on all that praising and worshiping god it's more it's more than what's needed since when did god leave it up to you to decide what's needed see it's unnecessary it's not required it's uncalled for see brotherhood says you you have pride and don't want to wash the lipstick off your face some tears might do that for you that's right but it'll make a messy look out of you but you'll come up from there a different person born of the spirit of god a new creature in christ brother i'll tell you that 120 in that upper room it wasn't an upper room anymore it became a birthing room that room became a birthing room brother i tell you today this building it can't even look the same after a while if you ever really get in the spirit and begin to let god get a hold of you this room will turn from just a regular old church room it'll turn into a birthing room for you he wants you god wants you can you imagine we have a god that made heavens earth the sea the land everything that there is on earth amen he's so powerful he's omnipresent omniscient he's all these things and god cares about you he wants you it's an individual and you must be born again and receive the baptism of the holy spirit or you're gone see you're just playing church without receiving the baptism of the holy ghost and being born again you're just playing church that's all you're doing you could play an instrument you can sing specials you can even preach you can do this or that but brother if you've never been born again all you're doing is playing church [Applause] well this ain't an hour to play church have you seen what's going on in the government have you seen what's going on in the world have you seen what's going on in the churches brother this ain't a time to play church this isn't a time to do any of that this is a time to get down to business with god this is a time to check up and see where we're at you're playing church you're just impersonating until you actually have an experience of being born again watch uncertain sound 61 and from the altar of abel came the cry of a lamb everyone remember cain brought it all made an altar abel made an altar they both made an altar but one did something by revelation the other one just did something that was by an old cardinal way of intellectual thinking from the altar of abel came the cry of a lamb there was death to pay the penalty blood was being shed and today when god just like it was in that day when he told cain cain was discouraged he said here's the best i can do brother the best you can do is filthy rags before the lord here's the best i can do you can take it or leave it mark can you imagine somebody's attitude like that with the lord here's the best i can do take it or leave it god do do anything you want to about it but that's all i can do about it that's what people are today brother they're so indifferent about the things of god uh if i feel like worship i will if i don't it's okay if i feel like praying i will if not it's okay if i get into the preaching it's all right but if not it's fine it's okay everything's fine everything's great everything's wonderful got a few dollars in my pocket don't have nothing too crazy going on in my life some people have to hit rock bottom before they finally get down to business with god sad but that's the truth see that was cain's attitude indifferent that's the way the modern christian worships today i go to church i help the preachers i pay my tithing if they got any social party i put my part in it and if they need a missionary offering i help in it that's good but that's not what god requires he's got to hear the sound of death he's got to hear the sound of death bless god what god wants today is you to die die to the things of the world and yourself hear a scream lord take me as i am that's what people don't want to do they don't want to come out of themselves they don't want to go beyond this flesh brother of adam said get out of these three dimensions and get up into the next one where god is this is why we don't get healed this is why we don't get the holy ghost this is why we don't get delivered from our sin this is why we don't break chains during service because we don't get out of these dimensions we're trying to worship god in the flesh we're trying to worship god in our intellectuals you can't worship god that way you got to get out of this place you got to get out of yourself and you got to enter into a realm beyond here that's how you get something from god then let a scream come out lord take me as i am that's what god wants he wants that sound of death that death rattle i hear the sound of dry bones rattling that death rattle of old man adam that's dying you ever seen a calf get branded i have brother that thing will kick and squirm and spit and go all cra but when it's done he knows who is pappy and his ma'am he is he knows who he belongs to well this is why we get these young people they're born into a church like this or somewhere else where there's a good gospel preacher that's preaching solid on the word of god the spirit of god present every service turn 18 leave and act like they never heard a word of it they never got this they never went through a process of death he wants to hear that old man die he wants to hear the sound of death that he might come in and take his place and rule you and be your lord you know that it's been reported that there's been people that have died and when they come back they have abilities that they didn't have before there's people that have died and have given testimony they didn't even know how to play a piano when they died came back to life and was able to play a piano brother you'd be shocked at dying to yourself what god will raise you up into you'll be shocked after you're done dying to yourself and the holy ghost fills your life and brings you up in newness of life you'll be shocked what god could do to you hallelujah you might have an ability you never had before you might start worshiping god like you never have before you might start witnessing on the street like you never have before amen you might be able to live it in your school when you go to school you might be able to live it at your job when you couldn't do it before you couldn't bring yourself to do it before but now that i've died and i resurrected in christ i can do things i wasn't able to do before i've been able to conquer myself i can conquer myself brother sister that's what god wants people don't bother i've said people don't want to get the birthright because they think it's a little unpopular they don't want to get down at the altar and cry a little bit go without a few meals something other are you willing to go without a few meals to get god does it mean that much to you i'll skip lunch dinner i'll skip as many meals as i got to until i get god that's the attitude brother sister that's the way to come to god but i said i've seen him at billy graham's chewing bubble gum walking up to line go back sit down until you're ready to be dead they think it's a little unpopular they don't want to get down at the altar and cry a little bit miss a few meals something another they don't want to do it a lot of the way a lot of you you know your makeup on they think they cry they might wash it off have to put it on again why and i don't mean to say that sacrament i hope it don't sound that way but that's the truth they just don't want it they don't want the new birth because the new birth is kind of messy it's like any other birth any birth is a mess i don't care where it's at if it's in a pig pan or in a barn or if it's in a pink decorative hospital room it's a mess messy means out of order brother battle said i hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved i hope we can get out of order long enough to get the holy ghost i hope we can get out of order long enough to make a rapture [Applause] out of order and so it is the new birth a mess amen it'll make you do things you didn't think you'd do stand on a corner be the tambourine or sing glory to be to god hallelujah praise god glory to god why you'll act like a maniac you know what the word maniac means it means a person expressing symptoms of wild behavior brahma said that's the way they acted on the day of pentecost like a bunch of maniacs brother if satan can make you act like a maniac for his amusement that's all he does you go off start doing your own thing and satan just sits back just laughs at you boy he's just laughing brother and said that's exactly what he was doing when they saw samson that great man of god with his eyes out being led by a lad to make sport and there they are laughing at god's servant oh brother i tell you what you get the holy ghost satan ain't laughing no more satan can't laugh anymore because he'll be crying you'll act like a maniac how many can honestly say in your heart you know you hadn't got this what i'm preaching on this this afternoon and you can honestly say in your heart lord even if it makes me act like a maniac this afternoon i want the holy ghost even if i do something that's way out of my element lord if it's in your element i'll do anything lord i'll just do anything to see you i'll do anything to have you oh brother sister when we get like that i think god will do something for us i think that's when god steps in and says all right he's ready he's ready to die it takes a mess for life to come out unless anything dies in roth's life can't come from it unless a man dies and rots in his own thoughts christ can't get into his heart oh brother pentecost is our pattern brother sister but i said that's what's the matter with the church today they got too starchy too much pride too much too much pride that's a reason for the divisions in the churches that's the reason that pastor don't want to talk to this other pastor that's the reason that this one won't fellowship with this one so reason for most of the problems in the church is people have too much pride they got too much pride they ain't willing to do what god said in his word to do because then they would have to humble themselves under the hand of a mighty god and they ain't going to do that because they're almighty so and so and they're very important and what they say is very important what they think is very important what they don't realize is what they think say and do is not even important what are we six foot of dust but i want my experience to match the bible if that's how they acted on the day of pentecost brother sister that's how i want to act and in my experience i didn't act like that i need to go back and have another experience till i act that way and not only act that way but come up and be a different person because brother if we can do all that and go outside and talk against our brother hello go outside and messing around with the girls go outside and talk the same language we always did and brother we didn't get that experience we might have shouted and jumped with the rest of them we didn't get that brother sister you stay there until you're dead till you're dead to self and god reigns in the holy spirit into your life not just not just for that service but brother till he fills you with the holy ghost brom said samson he said that last great effort he said look he said the spirit of god filled every fiber of his name anybody ever felt that i have let me just say that service lasted about six and a half hours that day watch this in the message the invisible union of the bride of jesus christ 1965 brother branham said the modern church don't want none of those screaming shouting blabbering tongue speaking acts 2 38 miserable children that jesus thinks they are you don't want him but he said that's the only kind that the word can produce and god's bound to his own word so guess what he can't vary from that he can't there's not a different solution for a new birth it's the only kind the word can produce what is it it's a death it's a death before there can be a resurrection there has to be a death we want to resurrect before we've even died you've got to die before a resurrection and a new life can come it's a birth brother branham told of the young girl you remember that brother brown when he was younger he wanted there was this young girl that he liked and she wanted to go to dances said he wouldn't go to dances want to go to the movie show and go to movie show he said i want to go here and there and you know i don't want to what do you do for fun how do you get any joy where do you get joy from where does your joy come from well i like to fish i like to hunt that didn't interest her brother adam said that he was having some meetings a couple days later that girl showed up at that meeting said and all of a sudden there was thousands that came to the altar screaming and crying and praising the lord and she was up there with him crying she said billy i want this and brother bottom said i took her by the hand i said i said sister you want to know what joy i have said this is the joy that i have here brother i said i get more joy in the presence of god that you could get in 50 years in this life i get more joy in five minutes in the presence of the lord brother adam said if we could get so together this church bond our faith and our worship together he said in five minutes there wouldn't be one crippled person in our midst there would be one person in the holy oak but one would receive it there want to be one person needing deliverance that one day delivered how many wants to be delivered this morning how many wants a new birth this morning i say how many people are ready to die to yourself and be born again in christ glory to god you've got to have an experience like jacob did amen jacob grabbed a hold of that angel he said i'm not going to let you go until you bless me that's the attitude this morning brother sister you want to die you want a birth you're going to have to grab a hold of god this morning and say i'm not going to let you go until you bless me there's power in holding on i said there's power in holding on not just praying for a little bit until satan tells you you're done not just praying for a little bit till you get a tear roll down your face not just praying for a little bit i say you pray and hold on until you know that you're thoroughly convinced that you're thoroughly convinced that you've had a revelation that god has birthed you you've got to have that experience brother you've got to have an experience like miriam had when you see that your enemy is dead that's the experience you've got to have that's the experience you've got to have to go not let brother isaiah be the one playing the tambourine you'll go grab the tambourine from brother isaiah and say let me play that thing i just saw my enemies dead brother there was a death to self that's exactly what that type is brother sister the same thing that had stood over her and spit in her face and told her she was unworthy and she was this and that the same enemy that grabbed that whip and whipped her into stripes and blood pour it out and told her she was this and that that same enemy was drowning in a sea brother you can drown your enemy in a sea of blood this morning it's the same blood that poured out of emmanuel's veins on calvary's hill but i'm so glad somebody went to war for me [Music] somebody went to war for me when i couldn't go to war for myself when i couldn't fight for myself god sent down somebody to go to war for me his name was jesus he went to war for me so that i could be free so that i could be whole so i could tell everyone i know he thought i was worth saving he thought i was worth keeping when everybody else could only see the worst in me he saw the best in me he said brother tim you're quoting gospel songs i sure am they got a lot of truth in them i like it better a lot of these more modern songs let me tell you i like some of those old gospel songs i like them old slave songs too brother sister people that went through something people that had to go through things that birthed songs out of travail burst songs out of hardship you know that some of the best songs ever written came out of hardship came out of trial came out of testing the man that wrote it as well with my soul both his daughter and his wife passed away and he still sung a song called it is well with my soul why because he knew who his god was he had an experience with the living god i want to have a merriam experience i want to see my enemies dead i don't want to walk out with my enemies still holding on to me you notice that miriam did not dance when the sea opened it was tremendous it was a great miraculous feat that god had put but you know what miriam never did start dancing it wasn't until she saw that her enemies were dead and never going to bother her again that marion started dancing anybody here ever dance in the spirit you will you ever see your enemies dead you'll have a dance that'll last till the raptor brother sister i can't help praising god it just comes naturally to those that have been born again rum says you say i'm too young he says i'll tell you what the devil don't think so devil don't think they're too young he works overtime to distract us from the things of god especially our young people friends influences right cell phones social media video games movies world entertainments we go on and on satan tries to distract you from your experience with god whether if we ever die to ourselves brahm said those things will be better than midnight to us well i don't want to lose some of the the pleasures i get in this life brother you ain't ready to die yet i belong to church but you should be born again well if i get that kind of experience i won't be able to do this or do that or can't go to this and do that well you see the devil will tell you that you're going to lose some good time you're going to lose some privileges but he's lying to you especially young people oh my you don't have to drink you don't have to smoke you don't have to run around in this place of amusement why the holy spirit is a million times better than all the devil could ever offer you anybody ever found that to be true i know i have i've always said you want to come to a dance come to church you want to go to a party come to church you want a drink come to church whether there's a wine that's full flowing full and free you don't even have to pay for it you don't got to worry about it running out god's got a free-flowing tap going on and it just keeps on giving and giving and the more you take in the more don't be like that little fish in the ocean thinks he's going to drink up the whole ocean well you just keep drinking and drinking and drinking i don't have it with me brother brown said i've been drunk for a long time there's something about being born again brother sister creates a well inside of you just keeps on bubbling keeps on flowing i remember the hour i got born again remember the hour that god began to fill me with the holy ghost anybody ever got to rock bottom i have let me tell you the way of the transgressor is hard brother sister i grew up in church my dad pastors the church a saying i song-led preached once in a while but somehow i had failed throughout all my years to truly let the holy ghost come in and abide not just to come in brother sister but to let him abide to let him become lord of your life everybody with me amen a lot of people want him to be the savior they don't want him to be their lord that means turning over rulership to jesus christ people don't want to do that brother i got to a place i was sat down from singing i was sitting in the pew i went from being one of the liveliest ones to being one of the deadest ones in the church i fell into a depression i came into a real dark spot and i came to a place in my life it was either i'm gonna just head right out forget everything i've ever been told learned or anything i've ever felt about god or you're going to go all the way with god you come to a crossroads in your life brother sister where you can't play church anymore you're going to have to make a decision it was a wednesday night i was sitting down next to mama be shocked what the prayers of your mama can do i was sitting there message was over i hadn't felt the holy spirit in months i haven't thought the lord speak to me in months all of a sudden the lord spoke to me right there that wednesday night and i knew i knew that i was going to leave that service different i walked up to the altar and i said dad i want the holy ghost i raised up my hands about five seconds into that prayer brother sister the holy spirit i felt it was like a but it felt like someone had a blow torch right over my head but it came into my body i felt it come it burst through my chest went all the way down into my feet i fell backwards onto the floor brother i laid there for about five minutes babbling something i don't know what i was doing when i got out of that church brother sister i wasn't perfect i wasn't the greatest human being that ever lived on this planet but i knew one thing i was going to be different i know i wasn't walking out of there the same person that i walked in there i'm here to tell you don't let the devil tell you you're not worthy don't let him tell you that you crossed a line with god don't let him tell you that you don't have the strength to make it because guess what i'm not counting on my strength anyhow i'm counting on the grace of almighty god that called me well that's how my fire got lit i've had a fire ever since have i had battles and trials yeah i've had battles and trials have i ever got sad again yeah i got sad again but there's something that holds on the inside [Applause] stand with me would you i'm talking about a process of death brother sister have you started that process are you willing to go through that process brother adam said oh there's people in eternity tonight out in house screaming if we could walk and pull open the gate like this and let you look down in there i'd never have to make much of an altar call they'd be screaming and climbing over one another for the opportunity you imagine someone that's in hell that knew they did wrong knew they never repented knew that they didn't get born again knew these things that we're trying to tell you now but i'm saying if hell could swing open its doors right now they would come crawling over one another i wouldn't even have to make an altar call they would just come running over sprinting crawling over one another trying to get to the service you won't go to what an opportunity we have this afternoon but they have passed beyond the veil beyond mercy now it's too far they can't never be redeemed they're going they're gone forever they will never never be redeemed they had the same opportunity that you have those people in hell that if the doors would open they would be crawling over one another they had the same opportunity that you have right now this afternoon now we could pretend that this is just a cute little service for the young people and we could walk out and oh that was so nice go do something fun i don't know or we could recognize the presence of god that is here with us this afternoon we could shake off all the devils that have been attacking us we can shake off all the formalism all the pride all the indifference we can come before the lord see i don't see him rather i see him all around this building what is he doing knocking knocking he's not pounding he's not trying to kick down your door he's knocking softly [Music] you say brother tim i don't you don't understand what i'm going through yes ma'am yes sir i sure do i sure do know what you're going through i went through the same thing i went through that process of death it's not fun fun comes later it's grueling it's hard brother sister being a christian is the hardest thing you'll ever do that ain't for the wake of heart it's not for the faint of heart it's not for people that couldn't hack all the crazy world out there no it's it's the hardest thing you'll ever do is be a christian because this is satan's eating everything that is portrayed around you everything that is displayed around you is of the devil the majority of it is all from the devil it's all the devil's work in other words everything outside of the church the family the word of god your prayer life is things that are trying to destroy you they're totally anti-god but you can receive a spirit not just any spirit the spirit of jesus christ can come into you this afternoon to combat that thing out there you might have walked and defeated brother you died of yourself this afternoon get the holy ghost you'll walk out with so much victory you don't know what to do with yourself you'll be ready to be a witness you'll be ready to tackle every devil that comes your way he's here this afternoon brother sister i felt him since i walked in don't waste your opportunity like those in hell wasted they had the same opportunity god isn't just if he didn't give everyone an opportunity he's giving us all an opportunity this afternoon you don't have to leave the same anybody ready to be different [Music] you wouldn't want to take their place tonight would you why not take the place at the right hand of christ to sit with him in heavenly places and with the saints and with the redeemed of the age to live in the blessed forever remember when jesus came walking on the sea towards the disciples and they thought it was a spirit so they got afraid then he said some very precious words brother sister he said fear not it is i be not afraid don't be afraid of god tonight this afternoon don't be afraid of god that presence you feel that spirit that's circling around you that's the presence of almighty god he thought enough of you to come down and make himself personally known to each one of you this afternoon but i could point out the people that god's trying to get to this afternoon are you afraid of god i want to ask you a question are you afraid of god is that why you've held off on so many of these things you're afraid of god it's all right to be afraid of what you can't see but brother when you've ever had that experience you'll see god everywhere you look most importantly you'll see god in you [Music] oh brother ram said people are scared to death of the new birth they're scared of becoming fully sold out to christ are you scared to be sold out are you scared to turn over all your heart to the lord don't be scared this afternoon the greatest choice you'll ever make is to allow jesus christ to be the king of your life greatest choice we'd be a fool to reject that we would absolutely be foolish to reject the holy spirit that's in this building tonight [Music] everyone feel that i want i'm going to stop talking for just a second i want you just by your head i want you to just feel that spirit that's fluttering around us right now [Music] [Music] you feel that [Music] i remember brother giving a testimony he said i they called for the altar call he said i was walking up he said all of a sudden i felt like i stepped into a deep freeze he said and brother branham looked right at me and said brother don't be afraid of that that's just the presence of the lord [Music] don't be afraid [Music] young brother in the back there god's been dealing with you this whole time i want you to let them in [Music] that's it there's one do i have another one that's ready to answer the call tonight this evening this afternoon altar is open you can receive it right where you are you don't have to come to an altar what you do have to do is surrender your life to the lord say here i am lord take me take all of me i'm opening up every door every window every secret closet all the things i never told my parents because i'm just too embarrassed and ashamed about it give it all to you lord [Music] oh hallelujah [Music] blessed be the name [Music] like i said the altar is open this afternoon i'm gonna pray if you want the holy ghost to pour down into you this afternoon and you're ready to die to your enemy ready to die to yourself i want you just to lift up your hands just say lord take me lord fill me lord give me victory give me strength give me joy give me peace take away this anxiety this depression this enemy of fear oh hallelujah [Music] oh dear gracious heavenly father lord lord as we come into your

well i trust everybody it's been blessed i have been we thank god for god using our in such a special way you know even when you're praising god you can always pray if you don't if you don't have it you can pray to get it but when the anointing is here it's always here to destroy the yokes of the enemy and whenever you see the waters troubled like you saw today don't be afraid of it that's life you know satan will try to make you afraid you know even when someone jumps and knocks another you know the enemy might say see god don't love you god loves you it's always the enemy that's trying to destroy you or trying to stop you from going forward understand you have to press through a lot of things but that's okay that's all right when jesus shows up things do happen you know i appreciate the lord jesus christ for it's goodness and we thank god for all of you like i said i was gonna i was gonna speak on and i hate to destroy the anointing because everything is so good but uh we as young people need to come up with some ideas on how to not only do things that will bring us closer to the lord but things that we can do as a group one of the things that we and i'm going to let our wherever he is oh there he is amen i knew you were show up but not that short good come i'm gonna let you talk to him about that on things that we've been talking about doing and last year some of you all may not have been uh aware but some of the young people and myself went down to the park and we did some singing and some preaching um you know just a witness you know it can't hurt but it surely can help you it'll take away your shame and your embarrassment or whatever the case may be because it puts you out there and then now people know you're a christian and these things are not a mandate it's not a mandatory thing but hopefully we'll get a chance to do some of those things and who knows we might be able to catch some fish last year when we did go out some people were interested but where i failed i sat down and started talking to them and when i did that i lost the other crowd of people who were in their cars listening to the message so we learned through our uh uh experiences you go to fishing you catch some and because like we did last year we went fishing and we made so much noise the fish knew all about us so we didn't catch anything so by god's grace we hope to be fishermen of men don't be afraid of the holy ghost i used to be afraid of the holy ghost when i saw my mama jerking and carrying on and i'm thinking it looked like it hurt but sometimes what it is the joy of the lord is so wonderful that your body doesn't know how to respond to it and sometimes it act like uh like my brother you jump and just jump and you know that's one way but that's not the only way sometimes we cry sometimes we scream sometimes we just do things that like he said becomes a mess but i can tell you this so that you'll know there is no feeling ever you'll ever feel on this earth that will supersede what the holy spirit gives you you can try everything any kind of drugs any kind of immoral things you want to but i'ma tell you when the holy ghost strikes you it takes you to another level it puts you in a different place you know and as our brother timothy say get away from this third dimension let's take it higher i like when he i like that word dimension see because it helps me out because i understand that this thing here it takes god to take away your sadness it take away your your pain you know all of those things but we're gonna let our brother come i'm a preacher so he's still that anointing is still here so i'd be careful amen so we'll let a
