just want to get right into the word of the lord if brother frank bring me my water brother i'm sorry god is so good to us saint john 14 20. thank you sir we're going to just work with that one scripture for the moment everybody everybody's there trust matthew mark luke and john john 14 and 20. i love the book of john all of the gospels are great but the book of john to me is it's just amazing because john starts at a place where none of the others do start john starts from the beginning or in the beginning or before the beginning however you want to place it but i just love john and john revelation of god was as far as i'm concerned perfect and understanding and he understood what god was going to do in this day i believe god gave him a great understanding saint john 14 20. amen can you imagine how he must have felt when he was able to be in a position nobody else could be in i got it correctly he laid in the bosom of jesus christ and tonight that's where i want to lay in his bosom saint john 14 20 at that day ye shall know that i am in the father and ye and me and i in you before i began to pray there was a sister is a sister by the name of kiki she's from ohio lima uh she doesn't know this message per se but she consider herself as a christian anyway she's suffering from cancer and they've tried the um different methods and they all failed and now they are trying the chemo she's quite weak i suggested that they play the tape victory day for her uh faith is a victory i'm sorry and um desperation so they're going to allow her or try to get her to listen to those tape and pray that god will quicken her with the faith that she needs to overcome with so let's pray that god will bless the message tonight father god we come before you and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us words cannot express our gratitude father we just pray right now that you bless the word open our understanding we know father god is not in the loudness or the pronunciations of words or the drama that could be added to it that's nothing to do with you your word is simple plain and true and we pray that this word would quicken our souls we're depending on you lord to give us understanding and enlightenment and the things that we need to know and the things that we need to know to walk in bless us tonight as we glorify your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i love god because he's such a god of variety you know he he's the kind of god that could love you in spite of all of your faults that's the kind of love i want to express tonight message would be working with the thought hungering to see more of him of course in my little attachment i said in the inner man because we are predestinated to come to a completion and i believe that i believe that we're the generation that is going to see the perfect man make us become the perfect man we are those who are of abraham's seed and the bible tells us that abraham staggered not and oftentimes we read that we really don't see what really being said but i don't know whether you've ever walked and something just caused you to trip and you're staggered momentarily but the bible says that there was nothing that tripped abraham or caused him to stagger no matter what came his way abraham believed god remember i said in the messages before and prior this message mean you no good if you really don't believe it and this belief is a action word hearing acting believing you know it's something that goes into effect once it's quickened to you according to romans 4 20-25 the bible says he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god that means when you don't even see evidence of your blessing you're able to glorify god this is the part that i really love because it used the word fully and being fully persuaded that means there was no room for nothing else his faith had captured the entire environment what he had promised he was able to perform remember the bible says to those who come to god must first believe that he is god you know what i mean now and we say is god is more than just something to worship but we're talking about god who created all things these little these little finite minds can't comprehend it but the only thing we can do is have faith and believe it that means he's omnipotent all power omniscient knows all things is that right omnipresent because he's everywhere by his full knowledge and therefore he well it was imputed to him for righteousness you understand that the scripture uh jesus was asked you know what must we do basically to inherit eternal life and he said believe on him whom i have sent that's powerful because if you think about it you're thinking about that jesus is basically saying believe on me but it wasn't just that it mean to believe on whom the man whom i've sent that he's carrying the word of god and you've got to believe on him and and he he can i say it like this he duped the devil in this last day when he brought william branham on the scene and a lot of us don't even realize how important uh knowing who he is and who he was what it's going to mean for you down the road and perhaps the days are short and more shorter shorter than you think they are now in other words god would not impute sin to abraham instead of imputing sin i'm happy he imputed righteousness can you understand that can you understand he imputed righteousness and if you if you watch abraham's life he made a lot of mistakes but god imputed righteousness he deceived the king of egypt would have caused his death and in all of that he was so blessed when he left egypt he had more substance leaving egypt than he had going into think about it in this day amen that we're hungering for god is such a blessing i don't know about you but i want everything that the message is promised everything of god everything of god i don't have to be a great man i don't have to be some well-known person i just want to have him right in that way that the bible says i'm supposed to have now it was not written for his sake all alone that he it was it was imputed to him in other words this was not given just for abraham but remember brother talks about abraham's seed but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who has delivered who who was delivered for our offenses y'all understand me in the scripture the bible says he was delivered for our offenses in other words he paid your debt he paid your debt now there shouldn't be a sad christian anywhere in the world if they understand this listen i'm kind of glad you're quiet tonight because i'm actually in a shout mood so you're stabilizing me right now amen who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for what our justification okay you know it's like okay i'm guilty i'm guilty on every charge every charge and here is a man who takes my place that's the scripture says he became our righteousness we became his righteousness he became our sin yonders oh my you see but like i said you got to believe this every man in this world if you're not believing the truth you're believing a lie right because remember the whole bible starts off with the truth and then satan brings in a lie and his whole civilization has been based on lies but for the man who believes the truth he comes to understand this is not the creature that god intended me to be something's on the inside of him that cries out for more you know you you see all of the crazy things they put out there and and everybody want to be a superstar and everybody want to have these uh super powers but nobody wants the super god who can produce the super power who could make you a superman you see they don't want that they want the lies of the enemy and therefore they have been given over to a strong delusion in the book of psalms 61 38 let me hurry up for that has been my shelter for me and a strong tower from the end of me i will abide in that tabernacle forever i will trust the comfort of that covet of thy wings oh i didn't even know what that was until the the seals were open and the angels with the swept back wings now what am i doing i'm trusting in that revelation i can rest in that amen because the lamb has opened the book he's loosed the seals and he's claimed his subjects and i'm so glad to be one of them ah for thou god has heard my vows thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name thou will prolong the king's life and his gears as many generations he shall abide before god forever oh prepare mercy and truth which may preserve me huh mercy and truth will preserve me because as long as i know mercy and i know truth i know there's grace hallelujah so will i sing praise unto thy name forever that i may daily perform my vows you understand me you say well what vows what vows we're talking about a marriage here we're not talking about just any kind of violence we're talking about the bride and the bride bridegroom i'll be faithful as faithful as i possibly can be right now let me move on i've been enjoying myself blessed is the man who thou chooses and causes to approach that's psalm 65 and 4 unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple you say oh i came to the lord yes if you did it's because god caused it god was moving in your life even when you didn't even realize he was moving at the end of the day it's going to always be god the lord jesus he says i am the alpha the omega the beginning and the end paul says he's the author of salvation that means he wrote the book you understand me so therefore you are in his book you are his uh hockey i said he wrote you in there he caused you he calls you we saw i thirst for god he causes you to thirst oh i'm desperate for god he causes you to be desperate how many of us wish we were desperate at times you can't do it you can get on your knees and and everything else and try your best but when god puts a desperation on you it's the saddest thing about that brother brethren said god really has he's got to do that because men are so slawful in their ways god has to put circumstances and conditions in our play in our in our pathway to bring us to a desperation i don't care how he does it i'm just so glad he's doing it cause me to be desperate right because you got to understand there is a quench there's a thirst quencher and that's who jesus is when you thirst for righteousness the bible said you shall be filled he's a thirst quencher if you want a deeper revelation he's a thirst quencher if you want to understand the seven seals he's a thirst quencher hallelujah whatever you desire of god he he knows how can i say it break the bread right because remember jesus christ was spiritually breaking the bread to the disciples on the way to to emmaus they didn't even know it he was breaking the bread and he started from the prophets and he brought it all the way up and then when he finally broke the natural bread the eyes were open can't nobody do me like jesus can't nobody give me that revelation nobody can quicken me it's just you know how can you say it there's something about this message as that song says that keeps holding me oh we've got to become more sensitive to the holy spirit that's our problem we're not as sensitive as we should be we're too calm minded right amen and uh we we need to ask god lord make me more sensitive to you that if i'm walking down the street and you pass by me make me know that's you if somebody is talking to me and then they don't even appear to be a a christian but you speak through them lips let me know it's you y'all do you believe god can do that absolutely if god can speak to balaam through a donkey he can you is that right it was one of the romans was it caesar a herot herod that literally said that one man was going to die to save them all uh and and and i think it was one of those backslidden priests but anyway it was sad and god used him to prophesy when he wasn't even a prophet what we understand you say well what is pressing what is pressing what is what is being sensitive sensitive to the very fact that you need more god so many people don't even know that um they think they're okay the pharisees and sadducees thought they were all right did y'all know that until john came the denominational system thought they were all right until the spirit of john came and he shook their world they hated him because he he literally exposed their nakedness and even though they thought they were clothed they were naked because the word of god said they would be in this day so they had to come to the knowledge that they were naked because the bible said they didn't know they were naked but when the word began to shine on them instead of clothing themselves they had preferred and had rather be naked than clothed but this message is a clothing it is the righteousness of god it is god amen clothing you with his his character hallelujah you see we didn't know and i'm still i'm still i'm reaching a higher plane now i'm still working with that that's in this what i'm working with now is in the theme of that because i want you to understand what i'm talking about is not going to just drop in your lap you've got to press your way into it and as brother branham said you got to climb up into god i like that it doesn't come easy you got to somehow separate you got to put yourself in a position where you and god and god alone and be honest you know this is how i've overcome so many things have in my life because what can you hide from god you can't hide anything from me and i'm telling you i've had to come first confess unto god some wicked stuff hello whoo don't you say that brother brooks i've had to you know things that i thought felt and at times desired and it was hard for me to say that to god even though i knew he knew you understand me but i understood the only way that i could ever be free was to make god know that these things that abide or or or attract me is those things i do not desire to have lord this is a fleshly man's desire this is the fleshly man's wants this is the fleshly man amen lusting this is the fleshly man amen desiring those things but i need more spirit i need more god i need more of you that's the only way i can overcome i can't overcome on myself no man can do it i'm gonna tell you you can you can you can be on a mountaintop you know in a cave acting like a monk and your sins will still be there why because you have an imagination and as long as your imagination is alive sin is alive what are you saying the bible says that man followed after the imagination of his heart and he became more wicked because your imagination will event invent excuse me we'll invent stuff a pleasure am i talking right may i have perhaps things you've never even dreamed about doing your imagination can bring it to a place of appeal appealing something that will appeal to you if it wasn't for the holy ghost the holy ghost is our bomber the holy ghost is the god that really stops it yes sir the holy ghost and says ah that's wrong [Laughter] i love it when we talk about pressing into and i'm going to tell you something right now you know just here's what god has done for me and in all the prayers that i did while i was in in uh uh arizona all of that was good but you know i learned one thing you can't quit not for a moment satan is always there right to fight you to bring everything down that you've established to take away all that you have you understand me and so it's always oppressing you understand me this kingdom is a kingdom of pressing it's not easy the bible said few be that find it only a few because so many are not willing to fight for it you got to fight and the thing about it i told a brother yesterday i must say i told him i said brother let me tell you something once a man surrender his will to god he has become totally victorious our greatest battle with surrender is our will we don't want to die we want to be in control y'all didn't know that man likes to be in control it's what satan placed in him he don't want god to control him but let me let me tell you something until you let god control you he can't transform this goat right he is trying to change you from a goat to a sheep because a sheep is one of the only animals i know that surrenders its will i mean even unto death i saw with my own eyes a sheep being slaughtered and he never fought back with my own eyes i was just amazed now the other sheep that was with him was afraid but they didn't scatter they huddled and they watched most of us when trials come like you're on your own man huh but when it comes to that it just it blew my mind i'm like oh my goodness and it just looked like the sheep was just when it came to the master cutting his throat and everything he was just faithful he wouldn't he wasn't acting like a goat kicking and carrying on anyway i thought about the lord i thought about the holy spirit when the holy spirit is one you know the bible says make your make your body a living sacrifice right don't kick against the holy spirit when god said don't do it don't do it don't fight back you know and that's what we do we fight back because we like i said we've got to move grace is good for us grace will always be with us grace is for us but we must move up higher to the fact that we are elected to be the bride of christ election will take you farther once you understand who you are you won't worry about grace because your your mindset is to do the king's will your mindset is to do what he wants you to do because you understand i am the bride of christ he's my head like i was trying to tell somebody the other day i said the headstone has come down right it's here to cap the bride it's here to bring uh her under his headship remember the body is the body but jesus christ is the head and so he's now let's say if you can see god in you in the way that you want to rule and reign let god rule and reign in your life right this is what i see this is the hour of intimacy we must come to this intimacy bro sisters we must i can't i can't tell you how important that is brother brown i mean the message um i was listening to it today listening to you know desperation he said that's what happened to the pentecostals they were they had the baptism of the holy ghost but they didn't want to move on to adoption understand they had the baptism that was a real holy ghost but they didn't want to cross over he said that was the way it was esau esau had the birthright hello and he gave it up to jacob because jacob wanted it jacob was born a son jacob was born with a promise but jacob wanted to see the promised live that's the bride of jesus christ you've been born with a promise and you want to see the promise live let me tell you about this it's not going to be a whole lot of folks i'm sorry this is not a group effort it's not about us no it's about you you're the man you're the woman that has to defy satan's lies you've got to look at this thing and keep your eyes focused on the promise like abraham who staggered not no matter what satan put in his way y'all know what i'm trying to say how many times you faltered and satan say see you're just a hypocrite you don't have to raise your hand i raise mine it's true people i'm not here to look like a pope or some grand bishop i'm a man and both all of us are looking for the same thing more of him i'm not afraid to say who am i am and my faults what it is why you know if the bible says if you hide your sins you can't prosper huh there's no prospect satan will lie to you and make you feel like you're prospering they give you some blessings as oh you're getting along pretty good well esau prospered matter of fact he was rich by the time jacob got back but where is esau who was esau your prosperity does not determine who you are what about the rich young ruler who had all of this money and all these goods and here was paul lazarus who was the rich man you understand me so let's not let satan deceive us in this age of increase with good and have need of nothing and bible said those people were naked and didn't even know it hungering you understand what i'm saying if you're not hungry you need to ask god to give you the hunger coming from the message amen hearing recognizing and acting he said there's something in you hungering and moving like it was jacob see you're wrestling with the lord you walk different after that something is different than you you've changed see that's what i'm saying oh oh i spoke in tongues but have you changed i've shouted and i danced but have you changed i believe the message but have you changed it must bring a change the change must be there and it's not something that you can do on your own he brings to change but you wrestle with this message you said that's me i'm not going to give up on it until you bless me till i become the word of this hour i told you i feel like shouting i'm trying to hold on i don't know how y'all feeling but this is really good to me i don't care i could stand here and preach till what hairs i've got left fell out till my shoulders stooped down and i was 90 years old and you listen every day until god quickens that to you you're still in the same shape he's the quickener you know what he means bring it to life two days i've been studying and praying on this and i said lord should i say that to the to the church he said something says say it the hour's at hand say it i feel he's pulling me away pretty soon see no man can come to me said jesus except my father draws him first and oh i know you say you have god and abraham and to your father amen but i'll tell you this let me say it i know you say you got william branham as your father but i'll say to you that this you're right to your father but i tell you this he goes home and says your father is of the devil said jesus religious men priests and great men you are of the devil your father see notice the fruits of the spirit and that that's what people around this message think well because i'm nice and i'm nice to people that vindicates me but scientology can produce that mind over matter can produce that that's not what you want you want a life that's so given you don't even know you're doing things right oh jesus when when did we visit you in prison and when did we feed you and when did we clothe you see they were so in love with christ they were so enveloped in his love i mean they never paid attention to what they were doing they just did what he said they weren't mocking it down well there's another nugget for my treasures in heaven there's one for another piece of something no they didn't do that uh-uh so you say what do you mean listen let me go on now because what we must understand is what the devil is trying to keep you from and that is the resurrection this is the rapture age he's trying to keep you from being raptured y'all understand that this is what he's all about right because he knows even if you foolish virgin he can torment you for a little more another season but the raptured bride is a slap in his face wouldn't you like to just slap him amen y'all act like y'all so religious i'm sorry you know my thing is i don't i don't i don't uh uh uh uh uh uh i i can't say that about anybody else but the devil yes if god gave me uh a place to slap him i would there's an angel that's going to throw him in the lake of fire do you really think the angel's going to say oh lord i really don't want to do this there are going to be people on the shore somewhere and i'm one of them somewhere that's going to be dancing and shouting trouble's over this thing we will never can you imagine never having to deal with him again now let me tell you something something's wrong with a man if he doesn't want to go help go to heaven or at least escape this world right something's wrong you see it falling apart people are killing each other for no apparent reason it ain't just strangers families fathers mothers sisters brothers killing one another under the inspiration of the devil a friend of mine just was witnessing to a person there in in ohio and this young man i think in his 20s he's been witnessing to him and so he fell away and he came back and then that time he wanted to talk to him but the lord kept showing him vindicating to him that he shouldn't go to his brother's house and um you know as a natural thing started happening seeing spiders and things that were just not normal so he he gathered the information no i better not he told a man young man i'm not coming and the young man committed suicide and i told his brother i said he was waiting on you had you gone out when god told you not to you would have been a victim of his scene see god protects us like that he protects us and i told her brother i said don't feel bad brother you did everything you could do for that young man but look what his intent was he said well brother brooks what are you telling listen i've had the experience when this i was supposed to uh rendezvous and meet with this one person and the holy spirit said don't do it i was going to do it and i had no idea that this this man was waiting to jump me to beat me here in iowa and i found out later through a person who knew him and they told me what his intent was you say god don't protect it god will protect you concerning about true worship in the spirit and truth listen we must understand that this message is giving us a mindset this is why you need to listen to brother branham you need to listen to what god speaks through him in these various messages because it literally elevates you from being just a sinner but to a person who has been totally justified where there is no sin against you and so when you understand that you've been totally justified it puts you in a mindset you don't have to worry about your sins you don't have to worry about your failures because the blood of jesus christ has cleansed you from all unrighteousness hallelujah god has already taken care of that you don't worry about that you need to learn how to press into the message of the hour press into the mindset of god let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus stop thinking like men and failures and sinners and all of that god didn't answer the same question oh jesus help me you see because what the devil does he pulls us back into the legalistic mind that if i do this he'll be merciful to me god has already been merciful to you in that while you were yes a similar christ died for you not when you was good who can be good enough who can be good enough the bible says there was not one worthy to open the book can i just jump a little bit let me just do it not worthy to open the book all the loose the seals there are none none of us in here so what is it we needed his grace we needed his love don't you understand this is the age of love his love we love him because he first loved us hallelujah the true love of god amen like paul said being said abroad in our hearts it gets better all the time yeah it's moving you just feel those good feelings you know folks are caught up i'm feeling pretty good you just feel those good feelings amen that you ever heard somebody massaging your heart you ever had that you leave church and you feel like somebody just massaged your heart and oh you just feel so good there's no other way i can explain it hallelujah amen coming from the message amen it is the rising of the sun he goes on to say now you are already resurrected see that's what the devil don't want us to know he wants us to stay earthbound he just this in this third dimension when we're not supposed to be here we're supposed to be living in heavenly places thinking like they think we're the only beings that literally can see the future because we've been told the future the sun is just now on you listen he raised you the son s o n is now on you and now you're growing into a blossom like he was growing into it you understand me it just don't say no you grow you know how many y'all ever seen a blossom open not with your natural nature uh maybe somebody has filmed it and you see how delicate it just opens up like a a dancer you know and and but but listen it happens it's happening not tomorrow it's now happening you say what do you mean that's why you're here something is happening in you something drew you something's moving in you it doesn't matter how many times you failed amen it's what's moving in you right now this flesh is sin hallelujah but the guy inside the man inside the god that's inside he's perfect and because he's perfect he makes this thing perfect hallelujah he was raised to be resurrected completely in the last days huh you hear what he said he was raised to be made perfectly right to be resurrected completely in that last day now his whole body which is you and me and all others who truly believe it's got to happen what's going to stop it you think the stone of a roman stone can stop it you think roman soldiers can stop it you think political lies can stop it nothing can stop this resurrection the devil is upset this is why he's doing everything he can to distract you but what he doesn't understand if you're dead you're just dead you can't distract a dead man your potentials right you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come in obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what the church know the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead it is an easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus and it's easter with you and i and jesus we are all or jesus you and i we are all resurrected together i believe that do i understand it no i don't have to understand it i don't understand why the sun shines but i can guarantee you it shines and every day it's going to shine it's going to shine while you live and it's going to shine when you die and it goes on and say and we will rise at that last day even see this is what i'm talking about somehow this joy that i'm looking to see in the people is just not there god it's just something lacking in the belief you got it here but he wants it here right and you got to understand this joy can only come if you press into it you got to press into it yes it's the devil's desire to shift you as we yes it is the desire to the devil's desire to take your joy hallelujah but listen if you're under the blood how can the devil take your jaw you must meet him somewhere there must be a rendezvous point oh but if you stay under the blood the devil can't do you no harm we will rise at that last day even though this our spirit leaves our body even though our body rust may they go to dust may they be burnt up may they be in the bottom of the sea the bible says that angel poured out his upon the sea and everything that died come up there is nothing can hide us or separate us from that god that we love so well that raised us up together you know what i'm saying that's why paul said nothing what what who shall separate me from the love of god right it ain't you it ain't about you loving him it's about him loving you he has determined that right therefore my heart is glad and my glory amen rejoices my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption see can't go until he can't go not and this rapture can't go until the last one comes in i'm almost done with the segment of it i'm coming to something because we got to ask god to deliver us from this laziness this lazy spirit that hinders us in our prayer this lazy spirit that hinders us in our study this lazy spirit amen that hinders us from witnessing you know them it's the devil now the devil cannot take away from you who you are you are who you are but he surely can hinder you he can hinder you see brother adam said that's what got the church into trouble today is too many educated preachers without being born of the spirit you know what i mean don't you see this kind of preaching a lot of people don't like it because i'm not dramatizing this stuff you know i'm leaving hollywood out of it huh oh i can get you going now but that ain't it i've learned we have left out of this place where josh oh was that a powerful message but with no change need change we need the quickening of the holy spirit we need something that will be said that's going to come and change the inside out too many educated preachers without being born of the spirit men and women like to listen to the intellectual speeches instead of preaching the power and the resurrection of jesus christ now watch this now no matter how deep brother branham was he never left out the resurrection he never left out the fact you and i need the holy ghost he always brought you back to calvary in some way or another his message is always brought you to a place where you wanted more of god hallelujah have you ever gotten jealous of some of the things that's happening on the tapes i'm gonna be honest me i am lord what about me what about me i wasn't there and you said blessed is the man who have not seen yet believe i'm more blessed but i want that kind of a change change wasn't difficult and listen no man was doing it he couldn't do it brother man couldn't do any of that he told us that's not me it's him and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever then if he did it then he can do it now but what were those people doing that we then that we're not doing now and that is believing honestly believing because the angel of the lord had already told brother branham you get the people to believe that all things are possible somehow they're believing better than what we're believing you see because the truth of the matter is all you need to do is really have the faith of god and believe they understood that was god one occasion this woman had heard that this man this blind man received his sight her baby died and she said if god could give a man who was blind and sight back god can raise my baby from the dead you see what i'm saying that's what those tapes are for to build your faith of things that has already happened and i say it like this if god amen open the blinded eyes then he can do it now if god raised the dead then he can do it now it wasn't the man it was the spirit in the man now they had shipped the capstone has come the god who was doing it all has now become visible to to those who truly believe even nicodemus was able to recognize something lord we know no man can do these things that you do except he except god be with him instead of preaching the power and the resurrection of jesus christ see that's what got us into trouble today we don't need any more high school and education from preachers and y'all know this is true the message went through a very intellectual stage and everybody thought they were in a revival but when they came out of revival there was no power behind what they learned you don't have to acknowledge it i was there i've seen it and everybody flocked around the preachers who could bring it deeper but where is the change somewhere amen in all of that depth we miss the quickening you know why because in that age or in that little period of time men were being glorified and not god and that's why brother branham said see he said even in that message he said it's not good to say brother so-and-so did this and brother so-and-so did that he said because people have a tendency to look toward the man than god that's almost a direct quote so bringing it down to you where is your god where is your god where is your god if you got him in heaven still he's in the wrong place in that day you know i'm in the father the father's in me and i am in you and if you still got him in heaven you got him in the wrong place he needs to be here on the throne of your heart the bible says know ye not that i you are the temple of god my kingdom was of this but if my kingdom was of this world then my subject would fight my kingdom is above but he said when you pray pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth like it is on heaven i'm gonna leave that there by god's grace thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven however i'm living there i must come to live here that's the prayer he prayed back then the kingdom had not yet come but the kingdom has come the kingdom is the holy ghost is that the word it is the kingdom righteousness peace and joy where in the holy ghost so you got to understand this thing got a shift the pill of fire if you still got it above brother branham's head you got it in the wrong place the pillow fire has moved and it's behind the veil it's on the mercy seat oh you understand me he said well we hadn't seen the pillow fire well i've seen him in my day but you know what seeing the pillow fire didn't save me i've seen a lot of miraculous uh uh signs and everything on pictures but it does it didn't save me i remember when brother craig and i went down to jeffersonville we took a picture together above his head uh uh uh was the form of a dove and above my head was the form of a lamb but it didn't save me i've seen ministers with the pill of fire in their background and people goes to worship with them like there's some kind of god sent angel well no dayton and carl cora saw the pillar of fire if they had photography they could have showed them in the picture that doesn't save you nor does it make you elected is when the god of heaven comes down and abode with you just like he abode with his dear son and was able to say in whom i am well pleased to dwell in this is what this message is all about is to produce more messiahs little jesus is amateur gods and that's the only way it could ever come you must allow your will to die and his will to live let's stand in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise oh give me g [Music] give me jesus you can have all of this world but give me cheese oh in the
