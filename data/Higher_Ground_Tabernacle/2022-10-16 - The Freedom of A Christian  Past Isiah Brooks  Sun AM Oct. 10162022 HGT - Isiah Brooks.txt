his Mercy amen you may be seated for just a moment we have a past I think Bishop Daniels okay that's not him okay we thought he was one but anyway we just met my we thank God for his grace and his mercy God has been good to us amen some of you may have noticed the church on this side um well just the other day we met the pastor there he is from Liberia and uh he was interested in getting together their services start at 11 something and I told him actually I thought the brother in the back was him but they look a little like a light but nevertheless I thought it was amazing because there is a house next to ours that specialize in helping uh mental challenge children yes and my wife is always communicating and it was through her that I came to know him but we had a great fellowship and who knows where God will take us with this amen you love the Lord secondly we're going to have two services on Sunday this coming Sunday and then starting at three o'clock we'll start at 3 30. that's the evening service the morning service is a regular time we have communion during that service for those who want to take communion we'll have our brother Andy Schuler from Arizona Tucson Arizona he is the assistant to our brother we've had him here before it's been a while but he was a blessing to us then I know he'll be a blessing to us again so he'll be speaking here Sunday morning and because it's been a long time since I've been down to Iowa City here comes I'll be in Iowa City on Sunday morning he'll preached Sunday morning here and Sunday evening as well so let's pray for the meetings on this coming Sunday that God's perfect will be done in the name of Jesus Christ we also want to thank you foreign [Music] my sister was the only sister left myself our family have a tendency of dying at a young age and out of the 16 children my mother had had the truly says there's only three of us left I contribute my years to God's grace and I appreciate his uh giving me the years that I have for example I would have had with him by God's grace my sister had just turned 70 years old my son it has been a real trying time for me uh because I don't know I've never seen her live a Christian life but before she died she did tell me that she made things right with God and my video so I hold faster that is that God will have been gracious to her to join the um amen amen amen and we have our brother Simon's mom welcome [Applause] same smile and everything amen amen I've been looking forward to meeting you by God's grace now we're going to sing a little song and then we'll get right into the word of God maybe you've never walked a day in sin and you've never had to lift your life so black that light couldn't enter in maybe he never came at night to dry your eyes so swollen by the tears because of pain and sorrows no hope of tomorrow down through the years but he did it for me Jesus did it for me [Music] I can't help but praise him when I think of what I used to be [Music] by his grace I've been washed in his blood he took my shame upon his back oh the Crimson Flood now every time I hear the word oh something in my heart is dirt and I can feel God's Praises running in my soul maybe you never felt lost and alone and you've never felt a burning hell could someday be your home maybe you never needed someone to set you free but I know someone who needed him and that someone is me he did it for me Jesus did it for me foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] not every time I hear the word something in my Harvesters and I can feel God's Praises rumbling in my soul he did it for me Jesus did it for me [Music] I can't help but praise him when I think of what I used to be foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus did it for me [Music] I can't help but Praises when I think of what I used to be oh I've been redeemed by his grace [Music] think in my heart is dirt as I can feel God Praises running in my soul my soul my soul my soul I can feel God's Praises rumbling in my soul not every time I hear the word something in my heart is dirt I can feel God's Praises rumbling in my soul [Music] Hallelujah when I think about the goodness of Jesus and all that he's done for me my soul Cries Out Hallelujah and I thank God for saving me as we stand let us stand we are you know I I don't know about you all and the battles that you go through but if you're not fighting something's wrong yeah if you're not going through trials then Satan has you yeah this is not a time of picnicking but we are under uh the time of War even if we look in at our our political Realms you you have the conservatives against the Liberals but the Bride of Jesus Christ is needle neither because she's in the middle of the road but it shows us what's happening among the people the church World he's going to either be conservative in other words legalistic or you're going to be a liberal meaning that you just believe in grace and grace is going to let you do whatever you want to do yeah but the Bible tells us shall we continue in sin that Grace may evound God forbid as we stand I trust we're in the middle of the world being in the middle of the road means that you can love someone different from you and when they're right they're right and when they're wrong they're wrong but you could even you can still love them let's go to Saint John 3 16. he says and from there we'll read Ephesians 2 4 through 10. this we know the scripture and and more than likely we should be able to quote it by heart but this is a powerful scripture let me see you in the cultural and I trust that somehow God will Enlighten it to us this morning for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life is amen amen Ephesians 2 episode starting at the fourth verse but God who is rich in Mercy for this great love wherewith he loved us um even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved Hallelujah and have raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ that in the age to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus Christ for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God foreign for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God because not of works that's any man should boast said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them let us pray you know Heavenly Father once again we come before your throne thanking you for your grace thank you for God who lives in US [Music] protects us who leads us in a country who speaks to us who listens to us I thank you Father for being a prayer answering God we pray this morning that you would bless the service in a special way give us Grace to move out of your ways from all our unrighteousness in the blood of Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated views that's all I have been so encouraged by the word and since my uh sister passed and you know the thing that really uh excites me is [Music] because I know we're not far from translations the word of God has declared to us that the seventh seal is open it is but it's open to a particular people we know when brother Brandon was here we understood his mission and his mission was to reveal the son of man it was also to call out a bride out of denominations into the headship of Christ she becomes him he becomes her his righteousness robes her in his grace as the prophet of God no Creed but Christ no law but love and if we understand the preview of the Bride she was wasn't staying as she marched before the Lord and she walked according to the word she wasn't staying on a level plane but she was stepping upwards and that's how it is this message causes us to step upwards not backwards not to stay on the same plane but we're moving higher and higher and higher as I said on Wednesday this church is called The Higher Grounds if we don't move forward if we don't continue to move higher than the name we call our church will become a Blasphemous name Hallelujah that is what happens this is when Christian calls themselves Christians and are not Christians then you walk as a blasphemer um Hallelujah her footsteps the bride footsteps were ordered by the Lord ordered by the revealed word hallelujah and this revelation of who he is and what did it mean and and what he means to her because brings peace brings Joy it brings overcoming power yeah when we look in the scripture we see that God so loved the world so we move out of laodice Hallelujah brotherly kindness and all of the things that comes with [Applause] [Music] but until you move into Divine love Hallelujah Rapture don't live more the Rapture we'll only take those who have accomplished let me say it like this this one towards you the Rapture will only take those who have accomplished the gold for their age and that goal is it objective is divine love see hello somebody so you see why you have been chosen in the most wicked age ever you're living in the age where the house is divided like I said if we want a Revival in this church before we can fix the church we must fix the family hello amen before we can fix the church each family must be fixed is that the Bible where you get that from even in the Exodus when Moses were getting ready to deliver the children out of Egypt every family had to come together each family had to come together and each family had to have the blood on the doorpost and the little you see the family has to be fixed it brings the church into one Union hallelujah amen come on somebody we're not a union by way of law hallelujah we're not a union by way of creed this church because we all come here does not bring us into Oneness Hallelujah only the wit the only way you and I can come into Oneness with the Holy Ghost the Bible says so by one Spirit are you baptized into one body Hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ comes to understand he doesn't just need the Holy Ghost but she needs a mature she needs to lay in the presence of the sun Hallelujah but we also understand that though we go through our trials God is still rich in Mercy Hallelujah it is God who began to walk in you it is God who's going to finish it Hallelujah I'm counting on it Hallelujah is that all right see it was God's grace that was given to Noah in the time of the antiluvian day it was God's grace it wasn't nothing Noah did it Hallelujah see it's nothing you can do to marry God's grace his grace is unnarrative hallelujah but is his knowledge of who you are come on somebody it's God's knowledge of who you are is that right the Bible says that the Lord knows them that are his because it was God who gave Noah instructions on how to build the ark Hallelujah see Noah didn't have his own blueprints it was God who gave nor that blueprints because I mean let me tell you this listen when frios come if you don't know who you are Satan as as as Jesus told Peter desire to sift you as wheat and that's the problem let me say it like this y'all sitting down there acting like I'm a lettering to you let me say something your ordinances your rules your regulations means nothing to God and most of us judge one another because of our laws our rules and our regulations hello that's what brings undenominationalism hello right now meant to know in this assembly we have some here some here it's something you know what's dividing you your self-righteousness because you think you can fast and somebody else can I'm just using it for an example you think you're more holy your Holiness don't doesn't even come by your words Hallelujah is that right you must understand he became our sins that we might become his righteousness it is God who will not impute Sins Not that you don't sin it is God who will not charge you because he justified Hallelujah see if we could really see that it's important we're coming here jumping almost Hallelujah because we realize that he whom the son is set free is free indeed hallelujah amen just escaping this age has the ability to escape this age you know the battles you go through you know how often you fall every day you know the thoughts that goes through your mind every day Hallelujah that's why I said when I think of the goodness of Jesus my soul Cries Out Hallelujah I thank God for saving me hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah somebody who can give us righteousness somebody who can not impute our sins we didn't know that Hallelujah but at the revealing of the word he told us that we've been Justified Hallelujah as though we've never sinned in the first place I don't know about you but that brings your joy when I realized today no matter what I go through there's no condemnation of God hallelujah what you saying brother bro I'm saying this morning there's a freedom in this message it's by your own mind it's by your own way of thinking it's by your own way of Hallelujah because God has set you free Hallelujah that's the problem this message become a war ground a ground for war so massage it's it's a it's not supposed to be that this church versus that church where is the Brotherly Love where's the brotherly kindness Hallelujah you see I can't fellowship with you Hallelujah cause you have communion in the morning and I have communion in the evening Hallelujah and brother Brandon said communion should be done in the evening and at the same token brother Brandon had communion in the coming of the new year you understand me early in the morning Hallelujah not late in the evening you see no laws y'all understand me and when you do those kind of things you separate yourself and place yourself in bondage you know we don't quoted this message so much we worked in the Catholic creeds and most people that quoted it don't even understand it see how sad y'all look is I know what I'm talking about you see because if you don't come to a place let me ask you a question if you judge continue to judge others by your righteousness Hallelujah you see what I'm saying so he said that's what we do but you know what we do when we fail Jesus said how many of y'all know it's wrong Camille adultery now to raise your hand s it's wrong but Jesus put it on the plane some of y'all ain't never done it physically but he said if you think within your heart you've done it already hello so he puts everybody on a plane the same place you need help I need help need everybody need help you hear what I'm saying companies but because you've never done it doesn't mean you never thought it this is hallelujah and in the eyes of the Lord you just as guilty but I know somebody who can take away the guilty stain it is the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah this is what this message has done for us it has allowed us to free ourselves foreign [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying brother Brandon we had it once a month at least that's what we know hey almost excuse me but my point is we don't even have it once a month [Music] Hallelujah so are you going to condemn yourselves because you don't have it once a month that's nonsense nonsense amen amen but people will leave the church y'all don't have communion enough you know what I ain't worrying about y'all leaving cause y'all don't show up I'm gonna tell it just like y'all know I'm gonna tell it yeah maybe one or some time where are the Christians because a person who's afraid of communion you're not a Christian you're pretending to be one day [Music] um I don't know something pulled me way off the word way off of where I should come up we are in a place that we've seen the Pentecostal moves right we've seen the anointing on us we've seen an awning with us we've seen the anointing speaking in tongues but we're beyond that y'all hear what I'm saying let me say Let me let me say it like this do you know there are still people in this message who believe that the seals have not yet been okay now where did that put them you understand me they still believe they read the same books they listen to the same tapes but they've separated themselves because one believed the seals are open and the other one you see the trick of the devil is the devil that got him divided who gives revelation revelation it is God who gives Revelation and when God gave Peter the revelation of who he was never said I'm separating myself from you because you don't have the true Revelations Hallelujah but I believe Peter remembered when Jesus said that the mystery is given unto you I might get it before you but I know you're going to get it oh somebody help me here see what I'm trying to do is liberate you in your thoughts right that's why God made it up an individual thing everybody think their church is going to come sweeping through the city it ain't gonna be your church oh friend of mine who is a Baptist Minister he said brother Brooks I believe that the Baptist Doctrine closest to the word than anybody else you know what I laughed I said everybody believed that every Church believes it's the closest to the words if it wasn't so they wouldn't stay where they are and in the passage we're doing the same thing Hallelujah let me tell you the closest those who got the Holy Ghost the revelation of this message is the ceiling of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah brother it he called this message his holy ghost message you sent this please and that's after the shields and remember his wife when she talked to him you know why we why what happened why I'm gone because you fail or we failed news of a monkey could join those Pentecostals we were wrong oh come on somebody the you know I I brewed a little bit of coffee in the back if you need it right there yeah God forgive me but the point is when we see ourselves dividing ourselves because of frivolous things that don't mean nothing you say oh it doesn't matter it doesn't matter remember Peter was setting among the Gentiles and then when when when when Paul came in oh the Jews came in Peter separated himself and joined himself back to the Jews Paul rebuked him for such a prejudice is in the same Holy Ghost that rebuke Peter is rebuking you today for such nonsense nonsense would that feel good too oh what's the problem problem we need more holy ghost Zombies that's what we need we need more God in this place now you know we supposed to be greater some people said higher than the Pentecostal Church if I was a visitor coming in here you see and looking at y'all don't use foreign I'm like my God my God my God like that song say give me a smile yeah no no that's all I'm saying we in a place it's my trials are so heavy um like I said my trial is so heavy how many of y'all took the cross how many of you did you carry the cross of Calvary you climbed the the mountain of Golgotha did they pierce you in your size did they smack you in your face did they spit on you what's going on compare what you're going through to what Jesus Christ went through to bring this to you see I know I'm being Elementary but this is what God gave me to give message see until you come to understand that Christ lives within you let me tell you something the song John shows the Holy Ghost fears nothing is and when you've got the Holy Ghost you don't have to fear nothing the real Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost on fear you ever seen in the scripture where God ever feared anything unless you got a different Revelation than mine but my Revelation is that Jehovah of the Old Testament it's Jesus Christ of the new there is not a second person or third person there's only one person and if that one person exists in me he acts the same way when Satan can take your job how about my notes now when Satan can take your job he's defeated Hallelujah [Music] God he did not look at circumstances he looked at the promises of the word hallelujah and he gave us a word [Music] I don't know about you but I am a believer Hallelujah I am a believer you say brother Brooks do you get sick sometimes yes do you have valid sometimes yeah oh yeah sometimes are you are you in a dark place sometimes yes but one thing I realized he's my shepherd if I'm in a dark place he led me there yeah Hallelujah if I'm sick he allowed it to be soaked Hallelujah but one thing I know this message has made me and that is an overcomer Hallelujah I'm more than overcome you this morning I preached not long ago you take the challenge you don't wait till the devil come back at you you take the challenge is that right it was David and his brothers running from Dave uh Goliath Hallelujah but David took it took the battle to the Giants I can't help but to use my own testimonies how God may have gave me Victory you know why because I refuse me I don't care to let him become a winner of Victor over me if it means I've got a fight and fight and fight Hallelujah I am a Victor it's not me like Paul said it's not I that lives but it's Christ that lives in me Hallelujah man what I'm I'm in the book you should see the relief you're in the book Hallelujah I understand where I'm standing there's a component this is not some kind of thing where I've got to feel God we always say I feel him in my soul we don't feel God in our souls there ain't no feeling in your soul yep I do feel them in my soul there's no feeling in your soul and God purposed it to be that way because he does not want you to go by your feelings hello he don't want you going by your feet oh I feel those your song I don't feel like I'm saved sometimes see ain't hardly nobody said amen I don't feel safe sometimes what your feelings got to do with that feeling has nothing to do the devil can use your feelings anytime is that all right it's not about feelings faith is a revelation let me ask you a question because I'm trying to I'm trying to bring you up Hallelujah faith is a revelation Hallelujah let me ask you a question how come you believe this message what made you believe it well because daddy gave it to you this is Mama gave it to you let me tell you something this is not a second-handed religion for yourself and people think because I'm so deep I understand the opening up the words I know all those things I know how many trips brother Brianna made and how many rabbits he shot just like a brother showed me the other day a man who said I love brother Brandon more than I love Jesus Christ that man ain't even say it's a dominant box and let me tell you something about her if I have to hear if I was in the church if somebody said that they would hear the door open boom they wouldn't even see me I'll be running out there with all I've got y'all understand me William random must have been our Prophet but let me tell you something I'll save you as Jesus Christ how can you Lobster you most of the people in it you've never met William Brown Hallelujah and William Branham cannot occupy your soul but Jesus Christ Jesus the one that occupies your soul so how can you love something more than the man who occupies that's nonsense this is your nonsense I don't know I don't heard a lot of things but that was more bizarre than anything oh God let me tell you something those of us who something else so you can understand you can't stay where you are spiritually you cannot stay where you are and expect to make a Rapture I didn't say you wasn't saved I'm saying you cannot stay where you are still the Holy Ghost the spirit of Christ in you he's going to take you higher he's going to take you higher you understand me and if you're standing still this is what you call backslidden you gotta grow in the grace of God hallelujah now I don't know I'm off my nose but the thing about it let me come down to this because the Bible says if you can't love your brother Montana then you did you're deep when you can love your enemies when you can love those that the unlovable your jeans deeply in love with him hallelujah amen now here I'm going now I'm almost done I'm a little over but let me go go anyway yeah I'll continue how many of y'all would come back to second service that's what I thought so so give me a few more minutes amen well at least you're honestly one thing about Abraham's seeds he staggered not at the promise of God glory to God and this is the part on the 21st verse and being full blend conviction that what he what he promised for me he was able also to perform you know this is the way I look at it in brother Brown's Ministry the Lord raised the Dead Brother Brown the Lord healed cancer the Lord uncrossed eyes God even extended limbs how do you all know that right given uh extended limbs Hallelujah is that right in brown Obama's Ministry amen God even heal club foot feet I mean um there was nothing there was no challenge everything the devil can God cast out Devils so much Soul he described what these demons look like hello somebody foreign [Music] but the pride of Jesus Christ has a measure of discernment all of the signs and wonders we don't seek them but they're supposed to follow us I'm persuaded this old boy and I'm gonna tell you something Satan has been attacking my mind like he's never attacked it before and just the other day it was bad I was tired I suffered in my spirit so many things were going on because it was like almost dimensional I could hear people thoughts and it just seemed like Satan was just coming at me in such a way you know I was at my home I mean my wife not understanding what's going on with me but God led me to this message he began to bring something to me he began to revive Me by and through the word of God he made me remember who I really am what I'm here for hello and he also reminded me no weapon formed against you foreign [Applause] [Music] evolutionary [Music] how many all believe I noticed why but I'm trying to encourage you like God encouraged me let God break the chains every one of us come from different places we come to the message and I guess we try to uh incorporate a lot of things into the message that's not even there all that stuff got to go you will never be free until you let it all go y'all hear what I'm saying I'm trying to tell you you'll never be free until you let it all go my point is you need to know Jesus Christ I only know one thing and that Jesus Christ and him crucified and I'm gonna know him I just don't want to know him in the power of his resurrection but I want to know him in his suffering as well that's when you know you know you love him so we're coming down to the end of the message you know what God did for us he declared righteousness by his grace and I'm gonna say it like this again when you have come through a church all the churches and about laws and rules and regulations literally killing you it's literally putting you in bondage in prison books [Music] some things preachers preach on yeah if you had the Holy Ghost he would never have to preach on it y'all hear what I'm saying for example the Bible says two can't walk together except they agree um yeah all of us are in here foreign hmm we go to we go to work we're unbelieversion and people say don't you have nothing to do with them they ain't Christianity and so you carry yourself out of um like you're so much better and you think they want your Christianity they do not I wouldn't want it you know what Jesus did so that's because she's very Faith he knew he saw a woman at the well and he went to Fellowship in Italy community y'all hear me there was a woman in Simon's house now y'all gotta know that look bad now y'all know what I'm saying it looked real bad it's Simon's house it looked just as bad as it did when that couple was on the front row no school and brother Brown was meeting out that's what he said so busy and he was this woman in Simon's house who everybody knew she was a prostitute amen washing his feet crying I don't know about you but if I had seen that message in my natural mind I probably would have thought well you know he knows she knows him they must have just had a breakup I'm just saying in my natural mind I would have thought something was going on but Jesus cared nothing about it he knew that about Jesus Christ if you can't do that you don't need to be with them oh come on somebody but what I'm trying to say is that you'll never win somebody to church with your religious mind oh Hallelujah I have friends right now who are dominational Christians he's on the the Chris they come to my house even during his own they've listened to a few messages they can't see it at this point what am I supposed to do because I ain't got nothing else to do with it you see what we do when God took all that time with you to make you see this message and we want to judge somebody because we give them a book and they say hey it ain't for me it may not be for them at that time you don't cut them off you allowed them to see the Christ in you hmm y'all think I'm crazy no I'm not because let me tell y'all something and I'm getting ready to close I'm closing now for real my message went totally different but let me tell you like this there's someone with Jacob CC sometimes we do things we're not aware of it the fund is on the shoulders is that right is it why now I'm gonna say it like this my wife and I can't speak French my father wanted but there have been times before we've been left out don't get quiet it's true and y'all know we don't speak Frenchie but then many of you won't even stand up and say hey I I interpret foreign [Music] I want to laugh too but what I'm saying will do that not realizing the brother that other sister that's left out she walks away feeling bad walk away feeling unloved in me I don't know I can speak for myself like man them people don't respect me now point is this more point somebody raised up would be an interpreter yeah yeah somebody need to raise up and be an interval yeah Hallelujah and and you know what can I say it like this those who speaks wild healing can't speak French somebody need to raise up and be an interpreter nobody likes to be left out foreign okay it's a true it's everyday I'm gonna stop because I want y'all to see how simple things can be and how people have their own little prejudices and don't even know it come on this is that right you know I'm saying this we we're covered by the blood and I believe with all my heart because I can't judge you but you'll be perfect I don't know who you are but I'm believing that everybody in here will be his bride that God is going to somehow bring us all together I believe that that's why I work so hard on the thing I want to see us Unified but I can see I can see that this Union is not there I can't do it I can't do it it takes you evil you have to do it she don't speak to me I ain't gonna speak to her good luck with that oh I tell you one thing what brother random says when that pressure and squeeze come on we're not going to worry about what your Doctrine is you're going to be so glad to see a Christian Hallelujah he ain't gonna say who Church who's Pastor your pastors not passing the message I don't know where yours is true you see what I'm saying let me ask you something any questions I'm almost done I'm Gonna Let You Go cause I know I can feel it I can feel it how many of you can truly say that you see yourself Growing Experience let me tell y'all something listen I don't believe like some of these people believe just push play but I do believe in push and play listen those tapes is a voice for a reason it's not just book only but voice I have been healed by listening to those tapes I have been delivered delivery by listening to those times see I don't see a man I see a god coming through those tapes it's really it's the word in voice form we are such a privileged privilege privileged some privilege that we can see that and I'm gonna tell you like this somebody said to me they don't like the way he sounded God ain't ask you to like the way he sounds um God did not say you're going to like the way he was supposed to sound working with the sound he's working with the words I've been trying to come off this plane where I'm at right now my Earnest desires to see a church unifies [Music] when I was in Lime Ohio I'm not comparing Papa but I started out with 13 people they were all old as far as tithing is concerned I may have been getting like 500 a month that carried almost for years he said but did I quit man scripture is stupid I didn't care about the money my supplier is not been Ben Franklin or whoever my Supply is Jesus Christ you see my thought is this I'm going to work I'm going to do all I can to be a blessing to this church to help you as much as I can and as much as the Lord will allow me the preaching the word that will bring us into Oneness because I realized if I continue to preach this way you know what I'm saying getting kind of like into your life you're going to either stay or you're going to leave but I know one thing about the Bride of Jesus Christ she wants to be corrected I don't know about you I want to be correct I don't want nothing following me I don't want a truckload of sin coming behind me you understand me I want everything up front like that old man say I don't want no trouble at the river in closing God if he'd given you a battle see Jules are called during bad day he know you can beat it if there's a battle in your life he knows you are the Victor he's secretary he knows you can overcome he knows every battle is hamstring hand designed for you it it for me I can't fight your battles and you can't fight mine but every battle you go through has been personalized but God also know if you said you're going to come out as a winner less than live on I trust Mrs Bell let everybody understand brother Brandon said only perfect love foreign [Music] is something about flowers when the flower has nectar in it those screw the the floor that sweet stuff um it never has to put a sign out there [Music] um no the bird leaves the beef leaves everything that love nectar it's going to come and get dip into that flower why because that nectar was made for them that's how it is we are supposed to be lilies and some people said the floor is that right and we understand a crush Lily it's what brings us to be a Christian foreign [Music] oh may God help us let's continue to say we all need more of him I wasn't here to criticize you but I'm here to open and bring a word that may allow us to see where we're standing here maybe I'm the only one but that you should have but I really believe that we're not so far from the translation [Music] we're all ready it's on the moon in World War Three because the bomb haven't dropped here doesn't mean the bomb is not coming Hallelujah is that right she said why well think about the Saints over there in Ukraine how would they interpret that before one bomb dropped a Vulcan bomb will be gone how would they interpret that when the bombs are dropping brother was referring to with this United States before one bomb drops the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone it's already in the East it's going to travel to the West so we better refocus that's more important Jesus Christ [Music] we're going to sing Amazing Grace [Music] oh me Amazing Grace how sweet
