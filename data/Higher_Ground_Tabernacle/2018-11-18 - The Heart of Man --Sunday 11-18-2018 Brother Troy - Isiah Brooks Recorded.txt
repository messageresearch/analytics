Matthew chapter 13 read the Matthew 13 and we'll read the 15th through the 19th verse speak a message this morning called the heart of man amen and verse verse 15 it says for this people's heart is waxed gross their ears are dull of hearing their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and hear that have not seen them and hear those things which he hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received the seed by the wayside hey man let's just our hasn't reward prayer one more time Heavenly Father we just asked Lord that right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord in your precious name father that this word that Lord that you spoke Lord 2,000 years ago father as we read it again father that we will be transported back in time father and receive it the same Lord to receive it by your Holy Spirit father that this word would not just fall upon deaf ears this morning Lord but Lord that your word would go down into the heart of man Lord and Lord it would not be a hardened heart father but I'd be a heart that is alive to receive your word and I'm asking that Lord on behalf of this people that their hearts will be softened Lord by your word that my hear see and understand and be converted Lord to be to be exactly what you desired them to be on this world Laura for the very purpose that you died on the cross the we would fulfill that purpose in our heart and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you you could be seated amen you know when I was when you grow up as a as a young man is a Christian you begin going to church you know and and you know you always hear that Jesus wants to come into your heart you know and it's one of the popular things in sunday schools and in different places and every church you know is is that you know have you asked Jesus into your heart you know I think just about everybody here could say that they've heard that phrase you know have you asked Jesus into your heart you know and when I was a child you know that was such a simple thing you know and you know even my wife has told me you know that when she was a child that she would actually imagine you know that that you know being able that there was a little Jesus walking around inside of her heart you know and and because of that she just believed that what she was told that Jesus would come into your heart amen you know and then and you know when you think about the simplicity of the gospel that's what we're looking for is that the almighty Lord Jesus Christ would come into our heart you know and we heard that in Sunday school it was such a such a simple saying but yet is so powerful and so true we want Jesus to come into our heart don't we say it's amen amen and you know and you when you come into this message and you see the mysteries begin to open up unto you and you go down to the deepness of the gospel and you and this Bible becomes in a whole new book to you and and you go through all of the mysteries of the seals and and the wonderful things are brought out to us and you come full-circle right back around to Jesus Christ coming back into your heart and it's like now now I understand now I see now my eyes have been opened Jesus Christ is in my heart amen and you know and after going through the deepness of the gospel and all the mysteries I come right back around to that thing that I heard in under school in Sunday school but now I understand now I see now my eyes have been open the understanding of my heart has been open now Jesus Christ is in my heart you know and Jesus when Jesus came to to this world and he began to draw him in unto himself the first thing that he had to do was to begin working on their hearts why because their hearts had been darkened their hearts had been hardened and the very first thing that Jesus had to do is he had to begin working on their hearts amen so what'd he do he went around and he began to show who he was by the mighty power that he had and you know there'll be miracles there would be signs and well he didn't have to show off about it amen he just had to walk and change things and be and do things according to his kingdom amen if he saw somebody who is sick he would look and he'd say you know in my kingdom that man shouldn't be sick like that Amen so what'd he do he just simply changed the man's position to be like what he was supposed to be that man is supposed to be healed and when his disciples began to see those things also it drew their attention what their eyes were open to see something and in that moment at a time as their eyes were opened and they began to consider who is this and as he spoke those words they would enter into his ears and they would fall upon their heart and their heart was being softened to receive the word their heart was being changed now not everybody had received that experience many understood many of you many heard the exact same words they saw the exact same miracles and those words of the Lord Jesus would actually go down into their ears and actually hit their heart but their heart had been so hardened that no matter what the creator did for them they would not receive it amen now as we were reading there in Matthew chapter 13 verse 10 it says now the disciples came and said unto Him why speakest thou unto them in parables Jesus answer he say answer and said to them because it is given unto you that to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath Tim shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from hid from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not and they hearing hear not neither do they understand Amen now when when Jesus called some of the disciples he said you know you know I saw you off when you were praying under the tree I saw you now how did you see me how did you know I was praying he's like well my eyes I saw you while you were praying now you weren't standing in there or an awesome the understanding he began to understand that that which was being done could not be done by mortal man his understanding began to be opened now when his understanding began to be open what I do it created a soft spot in his heart to where the Word of God could start coming down inside of his heart and changing him transforming him from the person that he was into a new creation and to a new creature because that's what Christ came to do you know Christ he didn't come for us to have hardened hearts they men BS some people the more he preached the harder their hearts got you know then that's then this way it is with all the gospel every time the gospel is preached some people's hearts gets softer some people's hearts gets harder amen so seeing that they might see and understand but some will never never understand some don't want to understand and even though they might think you know I saw something that could not be done by mortal man and no reason in their minds man cannot do that but yet it comes into a conflict in their own mind that if I go down that path and believe that thing then I would have to submit to it and give myself up to it and so they shut it right down right there and the heart becomes hard and because they do not do not want to give up to that thing amen so how can Christ ever get to him no their hearts been hardened they can't do it so what Jesus said when he was given this parable out when he get down to verse 18 there he says here he therefore the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received the seed by the wayside I think about her so the man though the word went into his ears went down to his heart but he didn't understand it and what so Satan is right there and he couldn't he's right there now what he has an entrance into that man and what does he do he catches away the word you know I've seen people like that and I've seen people like that I've seen people listen to the word memorize the word think about it talk about it able to discuss it Amen even able to go down and go through the pages and have the word and all this and there they're able to bring an eloquent response to the word and they're able to sympathize with the word but because they don't actually fully accept the word that they all suddenly begin to fall away and when you look at that man years down the road and you go up and you talk to him now you cannot find any speck of that word that they used to know that the understanding that they seem to have back then now that understanding is is completely gone I know if you've ever if you ever experience that one time it'll amaze you because you like now wait a second I talked to you years ago we fell a shift over the word we talked we discussed the word we fellowship with it we're having communion with the word and now I can't even find that word that you used to have why because the Bible says that when you do not understand that which you seamless to have that which it looks like you have even that which you do have will be taken away why because they didn't let it grow in their hearts amen so not only do you have to have the word come down into your ears not only does it have to get on the field of your heart your fart your heart your heart has to be in a certain condition so that the word can grow and if your heart is not in that condition then you are going to lose that which you've been hurt now think about it we enjoy we enjoy how the spirit shows up in these services we've all had our ears tickled by wonderful messages amen and things that come down from the glory of heaven you know and how Elkin a man can go through the pages of the gospel and bring out a message and we are just in awe listen to it what is it doing that that word is coming down into our minds and it's and it's an amazing thing to see and it's filtering down and down to our heart and it hits that field of our heart and we can rejoice over it we can enjoy it we can they be glad over we can accept it but if our heart is in the wrong condition we can lose every single speck of that which we are so happy receive because of the condition that our heart is in they say oh no I'm gonna I'm gonna hold on to that I'm gonna hold on to this so closely yeah this is mine I'm gonna let me tell you I don't care how much you try to hold on to it if your heart is not in the right condition you will lose everything that you think you have why because it has to do with the condition that your heart is in amen think about Jesus you know how how did he love his disciples you know and he and he said you know when he had the celebrated the last Passover and he was taking the community breathe in deep he said you know with desire I have desire to eat this with you on the earth with desire I have I have longed with a heartfelt desire I have longed to fellowship with you over the blood of the lamb over the over the Passover lamb I was that lamb back in Moses day I am that same lamb today and now here on my on the Passover I am here to to have this right on the eve of my crucifixion I am here to celebrate the Passover with you I am going to shed my blood for your sins I am going to wash you white like snow I am going to fill you with the Holy Ghost I'm going to change you from the creatures of man to be in a son or a daughter of God with desire I've had this desire to have fellowship with you and yet when when as they are having that meal Satan enters into Judas's heart the Bible says and Satan enters into Judas's heart and his heart is sealed away from the Lord Jesus Christ now God came Jesus came to to operate on Judas's heart amen the whole time the Judas was working with them I was working as a disciple of Christ those words Jesus came to operate in that heart but that heart was hardened it could not receive the word amen so what so now when Satan there was no there was a position where Satan could enter into that heart and what what happened as soon as Satan entered into the heart of Judas he was sealed away they meant sohere Christ with desire a desire to fellowship with me but Judas would not couldn't do it amen and so is there with anybody they'll come to church day in day out their ears can be tickled with the wonderful messages amen they'll rejoice but that which they seem us to have no matter how much they can no matter how much they can quote the word with you they can fellowship or the word they can bring some great thoughts but if they they can lose every single bit of that word if they do not receive Christ in their heart amen their heart because the heart has to be in a certain condition for that word to grow if your heart does not get into that condition I don't care how much you hear it I don't care how much you sympathize it I don't care how much you believe it if your heart does not get into that condition to receive the word then you can lose every single bit of it you think oh no no no no I'm gonna hold on to this III you in your own power you can't do it you cannot hold on to it that what you seemeth to have will be taken away from you amen verse 22 it says he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the carrot now where are these thorns at there in the heart there's thrown thorns and this is all relating to the heart of man there's thorns growing in this man's heart he's also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word he becometh unfruitful but he the received seed into the good ground now where is this good ground at that's the heart of man amen neither receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some one hundredfold some sixty and some thirty now think about as Jesus Christ was choosing his disciples amen he was the whole time that he was working with them he was trying to change their heart so that they could completely receive his word now you think all the the moment that they the very moment that they rejects sold all that they had and receive Christ's are following them their heart was prepared no it wasn't ready yet Jesus was working on their hearts that entire three and a half year times this was a process their heart they were not ready to receive the full word on day one or on year one not even on year two or on year three they were still not in a condition to where they could receive the full word of God amen well now remember what what was Jesus trying to do he was trying to redeem them and trying to enter into their heart that Jesus Christ might fill them with the Holy Ghost amen amen now it's uh now inverse fit now what look at that verse 15 he said there he said for this people's heart is waxed gross it's become thick it's it's become so a point where it can't receive the word their ears are dull fearing their eyes they have closed us any time they should see with their eyes and hear theirs and they should understand with heart and should be converted and I should heal them that's the last part Jesus was there to heal them amen by an order for them to be healed to become the people that they ought to be their heart had to be changed amen you know it takes a total surrender for your heart to be changed like that amen you know in Matthew 5 when he first started preaching to his disciples we you know he had the Sermon on the Mount and he says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God you know they shall see God if you're a car's not pure you won't see him Amen let's turn it over to mark chapter 8 yeah I remember as a child you know we we door-to-door witness Enon and I remember that I didn't have a testimony at that time you know I I'd prayed the sinner's prayer but uh you know but when we went door-to-door and I tried to you know they told they taught us the day before what we should say when we knocked on their door and and all that and and be you knowing the door and the door was answer and the person opened the door all I could say was that which I had in my memory I couldn't express to the person salvation you know and I always bothered me because I wanted to be a witness I knew you ought to be a witness but yet when the person answered the door I didn't have anything to say you know and and the same thing why because they hadn't entered into my heart yet Jesus was calling me he was drawing me he is pulling me but yeah I hadn't received Christ inside my heart yet amen mark chapter 8 verse 15 it says and he charged him beware take heed beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread and when Jesus knew it he said unto them why reason ye because he have no bread / CV not neither understand have ye your heart yet hardened having eyes see you know having ears hear you not and do you not remember when I break the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took he up and they said an to him twelve and when the seven thousand when the seven among the four thousand how many baskets full fragments took he up and I said seven and he said to him how is it the Iduna understand so here he is he's been out walking with them how many years now he's been preaching the word to him he's been preaching the gospel to him they've they're walking with or with Jesus Christ the word itself the same one that created the heavens and the earth and they're not even understanding that he is the one that no how did how did this bread feed 5,000 tell me tell me how did this fish feed 5,000 how did this loaf of bread feed 5,000 how is it that you do not understand why is your heart still hardened you know they just thought those miracles were kind of neat and I think that's where a lot of people are they think this message is kind of neat they think this is kind of cool you know they think this is something that your place is kind of a nice thing to be able to I'm smarter than all the other Christians out there I I know something a little bit better that they don't know or or maybe I'm a little bit better of a doctrine than the church next door and I just think this is kind of neat that's the condition that they are in but Christ here he's walking with his disciples and he's still trying to get them to understand that the creator of the heavens and earth has come down to earth and he is drawing men unto himself trying to get them to become sons and daughters of God and they cannot I understand that he is the very one that created the heavens and the earth and said they're just wow that's like kind of like a little magician's trick isn't it you know and and you know we and we take no you say oh no I I don't do that but don't you realize that when you come to this message and you don't submit your heart 100% under the Lord Jesus Christ you are doing the same thing every single person that comes to this message that comes to the Lord Jesus Christ and does not get down on their knees and say Oh Lord God have mercy upon me I am a center lor forgive me Lord I got to be changed any person that it does not give up their lives for Christ is the same in the same boat do you not understand how is it that your heart is still hardened why are you allowing the cares of this world the riches of this world to harden your heart why are you choking the words with the throne they're girly with the thorns are growing up in your heart why have you not prepared your heart to receive the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ because we're in the same boat they were amen Christ is still here amen the Creator is still here amen he's still doing things trying to get us a see and understand that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen that he's still alive that he still reigns that he's still got a man he ought to be served that he ought to be loved amen though his is that this message is worth giving our lives unto the Lord Jesus Christ 100% but when you come here and you give up a half-hearted heart or you come halfway to the Lord Jesus Christ you're doing the same things you've harden your heart and that which you seem to have the enemy can come take it away why because that was not sealed down within you amen you say oh no I'm gonna hold on to this but if let me tell you if you come only halfway in Christ you will lose everything you have because that what you seem to have will be taken away from you and so many times you know you look at someone who you think all that person used to be a Christian how did they fall so far you think I would never do that every single person that does not submit themselves 100% of the Lord Jesus Christ will find themselves in the same boat because Jesus has come for the entire heart of man amen and now heart has to be in a certain condition to receive him and if that heart never gets to that condition you will not receive the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart okay man think about it that word and those the one that received the the word by the way sight the one that received the word amongst the thorns you know the one that had the birds come and take the seed away word that seed land it came in their ears and weighed down and landed on the surface of their heart but their heart was in the wrong condition or see the word so it comes down to what is the condition of your heart amen only the pure in heart shall see God how is it that you do not understand that I am he let's turn over to Luke chapter 24 this scripture amazes me because now we're now we're three and a half years down the road they have been walking with the Lord Jesus Christ for three and a half years that's a long time three and a half years they slept with him they ate with him they travel with him they walk down the road they everywhere they went they've been walking with three-and-a-half years and their heart was still not in the condition to completely receive him he still has to work on their heart think about it he's still at this point has to work on their heart sometimes we think we're we were so far off the road Luke chapter 24 verse 25 this is the road to Emmaus he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself amen now let's go down to Lois's keep reading and they and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for this toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meet with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them and their eyes were opened and heated and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight now I think about he's already died he's risen again amen and then any and he still what's he's trying to do he's still going around trying to finish up the work of the last three and a half years trying to get their heart in the condition for Pentecost amen after three and a half years amen he's already done his job on the earth amen he's already redeemed them of their sins he's already been the slain lamb the sacrifice and he has to come back and he appears to him over here he appears unto them over there he disappears here he disappears over there because he's going around still he's still working on their heart just trying to get them in a condition to go to Pentecost after three and a half years their heart still wasn't ready for Pentecost you know we come to these church we come to services and we think we know so much of the word we can talk about the things that Christ has done we can talk about the miracles have been done in our midst we can talk about the testimonies of others have had something done or we even we ourselves God come down and heal us you can deliver us you can set us free we can understand the seals and the mysteries and all these things but yet God still is trying to get our heart in a condition that will give ourselves under the Lord Jesus Christ so we can go to Pentecost why and we think that we have so much and we don't have the first thing the first basis amen think about how much they knew about Jesus Christ after three and a half years think about how many sermons they had heard but yet their understanding was darkened and they still didn't understand this is the creator they could voice it with their mouth but dick but they weren't ready for Pentecost amen so he comes and he shows up he appears unto Him trying to so why he disappeared because their eyes were understanding were opened and they knew that was him my job here is done they're ready for Pentecost amen they know that I am he amen you know there's times that you can you can think that you know something I can tell you something but all sudden when it strikes your heart and your heart is ready to receive it this is the Lord Jesus Christ this is him this war in this world begins to melt away and the things of this world and all the riches and our careers and our and all those things all sudden start to become foolishness and we begin to realize he is the Christ he is the Messiah because no now look why are we here because Christ has been drawing us amen why why do we even go to church why do we give up our Sundays you know why don't we just go out there and you know go enjoy the sports and do other things like that but something about us says Christ has drawn us to himself amen was he trying to do he's trying to get us in a condition that we submit to him so that we can become the bride of Lord Jesus Christ amen and when our eyes of our understanding could be open to realize that which has been laid before us and that is worth submit giving our lives up to it is worth submitting ourselves to it is worth giving giving 80 years of existence on this earth up for then our eyes of our understanding be k opened amen and that's what Christ is trying to do trying to get us to receive him trying to open up the soften our heart why so that we don't just sit here in church week in week out with hardened hearts able to debate the word but not able to receive the word amen and what happened as soon as as soon as he disappeared what they say didn't our hearts burn within us why what was he doing he has heart surgery he is going in there is our how their hearts were burning why because he was there's ruling away the rocks and the soil his heart he is creating a place what the word could go in there so I can start that so it could be like a seed he could start start growing and growing and growing didn't our hearts burn within us as he walked with us along the way well he was heart surgery amen he was trying doing he's doing little bit of heart surgery so they could be ready for Pentecost what happened on Pentecost that which their heart was the work was done ready to be sealed they had received the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior they knew who he was hey man we can talk about receive him as our Savior we can think about it you know and you know sometimes you hear testimonies of a so so-and-so oh I got thank Jesus you know he healed me or he delivered me and you hear all these all these testimonies and there's just something about it they're not a lot to get their lives are not submitted unto the Lord Jesus Christ here we come to Thanksgiving and everybody's and we sit around the table thanking God for all the blessings that he has given I'm not realizing that if they don't get Jesus Christ down the inside of their heart it'll all be taken away in a moment in a twinkling of an eye many will be cast out into outer darkness weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth why because they never received Christ in their heart they could talk about the word they could debate the word they can think about the word but until Christ has given the preeminence in your life and you got a long ways to go amen let's turn over to Romans chapter 10 Romans 10 verse verse 8 but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach with which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved you know I've heard that verse as I was as a child you know really until you know what is submitting yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ how does one you know how does one believe in your heart that Jesus has raised from the dead how do you do it because as much as you think about the gospel your heart when your heart your heart will testify against the very thing that you're speaking remember when Jesus when they when the disciples were not washed in their hands before they eat and the and the Pharisees were saying you know why don't you guys wash your hands you know and all that and and he says that which you goes into your belly doesn't defile the man however remember the scripture but the things that come out of your heart that's what defiles the man and when a man is defiled how can he go to heaven how can be be sealed with the Holy Ghost amen for out of the heart comes Lies murders adulteries well how did they get in there a man they got in there by the fall and you didn't allow the Lord Jesus to come deliver you and heal you remember he said I'm standing there to heal them but because they don't have ears to hear they don't have eyes to see and they do not understand that I am he they do I understand who I am therefore I am standing here to heal them but they will never be healed even Christ is here to heal our hearts amen to deliver them but but if you won't if you won't submit yourself to them remember this this isn't you can't go halfway with this amen you know we've we've all or we're all in the hot seat now we've all we're all standing here now we all have our decision to make what we're going to do is Our Lives we have the promise of an everlasting kingdom that the creator of the heavens and the earth said I am go to prepare a place for you and if I prepare a place for you I will come again and I'll receive you unto myself but what is it tank he says go so it's you have give to the poor then you'll have treasure in heaven then come and follow me oh yeah we won't follow him amen Zechariah says behold the half that I have I give to the poor and and you know if I have robbed anybody I will restore back fourfold and Jesus said Behold salvation has come to this house sustained why because Zacharias heart have been turned over to the Lord Jesus Christ amen but when you turn your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ then you begin to love the things that he loves a mint you begin to hate the things that he hates amen it's not a burden for you to follow the scriptures if you find something in your heart that is contrary to the scriptures you go to your the throne room and you ask your Savior to heal you of that and he will deliver you but if your heart is hardened you go year after year after year knowing that without what you're doing is contrary to the word but not taking care of the problem you sir your heart is hardened how can you be saved when your heart is contrary to the scriptures and you and you're walking in that living in that how can you be saved the very word that you say you say oh I believe within my heart the word Christ that Jesus Christ was the son of God how no no this we say this verse here in Romans chapter 9 is a very very simple verse Romans chapter 10 let's read that again it says Romans chapter 10 verse 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved I think we all want to be saved don't we amen but if you in your heart are rejecting part of the word how can you out of the same heart say I have received the word and you and you and we think we can pick and choose all I'm going to obey this scripture but I'm not going to obey this one I don't want to do this I don't want to do that and you're saying that you are a Christian you say that you are believing with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is the son of God so that you can be saved your own heart is testifying against you because from your heart you're not obeying the gospel I don't care how much you can debate the word how much you can talk about it how much you can think you might be smarter than everybody in this room you might be able to put down anybody in this room by the your intelligence even Judas was able to preach the gospel and heal the sick but Satan was able to enter into his heart now look he had three and a half years to allow Christ into his heart he wouldn't do it after three and a half years he would not let Christ into his heart but then Satan came and Satan just enters right in and Satan entered into his heart to betray the Lord Jesus amen and you look at people you think how could they do this how could they do that because even though they said they'd given their heart to the Lord Jesus their own testimony the end bears out what was from the beginning and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved because if you really believe that God raised the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead it'll change the way you live it'll change the way you think it'll create a little crevasse and that stony plate of your heart where that word can finally get in there amen and as your heart burns within you he'll begin to removing those stones and do the heart surgery that needs to happen and you'll come down and by yourself before the word of God and you were James said purify your hearts you double-minded amen why because they were double minded they thought they could do this over here while still receiving the gospel over here they needed to procure off' i their hearts hey man i want to go back to you know let's go let's go back over to Genesis this is chapter 3 brother Brennan said at one point he says now if you are sitting here and you're saying you believe but you don't really believe you need to you need to stop it you know if you if you are thinking one thing and saying another you're not right you know why because that what you're saying doesn't mean anything but if your heart wherever your heart is that's where the problem lies amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 4 as the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and as pleasant to the eyes a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did he and eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked amen Satan found a way to enter in through their eyes and through their ears but God is saying if you'll hear me if you're a I see if you're a if your eyes are closed your heart is dull of hearing you cannot receive then you will receive the if you reject Christ you will receive the other amen amen and you know it's a danger I'm just saying this to illustrate how dangerous it is to come to church and to sit on the fence amen when you if you do not soften your heart Christ cannot get into you amen and order to soften your heart you have to you have to do it on your knees that's the only way around it you know we you can go to church day in day out day in day out and you know I've gone and I've talked to people that used to come to this church I talked to him years later and and and they've rejected everything that they they used to know you know they used to know and be able to talk about these things that we talked about to be able to talk about the Scriptures they'll talk about the message amen now you go talk to them they don't remember a single thing about it and it always amazes me because they'll go and they'll say something in exposes that every single thing they heard for the years and years and years that they sent here and this room has now been taken away from them why because it didn't enter into their heart their into their memory amen they might have clung to it with their things but when the riches and the cares of this life amen they choked the word out they never bear fruit of it amen and then what the end of that man is worse than the beginning hey man that's why we have to have a soft heart you know as I said we all heard in Sunday school if you receive Christ into your heart you'll be saved amen the way to be saved is to receive Christ into your heart but don't you realize that true that caught the only way to do that is through a full surrender if you do not have a full surrender Christ will never come into your heart it just won't happen amen how can you say that we're living in Bible days how can you say believe you believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever how can you say that you believe this message when you're more interested in the things of the world and you are the things of Christ let me tell you your heart is hardened if you can come and sit in this church and not give up your life for Christ your heart has been hardened you do not know where you are standing Amen you might think beware when you think that you stand lest you fall because if you do fall how can you ever get back up again amen first Corinthians 4:5 says therefore judged nothing before the time until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness I will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then every man shall have praise with God because every man in his heart is testifying one thing no matter what his word says he says well you know I I don't mind going to church I don't mind being active in the church I don't mind I don't mind singing the songs but I really don't want to give my life over to Christ Christ is coming and he's going to show off that very thought that you had in your heart hey man I know what's going to happen when that thought of your heart is exposed that's Judgment Day amen what you wouldn't let Christ into your heart why because you would not give up for your entire life for Christ amen we have to forsake all if we really want the inheritance we have to forsake all amen this this this ninety nine and a half one do this life calls for forsaking all a men I mean you only think about Jesus Christ three and a half years he walked with his disciples he dies he rises again and he still has to go up to those disciples and says o fools and slow of heart to believe all your understanding is still darkened you don't yet realize Who I am you don't yet realize that the very god this preached you day-in day-out is me I am that God you didn't realize that when you walk through that curtain into the service that God was gonna be speaking to you you didn't realize that when you were talking to your brother or your sister that you were talking to the redeemed with the Lord Jesus Christ you didn't realize you were talking to the body of the Lord Jesus Christ you didn't when you when you decided in your heart that I am NOT going to obey the gospel that you're giving away your salvation the same way Esau gave away his birthright and you think oh how could I so I don't think about that remember Esau had the birthright amen he was the firstborn he gave up his birthright for something of this world he gave up his inheritance and the Bible says that even though he sought after it with tears of repentance he could not get that back why because he gave up his birthright for just a just some food because he was hungry a man and people this day will give up give up salvation will not say well you know I'm just gonna give up now there's this one little thing over here I just don't want to give that up and they'll sit there and they think that they can sit on the fence and still receive any blessing for Christ let me tell you you can't I'll do it your heart is not right before God amen amen let's let's see let's turn over to Acts I want to show you an example of that it's a lot of scriptures but Acts chapter 8 verse 12 says but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done amen so right now at this point Simon is a believer he is going to church he is following if he's following Philip everywhere he goes he's watching the signs of miracles being done amen and he says he enjoys it he loves it he and there's a space of time here where he is following the gospel amen verse 14 now in the disciples which went now in the disciples which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost oh now we're coming to Pentecost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost Pentecost has arrived on the seat amen and what way Pentecost do it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost was coming upon hearts that had been prepared and ready to receive Christ and now son Christ was inside their hearts he was sealed and they became a part of the body of Christ amen now Christ was walking on the earth again in this body of believers in Samaria and now it's not just the sign does wonders that are being done by Philip but now there's an entire body of believers Jesus Christ has returned to the earth again amen they've been filled with the Holy Ghost they why because their hearts were ready and prepared but poor Simon here and when Simon saw what he did he saw it why'd he see it you on the outside looking in now think about it all of a sudden he was on the outside looking in all this time he thought he was in with the church but now a sudden the Holy Ghost has fallen and now suddenly finds himself on the outside looking in the Holy Spirit came by came sweeping through the town and filled those that were ready so he wasn't and he finds himself on the outside looking in and when Simon saw that through the laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost now remember this man has been baptized he said he was a believer he took upon himself the name of Lord Jesus Christ but his heart was hard as a stone he had all of this in his memory but he wouldn't submit himself to the Lord Jesus Christ and when the Holy Ghost came through the town the Holy Ghost couldn't see him and then Peters but Peter said unto Him thy money perish with thee because thou has thought where do you think it in his heart that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou hast neither part nor a lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart might be forgiven thee before I proceed that thou are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity now wait a second he was baptized he been going to church he was in the revival but because he was holding these things in his heart when the Holy Spirit came through the town don't you realize that every time a body of believers gets together and every time a body believers had that road to emmaus experience Amen where we have the powerful messages where the God is coming down your ears are being tickled the word is going down to your heart you feel your heart burning within you don't you realize what is he doing he's preparing that that body of believers he's preparing them for an upcoming print cost because every church has to have a refreshing now and again every church has to have a pentecostal once in a while every church has to have another baptism of the Holy Ghost another sweep of the Holy Ghost another or a Bible why because otherwise the church will melt away in Diamont but the church has to have another time of a refreshing amen so what does God do knowing that time of refreshing is coming amen he comes and he prepares the hearts in advance he gives them warnings to get their heart clean to get their heart ready submit yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ give up this foolishness get yourself make yourself clean and get ready because the gospel is coming get ready because Christ is coming and when and when God has done enough when he's preach the gospel when he's tickled the ears well he's prepared the hearts and people have repented and they've repented of the foolish that they allowed in their hearts then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit comes sweeping through the church for a refilling of the Holy Ghost and some will be sealed on the inside but others will find themselves on the outside looking in now why do they find because just like Simon here they allowed some wickedness to stay within their heart though they were baptized so they follow the message so all that but because of that which they left in their heart that little thing that the holy spirit could not penetrate and then I remember the Holy Spirit doesn't bring the revival every day amen not in a church wide experience but if you need a revival get your heart ready amen if you're not where you ought to be in Christ get your heart ready why because the Holy Spirit is coming amen and he will he will revive those that can be revived but if your heart is not ready then how can you be revived but Peter said unto Him thy money perish with thee because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased as money thou has neither part nor lot in this manner for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps maybe the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for I perceive that thou are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity think about the time when the when the woman had the alabaster box and she realized that Jesus was sitting there with unwashed feet and so she went and she gave up everything she had to go and purchase that alabaster box she gave up all and she went in and she she gave up her pride she gave up her money she gave up everything to go in to Jesus into Simon's house tu-tu-tu-tu-tu with the alabaster box to worship before Jesus and she went there and she realized he hadn't been anointed with oil he hadn't been washed with his feet amen heal well he wasn't being taken care of amen and so what'd she do she goes in there and she begins to brew she breaks the seal open amen and and when that and when when she begins to worship Lord Jesus Christ there was all sudden two people in that room they were in the midst of a worship service now everybody was in the midst of the worship service but two are on the inside and the rest were sealed out why were they sealed out because they had not prepared beforehand to give up everything that they had to worship Christ there was only one person in that room was gonna give up everything to worship Christ the way he deserved be worshipped and she was the one that's on the inside of the worship service amen everybody else was sit that they could look at it with your eyes but they couldn't experience it in their heart amen and so is the same thing happen every Sunday every Wednesday every every morning we have a chance an opportunity to worship the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus himself said only the pure in heart shall see God amen or else where will they see they'll see judgment amen but the pure at heart will see God amen and they will worship Him amen we're almost closing here let's just turn over to well turn to 2nd Corinthians and we'll go to Hebrews 3 2nd corinthians 3 3 second Corinthians 3:3 says for as much as your manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of heart amen if Christ is ever gonna get his word into you he's gonna get his word into a fleshly heart they meant he's not if your heart is a heart of stone he is not gonna place his word into you amen now the word is that's what's coming again to save us but you're if you're if the word if your heart is not prepared you the word cannot come now let's go to Hebrews three so the Holy Spirit is here to what to write his word in our hearts and if the heart is not ready it cannot come to pass Hebrews 3 verse 8 verse 7 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the temptation in the day of the wilderness when your hearts tempted me and proved me they saw my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swore in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest why because they're always erring in their heart a mint may they say one thing but in their heart they believe something else amen their own heart is testifying against them Amen because as Jesus said it's not the things that come out they go into a man that defile man but it's the things that come out of your heart for with your heart your soul is speaking amen and just as in closing here you know he came to heal our hearts but if we won't be healed the week this this this walk this gospel the man's a complete surrender a man if you have something that you are holding back you're in grave danger of having a hardened heart that can never be softened again why because when Christ came you pulled yourself back and you harden your heart and he said I will not listen to what the word said the word came you wouldn't listen to it how can you expect that the Holy Ghost will ever come across your path again sometimes we think that a little these little sins and things are so innocent and you don't realize that the devil was going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour amen and he will enter into the hearts that are not sealed by the Holy Ghost you can be baptized you can rejoice you can do all those things oh and you're holding things back from and not giving Christ the hon 100% and you're holding things back in your life and to not submit yourself to the gospel to not submit yourself to the word that's being preached how can you say that you have an inheritance in heaven when the very word that came to bring you to heaven you reject it amen let's just an amen let's just bow our heads a word of Prayer heavenly father we just pray unto you lord or a sobering message father lord I even pray for my own self father if my heart is hardened in any way Lord if anybody here in this room is hard in their heart through the deceitfulness of iniquity lord I pray you would give a space Lord to repent father to forgive us Lord Lord sometimes we do things and we don't realize how serious the thing is that we're doing when we allow sin to reign in our hearts father Lord forgive us Lord for if we have rejected your word Lord or for you brought your word unto this tabernacle father Lord you you laid out the table for us where the saints of God are fed you say come and eat where your hearts can be fed but Lord if we refuse Oh Lord forgive us father for surely lor if we've hardened our hearts Lord forgive us Lord if we could find space to repent Lord forgive us Lord fluor we we in so many ways Lord we offend in so many ways it's so easy in this Laodicean age to begin to have the cares of this world to enter in but Lord we want to keep the fervency of the gospel within our hearts Lord to not let these little foxes that spoil the vine the little things that that we we're hearing the thread of the devil and not rebuking it Lord or to be letting our eyes look upon the things that the devil brings to us Lord and and and not rejecting it Lord forgive us or when we allow thoughts to rise in our hearts so we know are not right and yet we don't take care of it Lord forgive us father when we hear the word that says we ought to do this and then we just never seem to get around to doing that Lord forgive us father Lord you brought your word we want to say yes and amen to it or we know that you're coming too soon father we don't know how many times your Holy Spirit will bring the refreshing below when you're refreshing does come Lord we want our heart to be ready so we don't find ourselves on the outside looking in like Simon Lord or like Judas floor please father forgive us Lord of all of our foolishness and our iniquity the gall of bitterness and the deceitfulness of riches and iniquity Lord forgive us father we want to give up a hundred percent Lord you though we might be real Christians in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray have mercy upon us Lord and forgive us of our sins and all of our iniquities in the name of Jesus Christ we pray let it be done amen brother Isaac if you come a manaphy my desires prayer amen you know and God when God brings a message he always lays out a path for that message to be received Amen if God ever speaks anything from behind this pulpit he has a way for you to receive that they meant and if God has spoken to your heart in any least a little bit if your heart has been hardened and by God has somehow gotten through your eyes and your ears and has that word is landed upon your heart and you've been given an opportunity right now to either soften your heart or harden your heart and that choice lays before every single one of us amen now if we have things in our lives that we know are not right we know that those things are contrary to the gospel that has been preached then we know that right now God is laying a path a door is open right before us to repent what an opportunity what a chance what an opportunity that we could repent of our sins and be forgiven of our sins what a blessing we had Simon hardened his heart and found himself on the outside looking in and Philip had to tell him go seek repentance find out if maybe after you've you've heard the gospel preached week after week after week after week you've been following this revival and you still haven't repented of your sins I'm looking down into your heart God has given me a vision to peer down inside your heart and I perceive the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity are still there after every service still there after every altar call it's still there and the word has come and you didn't repent and the word is coming you didn't repent and now the holy ghost has come the revival is here now people are rejoicing and you cannot enter in because your heart has been so hardened Wow Lord God have mercy on us and yet every message God gives an opportunity to accept that message a chance an opportunity that we can soften our hearts that somehow maybe just maybe we could find a way to get back to repentance because only the pure in heart can see God I say oh I want to see him you can't do it when you have your heart so hardened by holding back these sins and iniquities and not allowing Christ to massage that heart of yours again and to remove all those stony parties three and a half years Lord worked with them and he still had to come back and do another work just to get them to understand I'm here to eat the Passover with you with desire I've desired to gather you together so that you might receive the lamb for your atonement but you would not your heart still hardened yet amen oh we come into this church and we do not give up these little sins and these little things not realizing that every week our heart is getting harder and harder and harder so when the Holy Ghost comes how can we receive the revival how can we receive the rapture how can we receive these things well we won't let God do the things that he's trying to do amen if God is working on your heart this morning I challenge you to come up here they meant make a sign of repentance for God with every message gives an open door to receive that sign amen amen if God is working on your heart then come on the ark the altar is open God has a table spread with of God or faith amen and applo away an opportunity for your hardened heart who has been taking these sins to church day-in day-out taking your bag of sins into church and then taking them back with you back home the altar is open to lay that down and the name was Lord Jesus Christ amen the altar is a change my heart my heart oh go make it ever to change my heart O God may I be like you Oh change my heart O God make it ever true change my heart O God may I be like you pardon I'm the clean mold me and me this is what I pray or change my heart O God make it ever true change my heart O God may I be like Oh change my heart O God make it ever true change my heart O may our be like mold me and me this is what I [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] me and me this is what I pray hallelujah whoa that I
