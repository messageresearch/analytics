[0:11] our house they come and transform lives
[0:14] and come and give hope to the hopeless
[0:16] in the name of Jesus Lord every power

[0:24] such a spirit or I come against it by
[0:29] the authority in the name of Jesus hey
[0:32] Deborah we are cure you this morning
[0:34] flee lose you of the people of God and
[0:38] let them be free in Christ this morning
[0:40] this we ask in a matchless name of our
[0:43] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[0:46] let's open our Bibles to John chapter 16
[0:49] wanna read from two places in Scripture
[0:52] this morning let's read John 16 and
[0:56] let's pick two verses from John 16 I
[1:03] hope my Bible doesn't stick together
[1:05] this morning this was the very scripture
[1:07] a prophet was reading and his pages
[1:10] stuck together hallelujah I hope mine
[1:13] doesn't happen that way this morning of
[1:14] course it will not happen because his
[1:20] ministry was a special ministry verse 21
[1:22] and 22
[1:23] I read aware of God a woman when she is
[1:32] in travail have sorrow because hour has
[1:38] come but as soon as she's delivered of
[1:42] the child she remembered no more the
[1:45] anguish for joy that a man is born into
[1:49] the world and you know deaf he now
[1:54] therefore have sorrow but I will I will
[1:58] see you again and your heart shall
[2:01] rejoice and your joy
[2:03] no man ticket from you will await anyone
[2:08] who is sorrowful this morning hallelujah
[2:11] Jesus is saying that he's going to give
[2:14] you joy that no man can't
[2:16] hallelujah let's flip our Bibles back to
[2:19] Luke chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 and let's
[2:25] see whether we can tie these two
[2:27] scriptures together this morning Luke
[2:34] chapter 4 I read verse 16 to 21 the
[2:38] first time at the beginning of the
[2:44] miniature Jesus Christ let me put it
[2:45] that way I read a Word of God and he
[2:47] came to Nazareth where he had been
[2:50] brought up and as his custom was he went
[2:53] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[2:55] and stood up for to read and there was
[3:00] delivered unto Him the book of the
[3:02] Prophet Esaias and when he had opened
[3:05] the book he found a place where it was
[3:08] written the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[3:12] me because he has anointed me to preach
[3:16] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[3:19] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[3:22] deliverance to the captives and
[3:24] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[3:27] at liberty them that are bruised to
[3:31] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[3:33] now watch and he closed the book and he
[3:37] gave it again to the minister and sat
[3:40] down and the eyes of all them that way
[3:42] in the Snuggle were fastened on him and
[3:44] he began to say unto them this day this
[3:49] scripture fulfilled in your this day is
[3:54] this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[3:58] hallelujah shall we pray Heavenly Father
[4:02] may you bless the reading of your word
[4:04] in Jesus name we pray amen
[4:06] let's be seated
[4:09] hallelujah amen I can send some down s
[4:17] in you this morning it meant some
[4:19] somebodies hallelujah
[4:21] I let the name of Jesus excited this
[4:23] morning
[4:24] it meant mini-moon Jesus I want to title
[4:35] my sermon this morning the manifesto of
[4:39] Malachi 4:5 and cysts
[4:43] the manifesto of malachi four five and
[4:46] six
[4:47] I know the word manifesto is not aware
[4:51] that is very commonly used here in
[4:54] America in fact I've never had it in
[4:56] public discuss but it's a very common
[4:59] word when you come to our part of the
[5:01] world when anytime they are a selection
[5:04] political parties come up with you have
[5:07] various manifestos in all hours a public
[5:10] declaration of what they want to do when
[5:13] they gain power
[5:15] hallelujah so the scripture that we read
[5:20] in Luke chapter 4 was the public
[5:24] declaration of our Lord Jesus Christ
[5:27] about his mission why he came
[5:33] hallelujah so look for from the 16 to 21
[5:40] Jesus was quoting the scriptures as
[5:44] written by the prophet Isaiah so look
[5:49] for 16 to 21 Jesus was caught in Isaiah
[5:53] chapter 61 that's one and king but you
[5:59] realize that he didn't codes there's two
[6:02] completely he stopped in the middle of
[6:05] his two we'll come back to that but just
[6:09] to give you the background so this was
[6:12] the first public declaration of why he
[6:16] had come amen and when or if in this end
[6:25] time according to the promise of the
[6:28] scriptures somebody is going to come
[6:31] back in that Ministry of Christ then we
[6:38] ought to also understand what is the
[6:41] public declaration of his ministry why
[6:44] he at them so that is what I want to
[6:47] talk about this morning right breviary
[6:51] God is
[6:57] he said he's the greatest artist I mean
[7:00] when he writes his place
[7:02] they play off so beautiful his drama is
[7:07] always perfect yesterday when I was
[7:12] reading this scripture I was wondering
[7:14] that God used almost thousand five
[7:19] hundred years to manifest to the Jewish
[7:23] people
[7:24] first Moses when he came out of Egypt
[7:27] then along the line Elijah came then the
[7:33] chief the prophet the God prophet came
[7:38] in the person of Jesus Christ and I was
[7:43] asking myself what he took thousand five
[7:46] hundred years to do among the Jewish
[7:48] people within a period of less than 20
[7:51] years he accomplished it among the
[7:53] Gentiles he put all these three gifts
[7:57] all these three ministries of major
[7:59] Jewish prophets into one ministry I mean
[8:04] that's it's so amazing I don't know
[8:07] whether you are you are you are with me
[8:08] in what I'm talking about talking about
[8:10] I'm saying that for the Jewish people
[8:17] first when he came out of Egypt they
[8:20] were led by prophet called Moses Joshua
[8:24] took over jgies came in some well came
[8:28] in then along the line another mighty
[8:31] prophet came Elijah then as they went
[8:36] along the Elijah ministry repeated again
[8:39] in John the Baptist followed by Christ
[8:42] himself
[8:43] amen God made flesh and dwelt among us
[8:49] amen then according to the scriptures
[8:52] according to Luke 1730
[8:54] according to Malachi verse four five and
[8:57] six
[8:58] according to so many other scriptures
[9:01] in this end time God is going to send
[9:07] again another prophet God is going to
[9:12] send a game a prophet not to the Jewish
[9:15] people back to we resent us and now when
[9:19] this prophet came amen
[9:23] the Ministry of Moses the Minister of
[9:26] Elijah the Ministry of Christ something
[9:28] that he took thousand five hundred years
[9:29] to do was all embedded in that one man
[9:34] and that's that's amazing
[9:37] I mean it's so amazing amen so brethren
[9:43] the scripture we read in Luke as I said
[9:47] earlier talks about Christ as public
[9:50] proclamation of his ministry what he had
[9:53] come to do and if you read back from
[9:58] Isaiah well I didn't just display as a
[10:01] chapter 61 verse 2 for us if you read
[10:04] back from Isaiah you realize that if he
[10:10] had gone beyond the middle of verse 1 to
[10:14] verse 2 you have been talking about any
[10:16] time because his first coming is not
[10:21] about vengeance his first coming was
[10:25] about
[10:29] proclaiming the jubilee of the Lord
[10:32] uh I mean you'll have your Bibles I
[10:34] system if you don't have Bibles but
[10:37] those of you have your bike your Bibles
[10:38] as a sexy one person versus it to
[10:43] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[10:45] you see in Isaiah the verse to come ends
[10:48] by saying and the day of vengeance of
[10:50] our God to comfort all that mourn the
[10:53] day of vengeance but Jesus left out a
[10:56] part when he has read to proclaim the
[11:01] acceptable year of our Lord he closed
[11:04] the Bible or he closed the screw and
[11:06] gave it back to the priest are you
[11:10] following the reason he closes crew we
[11:12] all know is because his first coming was
[11:15] not about the day of vengeance the day
[11:18] of vengeance is after his second coming
[11:20] so he had not come the first time to
[11:23] accomplish that part the last part of
[11:26] assassins 2 1 verse 2 so brethren that
[11:30] is why you need the Holy Spirit to read
[11:35] a scripture and understand it
[11:36] because one verse of scripture is two
[11:40] thousand years apart can you believe
[11:42] that the first part has already be
[11:44] fulfilled two thousand years ago the
[11:46] last part of the same verse is to be
[11:48] fulfilled in this endtime just one verse
[11:50] of scripture two thousand years apart
[11:53] separated by a comma you see why every
[11:57] line must be open every precept must be
[12:00] upon precept line upon line we see why
[12:02] this must dovetail you see why no false
[12:05] doctrine must be entertaining to the
[12:07] church attending the church because just
[12:10] one word wrongly placed just destroyed
[12:14] the whole chain you know what I'm saying
[12:17] right so let's continue so after reading
[12:23] he said today you're yes this scripture
[12:26] has been fulfilled
[12:28] and I said earlier that the Bible
[12:31] promise it looks a meeting today that
[12:33] the Ministry of Christ now I'm not
[12:37] saying Jesus Christ I hope you can tell
[12:42] the difference
[12:43] Amen I'm saying the Ministry of Christ
[12:48] Jesus is a human being but in that body
[12:53] the human body dwell the fullness of God
[12:59] amen right so that ministry is supposed
[13:04] to be repeated again in this end time
[13:08] amen
[13:09] and in this end time if you read first
[13:12] us alone Ian's for from verse 16 the
[13:14] Bible says that the Lord himself shall
[13:18] descend in a shout in a voice say the
[13:23] Lord Himself is going to accomplish
[13:25] three things shout voice trumpet and we
[13:31] know that the shout we know how the
[13:33] schottische Brahmas interpreted or the
[13:34] shout is for the voice if you read a
[13:37] message rapture everything is there but
[13:39] the three things the shout the voice and
[13:43] the trumpet is going to be done by the
[13:46] Lord Himself that is why you can only
[13:49] meet with ambra hands ministry to only
[13:52] the Minister of Elijah a foreigner that
[13:56] is why you cannot limit him to only the
[14:00] Ministry of John the Baptist a foreigner
[14:04] because the Ministry of Christ was also
[14:07] in him now to prove this something
[14:13] happen remember William Rambo's
[14:15] preaching the this message January 1965
[14:20] birth pains
[14:23] now when Rob Ramos missing birthdays he
[14:28] wanted to read John chapter 16 as we we
[14:32] read this morning verse 20 21 and 22 a
[14:35] woman in travail so way he opens to John
[14:41] all right I think he when he begins to
[14:43] really sees that no that's no way he's
[14:46] not reading the right scripture and
[14:49] Abraham concluded that there was a
[14:52] misprint because that is not the Bible
[14:54] that he normally uses it you remember it
[14:56] was in January and in December the wife
[14:59] had bought that new Bible for him as a
[15:02] Christmas present and he was trying to
[15:04] read from the new Bible so unknowing to
[15:08] brother Brahim two pages were stuck
[15:10] together
[15:10] he couldn't separate the two pages but
[15:12] he thought it was a misprint so he was
[15:15] struggling to find a scripture he called
[15:17] on other brothers to help him then watch
[15:21] something happened which some of you
[15:24] yourself you might have had before what
[15:26] happened was there was a Catholic
[15:28] priests bishops Stanley was sitting
[15:32] there then the Spirit of the Lord came
[15:36] upon the bishop and I mean I'm on
[15:40] Pentecostals and I'm on end time
[15:42] believers when we talk about a spirit or
[15:44] a lord coming up on a Catholic priest
[15:45] will be skeptical but come on who was
[15:51] cavas confess was a priest in Israel and
[15:54] the Spirit of the Lord came upon confess
[15:57] and he promised Sarah what they need for
[15:59] them to one man should die for the
[16:01] people about he prophesied about Jesus
[16:03] Christ's death so girls spirit can come
[16:06] upon anybody even God opened a mouth of
[16:10] an animal a donkey to speak to a human
[16:14] being
[16:14] amen that is why we preach in this check
[16:18] that girl's spirit coming up on somebody
[16:20] for the presence of speaking tones has
[16:23] nothing to do with the person having the
[16:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost the two are
[16:29] all related God's anointing generally
[16:33] anointing can come upon you today
[16:36] a you do something that God wants you to
[16:38] do and that's the end of it it has
[16:40] nothing to do with whether you are born
[16:42] again or you have the Holy Spirit or
[16:44] anything like that it has nothing to do
[16:46] with it
[16:48] so yeah so God's anointing those power
[16:53] came upon this Catholic priest he got up
[16:55] took his Bible and gave it to problem
[16:58] for Barbra Hamm to read those of you who
[17:00] have to take I mean now it's online you
[17:02] can download a table and plate on your I
[17:04] mean if you instead of watching all
[17:06] these filthy videos on your mobile phone
[17:07] you'll be better off clean some of these
[17:10] tips to come in to lift up your spirit
[17:13] hallelujah
[17:14] so you can go back home and play a bath
[17:16] pain is there you can hear Bishop
[17:18] Stanley's voice clear on the tip was
[17:20] recorded Brendan I tell you that tape
[17:22] recorder was manufactured because was
[17:25] developed or was invented because of
[17:27] this message so everything has been
[17:29] stored for us nobody can dispute it so
[17:33] every shower Stanley got up and came to
[17:34] the poopies he said to Barbara hum to
[17:37] take it easy but this is being done for
[17:39] a purpose and go to reveal to him why it
[17:41] is being done can you imagine a Catholic
[17:44] priest sitting and the under and for a
[17:47] pentacle star to preach to him and he
[17:48] getting up and saying this so the
[17:52] following day this thing was happy in
[17:54] Arizona phonics so the following day
[17:57] LeBron came and preached the same on
[18:00] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[18:03] which was an interpretation of what
[18:06] happened the previous day will be
[18:08] substantial that's a very short message
[18:09] you can play the tomb two teams and you
[18:12] will get an understanding of what I'm
[18:13] trying to say I you with me very
[18:18] we have irrefutable proof that God has
[18:22] been merciful has visited us again this
[18:25] year now if we reject it we are
[18:28] regretting it to our own destruction
[18:31] hallelujah I said if we reject it we are
[18:34] rejecting it to our own destruction
[18:37] God's truth has been pretty to us amen
[18:42] so I'm saying that if in the first
[18:45] coming if when Christ came the first
[18:50] time amen
[18:53] or in the first public display of the
[18:55] Christ's ministry amen
[18:58] a priest handed the scroll to him for
[19:03] him to declare what his public
[19:06] ministries
[19:07] why he had come then in this end time it
[19:11] does say Ministry of Christ is to be
[19:13] repeated and a priest gave that minister
[19:18] a Bible to read from there it behooves
[19:22] on us followers of the message to go
[19:24] back and pay attention to the message he
[19:27] preached on that day when this Bravo was
[19:29] handed over to him because in that
[19:31] message lies the secret of his coming
[19:35] church are you four are you following
[19:37] what I'm preaching because it's not
[19:40] enough to know the history of the
[19:42] message it's not enough if you cannot
[19:44] take the message simple plain message is
[19:48] good but if you cannot take the message
[19:49] and get these revelations and bring them
[19:51] out of the message the message is not
[19:53] going to benefit you because remember
[19:55] that the letter killeth is a spirit that
[19:58] gives life just knowing the letter of
[20:01] the message it's just like all these
[20:03] bishops that we have in a world where b2
[20:04] geological school they all know the
[20:07] letter of the Bible they can't cut it I
[20:09] know this one
[20:10] bishop in my country producing a child
[20:14] called lighthouse edge he has a special
[20:16] gift he'd never reached from the Bible
[20:19] you hold your Bibles and when he
[20:21] mentions the scripture he will coated
[20:24] wetware you caught from youth say ting
[20:27] ting generation read it in a NIV read it
[20:32] in some other vision every portion of
[20:34] Scripture that's what he does and if you
[20:36] want to follow him you'll be confused
[20:39] that is a gift that God has given to him
[20:42] but he has but you see so your ability
[20:44] to
[20:45] read your ability to know geologically
[20:48] know the Bible from Genesis 1:1 to
[20:50] revelation 20:2 brother/sister it has
[20:56] nothing to do with you understanding of
[20:58] the way now if it was so poor would he
[21:02] have missed the coming of the Lord
[21:05] remember Apostle Paul but at the time he
[21:08] was called so he was highly educated
[21:12] highly highly educated as some of us are
[21:18] trying to do now still in school at this
[21:20] age trying to get degrees
[21:22] I wish we didn't have to do it my frame
[21:30] is day it's it's a vet veterinary doctor
[21:33] but he still still looking for more
[21:36] decreases come here to come and look for
[21:38] to come acquire more knowledge
[21:40] I'm also here where childhood classmates
[21:46] so it's I don't know for me I've always
[21:50] told myself that if it was not a
[21:51] requirement from my employers that I
[21:53] should go back to school and get a PhD I
[21:55] I would never have gone back to screw up
[21:56] satisfy what I know why because they
[21:59] require me that is why I came back to
[22:00] school I'm not saying this to discourage
[22:04] if you want to educate yourself but
[22:06] don't let that education take away God's
[22:09] Word from your heart I mean your
[22:11] education is very useless if it will
[22:13] take how it goes away from your heart so
[22:18] Paul was highly educated but when Jesus
[22:20] Christ came he missed it he was
[22:24] persecuting the disciples of Jesus
[22:26] Christ tossing them in prison
[22:29] supervising the execution mean you know
[22:34] the scheme
[22:35] just about that all the limit people in
[22:39] Israel from gamellia to cave fast
[22:43] all these highly landed that's why the
[22:44] Bible call some of the scribes the
[22:46] Pharisees and remember these people were
[22:51] not I don't worship s they were
[22:55] worshipping the god of Moses they were
[22:59] doing what God asked them to do and they
[23:01] were insisting on doing that yet they
[23:04] miss that coming of the Lord
[23:06] you see how easy this it's so easy for
[23:10] you to miss the coming of the Lord as
[23:13] many many many who call themselves
[23:15] bishops and apostles and prophets and
[23:18] whatnot in this world today are going to
[23:21] miss his car there every misses coming
[23:23] already when he came down in 1963 they
[23:28] miss it even though it was written all
[23:30] over the skies it was photographed and
[23:34] sent across the world but he missed it
[23:37] they missed him in the Houston Coliseum
[23:39] in 1950 when he allowed himself to be
[23:43] photographed they missed him
[23:44] they brought their hosts and
[23:46] photographers there to come and take
[23:47] pictures to make mockery of it you know
[23:50] the history when it is so easy only a
[23:56] few people amen
[24:00] before the preaching of marriage and
[24:02] divorce when he came down on the
[24:03] mountain in in Arizona missed him when
[24:07] there were a few people who said we knew
[24:09] Rhonda you a day when they saw that
[24:12] cloud that I'm Lamba Clarke going up and
[24:15] down the mountain some people knew that
[24:17] he was there when Christ was born some
[24:19] people knew the president no but an
[24:23] angel visited shepherds they were
[24:24] watching their flocks by night and told
[24:26] them that Christ the Savior is born
[24:29] three wise men from the east were told
[24:31] they saw the scientists eye that the
[24:34] king or the Jewish people had been born
[24:37] and they traveled two years were
[24:39] worshiping but the Leonard people who
[24:42] their holy people the people who are
[24:43] supposed to know the truth they were
[24:45] sitting in Jerusalem they knew nothing
[24:50] Semien the old man in the temple he knew
[24:53] Ana exeat s oh she knew some people new
[24:58] by the majority of the people knew
[24:59] nothing about it
[25:01] beloved when brother Brown was preaching
[25:04] the seals he says something and I'm not
[25:07] gonna talk in it say anything about that
[25:08] now maybe one day I'll see something
[25:11] about it
[25:11] no no maybe one day I'll go to a VA I'll
[25:14] return to Africa and come back here and
[25:16] come and see something about it because
[25:19] there has to be a time to say everything
[25:21] Quran says something is happening here
[25:24] in the room now but there is no way you
[25:27] can know anything about it what is he
[25:31] that happened at the opinion disease
[25:32] what was the event or the opening of the
[25:35] scene sills
[25:37] many miss it evening those who wear it
[25:39] was the closest friends of with Abraham
[25:41] mystique look damn man that two closest
[25:47] people who went around the world
[25:48] preaching bra bra wear got a nice day
[25:50] and Jack Moore kondal is this book that
[25:55] he wrote he said God said the prophecy
[26:00] that came on hi everybody 1983 said that
[26:02] I'm semi you and others like you to
[26:07] prepare the people for the coming of the
[26:08] Lord
[26:09] come on God never sent out a group of
[26:12] people core doesn't do that if he does
[26:15] that'll be confusing he always uses one
[26:18] man at a time and through that one man's
[26:22] ministry expressed to others I you with
[26:27] me so beloved it's very easy for me to
[26:31] miss God God I move on the same finish
[26:34] his way can leave the same you miss him
[26:37] that's happened people are going to miss
[26:40] the rats at the same way life will
[26:42] continue as usual how many people
[26:47] disappear every day from this world even
[26:48] America a law in Iowa here it's only
[26:52] it's only the disappearance of was it
[26:54] the lady that was killed recently mainly
[26:59] them only that's the only one that we
[27:00] had but the way others that disappear
[27:03] like her but those were not as
[27:05] publicized our hairs it depends on the
[27:08] resources that you have to publicize
[27:11] when you you know some alive one
[27:13] disappears so many people disappear
[27:14] every day so many people are kidnap
[27:16] everyday and we don't hear so if one in
[27:20] a million you disappear one do you think
[27:21] someone is going to bother nobody's
[27:23] going to bother so rarely it's very easy
[27:28] to miss the plan of God so that's what
[27:30] I'm saying that put on your thinking cap
[27:32] put on your cups of prophecy and listen
[27:34] to what I'm trying to say this I may not
[27:36] say everything exactly the way I should
[27:38] say it but if you have revelation what I
[27:41] say today will bring forth a desire in
[27:46] you to search to find out what is
[27:49] brother from Ghana talking about so
[27:57] Bradley what I'm trying to say is that
[27:59] when when Abraham came and that thing
[28:02] took place between he and Brad Stanley
[28:04] in Phoenix Arizona it was not just
[28:08] something ordinary that took place it
[28:11] happened for a peppers and I'm not the
[28:13] one saying that brahbrah himself told us
[28:15] that before he died that nothing
[28:17] happened for peppers that's why he
[28:19] preached a message this day is the
[28:21] scripture fulfilled and if we take that
[28:25] mess a try really look look at the
[28:28] paragraph 43 very carefully and I prayed
[28:32] I go reveal something to your heart
[28:33] email but is what I want to say this
[28:37] morning in this last days when Barbra
[28:49] Hamm preached he was preaching about bad
[28:58] things I'm struggling so how to put this
[29:02] in so that you get me he was fishing
[29:05] about birth pains and he was he read
[29:11] about a woman when she's in travail
[29:18] beloved what I want to say this morning
[29:22] is this that we were all born wrong in a
[29:31] man the only person who was born correct
[29:35] was Jesus Christ because he was not born
[29:40] by a woman in a womb a union between a
[29:43] man and a woman he was very important to
[29:48] us
[29:50] Adam was a spoken word seed of God Jesus
[29:55] Christ
[29:56] spoken word seed of God and because they
[30:01] were born right they could not see Jesus
[30:07] Christ was born right so he could not
[30:09] see I are you getting what I'm saying
[30:15] but because we were born wrong we were
[30:18] born of an evil nietzsche my brother my
[30:23] sister the first time you told lies
[30:24] nobody taught you how to tell lies
[30:26] that's how you were born nobody catches
[30:34] a young man or a young woman put him in
[30:36] a room and teaching or her how to
[30:38] fornicate
[30:39] it's him born it's the evil nature with
[30:42] which you were born nobody teaches you
[30:46] how to steal the reason why all this
[30:53] evil is associated with man is the best
[30:55] by which we came so brethren and the
[31:02] core of this message now when Abraham
[31:07] came to give us it's Beth this is what
[31:14] I'm trying to say at the core the heart
[31:18] of this message because the message he
[31:20] was preaching that day he died he
[31:22] preached the day that a priest gave this
[31:25] to this Bible to him is Beth now how do
[31:32] we change our nature from this evil Beth
[31:36] this hard which in this evil nature to a
[31:38] godly nature or how does our nature
[31:41] change from an evil nature to a godly
[31:44] nature and Jesus gave the answer that
[31:49] that change of nature can only come if
[31:53] you attain a new best only new best and
[32:01] do it nothing else can do it says how
[32:06] you fall
[32:06] we only knew best if without new bet you
[32:09] can't change you can't have a change
[32:12] nature you continue your old ways you
[32:17] continue you are dull chill adulterous
[32:19] life you continue your fornication life
[32:22] you continue in your stealing and lying
[32:25] and all these things that we all know
[32:28] are no good to the extent that now the
[32:33] world has accepted all this is right
[32:39] even that this is the this is the way
[32:42] God made me so you have to accept me
[32:44] that way
[32:44] no you are done we're because of your
[32:49] wrong Beth very anything that you are
[32:55] struggling with this day as why hearing
[32:58] my voice is because of your wrong Beth
[33:01] if you can't live right for Christ amen
[33:06] if you cannot live about sin know that
[33:09] it is because of your own death you must
[33:12] reveal in prayer to be given I mean to
[33:17] be born again let me put it away it's
[33:21] our own babe that is causing that all
[33:25] the fighting the fasting I mean all
[33:29] these wars in the world is our own death
[33:33] all the madmen we are electing as
[33:36] presidents across the world it's our own
[33:38] death look God gave Israel a prophet who
[33:48] was faithful and true to them after the
[33:53] death of Moses and Joshua also left the
[33:55] scene then they never had any prophet
[33:57] they were Roubaix judges priests then
[34:01] don't give them a prophet in the person
[34:03] or somewhere someone ever did anything
[34:08] wrong he told them exactly what was
[34:11] ghost peppers what was God's plan when
[34:14] they have to fight in a war they went to
[34:16] someone's summer told them what to do
[34:17] they when they came back with victory
[34:21] and the people were not satisfied with
[34:23] it they went back to somewhere where he
[34:25] was always say hey somewhere we now need
[34:30] a key
[34:31] someone said what you need a key see if
[34:40] they were thinking right they should
[34:41] have gone to someone and said oh some of
[34:43] you are now growing old who take away
[34:46] from you how let's pray to our God who
[34:48] give us another prophet like you but I
[34:50] said no all the nations around us have
[34:53] kids so let us also have a king but see
[34:56] man is constantly making the wrong
[34:59] choices and the reason we are constantly
[35:02] making the wrong choices because our
[35:05] wrong bethe a father who has walked a
[35:09] setting ruled before a mother who has
[35:12] walked a certain road before who never
[35:14] want a child to walk the route my
[35:19] daughter this is what I did and I got
[35:23] pregnant without marriage because when
[35:27] my parents were talking to you I never
[35:28] listened I always went out I went to the
[35:30] cinema I did this and this is what I did
[35:32] and I got into trouble so don't go out
[35:33] at this time the gentleman has not
[35:37] married you so don't be going to the
[35:39] house don't go and sleep over that dad
[35:42] the father doesn't want that because
[35:45] they are they have they have the
[35:47] experience they have worked that rule
[35:49] before but the children do it anyhow you
[35:56] know listen and the reason you don't
[35:58] listen my little ones is because of your
[36:01] wrong bed and that is what Bala Brahm
[36:05] was talking about when he preached
[36:06] birthdays amen so for that wrong birth
[36:13] to change to a new type of death amen
[36:18] you have to go through pain
[36:24] sisters brothers if we don't go through
[36:26] pain that Beth cannot come you have to
[36:33] go to pay there is no secession in
[36:36] Christ Oh hallelujah
[36:40] did you get me there is no c-section
[36:43] since a caesarean session
[36:45] you know when women are about to give
[36:47] birth these days when they are having a
[36:50] difficulty they just cut them and take
[36:52] out the child we call a caesarean
[36:55] session and I'm saying that in Christ
[36:58] there is no secession secession is done
[37:00] to limit your pain and in Christ there's
[37:04] no secession you have to bear their pain
[37:09] [Music]
[37:11] now they have only kept adora they
[37:15] inject it
[37:15] you are injected see all this is no
[37:19] wonder we have yesterday I was listening
[37:21] to a report they say autism in the last
[37:23] 8 years has increased 600 percent and I
[37:28] tell you this increases are here in the
[37:31] so-called advanced parts of the world in
[37:33] our part of the world where woman has to
[37:35] give him best and are very harsh
[37:36] conditions naturally very few people are
[37:39] born with autism and Down syndrome and
[37:41] all these chromosomal we traditions that
[37:46] we have that's a fact
[37:48] oh this see God has a reason why he was
[37:54] the chicken this does a vet here I don't
[37:56] know where I he knows anything about
[37:57] chicken hatching the girl has a reason
[38:00] why he wants the chicken to hatch the
[38:02] way it hatches when that she came in the
[38:06] egg after the mother has created the
[38:09] right environment it is fragment to come
[38:12] out it to be robbing his body using the
[38:15] big to pick the shell of the of the of
[38:17] the egg wanting to come out I when I was
[38:21] a child I used to raise a lot of chicken
[38:23] in Boca my father was a poultry farmer
[38:24] nicer is chicken
[38:27] all the eggs that I tried to hatch
[38:31] myself it failed because there was no
[38:36] girls provided way for the chicken to
[38:38] hatch of course today we have incubators
[38:41] that try to hug the chicken but how do
[38:44] we produce we produce some some very
[38:48] weak this poetry's that we keep very
[38:50] weak you have to put them on antibiotics
[38:52] and medication and that's why we are all
[38:54] consuming we are now dead people get
[39:02] some all homegrown chicken and eat and
[39:05] see how the taste is so good now this
[39:09] new thing that there's bone is so soft
[39:11] you crack the bone there is no taste in
[39:13] the boot the whole thing is tasteless I
[39:16] remember when I first went to Canada and
[39:18] my wife to quit my shop I saw the grocer
[39:20] who amazed all these vegetables all I
[39:24] mean now say wow that's a big shot is a
[39:26] good one and I saw tilapia you know in
[39:29] my country trap is very popular so I saw
[39:32] tilapia very big big big I say hey it
[39:35] wrap yeah we bought that thing took it
[39:38] home when I she did that thing I quit
[39:43] the team is tasteless it's not a tilapia
[39:45] I'm used to and I was tempted to blame
[39:50] her unfortunately she's not here as our
[39:52] center to blame her head that she didn't
[39:54] cook that thing well and I mean god
[39:58] bless my wife she said kitchen woman
[39:59] she's so good at the kitchen and I like
[40:01] her for that but I think was not tasting
[40:05] good so it was little and I found out
[40:07] that because it's red is it's something
[40:12] that they produce themselves it's not
[40:14] like something that was caught from any
[40:16] natural system so it had noticed
[40:20] Gregory you may not realize this beside
[40:22] those of you were born here all this is
[40:25] I eat they don't have tests I'm coming
[40:30] from a place where they we still grow
[40:31] natural stuff I buy your corn I roast it
[40:34] has noticed but if I back home from
[40:38] Ghana and I roasted fastest and I know
[40:41] we also get into a lot of things that we
[40:43] also eating in gallon is becoming this
[40:45] artificial chain of production finish
[40:50] chicken like beef beef is the meat of
[40:54] cattle which you eat here alone it's not
[40:57] very common in Iowa but the beef die in
[41:01] here if you sell nothing there are
[41:02] nobody bite
[41:04] it's absolutely tasteless it is no hard
[41:09] it's all tender I mean it's just bad why
[41:14] because of the artificial production
[41:16] systems we want to baby see cattle when
[41:20] God made cattle cattle is vegetarian
[41:22] they are supposed to move about and
[41:25] grace but we confine them and feed them
[41:31] Prahran was saying when he went to a zoo
[41:33] and saw an eagle in a cage once he said
[41:36] it was the most awful sight he ever saw
[41:38] I mean this was a creature that God made
[41:41] to soar above the sky above the skies
[41:44] about the clouds and he it was caged
[41:48] trying to fly out and just hit his head
[41:50] continuously against the cage it was
[41:53] pathetic they say it doesn't believe any
[41:56] animal should be caged leave them in the
[41:58] bush if people want to see them you
[41:59] should go into the water and watch them
[42:01] in their natural environment like we
[42:02] have the Serengeti and all these things
[42:05] in Africa I mean here you have a lot of
[42:09] why natural reserves where you can go
[42:12] and observe animals in their natural
[42:13] habitat have all these packs
[42:16] but everything that God has given us yet
[42:22] last week pastor was preaching he said
[42:23] look when you are testing real tests qua
[42:28] cool a Pepsi cannot quench status you
[42:31] can drink ten 20 bottles of Cola used to
[42:33] be tested onto that water comes in this
[42:39] is so brethren God has given us the real
[42:41] life but we have rejected that real life
[42:46] telling us last with our life you know
[42:48] so as I'm done speaking my message from
[42:50] that's that message real life God has
[42:54] given us but we have rejected our life
[42:56] for death man is constantly choosing
[43:01] death instead of life look at all of us
[43:09] now take two years ago it was hard for
[43:12] you to see a man 40 50 years ago with
[43:14] that kind of belly that I have yet
[43:20] because you virtually don't walk last
[43:24] week mass I was talking about when he
[43:26] was growing I went very few people had
[43:28] cars maybe one in 10 of everyone in 20
[43:31] had a car so everybody was walking so
[43:34] you are exercising on kinshasa you don't
[43:36] even know and you wake up in the morning
[43:39] you are under air conditioning in the
[43:40] summer you go into an air-conditioned
[43:43] car you go into an air-conditioned
[43:44] office you come back and you come and
[43:47] sleep death death brain we are all
[43:57] walking death is walking alongside us
[44:00] but there is life somewhere let God open
[44:03] our eyes this morning for us to see
[44:06] their life and hold on to their life
[44:11] that's what we need so I'm saying that
[44:14] the message that were around preached
[44:15] the data Bishop Stanley gave him the
[44:17] Bible to read from was about Beth and
[44:21] not only Beth but the pain of Beth and
[44:24] I'm saying that in Christ there is no
[44:27] Syrian session
[44:29] there is no epidural in Christ it's
[44:33] natural birth and natural birth means
[44:36] you must go through pain how was a woman
[44:43] to be saved according to Genesis when
[44:48] God was kissing when God pronounced
[44:50] cases on the woman and they wasn't named
[44:56] anticipate when God cares a woman in the
[45:00] seventh
[45:02] what what were the one supposed to be
[45:05] six it Chobot it meant how is the
[45:13] bride's supposed to be saved
[45:15] Beth they have true page beloved I'm
[45:21] saying that if the first church that was
[45:24] born on Pentacles was born through pain
[45:27] how do you expect a bride to be born in
[45:30] this endtime this lousy cozy type of
[45:35] religion that we have today
[45:38] ha-have uses that as a question as a big
[45:41] I conclude have you gone through your
[45:43] birthday
[45:50] have you gone through your best pain
[45:55] because without it the life of Christ
[45:59] can never coming to you I don't know how
[46:06] many of you will return in the evening
[46:07] but I want to talk about the difference
[46:09] between salvation common salvation
[46:12] that's a continuation of this message
[46:14] different between common salvation and
[46:17] the end time Redemption because it's not
[46:24] the same what is required of us in this
[46:28] end time is completely different from
[46:29] the salvation that has been common
[46:33] throughout the ages
[46:34] well you guys have to confess Jesus
[46:36] Christ as your Lord confess believe in
[46:40] your heart and confess him and you are
[46:41] saved
[46:44] Polaski last week as I was telling you
[46:46] that if you don't go to the pyramid and
[46:49] receive the car stool you can't go in
[46:52] the rapture well if we want to be
[46:55] relaxed a candidate I'm saying that we
[46:57] must be born again and received a
[46:59] genuine party some of the Holy Ghost if
[47:01] not and that new birth
[47:04] Kanaka unless you go through pain and if
[47:10] you don't listen to brother harms tape
[47:12] carefully about birth name you cannot
[47:14] see what he's trying to talk about you
[47:19] cannot see it because when he was ready
[47:21] he was talking about one this is the
[47:23] secret I want to drop before we close
[47:25] that where he was really he was talking
[47:28] about travail of the woman brethren so
[47:33] you can only be born through travail in
[47:38] you must reveal to overcome your
[47:41] prayerlessness you must reveal to
[47:44] overcome your lasts you must reveal to
[47:47] overcome your fornication
[47:49] you must reveal to overcome your lying
[47:51] you must reveal to overcome your
[47:53] stealing
[47:54] you must reveal to overcome your
[47:56] unbelief where the pastor preaches any
[48:00] how about you choose to leave anyhow you
[48:02] like
[48:04] yeah because he's been preached myself I
[48:09] can friend of mine who I I saw he was a
[48:11] deacon of his church and I saw him
[48:13] smoking and drinking in the back and I
[48:15] said hey guy doing the wrong thing you
[48:19] can't be doing this thing as a church
[48:20] leader said leave Church my taste for my
[48:24] past I'll leave me to live my life so
[48:33] beloved the message the main thing that
[48:42] Jesus Christ came for was nubes that's
[48:48] the reason why Christ came when because
[48:53] the most went to him say massa
[48:57] we know you see the Francis where he put
[49:00] Greeks they knew the truth but the video
[49:03] wants to share their fame and glory with
[49:05] somebody I know need to get that person
[49:07] like that
[49:07] so they say we know that the things that
[49:10] you are doing Norman can do them nobody
[49:14] let's go destroy that person so in a
[49:19] conversation she says said unless a man
[49:23] is born again he cannot see the kingdom
[49:25] of God Oh not to him off I said that to
[49:31] him off you see so Jesus he trotted
[49:34] scriptures was referring to this new bed
[49:36] the scripture that we read in John Jesus
[49:40] talking was talking about new birth
[49:42] there are other scriptures when he talks
[49:44] about a grain of wheat unless it goes
[49:48] down everything that reproduces look
[49:54] even bra bra bra bra gives so many
[49:56] examples you notice you know these
[49:58] examples better than I do
[49:59] he gives hope many example he gave the
[50:01] example of even a ring that before it
[50:07] grace what happens jagged rugged skies
[50:12] over thunder and lightning the ragged
[50:16] jagged skies
[50:17] Panda right lighting in Israel brought
[50:20] fought for us to enjoy is that all true
[50:27] the seed before it can bring forth shoot
[50:34] that's what happens droughts
[50:38] it grows completely in the ground
[50:42] whenever and they're great team is that
[50:44] look if a plant bring forth life does it
[50:54] go back to becoming the rotten scene it
[50:56] was before the light sprang though it
[51:00] just keeps growing growing growing
[51:02] growing silly bear fruits and if you
[51:05] have truly been born in Christ that's
[51:07] how it's supposed to be you see the
[51:11] reason why we're having all these
[51:12] problems that we've not gone to the best
[51:15] because if you have truly been born what
[51:18] happens you just grow grow grow till you
[51:21] bring forth fruit you can't go to
[51:24] becoming the rotten see we're from the
[51:26] beginning
[51:30] do you Anasazi Oh hallelujah everything
[51:39] that has the comfort with life has to go
[51:45] through some form of pain pain travail
[51:52] pain even your separation from your
[51:58] denomination or wherever you were before
[52:00] you decided to I mean come to this
[52:03] message it was it's it's done in pain
[52:08] people call you names before this own
[52:10] you because you decided that no you
[52:12] found the truth you want to abandon that
[52:15] foolishness for truth but I because if
[52:18] you I tell of God if
[52:22] a child of God it doesn't matter the
[52:24] condition in which you are but when you
[52:26] hear the word of God there is something
[52:27] inside you that knows that that is the
[52:29] Word of God and you desire to live by
[52:31] the Word of God unless you are not a
[52:33] child of God and you just brush it aside
[52:35] and just Alleluia I with me church
[52:47] birthdays best pains
[52:53] so finally you know I told you some time
[52:59] ago that somebody was preaching and said
[53:02] in conclusion he preached for 15 minutes
[53:04] I've said in conclusion once already
[53:06] they said finally preached for another
[53:09] 15 minutes they saying close same
[53:13] another 15 minutes so he started saying
[53:16] he was closing any pre for 45 minutes
[53:18] I'm not going to do that I want to be
[53:24] brief but I want to read something to
[53:26] you from this day descriptions fulfill
[53:30] yes who confirm what I have told you
[53:33] that these are not my words paragraph 43
[53:41] you have the message on the computer so
[53:43] everybody can see okay all right
[53:55] sorry I didn't open this thing up
[54:07] right I'm really just the paragraph 43
[54:14] for you can go please just a short
[54:16] message sorry I'm late
[54:26] said and just as plain as you could hear
[54:32] any voice a voice came to me and said he
[54:36] ain't dead into nazareth okay let me
[54:38] take it from 42 so that for this is
[54:40] where I can get it well well I go down
[54:42] and look at it again just professed as
[54:45] it could be but the system chapter ends
[54:48] portion of the the portion of it just
[54:52] about three inches from the bottom over
[54:55] at the 17 chapter on the other side
[54:59] that's the same thing and been a new
[55:02] Bible those two pages have definitely
[55:05] stuck together is what I was telling you
[55:08] earlier those two pages have perfectly
[55:10] stacked together and I was reading from
[55:12] the seventeenth chapter instead of the
[55:15] system I said that's all fine it for
[55:19] some costs so Brian was now he because
[55:25] the priests are already told him that
[55:27] this was happy for a reason he was
[55:30] saying that yes God did it that way for
[55:32] a reason and just as plain as you could
[55:36] hear any voice now when problem was
[55:41] thinking that God came down and spoke to
[55:43] him that's what he's referring to us as
[55:46] plain as well hearing me speak now a
[55:48] voice now hooked problem that this is
[55:51] why it happened are you getting it he
[55:56] entered into Nazareth to where he was
[56:00] brought up at and went into the
[56:02] synagogue as it was his custom and the
[56:05] priests gave him the scripture to read
[56:06] and he read Isaiah 61 and where he had
[56:10] read the scriptures he sat down one
[56:12] hundred a priest backed the Bible the
[56:15] book and sat down and all the eyes or
[56:17] the congregation was upon him and
[56:20] precious waist procedure from his mouth
[56:22] he said this day this scripture is
[56:25] fulfilled
[56:27] so this is Barbara hammers
[56:30] interpretation of what happened when he
[56:31] was preaching Beth means this the
[56:34] description so Phil is preach a day
[56:35] after he preached Bev pain so you were
[56:38] following each other now listen
[56:41] carefully how accurate is a scripture if
[56:46] you notice this in isaiah 61:1 - - it's
[56:51] where our Lord was reading from Isaiah
[56:53] 61 1 - 2 but in the middle of the second
[56:57] verse of the as asses the one he stopped
[57:00] why where he said the Spirit of the Lord
[57:03] is upon me to preach the acceptable year
[57:05] then he stopped why the other part to
[57:09] bring judgment didn't apply to his first
[57:12] coming is what I was telling you earlier
[57:14] just to emphasize at least I know my
[57:16] words the other part was not applicable
[57:18] to distress come by his second coming
[57:20] see he didn't apply there how the
[57:23] Scriptures never make a mistake they are
[57:27] always perfect Jesus stopped just where
[57:30] the scripture stopped cause this was
[57:33] exactly what was to be vindicated in his
[57:36] day now in that first coming his beloved
[57:45] let me say something
[57:46] when parabrahma is preaching he never
[57:50] wants to make reference to himself as
[57:53] some prophet or some I mean some divine
[57:58] gift that God has sent to the world he
[58:00] never made himself that way
[58:02] so why he wants to say things when he
[58:05] wants to drop a revelation he's very
[58:08] careful the way he says it
[58:10] because he was preaching among Pentacles
[58:12] he normally preached among the food
[58:14] gospel men so he didn't want to make
[58:16] himself anything okay but listen he's
[58:21] dropping something now he said in that
[58:24] first coming the second coming will
[58:30] bring judgment upon the earth but not
[58:33] them he was to preach the acceptable
[58:37] year amen
[58:40] notice the Messiah standing in the
[58:44] platform to identify himself with the
[58:46] word of the promise for that age so what
[58:52] happened in that first coming was what
[58:55] he was identifying himself with the way
[58:58] because he is crisis a promise
[59:01] he's a promise to the world that he will
[59:04] come he must find that promise in the
[59:09] previously written word something that
[59:11] was has already been written so he went
[59:16] back and took the screws from the Old
[59:18] Testament to read it that look here is
[59:21] where my where is where the prophets
[59:23] were talking about my ministry are you
[59:27] getting it now all allies brahbrah
[59:30] making us making reference to this
[59:33] because you see you should know that the
[59:36] Old Testament is a shadow of the New
[59:38] Testament and the Old Testament and a
[59:41] New Testament are a shadow of today
[59:44] so if Christ had to go back in the Old
[59:51] Testament to show the people his
[59:54] ministry day I live the rest of you amen
[1:00:00] notice the mossad standing in the
[1:00:02] platform to identify himself with a word
[1:00:04] of promise for that age how strange the
[1:00:08] mossad standing are before the church
[1:00:09] and look at this precious word when he
[1:00:11] says to preach the acceptable year amen
[1:00:16] so when you play when you play this tape
[1:00:22] Rob Rahab then goes on to say something
[1:00:24] which I live for the evening service
[1:00:30] Abraham goes on to talk about what he
[1:00:34] was reading
[1:00:36] and what was his last scripture for that
[1:00:41] message
[1:00:45] amen so in other words if one brother
[1:00:51] hold brother Jesus Christ what the Lord
[1:00:54] Jesus Christ read the day he went to
[1:00:59] Nazareth and went into the synagogue and
[1:01:00] was handed over the scroll to read if
[1:01:03] what he read spoke about his first
[1:01:06] coming smoker Behati was coming to do
[1:01:08] then what that Christ that was
[1:01:14] manifested among we the Gentiles I've
[1:01:18] already established you and you all know
[1:01:20] that Rob Rob came in three ministries he
[1:01:23] didn't come in only like the ministry
[1:01:25] that is why he pre this message this day
[1:01:28] discretize fulfill come play the tape he
[1:01:31] down demonstrated to the people he
[1:01:33] turned his back to their congregation
[1:01:36] and I started telling them what was in
[1:01:40] the heart there was one particular Ummah
[1:01:41] he mentioned the woman's name to a head
[1:01:44] that the child was possessed somewhere
[1:01:46] and she was praying for a child who back
[1:01:49] if you believe like like in the days of
[1:01:52] Jesus cry when you go back your child be
[1:01:54] well before he gets booked now why he
[1:01:57] did that he came to them said what you
[1:01:59] think is that so it is meant for the
[1:02:01] people to catch something
[1:02:04] the reason why he did I was able to
[1:02:07] catch something that hey this is not an
[1:02:09] ordinary ministry LeBron was a man a
[1:02:13] human being don't get me wrong I'm not
[1:02:14] Abraham is Jesus Christ don't get me
[1:02:16] wrong but I'm saying that God is using
[1:02:19] the man to demonstrate the ministry that
[1:02:22] Jesus Christ demonstrated on earth to us
[1:02:25] because we Jada's never had the benefit
[1:02:27] of a prophet in Hermes throughout the
[1:02:30] church ages apart from the early church
[1:02:32] apostles who approached on for audibles
[1:02:36] who were prophets we never and they were
[1:02:38] Jews they were no I mean they were not
[1:02:40] Gentiles anyway so Hebron was a first
[1:02:43] Gentile profit so in that Ministry of
[1:02:47] one gentle prophet he brought three
[1:02:49] ministries together are you
[1:02:54] so beloved Beth is all we need and the
[1:03:01] Beth can only come by traveling it can
[1:03:04] only come trooping brother we are all
[1:03:07] everything so many things awareness now
[1:03:10] no prayer so many things a lot of
[1:03:14] technology has been bombarded to us you
[1:03:16] can't have time to read anything
[1:03:17] whenever you are in your bed every one
[1:03:22] one of my co-workers in Ghana to me said
[1:03:25] he was complaining I mean telling me
[1:03:30] about some friend I mean you were saying
[1:03:32] in the presence of our friends he said I
[1:03:34] came to your house and I saw you sitting
[1:03:37] somewhere on your laptop and your
[1:03:41] husband is sitting in a corner his
[1:03:42] laptop I mean me I can't live like that
[1:03:45] oh how can you be married and you are my
[1:03:47] everybody's on laptop here is another
[1:03:52] kind of marriages we have everybody has
[1:03:55] something in the ear and watching
[1:03:57] something so we don't talk among our
[1:03:59] friends our children growing up now
[1:04:01] don't have even friends that they play
[1:04:03] with that is why there's so much mental
[1:04:07] depression and all these dumb violence
[1:04:10] and HR justice a gun and goes through a
[1:04:12] square side killing people technology
[1:04:15] when I was growing up I don't stay in my
[1:04:18] room I can't stay in my room
[1:04:20] I'll come out my neighbors children will
[1:04:23] also come out we play on the street we
[1:04:25] run after each other
[1:04:27] so we form strong bonds strong
[1:04:29] friendship as we grew up now everything
[1:04:35] is artificial if we children going to
[1:04:37] part to play they have to be supervised
[1:04:39] for our happening hey you can play here
[1:04:42] here you can play all sort of I'm lot of
[1:04:44] mechanical lifestyle is this where are
[1:04:47] we heading to us life has become so
[1:04:51] mechanical there's no naturality to it
[1:04:57] people must flow human where are you
[1:04:59] human beings are social

[1:05:09] that's how God created them we were
[1:05:12] created to be family people so sharp

[1:05:21] live here I can leave if I leave you our
[1:05:22] dad the pressure will kill him not
