while good to see man brother Randy brother Adam all the faces amen just just happy to be in the house of the Lord you know and um honor I tell her Brooks always honor to come and had feel like I didn't know I hadn't been here you know that long but but I say but Lord give us Grace um boy I I can just tell you so much I moved to Alabama um got a what almost a two-month old now about a two-month old now so two girls in a boy amen so maybe next time I come I can bring the clan amen so I just uh sing this little song Amen as we just go before the Lord I just want to sing this little hymn amen it says thank you Lord God as the de panted for the wat so my soul long gift that to thee you alone are my heart desire and I long to worship thee can you just tell him one more time Lord God oh as the de fall the wat so my so long after thee Lord you alone Lord God you alone all my heart desire and I long to worship thee for you alone Are My Strength my shield for you alone does my spirit yes Lord you are are my heart desire and I long to workship be just one more time for you alone it says there's no one like him it said there's no one above her does my spirit he said let your spirit he says oh you you are alone Lord God desire and I long to worship thee amen you get a l hand clap I tell you he says uh David he said he said as the deer God bless you brother and you said you know brother bradam spoke about it many times of a deer is an animal that once is wounded he said if he can only find a little bit of water if he can only find something he says to just cure The Thirst and you see this morning if you came here this morning he says oh I see he said oh it must be the brother he said from Congo he said we I used to be in Atlanta church we had Ghana Nigeria Congo but I believe when the spirit Falls there's only one body it's only one rejoicing and he say when a deer is thirsty the deer rejoices because it knows that his life is dependent upon the Water so I just ask you tonight have you come this morning have you come to a place that you're so thirsty this morning that he says you said that you came to see God he said maybe your neighbor didn't come to see God but you came in Great Expectations sister Angie because you know that your life depends on if you can get a drink brother Lord I ask you before we get into the word I ask you brother you say if water your body is made up of more water than anything it's more ele any element of the world is water amen and you know when you look at how water is split out it's the most explosive thing oxygen and hydrogen on the face of the earth now when the spirit of God moves over the seed that he put in you before the foundation of the world you might clap your hands you might say thank you God you might you right but I tell you as a seed of God I tell you you will because you know that the refreshing is only coming from him amen so I I I I just before we get into the word this morning I just want to tell you what did you come to expect to see this morning what's your expectation this morning and you see your expectation means everything to God right think about that depending on where you're sitting right now you're either in Heavenly places or you're not amen so you got to think that means you have a spiritual mind or a carnal mind but he says now God says he hates that mind that's caral this morning right and it'll bring death to your body right but if we could just step up a little higher this morning hallah and you can just tell but it's a little higher then now you can see he said the glory of God and you see that's why David when he spoke he said in Psalm let the redeem 136 he said let them say so amen so it had to be a people on the earth that knew that they were Redeemed by God and they weren't waiting to get to heaven because if you see if you don't praise God you see we ain't started service yet but you see if you don't praise God now you won't even Praise Him in the grave if you don't praise God now you won't Praise Him in heaven because the Bible says around the throne the 24 Elders he said they were worshiping God and they said they took off their throne and they said they came down and said amen amen they said blessed and glory and then he says why give honor Thanksgiving he's worthy this morning so in order to get in Heavenly places you have to know by the word where you're standing right now this morning and that's why I ask you this morning you see I can tell you see there's still a cloud over here and you see see the cloud we go oh Lord God thank you Jesus and you see when the cloud is there the cloud has to be removed in order for you get your blessing oh help me Lord God but you see here but you see remember you see brother Brandon was speaking and he say he says we have to break through all the sound barriers of what unbelief so that means in order for us to come together and see God we must come in unity he said we got to come to a place that every heart and mind is in one place this morning now let me just read this scripture to you let me the Lord help me let me read this scripture to you and you see before we get into the word you say God will come and and he know he knows what you need amen so let me just read this to you uh um turn with me 1 Peter 5 and sometime you know the lord always take you different ways but I just want to just read just maybe two or three scriptures before we get into the word and I want you to look at First Peter 5 before we pray now look at this scripture he says in verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so this morning we have to first recognize who hand we're under amen we have to recognize now remember the Bible says heaven and is strong strong and he said Earth Is His foottoo so we have to know where we're at we're under God's feet this morning now you say all everything being above us here he come brother Keith and now he tells us just humble ourselves am amen now humble ourselves mean first take off all your thoughts all your ideas and start thinking about him amen he said now this is humility now and then he says he says that he may exalt your neighbor he said that he may exalt the pastor that he may exalt you Brother Richard he said no no he said that he may exalt you brother keth that means me the individual amen so now this morning God wants to exalt you but let us first come humbly before his Stone now what do I what you mean Brother Kyle I mean when you came those doors do you know who is keeping your heart beaten right do you know when you cranked your car you know who let your car start oh you thought it was Everlast oh you oh you thought just because you know you got to tune up no no look he cranked your car and he had to give you money to put gas in the Tank come on somebody and then he allowed you to come here and then walk all the way through the doors and that's what the brother said he said you enter into his courts with Thanksgiving amen amen so now remember we're still talking about being in Heavenly places in Christ this morning so now let's keep reading now he says in verse S he says if you don't get nothing else today he says casting all your care upon Him amen for why for he car for you the individual this morning now I got to read this to you now think about this now he says there should there should not be anything on your mind other right now than what Jesus Christ did for you Hallelujah I want you to think about this now now you see there's some people they already ready to go eat after church some of you woke up hungry this morning you missed breakfast you might not be thinking about him yeah now you might be thinking this morning you know what did did I brush my teeth you might not be thinking about him amen you was you think about when you got up you was looking at your socks and your pants and you but you might not be thinking about him but to come here he says cast all your cares on him now it's a promise there and that promise is for you this morning to say because he cared for everything you could think is a problem amen everything you think could be an issue he said cast it amen so cast it mean it's not yours anymore cter means it's not your neighbors cter mean it's God's this morning Hallelujah and what ever you cast to God tell me what he can Sol he asked he says is he as say is anything too hard for the Lord is anything too hard for the Lord this morning sir so you see so what's so hard for God to come down our mid you say the only thing that happens is if we grieve him away so God always wants to come we just can't grieve him so now let me oh let me keep reading so he says be sober be diligent because your adversary the devil the Devil comes to every church service he sits down in the Pew and he tells you he say Chrystal man you know you know why'd you get up this morning you know you know what you got to do today you know what money goingon to be like come on you know come you know you think you need a little rest this morning but I let me but let me ask you remember when it used to be Friday night and you just got paid yeah and you had a knot like this you was ready to go do something and you see it didn't matter if anybody else wanted to go with you you had in your mind that you were going to go and have a good time now it's Sunday morning now right and you say you love the Lord and you say he's done everything for you amen then he said why is it so hard to give God a good hand clap well sometime it just you know you go plac you see people just it's so hard it's just like something just holding down the hand and but when they have a need help me Lord help me Lord you see you see they can't clap but they turn the cups real easy you see it's easy help me help me what about just saying thank you Lord God now I'm ask you this now I'm ask you he said this is what he's talking about how much he cares for you now I want to show you to this day why you see it's so hard let let me keep reading and he says as a a roaring Lon walking about seeking whom he may devour she says whom resist that fast how in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world Amen there are other people this morning that are still walking the church there are other people that haven't got because they walk four hours every C there are other people that are still they they're hiding to have church this morning and they and everybody doesn't even have a Bible and think where we're at we have life a microphone you see a tambourine that's why is so he's so worthy but he got to be so careful to give him all praise now I want you to think about this I want you to think about this as he keep reading and it says but look at verse 10 but the God of all Grace now not some but the Bible says the God of all Grace this morning amen he said who ha called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while Paul says all in Christ himself amen so it must be something to suffer it must be something to be in shaped to be in cut it must be something he said but after you went through a little something he says to you it'll make you perfect amen now who here this morning wouldn't mind being perfect Hallelujah heyy I I saw a lot of hands that say I don't mind suffering Lord I don't mind suffering Lord God I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting it says I don't mind waiting on the Lord I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting I don't mind wait waiting on the Lord now just sing it one more time I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting on you Lord I don't mind waiting I don't mind waiting I don't mind wait on you Lord I don't mind trting I don't mind trusting I don't mind trusting in you Lord I don't mind trusting I don't mind trusting I don't mind and trust in you Lord do you believe that this morning as we bow this morning oh Lord gracious Heavenly Father we know that there's no one like you Lord God there's no one like you in the heavens Lord God there's no one like you in the earth Lord and Heavenly Father we have just come here this morning Lord to give you all the praise all the honor that you're well worthy of Lord God and heavenly father we thank you for the grace you've given each and every one to just press their way out this morning Lord God and Heavenly Father we ask Lord God that you just come and take over the service Lord God that you'll come and speak to the hearts and mind of your people this morning and may they see you sitting on the throne father Lord God for without you lord we can do nothing father we ask you in Jesus Christ name we pray Lord we say amen amen won't make make you stand as you just take your seats this morning I was saying it's an honor to be back in the house of the Lord here in the beautiful state of Iowa amen and uh I say you know brother bramy speak so many times how it's a big thing I tell about Brooks said for a pastor to give up his pull pit and I say to stand here I said uh I said I'm I feel like I'm definitely the least of many of you so I'm just here by his grace I want to read something to you before we get started and uh my arm in this and said I want to read something to you before we get started and I want you to look at this and I say man like Lord maybe this is why he puts things together way he does he said it is I Be not Afraid let me read something to you right this night while we're sitting here if he said and this is this say same thing this morning if this right atmosphere would take place this entire group would be refilled with the Holy Ghost amen he said every sick person would be made well it's the atmosphere that does [Laughter] it now now look at let me just keep reading let help me you can take a hen a hen egg and put it in an incubator and keep the atmosphere just right and it'll hatch out a chicken not an incubator C because it's the ACT atmosphere that counts put a chicken egg under a dog it'll hatch a chicken it's the atmosphere and that's what it takes in the church today amen it it not so much starchy Creed and theology it says but the spirit of the Living God pouring down upon his people to bring a spiritual atmosphere amen not one saying I believe it's this and another one I believe is that it's hard for the Holy Spirit to work now look at that now he says and do you know when the Holy Spirit first came it was on the day of Pentecost and when they were all in one place and one Accord And Then There came from Heaven a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind and they had to get the atmosphere right amen now turn with me to Revelations 3 I want y'all to look at it this morning many people are going through the motions when it comes to going to church they're coming to church because it's a ritual they come to church because it's a good thing to do they come to church because you know maybe I'll go to heaven if I come to church but when you come into the presence of God hallelujah you have to realize that God wants to touch you and you see in this hour as we're going to read there's many people that have not been touched by the Lord so that's why you see many churches I go to the jail I tell you I matter fact I tell you a little bit about it you see people that they say they love God but they're not rejoicing in what they say they have amen now I ask you this morning if you say you love God Amen then where is your rejoicing where is it that you know what God did for you he didn't have to do amen where is it that now from you from the bottom of your heart if you can tell me that God did something for you then why can't you give him anything back am now I'm going ask you this now because you see God is no like there's no one like him and the only thing that you get so coose is just to be in his presence is when now that Holy Spirit drops into an individual and when he drops into an individual is God trying to pull you to a place to show you how perfect he sees you now I'm speaking now to that person that says they love God yeah but I ask you sometime why does it seem like it's so hard for people in this house he say what is the spirit on the land that's now is hovering over the people yeah and people are more concerned about money yes they're more concerned about their job they're more you as a person you say well you know Brother Kyle you know hey I tell you what we got church on Wednesday night I don't know if I can beat it I need to overtime but you had a choice to work on THS yeah well you know what I tell you well I just go ahead and miss church CU you know everything will be all right yeah and you ask but it shows that you don't believe your presence is important now think about this now yes sir this room is at a certain temperature right now because of all the bodies in here and everybody in here is putting out about 98 Degrees of heat so it'll get a little hot in here but it may get cold if you won't get into the service you see I was telling somebody I was telling the church in Atlanta and this is a church I was telling you we had a lot of Africans I tell the brother said we go to church I said you know I've seen the people we get dancing in the a we get to having a good time oh there's no one There's No One Like Jesus there's no one and I as I said but why is it so hard to say when everybody comes over here that nobody gets into the service because you get that American Spirit oh Lord I don't know why this ain't my P and this American Spirit ain't no good it's not the Holy Spirit and I want to tell you about this morning is the Holy Spirit and you see when he comes he gives you a reason to Rejoice he gives you a reason now to say thank you God because you see I know brothers and some of you brothers and sisters may know that are here and they they trying so hard they don't have a Visa and they're trying to get that green card and we come at night and we pray and we pray and we pray and now here come the husband here come the wife but you see we had to get into the service glory to God we had to get into something and you see if you go to a ball game and you man you know you say they'll call you lame right you going to sit there the whole time and you just watching the game I went to a football game it was I I went when I went to school right I never been to a football game my I was telling brother BR I said I got a I got a brother-in-law drove all the way to my house and drove always that's 6 hours from South Carolina almost seven and drove two more hours to go back to tell land to go to football game and I was like Lord boy I guess you ain't tired huh but if it come to ready to go to church maybe Sunday morning well you know we got a long drive ahead of us we got a long drive brother I'm like what you know I'm sitting there like he better not ever tell me that I can't wait to tell him I'm like hold on now you drove here 30 minutes and two hours the other way now I tell you this but before the football game before the kickoff we went he when I was living in Atlanta we went to my school he was playing his school first time been to a game and the kickoff has happened and I'm looking around and now the guy puts on the te everybody getting ready and now when they when the GU start bouncing the whole stadium start coming up and people go oh and he ain't even kicked the ball yet man he ain't even got to the ball yet and when they they getting ready cuz they want to see the kick and when the balls everybody now say what about when you come to church now come on now and you say you love God and you say you can't give him nothing come on somebody I'm asking you something and he said he wants to touch you he said he blessed you he said he keeps you and he said the ball is up in the air glory god he said now look the song leader maybe all he got to do is just walk up to the pull pit everybody oh praise the Lord they be like oh what's going on in mother Church they say oh what's going on he say why because it's a typical now but you ask what about where is that Joy people have of now saying that Jesus will touch him because when Jesus touches you get strength and when he touch you he said you can never be the same amen Hallelujah see let me read this scripture let's read Revelations 3 I just want you to see the condition of the age you see because we're in the last you see those that not have not come out of lay the seal he said it's those that have not taken the word for their day and the word for the day God diagnoses the the church in this hour God did his own diagnosis and he came and he said let me tell you what the last in the last days what the spirit will be on the church yeah yeah and let me tell you how people will act and now look at this he says I just read in verse 15 to make it sure I Know Thy works and that thou are neither cold or hot I would you be cold or hot so God is saying that the people in this last day he said that they're not on fire for God Amen he's saying they're in between yeah he said they come to church oh praise the Lord but he said I rather you sit home yeah or you come to church and have church now think about this now this what God now this is see this ain't this building this is God saying that you'll be in or out of his mouth so God is putting you in a place this morning amen so I ask you this morning how hot are you or How cold are you now I want you to think when you sitting next to somebody and they say they a little bigger see my brother right here overall see he's a little bit bigger he might prob a little more heat than me but let's just say as we sitting here now he's going to be putting out something now if the room is hot he's going to get hot but the room is cold he's going to get colder but he should always be hotter than me because of how big he is right now you ain't that big but you just have big you so let's just say this now I'm asking you this morning God says if we sit in the same place if I'm in between and he says if he's hot he said he'll take him he says if he was even cold if he didn't want to be here this morning God said he can still deal with him but he says if I halfway get into the service he said if I'm halfway thinking oh well you know I tell you what brother man wish she just wish she just come on okay praise the Lord yeah I do believe that yeah you know wish she keep talking about them ties I tell you that boy I tell you them ties he boy he in my wallet now ain't he brother he keep keep hitting on them ties every week Glory now think about this now praise the Lord now you in between now God can say I'd rather deal with him and he could be stinking half drunk God said I'd rather deal with him than deal with you K because you so far in between now look this is how he diagnosed how people would be in the church in the last day oh Lord I hope you see this and he said now and so then because you lukewarm you need to C hot he said I'll spew you out of my mouth so now God's not dealing with you that's oh Lord God he said I'm not dealing with that Lord God I'm either dealing with those that believe or those that sin oh I hope you see this now because he wants to touch you oh let me see this so because thou sayest but I'm rich now because you say you got loot because you say you got money he say and everything's going well you increase with goods and you don't need nothing he said you don't know yeah that you are wretched you're miserable and poor and blind and naked so these are people that are going to church and he's saying you don't know the sad State you're in and it's hard to tell somebody that is blind that don't see nothing and say well I want to help you out but they say I ain't blind they just bumping into everything they say I ain't blind ain't nothing wrong with me now that looks crazy doesn't it but you see this is how God diagnosed the people so he's saying there's people that go into church that act like they don't need God yeah and he said I want to help you but he says will you let me now let me keep reading I counsel thee to buy me gold Tri and the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Ren and thou mayest be clothed and thou and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and I want you to look around in verse 18 wish we could take time to break it all down but I just want you to look at this part and anoint thy eyes with eyes s that thou may see so God doesn't want any one of us in this age to be blind that's right amen right and you got to think now if God is telling you to anoint your eyes then the eyes s he's speaking of brother Keith it has to be here on the earth so now look at he's pointing to eyes now eyes Val is something you put on your eyes eyes Val is something that you can apply but you see here he's telling you that you have to do it because I've already provided it now he's saying is going to take away your spiritual blindness so when your eyes become open how can you not worship God when your eyes become open that you see the grace of God on your life then now you say why are you not rejoicing knowing that in this hour that he's not dealing with some people now in John 17 Jesus said I pray for my own not the world so God if God don't pray for you how you going to make it amen if God don't give you this isself how you going to make it amen if he don't tell you now how do you use this eyes he says repent now he says in this hour be very zous he said be very zealous why because he saw that Spirit coming over the church and remember he said in this hour he said it was almost total darkness amen almost total darkness that comes over the church so people hear the word but now for some reason they're resisting letting it take root in their life amen now let's think about this now let's turn I want you to go over with me to uh go with me to um um Mark Mark I can't yeah let me just let's go over here to Mark and I want you to see if God Mark 8 if God comes and he's telling you that the people need this it's because he's speaking to a condition that's suddenly coming to church and it's a warning for those that want to overcome in the last time in last hours amen now let me read this quote to you as we turn to Mark 8 I just want to read something to you now Lord let me let me see make try to make this little short um let let me just read this this is the resurrection he said basically what we could use he said is a good old fashion Holy Ghost sent Revival men back to believing the word of God that God will take care of us and he says like he did in the old days he will take care of us he says today amen now do you believe that God will take care of us what we need today he said is another refilling he says another like the disciples Hallelujah now remember what he referring to remember that Peter and you said John they were preaching and you said they went by the gate called beautiful and they healed the man remember they had just he gave acts 238 he told him repent be baptized name of Jesus Christ and then I got to pause let me just drop this in Lord God let me pause he says acts 230 I think it's verse uh 42 I just read it to you and it says remember they went through certain afflictions and then when they were actually having to go before the council the council wanted to persecute them and then it says to the Believers this is what happened after the Holy Ghost fell down it says in verse four I just read 40 and with many other words he did testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this unto gener generation and he says then they that gladly received his word it says what they were baptized now come on now so you see we're talking about going past believing this morning amen but I'm asking you if you enter in going on to being baptized this morning now you say just in the water Brother Kyle no I'm talking about in his Spirit now look at here now now look at if we wanted to see the same thing the same Holy Ghost move he says in 41 and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and it says and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine they didn't change the word and he say and what Fellowship Lord God let St you see God wants fellowship and you see we come this morning to Fellowship around his word so well I want you to keep reading with me now and it says and in the breaking of bread so that means there was some eating going on naturally and spiritually when Believers get together Lord God help me you say he's bringing us together to show us a just a glimpse of what brother Randy heaven is like so you said there's Fellowship there's breaking of bread there's the word and then he says and In Praise amen so you can't do any of this without the spirit of God that's right now remember this is 42 this is after after he gave them the prescription Dr Peter yeah so now there's Fellowship going on there's one body everybody's together happy in Christ there's no big eyes there's no little you he said the spirit of God is moving now let me let me go let me let's turn back over now let's look at uh Mark 8 and we'll come back to this he says uh verse 22 and he cometh to be be besida and and they bring him a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him now let me keep reading this Paul stay with me for a second now think about it this man need a touch some of you trying to test an experience or trust it that they had 10 years ago that's all right but what about today amen now you need one today today is the day sure of feeling the disciples about three or 4 days after they received the Holy Ghost went back and got in one Accord amen look now and began to pray again with one Accord until the Holy Ghost shook the building where they were sitting am amen what we need God so now I got to pause for Mark for a second if you go back over to acts you'll see that now remember they have been threaten right remember they were doing Miracles they were they were doing the will of the Lord and the Pharisees Sadducees wanted to persecute them and when they wanted to persecute them they would now had to come before the C and they had to give account of what how do you do the things you do yeah and he says in what power and they say we do it all in a man that was approved of God yeah and he said his name was Jesus Christ now he says but now you neglected him you didn't want to hear the word for your day he said you wanted something different you didn't want to enter into the spirit of what God was doing in the hour so you see here now Lord help me he says now so they go and they they're questioned right they're threatened and they tell them don't you ever go and do this no more don't go and preach this gospel in the name of Jesus Christ we don't want to hear this and then the disciples go out and they go and tell those other people that want to hear the word am and when they go tell them they says now let me just I want to read you this one part of it let me read this one part and I'm going jump back to Mark Lord God I think it's acts five but it says when they were let go it says reported all that the chief and priest had told the elders now they told these people they said look they said this is everything they did to us this man that was whole that it said the Bible say he was older than 40 years old it said this particular man he says they knew that God did it yeah they knew God did it they knew these men were ignorant and unlearned they heard the way they talk but they knew that they had been with Jesus they took note that they had been with the Lord now look at this with me now now when they lifted up their voice the people lifted up their voice the people now heard the report and they got excited now it wasn't the preachers it was the people now I'm still going to ask you are you excited let me keep reading he say now look at verse 25 the question that comes up that touches me they said as David the servant of God said why did the Heathen rage and he said the people imagine vain things why were the people's thoughts on so many carnal things other than the things of God Amen why were people always thinking about you know how I can get over yeah how I can now make a next Buck he say what what else about what's going to change in my family they think about all these vain things that will pass away but why are they not thinking of God and the Bible said these people were heathens now think about this now we're all Gentiles but now by Sav by the grace of God if you take this word The Same Spirit then now God has to look at you differently that's right and what he said in the scriptures you cannot think vain thoughts and now be that saved Gent coming out of this hour you cannot be this person you have to be something different now let me read this now if you drop down this go all the way they praised God they were giving glory to God but in verse 31 after they prayed it says the place was shaken where they were assembled and were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke the word with boldness now look at this now if God did it then God still does the same thing now yes sir and I want you to think about this morning the prophet God what he's speaking of is that people in this hour the church the whole body he says to bream Tabernacle to wherever you are in the world he says we all need a refilling now I want you to think there's a feeling and then there's a refilling now a refilling means that now if you had the holy spirit before God wants to give you a little bit more amen now I want you to think about this this morning now because in Mark 8 this is the story it's a man that he was blind and this blind man it says he was in the city of Bethesda and Bethesda you see this city was called the house of fishing and this is the place where Peter was from Andrew was from and being from this place it wasn't really a great place to be from like brother was telling about Lima he said the streets of Li it maybe not the best best place to be from but you see but God brought him out am now come on somebody God brought him out and you see it's nothing like good friends amen you can have friends but there good friends you see now remember when the man he was impotent and Jesus Christ was in the house and as he was sitting in the house the Bible says that it was a man that had some good friends yeah and the friends saw the condition of their friend amen and they didn't leave them outside the church but their friend tried to take them to church they tried to now get them in the presence of God now the man couldn't get there so let me tell you what they did they went and they got this man up and they said man lay him out bro lay him out and they got him up and they put him somehow on top of this man house and They Carried this man all over the roof y'all a hear me and you see they were real friends now real friends and I think they might have been filled once glory to God and you see now something was pulling in them that deep calling to the Deep to pull this man up to get to Jesus now all I'm supposed to do this morning is let you get a little closer to Jesus if you can get in his presence you get a little closer to him you will never ever be the same this morning but have you cast it on your cars yet amen now when they pull him up on the roof as they're pulling him it's about four of them and as they're pulling him up they get all the way to the top and there's a problem yeah let's say this house got a a metal sheet ring a sheet tin and it and it and that they wonder how in the world we going to get them in Jesus I believe maybe one of them brothers they said you know what man we need a change so we need a change so and they looked at the roof and the Bible said that they started busting up the man roof now you see some of y'all may not like that but you see if I was hurting I want somebody to te the roof off I want somebody to get me to Jesus amen now you see when they went and they started cutting the hole now the Bible said they cut a hole in this man's roof and they started to lower this man down now he might not have been they might have been EMTs brother Adam but it might have been jerking everywhere but it didn't matter how hurt he was because at the time he got to Jesus Jesus he touched him he didn't need no scalpel he didn't need no syringe he didn't need no medicine all he needed was a touch Lord God oh I hope you see it this morning and a touch is all you need this morning if you come into His presence Just a Touch Hallelujah and I want you to see this morning we look at this story this man that was blind you see he saw the condition of that City yes he saw where he came from he knew that it was a bad spot he knew that not everybody makes it out of there and gets their sight but this blind man he says you know what I got some good friends yeah and the Bible says they went and they brought him to Jesus Jesus had just maybe did what he just fed the 5,000 just fed the 4,000 and that's not including women and children and now he was they were supposed to go over to Beth societet the first time but they got caught into a little traffic yeah and he walked on the water saying to the disciples they didn't know all this but he had to get to this blind man because you see Jesus told him to go over to besida yeah but the wind came up against him and they ended up going to another place before they got here yeah but I believe as the Bible tells us it has to be for this blind man yeah amen this blind man his friends bring him to Jesus and he comes to Jesus and they said if we can just get Jesus Christ to touch him yeah if we can get Jesus to touch his situation it wasn't he wasn't just coming to church he said just to come to church brother I he had a certain situation amen see he wasn't coming because he couldn't walk think about this now he wasn't coming because he had money problems yeah he wasn't coming see his need was he was blind and I tell you this morning your individual need means more to Jesus than the problem amen that's what he see let me keep reading this he was coming to get delivered from a situation that nobody else could change I want you to think about this now and when you have one of those problems it'll make you fall on your knees I was telling the guy on the airplane I've never had this happen had my Bible I sat down and something was like said hey I just like looked at the guy I'm like say hey I'm like hey how you doing man he said hey how you doing he didn't say nothing else open up my Bible I said I'mma read something and I started reading before the plane took off God said but Kyle he know he says hey man he said Kyle like uh I've never got on the airplane and seen somebody with the same reading mat I looked over I said huh my I ain't never seen that either brother I'm like I'm on the airplane so I'm looking I started looking at the Bible then he started talking to me he said well like what you read and the guy had just got finished out of college by 20 some year old we got to talking and what touched me was if Paul said I perceive he had Faith yeah yeah yeah and he was like you know you know I just don't see many people pick up the Bible and read and he said I'm from Michigan and I moved down here in this small town of tcoa Georgia and he said I'm kind of by myself and I just kind of feeling like I need to start getting with God yeah and you know I said well pra praise the Lord let's talk about it and I'm over here brother BR know he said man my ear but started popping and I'm like oh horse and I was sitting there the whole time and I'm like I couldn't stop talking about him and I was saying I pray I'm not too loud and I'm just talking about I said well you know he was telling about even bap AP ISM he saying well you know I going to church and why you think how the baptism go you read acts 238 amen you know now I can show you now look now I'm going tell you it's a difference see when I go to the prison I was telling the guys I say now some of you you locked up here and I said I can tell by your spirit that you still want to remain the same I said now this a Bible class and I said you don't want to bring your Bible and you sitting up there with shades on I tell I think I tell brother a guy sitting there with shades on I tell you just imagine a guy sitting there like you in church and he got shades on I'm thinking well Lord maybe something going on with his eyes I don't know but when it came time to sign a little roster he picked the shades up and he like now I'm like now this man maybe almost 50 in the 50s now and I'm saying you sitting there like you the coolest thing in here and I tell him plainly I said now this a Bible class so what you doing showing up with no Bible yeah now I'm asking you plainly is that if you want life if you want a program then you need to go sign up for another class yeah but if you want Christ then that's why we came here now I say that to you because this man as I'm telling him about the word he stops and he's like oh let me let me get a pencil Lord now I'm asking you I sit down I don't know this man oh God I don't know this man but now I say but he said but you know you mind if I get your number and your email address and I asked him I said but if he wants the Lord then I'm supposed to tell him I got my little song book I said yeah let me tell you about this man right here he said because he was talking about different things and religions and why this is off and this I said let me show you now I show him a picture and had brother brand with the cloud over and I said now want you think about this now I said now this man is a man of God Amen and I said let me tell you he said when God start dealing with me I read a message that he preached called persevering and I said it was about this Mexican lady down in there and what touching by the end of it he was talking about how this woman came up she had a dead baby baby had been dead that morning prayed over the baby and the baby came back to life yeah and I was sitting there like but the thing was they said it been raining that day and he said he started early that morning that they had been sitting out there waiting for the service late that night and I was sitting there like you know many people say they love God yeah but have you ever been that persevering for anything in your life for God anything I want you think about that anything and that's said I told myself said I remember reading what this man was saying and I was on my couch and I broke down in Te broke me down and I've had many guys that I've seen come and go ran the streets with I can tell you so much but I want to speak something to you when that heard that word it was something that broke me down and say you ain't persevering enough for God you say you love God you say you love him but you really ain't really try yeah oh Lord now now brother BR that message he says anything you ever got from God you really tried you persevered in order to get it any of y'all went to school any of y'all play sports he said now tell me you ain't put no effort into it think about think I me the books you had to read see how many nights you had to stay up but then when it come to God I'm just going to show up to church let the preacher bless me man let the preacher put me in heaven cuz I'm here let me put Let me let me dig deep today get my dollar out boy look at look what I did for the Lord think about it now so I want you to see spiritually now where we're at is that it's no different for I just talking to this young man it's no different to see there's people that are getting hotter and there's people that are getting so cold amen and I I only want you to see this little story to see where you're at yeah amen when this man came he came and his friends brought him and they brought him for the reason to have Jesus touch his situation amen and when they ask Jesus to touch him I want you to see the Bible says he took the man in his same condition yeah and he was blind amen so God if he can heal a blind man then he can still H help and save the Blind Men now but the question is is do you know you're blind you see some of our eyes have been open maybe some haven't but you have to know your condition this morning and you got to look at it now remember God is not coming to save those that's already saved that's right he's coming to speak to you whatever sit you what you were in basically to what give you life amen and so now you have to recognize what condition you are in this morning so that God can touch you now look at what he says when they come back the he took the blind man by the hand and the Bible says now it's Jesus and this man that's blind and they walk all the way out the city sometimes you got to get away from all unbelief sometimes you got to get away from old friends you say Old Situation and now God has to take you by the hand to take you from the fishing house to take you a little bit outside of that and now show you he says what I can do for you now think about it what if this man along the way when he started his journey and he said he loved the Lord what what if he took his hand back and think how many people start on the journey and they pull their hand back amen but your hand has to stay in the hand of the maker amen now remember as they're walking hand in hand it's him and Jesus yeah maybe he asked them where you from he said you know how'd you get in this situation how long you been blind were you born this way maybe he's talking now he knows all things but maybe he's just talking to him and as they're talking they get to a place that they have to stop now I want you to see this because remember what he wanted was a touch he stops and he says when he led him out of the town and when he has Spit on His Eyes he put his hands on now I want you to see when you want to judge the nature of Christ you got to look back at the word of God and when you see the nature of God it's not going to be like what everybody thinks right when you look at John the Baptist with a with a wiry beard a leather girdle and you say eating wild Locus and honey may be got honey all over being you say uh Are you ashamed to say that's your pastor Lord think about it now you know he got the word of the Lord ah you Snakes in the Grass y' y'all church a little different brother you know y'all Church you know I don't know about the worship service it seem John a little you know think about it now he said but look you had to go out to go see John John his dad was a priest but you see John God did a special work with John amen it's no different than this man he's out and he has a man that he's never seen before and the man he comes to him Brother Richard and he looks and he says me look at your situation I hope that's right brother amen amen I'm blind but what is he about to do now think about this now now come on now he said and look you got to say his b are blind that he like I know I'm blind but I ain't crazy but he had a bad situation I hope you see this and now he couldn't run while God got some spit together glory to God he couldn't go nowhere but he had to stay right there yeah and he stays there brother brother Brook he stays there and he says okay well he led me this far GL to God he let me this far amen and I can't see amen and it's something about his voice it's something about him he said I I'm blind and I know I had good friends that bought me here and I know he wants to change my situation amen I'm just going to sit here for a minute yes sir so Jesus and he spits in both eyes and the man is still standing there and as he's standing there now maybe he has spit hanging off both our legs and it's hanging down just like this amen now you see when it comes to God things get ugly a little time he said every birth is a mess and you sometimes you see the fear of people they just not willing to let go yeah amen and they're scared if they get into the service that somebody's going to look at them they scared that maybe if they let Jesus touch their situation that now they everybody's going to talk about praise the Lord but I'm asking you what about your condition amen is your condition big enough to you say I really don't care about about a lugie hanging in my eyes amen I really don't care what people think but Lord I Need Your Grace Lord God so Lord I'm standing here Lord God and Father I want you to please do something for me amen now and tell you i' see it in the prison you ask the God and say how you really going to be a real man and you're looking at 5 to 10 and he says you come here and you tell me you look you love God and you still won't get into the service it was a guy one time we preaching he said Brother Kyle he said he sto service he said I do not have the Holy Ghost and I said how many times you've been in a church and now you see people that you know they don't have the Holy Spirit and they in and out of the church they up and down and you can watch their spirit and know that something's not right but yet they saying when I get things together and I ask you God is not looking for you to get nothing together all he wants you to do is stand that will spit on your eyes cuz see he said humble yourself first and you see see before God could deal with Moses he had to first take off his shoes God didn't speak speak to him until first he turned aside to see what God had done so he had to Humble himself from the wisdom of Egypt to see a burning bush amen and the burning bush maybe was this big and I want you to think about it God when he saw that now he turned aside to see the bush amen then he started deal amen now think about this brother R this man he's having his burning bush experience and he's standing in front of the Alpha and Omega yeah and he's speaking directly to him and he tells him he says huh I'mma put my hands on I put my hands on you I want to pray and as he laid his hands on him he takes them off and he ask the man he says do you see anything and the man he start he opens his eyes and for the first time he sees something out of his pupil now think about this now yes but it was still spit hanging there it was still dust on his cloth he still walked a good journey but when his eyes was open Jesus comes he says what do you see and he said I see men walking like trees now think about this now Jesus Is God manifested In the Flesh he laid his hand on him he spinned his eyes he had done everything for the situation but yet the man saw men like trees sometimes your first experience you didn't go all the way with God yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and you see this particular man he said even though he had been touched the situation had not yet been rectified I hope you see this this morning and so now I want you to look now think about anything you have on your heart anything that you want to bring before God this morning amen amen now this morning let God lay his hands on amen amen let God spit in your eyes Hallelujah let God spit on the situation he didn't spit on his leg he didn't spit on his head he didn't spit on the ear he spit on the situation so God something had to come out of God's mouth amen and what he spew was something that was hot oh Lord I hope you see this this morning amen and what came out went directly to the individual this morning this is not a group of fair you say I can see you can come and you see well these people were praising the Lord this side wasn't these people you see it's an individual that's right now I want you to see this now my brother my sister if God could have Way start moving on your situation would you praise him if God if God could just come by your door yeah and he can look down in your bank account amen and he can look and see that you have a monetary issue I'm saying would it hurt to let God put $5 in there even though you need 10 now think about this now would you let God put five in and if he put five would you give God praise for five come come on somebody come on now you see but you see God don't halfway do nothing and you see I want you to see this morning that some of you need a second touch and what God was doing to this man he would not let him leave with a halfway touch God would not let his bride not be perfect he said I'm coming for a bride without spot without blemish and won't have one wrinkle so the word that God gives us is so perfect that now it comes and it changes you from the inside out but will you give God praise for it let them put five in your biger account I want you to think about something it ain't a man that won't come to my house and you say I'm going to put something on it you ain't going to say thank you amen but you see here you may not be letting God take the second touch amen so what happens he's standing here he knows he's not seeing everything clearly so God wants all of us to see things clearly amen so this man is still sitting here and he speaks to him brother kid and he ask him what do you see now it's based on your testimony this morning amen how do you see the word where are you standing today you say what do you need from God what what's bothering you I want you to think about this now you say let him spit and touch it and he's going to ask you has the situation changed when he asked this man he said I see men like trees everything wasn't clear now Jesus don't leave the man don't leave so you see it's a faith there it's something moving like a magnet and it's pulling everything there now brother we sing this song the power of God is moving just like a

the seven SE we got a church we got all of that man now I'm I'm trying to tell I'm trying to tell you this now but I'm asking you but why you ain't rejoicing you say if you go to jail you still get the word Lord glory to God if you go to jail he said Lo I'll be with you he said even in you to the End of Time amen so now he's trying to tell you that I want to now comfort you I want to show you that I have a word for your day but I'm asking you this now he say in heaven it's going to be rejoicing in heaven he say it's going to be pra but B said it'll be the loudest place that you ever be he said because wherever Jesus Christ is there a bunch of noise so now I asked the guys so I said I said man look let me tell you when I go into this classroom on the back of the classroom I go I go in the in the jail so where everybody sleep and it's maybe maybe like a little bit double this size and on the back here back on this wall when I went into this room first time I looked up and it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen I said like Lord did you put that in for me now think of this Hebrews 13 a big old green sign I've been to the chapel I've been other ain't nowhere else but in this room and it's called the faith D amen and I want you to think about this now I'm asking you you say if you love the Lord don't you see as time is winding up he said that now there will be those that will be bundled in and bundled out Lord I don't know maybe we go to that tonight we're talking about how the Antichrist spirit is coming this last week and I want you to see that you see all these different spirits and you ask now when we come to the house of God you say is right now is everybody in One Accord is everybody seeing what God wants you to see in his word does everybody want God to remove any condition so that they can walk before him holy blameless without spot now look at this I'm keep reading after he put his hands again upon him his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and then he saw every man clearly amen so the second time all he did was he had to put his hand on Amen now I'm asking you this is it took a second touch now I asked you this morning could anybody use a second touch I'm asking you see you see oh I hope you see it this morning y'all I'm talking about he said a second touch now the touch can only be done by Jesus a man can't touch you but I'm asking you if Jesus you let Jesus touch you if you let Jesus come down and touch your eyes he said touch whatever situation because he said let me touch it again if God can move the if he did the first time then now he only wants to bring it so it can be perfect now I only ask you this in the end time now all the promise he said that the faith your faith in God will unlock every promise that God already did for you on Calvary and I want you to see this today you see I'm seeing many that are going cold you see many families that are going through many problems you see many issues they come up and down why because you say we're grieving God and you see The Grieving of God is because we don't give him everything when you give God everything all he can do if he said you go one mile with a man he said I'll go twice with you and I want you to see brother books he said sometimes no he said I've seen guys grew up in the message Hallelujah and seen God no God's in jail today slung drugs I remember had a guy was when I was in Atlanta I'mma tell you something I'm talking about a real touch had a guy put a gun on my lap and tell me shoot this man rob him right here and I want you to see I know the message and I'm 17 18 No 19 at the time and you know the word but the devil wants to sift you for a reason and I've seen the same kids they come in and out of church and they don't have a real experience and now you're sitting in between a high place and a point I want you I don't know why I don't know why this come to my mind sitting on I 20 pull over wake up fell asleep in the car I'm in college I'm at Georgia Tech studying electrical engineering I fall asleep in the car the guy got several pounds of weed in the trunk and I wake up and all I see it blue lights
