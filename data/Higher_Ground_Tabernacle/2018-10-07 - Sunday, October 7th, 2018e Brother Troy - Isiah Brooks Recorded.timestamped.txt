[29:18] name Amen
[29:20] I'm here to meet with him hey red I'm
[29:23] here to hear what he would say unto me
[29:24] and I never come to those curtains but
[29:27] what I come through with a purpose a
[29:29] meant to meet with him face to face to
[29:32] hear what he would say to me hey man
[29:35] let's just open in our Bibles to the
[29:38] book of first Kings chapter 1 I've
[29:43] preached from the scripture a long long
[29:45] time ago and I just wanted to revisit it
[29:51] this scripture is just it's an amazing
[29:54] one to me because it has to do with who
[29:58] is king over your life amen and that's
[30:01] what I want to say that I'll be the
[30:03] title for the scene Eunice who is king
[30:05] over your life Amen because no matter
[30:10] what we got to make it plain a
[30:14] we got to make it clear so they all know
[30:17] who is king over our lives amen
[30:21] so first kings chapter 1 we'll start
[30:25] with the fifth verse King David had 19
[30:29] sons amen
[30:32] and he promised unto Bathsheba speaking
[30:37] by permission by Jehovah himself that
[30:41] Solomon would reign after David said
[30:47] amen and God had told King David by by
[30:52] the Prophet Nathan that David's son
[30:58] would build the temple because David
[31:01] would not be able to build it
[31:03] amen so so but but in first Kings
[31:06] chapter 1 it's an era has seen thing
[31:08] that somehow somehow in the kingdom that
[31:13] there was room for another one of
[31:15] David's sons to rise up and declare
[31:19] themselves to be king instead of Solomon
[31:22] amen amen I don't know how it happened
[31:26] it should not have happened this way
[31:28] amen it should not have happened this
[31:30] way let's go ahead and read through it
[31:32] first Kings chapter 1 we'll start with
[31:34] the fifth verse and this is speaking of
[31:40] David's son a torneio says then add an
[31:44] ayah the son of hagas exalted himself
[31:47] saying I will be king he prepared
[31:51] himself chariots and horsemen and fifty
[31:53] men to run before him and his father
[31:55] that's David had not displeased them at
[31:58] any time in saying why hast thou done so
[32:01] and also he was a fairly goodly man and
[32:05] his mother bear him after Absalom he
[32:09] confirmed with Joab that's the the
[32:12] commander of David's army the son of
[32:13] Zechariah and with a BA thar the priest
[32:16] that's one of the men that bore the Ark
[32:18] of the Covenant and they followed a
[32:21] danaiah and helped him but
[32:25] knock the priest and benaiah the son of
[32:28] jehoiada and nathan the prophet and
[32:31] shimai and rey and the mighty men which
[32:33] belong to david were not with a Tenaya
[32:37] and a danaiah slew sheep and oxen and
[32:41] fat cattle by the stone of xoauth which
[32:43] is by in regal and he called all of his
[32:46] brethren the king's sons and all the men
[32:48] of judah the king's servants but nathan
[32:51] the prophet and benaiah and the mighty
[32:54] men and Solomon his brother he called
[32:57] none where for Nathan spake unto
[33:00] Bathsheba the mother of Solomon saying
[33:02] hast thou not hurt that Aniyah the son
[33:06] of hagas death reigned and david our
[33:08] lord knoweth it not a malicious bow our
[33:12] heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father
[33:15] we just want to thank you Lord for this
[33:17] word Lord we pray that right now in the
[33:19] name of Jesus Christ that you would make
[33:21] it plain to us Lord and you speak to us
[33:23] exactly in a way Lord that we need to
[33:25] hear this evening father
[33:27] Lord that it might be plain Loretha who
[33:29] is king over our lives and we just
[33:31] dedicate this service into your name
[33:34] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[33:36] amen amen you can you can be seated
[33:42] so David as he was kind of in his Middle
[33:48] Ages you know he bore two sons Absalom
[33:52] and this Adonai ABAI one of his wives
[33:55] called hagas and you know the story of
[33:58] how Absalom and rose up and tried to
[34:00] have David removed from the throne and
[34:02] and when David was leaving Jerusalem
[34:06] being kicked out of his own kingdom that
[34:08] two of the priests got decided well if
[34:11] David's leaving the kingdom we're going
[34:13] to take the Ark of the Covenant with us
[34:15] because if the king is leaving Jerusalem
[34:18] then we're going to take the ark with us
[34:20] and so the tzaddik that we mentioned
[34:23] here and and the other priests that
[34:27] followed along with the son had an ayah
[34:30] they twit and they took the Ark of the
[34:31] Covenant a few other priests and they
[34:33] left Jerusalem and when as David was
[34:36] leaving Jerusalem being kicked
[34:38] out of Jerusalem being kicked out of his
[34:41] own position as being King by his son
[34:43] Absalom but but when he saw the Ark of
[34:46] the Covenant leaving Jerusalem he looked
[34:48] back and he said to those priests he
[34:50] said he said don't let the Ark of the
[34:54] Covenant leave Jerusalem take it back to
[34:57] where it belongs and if the Lord be
[34:59] pleased with me he will make me and
[35:02] reinstate me as king amen but if the
[35:05] Lord has not pleased with me he will not
[35:07] let me be rejoined with Ark of the
[35:08] Covenant again hey man that was the
[35:10] confidence that David had in his God
[35:14] that he knew that he was linked with the
[35:17] Ark of the Covenant amen he David knew
[35:20] who he was
[35:21] amen he knew that he was king over
[35:23] Israel he knew that God had chosen him
[35:26] he knew that he had a divine commission
[35:28] to be who he was in his exact station
[35:31] and none there's nothing that man could
[35:33] do to hinder him from being while he was
[35:35] supposed to be amen so when he so when
[35:38] his own son Absalom rose up and tried to
[35:41] remove his dad from being King and David
[35:45] was being was fleeing his own throne was
[35:49] fleeing his own capital city that when
[35:51] the priests decided to take the arm of
[35:53] the Ark of the Covenant and follow him
[35:54] out of the city
[35:55] that David looked back and had such a
[35:57] confidence that God would restore him
[36:00] back to the kingship that he said make
[36:03] sure the Ark of the Covenant stays this
[36:05] place if God be pleased with me he will
[36:08] bring me back to his presence amen
[36:11] because you know we all get to those
[36:12] points in our lives where where we don't
[36:15] know what's going on or we get we get
[36:17] maybe a little bit frustrated or a
[36:19] little bit troubled you know and maybe
[36:20] it feels like the the presence of God is
[36:23] separate us from a season you know but
[36:25] but you know though matter what we have
[36:27] we know who we are
[36:28] amen we know who we are we know that God
[36:32] chose us and not going that but God
[36:34] chose us for the day that we're living
[36:36] in amen and it was God it wasn't someone
[36:39] else called us in placed us here it
[36:41] wasn't that any man could place us where
[36:43] we are but God Himself drew us called us
[36:47] by our name filled us with the Holy
[36:50] Ghost and placed us right here in this
[36:52] church
[36:52] amen so even if we don't necessarily
[36:54] feel the presence of the Lord we know
[36:57] that we cannot be separated from a man
[37:00] no matter where we are in life's journey
[37:02] we have that confidence with God where
[37:04] he said I will never leave you nor
[37:06] forsake you by all I will always be with
[37:09] you even until the end of the age Amen
[37:11] we have that as a prophet as a promise
[37:14] no matter what our flesh testifies
[37:16] sometimes what are mine testify
[37:17] sometimes we have that as a promise and
[37:20] David had that same promise
[37:21] Amen because the Bible says that when he
[37:23] was anointed with the oil that the Holy
[37:26] Spirit of God was with them the rest of
[37:28] the days of his life amen so he said let
[37:31] the ark go back God will let it be where
[37:34] it's supposed to be because God will
[37:35] make sure that I am going to be where
[37:38] I'm supposed to be amen so every point
[37:41] of our life God is going to make sure
[37:43] that were where we're supposed to be
[37:45] amen there's no reason to get frustrated
[37:47] a man there's no reason to worry
[37:49] amen everything's running right on time
[37:52] amen God has a plan Amen God has a
[37:55] purpose a man he foreordained our walk
[37:58] before the foundation of the world amen
[38:01] and our trials were forward aim before
[38:03] the foundation of the world amen and so
[38:06] we have placed our entire trusting God
[38:09] and we have acknowledged him that he is
[38:12] the king of our lives he has responded
[38:14] that we were baptized in his name and he
[38:17] brought the evidence back filled us with
[38:19] this Holy Ghost and here we stand filled
[38:23] with the Holy Spirit and we are the
[38:24] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he is the
[38:26] king of our life amen and we got to
[38:30] glorify Him as king amen we got to
[38:32] acknowledge him that he is the key
[38:35] payment but somehow in as time went on
[38:39] that as as when when David's two sons
[38:45] Absalom and a denial were growing up
[38:48] that God or that David received a
[38:51] promise that one of your sons will be
[38:54] heir on your throne after you amen and
[38:59] that son will build the temple and then
[39:02] God went back and he revealed unto David
[39:05] that
[39:05] that son was gonna be Solomon who was
[39:08] born later amen that that son would be
[39:11] Solomon so as David is getting older
[39:14] somehow that was not expressed strong
[39:20] enough and there was room in the kingdom
[39:23] for another man toward another one of
[39:26] David's sons to rise up and declare
[39:27] himself to be king payment so I just
[39:30] want to read a little bit further into
[39:31] this story here let's go to let's go
[39:33] back to first Kings chapter 1 and we'll
[39:40] go ahead and read from the 39th first
[39:42] but before that Bathsheba she goes into
[39:44] the King and she tells King David what's
[39:47] going on and and because she's concerned
[39:49] that David doesn't realize what's Dave's
[39:51] getting old he doesn't know what's going
[39:53] on his own kingdom and when she
[39:55] expresses to him she says didn't you
[39:57] promise me by the name of Jehovah that
[40:01] my son Solomon would be king after you
[40:03] how is it now that this man this that
[40:07] Solomon's brother at ania is now
[40:09] proclaiming himself to be king a mess
[40:12] let's read from verse 39 of the first
[40:15] chapter and zatox was there these are
[40:21] now operating by David's instructions
[40:23] here it says and Zadok the priest took a
[40:25] Horn of oil out of the tabernacle and
[40:28] anointed Solomon and they blew the
[40:31] trumpet and all the people said god save
[40:35] King Solomon and all the people came up
[40:37] after him and the people piped with
[40:40] pipes and rejoiced with great joy so
[40:43] that the earth rent with the sound of
[40:44] them now what's going on this is right
[40:47] in the middle of adonai ahead all the
[40:49] men together with them he's gathered up
[40:51] all of his everybody he could find there
[40:54] would be an agreement with him Amen he
[40:56] didn't call the Prophet because he knew
[40:58] the Prophet wouldn't agree with what he
[41:00] was doing a man he didn't call the
[41:02] captain of the army because he knew the
[41:03] captain of David's army wouldn't agree
[41:05] with them they called he went didn't
[41:07] call Solomon he didn't call Bathsheba a
[41:10] man because he knew that they would not
[41:12] be an agree with them but he found men
[41:14] that didn't know the promise of God for
[41:17] that day and he
[41:19] got those to agree with them you see the
[41:23] ones that didn't know the God's promise
[41:26] for that day were the ones that were
[41:28] able to be swayed by so so he goes and
[41:33] he gets he goes he gets some of their
[41:35] army they'll go with him they didn't
[41:36] know the promise he found a couple
[41:38] priests that didn't know the promise he
[41:40] found a a few other men didn't know the
[41:44] promise but he couldn't get any of the
[41:45] mighty men to come because they knew the
[41:47] promise a man and what he does is he
[41:49] gathered them a big entourage and they
[41:52] marched into this feast room and they
[41:55] killed the fattened calf and they threw
[41:58] a grand party and adonai arose up and
[42:01] gave a great speech about how God seen
[42:03] Jehovah has or now ordained me to be
[42:06] king instead of David and he proclaimed
[42:10] and said I am now king amen so a think
[42:14] about his name said Jehovah his name
[42:17] meant the Lord is Jehovah Jehovah is
[42:20] Lord that's what the name Adonai amines
[42:22] you can almost hear his speech now where
[42:24] he's saying you know does this seem good
[42:26] that God our Jehovah our Father a seen
[42:29] fit to establish me who is whose very
[42:32] name means the Lord Java is Lord you
[42:35] know and you know you can imagine the
[42:37] speech that he would have given but in
[42:39] the midst of this feast is in the midst
[42:43] of this party the very midst of this
[42:47] party they're having a celebration
[42:49] they're having a good time they're all
[42:51] rejoicing over the new king at ania amen
[42:55] and all of a sudden they begin to hear a
[42:57] noise and they begin to hear this noise
[43:01] and they want to know what and everybody
[43:03] is thinking what is going on and over
[43:07] just a few blocks away the emissaries of
[43:10] Solomon are coming marching into town
[43:11] yeah the true king over Israel let's
[43:15] read that again from verse 39 says and
[43:18] Zadok the priest took a Horn of oil out
[43:21] of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon
[43:23] and they blew the trumpet and all the
[43:26] people said god save King Solomon and
[43:28] all the people came up after him and the
[43:30] people piped with pipes and rejoiced
[43:32] with great joy
[43:33] so the earth writ with the sound of them
[43:35] and a danaiah and all the guests were
[43:37] that were with him heard it as they are
[43:39] made an end of eating and when Joab
[43:42] heard the sound of the trumpet he said
[43:44] wherefore is this noise of the city
[43:47] being an uproar and while he yet spake
[43:49] behold Johnson the son of a birth are
[43:52] the priests King and I Anaya said unto
[43:54] him come in Flour a valiant man and
[43:58] bring us good tidings and John as an
[44:01] answer and said a danaiah verily our
[44:03] Lord King David has made Solomon King
[44:08] now the party is coming to an abrupt
[44:11] stop
[44:12] amen amen let's keep reading here amen
[44:16] and the King has sent him with him Zadok
[44:19] the priest and Nathan the prophet and
[44:21] Bera and i--i the son of jehoiada Terah
[44:24] thights and the fellow fights and they
[44:26] have caused him to ride upon the Kings
[44:28] mule and the Zadok the priest and Nathan
[44:31] the prophet have anointed him King in
[44:33] jehan and they are come up from thence
[44:35] rejoicing so the city rang again this is
[44:39] the noise which he have heard and also
[44:42] Solomon sitteth on the throne of the
[44:44] kingdom moreover the Kings servants came
[44:46] to bless our Lord King David saying God
[44:48] make the name of Solomon better than thy
[44:50] name and God make his throne greater
[44:53] than I throne and the King bowed himself
[44:55] upon the bed and also the thus saith the
[44:59] looking blessed be the Lord God of
[45:01] Israel which has given me one to sit on
[45:03] the throne this day my eyes even seen it
[45:06] now watched verse 49 and all the guests
[45:10] that were without an ayah were afraid
[45:13] and rose up and went every man his way
[45:17] and a don't I have feared because of
[45:19] Solomon and arose and went and cut hold
[45:21] of the horns of the altar he was looking
[45:24] for mercy
[45:25] Amen all the guests in that party were
[45:28] suddenly afraid
[45:30] yo that's going to happen again one of
[45:32] these days that's going to happen again
[45:35] one of these days there are a lot of
[45:36] people in this world to have chosen who
[45:39] they believe escaped amen everybody's
[45:42] done it everybody on this planet has
[45:45] chosen someone that they believe
[45:47] this King or something something over
[45:49] their life this is the direction of my
[45:51] life this is what's going to rain from
[45:53] my life like the like the the man that
[45:56] brother man talk about who had that sign
[45:58] on his shirt I am a fool for Christ and
[46:00] then we went by he saw in the back of a
[46:02] sure he said whose fool are you
[46:04] everybody's going to worship someone
[46:07] everybody's gonna worship something and
[46:09] the reason what what really gets my mind
[46:12] thinking about this is how is it
[46:14] possible that in the midst of just a few
[46:19] miles from Jerusalem that somehow a
[46:23] danaiah had an opportunity together that
[46:27] many people around him even to the upper
[46:31] people like Joab of the army the captain
[46:35] of the host of the army and different
[46:37] ones and some of the priests that bore
[46:39] the Ark of the Covenant always how did
[46:41] he convince all these people but somehow
[46:44] what God's promised for that day it was
[46:47] not clear enough that they didn't know
[46:50] who was supposed to be king
[46:52] amen and sometimes I think about our own
[46:54] stuff do we know who ought to be king
[46:56] over our lives amen
[46:59] do our actions prove that we know who
[47:03] ought to be king of our lives there are
[47:05] things that we say and do prove that we
[47:08] know who ought to be king over our life
[47:10] amen are we are our actions bearing
[47:13] testimony that we know the promise of
[47:15] God for this hour
[47:16] hey man do we really are we really
[47:18] testifying that that God is king Amen is
[47:22] our life telling about that hey man
[47:24] think about the time of Esther Amen you
[47:27] know you remember the story of Esther
[47:28] you know she was they had the King as
[47:32] earth and his Queen was Vashti Amen and
[47:37] King Azeris said I'm gonna throw me a
[47:39] feast for a hundred and eighty days and
[47:42] I'm going to show I'm gonna bring
[47:44] together all my Lords and governors from
[47:46] all across the land and gather them
[47:48] together here in the capital city and
[47:50] I'm gonna spend a hundred and eighty
[47:51] days declaring who great my kingdom is
[47:55] and all the glories of it and at the end
[47:58] of his of
[47:59] his hundred eighty day feast he decided
[48:02] to top it all off with showing off the
[48:04] greatest glory of his kingdom which was
[48:06] bash T and when he said I'm gonna spend
[48:10] seven days showing the the glory of my
[48:13] Queen Vashti and he when he called for
[48:16] her that the whole time he found out
[48:18] that the whole time he had this 180 day
[48:20] feast that she had a parallel feast
[48:23] going on up in her chamber
[48:28] she had a parallel feast the King was
[48:31] down here having his feast and Vashti
[48:34] was up here having her own feast and
[48:37] somehow in vast she's feast it got this
[48:41] thing as fervor came up in their minds
[48:44] that she was so so great and she'd
[48:49] glorify her own self that even when the
[48:51] King called for her to come that she
[48:53] thought the her feast was somehow
[48:55] greater than the Kings feasts and she
[48:59] decided not to come amen
[49:02] so in when King Azura saw that his wife
[49:05] was had her own church service going on
[49:09] amen and she had her as she was up there
[49:11] having her own church service or having
[49:14] her own worship service Amen glorifying
[49:17] something other than the king Amen not
[49:20] glorifying the king that that somehow
[49:23] whatever that whatever songs they were
[49:25] singing in that worship service we're
[49:28] not bringing glory to God we're not
[49:30] bringing glory to the king amen and so
[49:32] when the King called for her to come and
[49:36] serve him her mind was not even on the
[49:40] same level of what the Kings mind and
[49:43] what happened she was sent and she was
[49:45] cast out into outer darkness why because
[49:49] her mind hurt her motives her objectives
[49:52] were not the Kings moaning and echoes
[49:54] she was part of a different feast than
[49:58] the Kings feast a man saw God you he
[50:01] where he rose up Esther to be queen in
[50:04] bath she's dead because she knew how to
[50:06] bring glory to the king
[50:09] Amen let's let's turn over to Romans
[50:15] chapter 1 glorifying him as God our
[50:24] brother Isiah preached message several
[50:29] years ago called glorify Him as God and
[50:31] that's where I got this this verse from
[50:37] Amen Romans 1 verse 21 it says because
[50:44] that when they knew God they glorified
[50:47] him not as God neither were they
[50:51] thankful but came became vain in their
[50:55] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[50:58] darkened professing themselves to be
[51:00] wise they became fools amen he's talking
[51:04] about people that know God people that
[51:06] knew God but somehow their knowledge of
[51:09] a God did not allow them to glorify God
[51:12] as God a man now God is the all-powerful
[51:15] creator of the heavens and the earth
[51:17] maybe our minds don't actually sometimes
[51:19] quite grasp who God is but he is a much
[51:23] greater being than we can even imagine a
[51:25] man he is a much bigger being than we
[51:27] can imagine
[51:28] a man when we get stuck in our
[51:30] day-to-day lives we sometimes we don't
[51:32] quite glorify him the way that we ought
[51:34] to and we don't realize the position
[51:36] that we have been given as the as the
[51:40] Queen as you know as Queen Esther amen
[51:42] amen as the bride of Lord Jesus Christ
[51:45] amen do you realize what that means
[51:47] amen when you think of how great the
[51:50] heavens are how far it is how far can
[51:52] way are those stars amen you know who
[51:56] created Mars who created Jupiter who
[51:59] created all these planets where did all
[52:01] this come from why is this earth covered
[52:03] with life why is it that when I go
[52:06] 10,000 feet deep in the ocean you can
[52:08] find lot I mean why is it their way you
[52:10] go to the top of the highest mountain
[52:11] there's something why is it that even in
[52:14] the desert there's something living
[52:16] there why is it in the forest they're
[52:18] filled with life why is there life
[52:20] everywhere in this plan
[52:22] because there's a living God that has
[52:24] taken interest in this planet amen and
[52:27] he has chosen us to be his bride amen
[52:31] oh we ought to glorify Him as God hey
[52:34] man you remember how in uh in Daniel in
[52:36] the Book of Daniel when King
[52:38] Belteshazzar Amen they had they had
[52:42] taken over Jerusalem
[52:44] King Nebuchadnezzar a man they took over
[52:47] Jerusalem they took all of the all of
[52:50] the ornaments and all of the gold out of
[52:54] the temple of Jehovah and they carried
[52:57] it on carts all the way to Babylon five
[53:00] hundred miles away and now all of the
[53:02] things that Solomon had created to serve
[53:05] the temple now four hundred years later
[53:07] are on the back of a cart heading
[53:09] towards Babylon you know and and
[53:13] Nebuchadnezzar his son or grandson now
[53:15] comes upon the throne he's throwing a
[53:18] feast again there's another feast
[53:21] through we had the feast of a tonight we
[53:25] had the feast of king of Zeus and Vashti
[53:27] now we have the feast of belteshazzar
[53:30] and keep the beltasar decides to throw a
[53:33] feast I need a size to use for his food
[53:36] service items for this feast to go down
[53:39] and get the vessels from Jerusalem from
[53:42] the God Jehovah that they had conquered
[53:44] and as he goes and he has this drunken
[53:47] feast and Babylon as they gather
[53:49] together all the all the elements for
[53:51] the sacrifices all the elements for the
[53:53] drinking and the communion and all the
[53:55] things they were meant to be for the
[53:58] high priests of sacrifice unto Jehovah
[54:01] now to be on this drunken feasts of King
[54:03] Belshazzar that in the midst of that
[54:06] feast all sudden this hand appears in
[54:08] midair and begins writing on the wall
[54:11] many many up Hazel Tarkin
[54:14] and and the King Belteshazzar he he
[54:18] looks at that and he's his knees start
[54:21] trembling his legs started knocking
[54:22] together you know and he's he wants to
[54:24] know what is this hand that is writing
[54:27] on the wall and what does it mean and
[54:30] Daniel was brought in to interpret the
[54:32] writing on the wall and he says you have
[54:35] been weighed in the back
[54:36] and you've been found wanting in the
[54:40] middle of the feast a sudden fear came
[54:42] upon amen now think about it a denial
[54:47] was in the middle of his feast and they
[54:49] heard the noise and a sudden fear came
[54:52] upon them the real king was being shown
[54:58] Queen Vashti was in the middle of her
[55:01] feast and a sudden fear came over her
[55:04] when the soldiers came and cast her in
[55:07] outer darkness amen
[55:09] King Belshazzar II a hand shows up
[55:13] without a body and starts riding on the
[55:16] wall and he's a sudden fear the music
[55:19] stopped amen the party ceased no one
[55:24] took another drink and he wanted to know
[55:26] what is going on and all of a sudden as
[55:29] the interpretation goes out they began
[55:32] to hear the banging on the walls as the
[55:34] as the neighboring int as the enemy's
[55:36] armies were banging on the gates of the
[55:39] city and as soon as the prophecy went
[55:42] out and was interpreted that this night
[55:45] you shall be slain amen and that man was
[55:49] slain that king he thought he knew who
[55:51] he was he thought he knew he thought he
[55:54] was safe where he was but in the midst
[55:57] of another feast again as they were
[56:00] feasting they became suddenly afraid a
[56:03] danaiah and a feast became afraid Vashti
[56:07] in the middle of a feast became afraid
[56:09] and now what King Belshazzar in the
[56:13] middle of a feast became free why
[56:15] because they did they knew God they knew
[56:18] a God they glorified different things as
[56:21] God but they didn't know the one true
[56:24] God amen and as we said there in Romans
[56:26] 1:21 it says but because when they knew
[56:30] God they glorified him not as God
[56:34] neither were they thankful but became
[56:37] vain in their imaginations and their
[56:40] foolish heart was darkened why because
[56:43] they knew who he was why because we can
[56:46] see his life all over this planet
[56:49] someone has planted life all over this
[56:52] planet this entire planet has been
[56:56] covered in life where do they come from
[56:58] as you know I as I I'll never forget
[57:02] this thing I heard a long time it goes
[57:04] you know they got that organization
[57:05] called SETI that they have these radio
[57:08] towers that are searching the Stars
[57:10] waiting for some signal to come from a
[57:12] alien race out there and they're and
[57:15] they're saying if they can just find a
[57:17] radio signal coming from the heavens
[57:19] that they'll know that there's life and
[57:21] some other planet but yeah if you take a
[57:24] microscope and you examine the cells and
[57:28] you see the DNA of every creature and
[57:30] you can't even tell that there is your
[57:33] signal right there a man that someone
[57:35] put their signal down into the deepest
[57:38] depths of the ocean so we'll put their
[57:40] signal on the top of every mountain a
[57:42] man in the middle of every desert in the
[57:44] middle of the rainforest in the middle
[57:45] of us say man there is a signal the DNA
[57:48] of God when God spoke let there be
[57:51] let there be let there be a mint the
[57:54] signal is there God is a lot amen amen
[57:57] like we said this morning you know God
[58:00] when he when he quit his when he put his
[58:02] word a mint when he went we went to
[58:05] create the heavens and the earth he
[58:08] spoke he and speak to the plants to
[58:11] raise up the plants he spoke to the dirt
[58:14] he told the dirt bring up the plants he
[58:17] put his word into the earth and the
[58:20] earth brought forth exactly what was
[58:21] supposed to be a man when he wanted to
[58:23] create the fish
[58:24] he put his word in the water and let the
[58:27] water bring forth the fish he meant when
[58:30] he wanted to create a bride a husband
[58:32] and a wife a man after his own image he
[58:34] spoke to himself let us let us bring
[58:39] forth man and rose so what happens when
[58:41] you take the fish out of the water he
[58:45] dies when you take the tree out of the
[58:47] out of the dirt it dies if we take the
[58:50] man out of God what happens he dies amen
[58:53] amen so so now this is three feasts that
[58:58] we mentioned where they were worshiping
[59:02] their own
[59:05] worshiping their own thoughts and then
[59:07] suddenly a fear came over them when the
[59:10] true Creon was revealed lesser to
[59:14] revelations chapter 18
[59:43] amen rub
[59:44] she's 18 verse 2 it says and he cried
[59:48] mightily with a strong voice saying
[59:50] Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen
[59:52] and has become a habitation of devils
[59:54] and the hold of every foul spirit and a
[59:57] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[59:59] for the nations have drunk of the wine
[1:00:02] of the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:00:04] kings of the earth have committed
[1:00:06] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:00:08] of the earth are waxed rich through
[1:00:09] their abundance of her delicacies what's
[1:00:13] happening again it's another feast again
[1:00:16] this whole world is feasting again yes
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] it's just the same as same as the feasts
[1:00:24] of Belteshazzar it's the same as the
[1:00:26] feast of a sh t they are rejoicing they
[1:00:29] think they know who the god of their
[1:00:31] life is but in the midst of this feast
[1:00:33] the real God is gonna be exposed as
[1:00:35] gonna be revealed amen
[1:00:37] God will be revealed as the king over
[1:00:39] this earth it will be revealed in our
[1:00:41] day who the creator of the heavens and
[1:00:44] the earth is amen
[1:00:46] it will be revealed in our day who
[1:00:49] created the heavens and the earth yes
[1:00:52] and then some will go into everlasting
[1:00:55] torment a meant a sudden fear will come
[1:00:58] over them you know when the rapture
[1:01:00] takes place let's turn over to
[1:01:09] Luke 22 actually while we're right here
[1:01:11] when the rapture takes place I'm gonna
[1:01:16] be excited
[1:01:17] amen
[1:01:36] hey man Luke 22 verse 10 and says Jesus
[1:01:42] said and he said unto them behold when
[1:01:45] ye are entered into the city there shall
[1:01:48] a man meet you bearing a pitcher of
[1:01:51] water follow him into the house where he
[1:01:53] entered a thin and ye shall say unto the
[1:01:56] Goodman of the house the master saith
[1:01:59] unto thee where is the guest chamber
[1:02:00] where I shall eat the Passover with my
[1:02:02] disciples and he shall show you a large
[1:02:05] upper room furnished as their make ready
[1:02:07] and they went and they found as he had
[1:02:10] said unto them and they made ready for
[1:02:12] the Passover and when the hour was come
[1:02:15] he sat down in the twelve apostles with
[1:02:17] him and he said unto them with desire I
[1:02:20] have desired to eat this Passover with

[1:02:36] yourselves for I say unto you I will not
[1:02:38] drink of the fruit of the vine until the
[1:02:40] kingdom of God shall come amen

[1:02:50] disciples they had their feast and his
[1:02:53] cycles were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:02:55] we've been filled with the Holy Ghost we
[1:02:57] are waiting for this feast to come again
[1:02:59] Amen we are gonna feasts with him I mean
[1:03:02] I think about the whole world it's going

[1:03:18] the the the plenty of money floating
[1:03:20] around you know that people are
[1:03:23] comfortable even the poorest people in
[1:03:25] our land or living pretty comfortable
[1:03:27] you know you think about how the poor
[1:03:29] were 500 years ago compared to the poor
[1:03:32] today you know the the whole world is
[1:03:36] feasting the whole world is feasting and
[1:03:39] they're there marching towards an event
[1:03:43] that's been prophesied but they have no
[1:03:46] knowledge of it just like in King ad and
[1:03:48] ayah or when we'd had an Iowa
[1:03:50] is rising up and proclaiming I am gonna
[1:03:53] be king over Jerusalem he didn't realize
[1:03:55] the prophecy had already gone out that
[1:03:57] his brother Salman was gonna be king but
[1:03:59] because of a lack of knowledge of the
[1:04:01] prophecy he set himself up for failure
[1:04:05] and when he was in the midst of the
[1:04:08] midst of of enjoying the fruits of his
[1:04:11] of his thoughts amen
[1:04:14] he had worked up this this thing in his
[1:04:17] mind and had worshiped this idea in his
[1:04:20] mind that Aniyah could be king i could
[1:04:22] be king I can write my father David he
[1:04:25] was a great king and now when my father
[1:04:28] Devi is growing old he's getting ready
[1:04:30] to die and now III Aaron ayah will be
[1:04:33] king in my father's stead but not
[1:04:35] knowing he worshiped this idea in his
[1:04:37] mind so strongly until he got to the
[1:04:41] point they could not accept that the
[1:04:43] prophecy of God cannot be failed okay
[1:04:45] not shot a man so is it already the
[1:04:48] prophecy of God this it's gonna come to
[1:04:50] pass
[1:04:50] amen there in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:04:53] an eye we're going to be changed
[1:04:55] amen there that now as much people can
[1:04:58] feast all they want to they can feast on
[1:05:00] the things of the world
[1:05:01] amen they can feast on the on the the
[1:05:04] foolishness of of this world but no the
[1:05:07] prophecy is still true amen
[1:05:10] it doesn't matter how much how much you
[1:05:12] work it up in your mind if you go into
[1:05:15] that direction there will come a date
[1:05:17] we're in the midst of your comfort there
[1:05:19] will be a sudden fear you'll come upon a
[1:05:21] mint why because the real king will be
[1:05:24] made known
[1:05:27] amen amen like we said this morning you
[1:05:30] know that with the brooding of the Holy
[1:05:32] Spirit the Holy Spirit was brooding back
[1:05:34] in the in the beginning amen and what
[1:05:38] was he doing he's still brooding today a
[1:05:40] man the Holy Spirit was brooding in the
[1:05:42] days of Noah look he what was he looking
[1:05:44] for he's looking for a place to rest
[1:05:46] amen they saw in the day in the days of
[1:05:49] the creation the Holy Spirit brooded
[1:05:51] over the face of the earth way till he
[1:05:53] called the earth come on amen in the
[1:05:55] days of Noah the whole the dove was
[1:05:58] brooding over the waters what to do it
[1:06:00] was looking for a place to rest
[1:06:01] amen so I went back to where I could
[1:06:03] rest and
[1:06:04] well a man when John the Baptist was was
[1:06:07] was the voice taught talking to him said
[1:06:10] the one that you see the Holy Spirit
[1:06:12] resting on and remaining on that is the
[1:06:16] Son of God amen and so it's not the one
[1:06:19] that the Holy Spirit comes and goes it's
[1:06:22] not the one that has can just rejoice
[1:06:25] bus one that the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:06:27] on and remains on a mint that's where
[1:06:31] the Dove and saw what the Dove was
[1:06:32] looking for a place to rest where we're
[1:06:34] now think about it all the times
[1:06:36] throughout the Old Testament that the
[1:06:38] Dove visited amen all the times that
[1:06:42] people say I saw God face-to-face what
[1:06:45] was me how many times did angels visit
[1:06:48] in the Old Testament
[1:06:49] amen but they never stayed they never
[1:06:52] remained they cut they would come and
[1:06:54] then they would go the angel will come
[1:06:55] and speak to Zacharias you know the
[1:06:57] angel came and spoke to Hanna the angel
[1:06:59] will come and speak to you know David
[1:07:02] her to Abraham but they always come and
[1:07:03] there go they come and they go
[1:07:05] a man by now on Jesus Christ this Holy
[1:07:07] Spirit comes down like a dove and he
[1:07:09] stays and he remains and so the angel
[1:07:12] told John the Baptist where the one
[1:07:15] where you see the Holy Spirit coming
[1:07:16] down and remaining upon that is the Son
[1:07:19] of God amen now what now what was that
[1:07:21] the Holy Spirit was brooding over the
[1:07:23] earth and it found again another
[1:07:25] creation that it could rest on Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ the Son of the Living God amen
[1:07:31] now in the thirty-three years later the
[1:07:34] Holy Spirit still brooding on the earth
[1:07:36] looking for a place to rest or to do it
[1:07:39] came down like tongues of fire upon
[1:07:41] their heads the Holy Spirit found a
[1:07:43] place and what did he do it now all
[1:07:44] sudden they couldn't see the tongues of
[1:07:46] fire any more where to go it went into
[1:07:49] their hearts why because the Holy Spirit
[1:07:51] came down he is brooding brooding birdy
[1:07:53] and all of a sudden he found place to
[1:07:54] land in the Upper Room any state and he
[1:07:57] is recreating the Garden of Eden out of
[1:07:59] those men Amen we still doing the same
[1:08:02] the Holy Spirit is still brooding
[1:08:04] looking for a place to rest still
[1:08:07] looking for a place where he can land
[1:08:08] amen and have his rest amen
[1:08:16] amen amen amen
[1:08:26] you know brother Brandon said that there
[1:08:29] was a three full purpose of the mystery
[1:08:31] of God being revealed in this hour you
[1:08:34] know you know he said that the
[1:08:36] three-fold purpose of God's entire
[1:08:38] creation was revealed in this hour and
[1:08:42] he said it was what God was to be
[1:08:44] manifested fully in Christ in one body
[1:08:47] so we could see him we could handle him
[1:08:51] we could know what he thinks like we
[1:08:53] could know how he acts we know why God
[1:08:56] when God we know we know what God's
[1:08:58] thoughts are towards the sick because
[1:09:01] when God was manifest in the flesh he
[1:09:03] healed to say Amen
[1:09:05] we know what God's thoughts were towards
[1:09:07] the sinners because when he was down
[1:09:09] here in the flesh he forgave the sinners
[1:09:11] amen we know a God's thoughts were
[1:09:14] towards those that were in prison
[1:09:15] because he set the captives free amen we
[1:09:19] know that God was completely revealed in
[1:09:21] Jesus Christ amen and we know that God
[1:09:24] has thoughts of fellowship why because
[1:09:26] he drew 12 men to himself to fellowship
[1:09:28] with them amen amen going to do he kept
[1:09:31] he loved Mary he loved Martha he loved
[1:09:33] he loved the 12 disciples he he loved a
[1:09:36] Lazarus we know that he loves fellowship
[1:09:39] I mean and we know that he is the same
[1:09:41] he has been revealed that revelation has
[1:09:45] been set free it can never go and it can
[1:09:47] never be changed was it I then what was
[1:09:50] the second for that
[1:09:51] was Christ was now after being
[1:09:54] completely revealed in Jesus Christ now
[1:09:57] God was gonna do the same thing in us
[1:09:59] and reveal himself inside of us it's
[1:10:03] still going on amen while the world is

[1:11:02] worse there's no reason to get angry
[1:11:04] about it there's no angry to fuss about
[1:11:06] it Amen Jesus didn't fuss about the
[1:11:08] Romans Amen week there's no reason for
[1:11:10] us to fuss about the Americans amen it's
[1:11:14] it this prophesied the Lamb the country
[1:11:17] that rose up like a lamb is gonna speak
[1:11:18] like a dragon it just it is what it is

[1:11:25] tree of life bears fruits and the fruits
[1:11:27] of life inside of you is love joy peace
[1:11:32] long-suffering gentleness meekness amen
[1:11:38] temperance against these things there is
[1:11:40] no law why because when you have the
[1:11:44] Tree of Life that was in the Garden of
[1:11:46] Eden I mean it was the Holy Spirit
[1:11:48] brooded over the waters created land to
[1:11:53] come out of the waters a mint created a
[1:11:56] garden called Eden off over here and
[1:11:58] then the Holy Spirit came down and
[1:12:01] planted itself and called itself the
[1:12:03] Tree of Life why he found a place where
[1:12:06] he could have rest amen The Tree of Life
[1:12:09] found a place where it could rest and
[1:12:12] took up roots and had more fruits a man
[1:12:15] now that same spirit is still here amen
[1:12:18] now the The Tree of Life had thus
[1:12:20] flaming swords they were protecting the
[1:12:22] way no one could get back to the Tree of
[1:12:24] Life
[1:12:24] throughout all the Old Testament even
[1:12:26] though the Tree of Life kept busy in
[1:12:27] them kept busy in them they couldn't get
[1:12:29] they couldn't grab a hold of it they
[1:12:31] couldn't grasp it they couldn't keep it
[1:12:32] Amen but all they could do is I believe
[1:12:34] unto it Amen but now the Tree of Life
[1:12:37] reappeared again as Jesus Christ and
[1:12:39] walked amongst men amen and now the Tree
[1:12:43] of Life is
[1:12:43] has taken roots inside of a bride has
[1:12:46] bearing the fruits of the Spirit in our
[1:12:48] lives

[1:12:54] eternal life even why it took uproot and
[1:12:58] it found good ground amen
[1:13:00] inside your heart amen and that's what
[1:13:03] he is doing he's drawing a bride now to
[1:13:05] his old self amen so why is he doing
[1:13:09] that that's the second full of his
[1:13:10] purpose well the first of all was that
[1:13:12] God could be completely revealed in the
[1:13:15] body of the Lord Jesus Christ and he did
[1:13:17] it now he is pouring the complete
[1:13:20] revelation of Jesus Christ into his
[1:13:22] bride so that God can now be expressed
[1:13:27] in his bride if she'll just let him amen
[1:13:30] if she'll just let him amen and then
[1:13:32] what is it what is the purpose after
[1:13:35] that was that God can restore back the
[1:13:39] Garden of Eden on earth to get Christ
[1:13:41] and his bride living in a garden yes
[1:13:45] Amen you know I think about how many you
[1:13:48] know how many times I like to travel I
[1:13:50] love to be out in nature I like to get
[1:13:53] away from all the things they're
[1:13:54] man-made and get out to the things that
[1:13:57] God made amen so I can see the things
[1:14:00] that God that has God's DNA spoken word
[1:14:03] DNA on the inside it's not concrete or
[1:14:06] or all his glass and all these different
[1:14:08] things but as something like a forest or
[1:14:10] or an ocean or something that's living
[1:14:13] and a lie that God created speaking out
[1:14:16] of his own mouth
[1:14:17] amen he get me out there and I can have
[1:14:20] a good time

[1:14:25] living in that type of atmosphere yeah I
[1:14:27] mean it won't be long
[1:14:29] amen so they're they they are feasting
[1:14:32] on the things of man I am feasting on
[1:14:35] the things of God amen and I had but
[1:14:37] they're they are ignorant of the promise
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:41] there's just like we read now Tenaya
[1:14:43] there he is he was ignorant that the
[1:14:47] promise was to Solomon not to a Danite
[1:14:50] but when it was revealed a sudden fear
[1:14:52] came over so we'll be in this day when
[1:14:54] when all of a sudden it's been
[1:14:55] prophesied already all
[1:14:57] seems to come to pass but some of these
[1:14:59] days Jesus said I will not eat of the
[1:15:01] fruit of the vine again until he eat
[1:15:03] with you again that promise is waiting
[1:15:05] for me
[1:15:06] amen jesus said it has set a date for us
[1:15:11] it's like when you get when you when you
[1:15:13] really like to be with someone you
[1:15:14] really enjoy spending time with them and
[1:15:16] you set up a date let's go out and
[1:15:17] fellowship or some food or a coffee or
[1:15:21] something like that and fellowship to go
[1:15:23] into another amen so Christ has set the
[1:15:27] same date with us
[1:15:28] I want to fellowship with you I will not
[1:15:30] drink of the fruit of the vine again
[1:15:33] until I eat it with you up and glory
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] it's a promise and while we are waiting
[1:15:38] for this promise their fruit feasting on
[1:15:40] the things of the world we are feasting
[1:15:42] on the Word of God amen amen
[1:15:45] one of these days it won't be long you
[1:15:47] know the according to the prophecies of
[1:15:49] the Bible that when Israel will become a
[1:15:52] nation again and the mercy will switch
[1:15:54] from the Gentiles to the Jews Israel has
[1:15:57] now been a nation for 70 years it's past
[1:16:00] due it's past time but it's right in
[1:16:03] God's time amen it's right here it won't
[1:16:07] be long amen amen
[1:16:10] my brother showed me that thing about
[1:16:12] that Hebrew worship service you know the
[1:16:16] Jews they're worshiping there in
[1:16:17] Jerusalem they were worshiping how could
[1:16:22] they do that they know Jehovah think
[1:16:27] about it
[1:16:28] if you if you if you saw a pile that was
[1:16:32] dry you and you saw someone with a match
[1:16:36] going towards it you'd say that's gonna
[1:16:38] go up in flames if you see the Jews
[1:16:41] rejoicing waiting for the fire of the
[1:16:45] Holy Ghost to come upon them they are
[1:16:48] waiting for their rejoicing it won't be
[1:16:50] long
[1:16:51] soon this ooze that spark of the Holy
[1:16:53] Ghost hits them Israel will be changed
[1:16:57] it's a it's like a it's like a forest
[1:17:00] waiting to be caught on fire
[1:17:03] amen they need a savior they need a
[1:17:06] deliverer a man Israel's in the bad spot
[1:17:08] they're surrounded you know the day that
[1:17:10] Israel the day that Israel declared
[1:17:13] their independence in 1948 they were
[1:17:15] attacked by 19 nations the day that they
[1:17:21] declared that they were going to be the
[1:17:23] new state called Israel and they made
[1:17:27] the declaration there at the United
[1:17:30] Nations they were attacked by I think
[1:17:34] it's like 19 their separate nations and
[1:17:36] they want and they want it now how could
[1:17:40] that be how could that happen
[1:17:42] how could they win amen like the three
[1:17:46] day war they're a six-day war in 1967
[1:17:48] when they were attacked by surprise and
[1:17:51] they won the batter being attacked on
[1:17:54] one of their holy days and they weren't
[1:17:55] expecting it they fought back and won
[1:17:58] more ground there's worse for their
[1:18:01] enemies there was for them how did they
[1:18:04] do that I think they lost 50 min or
[1:18:07] something like that or if if that while
[1:18:09] other people lost thousands how did that
[1:18:12] happen because there's someone behind
[1:18:14] them there is a power greater than human
[1:18:17] beings behind them well and what is he
[1:18:20] doing he's protecting them and
[1:18:21] preserving now for seven years he's
[1:18:24] protected and preserved them so that
[1:18:26] they could be ready to receive the Holy
[1:18:27] Ghost when they receive the Holy Ghost
[1:18:29] we go up amen and what happens when we
[1:18:33] go up they will be feasting on the
[1:18:36] things of the world we will be feasting
[1:18:39] on things of God and glory amen and then
[1:18:42] a sudden fear will come upon them when
[1:18:44] Jesus Christ returns he fights again
[1:18:46] against them with the sword of his mouth
[1:18:49] which is the word amen who is king over
[1:18:52] your life amen Vashti found out that the
[1:18:56] feast that she was feasting at in her
[1:19:00] upper chamber did not even prepare her
[1:19:04] to be one with the King whatever was
[1:19:08] going on in that in that upper chamber
[1:19:10] didn't prepare her to be one with her
[1:19:13] King Amy
[1:19:14] by a stir the feast that she went to for
[1:19:21] six months of this and so your feast
[1:19:23] prepared her to meet with her King amen
[1:19:27] hey man what are you preparing for the
[1:19:31] king is coming
[1:19:32] amen the true king is coming there's
[1:19:34] been many there's been many of they're
[1:19:36] called kings there's been many of
[1:19:38] they're called saviors but the true
[1:19:40] Savior will come amen
[1:19:42] and our who is king over your life a man
[1:19:45] as I was thinking about this scripture
[1:19:46] the the the this is what that the what
[1:19:51] hat this is what happens when you do not
[1:19:56] make a plain and clear who is to be king
[1:19:59] over your life
[1:20:00] if King David had made it clear who was
[1:20:04] to be king after him at a denying ever
[1:20:08] would have had a chance to rise up and
[1:20:09] declare himself king they meant but
[1:20:12] because it wasn't made click clear who
[1:20:15] was King Adonai had a chance and it's
[1:20:18] the same thing in our own lives if we do
[1:20:20] not make it clear who is king over our
[1:20:22] life in every single area every single
[1:20:25] attribute if we do not surrender every
[1:20:27] single part of our lives to Christ the
[1:20:29] King then there are other little things
[1:20:31] will rise up will rise up will rise up
[1:20:34] and I've seen it in my own life amen
[1:20:36] just forget that one area and all of a
[1:20:39] sudden do you think I don't have to
[1:20:41] glorify Him as God in this area of my
[1:20:43] life or I don't have to glorify him his
