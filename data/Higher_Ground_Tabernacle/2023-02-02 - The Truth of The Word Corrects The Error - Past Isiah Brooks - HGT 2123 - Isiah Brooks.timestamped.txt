[1:30] what I'm saying how are you going to get
[1:32] out of the Grave if you don't believe
[1:35] God is able to bring you out
[1:38] no matter how many years the Bible said
[1:42] those Old Testament Saints died in faith
[1:46] they knew they were going to get up they
[1:49] knew there was going to be a
[1:50] resurrection how did they know by
[1:52] Revelation Joseph said don't leave my
[1:55] bones here Amen in Egypt take me there
[1:58] in the promised land because that's
[2:00] where the word is going that's where the
[2:03] resurrection is coming for you
[2:05] understand me as long as you in the
[2:07] promised land which is the word of this
[2:09] hour
[2:10] you will have and see a resurrection
[2:14] Hallelujah
[2:16] glory to God
[2:19] he said it's written stay right with the
[2:22] word right see we understand and I'm
[2:25] trying to hurry God and Sunday Times
[2:28] the Bible said many times
[2:30] in many ways spoke to the spoke the word
[2:33] through the prophets
[2:34] this is why Brethren was trying to get
[2:36] people to see who was really on the
[2:38] scene
[2:39] if you follow the message you'll
[2:41] understand what he was doing he was
[2:43] literally trying to get the people to
[2:45] see this is Elohim
[2:47] this is this is where the Bible said
[2:49] that he spoke to us through and by his
[2:52] son this is the age all the other age he
[2:55] preached and spoke by Prophet but here
[2:57] the prophet of all prophets which was
[3:00] Jesus Christ himself spoke to us see
[3:03] this message is not William Brando's
[3:05] message it's literally Jesus Christ's
[3:08] message
[3:08] and in William Brandon's message is the
[3:11] message of Jesus Christ and you
[3:13] understand what I'm saying it's
[3:15] literally The Living Word of God coming
[3:17] to a filthy generation as we are
[3:20] a place where you think it would be
[3:22] hopeless Amen to resurrect or to call a
[3:26] bride out of the most wicked age ever
[3:29] but that's the way God loves to do it he
[3:32] loved hopeless situations he's the one
[3:35] that could pull bring uh bring light out
[3:38] of Darkness
[3:42] yes
[3:44] if you can see what the man God have
[3:47] mercy
[3:49] that's what Paul was trying to say too
[3:51] Paul says listen I want to know him in
[3:54] the power of his resurrection now I want
[3:56] to know him in his suffering and in the
[3:58] power of his resurrection Paul says
[4:00] listen
[4:01] Jesus I didn't die for you he said I
[4:03] didn't die for you it was Jesus Christ
[4:04] who died for you see what I'm trying to
[4:07] say the gospel even the way I'm
[4:08] preaching must increase
[4:11] you understand me because it's got to be
[4:13] more than lecturing it's got to be more
[4:16] than me preaching it's got to be power
[4:18] and demonstration and what you must need
[4:21] to know brother Brooks we're pressing
[4:24] we're moving forward we believe in the
[4:27] word I can't make it happen but I'm
[4:30] believing by God's grace those things
[4:32] will happen
[4:34] it has to happen as long as I stay with
[4:37] the word
[4:38] God will vindicate his word not me he'll
[4:42] vindicate his word
[4:47] Hallelujah
[4:49] this is yet the characteristics of God
[4:51] today he not and listen this is why what
[4:54] what good is it going to do to you if
[4:55] I'm preaching faith and you don't
[4:57] believe what I'm preaching nothing can
[4:59] be done Jesus couldn't even do it he
[5:02] went into Capernaum and he couldn't do
[5:04] no Miracles because they had no faith if
[5:07] you don't have faith in what I'm
[5:08] preaching then nothing going to happen
[5:10] but for those who can have faith in this
[5:13] word that I'm preaching if I'm doing
[5:14] something wrong if I'm preaching wrong
[5:16] you're obligated to show me
[5:18] you understand me but if I'm preaching
[5:21] right take it believe it and you'll see
[5:23] God work a miracle in your life you'll
[5:26] begin to see changes in your life why do
[5:28] you say that brother verse because I'm
[5:30] seeing changes in my life
[5:33] Hallelujah
[5:35] see this is yet the characteristics of
[5:37] God today he not only speaks through a
[5:40] prophet but but the world but he wrote
[5:44] the word under inspiration come with the
[5:46] prophet today
[5:48] because of Technology it is a recorded
[5:52] in books and takes
[5:54] y'all understand me they had
[5:58] sheepskin and from sheepskin it was put
[6:01] onto paper and now it's put onto
[6:04] magnetic tapes
[6:06] but God is wonderful because he does it
[6:09] in such a simple way
[6:11] and he does it in a way to confuse and
[6:14] blind the unbeliever
[6:18] Hallelujah
[6:20] but like I said the other day so that we
[6:22] can understand those before us had
[6:26] brother Branham they had a prophet they
[6:29] could I mean a physical man they could
[6:31] eat with him they could hunt with him
[6:32] they could they could sit down and you
[6:35] know laugh with him
[6:36] but we don't have that
[6:39] but the greatest thing that we do have
[6:41] is The Voice
[6:44] because it is the voice of God y'all
[6:47] understand what I'm saying it the glory
[6:50] of the prophets was greater but the
[6:52] glory of Jesus Christ is greater
[6:55] amen
[6:57] I'm gonna say that again because I could
[6:59] feel it almost like on the line somebody
[7:01] out there let me tell you something
[7:04] what brother Branham did was great what
[7:07] God did through him was great
[7:10] but he saved the best for last
[7:14] night and that's the Bride of Jesus
[7:16] Christ
[7:18] listen to those tapes after 63 you'll
[7:21] hear him say things to the Bride of
[7:23] Jesus Christ he never said to laodicea
[7:27] trying to get her to see her position
[7:29] and our position must come back to the
[7:33] original position that Ephesus had
[7:37] amen is that right in the preview of the
[7:39] Bride the first church came by was
[7:42] Ephesus
[7:44] she came through walking to the tune of
[7:46] the word and when the prophet thought
[7:48] that all was lost
[7:50] Miss America in her
[7:53] rock and roll rocking rock himself
[7:57] okay
[8:00] here she comes
[8:02] marching to the tune of Onward Christian
[8:05] Soldier marching to the word to the beat
[8:07] of the word he said she was just like
[8:10] the the first bride that came around
[8:13] she's the only one that gets a second
[8:16] preview
[8:19] all the other churches had one chance
[8:22] the Bride Comes Along why because Jesus
[8:24] Christ is Alpha and he's Omega
[8:29] Hallelujah
[8:31] see the identification of a man see he's
[8:34] speaking through a man that was called
[8:35] to be a prophet now the Bible says that
[8:38] God is hundred times diverse man has
[8:40] spoke to the fathers through the prophet
[8:42] we also read over in second Peter that
[8:45] the whole word of God was wrote by them
[8:47] man of all moved by the Holy Ghost wrote
[8:51] the Bible they were prophets the word
[8:54] come to them and they wrote it wrote it
[8:56] down under inspiration first they were
[8:59] identified prophets then they wrote the
[9:01] word of inspiration and they had the
[9:04] interpretation of divine revelation
[9:06] because it was God in the man
[9:09] don't you know God know his word
[9:12] now that's the way he shows himself in
[9:14] his characteristics of identification
[9:16] their Visions being Vindicated in God
[9:20] characteristics in them making himself
[9:22] known to the people that's what he was
[9:25] doing in brother Byron of making himself
[9:27] known through the in the people through
[9:30] the people
[9:31] you love the Lord
[9:33] God cannot change his characteristics
[9:37] people say well why Prophet because he
[9:40] that's the way he decided to come
[9:43] he was more than just a prophet
[9:46] and he was trying to tell everybody that
[9:48] the inspiration that was behind him was
[9:50] was was Elohim
[9:53] now you don't have to believe that but
[9:55] that's what he said he said because
[9:57] Elohim came to Abraham
[10:00] he said if you go down in Genesis it
[10:02] says where God created he said that's
[10:04] Elohim
[10:05] right and so he's telling us amen God
[10:07] Has Come how many of y'all remember
[10:09] brother random said that Jesus Christ
[10:10] created his own bride
[10:12] that's that's a quote Jesus Christ
[10:15] created his own brother so let me ask
[10:17] you
[10:18] when and where did he do it
[10:25] huh
[10:26] oh no yeah yeah that's true too it was
[10:29] before but I'm talking about now
[10:33] never in the history of the church
[10:36] outside of Ephesus where God unveils
[10:39] himself by the way of his divine nature
[10:43] Amendment right that's right now he's
[10:46] creating his bride
[10:48] right now
[10:50] here on Earth
[10:52] like he did out his bride
[10:55] but he could only listen this is what
[10:57] you're going to understand he's creating
[10:59] a spiritual man
[11:02] a man either not only his image but his
[11:05] likeness
[11:06] right
[11:10] and and you know the thing about it is
[11:12] we we fail to see the importance of
[11:15] adding to your virtue knowledge and
[11:18] Temperance Faith you know adding we we
[11:20] fail to see what he's doing he's
[11:22] building
[11:24] he's making a bride
[11:27] and it is an invisible Union it's it's
[11:30] God bringing it up to Divine love
[11:32] because in order to be equally yoked you
[11:35] must have Divine love because he is
[11:37] divine love
[11:40] this is why the scripture says those
[11:42] that have gone on they cannot be
[11:44] completed without us we are the Capstone
[11:47] Ministry
[11:50] we are God's Finishing Touch
[11:53] this is why he put us in such opposition
[11:56] because he's expecting perfection
[12:00] and he knows that the only way that you
[12:02] can produce Perfection is that
[12:04] Perfection is living in you
[12:05] you must be born again
[12:10] now his characteristics never change God
[12:13] cannot change his character can and no
[12:16] more than a lamb can change his
[12:18] character or any other thing can change
[12:20] his his character because as long as it
[12:23] is it is original it's original and if
[12:26] you change anything then you change it
[12:28] from its original
[12:30] that's why the spoken word is the
[12:32] Original Seed it has to come by way of
[12:35] preaching and people won't come the
[12:37] Bible says the day that you see uh the
[12:40] Lord approaching you ought to come
[12:42] together the more why God creating
[12:46] he's judging this is the house of God
[12:49] he's he's bringing forth little of my SP
[12:53] I've been there I've seen you know in in
[12:57] meetings I'm preaching I'm preaching
[12:58] under the inspiration of the word and
[13:01] God filled people in with the Holy Ghost
[13:03] I didn't have to touch them I didn't
[13:05] have to lay hands on them but because
[13:06] they believed the word that God filled
[13:09] them with the Holy Ghost and they never
[13:11] backslid you understand me
[13:14] praise God it didn't come by me the
[13:16] birth came by the word is that the right
[13:19] way absolutely Peter preached on the day
[13:21] of Pentecost and the power of God came
[13:24] down
[13:26] Hallelujah when they preached in
[13:28] cornelia's house the power of God came
[13:31] down gave them the Holy Ghost right
[13:34] there because they believed what they
[13:36] heard and they received what they heard
[13:37] and God came down and Vindicated it
[13:40] that's the original way
[13:48] I cannot change he Remains the Same we
[13:52] know that the Bible said Jesus Christ is
[13:54] the same yesterday today and forever you
[13:56] listen to brother Brown oh my God if you
[13:58] listen to the voice of God coming
[14:00] through that man at the end of his
[14:02] ministry he was trying to tell the
[14:04] people I don't need to lay hands if I
[14:06] could get you to believe what I'm
[14:07] preaching it'll happen to you right now
[14:09] everything you're healing you if you
[14:11] you can walk if you're blind you
[14:13] can see he was just telling them it's
[14:15] him here God if you can see God move me
[14:19] out of the way see God he's here if you
[14:22] can believe that God is here he's
[14:24] basically saying you can have whatever
[14:26] you ask for I heard the prophet say
[14:29] something the other day
[14:30] he said God will continue to help you
[14:33] believe that's the essence of what he
[14:35] said he had tried this and if you don't
[14:37] believe he'll try something else to make
[14:39] you believe and you know that's the
[14:40] truth right
[14:41] because even in the even in the prayer
[14:43] line he's literally talking to these
[14:45] people and brother Ben said oh you be
[14:48] careful you're going to miss it you're
[14:49] going to miss it he said let me do
[14:50] something to help you sister so and so
[14:52] who was that
[14:54] that was God
[14:56] helping the people to believe
[14:59] God help us Jesus
[15:02] see that's how I'm building my
[15:05] Foundation
[15:06] is is built on this message this word I
[15:10] mean you know I have nothing else to
[15:12] hold on to and really I'm not holding to
[15:15] it he's holding to me you know I was
[15:17] telling the Lord I says Lord I don't
[15:18] even see I really don't see what he you
[15:21] know why because you know I can see
[15:25] where I've been so faulty throughout my
[15:27] life and you know in times you thought I
[15:29] could see I thought I was a Christian in
[15:31] reality I was not
[15:33] if you be honest with you didn't live
[15:35] white one
[15:36] you didn't pray like one you didn't read
[15:39] and study your Bible like one
[15:41] so you had a false what
[15:44] that's right false belief false
[15:46] testimony false communion
[15:50] but God is merciful
[15:56] oh Jesus now
[15:59] his characteristics never fails
[16:02] is always is the same
[16:05] is that right it never fails I'm almost
[16:09] done
[16:11] but listen First Corinthians 14 through
[16:14] 6 through 9.
[16:17] and it says
[16:20] now brethren
[16:22] if I come unto you speaking with tongues
[16:25] what shall I profit you
[16:28] accept I shall speak to you either by
[16:30] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[16:33] prophesying or by Doctrine let me say it
[16:37] like this when the truth is revealed to
[16:39] any of you
[16:41] and you reject it you die
[16:45] right there
[16:46] you don't even know it
[16:48] because when the Pentecostals rejected
[16:50] by the Venom they died
[16:53] they didn't understand it wasn't a man
[16:55] they were rejecting
[16:57] right let the Lord told Samuel the
[17:00] people now are not rejecting you
[17:02] they're rejecting me
[17:04] and they rejected the Lord and they put
[17:06] him out the church and look at them now
[17:09] oh my God and you tell me that he wasn't
[17:13] a prophet
[17:14] and he told us everything and how bad it
[17:16] was going to get
[17:18] my Lord have mercy if I come unto you
[17:21] speak with tongues and what shall I
[17:23] profit you except I shall speak to you
[17:26] either by Revelation or by knowledge or
[17:29] by prophesying or by Doctrine in even
[17:33] then without life-giving sound whether
[17:36] pipe or harp except they give a
[17:38] distinction in the sound how shall it be
[17:41] known what is piped or harped
[17:45] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[17:47] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[17:50] battle why did Paul use the word
[17:56] trumpet and battle
[17:58] because it refers to us
[18:01] trumpet
[18:03] whenever a trumpet is sounded it denotes
[18:06] War
[18:07] is that right and brother Branham said
[18:10] the seals to the to the Bride of Jesus
[18:13] Christ is the trumpets to the Jews
[18:16] right and you know that when brother
[18:19] random was on the scene he blew a
[18:21] trumpet
[18:23] he calls Havoc
[18:26] in the church world
[18:28] they literally hated him and some people
[18:31] rejoice when he died because they did
[18:35] not see
[18:37] that they have been rejected by God and
[18:42] they sit in darkness now to this day
[18:46] that generation not only and curse
[18:48] themselves
[18:50] but they cursed their children
[18:52] like akan did
[18:56] for if the trumpet gives an uncertain
[18:58] child this is what I'm saying the word
[19:00] doesn't give an uncertain sound the
[19:03] message doesn't give an uncertain sound
[19:05] now we can misinterpret it when it
[19:08] really needs no interpretation it's it's
[19:11] playing it's clear
[19:14] but oftentimes we put our little
[19:16] something in there but that's when you
[19:18] become error it becomes error and God
[19:21] corrects the error
[19:24] Hallelujah is that right
[19:27] listen brother Adam preached a lot of
[19:29] things and guess what happened people
[19:31] would misconstrue they'd change it and
[19:34] make him say things they didn't even say
[19:38] but he said truth
[19:40] but God you know we can't help it when
[19:42] people twisted
[19:44] right so likewise you accept ye utter by
[19:48] tongue words easy to be understood how
[19:51] shall it be known what is spoken for we
[19:53] shall speak into the air
[19:56] thank God for interpreting us
[20:00] right I don't speak French but when
[20:03] French is spoken
[20:04] I hardly understand anything
[20:07] but when there's an interpreter
[20:10] I can understand French
[20:12] if that makes sense but see God says
[20:15] listen I'm going to be playing straight
[20:19] I'm gonna tell you exactly how it is
[20:22] and it's up to you the whole truth
[20:25] the wisdom of this whole message is to
[20:29] keep God's word fear God and keep his
[20:32] Commandments that's wisdom now I'm
[20:35] almost done Psalms 119 1 3 1 103 to 106.
[20:39] how sweet
[20:41] are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter
[20:45] than honey to my mouth
[20:50] through thy precepts I get understanding
[20:54] therefore I hate
[20:56] every false way do y'all understand why
[21:00] he's saying that because every false way
[21:02] leads me into destruction
[21:06] amen
[21:08] even to the point when people tried to
[21:11] make brother Branham God he says Oh my
[21:13] he went off the field because of it and
[21:16] he said you make me an antichrist and we
[21:19] still have people in this message that
[21:21] truly makes brother Barnum an antichrist
[21:26] sad
[21:28] do you really think they're going to
[21:29] heaven with that
[21:31] it ain't happening that's a new gospel
[21:33] that's a different gospel
[21:36] Paul said it's another Jesus
[21:41] I'll get on trouble that's okay
[21:44] that word is a lamp unto my feet
[21:47] and a light into my pathway
[21:49] I have Swan listen Thy word what
[21:53] direction are you going in my point is
[21:55] what are you becoming
[21:58] what's happening where is the changes in
[22:00] you there must be changes being made in
[22:04] you
[22:05] growing up into Christ
[22:09] maturing into Christ not allowing
[22:12] yourself to fall into arguments and
[22:15] strife and bitterness and all these
[22:17] natural things that the flesh bring upon
[22:20] us we must break beyond that
[22:23] so much so that we'll love even our
[22:25] enemies
[22:26] Hallelujah we haven't even gotten to the
[22:28] place where we love each other we need
[22:30] to love our each other and then love our
[22:32] enemies as well
[22:34] I have sworn and I will perform it that
[22:37] I will keep the righteous judgment thy
[22:40] righteous judgment Hallelujah one more
[22:43] and I'm Gonna Let You Go proverbs 4 3
[22:45] and 7 and I hope you're getting what I'm
[22:47] saying I can't preach what I really see
[22:50] in one night or one service but I'll
[22:53] tell you this people
[22:56] when you take your eyes off of Jesus
[22:59] you're going to do just like Peter
[23:01] you're going to sink
[23:04] you got to keep your eyes the Bible says
[23:07] when when brother Adam said he saw the
[23:08] preview of the church
[23:10] he said he saw them
[23:12] marching to the
[23:13] tune of onward trees I love that song
[23:15] because it says Onward Christian Soldier
[23:18] marching as to war with the cross of
[23:22] Jesus going on before that was what was
[23:26] leading the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[23:28] was what was in the in the Forefront of
[23:31] her it was absolutely Calvary she kept
[23:34] her kept her eyes on what Calvary did
[23:37] for her that's what kept her in line
[23:46] for I was my Father's son
[23:49] tender and only beloved in the sight of
[23:53] my mother
[23:54] he taught me also and said unto me let
[23:58] thine heart retain my words
[24:01] keep my Commandments and live
[24:05] get wisdom get understanding
[24:09] forget it not neither decline from the
[24:12] words of my mouth
[24:15] um
[24:18] God's mouth
[24:21] or God's mouthpiece
[24:24] was William Branham
[24:28] and he literally laid out and dressed
[24:32] the bride by the word otherwise he'd
[24:34] still be here
[24:36] but he laid in record everything she
[24:39] needed to know and he know by God's
[24:42] grace she will find it
[24:46] and she will know what to do with the
[24:48] word
[24:50] right she knows she's different she's a
[24:54] speckle bird
[24:56] covered by the blood of Jesus she knows
[24:59] what to do with it and she knows this is
[25:02] her preparation
[25:05] to meet the Lord
[25:07] I'm not prepared to do nothing else I
[25:10] don't care to be a president or Governor
[25:12] I'm preparing to meet the Lord
[25:15] Hallelujah
[25:17] oh Jesus that's truth
[25:20] forsake or not
[25:22] she shall preserve thee love her and she
[25:25] shall keep thee wisdom is the principal
[25:28] thing therefore get wisdom and with all
[25:32] that getting get understanding
[25:36] in closing I'm just going to say it like
[25:38] that God is God
[25:42] and we are so privileged it's not half
[25:44] of my message but we are so so
[25:47] privileged to know that the Living God
[25:52] is living now and he's building us
[25:56] inwardly
[25:58] inwardly he's building us into the
[26:01] perfect statue of Christ will Crown us
[26:04] with his divine nature Divine love
[26:08] and when those things take place which
[26:12] they are taking place and only God knows
[26:15] when everything is finished then we'll
[26:17] make a translation
[26:19] but God is waiting on us I mean the dead
[26:22] in Christ can't even get up yet until
[26:25] God is complete as his masterpiece
[26:28] amen so he finishes the touch with the
[26:32] squeeze
[26:36] your final tests
[26:38] is the oncoming squeeze
[26:43] your character
[26:45] must be his
[26:47] when he was under the squeeze the Bible
[26:49] said he rail not
[26:52] he didn't speak in vain
[26:55] the Bible said he opened not his mouth
[26:59] he didn't even you know defend himself
[27:02] he just stood like a lamb
[27:05] being sheared
[27:08] and at the end of his journey
[27:11] he said father forgive them
[27:14] for they know not what they do
[27:16] no bitterness
[27:18] no hatred
[27:20] no Envy no strife
[27:23] he
[27:24] projected his character
[27:26] as the Lamb of God

[27:34] father God we so thank you Lord help us
