he's everything oh I love him adore him I lay my life before him he's everything to me I love him will yes I love him odd for him I live my life before him either everything to me [Music] e-everything oh I want y'all to know tonight that no matter how tough the devil try to be he's actually afraid of you that's why he worked so hard to keep you from knowing who you are and the authority in which you had a half he is a liar and we know him according to the Word of God as a defeated foe and there's nothing he can do about it he is ordained to be defeated and we are ordained to be winners so we thank God for the victory in which he has given me over these past few days I could have been in glory but God said no I could have been afflicted in such a way that I would not have been able to perhaps preach the gospel anymore but God said no I think I for my wife under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost plus desperation and she called and by the 9-1-1 and because of it I stand today the Lord works in mysterious ways we met a doctor today who we connected with the doctor who actually injected my eye which was a standard procedure the man was very humble he explained to us this is what he normally does but I happen to be one of those people that Satan got in there and tried to really mess things up nevertheless we serve a God and he saw everything and I believe that everything that we do we must be mindful of God acknowledge God in all our ways and he shall direct our paths so we thank God for the grace of God what is awesome about the situation demand the doctor being a Christian told us that he would take care of whatever bill we will would incur or whatever is left over he would take care of him so we thank God he showed us where you really didn't have to do it but he did it and he said let this be my tithe into the church so we think are for his amazing grace God and I honestly I am supposed to go back within four weeks five but nevertheless when I when he see me it's gonna be complete nothing else will have necessary to be done have to be done I I believe that all God joined us together for a purpose and I believe the purpose is for this message I so love the Lord I just want to please him I just have this thing about me I just want to please him and I thank God for the saints of God all the prayers that have gone up for me some people have had it had it so bad out there that I'm near death or dying they had done already called a family of course that was not the way it was and I thank God for it seemed like there was something else I wanted to say but let's go on with the word as we stand we're going to come from Acts the first chapter axé the first chapter the eighth verse and then we're going to come from Ephesians three my subject tonight is the authority of the church the authority of the church you know brother Branham says don't let the devil make you feel like you've lost your experience and that really blessed my soul because we do go through trials and that's one of the things that Satan will accuse you of or tell you see you don't lost your experience you you really you know your you ain't saying but let me tell you that is alive from the devil when a man follows romans 8 9 and 10 confessed with his mouth and believe in his heart receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior the Bible said at that point he passed from death unto life and we get believing or not no matter what your behavior is from that point on if you sincerely comes to Christ he promise you'll never lose lose you you'll come up you'll be out in the outer court you'll be a you won't be in the city but you'll be there but most of us we want to not just be there see right if we we are we want to be in the city in the city call to live in the city that's a good message in let me go on yeah yeah listen brother brother Keith told me this and listen to it why are people so tossed about you ought to go listen to it and thoroughly listen it's really really good I've been blessed by it acts 1 and 8 but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is calm upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth Ephesians 3 beginning at the fourteenth verse for this cause I bow my knee unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and death and height and to know the love of Christ with pass it's knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us now I must say that again because once life is sprung up in you that's God and that God is able to sin do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think and it's a Satan's business it is his job to make us think that God will not do it for us or you in particular it's all right he can do it for others but not me I'm just too sinful I'm too unworthy I'm too well God saw that that's why we have a savior hallelujah now into him that is able to exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh continue to work in us unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages that mean our age is included world without end amen you may be seated I'm sorry let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you with thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray that you will impart this word unto us give us what we stand in need of in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and when I when I think about how the church let's say church history I'm not talking about denominations I'm talking about the church individuals those who have been born of God those who came through hard times and trials and tests as I was speaking with brother Troy this has been a season of tests strong tests but all of these tests are for us God doesn't send these tests to give us put us in the atmosphere of unbelief but he's pushing and driving and and and doing all he can that we may gain faith muscles muscles to to believe that we can go into the Holies of Holies because so many of us don't believe that we can get there but I heard brother Branham said we have a right it is our right healing is our right salvation is our right right so going into the Holies of Holies is our right it is there for us the curtain was rent the veil was rent in twain right and all we need to do is walk in there why because according to hebrews jesus christ has already gone into the veil is that all right and so therefore if he has opened that way to us it is our responsibility to go into Holies of Holies and stay there and once we are in the Holies of Holies so so you can understand you can go in there and you can come out of there right but the prophet of God said we need to go in there and shut the curtains behind us that means closing our eyes to the world it means becoming dead to the world and the things that are of the world I can't help but to think even today in the day before how the Bible tells us that if the love of the world is in you the love of God is not and then God sent the property and said if a speck of the world is in you the love of God is not and I'm saying these things not in a critical way but I want you to examine yourself I want you to see where or where you're standing tonight because you are either in the holy place the outer court the holy place are the Holies of Holies and when you're in the outer court you're Christian when you're in the inner court you're Christian when you in the Holy hole of Holies you are Christian when you become a Christian you become a Christian eternally hello that's what the Bible said you have passed from death unto life but listen what good what what what trophies will we receive what we Wars where we receive if we are in the outer Court Christian if we are just in the inner court right the candlesticks we can call and name every prophet but understand just like the lights went out for the Lutheran's the lights went out for the Methodists hello and the lights can go out in this age if you allow it to but that light those selling lights were not there to place us in darkness those seven lights were there to give light to us that we may be able to go from that court into the inner them the most holy of holy court and you and I must understand it all depends we must understand that God ain't joking we can say what I can't do it I can't make myself desperate I can't make myself love God but one thing for certain if you don't feed on the word you're going to get weak if you don't listen to the tapes you're going to get weak and I know for a fact it's sometimes a battle not every day but there's a battle when I listen to a tape or listen to music or it's it's always something trying to battle me keep me rather from listening to the word or reading the word of praying the word praying to the word and you and I must realize they meant that's the devil the devil always make himself real but do we realize that's what it is sometimes we might think oh I'm just lazy or I'm backslidden and if you confess you're backsliding you're backslidden whatever you say out of this mouth is what you become hallelujah and the thing that we must do tonight is repent from all of the negative things that have come at our mouth concerning our salvation you and I must repeat from the murmuring and complaining when God is leading us you and I couldn't have a a greater leader than the Holy Ghost it is the Holy Ghost as leading us and guiding us is that right and the Bible tells us he's a good shepherd you and I have been placed in this age not to stay in a pillow Coster RAM but we have been placed in this age to go into the Holies of Holies somebody's gonna do it God has never left himself without a witness somebody is gonna do it somebody is going to accomplish it and you need to say I am that one don't look at circumstances God looks at confessions if you can confess I am a champion you can confess I am bride if you can confess I'm more than a conqueror don't look at your failures you need to give the Holy Ghost something to work with and God can't work with negatives he needs positive everything must come in a positive way I am you never you never God said you know I might be he said I am and you and I must speak the eye and language right not the devil's language I am I am this I am bride I am more than a conquerer I am and I can say it like this I will accomplish what God has set before me I am a saint that will and shall and am will die in the Holies of Holies you got to confess it is that right when David faced Goliath he said listen the devil tried to say I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that and then David said who is this uncircumcised Philistine huh you're not even or God but I'm gonna tell you I know I am and I am and I will cut your head off this day I love David because he didn't even have a sword to cut his head off with so he use Goliath's sword to bring the word to pass so you and I must realize we have an authority and as we say an authority is not tough like calm I got I said using some kind of witchcraft or some kind of negative power Authority means that I have the the power or the the right to speak a word and you must obey for an example the policeman may be a little small what type of person but if he's got the badge he's got the uniform on guess what he has an authority over you and you respect that authority why because if you don't you are in trouble see so even the underworld knows that Jesus is God of the living and the dead peepers know the Bible said at the name of Jesus demons tremble hallelujah and that is why the devil do not want us to go into this Holies of Holies because when we get into the Holies of Holies we become the full name of God I was saying again when you get into the Holies of Holies you become the full name of God is that right as he is we are in this present world and the devil don't want us to achieve that name because he realized that when this name of Christ is completed in you he must bow who you don't you know you've never seen brother and I'm screaming at a demon he just said come out of you never seen Jesus screaming at a demon no he didn't half the hollow that demon heard him come on Solari listen Lazarus was dead for four days somewhere and Jesus said Lazarus come forth he was dead his body was dead his his natural body couldn't hear but that uh-uh-uh-uh-uh that name the power of that name before he was even crucified went wherever Lazarus was and brought him back that's the power of the name of Jesus Christ that is why the Bible said the whole family of heaven and earth is named after him neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name given among men whereby what about we must be saved other than the name of Jesus Christ so it's that name y'all understand what I'm saying see this divine nature is the very character of his name you understand me oh you see a pig it's gonna be a pig I don't care how much you uh-uh-uh-uh dress him up he is a pig he's carrying the nature of the pea right remember jesus said go tell Herod that old Fox because by nature he was a fox he did the things that a fox would do see and so you must understand when you get the nature of God on the inside of you you become God on earth because God is in you on earth you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past ye walked according to the course of the world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience all of us know that and whom also we had our conversation in time past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires and of the flesh and of the mind and we were by nature the children of Wrath even as others we know that we know the nature that was in us there was nothing good about us we did wicked things because we were wicked that was the nature of the world even though the seed of God was in us that's why we hated it we wheat there's a time in our life that we did not have pleasure in those things anymore you know why because God quickened something in you it was always God and it will always be God huh look what look what Ephesians said Paul says guess what this was he said but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us Eve we were what dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved hallelujah and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace you are saved through faith and not of yourselves hello that's what you must understand you cannot save yourself but if you are led by the Holy Ghost he will lead and guide you into the Holies of Holies cuz he is the only one you know what brother Branham I just read it he talks about that pillar fire everybody in in different in these different ages did not even have the ability of doctor let me ask you a quick time oh jeez no brother says whatever you do stay away from the pillar of fire but you know what he was working with trying people trying to be a prophet you see but the pillar of fire instance Shekinah glory what are you thinking here the pillar of fire is this a kind of God that's the life that's the light that was behind the veil that was what covered Adam and Eve it was the Shekinah glory does somebody help me here so we are supposed to press into the Shekinah glory that is our privilege it is our right to go there is that okay but it's true it's true read your message I sometimes wonder where people listening what are they listening to we're not trying to be something that we're not will Braun Eagles you don't stay a baby eagle you grow up you become a for maturity go right and that's what this whole thing about is about that you and I may become a fool mature and a Christian and Christians mean to be christ-like and because you Christ like that means the same spirit is Bible says if that same spirit being you that was also in Christ Jesus Heller the same some kind of glory only inside of Jesus Christ is what made him what he was and is and that same Shekinah glory that shank same pillar fire is supposed to live within you it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me not of works lest any man should boast hello how many times I was telling to my brother I said I fasted many days at times and I'm not boasting I have fasted I have prayed all night at times I have prayed hours after times and things of that nature but it doesn't come by doing that even though though we supposed to do that you know when it comes by the grace of God it comes by what their leadership of the Holy Spirit not by my power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord it's all God it will always be God we just blessed because he chose to work with us yeah for we are his workmanship are you his workmanship that means God ain't through with me yet he's working on us and he ain't through with us yet and one thing I love about this craftsman he does not give up on his work he is faithful to complete that would he have be gone in you and me oh I feel like shouting but I'm trying to take my time see for we are his workmanship created we're in Christ Jesus unto good works that means you gotta be in him and he's got to be in you that's the only way he can work get it he can't build somewhere no you got to be in him and he must be in you the first work starts in you and that in you brings you into him you understand me he first comes in you and that in you begins to work in you inside out right to bring you into him hallelujah that's why the high priest was the only one that could actually go behind the veil so you and I must be in the high priest we must be in the high priest is that right brother Branham said it like this he said the bride of Jesus Christ is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit his spirit so the Holy Ghost in us makes us priests and kings Oh somebody help me here for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them the battle is not over per se in this world sometimes we think oh I can't go any further or lord have mercy all of the things that's coming at me right now I I just feel like so renin and my question is what do you surrender up to you know nothing can satisfy you like Jesus you never love anything because you don't taste it of him you can never taste anything that tastes better than Jesus Christ hey somebody help me so you got to realize Amen that you and I must have this revelation of ourselves that you and I have been chosen and elected to go into the Holies of Holies hmm is that right our high priest could not just be in high priest he had to be chosen and elected right and you must understand that every office of God is chosen and elected by God you didn't choose to be there that gift was given to you before the foundation of the world and if God has called you to be bride it doesn't make any difference how long it takes he's gonna bring you there is that right oh it's the truth sometimes it takes a long time for a real Christian to understand that he was really born to be one is that right look look look you know throughout all the history all look what can't God then just choose virgins to do his will he had prostitutes that did his will huh he had women who who engaged in incest and they were all part of him why because he chose it to be so so that you and I can see no matter what kind of form and style of life we had before the word was quickening us hallelujah uh-huh we still was chosen of God to do his perfect will God is the only one that can transform a man and a woman and make them virgins is that right remember you saw her brother was how could I be a virgin remember Matthew 25 only calls for virgins thigh were wise and five words foolish and you answered to that call so God called you a virgin you didn't call yourself that God said it is that right Jeremiah your prophet God Jeremih understand after I'm a prophet no God called him a prophet and because you and I heard this message God said you're a virgin you're a virgin right if I were wiser I was foolish now what are you when you see this this light when you see this light this light is guiding you lead you into something you following this message right you following this message because this message will lead you into the Holies of Holies keep eating on that word is that right hallelujah keeps feeding on the way or keep believing that word keep applying that word amen and the Holy Ghost in you will make the change yeah the Holy Ghost will I feel the presence of the Lord tonight the Holy Ghost will make the change but whatever you do I don't care how bad you feel I don't care what the devil say you are never stop feeding on the word feed yourself strengthen yourself and God will do the quickening is that right absolutely they're old Lord understand the revelation of this Bible this is the only we live Christians live not by education of the Bible we live by revelation of the Bible because in that Bible it revealed the Bible reveals to us who we are hallelujah now think about it Davis said his mercies endure forever he said they are renewed every morning see so the devil is already defeated he didn't say his grace is greatest Ange but his mercies when you guilty and you're wrong hallelujah and that mercy never runs out renewed every morning no matter how much time you Yami the times you see in a day tomorrow is a fresh pot o go to God David knew what he was talking about he knew so I'm saying all these things so that you can understand that God does not haphazard ly save us the Bible said he saves us to the uttermost he he's not just saying oh our hope it happens oh he's already done it it is a finish worth about said even before the world he said in from the beginning it was already finished it's all our brothers when you said oh I got a seat up there already with my name on it nobody can take that seat it's reserved you've got a name you got a seat it's already reserved nobody can take that seat but you is that right remember that lady came to Jesus and she said Lord grant that one of my son sit on your right and hand and the left when you get up there he says all he said that's not given to me to give it's already given those seats are already taken huh so you got to understand that you are there already and nobody can take your place but it must be a revelant you got to believe this you must believe it hearing about your works though we work we work because we love him he leads us to work is that right jesus said i can't do nothing except i see the father doing it so god has to work and i work here the - right so god works so you can work hallelujah and so you say well what do you mean brother listen now you never know the Bible just by some cold hearted reading it you've got to read the Bible in the spirit you've got to be in the mood of reading you've got to love to read it and the Bible is written so that the wise smart educated will never understand it Jesus thank God is that father I thank thee that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent and will reveal them to be such as we'll learn oh I'm so glad that you don't have to be somebody in this world to know God you just have to have a willing heart and God will go to dealing with that willing heart if you are willing whoa everybody gotta have a willing heart in here he said got a willing heart come on somebody you would have never gotten this far without that willing heart hmm the strength of the Holy Spirit should be in every member in the church what do you mean strength the power of the resurrection the light that Jesus gave for the church should be operating in every member of it the body the strength salt will only save if it's couldn't if it contacts but it must contact and if the church get that burden on their heart to contact someone get someone saved then the strength coming back into the church again and into the people now a minister could not bring a revival there is no great preacher can bring revival he does he doesn't pack it with him and the only thing he can do is just be lawyer to God and his work and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now remember about shooting now revival isn't adding new members to the church is reviving that which we we've already got to revive me to bring back is that right so the preacher can't bring it no matter how much you try it has to be the people in the church it has to be the family of God we must we must press to be United and knitted together and as long as the enemy can keep us all with our separate programs he's God is defeated because the house divided cannot stand one thing about the early church they had one goal and that was to make the world see that Jesus Christ is alive and well hallelujah and you and I can see how the this bride this church that we call bride and then they come up with so many different doctrines oh oh you got to do this and you got to do that you know after a while they'd say you know uh uh uh yeah I don't know what they're gonna say next but my point is it is a destroy action from the devil we think that all because I believe this that's gonna save me oh no sure whether I clap on beat or clap off beat that's not what saves me where is that in the Bible but the Bible only said nothing about clapping on the left or the right he said clap your hands all you people shout with the voice of triumph that's what it is and now people say oh you gotta clap only and if you clap off beat that's what the devil where is that in the scripture where did brother Branham ever say that huh never said it what about a man or woman who don't have rhythm they clapped whatever whenever they won't do it was just that stuff that people want to add and they don't know when they add to it they literally are cutting themselves out of the rapture not that they might be lost no no no they'll be say but because they add they must suffer the plagues that's coming on the world and you and I must understand that we have the authority we have the power God says go into that Holies of Holies don't you stop for nothing I don't care if you got a crawl in there slide in there wounded and you can barely make it but get in there how it's your privilege is what God desire of you that divine nature is what God wants to see he wants to see all of us declare is no longer I that live but Christ that lives in us that's what he was not just some kind of a church hallelujah is that okay you and I must understand that we have a strength but many of us fall to Delilah like like Samson right we all go through it but God is already saying all you got to do is cry out over the Lord ones law Samson couldn't change who he was and let me tell you something no matter how bad you seem to be or how bad you think you are if God don't call you to be Brides there is no quitting in you you can't help it you gonna throw us you're gonna hunger you gonna call on his name Amen even though both your eyes have been put out God's gonna have that thing in your heart were you gonna call on him and you're gonna gain the victory see and the thing that I love about it Samson was wasn't some big bulky man he was a little shrimp a man maybe a little curly head and look like a little but one thing he has seven full power he had seven locks Amen that represented those seven virtues which are eight with God right because it was God who came and anointed his strength hello come on somebody it wasn't his hand the Covenant was the hair but because he had the hair and then God could anoint him that's why the or don't let no woman cut you here you gonna lose your strength that's nothing that ain't it the power wasn't in the hair the power was in God and the Covenant hallelujah and we have our unconditional covenant and the power is in that not in how much you do this how much you do that it is the Covenant it is what God determined to put before us it will always be amazing grace hallelujah think about it now man you might not think much of yourself but you're the kind of man God can use you're the kind of person that God can use because when Samson knew it went him there was no scientist to say look at this man he can carry those barn doors right he could take the gates of Gaza no that wasn't a man that was an anointing that was a power that was God hallelujah that's why Paul said it like this we can do all things through Christ with who strengthens us ah that I can do a whole thing no you leave that out then you leave that other part out you done it is Christ who strengtheneth us continue to strengthen us that's why we're able to stand here later see you mm-hmm lord have mercy it's just okay you know because I want you to know you have an authority but until you must accept it you must accept it right you know it's like a pasture I'm a pastor I gotta ask you can I do this can I do that what are you talking about you're the pastor you tell me right Oh policemen it'll stop you from but can I give you a ticket can I - I'm gonna give you a ticket I have the authority to do that that's me that's who I am you are the Bride of Christ you are the children of God you're not a saint and you have a right by the spoken word to call tell that devil God says no right you got to be sick and tired of being sick and tired huh you got to do that hey man how many times when desperation strikes listen let me tell you something the devil like I said he tried to take me out but there was no fear I don't fear being lost I'm saved right I know where I'm going and you know doesn't matter what he tries to do I get up have y'all noticed that but it's not by my power it's not by my mind is by His Holy Spirit Satan came dude he can attack me gotta give him time to do things but he can't stop the Commission he can't stop and that's with you - whatever God is ordain you to do you're going to do it it will happen it will happen just like I we told that that preacher not the preacher the doctor today you know Keith went with me and it's true God ordained this here I go into this doctor several times didn't even know he was a Christian and he didn't know I was a pastor because thing was moving so fast we couldn't talk to each other but today we talked to each other and found out we were brothers you understand me nothing works in vain nothing is in vain everything has a purpose and when God causes all allow Satan to do thing he said what brother looks I don't fully understand it let me take you to the scripture so you will write God told Naomi and her husband and all them y'all y'all y'all going down to Moab you said it wasn't God it was God whether they heard that voice or not something drove them down other than the family cuz everybody didn't leave his Bethlehem and then and Israel everybody didn't leave but Naomi a husband they left hello and they went down there and God hand was in it because Ruth was there you understand me Ruth was there and she was a vital part of God's thinking and listen Naomi and her husband they perhaps felt backslidden and everything else and in the natural I they were but when you are chosen of God backslidden or not you saved brother books you better be careful it is true if God has already chosen you to be saved you're saved nothing can stop that it's never been what you do it's always been what he does for you now he wants you to do right he wants you to tell tell everybody about him right is that right come on somebody saw messed up and Saul wasn't even God's choosing it was people chose Saul because he looked and stood tall and at the end of the day he messed up and guess what God saved him hello come look at Solomon Solomon was God's choice and at the end of the day Solomon messed up are you gonna see him there absolutely Oh what are you saying what I'm saying who's gonna lay in a charge of God's elect it is God who elects you and it's God who's chosen you it is God who saw you who you shared his blood it's real and the devil don't like it it's real he just just Dido he doesn't like this thing why because this message shared light on every aspect of God's salvation why God did this and why he did this why he allowed that and why he did this now we know they didn't know but now we know and all of this food was given to the bride so that you can see there is no possible way for the bride herself to be lost because she her name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world thousand when ever before the foundation I don't know how many eons it was before God said let there be light I don't know but my name was there he thought of you he thought of me now I'm trying to get us to see if God has shouted this thing put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life do you think God is gonna say well you know they're just not gonna make it into that Holies of Holies you know I I just might as well give up on her see you must understand the only way you make it because God won't give up on you now we might give up on him but he'll never give up on us Oh somebody he didn't he didn't he didn't just oh well um I choose them but I don't know whether they ever come up to measure he couldn't make it happen Samson failed badly in the worst way women and caring on women and Solomon did too and guess what God made it happen don't figure it out it can't be figured out it's God and you and how to thank God for His amazing grace hey I'm almost done just give me a few more minutes the Bible says though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the wall shall rise against me in this will I be confident you hear what I'm saying that devil was afflicted my body but I was confident that whatever would take place next I would be okay I'm telling you there was there was no fear and that was the worst pain I ever experienced in my life I just wanted it to stop and the more I wanted it to stop the more intense it became I thought I was having a heart attack in my back because all my pain was in my back down my lower arm and everything else amen up and down my neck it was terrible and these people are asking me all these questions oh don't you know I knew all I know is I was being tested and every time something negative came out of my mouth I couldn't help but follow it I'm a apology oh I'm so sorry I said it that way I'm so sorry no you don't have to the paramedic said you don't have to apologize but even so I saw the power of pain and I thought to myself if we go through which we will some of us through a pressure or squeeze see because when the pain come all you wanted to do is just get rid of it you know I said well now I kind of have a little glimpse of what a woman feels like when she's having a baby she want the pain to stop it doesn't stop when she wants it to stop it continue on until it's accomplished what it came for y'all healing I'm saying I can understand why this woman don't want you jacking at her while she's in hey you know what you know you don't hear that you just want somebody to relieve you of what's going on here see you listen and then we look at the woman when she's screaming in Holland like man she's all out of control you've never had that kind of pain pain I respect pain now I respect pain now I know understand why people torture people cuz they tell you what when that pain hits you you want it to stop if it means I got to tell a secret to get it to stop see some people fall under desperation it's the truth it only the strong can all overcome that somebody who's strong you understand me so I'm trying to say it like this we have looked I have looked at many things in in the church foxes Book of Martyrs well you haven't suffered that pain and if it Christ ain't real you can't do it mmm is that right that's what that's what the devil says oh you don't shelter job so much just let me touch him one time just let me just let me get at him I'll prove to you hearing what he says he is God said go ahead and do it God knew that Joe can handle the pain before he job ever entered into it God knows how much you can thing is that right the scripture said he will not put no more on you than you can bear mm-hmm listen to me hurry up the Bible said that the end of the Lord and campus around about them that fear him and delivering them see when the devil was trying to take my life you know what God did he delivered me and I don't care what nobody says I know that I came through because of prayer I believe that when it was all said and done they gave me this look they said we don't have nothing to give you so we can look at these pieces pay for everything in your normal your cholesterol ain't high your blood pressure your work everything looks so good so why were you ever in here you took an old stress stance they said oh do you want that medicine nerd don't know don't give me that let me go to old time way I got on that treadmill and it seems so simple I felt like I was almost playing Fame went out I'm telling you they said they've never seen it before I want my nurses and all the time I work here I've never seen somebody come up with a hundred percent on their stress test like that that wasn't me that was God God had cured God had healed God had delivered and I wasn't stupid enough to think that I could do it it was God who did it all no weapon formed against you shall prosper it doesn't matter what it is it cannot prosper that's the word huh and the devil might set up a trap but guess what God is able to break the fall of snake whoo Jesus hmm how many I'll believe that the angel of the lord encamps out yeah I believe that do you see him yes not with these natural eyes but by but what he does and how he does it amen hallelujah hallelujah Zechariah two and five says for I said the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire roundabout and will be the glory in war the mist of her hallelujah even Zachariah knew by prophecy that God would be the glory on the inside in you in you hallelujah I got one more if this okay I want you to know you have an authority and authority that you have is god-given but it is no good if you don't use it hello now somebody break in your house and this is maybe a bad scenario but you've got a big gun right and they break in your house and they don't have nothing now who has the authority hey if they come in your house and see you with this big gun guess what they gonna home they will surrender not to you but the gun is holding that is the authority this is the authority the Word of God is the authority when the devil see that you know how to handle this word he grumbled himself huh he knows you gonna shoot this gun you're not worried about it to bake the cake you know how to handle it right now if you shake him with it he might try to approach you cuz he know you're not confident you got all this weapons are in your hand but you're not confident it's gonna work all you got to do is speak the word you make a move and you out of here I guarantee you here listen right so you and I must understand we have the authority let's put it this way you got a headache now you can suffer with today and continue to suffer with this headache and continue to suffer with this headache but you have authority because you and I know that the headache is a spirit it is a demon that comes to torment you the devil comes to steal kill and destroy he is a demon headache called him headache but you had the authority to make headache go you can welcome him if he want to and you can say all my headache is just getting worse I'm never see you don't say you can make it worse and he says all come on there I need some reinforcement this is the worst she's ever had so we got to make sure it's the worst or you can say headache I'm speaking to you right now as a son and daughter of God you must leave and I command you to leave now if you say that with conviction and and you know what you're talking about that devil will leave before you know it I've spoken to my own body I speak to it when a pain or ache or something no no no no you can't stay up in here right with the stripes I'm healed you got to preach it you got appreciate your own body is that right that's the word Adam I have given you this garden and I want you to subdue it he had the authority over the garden that was the land you have the authority over this land you must speak to it is that the truth let me say like that like Jesus day no man take it's my life but I lay it down and guess what I'm gonna pick it up again he spoke it he spoke it he believe it and it happened why he had a scripture he could go by I will not let his flesh see corruption either way I leave his soul in hell that was the scripture you have a word that that what God heals all diseases what Moe quote did this go oh just love it I hope I can see him coming I believe there anyhow I just hope I live to see the day when I see him coming from Arizona across the world and join hands together go to meet him in the air what a day that would be my whole heart yearns for that realizing that atom bombs hydrogen bombs cobalt bombs hanging in the hangar hands of wicked enemies some fanatic could just destroy this world in a few hours and completely overnight even already got the weapons to do it with and it's just in the hands of ungodly sinful people right who would do it just just go do it with it that's all just infant infidel a Daleks and then what a day we're living in then God gets his church ready oh and we could just lay aside flesh now and open our eyes and see what God is doing now I know we've got to have things well recognize that just as fanaticism stuff rises up but remember the same things taking place just before the real Jesus appeared in the first time and we're bound to have it much more just before the appearing the second time so that'll only give life to the believer just be ready for the hour is at hand is that all right what is it when a man breaks through the veil into the Shekinah glory now the world calls him a fanatic they can't see what's wrong but behind there there is no beauty of him he might not pronounce his words right he might not dress just right he might not dress in clergy clothes she might not dress the way they think she ought to it maybe but you see inside behind that badger skin behind that humans in there if there's a kind of glory and there is the power and there is the word and there is the shewbread and the Shekinah glory which is the light that makes light that ripens grain just say that to your neighbor right listen so you and I can understand that what God is looking for we're not we can't stay here in the place that we're in we just can't stay here we've got to go further and remember the brother who said like this an accepting God's provided way he said God's Word is always what he wants to see vindicated it was priest Malachi 4 preached it but God want to see it vindicated he wants to see the people who can go into the Holies of Holies and you know what it is it's just as easy it's accepting your salvation if you accept it for you God can take you there and if you don't know how to say lord help me accept it give me faith to accept this is my calling to go into the Holies of Holies and stay there you say you've seen people that can take the word of God and they just make it live for them and others come right back with the same word and can't do nothing with it it's on conditions see it's on conditions you love the Lord less than others Richard mercy he's good to us we got to see that we're part of His grace and mercy plan we're not like the children of Wrath guarding he didn't design to us to throw us into a fire I don't believe that uh-uh we're children of the day we're children of the light you're hearing this message believing this message has already identified you on who you are what you are capable of doing but you got to believe it if you don't eat it if you don't read it if you don't study it if you do not listen you must feed yourself every day I don't care if it's the same tape over and over again because I'm gonna tell you something these tapes live they live words come off and you think oh my god he just saw what I said he just heard what he was right there because we're not listening to a man it's a voice in a voice that's God in that voice and I've seen brother Bentham God through that voice say things to me like wow right how many times I prayed Lord lead me to the right message and I go right there and things that I'm going through are things that I need to preach or things that gonna put everything together is right there only God can do that out of all of those tapes and then find me Scripture I don't have to find Scripture God leads me to every scripture I need for a message for myself hmm god is good thank you brother reach for those quotes who sent me hey good wonderful you know and and y'all you know what I'm gonna use that bye if the Lord tarries Sunday if I nothing happens and we don't make a rapture we don't go in the rapture we will make a rapture I mean you know I'm saying things normally happens I want to use those because I'm gonna tell you something I don't think we realized what we got up against us sometimes we just don't realize what we you got to understand that all of the age is filth and dirt and demonic power has now been poured in on you on you all ready Terry spirits they've been poured onto you and if you don't go into the Holies of Holies those things are going to stick they're gonna plague you not because of what you did but because of what somebody else did before you his word is true it can't come back boy is that right you know I never understood a lot of things but now things are opening my mind opening my eyes and then when I when I see things that happening even with my own children and I see okay I've seen this before and I can point back to a relative but you see what it is you caught you either on the outer court the inner court or the Holy of Holies and the only true safe place is in that Holies of Holies that's right brother soundproof nothing can get through on you nothing can stop you because you can't even hear the voice of the devil how many got on heard the devil talk you understand me if you got if you know anything about serpents all they can do is sound like a static radio What did he say you came here you came him understanding that's the way it's supposed to be with a true believer when Satan speak all you get is static you love the Lord Heavenly Father we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you've been better to me than I've been to myself Lord you're just so real it's so good to us and you spoke that I've never seen it like that before the only true safe place is in the Holies of Holies man can't affect you there man can affect you in the outer court man can affect you in the inner court but in the Holies of Holies there come a new creation it is the only place hallelujah we're dead rod can boy and bring forth fruit help us dear Jesus call us continue to drive us or lead us whatever it takes to get us behind there and once we could get there Lord seal us close the door to those of us we need you more than we ever needed you before it is so dark Lord you feel the darkness we deal with the darkness every day every moment of the day but father had it not been in your light that the scripture says Lord and we did not have hope you know we would have given up Lord hallelujah but Lord our desire is to live in the land of the living we believe that we ordained for this mission we believe that we have were coming little by little to that goal there's no turning back there's no turning around no matter how many times we were wounded how many times we're strike which we are struck with it with Satan's blows we really believe and know that it's true that we will come to our completion in you and by you Thank You Heavenly Father for that great work of hallelujah a redemption that you are doing in us bless your people Lord give them the mind set their eyes like a flint knowing that they we don't have time to look to the left or right set our eyes continually on you lord help us down in your name Jesus Christ we pray water Maricar we serve oh mighty card readers Oh Diego and heaven and earth oh my ramani Cosby sir hallelujah Otto mighty God we serve holy angels and heaven in earth oh what a mighty God our is die will interface with Thanksgiving in my oh I will enter his grave this way I will show that the Lord I will rejoice [Music] hallelujah he had where he has me now what I will regard for yes baby I [Music] [Music] I want to just use our sister my brother Cam's wife as an example she's not here I can't even think of her name right now but she just came to my mind I remember when my sister she even came here and one of her hips were lower than the other and every day she confessed with his stripes I'm healed I mean she's had three children already now you ought to see her walking now straight right little by little that hip had to obey her y'all here we don't say hey little by little that hip had to obey because she buying that spirit sometime it doesn't done you may not see it directly but remember the Prophet God said when you speak to a mountain it has to move if you believe the mountain moves that mountain up it has to obey he said it may be one grain at a time saying one loose and moving but it moves at the end of the day it has to go yeah I'm saying but you got to confess it you got to believe it you got to give the Holy Ghost something to work with the Holy Ghost can't work with negativity now he gained work with oh I don't believe in I'm not shooting all that negative stuff you gotta say I am I am I am you got to put God to work he's a positive not a negative hallelujah you said brother looks are you I have been guilty of feeding the negative atmosphere for the devil and guess what you know it's true when you feed it it grows hallelujah that's right I don't care God is the creator huh one more testimony remember the situation about the the baby with the clubfoot or whatever kind of footie hair and and and debate they had to put a prayer cloth on the baby and nothing was happening I mean the baby foot stayed the same until there was a piece of thread left that's what's all left but a piece of thread and when somebody says well it just looked like it ain't gonna happen I'm paraphrasing it reminds we'll take that piece of thread off there says no no no no we gonna leave that thread on there cuz he said it God said that foot would get well put that piece of cloth and we're gonna keep it there that was their final test and the next day when they woke up that baby foot was straight c.carter take you all the way to that last little right there when it looked like it is all over they ain't gonna happen that's when you say yes sir he said it is going to happen I believe that I don't care if you sound like a parent every day with the stripes I'm healed or if you have to say speak something every day when you wake up you ought to say if they don't say you ain't bribed you ought to say every morning when you wake up thank God Lord you woke up your bride this morning call it

into eternity and eternity all this nonsense doesn't even exist it's not there you're not gonna find pain in the 8th dimension or in that dimension where life eternal is in that Holies of Holies no
