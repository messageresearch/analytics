all of your heart god bless you this morning let's stand together let's get right into the word of the lord let's turn in the bible to ephesians chapter one so appreciate the lord appreciate everything god's doing foreign if you need that you can have it all right don't forget the wedding now 12 p.m i know there's speed too that won't forget it all right let's read now ephesians chapter 1 i want to speak to you this morning upon the final inspection now you realize that all of us are being inspected by the holy spirit and there is coming a final inspection and there will be a time when everything that god has been doing inside of you and me [Music] amen that's right now ephesians chapter 1 verse 9. having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself [Music] and what it really boils down to what it really comes to er is we have to learn to trust is amen everything in this life is temporal which means it's subject to change now watch your verse 10 and then let's pray the both which are in heaven which let's pray together heavenly father what a privilege it is to be gathered in the house of god lord we love you so very much we are so very happy to be a part of a program in which you are in total control of the beginning of the middle and of the very end thank you lord for allowing us to be caught by the grace and the love of god that we can transition from where we are today where we will be tomorrow we may not know what tomorrow is [Music] he was absolutely he was going to obey the preacher every word teacher said stand up amen hallelujah so we don't want to be that extreme man you get tired after a while and you want to sit down now let's let's look for just a moment a picture i want to paint a picture and in your mind have to walk around so i'm gonna come around you now you realize that when the spirit of god when he first began dealing with the creative work the sun and the moon the sun wasn't just set up there i've been learning french i'm understanding a little bit of you so lay that son i got that one amen hallelujah anyways we we realize everything even the flowers it serves a purpose and what we need to realize nothing that god said in this earth when i was a boy we went to a sister's house one night and we got to discussing this about the planets and i said to the lady i said why did god create all them planets out there if you tried to pack every believer on this earth you wouldn't have enough rooms on top of worlds and with the curse lifted off of this universe you might go live some people think i'm from mars i might end up living there one day hallelujah but everything serves a purpose now if we can believe that about the sun if we can believe that about the planets if we can believe that from the greatest of circumstances [Music] now if god wants us then is it to walk in a manner that the holy spirit is free can project his life through us that's what we then i must believe that even the smallest of details is important and significant come on the word say man you can say it i learned in french it's amen and in english should say amen now i want you to think about something if the holy spirit then see the sentence if he's drawing a picture we'll say you know if you got a pin on you let me show you just an example of what i mean anybody got a pen somebody got a pen here shortly to god give me a pen thank you buddy let me give you a small example now i'm no artist but but in my church services my art is picasso got it all right i'm going to draw you a face who is it hey any of you what's missing from this picture details you don't know whether this is a man you don't know whether this is a woman all right all right let me give you a little bit what color are the eyes just say blue or black or something just pick something black eyes it's got dark eyes all right so it may not be a white man i don't know if it's a white man it may not be a white woman we don't know much about the details how's it smelling monk the details all right now watch let's get a little bit further in can you hear me yes i can now because i got ears does it matter thus far does it matter to this person is i'm talking about the details now all right now let's let's go a little bit further i'm going to give this one curly hair well that's a nice pin man or woman from um now we're getting down somewhere wow details all right now let's just say this is one of the african brothers or sisters we'll say it's one of the african cities now i'm just going to do like a little shade now this just represents the skin color all right details all right this is one of our black sisters then all right but does the details matter but this this poor lady ain't got no eyebrows oh it ain't no big deal forget the eyebrows would you walk around without any eyebrows you know what i'm trying to say to you don't you the details matter so let's give it some eye eyebrows all right but how's it blank ain't got no eyelashes ain't got no eyelids oh no now we're getting down to business now do the details matter did what's in a nose would you live without ears that's because i leave you for something but it's just an ear would you live without eyebrows would you want to live this life without eyelids but it's just small details but the details matter the small things serve a purpose how's this little how's this sweet little sister right here how's she going [Music] she ain't got no teeth all right so we're going to give her some those oh that's better but she's got some teeth now now she can chew she can eat fufu hallelujah fufu is good i like fufu any food cookers in here [Music] glory to god ain't none of y'all made no food for brother ben no did you you're gonna have to fix that next time i come here [Music] the details matter when it comes don't don't let me stab you in the eye now okay all right duck your head thank you if the details matter important then no wonder jesus said when it comes to the word those tiny things now when we look at our lives then regardless you realize what you're doing you're looking at yourself without any eyelids song you're just looking at yourself in a generic view you're just seeing yourself as oh i'm just a nobody hey man i don't care if you're a white man [Music] god has put his mark of love and grace on you if the details don't matter then why is it some of us brethren would prefer one type of woman over another tip i i better stay out of trouble i ain't going to say nothing about y'all but my wife she's got dark hair my fam ela and she's a short little thing i didn't want to marry a woman taller than me oh god we're gonna have to do some repent in this place you people don't start getting serious with me [Music] can i ask why some of you then stand in the mirror for an hour making sure everything is just so-so i bet some of you sisters yes you probably re-changed your outfit four different times before you come here look they're laughing already see what i'm talking about are you guilty details matter to us the little things are important remember what jesus said he said the literature boxes so if the details are important then when it comes to being a christian god doesn't want us to go around without any definition i mean what kind of real bride would we be without any eyelids how can i handle the spoken word if i ain't got no mouth to talk i'll just give you an example when babies are born now some of you young people may not know this one of these days you'll have young and geno one of these days and and the baby will be born the first thing you'll do you'll smile at it of course that is if you haven't passed out during the birth then you'll pick that baby up and mom to be what's the first thing we do to that baby we go over and start counting fingers and toes don't we and uh part of her thumb kind of grew like that on the side it's just a common birth defect of course they now the next time annelise gets here don't go looking for that thumbs up she also has that little thing that hangs down the back of your throat i wouldn't dare try an english you could probably get in french i wouldn't dare try next you can't either he said i can't get it either she had two of those it split and one day she was ah [Music] and i looked in her throat i saw that thing hanging down splitting too let me read you a quotation here all right now listen brother abraham says in adoption he said now what is a seal a seal is the first thing to show [Music] you want one let's say what's your favorite car what kind of car you like a red one big one small one speedy medium you're like a medium car what about you what do you like oh you're a guy come on spit it out uh-huh mustang camaro what you want you want a bmw [Music] hallelujah somebody take a bat boy an offering what kind of car you like i'll be praying for you as of tonight i'm teasing now what if you got that automobile i'm talking cherry red the shine you know i mean it puts your eyes out it's so pretty and then the seller walked up and said this is a car just for you [Applause] you opened up the front seat and sat down where's the steering wheel would you still buy it that's your turn to say no out you can't say get out in french can you he might be handsome as anything but if he ain't got no holy ghost he's like a car without a steering wheel i mean if you had one of these i'm talking about them big dually forwards that new tailgate that switches about seven different ways i may need to take up an offer for this is over with you got in the front seat of that thing would you still put your money on the table really so do you think that god wants to have a bride that looks pretty good she shines like a church should shine talks like a church should talk come on now preach to me walk like a church should walk but she's missing little details that really matter important you reckon god would still want to buy it as a matter of fact with isaac if he goes to inspecting you and he sees there's no love if there's no grace if you're full of bitterness i like before bts because i'm from a gm town okay i was born in kettering which is a general motors thing and um but a friend of mine is a forward lover he loves us for them he he jumped in the front seat of one of them it's supposed to be a brand new truck and as he got in there he started pulling the shifter like this and it grinded i was trying to talk him into getting the holy ghost i said you mean to tell me you won't drive that car without a proper engine and you say what good is it it's exactly the same way it is with a so-called believer of this man that knows all the quotes they know all these scriptures but they ain't got no going power without the in other words you couldn't blow them out now brother baby said but both of them are sitting there in the driveway both of them full of gasoline i said one had a spark in the other one which car would you drive andrea as a matter of fact which woman would you marry a family which man would you give your heart to kill the one that could say brother said brother say well she has long hair oh that didn't know she wears a long dress does she have a long tongue to match that long hair and long dress long long it looks hey i might buy that set in the house of the lord you know how it is you catch some glances boy she's pretty you know they get with other girls and they go oh he's so handsome [Music] did you get it you didn't do it you didn't do you got to do it you the translator man you got to do it and it might be this thing of oh oh oh she's she's got eyes like like doves well let this shoe come in colomba she's she's got a hair that flows like a flock of goats i've never understood why that was a compliment but i think it is that may be true but if you don't pay attention to the details what you may miss scooby monkey is that in church like this the steering wheel's in place the tires are where they belong [Music] venezuelans the only thing you've got la social scuba devi is a pretty bucket of bolts or a handsome bucket of bolts bucket of parts yeah brother ben what's god looking for then i mean just go i'm glad you asked me i'm going to tell you i've been getting yourself something did you see did you come to church because you're gonna learn it here today what does god want out of me now see here's where we get in trouble but i will remind you [Music] to say well i'm going to fix this right now come on someone talk to me come on i want you to be active this morning is this going to help you if you let it come out if if he thought of me as being a certain person i could read self-help books you young men and women listen brother been close you could go to you could you could sit down with the wisest men in the world have conversations with them tell me what's the matter with me and they might suggest this or that or the other people you might talk to your mom and dad maybe your mama will say i've known you i give birth to you i know all about you today but even though mama may know me from a certain view these parts about me right here mama don't know that daddy don't know that then why is it that many times and i'll just use young people for example i never saw that ah because you were looking at it from your view you didn't see it like god come on at least blink at me every now and then huh you got eyelids i know you do so use them now think you know if then see you though god knows this you see you reckon that god knew my mama like you did you think you knew my daddy yes you think you knew my great great great grandpa do you think he knew my 12 or 14 generations behind him he knew everything that made me choose he knows my history and he knows the history of my history's history so do you reckon that anybody knows you better [Music] [Music] yeah it's got to be more than just somebody that knows how to read from brother branham's message because i don't know you like god almighty knows you and in order for me to preach correctly i have to work from whatever details he wants me to work on you see this is why in church sometimes and you think what in the world is going on knows you need to borrow a pen i'm not the first human being the holy spirit said pick up a pen and write to you still we do the things we do as preachers sometimes god knows the details listen to me don't ever be so silly as i have to stick with whatever the holy spirit tells me to stick it's like the fella that said he preached repent one night preach repent again the next line next night don't you see what it shows up who cares about the details [Music] oh amen and amen and praise the lord that means that god cares about your sadness god cares about what makes you happy god cares about what worries you paul signed and one of the brothers pulled this little fish's insides out and it laid over in a bush dead my grandmother lived about a half hour from the spot you know to prove god cares about little things he cares about the details listen to me i know some of you sitting here this morning in your mind you thank god i don't care about what bothers you you probably feel alone like nobody's listening to give me eyebrows i teach chinese children i tell you that i i uh on the computer i teach little chinese students how to speak english [Music] is after about a month of that i said this is the stupidest thing i've ever done in my life i mean to tell you me dr benjamin norad oh doctor asking if these kids will know where their eyebrows are then the lord spoke to me one day what if you didn't have none i got one little boy his name is mike and mike whenever i ask him what does your fingers touch and they say they touch my mom he likes to tell me ain't got no fingers so he'll put his hands up like this and hide his fingers from the camera let me then what if he wasn't huh what if he wasn't what if god was not a healer is he wait don't be afraid listen to me what if god was everything is he true or is situated to choose except a healer if you had no immune system if you had no white blood cells healing is just a you ever had a root canal they drill into your tooth and rip your your nerves out you ever had that brush your teeth don't ever forget it my brother greg my natural brother i laughed at him i wasn't making fun of him now but i he he made me laugh and he said i believe god's a healer too thank you he said but when that pain hit that tooth i said god you got five minutes or i'm going to the dentist i said amen i've been there see we look at things when it comes to the holy spirit and we say it's just speaking in tongues why that's the littlest of the gifts all right all right fine fine okay you mean you wouldn't want to walk around without them i mean it's not like you can cover them with your mask what y'all looking at me like that for well it's just a little thing that doesn't matter or does it matter so all these other things should matter too our attitude toward one another does it matter you know there are people in this message i can sit on the pews and hold bitterness and resentment in their heart against another human being yet they claim they're going in a rapture sorry friend if that is in here you've missed the details you can't have that in your heart make the rapture. everything has to be right now listen to this he said with one breast off or something like that he said no god's bride will be a pure brother no uh she'll be perfect [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen do you think god cares whenever you feel rotten let's get you to song anybody ever feel right you just wake up in the morning maybe i should say anybody want to try it being honest this morning you ever woke up and just said i hate everybody come on preach to me now let's go come on oh i know i know us holy sanctimonious little angels with our wings and we fly holy holy holy is the lord god almighty i know we never want to admit that but you ever had them days when you're driving down the road and everybody is getting on your nerves the same guy has got in front of you on that same street 48 times but for some reason today i'd like to kill him um i'm the one saying that they're not going to kill you they kill me sometimes our humanity humanity it just gets the best of us you reckon god cares about that i think you'll do upon sunday tonight you reckon he's concerned when we're having a bad day you see what we have to learn about him is the nature of the holy spirit isn't always to work upfront don't let it how did that job just work out that wasn't supposed to work out i mean bunch of agnostics and atheists will just say oh that's just the way life is hogwash lately it was her great grandmother she was an indian native american you know indiana and and you know india look i like congolese when you shout you know you know and she was actually a slave to another man and her grandmother was one as property in a poker game people say oh that's just the way things are how did god know to in order to produce my beautiful little bride sitting back in tennessee [Music] and because god is a hides himself in simplicity because god reveals himself we will overlook those details we will discredit them and say oh that's just the way [Music] of the lord the world how often how quickly how fast we are to dismiss those tiny little things well you know i guess that's just good luck i quit using that ungodly phrase a couple years ago let's wrap up final thing if god is doing an inspection on you and me what's he looking for he said it's no different than working a job no different serving the lord you wonder what you're supposed to do in life go to the balls and say hey you're the one that created i don't know what's worse but i have to ask him all right lord senor if you made me see and you know what i'm all about it is [Music] if we're in the line at mcdonald's more than 15 minutes we're ready to sue the whole corporation mcdonald's i got in line the other day they pulled me to the side for six cheeseburgers burgers and i pulled to the side and there were about 14 people that passed me up with their food smiling from ear to ear i am going to write a letter and i'm going to get old macdonald in his farm [Music] praise the lord we just don't want to be patient the expression the world uses is that the devil is in the details in that as well satan hides himself very subtly too whenever you start going down the downward spiral you know and you start taking a turn for the worse it never starts big it's always some little thing this is all it takes is for somebody to bad-mouth you and you got a good heart right so you don't want to speak back you walk why can't you be like that old boy over there some of them guys that know how to speak up you've got just as much a right to tell him off as he does you satan's in the details i don't that when they were loading cars for the pennsylvania railroad for the pennsylvania railroad pennsylvania country pennsylvania he said the inspector would come through and look at that car and he said he would go inside he would push it anybody ever felt in their life like sometimes god was just uh you get married anybody ever felt like you had those moments when god is wrong now we get upset at that oh god [Music] praise the lord [Music] amen sometimes in our mind we talk about manifested sons of god come on people we don't even know what we're talking about come on be honest with me we're just quoting quotes we honestly don't even know what that looks like for you but what does that look like for me you see we throw these quotes around purple spoken word manifestations but what does that look like right here for me and for you what does that look like perhaps it's not creating squirrels perhaps it's not speaking to storms perhaps it's creating recipes a man your sister should have been hollering praise god some of your brothers i'll tell you brothers cook oh god y'all though let me look at you uh-uh not some of the best chefs in the world are men man get with it maybe it's just taking care of your family being a good wife your father being faithful to what god called you to do

about the outside look exterior it's about the character what kind of character does a person have what character personality so pride says hello i am not not not this is what god made me but that's screwed you my faith says like lucifer i will ascend but if you've got that kind of thing in your heart how many people in this day and age how many people you think you know would quit their job how
