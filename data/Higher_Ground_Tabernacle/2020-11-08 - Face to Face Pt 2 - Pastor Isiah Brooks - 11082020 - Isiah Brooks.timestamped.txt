[24:39] to everybody
[24:41] you know if you got if you got symptoms
[24:42] of any kind
[24:44] that's that that's like covet stay home

[24:54] name
[24:55] ministered up there in a church i better
[24:58] not say the area but he came in he
[25:00] brought the kovic
[25:01] everybody got sick right
[25:05] it's real and one person died

[25:30] there so you'll know
[25:31] that everybody don't have the faith that
[25:33] you have
[25:34] some people are weaker and so we want to
[25:37] protect the church and protect ourselves
[25:40] and and know by god's grace that uh that
[25:42] we're just gonna do
[25:43] uh basically uh what god would have us
[25:47] to do
[25:48] um like i said we don't want to make
[25:50] anybody sick and god has been good to us
[25:52] as far as i know
[25:53] none of us have had it and if you did
[25:55] have it praise the lord
[25:57] you're still here
[26:00] so just uh knowing how god is so good to
[26:04] us
[26:04] and i guess uh
[26:07] we thank god for his grace
[26:12] let's sing the song and we're getting
[26:13] right into the word of god

[31:32] he um he's a friend of mine
[31:36] brother and uh some of you have seen him
[31:38] once or twice
[31:40] but he has uh something he wants to make
[31:42] known to you all
[31:43] after a minister and we'll have him come
[31:46] up during that time
[31:49] so anyhow let's go right into the word
[31:53] i'm glad to see everybody here to this
[31:55] morning
[31:59] we started on a message the other night
[32:01] face to face
[32:02] uh we'll be ministering something
[32:04] different this evening we also will be
[32:05] having communion
[32:07] and so uh this evening against well for
[32:09] those who like to have communion
[32:13] but anyway we we want to start uh the
[32:15] service off
[32:16] uh with the 2nd john the 12th
[32:19] first 2nd john 12 1st
[32:23] where we started uh wednesday wednesday
[32:29] sometimes i get mixed up with the days
[32:32] because of the way things are going
[32:34] but nevertheless amen i really believe
[32:37] that we're
[32:38] getting ready to embrace the greatest
[32:41] thing ever on
[32:42] earth uh a translation of a bride
[32:46] and um with everything's happening the
[32:49] way
[32:50] let me say it like this and some of
[32:51] y'all might not even realize it but
[32:53] in america we don't we've never had a
[32:55] coup
[32:57] but we just experienced one and um but
[32:59] it was done in such a
[33:01] intellectual way many people don't even
[33:03] realize what have taken place
[33:05] but nevertheless god's will be done um
[33:09] you know it's amazing i i could say some
[33:11] things but i don't want to go political
[33:12] here but i want to say by god's grace
[33:15] nothing happens by chance
[33:18] everything is ordained of god and it's
[33:21] never what we desire
[33:22] to be is it's what god has already
[33:25] planned to be
[33:26] and i'm happy you know because we've got
[33:29] a prophet who told us
[33:31] uh what this thing was going to evolve
[33:33] into
[33:35] and now we have by god's grace
[33:39] uh uh a woman who could
[33:42] possibly become the president eventually
[33:46] so and if you if these things don't stir
[33:49] you
[33:50] i don't know what will you know we're
[33:52] living in the last days and
[33:54] and you better understand by god's grace
[33:56] god ain't waiting on nobody
[33:59] the bride has got to make herself ready
[34:02] and if you don't make yourself ready
[34:03] it's nobody's fault but your own
[34:06] and it's not according to your knowledge
[34:08] that god don't care about knowledge
[34:10] that's what got us in trouble from it
[34:11] from the beginning knowledge
[34:14] god is looking for born again believers
[34:16] people who are filled with the holy
[34:17] ghost who's looking
[34:19] and loving his appearance you love the
[34:21] lord
[34:22] you know we look at these things and we
[34:24] i think to myself
[34:26] at what point in time is it going to
[34:28] click in our minds at what point in time
[34:30] we're going to get on fire for god uh
[34:33] because
[34:34] you know it's evident that we're not
[34:36] there yet but don't worry the squeeze
[34:38] will come and
[34:39] that's the part that's the part that i'm
[34:40] afraid uh if there is nothing in you
[34:43] when the squeeze come there is nothing
[34:44] that will come out of you
[34:46] you know peter didn't have it and he
[34:48] followed jesus for three and a half
[34:50] years
[34:51] right and when the squeeze came he came
[34:53] up void
[34:55] he wanted to fight and jesus told peter
[34:58] after you are converted strengthening
[34:59] your
[35:00] brethren i'm so sorry there's no one to
[35:03] come
[35:04] uh okay
[35:07] you're gonna do it okay well
[35:12] we need somebody that's going to
[35:13] interpret a little something you may not
[35:15] be
[35:16] really good at it but some people still
[35:19] need to know what i'm talking about i
[35:20] could see that look on your face like
[35:22] what is he saying so by god's grace amen
[35:26] we'll try our best to take it slow so
[35:29] so uh brother isaac can
[35:32] catch what i'm saying i'm really excited
[35:35] i'm ready i'm really ready to preach
[35:40] but we'll do our best trying to keep it
[35:41] slow mode because
[35:57] having many things to write unto you
[36:10] having many things to write unto you i
[36:13] would not
[36:13] write with paper and ink but i trust
[36:17] to come unto you and speak
[36:20] face to face that our joy
[36:23] may be full
[36:39] okay proverbs 27 19.

[38:56] without spot wrinkle or blemish
[39:12] for god to
[39:25] in order for you to go farther with god
[39:31] because christ has done everything
[39:36] and now it's up to you the bible tells

[39:49] [Music]

[40:12] the left
[40:12] hallelujah hallelujah we have come up
[40:15] through the seven church ages
[40:18] and now the capstone grace grace
[41:16] because the word of god tells us
[41:21] in the 23rd psalm let's turn them down
[41:25] psalms 23.
[41:28] you love the lord let's go who's in
[41:30] medicine yeah god is doing something
[41:47] but we're going to start from the first
[41:50] verse
[41:51] of the 23rd song the lord
[41:55] is my shepherd i
[41:58] shall not want he maketh me
[42:02] to lie down in green pastures
[42:06] he leadeth me beside the steel waters
[42:11] he restores my soul he leadeth in the
[42:15] path of righteousness
[42:17] for his name's sake according to so now
[42:20] he is doing the leading
[42:22] his namesake though i walk through the
[42:26] valley
[42:27] and of the shadow of death
[42:31] no evil thou art with me
[42:35] thyroid and thy staff that will let you
[42:38] know
[42:39] with me why does david work when he says
[42:41] i feel no evil because it is the word
[42:44] that comforts me
[42:47] this is where we're going right here now
[42:50] preparing a table before me
[42:53] to dress the one more in table in the
[42:55] presence of mine
[42:57] enemies on first measure versus thou
[42:59] unknown with my head with oil
[43:01] she won't do it in my tent my cup run it
[43:03] over
[43:04] the board this is where we're going just
[43:06] alone now prepare
[43:08] the table to address it one more time
[43:10] before me
[43:11] divorce in the presence of my enemies
[43:15] in other words god is set a table
[43:21] and when you go to commune it goes and
[43:23] when you go to fellowship with
[43:25] anyone a comfortable community and
[43:27] you're sitting at a table
[43:30] it is it is a communication
[43:33] communication
[43:34] between two or more people uh the
[43:37] entrepreneurship person
[43:38] face
[43:42] and that's why i don't like text
[43:43] messages
[43:47] because i cannot see your face
[43:51] see your face tells the story
[43:56] you can't lie to people
[44:00] if a person knows how to read
[44:03] he knows how to read your face he said
[44:06] your body language gives you away
[44:11] every time you tell a lie a tumor
[44:14] but when you're talking face to face
[44:17] one of the rudest thing for a person to
[44:19] do
[44:29] when you're looking for an answer from
[44:31] them
[44:33] right the moment they look away
[44:45] when a man or a woman is speaking
[44:48] in your
[45:03] it is a discussion description it is
[45:06] something that
[45:07] god has prepared you got to understand
[45:10] this
[45:11] david said you prepared the table before
[45:15] me
[45:44] told us
[45:52] [Music]
[46:23] and you see you say well what do you
[46:24] mean brother brooke if we did uh
[46:38] this is my best artwork that's it
[46:43] that's it more now
[46:47] if it's if it's more detailed than this
[46:50] i'm in trouble i am not an artist
[47:16] the holy spirit can fall in your spirit
[47:19] the sentence we pray the son that is
[47:20] preached and you're still not converted
[47:48] [Music]
[47:51] that is why so many of the pentecostals
[47:55] could have all of those sensations
[47:58] and still reject the message of the hour
[48:02] hallelujah but now we are in the soul
[48:06] of something somebody help me here
[48:08] recommend we are now
[48:10] coming into the place of the throne room
[48:14] is that right it's your soul that god is
[48:18] concerned
[48:20] [Music]
[48:44] the one who says in his heart
[49:13] god in the supernatural
[49:18] [Music]
[49:28] it was no longer
[49:32] [Music]
[49:41] it's the age of perfection because when
[49:44] god
[49:45] strikes the soul what's it called with
[49:47] that gene
[49:48] seed in the soul
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] glory to god you're perfect
[50:02] [Music]
[50:07] don't even hear it right some of y'all
[50:10] make more
[50:24] god or you're going to doubt god oh
[50:28] hallelujah the pressure that's getting
[50:31] ready to come on the earth
[50:34] will cause you to either believe god
[50:37] god
[50:51] who do men say i the son of man
[50:55] jeremiah jeremy elias
[50:59] one of the one of the prophets let the
[51:01] prophet but who do you say that i am
[51:04] and peter said thou art the christian
[51:16] hallelujah is that right because when
[51:19] the pressure came on you
[51:35] on the sentence you have no power by the
[51:38] force
[51:38] to fight the pressure that's coming on
[51:41] the earth
[51:43] do you understand that what we have
[51:46] elected
[51:48] what is now in our solution
[51:50] [Music]
[51:53] of the politics has come to destroy
[51:57] christians
[52:01] hello hello they come to destroy you
[52:04] evie you are the hold up
[52:08] you and i are the hindrance to what they
[52:10] want
[52:13] to believe you me they are coming after
[52:16] you
[52:18] if you don't have the power of the holy
[52:20] ghost
[52:22] you said you're going to do just like
[52:24] peter did that
[52:26] you're going to deny it that you ever
[52:29] knew this message
[52:34] that's why it's important that's
[52:36] important is that right
[52:37] that's invite hope told brother branham
[52:42] uh hope idea you continue to preach the
[52:45] holy ghost do i continue the process
[52:46] through the sentence that is the message
[52:49] hallelujah paul said you can understand
[52:52] all mysteries
[52:54] you could have faith to move mountains
[52:56] you can give
[52:57] them body to be burned
[53:13] okay
[53:17] god is good to us isn't he jerry born
[53:21] face to face and and this is why
[53:24] the bible tells us that we shall see him
[53:28] as he is the word of god according to
[53:32] first john 3.
[53:36] we're going to read the first and second
[53:40] verse
[53:46] the truth of the matter is a lot of us
[53:50] have been
[53:53] a part of a system unfair proud dance
[53:56] system and you don't want to acknowledge
[53:58] it but it's true anyway
[54:00] so many of us believe that if we believe
[54:02] brother branham is the prophet
[54:06] that guarantees that's a ticket in
[54:08] heaven
[54:10] millions believed that moses was a
[54:12] problem
[54:14] and in hell they lift up their eyes
[54:21] even though we needed that ma'am based
[54:24] on this they give us understanding of
[54:26] the day that we're living
[54:27] in god don't care about your traditions
[54:32] hallelujah who can outdo the jews
[54:38] fair much when it comes to traditions
[54:43] they're still faithful to their
[54:44] traditions
[54:46] it was their traditions that made them
[54:48] miss christianity
[54:52] and your traditions if you're not
[54:54] careful
[54:56] jesus christ
[55:01] oh my is that true even paul says
[55:06] i've got to be careful
[55:09] i become a cast away
[55:16] first john behold
[55:19] wait what manner of love the father had
[55:22] bestowed upon us
[55:25] that we should when you call the sons of
[55:27] god
[55:28] therefore the world knoweth us not in
[55:31] resolve
[55:32] because
[55:36] [Music]
[55:47] men who suffer when he shall appear lost
[55:50] he shall be like him
[55:54] as he is hallelujah hallelujah you know
[55:58] even to this day
[56:19] [Music]
[56:28] tradition and that tradition will send
[56:31] you straight to heaven he said tradition
[56:36] god don't care about where we came from
[56:40] he don't care who your
[56:54] in here who's never been born again
[57:08] all kind of jews now did they clarks on
[57:10] the street
[57:16] y'all understand what i mean by that for
[57:17] this question if you are born a jew
[57:20] you got jewish blood hallelujah
[57:23] you still ain't related not to god
[57:28] jesus christ jesus christ
[57:31] was the blood of god until his son did
[57:34] you and mary
[57:36] and joseph israel had nothing to do with
[57:38] it very yet i feel i've accepted
[57:41] so even if you're a jew see memphis it
[57:43] was a dream
[57:45] it doesn't guarantee you haven't seen
[57:48] it many jews are in hell right now
[57:52] are
[58:03] we must not allow ourselves to be
[58:20] did i finish reading that yeah oh let's
[58:23] let's read the second verse
[58:26] beloved now we the sons of god may not
[58:29] concern
[58:29] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[58:32] be
[58:33] but we know
[58:48] when jesus christ came conscious in 1963
[58:54] in the clouds
[58:59] what did he show guess you know he did
[59:02] not come
[59:03] in the form of his body in a bathroom it
[59:05] should have formed this one he came in
[59:07] the form of his headship
[59:09] he lived reduced to that form the image
[59:12] of the cloud
[59:13] the masjid was the face of jesus christ
[59:16] now
[59:21] it was the beginning of the translation
[59:25] come on smart did i left hallelujah
[59:27] people said well i'm waiting on the
[59:28] rapture
[59:29] but i'm in the rapture just sweetie why
[59:32] because god is changing me from glory to
[59:37] glory to glory
[59:39] and one of these old days this mortal
[59:42] shall put on immortality
[59:59] and the word of god in the holy of
[1:00:02] holies
[1:00:06] of transformation
[1:00:10] turned aaron's rod into a living
[1:00:54] and not being
[1:01:09] we are living in a time people are not
[1:01:12] taking this message seriously
[1:01:16] you're supposed to lay in the presence
[1:01:18] of the sun
[1:01:19] are you supposed to pray you're supposed
[1:01:21] to fast

[1:02:06] says amen
[1:02:08] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:02:10] him
[1:02:13] for we shall see him as he is he
[1:02:18] what is it he's the same yesterday today
[1:02:22] and forever
[1:02:24] word of god
[1:02:27] hallelujah and you must become the world
[1:02:30] if we avoid it
[1:02:32] todd you you know we don't know
[1:02:36] when the gentile door is going to come
[1:02:38] out
[1:02:41] you don't know but once it's shut
[1:02:44] fulfillment that means there's no more
[1:02:46] entrance specifically
[1:02:48] hello i don't understand where i have to
[1:02:51] i'm not
[1:02:52] speaking politics but let me let me say

[1:02:55] that's good even israel is shaking in
[1:02:58] her shoes

[1:04:04] battling twice yourself
[1:04:05] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[1:04:10] i
[1:04:27] and if god can't lead you like a lamb
[1:04:32] he's going to drive you like cattle
[1:04:37] i'm not saying you're not bride it's in
[1:04:39] deepak

[1:04:42] measure proof of deacon if god
[1:04:44] spewed laodicea out of his mouth it
[1:04:47] seems
[1:04:48] like he said a church that once was on
[1:04:50] fire
[1:04:51] legally involved
[1:05:06] you become lukewarm you literally become
[1:05:09] detrimental
[1:05:12] to the body of christ
[1:05:15] is that right you affect the body of
[1:05:17] christ and
[1:05:18] on judgment god will judge you

[1:05:37] and joshua says don't you take
[1:05:40] nothing of the inhabitants don't you
[1:05:43] add nothing hallelujah
[1:05:46] and what did he do he thought he could
[1:05:49] have some secret sins
[1:05:53] most people don't see what you're doing
[1:05:55] god sees what you're doing
[1:05:58] that's the anointing of this church
[1:06:01] hallelujah hey the song leader can't
[1:06:04] make you come up to level
[1:06:06] you and i are supposed to come in here

[1:08:04] space-to-face encounter

[1:20:26] he took that box and he shrunk it
[1:20:29] because he wanted more people to have it
[1:20:33] so he put it into a phone hallelujah
[1:20:36] and now your phone number for the
[1:20:38] telephone
[1:20:39] y'all don't know what i'm talking about
[1:20:46] when the first phone came out
[1:20:50] it was twice the size it did differ
[1:20:55] did you all know that let's go for this
[1:20:57] we used to have it on our shoulder right
[1:21:00] we thought we was cool cool
[1:21:06] you know flash the phone
[1:21:15] it's the truth so what the devil does
[1:21:19] he says i got to get these christians
[1:21:21] because i feel secretly i can't
[1:21:23] get them to look at what i want them to
[1:21:26] feel
[1:21:35] if you ain't got the holy ghost you
[1:21:36] shouldn't have one
[1:21:40] sentence
[1:21:44] well i'm going to give give them to my
[1:21:46] children
[1:21:48] to keep them from going out into the
[1:21:50] world
[1:21:51] and they in the world in your house on
[1:21:54] the phone
[1:22:08] if you constantly eat ice cream what's
[1:22:10] going to happen to you let's see
[1:22:11] this ice cream you're going to get that
[1:22:16] throw some cake in there too right
[1:22:18] brother i should tell you
[1:22:20] guys it's going to check i know this is
[1:22:22] simple but i'm trying to get over to you
[1:22:25] you can't say i'm in the third pool
[1:22:28] everybody like living in the second or
[1:22:29] the first
[1:22:32] it was a manifestation it was yeah
[1:22:49] beyond what they saw in pentecost
[1:22:53] this is no joke and it's really
[1:22:56] happening
[1:22:57] but it's just a small group of people
[1:23:00] a small number of people that this thing
[1:23:03] is happening to
[1:23:04] and a lot of us don't even know what's
[1:23:05] happening this is why
[1:23:08] the rapture takes place there'll be a
[1:23:10] lot of people so called in the message
[1:23:12] won't even know it's taking place
[1:23:18] in
[1:23:21] back to my thought and i'ma let you go
[1:23:26] how do you know
[1:23:30] how do you know that god is in your soul
[1:23:37] because in your soul there are no
[1:23:40] feelings
[1:23:42] there are no emotions so how are you
[1:23:45] going to know
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:00] god was behind the veil
[1:24:03] even the priesthood remember to the
[1:24:06] people
[1:24:08] they thought the ark of the covenant was
[1:24:10] behind the man
[1:24:14] but when jesus died and the veil was
[1:24:18] written from top to bottom
[1:24:21] there was no ark to see
[1:24:25] because the ark had already been taken
[1:24:27] away from israel
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:51] history tells you that when when the
[1:24:54] veil was rent
[1:24:56] there was no ark
[1:25:05] that's where it was hanging on the cross
[1:25:08] even the replica
[1:25:09] of the ark of the covenant was not
[1:25:11] behind the curtain in jerusalem
[1:25:15] but they faked it they don't uh just
[1:25:18] like the pentecostals
[1:25:19] and all of the rest of these religions
[1:25:21] they're faking it like jesus
[1:25:23] is dead hallelujah
[1:25:50] somewhere you must come to see him face
[1:25:52] to face
[1:25:55] hallelujah i i'm trying to close this
[1:25:57] thing
[1:25:58] but when rebecca mcconnell
[1:26:01] she was on she she she was on that camel
[1:26:05] amen and brother brown said that camel
[1:26:07] represented the holy ghost
[1:26:10] hallelujah hallelujah and i got a real
[1:26:14] quote i want to quote before i
[1:26:15] stop but when she
[1:26:18] saw isaac
[1:26:26] that means when she met isaac
[1:26:29] ridiculously the only face she
[1:26:31] saw on you search for his face
[1:26:36] hello hello why do you think jesus came
[1:26:39] in this last day
[1:26:42] we shall see him as he is
[1:26:46] the word and you are the body of christ
[1:26:49] which must be the word as well
[1:26:53] unadulterated unhybrid it has to be the
[1:26:56] real
[1:26:57] word all right
[1:27:00] i'm gonna close on this there's no way i
[1:27:02] can finish
[1:27:07] what is what is the shekinah glory guess
[1:27:09] girl i grew up
[1:27:13] this is what i love about balakai's a
[1:27:15] minute malachi's foreign ministry
[1:27:30] he preached but he waited on him
[1:27:35] but i thought he was inside he was
[1:27:38] insane
[1:27:40] amen but he was looking for the very
[1:27:43] person the manifestation of
[1:27:46] god himself the elohim
[1:27:49] the father call him the spirit whatever
[1:27:52] you want to call him
[1:27:54] he was waiting on that mighty angel
[1:27:57] right there were times he couldn't even
[1:27:59] remember what he said
[1:28:01] he was so yielded to the holy spirit
[1:28:04] until he
[1:28:05] had to go back to find out what he had
[1:28:07] said
[1:28:10] hallelujah he was so yielded to the holy
[1:28:13] spirit
[1:28:14] that god was able to use his mouth his
[1:28:16] mind and his spirit
[1:28:18] take a public jesus this is where god
[1:28:20] wants us to be
[1:28:21] that's the secret so yielded to his holy
[1:28:24] spirit
[1:28:24] that we're dead to ourselves
[1:28:31] brother said it like this what is this
[1:28:33] glory to god
[1:28:35] to break beyond the veil
[1:28:39] see who god is standing before you
[1:28:45] see who god is standing here before us
[1:28:48] we'll walk you to jerusalem
[1:28:50] of fire on the first he is veiled in
[1:28:53] human flesh
[1:28:53] he's so foreign but what does the
[1:28:57] kinda what did it do i guess god
[1:29:00] finished it
[1:29:03] seed the word
[1:29:07] that we're to live on in this day
[1:29:10] by these promises the kind of glory
[1:29:14] ripens like brothers that's your bread
[1:29:17] families brings it to me
[1:29:20] bread to the believer elephant
[1:29:25] the show bread ripen the show bread
[1:29:29] you must understand that the show break
[1:29:33] when it was brought in by the priest
[1:29:35] constitution
[1:29:36] was half
[1:29:50] this
[1:30:11] that's why the prophet god said it like
[1:30:13] this you cannot read this bible like a
[1:30:18] newspaper
[1:30:25] in order to get the revelation of this
[1:30:27] bible
[1:30:28] that's why you got theologians right now
[1:30:31] who still believe that
[1:30:32] god is three and not one
[1:30:39] can i finish this let's go put down this
[1:30:46] one
[1:30:48] the shoebread seed word let me let me
[1:30:50] not yet shoe bread
[1:30:53] brings it to pass that amen
[1:30:56] let me let me start back for brother by
[1:30:59] these promises
[1:31:01] the shekinah glory ripens to show bread
[1:31:06] and brings it to pass makes it bread to
[1:31:10] the believer
[1:31:12] that lay in the pages of the bible year
[1:31:16] after year the word for this age
[1:31:21] the denominations like they do
[1:31:22] nominations stumbling block
[1:31:25] to the denomination they stumble
[1:31:43] jones knox all stumbled at it
[1:31:46] dude but what it is to be done
[1:31:50] in the last days what is
[1:31:53] to reveal get get scared it means to
[1:31:56] bring forth
[1:31:57] see i'm in it what malachi fought to do
[1:32:00] to turn back the people from the
[1:32:02] stumbling block
[1:32:06] to break down the traditions
[1:32:10] and to reveal the bread with the
[1:32:11] shekinah glory
[1:32:15] watch it ripens regardless and produce
[1:32:18] just exactly what is said it will do
[1:32:21] exactly do you understand what he's
[1:32:24] saying
[1:32:25] the ripened bread the bank of malachi
[1:32:28] 4. we'll produce what is said it's going
[1:32:31] to produce
[1:32:32] but if you read it without the anointing
[1:32:35] without this kind of glory will not
[1:32:38] produce
[1:32:52] everything must be mixed with fire
[1:32:55] exactly
[1:32:56] every sacrifice had to have the fire
[1:32:59] sacrifice the bread had to have the fire
[1:33:01] everything has to have the fire
[1:33:11] hallelujah i'm almost done just this
[1:33:13] last quote
[1:33:19] watch it ripens and produced just
[1:33:22] exactly what he said it would do
[1:33:25] exactly the shoe bread for this age
[1:33:30] to the denominations a stumbling block
[1:33:33] a bunch of fanaticism fanatics
[1:33:37] but we who believe menu but now
[1:33:40] amen as revelation 10 is promised all
[1:33:43] the mysteries of god
[1:33:44] that's been hidden in the pages down
[1:33:46] through them

[1:35:45] we make salvation so difficult
[1:35:49] we make it so hard because we
[1:35:52] always want to put ourselves in the
[1:35:55] equation basically
[1:35:57] you can't do one thing
[1:36:00] but you can't ask god but you pray them
[1:36:02] on that you have not
[1:36:04] do not because you ask not and when you
[1:36:08] ask

[1:51:35] i want god to tear down every wall
[1:51:39] [Music]

[1:51:46] uh every wall satan has between us i
[1:51:50] i want god to tear it down
