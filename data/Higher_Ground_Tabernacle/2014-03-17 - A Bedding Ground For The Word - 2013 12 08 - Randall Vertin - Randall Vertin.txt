TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good to see everybody here this morning by the grace of God everybody that was able to make it safely amen I don't know if anyone else is on the road or anything but just keep everybody in prayer you know I know things get strange once snow starts falling you think people ought to be used to it in Iowa but it seems like as soon as the snow comes out people kind of go a little crazy so I just know as soon as we walked out to our car this morning we heard police sirens going off so I just pray the Lord keep everyone safe and glad that everyone was able to make it here safely but the grace of God so uh we're going to try to get we're going to get right in the word let's just turn to Exodus chapter 4 just want to preach an encouraging message for you this morning just on faith because this is something we got to have in this hour you know where're every everywhere we turn our faith is being attacked whether it be in the in the government our faith is being attacked whether it be in your own mind you know or whether it be within this own this message itself you know it's being attacked from within so we we have to strengthen you know the scripture says that David encouraged himself in the Lord we have to strengthen ourselves we have to be at a place right now where we know what we possess and we can't let because the enemy is going to continue to do what he does because he doesn't change his tactics they've been he's been doing his thing for 6,000 years just like the Lord's been doing his so we have to be at a place where we know who we are and we have to know what we have in our possession and understand that what we have the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal so let's just read this little scripture here Exodus chapter 4 we're going to start at verse one said and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken under my voice for they will say the Lord has not appeared unto thee now I have a question isn't that what people tell you all the time you try to give them this word and that's the first the Lord hasn't told you anything you know it doesn't seem like you got anything but I love what he tells him here and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod I can almost imagine him he's like he's probably Moses probably looking at it like it's a stick a rod and he says and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob hath appeared unto thee amen now let's just turn over to Mark chapter 4 as Wellen I trust everyone's in a good mood this morning amen it's the Lord's day every day is the Lord's day but this is the day one of the days we set aside to come together it ought to feel it ought to feel really good to be able to kind of take a break from the battles of the world that you're fighting out there this ought to be a place where you can as I say like you let you just let let everything out let it out just relax and enjoy the word of God so amen we're just going to read a little bit here and uh let's just start at verse 13 Mark 4:13 and he said unto them know ye not this Parable and how then will you know all Parables the swer Seth the word and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts and these are they likewise which are sown on Stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended and these are they which are sown among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and becometh unfruitful and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some 30 fold some 60 and some 100 amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus we just come to you father before your throne this morning Father we've once again gathered here before you Lord to hear your word Lord just to fellowship with you Lord Jesus we're not here just to hear the words of a man or to hear a lecture or something that'll tingle our ears Lord but we've come to fellowship with you Lord we've come to hear directly from the throne this morning Lord to hear what you would have to say to us father we're not here Lord to exalt ourselves we're not here to exalt any man any any other thing Lord we're here to exalt the name of Jesus Christ above all names Lord God you've saved us Lord you taken us from the the the Fowler snare Lord God you've taken us out of the places where it seemed like we couldn't have any place to turn but Lord your word Lord your Holy Spirit Lord your your word itself God has always been faithful to us Lord we love you and we appreciate you this morning oh God We Trust You Lord and we're looking towards you Lord the author and finisher of our faith Lord to speak to us and to encourage us this morning Lord we pray that you would just have preeminence in the service any Spirit contrary to you right now we bind it in the name of Jesus Christ we come with the authority Lord that you've given to your bride in this hour Lord to to trample upon those serpents Lord that try to infiltrate the place of God but we know our position oh God we know the authority that you've granted to us to have power over these things and we bind those in the name of Jesus Christ and we put them under our feet right now Lord come and speak to your people Lord Empower your people by the word of God this morning Lord to live overcoming and Lord holy lives Lord and we just thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated amen good to see everybody still showing up by the grace of God I know the snow is you know it's it's I I'd tell my wife my wife likes snow L sister Lindsay loves snow and I I just can't I just can't handle it she she get the first time it snowed those few weeks back she had such a big grin on her face and I was about ready to cry but you know we just thank the lord for keeping everybody safe getting here and that the Lord will keep you on your way out amen right we just want to preach a message we just want to preach preach this over at brother Cam's church and I just felt led to kind of go we you know the Lord takes it whatever Direction he will but kind of start with the same idea we want to speak on a betting ground for the word because you you yourself are a betting ground we understand by by the word that in the beginning the the very Earth was a womb and this womb in it was placed all of these seeds in the ground and you yourself are a little Earth you're a little you're a little field and the word has been sown in your heart from the foundation of the world a word went forth and was placed In Your Vessel and it's now it's either growing it could be stagnant and that's why we wanted to read this scripture on the parable of the sewer because we understand that there were four types of ground there there was a there was a Wayside where the word was tried to be swn and yet it had no place to even gain any root whatsoever it just it just kind of bounced off as if it was a piece of concrete and and and I know we've all been in those situations you try to give the word to somebody and it just seems as though it just bounces off it doesn't have any place you people laugh at you they just look at you like you're crazy they they don't want to have anything to do with this gospel that you hold in your hand then we under and we're talking things that we all probably heard before but we just trust it'll be encouraging to you because we also understand that we have the the the thorny ground we have we have a place or Stony ground where it fell but it didn't have a place to gain root and and and and we've all I believe we've seen it in this church we've seen where where you give the word to a person and they receive it and it seems like it's starting to take hold but there's something there it just can't really seem to grab a root and as soon as something comes up they're offended and they turn away how many people have we seen in this church by itself that seem to come and they seem so excited and then and they just fall away and it's such a grieving thing to your heart to see but but it shows that there was something in that could that could accept the truth of the word but there wasn't any place for it to really gain root and we see that when the storms come they just blow over we've all seen those little plants they grow up and as soon as you know it doesn't have any place and it just topples over and and the root system only went but you know maybe a couple inches into the ground and that's what we see with a lot of people that accept the word for this hour is they come so far and they receive it really quickly but that is soon as maybe their families come against them maybe the people at their old friends can't accept it they it it becomes a social gospel to them and because they don't have what they consider a support system they can't take it anymore and they fall away we've seen to here but the really ones we want to focus on this morning are the last two we want to talk about the the ground where it fell among the Thorns because here we have a people it it's a ground that was able to receive the word Not only was it able to receive the word but it was able to grow it was able to shoot forth some branches here and there and it the the scripture never says that that word was ever was ever not able to grow but it was not fruitful and that's where we see a lot of people that are believers today is they the word's growing it's trying to grow but there are things in their lives choking the very life from that word that's trying to express itself and we see that in people's lives today they they're believers they believe the word they they haven't been chased Away by persecution they haven't been chased Away by their families or their friends or whatever else of the world that's tried to attack them but the the the thing within has sprung up and it's choked out the very life they they're they're shooting roting forth branches but there's something there that won't let them bring forth the fruits of the spirit there's something there that won't let them bring forth the very Life of Christ that's it's there in the seed that the life is there because it's growing but there's something hindering it and what does he say it's the cares of the world it's the it's the deceitfulness of riches it it's this running around to and fro trying to establish Lish a place here instead of establishing your place over Yonder in heaven Hallelujah instead of setting your affections on the things that be of God we've set our affections on the things of this world we want to have a nice car we want to have a nice place to live we want to have this and we want to have that not knowing the whole time that it's sucking the very life out of that seed that God put in you these things seem very Elementary but it's the reason I believe that we aren't seeing the power of God in our churches like we ought to because the word of God is true amen I think everyone here would it would admit that I don't think anyone here is going to say that the word of God is not true we all believe that then why don't we see the power why do we not see in Acts 238 Church here I'm not here to condemn us this isn't this isn't a message being preached to make you feel bad but what it should do it needs to encourage you because you have the goods in you this isn't about whether you have it or not I believe every one of us here has it you wouldn't be here if you didn't I don't believe that you've stood the test you've seen family members maybe come and go you've seen friends or people that you loved and cared about come and go but there's something in you holding you here you're still here the rest of the Bel the signers and all these things can come and go as they please there's something in you holding you here but now we've got to take it a step further it's not enough just to be in the message it's come time for this bride to become the message she can't just believe it she has to become it every bit of it every bit of power we don't see the power like we ought to see I really believe if the power of God was in this place the way the Bible teaches it that a demon couldn't come within miles of this place you know it Marvels me because you read the scripture and you see Jesus Christ whenever a demon even came within his presence it cried out and it said what have we to do with thee get away from us that's the way but see the devil has put it in our minds that that's not for the believer in this hour but that's exactly what it's for we are to be the very Life of Christ again on this Earth it's not about see we get so stuck on the works we get so stuck on what we're doing and and these different things it's not about the works per se it's the very life when your very presence because of your relationship with Jesus Christ is so powerful that people can't help but take notice that you've been with Jesus though you may be ignorant and unlearned they take notice just like they did in the book of Acts that you had been with Jesus there's something there they can't explain it but they know it's there that's the that's the power of Christ to the believer yes but it's a nielan spirit has crept back into the church because the people and I'm not saying just here I'm talking about everywhere you see it the people have placed the burning back into the pulpit they put all the burden of the preachers they lift men up to places they ought not to be and it's not about those men the men may have nothing to do with it just like Saul didn't even have anything to do with himself becoming King but the people could not accept the leadership of the Holy Ghost for themselves they say let a man lead us and it always comes back to that but that's not what God wants he wants to lead his children individually that's not to say we don't have pastors and all these things they're put there by God but has become such a place that you can't pray for somebody unless you call the pastor first Lord because you don't have confidence in the power of God in you amen the burden is not on brother Brooks it's not on some other brother and another Pulpit somewhere it's not on me or brother Troy whoever it might be the burden it lies with all of us amen the power lies within you it's not just within the ministry because the bride as a whole has a Ministry amen everywhere you go you're a light amen it's not just your pastor that's to be a light you're the light amen it's not just the minister the song leader the Elders of the church you are a light amen doesn't matter how young you are doesn't matter how old you are doesn't matter if you've never preached a message in your life every day day you live as a message to the world around you he's made us all priests and Kings that's not to say everyone has to preach everyone has to sing but you have a Ministry every day you live amen and there is supposed to be a power of God in you that could be undeniable amen so where is it am that's the problem it's the cares of the world has choked the life out of the people of the church they're so worried we're worried about everything else but God we're worried about our family members and it seems virtuous because we we love our family which is good like they say worry is not a virtue right if you don't have enough trust in Christ to put it in his hands and leave it then how are you going to trust them to make a Rapture amen you we've heard brother Brooks preach it but it's exactly the truth if God were to T and we were to die where's your where's your trust in then there's nothing you can do to bring yourself back to life at that point it has to be a trust in the all knowing all seeing all power Supernatural power of God it can't be based on what you think you can do you have to have confidence in what he can do it these things sound simp but these are the building blocks that many times people lose because they're so busy focused on what they've done what they've been able to accomplish it's not about what you can accomplish it's about what Christ can accomplish through you amen I mean who's to say there there are people I believe that'll make a Rapture whose only Ministry was to show up for every church service on time why because there Ministry may have been something as simple as encouraging that Pastor or preacher that every time they showed up God had someon there to hear the message it could be that simple and that could be what you what fulfills the ministry God's given to you you don't know I think we get so caught up in these things wanting to be something great the Holy Ghost doesn't make you want to be great the Holy Ghost makes you want to be small the Holy Ghost humbles you amen I just listened to the message what was the Holy Ghost given for and brother brandom said he said if you if you have a desire to be great he said you better check your experience with the Holy Ghost he said because the Holy Ghost comes to make you small amen and then he exalts you in due time it and that has nothing to do with it anyway if God doesn't exalt you who cares as long as he glorifies you with him in the End Amen it shouldn't matter we're so worried about all these little things let's turn to Hosea 10 just to give you a good scripture you see we built up we built up men we've done exactly what the Catholic Church did we're we're starting to do it at least we're in the throat now remember this won't become a denomination but the spirit of it is certainly present the nickan spirit is still there it's still fighting the people of God and what does it do what does that nielan spirit always do it wants to put man at the head instead of God Hosea chapter 10 and we're going to read verses 12 and 13 this scripture really just blessed me he said so do yourselves in righteousness reap in Mercy break up your fow ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and Reign righteousness upon you said ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies because thou did trust in thy way and in the multitude of thy Mighty Men now is that not what the churches have done they trust because they have these powerful preachers that they got something they trust that because they have this person whether it be denominational with your TD Jakes and your Joel oins and all these different ones that they exalt to such a place they think because they have these people they have something but unless you have Christ you have nothing amen and that's what they've lost just because you have a great ministry doesn't mean you haven't had experience with God it doesn't mean anything it's got to be a real Holy Ghost experience with God you can't have faith in God unless you've experienced him you can't the only way that you can believe that he is is that you've experience that he is amen Hebrews says he that has he he without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is how can you believe that he is except that you've experienced that he is amen anything less than that and you're going off of here say Amen if I said I believe in God because I've seen what God's done for brother Isaac that's wonderful but that didn't do anything for me I could believe in what God's done for brother Isaac all day long and I believe that's what people have done people see different ones that God's blessed and they latch on to that as though it's them now there's nothing wrong in taking encouragement and taking strength from the things that God's doing for other people but except you have the experience yourself it does you no good it's just like I'm starving and I see Brother Rich eating a big juicy head hamburger I say bless God I'm full now I saw Brother Rich eat a big juicy hamburger it doesn't work that way except I eat it myself amen and that's what we've done we we and I'm out trying to preach against the church but we look up here and we see brother Brooks and we get excited because he gets excited I've seen it we the the the the service could be dead until brother Brooks gets up here and then all of a sudden everybody gets into it what is it what we people trying to live of another man's experience but if you look at the foolish virgins that's exactly why they were foolish virgins because in the end instead of going straight to them that sold they went to the ones that had the oil first and tried to leech off of them amen they said give us up your oil and they said we can't do it go get it where we got it from amen and that's what you see in the churches is people trying to pull off an experience that's not their own and if you do that you will die amen you can mentally even work yourself up enough to make it seem like you're doing right because it's amazing what the mind can do now we don't believe in like mind over matter in the sense that you know those aren't the things that heals you but if you really get into those things you you can have people that'll starve themselves to death and tell you they'll swear to your face face that they're full of food because they their mind can deceive them and that's what's happened is the people have gotten to a place that they've they they've got it up here so much that they've convinced themselves they've let their mind override what their heart is trying to tell them and what the word's trying to tell them you got to look in the mirror of the word and except you line up with this word you don't have it the way you ought to have it yet it's just the truth of the matter this isn't trying to knock anybody down that because what the the point is is that it's in you to do it you have the the the the potential you have all the building blocks in you all you have to do is unleash it you have to be crazy enough to believe God when everybody else says you're nuts amen just like Moses everybody thought he was crazy when he led him to the Red Sea and there was no way out but there was a way it doesn't matter youd say I don't have the Holy Ghost yet I haven't seen this in my life I haven't seen that I don't care what it looks like you got to flee like Moses what is it that you have in your hand and hold it up before God and say this is all I've got this is what you gave me but I'm holding to what I've got amen amen we could go through all the scriptures on that we can talk about shamgar when brother bandam talks about him and how he slew all those things with an ox gold nothing but a piece of brass on a stick one little Revelation is all he had with that This Land is Our Land not the Philistines land and with that little Revelation he was able to do things that seemed impossible Samson did the same thing he had the Jawbone of an ass and he slew piles upon piles of men I believe in the scripture he says heaps upon heaps he slain a thousand men with the jaw in ass it doesn't make sense when a person can stand there in the presence of God in the church and people look down on them because they may not have all the victory they think they ought to have but there's something in them holding still Hallelujah the people may mock they may laugh but all you to do is keep holding to what you got amen don't give up on God he's still here amen he's still amongst his people right now hallu the bride's going to have her Revival I don't care what you think it looks like I don't care what the devil tells you it looks like the bride will have her Revival it's coming it's got to comeall and it's here it's in you it just got to be unlocked amen and the only thing that can unlock it is Faith that's the only thing that can unlock this thing because until you believe that it's yours it won't be yours that's right we've heard the thing said a million times you know if I hold out a million dollars and ask someone to come take it that tell you shikina this million dollars is yours and she just looks at me and says no it's not I'm like no it's yours take it and she says no it's not the only thing hindering her is her faith in what I've said if she'd say Okay poof she takes it now see and the devil right now is telling your mind if it was that easy I'd have everything I need to have but the thing is is that it's it's about trying your faith this is a trying time and and really God is looking to see how long you're willing to hold on how much are you willing to go through I I I'm telling you because you have it in you amen but how much are you willing to stand when everything seems lost are you still going to stand on that word amen when everything is falling apart are you going to stand still and see the salvation of God are you going to stand amen he that endureth unto the end shall be saved amen and that's what we're doing right now is it not we're enduring with everything we got you're hold it on but just keep holding it's the same thing with Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus they held on they held on they held on they kept calling Jesus call Jesus calling Jesus and he wouldn't come I know many of you right now feel like that you've been calling Jesus calling Jesus calling Jesus and he hasn't seems like he hasn't come but all you got to do is just hold on to that word it doesn't matter what the situation looks like your Christian Life may be dead maybe it seems like your Christian walk is dead and it's so bad you put it in a tomb just like Lazarus and you buried it behind a stone cuz you're so scared it's going to stink cuz you you know you know yourself better than anybody you know the things you battle you know the struggles you have you know the things now look I'm just being straight up with you I'm not going to I'm not going to sugarcoat stuff because everybody has been in this I've been in the experience where I thought I had something whipped for years and then the devil all of a sudden comes out of left field with that thing I thought I'd whipped and all of a sudden I was struggling again with it and I got to feel like I got to whip it all over again it doesn't matter you just keep holding on to that thing you got to respond just like Mary or Martha even now even now God will do whatever you ask amen that's the way it's got to be be for a believer in this hour because the deck is stacked against you amen it's I'm sorry it's stacked against you there' be more with the children of the devil than there be with the children of God but even now he's able to raise up people of God amen amen I may look crazy that's okay but I believe God I don't care what my situation looks like I know who I believe amen amen I don't care if my hand never seems like it's going to get healed I know my God Lives amen amen sister valand you may feel like you're going down down down but you're going up amen I don't care what the devil says you stand out of the word hallelujah if you got to go to your grave whoever you are quoting that word over and over again you do it amenallah who knows if God wants you to be a testimony for the one that didn't even see your request come to pass yet you held to the head of God am how powerful a testimony is that going to be see everybody wants the testimonies on this side but think about the testimonies on that side wo think about that you've been struggling with something your whole life maybe maybe you struggle with diabetes like our brother and all of a sudden I'm not trying to speak nothing on you brother but all of a sudden you know the Devil comes along and the Lord lets him take you away for whatever it might be maybe you have a heart condition and you struggled with it your whole life and you've been praying and believing God and all of a sudden God just lets him take you away with that heart condition no less you have a massive heart attack and die at the age of like 35 but you held on through the end what kind of testimony what kind of reproach will that bring to the rest of that world when you rais up at that throne and those people standing before you claiming trying to Puff their chest in the face of God and saying we believ you and you didn't come through and then you stand up and say I believed him till death and he didn't disappoint hallelujah what kind of a Tex I'm not trying to say that's going to happen to sister valer or whoever but I'm just saying see our mind said it's so wrong amen though he slay me I will trust him it doesn't matter what this world's got I know where I'm going when it's all said and done who cares whether you see it on this side or that I'd rather it on that side anyway cuz this word ain't got nothing for me you got to be willing to trust them all the way through though no doubt those Romans that watch those Christians die at the teeth of the lions were laughing at them saying their God could not even deliver them from the mouths of the Lions no doubt maybe some of them who had a little bit of fear were casting it out with the scripture with Daniel he said he delivered me out of the mouth of the lion and they go and die it looks crazy but the death of the Saints is precious in the sight of God when a man or woman can die whether it be dying to themselves or dying in the natural and going to the other side if you could do that with a faith in God God is well pleased with you but see if that's not your mindset see that's the thing and I believe that's what it takes when you get to a point and your faith I'm not saying who what is what I don't know but I really believe that many times God is waiting for you to get to that point in your faith till he comes on the seene because we're waiting to believe we're waiting to fully trust God we're waiting for the for the for the manifestation before we fully put everything into it you know what I'm saying it's like we won't do it until we see the down payment investment you know we got to see it but if we could just have faith in God no matter what amen what's going to happen you know I take comfort in the fact that a man of God like brother brandom who who God answered his prayers all the time could come and sit there and say if I prayed for a thousand and they died I prayed for a thousand tomorrow amen why because what happens here doesn't dictate the power of His word amen it just doesn't the world tries to tell you every day that it does but it does it amen unbelief does not hinder God it can't amen and we've let we've let all these these cares of the world come and choke us out we're so worried about this and about that and about what we're going to eat and I I I may have preached this here before but it struck me when I read the scripture where Paul said having therefore food and reignment let us therefore be content he didn't even talk about having a place to live no doubt when he wrote that the Holy Spirit quickened to him how Jesus said foxes have holes and birds have nests but the son of man have no place to is he won't even talk about having a place to live all he say is having therefore food and reignment let's be content amen and you have food and rment oh you say oh I don't maybe I don't have enough to eat oh yeah you do you got the word of God you got bread that no man knows of you got clothing clothe that is righteousness that no man knows of see we're so carnal we think because we lack in the natural something's wrong and I aome thought about that because everybody talks about oh but but David said you know I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread and yet they he think then the devil say well what about Lazarus underneath the table the poor man begging the crumbs sound like he was begging his bread that's cuz you're carnal we're talking spiritual bread this natural stuff has got nothing to do with where you stand in the spiritual oh that that kind of hurt some people I think but that's the truth if you I don't care if I'm begging my bread I have me to eat that they don't know of I got I got clothing that they have no idea where it comes from that's what I've got and yet we worry about the carnal things he said he said you worry about this and that he said you compare yourselves one with another and and you just read what Paul's talking he said aren't you carnal why do we worry about these things it goes to show that our affections aren't where they ought to be amen it's a symptom because every time I listen to the messages and I hear Brother brandham give that phrase if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in you I don't know about you but that cuts to my heart every time because every time something comes to my mind it's something I haven't given up yet and I say oh God help me because if your affections are here here's where you'll stay that you're where your heart is that that's where you're going to be but if your heart is on things above amen oh it's so simple but it's really just about selling out it's see there's nothing wrong with having things you I'm not telling you to go out and give everything away and be poor just for the sake of being poor because you got to understand your motive makes a difference too if you're just doing it just to just to be because a lot of people have done that too they'll go out and do these things just to be seen just like a Pharisee say oh I don't have anything because I gave it all to God oh I'm sure you did it may looked like it but in your heart there was something just like ananas and Safa you it just becomes another one of those you did it for the appearance but your heart wasn't in it see that's where it comes down to but we're talking about we're talking about a betting ground for the word of God you are a betting ground for the word of God there is a word of God for you that he's prepared a bride that there's a bride making herself ready right now and that word's for you amen but you have to have your bedding ground your field has to be prepared to receive that seed and see we take these scripture when we read the parable of the so we we a lot of times we bring it to Salvation you know we we cut it off at the Salvation point but you got to understand that right now the word going forth right now is a seed and it's striking your field right now and the condition of your field when you receive I'm not talking about what I'm saying it's the word of God it's not about me but your condition spiritually when this word strikes that field will determine what it brings forth amen for you it may just who knows it could just be bouncing off the walls on the Wayside and the files will come pick it up it'll never do anything for some of you this message or this word going forth might bring a Deliverance in your life but you better be careful if your your heart wasn't Stony because give it a week or two and that Victory you thought you had will get taken away as soon as persecution comes now the place we're all at that thorny ground fighting those things now whether that your ground is thorny or not that's the main thing you're fighting whether your ground is that way I don't know that's between you and God but that's the age we're in we're in a thorny ground age we're in the age of cares of the world Easy Living everywhere the world is trying to tell you what you don't have and what you ought to have you got to have this car you got to have these clothes you got to have this phone this and that it's everything everywhere that's the spirit that's trying to engulf the people of God right now he's already got because like I said we've been here long enough most of us have been here long enough to know that the word is is Right amen but now he tries to get those cares of the world to come in those little foxes trying to spoil your Vine and you need to get that Holy Ghost shotgun and start blasting them out of there amen because because it's not see because the devil tried to always bring you back to square one right as soon as something happen so many times not all of us but many of us as soon as something happens in your life that doesn't agree with the word he cried to bring it back to square one you're not even saved he does oh you don't even have the Holy Ghost you ain't got this you ain't got that you ain't got this and all he's doing is trying to choke the life out of it he knows that if you could just take that sword of faith and start hacking away at those little weeds and Thorns that that thing would live because it wants to live amen it's here it's in you the word's there amen but the only thing you got to do is you got to clear out your Fields you got to make room for that that thing to live amen I hope that's okay amen see I love it because you think about Mary and Martha at the tomb of Lazarus and and and the first time Jesus came it seemed like Mary had the right thing and Martha wasn't doing the right thing but you see but it wasn't that way Martha had her moment where she was busy about the little things of the world and Jesus said you've been busy about many things but only one thing is needful and Mary's chosen the better part but then when you see the tomb of Lazarus when the rubber meets the road Martha had a little something too and see that's what the devil does he tries to come and how many of us how many of you had you been Martha in that situation and Jesus said she chose the better part you're busy about all these other things but this is the thing that's really needful how many how many people now would have just gotten desponded and say oh God the master said I'm not even doing the right thing that's what happens a lot of times in the church because the word comes forth and might tell you something and the devil's right in your ear to tell you you ain't got nothing you're useless it's garbage you're you're you're just a piece of trash but see Martha still had a little something cuz when that La when Lazarus died and the rber met the road she was there to run to Jesus and say if you had been here my my brother would not have died and how many of you have been that way you got situations in your life and Jesus doesn't seem like he comes right away and the situation just gets from worse to worse to worse everywhere you look around it's just getting worse and worse and worse and then when Jesus finally comes say Lord had you been here this mess wouldn't have happen but how many times do you follow up like Martha did but even now see a lot of times we get attitudes we we do we get attitudes because God didn't work on our schedule and now there's this huge mess most of the times that we made because we tried to stick our hands in it and fix it ourselves instead of waiting on God just like Saul if you would have just waited on Samuel to do the sacrifice and everything he needed to do he wouldn't have made the mess that he did but what do we do we put our hands in it we try to fix it ourselves we think we know what's going to happen and God comes he says why did you do that just like he said to Mary Mar he said he said I'm glad I wasn't here he said I'm glad I wasn't here so because there's a purpose behind it see it really comes down to trust these things are so simple but isn't that the problems that we Face are the simple problems see for I believe for all of us here Satan can't come to you and convince you this message isn't true you know the message is true but then what does it come down to it really becomes just trusting every day in Christ for everything every moment of every day living in such a way to where your life isn't your own anymore if if he told you to pack up everything you own and move to Hawaii or we'll make it not so pleasant move to Russia Hawaii many of you might want to go I mean who knows with the weather right now but but if you knew he told you but you're willing to do no matter what it takes to please him it's that simple but how many of us are in that spot where we could completely say we have completely trusted what God's doing in our life I believe most of us are at least a part way up that rock we're on a road but see everything has to be taken care of everything whether it be your family situations and to those I say just like Martha even now God's able to save your family God's able to give you the Holy Ghost even now God's able to heal you when it seems like everything's lost even now he's able to comfort you amen when you feel lonely when you feel like there's no one that cares there's always one that cares amen and I'm often I often get struck in my heart let's stand I'm not going to hold you any longer I want to keep it short I find lately that the Lord has just blessed me to try and keep things short that way it'll stick like they say short and sweet but you know I'm struck in my heart many times when I find myself leaning on anything that's not of God whether I mean it could be it doesn't even have to be anything sinful if you I mean it becomes sinful when you lean on that instead of God but in and of itself it's not for example you know it so listening to music can become something that could become a stumbling block because when God calls you to prayer you just go listen to some music because it soothes you it does this it could be something it seems so simple but you got to be able to hear the voice of God for yourself and you know when he's calling you I I love the way see I use brother Brooks's little quotes a lot because he says it in such a way it's so simple and I love it because it hits me at least I'm a simple guy and I think about it he said he said it don't even make sense you know something calls you to prayer and you're not sure if it's God you think the devil is going to call you to prayer you know things like that it's so simple but then we just ignore it but it always strikes my heart because I think I think about the Lord I say Lord you ought to be enough for me I I should not now this isn't against anybody here but I shouldn't need any of you you when I say it in this sense in in a carnal sense I we need each other don't get me wrong but when it comes down to your life I shouldn't need anything else but Jesus Christ amen now Jesus Christ is in you and he works through each one of you so we need each other in that sense but when I'm talking about if my and I preach this before here I if in my life I get a downtime and I'm feeling and I'm struggling or whatever and every time I get down I pick up the phone to call brother Keith I got a problem there's nothing wrong with brother Keith brother Keith's not the problem it's because I'm leaning on something else now there may be times when calling him would be the action the Lord wants me to take but if all it become it comes a habit that I need to call this brother I need to do this or I need to do that instead of seeking first the Lord Jesus something's wrong and that's what I'm here to tell us right now there is something this isn't to condemn anybody this is to make you know though that the power of God is here amen but if it's not being expressed the way each one of us know this is not all there is to it right there there's not all this this is not all there is to the Holy Ghost in This Hour this is supposed to be a bride age when this bride expresses a word so powerful that the world can't hold it so God just takes her away that's the power that's in the church right now in the bride of Christ but if it's not being expressed there's something wrong it's that simple because the word's right you say oh brother it's not going to happen till this specific time well you know if that's the case then we got to be crying out to God to get everything fixed so we're ready for that time I don't care what it is but if the power of God is not but here's the problem if God could express that kind of a Ministry through one man supposedly before the time as many people say well we just got to wait till the squeeze it the the the time's not right yet well then how could brother brandham do it answer me that qu how could brother Brandon oh he was a prophet the same God that lived in him lives in you amen I am so that that blows a lot of people's minds but it's true amen and if you if we as a whole are not living the kind of life that this word says we can live then there's something wrong and it's not with the word and it's not with the Christ in you because the Christ in you is this word it's perfect but there's something wrong whether it's a condition of the people whether it whether the time if it's not the time then God help us to know that it's not because I don't believe he'll hold that from us if if if he says it's not the time yet then at least we can have comfort in that but why is everybody struggling why is everybody crying out and not seeing what they need to see that's not my God cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same deliverer now as he was in brother brandom's day great than this shall ye de before I go under my father where's the greater that's my question where's the greater this isn't to condemn anybody this all we ought to be hungering for this stuff we got to have the power of God we have to have a Deliverance power and it's for you it's not just for brother brand it's not just for the brother Brooks it's not for me or brother Troy or whoever else it is it's for you amen you read the messages and watch how many many times brother brandham has to tell the people this brother's hands are just as good as mine he's filled with the Holy Ghost just like I am God hears his prayers just like he hears me yes brother brandham had a greater Ministry in that sense but that's because he had a purpose to fulfill the bride also has a purpose to fulfill and it's to show that the same God that lived in that man lives in you when Elisha came to the River Jordan after Elijah went up he did he held that mantle we're holding this mantle this word that our Prophet gave to us that Elijah dropped back to us when he left he left this word he may have left but the mantle that he carried this word remains amen now when elishah went up to Jordan he didn't say where be Elijah he didn't say where be the ministry of Elijah because that's what so many people are still looking for that they want Elijah to come back but I want to be like Elisha was where be the Goden of Elijah where is that power that I saw in that Prophet amen cuz he knew it was for him he was given the promise we were given the promise we've got it that's my question where be the god of Elijah he's here it's time to let him work it's time to cast aside your ideas it's time to cast aside your thoughts it's time to cast aside your desires amen because if your desires are his desires then they're satanic that's hard that sounds harsh it's the truth anything against the word is satanic anything against the desires of God so you better know where you stand and go with that we know where we stand we got the word we have that mantle it's time to use it and the other thing is it wasn't something that people didn't know about either now remember it's not going to be an open show that the world will see even if it was the world wouldn't see it because the media wouldn't do it anyway you know what I'm saying there could be Miracles going on here and there ain't no CNN MSNBC ABC CBS FOX News going to show up here and and and preach about how how amazing a miracle was done here that going to happen it'll be done in a corner to the world but that doesn't mean people aren't going to know the god of Israel is here everybody wants to think it's going to be some underground thing no no people that were around Jesus knew who he was and they knew the power was there it was just a secret from The World At Large because I tell you what the first thing that school of prophets said when Elisha came across the Jordan was surely the spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha it'll be known amongst the people that are around it at least the world that large I mean whether whether Obama knows about it or or whoever is a anchor at one of the news stations knows about it I you know that's fine by them but the people that are that are going to see it they're going to know because there's there's more to this brothers and sisters there's more to this and it's going to be unlocked by this people it's going to happen and I believe everybody here is going to experience it it's just it's just High time we got like one more scripture if I could I just going to I'll just say it for you you can look I believe it's in Proverbs 20 because this is what we got come to we got to prepare our fields to receive this word I said your condition of of your field your mind your attitude towards this word that's being preached determines what kind of crop you're going to reap from it it's not about me that's preaching or trying to get some great effect it's about what God's trying to tell you and what it can get if your field if that attitude hadn't been right how would you be saved right now but he came in a season when your field was right for the plant and that's the way it's got to be every time you got to be constantly plowing that field that's why he said break up your fow ground but right now it's a cold time it's a really chilly time in the world physical and and spiritual it's a cold time people don't want to hear this but the scripture says in Proverbs 20 it says said the sluggard will not plow his field by reason of the cold that's the way a lot of people are right now right it's so cold out there people just about giving up they don't want to deal with it because they don't want to deal with rejection they don't want to deal with how hard it is to pray through now but the Slugger and it says it says when when Harvest I'm just paraphrasing what it says when Harvest time comes he's going to have nothing to show for it and that's what you're seeing a lot of people right now it's so cold but you got to plow right through you just got to keep plowing and you if you don't faint you're going to reap a harvest and it's going to be you don't even you we can't even fa them what I tell you what he's talking about limbs being restored you know he's talking about dead being raised you know it's not about just those things that we looking for but that's part of the package right that's part of the pack I want the whole package I don't want the devil to be holding back any of my goods in layway it's all mine every promise in the book is mine amen and I want all of it amen and see the thing is I was just thinking about that in the back there I was reading about D I'll sorry to keep your standing we'll pray here just a second but I was thinking about David and how when David was crazy enough he had the audacity to believe that God would stand for Israel against Goliath his brothers got angry and you know what they thought about David they thought he was cocky they thought he was trying to make himself something and that's what happens to the people of God all of a sudden you see a person a brother or sister come in and and exclaim before the people how God's done this in their life trying like David was to Rally the people of God trying to get the people of God to see that God was with them and what do their brothers do what your brothers sisters do stand back you're just trying to you're just I know the naughtiness of your heart like like they told DAV I know the naughtiness of your heart you're just trying to stir stuff up you're just trying to make yourself some big thing no that's not it we're trying to Rally the people of God around this thing it's going to happen these things are so simple but it's the foundations that we're missing right now because these Miracles the Miracles the the the the power of God those are those are the foundational things if that some people that's hard to believe because it doesn't seem like we see any of it like we ought to but believe it or not those are the foundational things those are the things that are just kind of those are the things that ought to be just not to say in a bad way but they ought to be a common occurrence that's the foundation and then come the teaching and the maturity and the bringing forth but there the foundational things ought to be laid speaking in tongues raising the dead Healing The Sick all the the power of God dancing the spirit those things are to regular occurrences and then from there what does the word do the word comes to form and shape those things to put them in their proper places but I you know and this ain't trying to say anything bad to anybody but we got to have the foundation laid before we can go higher everybody wants the big Mysteries to bring us to a manifestation of the sons of God and we don't even have the foundation laid the way it ought to be CU if it were we'd be seeing these things because the word declares it to be so that's not a question that's the word you can take it up with acts if you want to talk about it because there ain't no real church but the acts Church bringing it back and then we're going past that but until we get there how can we move past that until we get to it people talking about being Beyond Pentecost and they haven't even gotten to Pentecost yet we got to get to it before we can go beyond it amen I'm not trying to be harsh I I feel encouraged because one thing I know is that God's true I've experienced it I've struggled went through my valleys everyone here has been through your valleys you've been I think about brother Keith and how one instant with his brother the Lord came to him and and brought him to a place of repentance with God it could take something like you just don't know what it's going to take but God's faithful I I've told you this I had to spend four years in Denver wallowing in my misery before God woke me up to some realities but you know what I wouldn't trade it for anything and I don't think Moses would trade 40 years in the wilderness and 40 years in Egypt for anything after he saw the power of God work in his life I it doesn't matter as long as you get there just hold on to it you're going to go through trials that's a promise he that liveth Godly shall suffer persecution that's a promise just don't be discouraged by it amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus oh God we just thank you gracious Heavenly Father you're so merciful to us Lord God Lord you're just so wonderful to us oh God that you place this word in our hearts Lord God we know and we trust and we believe that you are are the very God of Israel the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever you're the one that raised from the dead Lord you the one that died and rose from the dead and behold you're alive forever more and we know right now that you're alive in the midst of your people this morning Lord I pray that anything that hinders your people Lord from experiencing this fullness of the Holy Ghost you have for us that you'd give us Faith to move it out of the way Lord Lord as you told Mary and Martha Lord to roll away those stones to roll away that stone that held Lazarus I pray Lord God you'd give us the faith the strength Lord to roll away the stones of unbelief in our own lives I pray Lord Jesus that you just eliminate every opposition Lord help us to stand strong Lord help us to be like David Lord you didn't run away from that Philistine Lord but ran straight to the battle Lord having full confidence in the gospel that's been preached I pray Lord God that you'd just strengthen your people this morning Lord we haven't preached this message to be to be mean or down TR Lord but we just want to see the people of God come to a place Lord where we have such a trust in you Lord that though you slay us Lord you may lead us like Lambs to the slaughter but like a sheep dump before the shears Lord we're going to be just like you and and Lord we're going to go all the way through Lord God no matter what Lord we love you and we thank you Jesus we trust you this morning we have faith in you we're not going to let go for anything Lord by your grace we've seen the work you've done in our lives we know Lord God that the same work you've done in each one of our Lives you're going to do in our family's lives Lord you're going to do in our friends lives you're going to do in the lives of the people we come and contact with because Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever lord they're going to take notice that we've been with you Lord Jesus and I believe Lord God Lord this revival of the Bride is near it's at present it's even at hand even now working in your people I pray you'd manifest it Lord be with Lord God those that are traveling brother Brooks and his family brother Troy and his family Lord each and everyone that may be on the roads Lord if couldn't be here brother Marcus Lord we know has a long way to travel but we pray that you just keep them safe as well and keep us all safe on our way home Lord that your angels encamp about us Lord as your word States we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Amen brother Isaac comes let's start let's just sing that song just keep brother Brooks and them in prayer I believe they get back next Friday so let's just keep them in prayer as they're preaching up there I know I think brother Brook said they're even going up to the eskimos so I know that takes a lot of faith for brother Brooks cuz I know he don't like that cold so so just keep them in prayer and uh and I know we receive him by the grace of God back into our arm shortly so let's just sing that song We Got The Power we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord oh Satan ra ages we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the give me your hand oh give me your hand let's agree it together that all our end yes Lord will crumble at our feet for whatever we B on Earth shall be bound in heaven at the name of Jes yes Jesus Satan has to fle oh Lord we got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord oh though Satan rages he cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of for many years now for many years now Satan tried to stop us but the Bride of Jesus Lord Jes still li like a mighty Army will keep Maring onward winning every battle because the Lord's on our side oh we got the power in the name of Jesus we got the power In The Name Of The Lord Oh Satan raes we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the Lord amen you believe that you have the power amen you have the power amen amen now we understand understand God's put the you know he's put in the churches the pastors the prophets evangelists these things but when the rubber meets the road and you can't relying Upon A man you have the power God placed you in that's what P that's what Pentecost was all about the power the the cloven tongues didn't just set upon Peter James and John and Paul each one of them received a portion amen as we have brother Isaac come if anybody needs prayer we'll be happy to pray with you by God's grace
