TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all surely God is good to us and we're not going to prolong the time we're just going to get right into the word of God we're living in a wonderful time amen Satan is on the Rampage but that nothing he's doing what he has been ordained to do and so I I just want to say by the grace of God Amen that uh you know my back is a little bit stiff so don't think I'm sad because of that uh we've done a lot of running and riding and all of that kind of stuff and then I it started acting up a little bit but it's okay you know um I got a new one you know I mean I got a new one this is not the final this is not the end result of brother Brooks amen so it's all right you know it's it's better than uh you know uh anything else so I I appreciate it God in other words I mean it could be followers God is so good to us and as they say this will pass it's been here before let us turn to Isaiah 60 please it was wonderful seeing my uh new grandbaby and and it's amazing how uh little Israel and and Jackson looks looks a lot alike uh but by the grace of God you know it's a it's amazing how God brought him through uh he was born and appeared to be in really good health took him home and that John just kind of overtook him and they had to take take him back uh and uh through prayer of the Saints and of God Amen God brought him home and uh matter of fact they the jnas fell low and we were praying for him to you know I mean just God did some extra work there so he's eating and he's gaining weight and he's looking really good we appreciate the Lord thank you for all your prayers uh put a lot of mile on that vehicle but I told the Lord I said Lord this is all about your service amen it's all about God and he's been faithful Amen in that area Isaiah 60 beginning at uh the verse one and two we'll read one and two arise Shine for the light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee Hallelujah glory to God ain't that good amen the Bible said that the Gentiles shall come to that light and the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising amen let's read uh Isaiah 59 beginning at the 19th verse so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and His glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall be lift up a standard the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion now I want you to take notice because it says when when the enemy comes in like the flood a the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto unto them that turn from the transgression in Jacob say the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them said the Lord my spirit that is upon thee my words which I have put in their mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayeth the Lord from henceforth and forever Hallelujah if that's not good I'm locked into that scripture that's the only reason why amen that I can't turn being that I'm a seed of God that's the only reason why I cannot turn because God says so amen hallelujah let us pray Heavenly Father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord in all that you have done for us Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray father God that you would bless this s service this evening oh God we just want to let the saints of God see where they're standing in such a dark hour Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you may be seated I want you to take notice to uh that verse in 19 the 19th verse of this 5th and9th chapter so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West all right so you got to understand he's not working with the East he's working with the West right and His glory from the rising of the Sun as brother bandam said amen once the gospel came all the way to the West it went back Amen to the east so he's now working with the West because it is a time when the enemy shall come in like a flood see so you've got to recognize that uh America how can I say it it's almost like the the head of the world when it comes to influences uh whether be by Hollywood television whatever Church everybody all over the world want to P pattern themselves like America uh reason why the message have had so many doctrines spread throughout the world is because of the influence of American preachers and they are people people all over the world look at American preachers as if they know what they're talking about because you see they came from the land that God sent the prophet to and understand amen we speak the language of the Prophet so you got to realize amen that these influences Satan knows exactly what he's doing now I have been dealing with amen the power of lighting we preach the same message at brother uh Ray Ericson God had me to minister there on Sunday Sunday morning morning it was uh God did a mighty work but my point is I want to bring out some things because God really uh gave us some more Enlightenment on the word of God turn with me by the grace of God to Genesis and I'm just going to take my time here amen you love the Lord I want you to realize amen that God did not make a mistake Amen in Genesis and nowhere else did he make a mistake but I I I want you to realize amen that God is doing some mighty things and he wants you to recognize your day and his message am a lot of people have been falling away and oh it's not like God said oops I didn't know this was going to happen if you read or listen to the message three kinds of Believers brother bream tells us exactly what was going to happen in our day told us of what spirit that would be that will be working on our Brothers and Sisters in Christ supposedly in Christ he talks about the spirit of Judas Hallelujah come on I'm going to talk about it tonight so you might as well and it's all about you it's all about you I want to show you that in Genesis the first chapter please and God said the third verse let there be light and that's we said when he said let there be light it just didn't stop there the Bible said and there was light see now the focus is on the light not what he spoke but the result of his speaking hello if God said there shall be a bride it will not come back void brother Bon preached that message even on I know a man that could turn on the light he talks about how dark it is and how it's going to be let me tell you like this without the Holy Ghost you will not make it it'll be the grace of God that you fall under the realm of the foolish virgin hello because without the Holy Ghost brother bradam said you either receive the mark of God or the mark of the beast and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness I want you to understand understand this now because God has always divided and you've heard me say this before and I'm going to say it again in the beginning before there was any other thoughts outside of God's thought there was only God's thoughts it was God thoughts that the Angels the sharap and the cherubims and all the creatures of Heaven thought and obeyed am until Lucifer came with his thoughts and when Lucifer came with his thoughts his thoughts were perverted now you though his thoughts were perverted he accomplished it is that right brother bam said in God of this evil age that that Lucifer literally accomplished his purpose in which he purposed and that he would rule A Reign Over the stars of God he said this is his age right here where Lucifer or Satan is God of this evil age we're not talking about the bride age now we're talking about this age that is now in darkness is that all right the Bible says amen that in the in the fourth verse and God saw the light that it was good and he divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and he called the uh Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning was the first day see God showed amen that listen when he separated the darkness from the night he call it day he call it night and then he throws in why did he separates the the uh uh uh the the light and the Darkness and then he throws in the evening and the morning was the first day I'm going say it again the evening and the morning was the first day after he separated the darkness from the light Hallelujah so you so aware did that place be in the Bible tells us that we are children of of the day and not of the night now we're living in a gross Darkness I read to you that Isaiah said arise and shine for your the light has come upon thee right in other words in this gross Dark Age there's only one light that's really being seen and that's a supernatural light in a supernatural people everything else is dark but I I'm just going to preach it cuz I want you to realize a man that what we're seeing now is that if this age and brother brandom did it we didn't even realize when he took the seventh Church ages that was completely darked out and then he put a sliver of light there he separated the darkness from the light it wasn't him but God inspired him to do it you heard me say it like this when the prophet of God was on the scene there shall be light in the evening time come on there's no such thing in the evening time the sun is going down so the light in which God was talking about was a supernatural light there shall be a supernatural light in the evening time the prophet of God comes along he speaking this message he's showing us about organization he's showing us about denomination he's showing us amen there three kinds of Believers we would have never known that we thought Christians were Christians you either was a Christian or a hypocrite Hallelujah but he said there's three kinds of Believers those who just going to come to church and live ungodly those who pretend Amen to make believer he said that's the worst of them all because the make believer is always trying to find fault now we find out by the grace of God he comes and now he's telling us it's 3 Minutes to Midnight scientists are saying it's 3 Minutes to Midnight now why is he bring to us why because he's trying to tell us that the evening time is gone and God is moving on Hallelujah now he comes along and he preached a message is the rising of the sun right it is a rising of the Sun how can he preach a message haing the rising of the sun he said there's a star out there his ministry is now changing because now is no longer evening it is night time and it's about the breaking of a day woo Hallelujah now he tells us amen by the grace of God is the rising of the sun he tells us amen at this point in time is darkest before Dawn is that all right Watchman you heard me say what is the night if I could scream it out to everybody I would tell you right now whatever you can do get on your knees and say God separate me from all Darkness Hallelujah glory to God why there's coming a Breaking of a day you think it's dark now but I'm going tell you the Bible said that when he then when God created the sun he created the Sun and that sun began to shine his light why because there was seeds under the mon and the mar there were seeds trapped in the darkness or underneath the darkness that God had to shine light upon the Bible said that this sun dried up the waters woo and you got to recognize that water represents people and what's happening now the people are dried up but the seeds of God are receiving the sunlight it had to be separated the darkness had to be moved away so that the seed could be seen oh come on somebody and that's what we see happening in the message right now people let me tell you something well that brother walked With God all these years that sister walked With God all these years how long was Lucifer in church before he fell away and let me say it like this a tree of the forest don't easily fall until it's been dead a long time hello now I'm going tell you like this you can reason with yourself or let the devil because I'mma tell you what's happening right now and I'm going to have to jump because I feel a spirit let me tell you something it's like God revealed it to me and I believe it was God he said listen the spirit of Piper's wife is still moving amen he said Joseph received his Covenant before he got to Egypt amen hallelujah and Egypt was nothing but a a a denomination or organized Church Hallelujah but he received his Covenant but while he was there PA ofa's wife was there ordained to try Joseph to take away his virtue oh come on somebody and I tell you what if you don't run from these people who saying they denying this message you will be because you don't understand this is a spirit amen but it is the Spirit of delusion it is a spirit of Darkness it is a spirit that has been ordained to identify the false seed yes I don't care how long they've been there who they've been I've had five to six brothers who've been preachers and pastors who now denying this message but let me tell you something it ain't in me to do it I can't come like like like like the darkness can't comprehend light this light can't comprehend that Darkness I don't understand that and the only way that you can do that is that you haven't had a personal experience amen you lack the Holy Ghost how brother bam said he's a spirit of Judas and spirit the spirit of Judas waited there he didn't even leave when the 70 left he waited there to find fault in the word come on somebody and that Spirit of Judas is right now how can you say Amen the prophet made mistakes here mist listen without the Holy Ghost you can't understand it anyhow is that all right hello is that the truth the Bible said that that the carnal mind which is the devil's mind look it up brother BR said the carnal mind is the thoughts of Satan turn with me to Second Thessalonians now we've heard the scripture read preached so many times amen but let's go there now you love the Lord listen I don't have it in me I don't even know what they're doing how they can do what they do I mean it's just far this thing from my mind at a time like this when all the prophecies are being fulfilled right in your eyes the World Council of churches what you go was he wrong there was he wrong with with these denominational going back into the no was he wrong there was he wrong with the women wearing fig leaves was he wrong about the cause and all these things I it wasn't him that's why it was the god in him what God is giving to you bride of Jesus Christ is more grace he's giv you rapturing Grace rapturing Grace this thing is making me stronger now than ever before I believe it's more now than I ever I hurt for those who are not ordained for it but Judas couldn't be no more than Judas Esau couldn't be no more than Esau y'all hear what I'm saying and you ought to be thanking God if you got something in your heart that I can never turn you better recognize what that is that is the grace of God I told a brother uh brother Ben theod he was he's coming sun to minister for us Sunday I said you know what the thing about it I said you know what even if God chooses to leave me behind I know for certain even Under Pressure I could never ha I could never give it up why because I know it's true nobody educated me into this the same holy ghost that changed my life is the same holy ghost that revealed this thing to me that is true second Thessalonians everybody uh a brother from Arizona called me today and said he told the people on his website well the people who left never had the Holy Ghost tell me they've been in the mess ain't never been in the message you can't be in the message and you disagreeing with it you following something like brother bam said I got some good quotes here folks I hope I can get to them but he talks about it he said he said they just they just uh I I read it just a little while I'll read it but anyway let's let's second Thessalonians 2 now I want to encourage you because the seed this light listen nothing could be made manifest to the light and the Darkness was separated see all up to this point in time it was a mixed multitude and we couldn't tell it but now God is saying let there be light see I didn't know this when God gave me this message I didn't know what other people were preaching but God spoke into my heart let there be light I said okay Lord that's where we'll go and from that point on he showed me the power of light he showed me by the grace of God Amen what this light is all all about you know what I've been singing that song there shall be light in the evening time and never saw the Supernatural part of it until God told me let there be light like evening time is going down but at that time it was going down for the world But Rising for the believer Hallelujah glory to God yes part of his wife as I uh I as I say Amen she tried to get get uh Joseph catch him off guard wooing him and that's what they doing they trying to woo you with reasoning but Joseph say see I know who I serve come on somebody and I know that he wouldn't approve of this come on I'm not going to flirt with a denomination or organization or system you know what really and and I'mma and I'mma call his name because he's made it public but I you know when it come to Jeff he's not the only one he's made it clear that there's other ministering Brothers Who's agreeing with what he's agreeing with and if that be the truth so what what if they renowned men what if they're famous men what is that going to do to your faith absolutely not it'll not move me one bit Paul said none of these things move me what is going to move me for Hallelujah and you say what do you mean brother Brooks now you can see why the influence of these dead churches because let me tell you something if the leader was dead the people are too if they're swallowing his teachings come on y'all hear what I'm saying if they're swallowing his teachings you know what they need a real Revival don't don't let me tell you something I wish I could remember the name of that message brother Brandon preaches there in Lima right and he talks about these old trees and how these old trees used to flourish one time but they got caught by fire and the fire destroyed them and he said he he didn't know why God had him there he said those trees was making some of the most awfulest mournful sound woo he said and then he realized amen he looked down right underneath there there was a brush there under the brush there was these little Twigs these little new grow amen I told Brother Craig I said That's you that's prophecy right there I said God going to bring getting ready to bring a Revival right here in this city while these other trees fall dead amen God going to bring watch this thing the super natural getting ready to increase among the bride you watch it why because this this thing that's happening to her is making her more certain of who she is it ain't here to destroy the bride it's to identify her say you're one of them arise and shine get up from the dust Zion Shake yourself from the dust Hallelujah and arise see that's what's happening there's a Breaking of a day there's a Breaking of a day and let me let me move on listen Amen in testimony 1962 he said they were predestinated to disbelieve the word you believe that Judah said so men of old Jews excuse me said so men of old for ordained to this condemnation to rise up in the last days to disbelieve God's word can't get it no clearer than that he's not talking about denomination and organization he said to rise up see they were laying dment but they got to rise up to disbelieve God's word hallelujah come on somebody it ain't going to be effective if you you're the janitor you got to be somebody in position amen how many knows that the scripture sure for ordained of God to be unbelievers what a pitiful shape unbelievers can't help it no more than Esau could help being Esau or Pharaoh being Pharaoh what a pitiful condition and if you are a Believer tonight in the word of God how blessed your eyes are to live in this day to see the glory of God how is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit throughout out the world you are blessed because that's the love of God in your heart keeping you from disbelieving huh I told somebody the other day I'd rather backslide and believe still than to deny it that's Hebrews 6 you are totally lost totally there is no repentance there is no sacrifice so you better know what you're doing I didn't say that the Bible said it the brother said that when he put that on the internet people got mad at him I said mad at him for what he didn't do it he didn't say it God said it and this is the only age you can truly blaspheme the Holy Ghost oh help us Lord listen let me let me let me find this one quote I want to bring to you by the grace of God H he can't take the word cannot be taken out of our mouths he put it there it's in the sea glory to God is in the sea what I said to somebody I said watch this thing you don't give up something for nothing Judas traded 30 pieces of gold these men are not giving up something for nothing watch the outcome of what they receive some church some something they giving up to get it ain't just for nothing people watch it you watch that thing that Judah Spirit thought he was gaining when he was losing but I'm going to tell you something one of the worst things that's going to happen to them their eyes will be open just like Judah saw what he had done at the last moment can you imagine the torment that they're going to receive when they realize they betrayed the Lord Jesus H Oh Glory to God remember brother Brandon preached a message he preached it and he said the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ is that right if there's a second crucifixion of the Lord there's got to be a second Judas like I told the church I said there's got to be those even Among Us amen who's going to betray us and say well I know you you among that group amen listen what brother Bram says listen it and I know brother brandham is not God but I almost make me want to go in some of these folks face and say brother let them know I'm not ashamed of the go of God's Prophet hallelujah amen I I I don't say his name amen not because I'm ashamed of it I just want to put the Evas on the name of the Lord Jesus but I'm not ashamed of it I'm not ashamed to be identified with this message like I tell people if you're going to take it away from me give me something better show me anything out there better all you see is PE preachers who have become P pimps right you got to know that the Bible said according to Proverbs they the adulterous women sitting on every corner and if they're on the corner they got to have a pimp behind them you look at this thing and you this thing is a glorious age they they're dividing this thing now now maybe we could have a real Holy Ghost Revival cuz all they doing is they taking away all those people who denied the Holy Ghost well you grow into yeah you got to be born into it you might grow after you born but you got to be born first acts 238 babies is that what brother said those crying acts 238 screaming children he said the word don't know how to bring for no other kind thank God for a prop is the rising of the sun now I want you to see this he says now the Sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness and you got to hear his way of sining it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the darkness dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon on the water and said let there be light God had a re Hallelujah had a reason to do that God had a reason he's throwing something out to the bride God had a reason to in other words there's a spiritual application behind this God had a reason to do that for down beneath the waters there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have the sunlight to make it live now what are you saying I'm saying like this creepers there's a lot of wounded people now in these churches because of these creepers that have wrapped their Vines around them it hasn't changed that they're true corn or true wheat but you know how a creeper does when you take away that that uh that vine or whatever it leaves his imprint in that in that in that particular uh uh corn or wheat Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying now you got to realize am man there's a lot of hurting people and just like I told the church up there in bluon I'm not preaching against people you know the people have already marked themselves but my point is Spirits if you don't run from this Piper's wife Spirit it ain't nothing but a Jezebel spirit cuz all of them that's leaving are cutting their hair wearing pants and doing all the things that they've been wanting to do for years now how know God how how on Earth can a person you see what it was there was never a change come on I I wish I could tell I can tell y'all some personal thing but I'm not I I just want you because I it ain't the individual I'm working with I'm working with right now just like I told the church in Lima I used to preach this all the time I said when the squeeze come on you going to find out who the true Ministers of God are cuz they're the only ones that going to be able to stand that's true you said well that sounds cold no no no no it ain't no colder than what Jesus said Jesus said amen after the 70 years has left he said yeah he said and one of you are a devil and he knew exactly who he was talking to was he cold when he said that you better recognize amen there's a lot of devils around here anybody who refus to bring the people to Christ or try to get them to Christ they're not preaching the right message I don't care who they are I don't care if they got that doctor's Divinity and that's been the deception of the whole message people because they feel like the more intellect you have and the more proper the way you can say your words amen come on that's just opposite of way God thought God thought it was best to send a seventh grade Ed educ educated man to his bride if he wanted to send a theologians he could have G gotten a few of them and he tells us brother bam tells us it's the teaching that kills the people yet the message people love all of that they want all the Deep Revelations and where has it gotten them now that fussing and fighting just like the people did didn't didn't Jesus said you know why because Inter uals don't know how to take the word of God and bring it in season they just get it and go hello but even a prophet of God who's feel with the Holy Spirit he knew how to bring it in season meat in due season meat out of season will make you sick and that's what happened to this bride people around it at the first light ever listen he said and the first light was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light see that's why people are well how can he say let there be light here and then he said let there be light here because he was talking about two different types of light Hallelujah he's talking about this light he's talking about the light that was so bright they said it was brighter than the Noonday Sun that was Jesus Christ himself he said I am the light of the world Paul saw it he said it was brighter than the Noonday Sun that's the light he talking about the light who created the light is that right amen and let there be light and there was light and uh that turned Darkness into light the light turned Darkness into light that's why the Bible talk about your heart being dark when light strikes your heart that's darken it turns it into light is that right it shows the power of light Darkness and Light can't remain in this in one room at the same time it can't happen not like this if the room is real big maybe down the hallway but not in the power of the light not in the reach of the light wherever the light is it transformed the darkness amen then the spirit of God as it moved and this is what I was trying to tell people I said you know what people think sometime I'm too easy and sometime people don't understand listen what he says he says and the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth see that's what has happened to the message what they did they put everything under a law and now the law has killed them they couldn't do it you got to do this you got to do this and if you don't do this you're going to hell that is not the way the prophet of God brought it What attracted us to him was his compassion in his love for so oh he did he brought it straight but the spirit that he brought it in was because he cared that's why you can't repeat everything he said people said well what do you mean you can't call nobody Miss dog meat unless your love the love of God is in your heart prompting you to do that you do that God going to judge you if that person is offended y'all hear what I'm saying there was a spirit behind those words they were just not words to condemn the prophet of God knew exactly what to say when to say it to get to the hearts of somebody but the condemn them was to saved them but we I've heard people say that in in condemnation they forgot where they were and the great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across it raised and dried up the waters from the earth and made what an atmosphere and for this first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth not by seeds by a seed that was a great hour so what he did see what you we must recognize is this a seed though it be in all of us it's still a seed it is only one seed which is God's seed and you have been ordained to bring joy and life to the Earth the whole creation groans for the manifestations of the sons of God this is a great hour amen denominations they do they going to do what they doing but right now we're at the breaking of the day why you say that I said because when the prophet of God said and preach that message it's the rising of the sun he was saying it is not far now God the Rapture is about to take place that that's what he's saying and and people are they don't see it see and and the reason why is because if you're a child of the night you can't see what we're seeing if you're in darkness the world you love if you in light it's Heaven that you love the first time the sun rose of Genesis it was to bring a message that there will be life upon the Earth mortal life is that right he said but this time when the sun rose there was a dual Sunrise another sun rising is not the only Su in Rising it was a s o n had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promised seed by for knowledge he had seen laying upon the Earth you hear what I'm saying so he take Genesis and he takes our time and he puts it in the same position of being Ved with without form without shape but it was the seed that was laying there and he had to say let there be light and that's what he's doing the SE a in denomination they're in the message they're in this field so when the light came and the light is come don't you see what oh I wish you could see what I'm seeing this light amen has struck my soul and is doing a greater move in my life now than it ever had been before What's Happening Now what light I know who I am I know I'm a seed of God because I know I can't do what they doing it ain't in me I'm not looking for ways out I'm so enjoying this I I'm not looking for nowhere I don't know nothing else don't want there nothing else oh he said no more than the boty life uh back there at the beginning without the Su in to bring it to life no B the day when the Son of God is upon the Earth what is this rising in order to rise you got to be down somewhere rise me come on up Hallelujah and right now this move that's I told a brother over there I said don't you know what this thing is doing Satan is he just ain't as smart as he think he is I said but don't you see what this thing is doing I said said it's literally uniting the bride by the word regardless to her Doctrine she's now standing it's right for the first time in history since the prophet of God has gone off the scene there's a people who made different in their doctrines but they're saying I know it's right come on somebody oh this exciting me because the next move is the rein filling of the Holy Ghost gather them Lord God gather them bring them all in the upper room let them get on one Accord Hallelujah and when they get on one Accord the power of God lifts up a standard when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard I'm telling you now I'm preaching something I ain't even thought about right now I know it's God call it prophecy whatever you want to call it if God is speaking tonight that's what we got to look forward to cuz brother bradam in many places said there come another infilling of the Holy Ghost that are pack us with rapturing faith and take us out of here hallelujah but you see if we must meet the same criteria and that is being on one Accord God is doing it God is doing it God is doing it m Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah no more as I said amen as you in to bring life no more than today when the Son of God is upon the Earth it takes the s o n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he has chosen them of himself before the foundation chosen can't you see oh Lord if I could like to said my mind he's holding it together right now cuz it just want to go wild you know cuz he's saying I'm TR don't you hear it do you hear him calling you chosen that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world I better understand the seals now Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Hallelujah glory to God it would have it also raised to life listen he said listen in the Easter morning then in the dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are not the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that because his son of God raised it would have also raised to life every son that was for ordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious Sunrise that was then it was at the beginning at that at time when it first dawned see he said when he got up you got up I don't understand it but he got up I got up he's risen I'm risen Hallelujah that's why you can't deny it you know it already happened you were there oh my God in the message Shalom he says now good morning means peace darkness is gathering what's is gathering for to show the light come on somebody Isaiah 61 says Rise and Shine for the light has come to you that's the reason I can say shalom the light has come to you what light people right now the light has come to you I don't know how to say it oh I just know what my experiences are be what's happening in me right now before now when I've heard this thing over a year or so ago nonsense but I didn't catch it I didn't catch it I didn't see it like I see it now he's saying peace to you peace to me you maybe you can't identify it like that but I'm saying peace to me W to the elect woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the world called out and ordained to that the rest of them will never see it can you see it can you see it he said the rest of them will never see it they'll never know nothing about it the Bible says so and Jesus said no man would come to me except the father draws him first and all the father has given me will come wo glory to God he said then stood Judas light shining up here but back in his heart was dark seed shining they looking at him and it no nobody suspected him but he said on the inside was dark seed and when the show down come to the darkness show when The Showdown came the darkness showed here was a little old woman all black out up here talking about the woman at the well from uh but down here was a predestinated seed and when the light come it scatter the darkness away and showed forth see what I'm saying we know Messiah has come and when he does he will show us these things Jesus said I am he but Judah J doubted it he said Judas doubted it yet supposed to be walking in the light see yet supposed to be walking in the light but he doubted it Hallelujah see the light up here doesn't matter it's the light down here that counts see when it's in your heart you can't give it up Hallelujah in your head if Satan persuaded if you let somebody persuade you into the message you can let somebody persuade you out it's a light down here that counts the light up here will will walk in fellowship and everything else but when the real power of God hallelujah comes in it it can't come back to the Dead Sea it'll reflect off in a denomination but when it's back down here a genuine predestinated seed when that light comes down here shows all the darkness of away from you and put you in fellowship with Christ huh he was the one who gave us he Li uh gave you life before the foundation of the world he keeps going back there otherwise you'll never see it what God Said now to you predestinated seed Shalom amen God peace rest upon you because we've near the end now he's saying we need near the are you catching this thing this thing that's happening in the message is one sure sign we're near the end wo well right down to the end we're going to talk about the group for a while Shalom God's light has come the world light is Vindicated again so that you can see the manifestation of the promise of God for this day search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they testify of the day that we're living in what is this light of the day what did the bible promises for this day see what and see what have it is see what it is amen how it is amen so he says listen you and I must recognize that this thing has come brother he's going off the scene but he says now in the rising of the sun there's got to be a Breaking of the day look what he says now oh oh oh come on somebody I'm enjoying this and I I hope you are he said in the beginning of the the end of the Gentile uh Gentile disiz he said uh look at he says um uh I love I love to get up early don't you like to rise early I remember when when Brethren and I were in the mountain real early in the morning around 4:00 we rised up looked hanging back there and there was a the morning star that's what I'm working with it gets real dark just before the break of day we see the darkness Gathering now what is it it's light pressing against the darkness one has to give away all the creeping things that's been running through the night when that sun comes up they take to shelter and when the light shine night and darkness night and light cannot exist in the same building is either day not dark or is light and light is so much more powerful than Darkness so Christ is so much more powerful than all the evil in the world now remember he says now we're taught by scientists as light began to come into condence and darkness the darkness and the Darkness gather all his hostes together to fight against the light but the light prevails and come on Hallelujah the light prevails what light the light on the inside of you it shall Prevail I Don't Care What doctrine what accusation what they try and listen they will go to the council oners amen Judas went to the Council of churches you better understand what we working with oh he was my friend he's my buddy I'm going tell you something he's a devil whoever he is that turned his back on this message and deny it brother bam said he becomes your enemy you don't partake with that kind of person you can't sit at the same table with that man anymore or woman whoever it may be they become your enemy and if the world become your your friend you become an enemy of God while you going to sit at the table with them then they come to to change you is that right you say well God yes God didn't like what Lucifer did he kicked him out separated Lucifer and all of his gain from the light of Heaven come down to earth when Adam and Eve Sinn they walked in Darkness God separated them from his light amen is that right oh you got to recognize God always do that amen God will separate the children of God the Bible said when the midnight came on Egypt there was light and gohost Hallelujah God will always separate is that right amen and you got to realize by the grace of God can't you see what this church world has done to the Bible it is made it of nonone effect but but there's a bride who may not have ever seen a miracle know that it's true know that it's right and God said I'mma prove it why because right now when the enemy comes in like a flood I lift up a standard is that right oh come on somebody when Satan lift up a came in like a flood on on Moses what did God go God proved to the world who had the true Living God is that right absolutely right now I'm coming to something in just a moment the tells us amen except the Lord build a house the laborers labor in vain this ain't a this ain't a a situation where you can practice living holy you got to have the Holy Ghost and I don't care what nobody say brother said I fear that the people the preachers have not been getting the people of Christ now if y'all recognize I'm going to tell you this like this people of God I can I don't know whether you got it but God knows and you know but don't you let this thing this hour pass you bow with the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you're dead twice dead hello somebody oh my God don't you understand amen that's why the devil tried to distract us keep us busy keep us tired keep us everything he don't want us to focus on the thing that's going to get us out of here he don't care about you coming to church and being religious and all that he don't care about that he's all just interested in your soul come on somebody and somewhere somehow and somewhere soon somehow you better make sure you got it and how you know you going to get you got it your change your desire for this world has to change must change will change and what happened the Bible is right and you're wrong I was telling you this and I said this before don't you know Jacob had to wrestle with that angel all night listen go to your computer and find out what brother BR talks about all night prayer and rebuking the people because they don't do it no more uh what is it people don't realize a there's power in prayer especially at night because first of all it's going to be difficult to pray at night because that's when all the demons out but understand there's a Breaking of the day Hallelujah and is at that breaking of the day that God rewards you amen is that right the Bible said Jacob was a true seed of God he had the promises of his daddy and everything else but he didn't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and Jacob knew he saw Esau coming he said I can't face Esau by myself Lord and you can't face this world of Council of churches by yourself the Bible said according to Daniel there'll be a time that's never been before you and I can't imagine the hell that's going to be on this Earth forgive me for sin it that way but that's exactly the way it is hallelujah you said I'm having a rough time this is light feather work compared to what these demons got coming our way the way they can torture men right now has never been even heard of Hallelujah did y'all know that these old Devils even know how to put things inside you to make them eat you from inside out people of God we better know what we we we we're working with maybe it ain't an urgency now but it will be and I trust TR by the grace of God because I'm going to tell you something the door of the Gentile is about over that's how close we are to this thing because if God let me put it this way if it's Darkness you know how it is on the world side if it's Darkness on this side it must be light on the other side it can't be light on both sides of the world Hallelujah come on somebody and if it's midnight and getting ready to break day don't you see what I'm saying that's why those Blood Moons had to come those Blood Moons were showing a change in dispensation I don't know whe that's the correct word but a change in time God turning now he's turning and he's literally focusing himself on these seeds because God going to raise up prophets over there help us Lord don't worry shalom shalom peace be to the bride you don't worry amen God going to take care of that but you got to have your mind focused see let me read this and I'm I'm going let you go now Jesus said he came work and you heard me say this the last minute he said he said I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work is that right now realize brother B told us he said the night is coming it's going to be so bad you we as preachers can't even preach pray for people L we'll be shot killed thrown in prison that's what he's saying do God's Will and work now while it's still time and the law is not against you but when that thing crushed amen you can't do nothing L you be killed orless you become a whatever but he's saying it won't you can't do nothing when it's dark as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world that's what he says now now I'm going to read something here it called it comes from countdown brother B talks about the horse and buggy the automobile airplane and the astronaut and he goes on he say father he said I pray father that they realize it isn't trying to down uh condemn uh H uh them what they had is only trying to give them what I have is is is trying to give them more uh rapturing Grace for the hour will come when we will have to have rapturing power and not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ will be so real in their bodies till he'll change it by his great death and what he purchased is he real in your body yet he will be so real it's like having another head you know you got a head you know you got two hands it's real right you can feel it and you can see it you can have no things that's what he's saying Christ will be so real oh is God in Me you he'll be so real into their bodies till he'll change it by his great death and what he purchased may they may they take this uh this today that token I spoke of last night hold it before them and walk into the astronaut granted father where Visions uh Power and the world Beyond known and oh God where all the great mysteries of God is in unfolded in the Seven Seals and made known uh to man he said granted father in the message Jehovah jar he says now it's not some uh man here is the Messiah it's the holy spirit is the Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it is now just working in the flesh getting the body ready for the rapturing grace see the Holy Ghost is the only thing that could be working in you to get you ready for the Rapture and and yet we just say oh well but I tell you one thing folks all I can say is this they're coming a time when we wish we had been more diligent he says listen in and and I'm going close in he the beginning and ending of the Gentiles he said what is it I've walked out and looked at the great morning star as she began to move Yonder what does the morning star say say the Morning Star is only reflecting the screem light of the sun coming is that night is that right the Morning Star the reason is so bright you know why it is the Sun so much closer to it it's a pressing on and a moving star hailing the coming of the sun all right you moving stars it's time to go hailing his coming shine morning Stars rise early it says that the sun will soon be here when we look and see the Morning Star just a glistening in the sky it means that the sun will shine pretty soon and when we see the morning stars of God rising and I put there myself take your position and shine into the glory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ shows that the Supreme one is pressing on the lights are gathering but the morning Stars hollering holding on isn't long to Daylight hold on is not long to Daylight just keep holding on as sister Murphy and them used to sing just keep holding on daylight soon coming hold on today the morning stars are shining to the world now lighting up the world just before the great darkness and the great th thunderboat from Heaven the coming of the Lord so he likened the coming of the Lord as a great thunderboat I'm telling you this is the season we're living in you don't have to believe me but I'm just telling you that's what's happening he's dividing the light from the darkness Leo deia been in darkness for a long time but you see the message had to go through her seven Church ages and my point is this right now amen you got to realize amen you're going to either be married to Christ or married to the devil there's no in between somebody's going to Lord over you whether you like it or not and you have a choice you know what's in you would choose the right thing if it's a God if it's God and like I said you know with all my heart I know we all come short but I'm praying because I you know what I'm saying you know I I I I done been places many times you know well if I fast this many days if I do this if I do this you know like I'm trying to uh make it happen you know but what you know what happens when you the Bible teaches us you don't do that you get on your knees you talk to the man who can make the change if he tells you to fast you don't have to worry about it you'll never get hungry there'll be no temptation till God is done with you y'all hear what I'm saying but we're living in a time people and right now I'm telling you Satan has a hole somewhere on a lot of us and you got to say God help me delivered me because I'm going tell you something people of God is nothing you know what I'm saying you think about it brother bam talk about a foot race in hell he talk about the preachers who deceive the people and when they he said it'll be a foot race in Hell they'll be running him trying to catch him saying why did you deceive me think about God knows I mean I have enough trouble here I don't want to be get in Hell running from y'all y'all understand when no I'm running from nobody that's a nightmare in itself so my point is this people of God I I all I know is the only thing gonna get you out of here is the Holy Ghost amen it ain't your education it ain't how much you know or think you know it's being sealed with the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that's going to get you out of here I don't care let me tell you like that's just the bottom line and if you got the Holy Ghost you know what you're doing you feed it Lord I want to I want all these virtues I want them all everyone that pet on name I want it all I want to be capped with Divine love I want to be have want the Divine love on display cuz that's the token life for our day Divine love you love the Lord don't be discouraged uh as much as possible you know these things got to happen and let me tell you something the Bible said that let they come a great Falling Away we thought the blood moons was just affecting the Catholic church and the denominational church and we didn't see it happening here now we see now you you you you know our battle is with our Brethren now right come on Jacob and Esau hallelujah amen you got to recognize that majority of those people are taking the mark of the beast right now Methodist churches organizations and all already went back to the Catholic church and people still remaining Methodist lutherans have done the same thing now the Pentecostal is doing it hello what's going to happen to you if you're not in the message what we people don't understand a delusion the Bible said he chose the delusion to give you and the thing is the Bible said he gives you a delusion so you can believe a lie in other words let me put it this way I've heard people talk about our brother Jeff he said he really believes that he's telling the truth he really believes he cannot even see folks he can't see he's been deceived that's why brother brother B said in that message how pitiful how pitiful but you got to understand that was a choice brother bam said before you can uh uh go in error you have to refuse truth you got to refuse it people seeing a man they couldn't see God same thing Israel did let's stand it ain't the this is folks you watch it's going to be a lot more oh this one that one that one you'll see but don't you let nobody persuade you in that nonsense I like I said I'd rather be the weakest Saint there is than to deny it uh-uh uh uhuh I know it's true I don't nobody have to persuade me I know it's true he revealed that and that's got to be a re Revelation in you cuz if you don't you'll sell your brother Mother sister brother your husband wife you'll sell them out at the end cuz that's the pressure that's coming you love God
