TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you [Music] [Music] let's say Amen when the Spirit of the Lord we know that song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wonderful song amen praise the Lord that God had a some flavor to the service this morning not pulling long in the time we're just going to get right into the Word of God we thank God for everybody that did come out especially our musicians amen I usually call him brother Lee's but he like Lee's Paul he's in Canada so we thank God for him and all of the brother in coming up there was an announcement put out that somehow I made a mistaken I must have texted to the wrong place but anyhow some of those things I guess here would be would have been here but I think they're in Iowa City that was not that particular message wasn't supposed to be sent to the church here in Des Moines they have a guest speaker by from South Africa or the Ponzo I believe his name and so he'd be preaching at brother ease and you know my promise was to be here by God's grace so we're here and we just thank God for His grace before why in the service this morning I just kind of want everybody to see what my plans are concerning this church and the church in Iowa City so we'll have a better understanding of what's going on by God's grace you love the Lord Amen as we stand let us turn to the scripture to passage of Scripture let us go to 2nd Timothy please second Timothy the first chapter will read the ninth and 10th verses in the original King James and then will read a little further in the amplified I kind of like it the way it sounds I just really adds a little flavor or greater understanding by God's grace it just put a little more power into it I don't normally do this but every now and again when I feel inspired to do it I I do it by God's grace 2nd Timothy 1 beginning at the 9th verse who have saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who have abolished death and have brought life immortality to light through the gospel ok you got that will read the amplified version for it is he who delivered and saved us and called us with the calling in himself holy and leading to holiness to a life of consecration a vocation of holiness he did it and not because of anything of merit that we have done but because of love and to further his own purpose and grace unmerited favor which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began eternal ages ago it is the purpose and grace which he now has made known and has fully disclosed and made real to us through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who will know death and made it of no effect and brought life immortality death and they brought life and immortality to light through the gospel we're into I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed but I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him amen I kind of jumped in that but nevertheless by God's grace God knows what he's doing hold fast the form and sound words which thou has heard of me and in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus let us pray father God we come before your Lord and we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love we pray Lord God this morning that your perfect will will be done lord I pray hallelujah that you open the hearts and the minds of the people that they may hear and be able to see and Lord receive most of all your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we just want to start by God's grace on a different thought but something that will basically tie into the things that we've been talking about previously it is our desire to preach a word where we can understand and not only grass in our hearts the perfect will of God why because we are in a stage of crisis ministry it's not mine as he is we're in that God is himself is about ready to quicken our bodies and change us to go to a place where Paul express eyes have not seen ears have not heard but I believe with all my heart that we are part of that group it is a small group it is an electric group it's a group that has been chosen before the foundation of the world brother Branham talks about it and he tells us that even our inheritance wasn't given by Jesus Christ it was given by God himself before there was what we call Jesus he was Elohim he was the Almighty God the self existing one he was as we said Elohim but the prophet of God said then he became l li Elohim meaning that God was going to produce more of himself he himself desired to have children and the only way that he could be a family man he had to produce and make a family and so therefore we understand now through just that why God even in the book of Genesis said that each seed shall bring forth of his kind because God did not know how to bring anything outside of himself you see when God created everything God called it good that word good is perfect that word good is God because Jesus said when the rich young ruler I asked I said to him good master we know that thou art a teacher come from God and Jesus responded to the rich young ruler there is only why call it thou me good because there is only one good and that's God so when we come to see where God is bringing us us III entitled this message today as the message of freedom because you got to realize that we are coming to understand we are free and you can no longer be you can know but you cannot be any freer how can I say this if in your mind you are free you are free and when I say mind I mean the mind of your heart not the mind of your head because in your mind you can be free but yet be a prisoner prophet of God talks about a little crow that had a had been set free Johnny crow said his master actually set him free but because he had been in a habitual cycle going around the pole constantly he never noticed that the court that once had him bound had been cut and that's what I say to Christians even those who consider themselves bribed if you don't allow the Word of God to wash your mind cleanse you from all those things that have you in bondage though you be free you're still in bondage because you will not cut the cord that literally have you chained and the cord that we're talking about that has you chained as your own imagination because Christ cut the cord and now we are free when I think about the prophet of God ministering to us the message it is the rising of the Sun I think about those those slavery days when the Emancipation Proclamation was given whether random tells about the story how these saved slaves went on top of the hill those who could run to the top of the hill and they ran up to the top of the hill because they could see the Sun rising quicker than those that were in the valley and he said that those are slaves when they saw the Sun and the Sun hit them they knew that a new day had come and they began to shout we're free we're free well you see those that were in the valley could only take their word but they began to shout we're free even though the Sun had not yet touched their place and this is where we're in this mess is just message as a rising message and as it rises the Sun beginning gets stronger in our lives not the SU in the S o N and as we began to embrace a revelation of the sunlight we find out that the darkness that once had us in prison has now faded away we must understand that the penalty or the excuse me the price in which it took to pay for our deliverance words cannot express how great this price was because we find out that in the book of Revelation I believe it was the fifth chapter where no man was found worthy to loose us from the bondage in which sin had placed us in the Bible said there was only one and that one man was Jesus Christ who the Bible calls the lamb John looked for a lion and he saw a lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world I like that because it didn't say that the lamb was slain ad 33 but said that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world brother Branham explained that to us that before we even came into this dimension God had already slain a lamb he slew a lamb having each and every one of us in mind so that we can understand what the blood of Jesus Christ is all about it wasn't what we would say as the world has you know concocted to be it is much more than that it's more than Easter eggs and Easter bunnies and you know going to church with nice clothing on it was about the atonement that God had already set in his mind to do what to set you free in order for God to be just God Himself had to provide a way of escape you see what I'm saying say it like this God knew that when he placed Adam and Eve in the garden God knew that they would fall and that fall would serve his purpose but God being a just God also knew that in order for mankind to get out of the situation that he himself put himself in he would need an atonement he would need a sacrifice and as the Prophet God said that God did not send the secretary he came himself and we find out that this message not only just brings us to a place of Liberty but because of the message we now understand that this saw entrapped us it brought us into a place some of us we didn't have a choice in this dimension but because of the choices or the the way we chose before this all happened God put our names in the Lamb's Book of Life in other words when Lucifer was overthrown in heaven we thought with Micah we thought him and we defeated him even then that's why God could have confidence because as you were in your theophany or in the thought in the mind of God you can't change you oh you are that's why no matter how wicked this world is in the true believer there's always that desire to overcome that desire amen to do the perfect will of God that doesn't come it didn't come by way of Lucifer God gave you that a representation something that you can have that would motivate you in this dark and evil age you're up the Lord yes this message of freedom is something that the whole world should know about whether they would accept it I don't know but God just inspired me to make sure that as I preach I speak comfortably to Zion we're here to be conferred to cause you and I must understand we know this that every one of us are now experiencing a lot of stress in our lives pressure from everywhere and you must understand what the grace of God he is it's not him that will it nor he that run it but God who shows mercy hallelujah it's not based upon what you do it's about what he's already done that's why we had a message that could actually tell us you're so justified you never sinned in the first place that all came through the blood of Jesus Christ y'all hear me it all came through him and by him Amen we are accepted as the scripture says in the beloved but you locked every one of us are mocked you came into this world mocked because God mocks you not when you were born before you were born you were mock is that right yes that's why God could say Jacob my love and Esau I hate because those kids were mocked because they will mock back then if you stood with Christ then Christ will stand with you now that's why the Bible said that the Lord knoweth them that I hear when you talk about being mark you talking about something that's visible a visible impression or something you know something that that exposes you like Cain Cain says Lord what I'm gonna do you mark to me how can I hide God said don't worry about hiding huh I'll make sure no one anyone whoever if they find you they won't kill you you see and just as Cain was marked you mocked sometimes you feel like an oddball sometimes you mean feel a little stupid because you don't go with the flow you can't even help it but that's God a man who has mocked you has already determined by his foreknowledge who you are and who you going to be is that right Jeremiah couldn't get out of the fact that he was called to be a prophet and you can't get out of the fact that you was called to be bribed and just like God by his own will make Jeremiah come to a place to perform all his duties remember Jeremiah wanted to quit but there was something on the inside of Jeremiah that wouldn't allow him to quit and he said no I can't do it even though the Hall of Israel but that polluted look like nobody will be saved he said yet Estill this fire shut up in my bones hallelujah y'all know what I'm talking about sometimes the pressure gets so difficult and so hard you want to throw up your hands but yeah and still there's something on his side oh it's not that you holding him he's holding you big lorry - his name probably God in adoption 3 says there's been a dispensation of well there's been a dispensation of Mosaic law y'all know that there was a dispensation of John there was a dispensation you know of Christ there's been a distance ation of the church ages or organizations and there's been a outpouring of the Holy Spirit but I want you to understand the reason why I'm preaching the way I preach you know we're talking about going to a new world we're talking about going to a better place we talked about going to a home amen is that right even we're now understanding that we're not in just a dispensation of the Holy Spirit or the dispensation of of organization we are in the dispensation of adoption and you and I must understand that if we are in the dispensation of adoption that's all that's going to make a rapture those who will be adopted hallelujah that's why you said well what do you mean brother books listen if you can understand your freedom like I said it's only in your mind that you're in prison because the court has already been calm cut hallelujah if God have justified you as though you've never seen in the first place then where does sin who you hallelujah it's not him that will it law he that runnable God who shows mercy is that right not by power not by might not let your strength human ability has nothing to do with this it's by my spirit saith the LORD it is God amen in his anointing he is the one who destroys the yokes oh that's why that song was so good when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart I will dance like David danced when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart I will pray he like Daniel prayed you see it is the Spirit of God and if you don't allow the Spirit of God to take over in your life you'll be like that fig tree that is real cursed excuse me Jesus cursed right it was a fig tree it represented Israel but it had no fruit when the son of man came by hallelujah he wanted service from the tree and there was no service he could find it's like some of us God didn't call you into this message he meant to sit down on your gifts your abilities that he's given you hallelujah don't you know if we don't preach everything brother branham preach hallelujah he was able to say it like this as Paul said if an angel come from heaven and preached anything outside of which i apprec-- let it be a curse hallelujah and Jesus came to see fruit on the tree and found no fruit when he comes to expect yo tree what will he find is this okay and when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time see you must understand we're moving into the fullness of time if you want to say it we're really there because it overlaps and you and I must understand if that be true which it is everything is coming to an end everything that has time attached to it everything that's why God has to give us an eternal body a body that can last for eternity because time will be no more you'll never grow old hallelujah because it is only time that makes us grow old in this dimension so you and I must understand Amen when they talk about the fullness of time we're talking about amen when the Dead Rises when sickness ceases when the earth ceases to grow and the earth will continue to grow until the manifestations of the sons of God are manifested seen till that word that have mocked you hallelujah see we're not here to mock the word to imitate the word but the word is supposed to identify you and who you are hallelujah you and I must understand Amen according to the message of adoption he says listen his shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us it has to be that way you can't say I'm in the message and you're not growing you're not even sanctified you haven't received the Holy Ghost yet that sounds harsh but I want you to understand why you've got a part to play is that right Oh God amen didn't need David to pick up stones but somehow the inspiration came no where did gossip pick up five stones by his own inspiration he was so in town tuned to God he picked up five stones knowing Goliath had brothers he wasn't just willing to destroy Goliath but he was ready for the brothers that made him what more than a conqueror and you and I must understand that just people say well you don't have to live sanctified well let me tell you like this then why did the sanctified age the age of sanctification was required for them justification right was Luther Wesley was what sanctification and if they had to meet the criteria of their age you've got to meet that - you got to meet the justification aids the certification aids the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah and brother Brandon brought it all the way up to four he said the person of Jesus Christ must live in you and me that is the manifestation of the sons of God this is what scares me because we find that even among believers we've got so many believers who can shout and dance and run and amen I could give you a quote or two and we can praise God for the profit of God but when it comes to living it the devil's got to see hello oh yes he's gotten to see that all praise God and this is where he use it you are so justified you never sinned in the first place and we ride that horse we ride that coat and we never work on being sanctified but that quote was given to those who's not only justify sanctified but filled with the Holy Ghost and sealed hallelujah in other words you're just potential until you measure up to the statue yes somebody help me here we're talking about of freedom let me ask you something cause I know some of your thoughts you let the devil get you because of your human effort Lord I'm trying to do this Lord I'm trying to do this and Lord I'm trying to do that and see that's the problem you're the one that's trying anything about you trying they overcame by the word of their testimony and the blood of the Lamb hallelujah you don't have a testimony without a test hallelujah you've got to go through it I think that's what you've got to overcome it cuz brother Branham said it like that he said every one of those virtues are victories and you cannot have a victory without a battle that's why he said we must die and right to ourselves ain't no use in us thinking we gonna make a rap I got a quote brother and said have you slothful and sluggish he said you will not make a rapture I got it if you want to see it I got it you're not gonna make a rapture being slow for I didn't say he didn't say you weren't saying but you won't make a rap to be in that way because God would that you be hot or cold lukewarm or spew you out of your mouth his mouth the danger of lukewarm is this the Bible according to Hebrew 6 I believe he says if we coming to the knowledge of the truth like the Prophet God said if we come and we began to taste of the grapes and the things that on the other side and we turned back now you stop not talking about a week saying he didn't I tell my somebody who really believed that that in the Holy Ghost and they really want it but the devil tricked him and they come caused him to go back that's not now he's talking about he's talking about those who are willfully ignoring the fact that they need the Holy Ghost and they and-and-and-and-and fail to go forward with it because there's so many people who believe they don't believe they don't they don't need the Holy Ghost some people believe that certain man certain leaders are their Holy Ghost would that have been so easy if brother Branham would have been my Holy Ghost that meant I would not have needed it hallelujah but to see it ain't the way it is hello oh you're getting quiet let me say it like this Jesus needed the Holy Ghost he was baptized of John and he needed the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost came down on him and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in and that same thing applies to us you need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost we need more of him until we reach that stage of perfection in the mind of God we are just like Jeremiah was a prophet in the mind of God before he was a prophet hallelujah and we are perfected in the mind of God but you must understand there are roads and steps we must take in order to get there coming into the full stature of Christ meaning you coming into the full statue of a man in the way Adam long before the fall like I said you know it was the sin that brought us into this place where babies are born but God taken us to a place where there are no babies everything is mature oh come on somebody you won't have no educational colleges there will have to worry about having those schools hallelujah you said well what do you mean limitation see that's where Satan has deceived people though nothing wrong with degrees if you're gonna serve God with all your heart for Satan makes people believe that they're more intelligent they're smarter they're better they have a better crop amen as if they can think and they got a education well I just feel like that sounds a lot like Cain you know who thought he had it all together and because of his high education he thought God was gonna accept him and God said ain't gonna happen nothing wrong with education is all good as long as you put God first I'll tell somebody um you can get three doctorate get it if you're gonna serve the Lord it'll make it easier on this side when it comes to living it's okay but when it comes to God and God's kingdom you know what we need we can even him we don't need nothing else we need God seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these other things will be added that all right Oh coming from the message perfection sometimes we don't realize who God is God is not an amateur he's not the prophet God said he doesn't have to be educated God don't go to school he is he's the most intelligent being there is and will ever be the most intelligent being and nobody will ever supersede him He is God hallelujah he's being he's a being of infinite who cannot lie cannot speak anything contrary knows everything just as perfect at the beginning as he is at the ending and just as perfect at the end as he was from the beginning whoa God is in this this is your message like eternity you can't never find the corner of a perfect circle you could run around through ages and eternity and they'll never never never be an end to it hallelujah and that's the way God is and when he's first God which was was he was Infinite perfect to begin with and he always be the same he never can change he is perfectly the same I love that because I don't have to worry about God getting Moody on me and changing because sometimes we do that we get Moody and we change God never changed he's always there for us even even when we don't deserve him he's always there hallelujah how are you going to get rid of him he's in the Sun he's in the moon he's in the stars he's in the air you breathe he's everywhere you can't get rid of it you know God where are you and you breathe in his air hallelujah the very thoughts in your mind is computed rise or can I say like this um work because God is if God was to die don't you know everything would cuz he's life he's the only thing that is life hallelujah right now this great chain of perfection was broken by the time-space I love that time-space that little piece of space of time huh you know what James says he said that little piece of time or space is like a vapor that's all you get and people will turn chained to ask you mean people will trade that little space of a vapor for eternal life it makes no sense and for those of us who are older are we have become elders I met a friend of mine in the store yesterday he said oh yes I'm a I'm an elder man I'm I'm you know I get I get Triple A now I'm thinking he's about my you know he said well I said well how old are you he said 55 I said well I'm assuming to be 64 I said I'm really I'm 64 and if you asked my daddy he says I'm 65 he said they messed up on my birth certificate now you know he should know so if I'm 65 it's okay in this life I'm 65 but over there y'all understand you think I'm gonna trade this thing that's wrinkling up getting ball right and what hasn't turned gray has already turned loose do you really think I'm gonna trade this life for that one let me say it like this we all must suffer don't ain't easy if brother Branham had to choose that narrow and straight way the hard way in order to follow him that harder way must become your way there's no way out of it the world is not going to accept you they can feel the difference my wife and I was in a restaurant the other day and this young boy come through you know he had some issues and you know at first when he saw me you know he kept carrying on with his his actions but when he saw my wife with me something changed he got so nervous it wasn't the way we looked it was the atmosphere will you carry the right atmosphere the devil gets nervous I know you and some of us will so Connell we think we're where that's wrong with us no nothing wrong with you it's what you're packing when the Holy Ghost is in you darkness began to tremble when they see light is that right oh you say give me scripture when when Legion saw Jesus before he even opened his mouth he confessed thou son of God hallelujah have you come to torment us it's your atmosphere you must understand that when William Branham did he did not come to be a single a single individual like I said I am giving you a message the message came from God right but me giving you the message I had to eat this message first right but that doesn't make me it it doesn't make me him it makes me a part of him and I'm giving you this right now I'm the messenger and the messenger is a reflection of the one that you cannot see don't look at me like I'm crazy that's the same with Jesus Christ Holly I asked you a question if you so smart Amen then who did Jesus Christ have to please he had to please his father then that means there was someone greater than his flesh it's a revelation I know but if you don't understand the revelation between Jesus Christ and God you'll never understand the revelation between you and Christ father I would they be one even as we are one hallelujah but Jesus knew though the flesh separated him from that net that that eternal spirit he understood I can't do nothing except I see the father he understood it was that live amen in the beginning that thought about a son oh it doesn't make them to their one just like the bride will have a number of them that no man can number and there yet and still be one because there's one Holy Spirit there's one God and Jesus Christ God it had the same Holy Ghost right it was the Holy Ghost the part said I will not let his his soul his flesh see corruption who was that it was God he spoke the word didn't happen it happened and if you don't see where I'm talking about let me tell you something you know what happens you get in your reasoning and you become an idolater because reasoning is the beginning of becoming an auditor God don't come by reason God come by faith hallelujah thank God for revelation you say what do you mean flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father What did he say I revealed it he didn't he said my father which is in heaven he hath believe this thing unto you O let us stop the tunas and the three days ain't number one God and it'll always be one God is this ok I know it's different from what you've heard some of us but it still remains the truth brother Branham had to know the truth when he saw those rainbows coming down like that and that voice came how did the rainbow it says the God Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new he wasn't talked about the me that's why Paul says listen I know this gospel but we do not know Jesus Christ after the flesh see when I look at brother Branham and I say yes God was there I know what I'm saying I understand I'm not talking about the flesh of the man I'm talking about the God that was in the man you understand me and whenever you and I do anything that's good that's right that's holy we're not talking about the man part we're talking about the god part there is no good thing in the flesh none none not any zero this is because God in earth how on earth is you gonna see the image of Christ if you're looking back and seeing the image of something else that little boy when he looked up there in that mirror he said mama that's me brother Brennan told us to look into the mirror of the word and when our reflection bares his reflection that's me I've been born by Jesus Christ and so have you you understand me is this okay going to little longer than I expected Paul said I press toward the mark of a high calling I'm talking about freedom y'all it sounds like bondage I'm losing it almost sound like I'm preaching law I'm not preaching law I'm preaching grace but I'm telling you what grace is requiring hallelujah grace is requiring and the Bible says we ought to take advantage of grace because grace abounds hallelujah we're seeing the poundabout said grace did abound the more you know what that means abundant more than enough don't tell me you won't make it amen I can't make it when there's more than more grace than you can imagine we make our choices he made but grace is in favor for us and of us hallelujah as you have heard me say grace is God's God's timepiece or time amen to to make it right it's not to continue insane is that right Paul says shall we continue in sin that grace may abound he said god forbid I am free and that's the power amen or it says in addition area the power to determine actions without restraint is that right God said whatsoever you will no restraints if I lay hands on the sick they shall recover no restraints hallelujah is that right - gosh how many squirrels did he want huh he said three I think one time he he was it five how many I forgot the number there was fire but he was going to stop and the Holy Spirit said you said see because you got to understand the word was so powerful in him if he had changed his mind that would have been like God changing his mind he had already asked for it God said is yours so he had to follow through with this word if he's gonna be like it that's what I'm saying if you ask God for anything you can't not remake back on it you've got to go forward you can't say Lord I didn't mean seven I didn't mean eight you whatever comes out of your mouth you don't stop until you get you gotta keep forward with this didn't you not believe what you just spoke that's right don't even speak it if you don't have faith in what you believe it oh I love this this is just the beginning I said I'm just throwing out a format trying to lay something out because I believe it like the scripture says if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed and I look like that word make when somebody make you do something that's different that means you have a choice and you might not want to do it but he gonna make you do it he going force it how do you what are you talking about brother Bruce Jonathan said I ain't going in there never God's are you going but the word doesn't went out you got to go see you can go the easy way or the hard way but you're going to do what God say do it's gonna happen some of us amen we'll be ready before the squeeze some of us won't be ready until the squeeze it's your choice like like the Prophet God said you could be led by a lamb you could be led like a lamb or you can be driven like cattle and God go do one of the other because he won't come short in his number he goes they all I got five one two three four with that fifth one right is that right listen God knew Peter was going to faint because of his his decisions to deny him we all didn't I am sometime in our actions hmm sometimes when we don't speak up to witness for him we deny him but God can't do without you if God has ordained you to be in a place and at a certain time don't worry you're gonna get there and he said listen I don't care I'm calling a meeting I'm calling a conference and whatever you do I want to give you some final instructions don't come without Peter you see that's what I'm saying we judge one another in such a way and we forget that all of us sinners saved by grace and God amen we look at this thing we fail to see Amen that God is expecting you that had the kind of grace he has on you is that the way that's to err give you a story of the word the Bible says it meant that men who old a lot of debt God forgave him of the dead but then when it came to his paying debt his servants paying his debt he persecuted the servant you know what God called that man y'all know what your God called me call us when we persecute people people who fall short we want God to forgive us of all our sins but we don't forgive others we hold our grudges and we feel like we have a right to do so well maybe this man thought the same thing but when Jesus heard by way of someone else what this rich man had done what this man had done so wait a minute I just forgave him of all my office all he says and you need to tell me that this man somebody offended him and he won't forgive woo I know I'm in the right place now right you mean to tell me you're not going to forgive then Jesus said I won't forgive you either the judge says not only will I not forgive you but everything I have forgiven you for I'm taking it back there somebody helped me here that's terrible that's a judgment that everything God has forgiven me for and then he's taking it back because I won't forgive one person they're dead that's how it's going to be because if you don't have the ability to forgive you need to ask God to help you and let me tell you something your imagination is something else yes if it's not converted here you will imagine all kind of evil things against your brother and your sister you will formulate things in your mind and to you that that image that you place in your mind will become your lifestyle you'll live it you will live it and that individual can be innocent is this okay let me let me read this scripture by God's grace and then I'll cut it short because I want you to understand like I said this is just we're free but we have a law and I'm gonna read out a Deuteronomy 26 they're getting at the sixteenth first since this day the Lord thy God have commanded thee to do these statues and judgments thou should therefore keep and do them with all thine heart and with all thy soul thou has a vouched the Lord this day to be thy God and to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments in his judgments and to hearken unto his voice and the Lord have about these this day to be his peculiar people as he had promised thee and that thou should have keep all his commandment this came to my heart some of y'all may not I'm sure you're aware that there was a time when Billy Paul back slid on brother branham it got so bad till you know he was that death door right but you know during the time that Billy Paul back slid brother Branham became its friend he could not just come in his house and do anything he he wanted to do he had to be somewhere else you understand me in other words that's what perfect love does that what that's what it will do in a time when it's really like I said extreme well y'all here the other day extreme you know when things are so intense sometime we worry about what people think or their conception of you guarding concerned about one thing every test in trial will be conquered by divine love and divine love only who somebody help me here see so you got to understand you need divine love to escape is that right the probably God said that's the only only virtue he said you got it in this day he said that's what you gotta have because that's what's over there and if you're not pressing the battles to get it hallelujah in other words God's gonna put things in your way he's gonna allow things to come now don't get me wrong because you forgive somebody and that you love somebody you thought you're not ignorant you're not gonna tolerate them constantly doing things wrong and not bring the judgment is that right don't get me wrong but in all of that you've got to love the sinner I love the individual you can't let bitterness because bitterness will come and stop your growth in Christ see I know I tell you what I tell you what let me say it like this if anybody know what they're preaching I do you don't know the trials and tests I go through and sometimes my old flesh amen walnut walnut want to rise up y'all know it if you don't kill it it arise you gotta kill this thing every day and when you see yourself beginning to think evil you gotta say Lord forgive me and sometimes you got to get on your knees and pray cause all of a sudden if you don't stop that gospel that Satan is preaching in your ears you will accept it and then you when you accept his gospel you are accepting a spirit with it a strong hope if you don't get rid of it you know I'm in a place right now in my life I really don't care what nobody thinks of me I got people who think good of me and I got people who think evil of me and you think I care no you know why I gotta go I got a mark I got a place I'm looking at I'm pressing in spite of all my shortcomings and failures I'm pressing that's the way I feel that's where I am I have a goal you know when I was in Trinidad and everything I did Minister a couple of times even though I went over there the rest but people like they said brother you broke two you ain't the same man you're not the same man that once come here you're not the same man something has changed they saw God not me they couldn't get over it but what I'm trying to say is it ain't me is God and yet we'll sit right here and don't see God we see man brother Brooks if that's all you see you missed the whole service because when you come to church you know what you must do every service unveil the man God must be unveiled the moment you begin to just see human you've miss it you're not hearing you're not hearing with your heart you're hearing with you brother Brooke said but when you unveil it and you see God and you know that only God knows my troubles let me say like this you're not seeing me over no crystal ball trying to find out what you're doing in the daytime or night care from that standpoint the only thing I see is what God wants me to see y'all understand me guess what before I left here I told you about those snakes I told you about seeing snakes and vision something and for the first time when I went over to I was in Guyana a poisonous snake because where we were staying curled up and one of the fountain cow because I had that impression all morning about a snake and this uh I didn't know that other pastor had the impression to y'all see my lying in there with the snake on the that's my God gave me that I mean it is deep because I realized that even here and everywhere else you're dealing with witchcraft but God showed me the grace of God would give me grace to conquer it and you know i its mode is deeper than that so anyway the young brother the pastor's son went and bought a rubber snake and I'm thought to myself I'm thinking this oppression is coming and why am I thinking this and then the brother dies a rubber snake and he's playing with it and I'm talking about man round 21 years old playing with a rubber snake and I thought it was weird so anyway he was playing with it now I'm looking at the real snake now I'm looking at a real snake right there by the bathroom and I'm thinking it was the rubber snake and I looked because it was you know getting dark and I couldn't see clearly and I'm like no that's that rubber snake but to make it make a long story short as soon as I thought there the pastor come right by I walked by and when he walked by the snake curled so he went he got he got a slingshot and he who he hit the snake in the back he hit him again boom and I said go ahead crushes hang it I'll interfere guess what the snake's head was crushed you see where brother was what what you didn't do it I spoke it and he was influenced by the words come on it was God I think it was I know it was God any man and I obviously out of all those things I thought yes Lord you made you said what brother what are you saying I'm saying this remember brother branham I got it in the nose but he he God was bringing him to a higher level in his ministry and he said you know you got to be more sincere you know people's away that we're in the third pool you ain't no third pool you got it in your head you're in the third pool if you live in it you ain't Athiya understand me the third pool is not in intellect or something in your head it's life if anybody was in the third pull before the third pole with the Prophet but God told him you got to be more sincere is that right and so the serpent comes in way of a vision and the Prophet didn't even really not wrath he didn't know what it was but God was teaching him not not with a slingshot he was teaching him how to bind the serpent with his mouth hallelujah he the words had to come out of his mouth to bind the serpent hallelujah and that's where we're moving not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord we must come to a place where all works must cease hallelujah and when Adam was in the Garden of Eden before the fall he never worked but he spoke it Oh somebody help me here and in the bride of Jesus Christ we're moving into that realm where the spoken word will be the authority of the bride of Jesus Christ she were buying every sickness she will stop everything by the Word of God even the resurrection came by the spoken word in closing so you'll know where we hid it you and I must understand brother Brennan said the voice of the resurrection is in the bride you've heard me say this before so I'm gonna tell you take it scripturally so you know the Bible said when when Adam and Eve fell the voice of God walked so the voice was not a sound it was a person because it walked Young's dimming the perfection of Jesus Christ walked in the cool of the evening hallelujah huh when the prophet of God was here the voice of God we call it right was in the Prophet no doubt about that one right but now that the veil according to Hebrew when the veil is taken away we see who the Lord so the veil is taken away but brother Branham explained it to us all that was in God he poured it into Christ in all that was in Christ he poured it into his not one drop was spilled oh right that means all that means what God working with he must pour it into the bride see the voice of the resurrection doesn't come by just yes just you it's Christ in you the full statue of Christ in you that is the voice oh come on he said the bride won't do nothing until she gets at us say it the Lord so the voice of the resurrection is God in you giving you the dust at the Lord's that's where we're headed we're moving into the everybody so our old brother books I don't see that among the people let me tell you all something only a few only a few you mean among this message only a few right like the Prophet God said you don't don't say uh I said I'm in the message he said no that's that's all that said wrong he said you got you need to say the message is in me there's a lot of people in the message when the message is not in them and so I say this thing by God's grace and we'll pick it up this evening by God's grace we having communion for those who want to be here and can't come I know this was not announced but you know it so with the lateness we understand if you cannot make it so but anyway we will be having service if we just got two or three sometimes it gets down to that you know my son when he came here he said he got so discouraged I said why he said daddy says now I'm not boasting I'm not I'm just repeating what he said basically said daddy you have such a gift that you could have all kinds of people whatever hi if I said I'm just cutting it short I said Isaiah this church has been a choice I made by God presenting it to me you understand me I could have stayed where I was there a lot of people there but I'm not interested in numbers I'm interested in quality see now I hope about me saying that I have troubles and I have had troubles but I can truly say this little flock that God has given I really count you as jewels if you only knew some of the things pastors have to go through with their flocks but we don't have all of that we have some issues but thank god they're not as bad as others you know what I mean you say why are you saying brother let me say like there's every man that have tried to overtake this position God has gotten rid of them I didn't have to do it God did it Wow I didn't put myself here God did it alright and I thank God for every one that we have for you because I want you to realize by God's grace amen I believe by what God has convicted me of and have shown me not only would I make a rapture but there gonna be some of us who will make a rapture that's what I'm here for I'm not here to be glorified I'm not here to be get a great maid I had all of that they used to call me in America when I was like I said when they lied to me I was wanted to top ten whatever that means when I heard that I thought my god is time for me to get out of Dodge I don't want to be a part of the top ten you know what let me say this that I'm closing for real now every time I see the message people come together the way they do with no change I think about vest I vasty having her parties with her girls and not approaching the call of the king God wants to show off his beauty in the bride not in partying not in in having church services and everybody's shouting and carrying on and all that's good but where is that simple girl where's that girl who's majoring in character because mallet Mordecai Dunn told her what the King likes ooh I don't feel it I don't care if I'm not popular I don't care if they call me simple as simple can get if I am simple at least I know I'm still within the framework of the word because God is revealing simplicity and I thank God because I am striving to make a rapture and I'm trusting that you are to one more quote from adoption 3 because we must realize your walk must be in the word that's the only way we can walk he not walk with God God was the word brother Balaam said it like this he says an adoption 3 but holy holy holy unto the Lord what is he talking about he's talking about people who were truly born again let his word be first let it be everything that there is some settled in your heart your walk must be in the word holy holy holy unto the Lord you understand that because the Bible said holiness without no man should see God so what is holy not you your flesh shall never be holy it's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost on the mountain and let me say it like this the reason why we fail is because we still need the Holy Ghost hmm the devil knows as long as he can keep you unsanctified he can keep you unsealed do that right oh it's true your walk must be in the word holy holy holy unto the Lord now if God don't take natural vessels according to Leviticus and make sure that they're that sprinkle with blood and everything to make sure that they are holy and presented to be to place them in to the Holies of Holies what about these living vessels and you know we wasted our time we really wasted our time because we feel like because we believe that God sent a prophet we're gonna make it Milius knew that Moses was a prophet sent by God hallelujah is that right holy holy holy unto the Lord you don't don't don't don't get in God's face and said Lord you know that demon of lust amen was more powerful than you that's what you're saying if you can't overcome the lust demon you're saying that the demon is greater than God it doesn't matter which which area the last year lusts of the flesh whether they are proud a lie still lust and these things we must overcome how you going to overcome if you're not praying how are you gonna overcome if you're not fasting I know and I got something close on fasting too because a lot of people don't believe we should well we got the bridegroom you don't have to fast okay brother Branham fasted did he not have the bridegroom that's why we're so carnal when you fast it it helps your spiritual man it weakens your flesh is this okay listen holy holy holy you got your eyes set toward Calvary and there's nothing going to stop you how many feel that way the very walk of your life the very walk of your life you're walking down the Kings Highway unordered with the precious anointing oil moving to the Holies of Holies it's a walk you got to move into the Holies of Holies you can't stay out here in the outer court justified just sanctified you got to move wawk wawk wawk wawk is that right the probably God had to walk that way the same way it's a process it's a moving forward it's dying out to everything rotting so God can use you every born-again Christian has a road set before you you've got to follow that road God mocks it out it mocks by the blood and the spirit always lives in the blood because through the blood comes life blood cells it's the life cell now we follow him being and we see how the road maps directs us show which a way we're going it's always been is God provided way for us and the word is God provided way it's not going to be easy don't even think it but I guarantee you should you get there you know is worthwhile it's worth the Lord put on my heart a thought my little girl or my grandbaby Esther she takes piano lessons and every now and again she has her little recitals you ain't gonna have no recital and I thought what's the purpose of of a recital a recital is given so that you can see the accomplishments of that child whatever instrument they're playing you you want to see progress because when she first came she couldn't play at all but now she can play mary had a little lamb right to you it may not be much you know but to that child that's accomplishment because I can play mary had a little lamb lamb with both hands and most of us might not be able to do this thing thing thing thing you know so it's an accomplishment now the next recital she has is not gonna be all mary had a little lamb it means that now that she has come up to this level the work in which she's going to be given will be a little more complicated then there's another recital and as she continues to grow in the knowledge of being able to play then the work becomes more complicated right brother Branham talks about a music sheet playing with the right beats and the right tune the right distance I brother whatever the case may be buddy says that's the way God is now if you know anything about drama you know that just before the end the whole thing come to a culmination right now you're going to see everything that started out that the very harvest of it whether and you're going to see the victory of the of the person who's been let's say of the victim and then you go you're going to see you don't see the destruction of the bad person that's what it usually is good and evil very seldom evil wins because everything is a mimic of the Bible good and evil but the point is at the end of the day everything is even if the play starts off mysterious at the end of the play all the mystery is gone now you see everything now I remember oh soap opera that you said I don't forgot the name of the soap opera but then they they used to have it who killed Junior it's the truth it was a mystery and they prayed that thing for a long time because they knew they had the attention of the people y'all know what I'm saying Oh y'all know what I'm saying every one of y'all people who still looking at those movies and you see you got the episode coming it's the truth they're dramatized that thing till you got to see the next one right and you gotta understand that it's okay the interest that you have because that's exactly what God has done you said well what do you mean yes he has the angels of the Lord looks they look at us in expectation the Bible said we are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses we are their television set they are watching us yes they are president said God are the angels with the brother and says Lord have you seen what's going on down there in Babylon they watching they looking they don't know the next episode they don't see a minute ago they know by word but they look to see what's going on God and falls to him them just like he unfolds to us otherwise why would they say yes if they did know that Daniel was going to be third in the line again or never the Hebrew boys were going to be in the fiery furnace your angel your theophany reports to God every day the things you do and say everything and if it wasn't for them we'd be somewhere laying in the ditch because often time we're too prideful to say lord help me and really mean it I'm done I'm done with this but the greatest thing is this the whole earth heaven and earth is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God and that's why the seals were open that's why the book was roofs it was to set us free God's last weapon tree whoa the bride of Jesus Christ who triumphs over the devil who defeats the serpent by putting the serpent under her is it not true brother branham said she lives so close to him the satan wouldn't even know what to do with all those weaknesses that you once had you start speaking it I defeat you Satan I'll no longer be weak in this area huh I do you know what when Satan tries to give me a flu I curse him it works other things he give me a pain I curse old devil you a liar out of my mouth the word of the Lord proceeds and as long as you're speaking according to the word God will honor it you love the Lord Lester screaming you can make it you can make it they you can make it you can make it you can make it you can make it that's what they're screaming and you're not all of us who have not yet made it like the Bible said those of us who are perfect and those of who are trying to be perfect at that time God will bring us to a place every one of us perfect in Christ but that perfection must be manifested yes you look at it and like I said it's not what you've done what you do is what he's done for you every victory will be warned by Jesus idiot not you Jesus in you and he gives you credit for allowing him to use you the glory Lord he said Lord God the glory that I have with you give this glory to them it is a sweet salvation I love it the Bible said he makes all things beautiful in his time it is amazing how we want God to have patience with us but we can't have patience with one another Amazing Grace shall always be my song for it was grace that brought my liberty and now I know just how he came to love me he left beyond all my fault and saw my knee I shall forever lift my Knights to Calvary to view the cross where Jesus died for me how marvelous a grease take off my fallen soul whoo he'll be on my farm and saw my knee I shall forever lip my night to Calvary to view the cross where Jesus died for me how marvelous that grace that call my lob on my paw and so I need let's have a word for our system that's just to Amy brother John you're seeing as I'm sorry employees wife she lost her dad just the other day I know it must be difficult for and let's pray for her in the family just now father we come before your Lord you thank you for you Amazing Grace lord I pray that you were comfort the family Lord John and his wife Amy father be merciful to them strengthen them in this time of bereavement father God we thank you for all things we thank you for all that you do for us forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord we know that in your eyes were perfect we know we are and father we still even as Paul saying pressing toward that mark but by and through your revelation we do understand who we are we understand by God's grace that there is no sin imputed to others Lord I pray right now that you bless the saints of God unveiled don't you yourself to them that they may know how to yield to your Holy Spirit that will allow you to build and make us no man can add one cubit to this statute so therefore we're looking toward to hear for which cometh eye health we're looking toward you because you are the building because your word says except the Lord build the house those that labor labor in vain and father we don't want to labor Lord with our own strength we want to labor and allow you to labor Oh God we want you to build this house and whatever it takes for us and whatever we may go to have to go through to come to the perfection in which you have seen us to be in-laws so let it be even as Mary said Lord let it be let it be according to thy word and your name Jesus Christ we pray and we love you help us to love you even more if it's possible in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated just for a moment do anybody needs prayer yes just I'm sorry Stan I didn't know I should have asked for prayer earlier [Music] father God we come before you right now we pray for my sister right now Lord we pray that you bless her in this situation in the regulator system so God our Father lets you to feel better more safe than the blood of the Paula you guys against you and I command you the loser down Lord we speak healing and deliverance Lord in your name Jesus Christ amen father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace in your mercy we pray right hallelujah right now for my sister Lord bless her right now strengthen her right now in the Lord Lord we pray right now O God that whatever this feeling is whatever this sickness yield whatever it is there's attacking my sister body we command you to free her now in the name of Jesus Christ and by the blood in which Jesus Christ shed for the atonement of our sins thank your father for the healing purchase of your blood in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you love the Lord surely God is good to us I forgot just that quick you may be seated just for movies but got just that quick so y'all know I don't play right but God is restoring everything amen I just wanted to say that you know because we have the two churches and most of us I won't say but so much but I'm just trying to put everything in a perspective where Satan won't get the victory I was thinking and I've given it a lot of thoughts and this was our intent in the beginning you know every other every other so for until God work and do the things that I've asked him to do we're going to be working it that way and the only way that the schedule will change is that I don't have a replacement here but sometimes Troy goes places and I don't have a replacement and so therefore I have to sometime not go down to Iowa City because of it but I want to be a faithful steward until God does what he wants me to do I've already decided by God's grace I'm not I've not been invited to go anywhere I will be going if the Lord tarry for a couple of days in January which would be the end of January and that's just for my birthday that's okay but I want to be more faithful and I don't want people I don't want the I mean I know that's what the enemy has been doing you know get me and that you know and and understand people I'm not I'm not here for power I don't glory in nothing like oh I got two churches that's nonsense God put it that me there and it happened the way it happened if he's gonna change it he'll change it you know what I'm saying but I do know that the vision in which God gave me and in the vision at which God showed me was here so I don't know how he's gonna pull it all together if he does and if he doesn't we will always be sister churches you understand me so like I'm here this weekend next week Troy would be going and I'm more than likely be in Iowa City if I can't get a replacement for Sunday coming then I will be here and I will let you know now I did make a big mistake today somehow I announced that everybody was coming down to Iowa City I don't know how I did that but that was not the original plan the original plan was to continue service here because I didn't know about the brother coming down there until the last minute and I personally have never met him so I talked with the deacons down there and so I like they all seemed like they knew him and knew of him and I knew that brother ease was having a church service so I said why don't y'all go over there so that's what I was doing I was encouraging them to go over there now brother Eve has a little difference in his doctrine but perfect love overrides that I think sometime we we get in this thing where you know I don't believe this and I don't believe that but perfect love overrides that brother branham say one might say he's coming on the white horse and one might say he's coming on cloud he said what difference does it make at least they agree he's coming you see what I'm saying and if you got enough holy goes you don't have to worry about a bad spirit getting on you huh but Jesus wash the woman's feet and they said oh he go get Tammany contaminated he had only known what kind of woman she was self-righteousness won't make it folks some of y'all can't even listen to a denominational preacher and brother branham said when you can't listen to something is that right he said he and his brothers went to this one church and he said all of a sudden the preacher preached something he said a crumb fell from the table and he says hallelujah he said they began to say praise the Lord he said something came from behind the veil and he says everybody craned their necks to see now I look understand me if I'm gonna model brother Branham in any way it would be those kinds of things you understand me it won't be wearing the belt buckle and the shoes and people get so mad they get frustrated because I say things like that because you religiously de-seed that ain't kidding you in heaven and like I tell people just like i'ma tell you this you know if you let me say like this and I'm a close on it I've said what I need to say if the name of Jesus Christ makes you feel uncomfortable you are demon-possessed you got Devils and if I just only says brother branham and that makes you all and excited and then I say the name of Jesus and all of a sudden you drop in your level you are demon-possessed there is no other name given among among men among under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ it's the truth the thing is I'm free I don't want nobody trying to tell me how many times I need to say brother Branham and ain't nobody gonna tell me I can't say Jesus out of it right nobody will provide will not fall into the program of this message how many times you heard brother Brad let me say Paul said Paul said Paul said he said but yet he preached the same message Paul preached hmm that's what people don't understand this message a bird can preach back to you if you train him well enough he can say a quote back to you exactly is that right that's what brother Branham said he said about bird brain we don't need that with this if we gonna preach this message it must come by revelation and not because you have the ability to quote what the prophets saying look at how many people knows how to quote the Prophet and look where they are now and then take those same quotes and build their kingdom with it I'm not here to build no Kingdom I'm just here to support the kingdom that has already been built and there's only one kingdom and that is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm telling you people y'all you won't deliverance you know what if I can't y'all gonna think I'm crazy but if I came and said well I deliver you in the name of William Branham y'all look at me like I'm crazy but why we want to worship everything but Jesus Christ is what I don't understand you said what do you mean I went to a church the other a couple of weeks ago I'm gonna tell you where it was we preached and one brother preached he didn't know what I was going to preach but he preached in the power of the name of Jesus and the people were disturbed it they were unsettled it was all in the spirit and they just needed they needed somebody to come in with a sword that was gonna bust that old thing and guess who it was it was Jesus Christ would he use me because I can't handle that I have grown up like I was telling him I said had we taught the people our children the proper place where brother branham is supposed to be and nobody denies that there were times he was God himself God was in the flesh like God was in Jesus like God is in you you got to see that and she does we never you know but the point is that why would brother Branham say the movies on the bride and the bride er says no but the movies on William Branham it ain't right we can't look back onward Christian soldiers marching as to war until this message become you and you become this message you're missing the whole purpose for which he came that's all I'm saying until we fall back in love with Jesus Christ these hills gonna always be dry and dull because you know why we always want something new we say more songs about the bride than we do Jesus and we fail to forget the bride wouldn't be bride without Jesus what happened to the blood wash and all of the things you know but well you know we're getting into this oh it's something now y'all gonna think I'm crazy because I'm gonna say this I'm closing for real but I told the Lord I says Lord what I see around this message I don't want to be that I don't want to be that I want what the Prophet preached living in me the Christ he had is what I won't I don't know nothing other than that I don't want nobody you know how people do with their genes put their little logos on the genes I saw a brother who had a Toyota the other day and he had a he took a Lexus hey brother I never seen one before I mean that's the way I thought but anyway my point is I try my best to keep it as pure as I can that's all I can tell you if I preach anything if I preach any other thing than Jesus Christ I even have a quote brother said brother said if we don't preach about the gifts if we don't preach things like that he said let it be a curse and how many messes churches are still preaching about gifts and trying to get the people they men to die to themselves so God can use them understand the five identification of the church must stand and the Bible to it brother Aaron said if we don't have those things among us we will be likened unto an adulteress is that the truth that's the word but then when I preach it they say I'm too Pentecostal like something I said I'm on the second pole at least I say I got to or me least I got a few what you got you know and honestly honestly I you said what about all these it ain't that I can't worry about that God don't judge me about what I preach it and the like I live here that's all I'm saying I just love the people of God wherever they may be I come across so many doctrines and things in this message you know make you nauseated let's stand but my thought is you got to know who you are you you you not your neighbor you you must know who you are and when you come to know who you are you'll never let nothing stop you will you fall sometime yes but guess what you'll get up you'll get up you realize this is the most greatest thing that ever happened in your life don't even know why God chose you you
