[41:15] to worship and to praise the lord
[41:31] of the word of god
[41:35] i do not have a message of my own
[41:38] research
[41:39] god has sent us a message
[41:45] the bible says
[41:48] 4.
[41:51] for the lord himself
[41:54] shall descend from heaven
[41:57] with a shout
[41:59] the voice of the archangel
[42:03] and the trump of god
[42:06] brother sister the prophet said in the
[42:09] message
[42:12] he said that jesus does all three of
[42:15] these
[42:18] while he's descending
[42:21] before he appears
[42:24] he said the shout out
[42:27] is a
[42:28] message
[42:30] to dress and gather the bride of jesus
[42:33] christ
[42:37] the bible said
[42:39] the lord himself
[42:56] is
[43:08] that was taken in houston texas
[43:22] [Music]
[43:26] behind a mask
[43:29] by the name of william
[43:33] a redeemed man
[43:38] a redeemed man
[43:41] holding the office
[43:45] of the seventh church age messenger
[43:50] christ himself
[44:07] christopher used a man
[44:10] to speak it
[44:12] amen
[44:15] amen
[44:18] christ
[44:19] is the actor
[44:33] coming together
[44:46] that he permitted us to see it
[44:50] [Music]
[45:01] [Music]
[45:15] i ask you for your prayers
[45:20] i i need
[45:21] the help of the lord this morning
[45:26] brother branham said
[45:29] that the gift that god places
[45:33] is not the gift to preach
[45:36] he said the gift
[45:38] was to move
[45:40] yourself out of the way
[45:43] so he could do the speaking
[45:57] i feel right at home
[46:02] god bless you this morning
[46:05] if you would be so kind as to open your
[46:07] bibles
[46:10] i'd like to take texts this morning from
[46:12] revelations chapter 3
[46:16] this is a very familiar text to us
[46:22] it is a portion of scripture
[46:26] that addresses this last church age
[46:33] and
[46:34] i want to read a portion of this
[46:39] it's addressed to the angel of the
[46:41] church of the laodicean
[46:47] where i would like to start reading this
[46:49] morning
[46:53] is verse 20.
[46:58] the scripture reads behold i stand at
[47:02] the door and knock
[47:04] if any man hear my voice
[47:07] and open the door i will come in to him
[47:11] and will sup with him and he
[47:15] with me
[47:31] to him
[47:34] i love this here
[47:36] because
[47:39] this portion of or this age of laodicea
[47:46] this
[47:48] portion of the book of revelation is
[47:51] addressed to the church
[47:56] but i want you to notice in verse 20
[48:01] he's addressing him
[48:06] because laodicea is more than just a
[48:09] church age
[48:14] it's a spiritual condition
[48:20] you can never have christ
[48:23] welcomed in the church
[48:27] until he's welcomed in here
[48:31] we are the church
[48:34] it's not the building
[48:38] it's the heart
[48:41] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[48:44] sit with me
[48:46] in my throne even as i also overcame and
[48:51] am sat down with my father in his throne
[49:07] that the third throne first throne was
[49:09] in heaven
[49:13] the second throne was in christ
[49:18] and the third throne
[49:20] is the heart of man
[49:22] [Music]
[49:24] praise the lord roger let's approach the
[49:27] author for just a moment
[49:41] from the depths of our hearts this
[49:44] morning we thank you
[49:48] for the grand privilege that you've
[49:50] extended to us this morning
[49:55] to gather together those of like
[49:58] precious faith
[50:05] under the blood of jesus christ
[50:10] and dear father
[50:13] we ask that you would have your way this
[50:15] morning
[50:18] would you this morning speak to each
[50:21] heart
[50:24] and lord whatever would hinder us
[50:29] whatever the devil has done
[50:34] we curse him this morning
[50:37] and we ask father
[50:40] that in speaking to our hearts
[50:44] that we would be set free
[50:48] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[50:53] amen amen
[50:55] god bless you may be seated
[50:59] now i'd like to start this morning
[51:03] i want to read from the message of the
[51:05] laodicean church
[51:12] and i'll be this is the uh
[51:15] message directly off the tape
[51:20] and brother branham in addressing this
[51:25] he
[51:26] tells us
[51:28] that this
[51:30] portion of the scripture
[51:33] that that i have read
[51:37] he said it's the most pathetic
[51:41] it's the saddest
[51:44] part of the bible he had ever read
[52:00] and he said that here is
[52:15] he said it's the most striking scripture
[52:20] because the very
[52:21] church
[52:23] that he died for
[52:27] has put him out
[52:30] and he's standing outside
[52:33] he said he's knocking
[52:36] trying to get back in
[52:40] to the very church
[52:43] that he desired
[52:58] let me read it to you
[53:01] he says
[53:02] i stand at the door and knock knock
[53:06] after being pushed out
[53:09] then trying to get back in
[53:12] he crawls and knocks at the door
[53:19] this is the most striking record in the
[53:21] new testament
[53:24] i think
[53:26] there's nothing could be sadder than
[53:28] this
[53:32] to see the savior of the world
[53:36] took out of his own church
[53:40] he says
[53:41] he didn't listen
[53:43] he says they were lukewarm
[53:49] said he didn't have to spew them out
[54:35] brother branham goes on to say
[54:41] [Music]
[54:49] brother branham
[55:04] that breaks
[55:25] a while ago
[55:28] i just leaned over my table and started
[55:30] crying
[56:00] simon of pharisee
[56:04] a religious leader of the day
[56:08] invited jesus to his house
[56:12] jesus came
[56:42] he said we failed to make him welcome
[56:48] brother says
[56:50] jesus
[56:52] had dirty feet
[56:56] amen he takes
[57:09] to wash them
[57:12] and make him welcome
[57:15] he tells us how that there was a harlot
[57:18] woman
[57:21] that was not invited to simon's house
[57:37] and he was being ignored
[57:51] she elbowed
[57:55] [Music]
[58:19] and she washed them
[58:47] did
[59:14] we confess he lives in
[59:22] [Music]
[59:30] christ standing outside of his church
[59:35] knocking at the door
[59:40] and brother so is he this morning
[59:43] here this
[59:44] morning
[59:46] knocking at the door of our hearts

[59:55] luckily
[59:57] it's on the inside
[1:00:12] and invite christ on the inside
[1:00:18] and then once he's inside
[1:00:23] we need to do our part
[1:00:26] to make him welcome
[1:00:29] brother branham
[1:00:34] he says here
[1:00:36] concerning this woman at the well as he
[1:00:38] tells about
[1:00:41] we know what happened with that
[1:00:44] woman mary
[1:00:47] simon was sitting there
[1:00:50] watching her
[1:00:52] wash his feet
[1:00:55] she was an ill-famed woman
[1:00:58] and simon was criticizing that
[1:01:04] but as she washed his feet
[1:01:08] dried them with her hair
[1:01:11] jesus turned to simon jesus
[1:01:14] and said simon i've got something to say
[1:01:16] to you
[1:01:19] he told simon
[1:01:21] how that all her sins which were many
[1:01:26] we're all forgiven
[1:01:29] simon still had his
[1:01:33] sitting in the seat of the
[1:01:35] scornful i don't
[1:01:51] brother banham said
[1:01:53] and today
[1:01:56] jesus is standing outside the door
[1:01:59] of a pentecostal organization
[1:02:04] baptist organization
[1:02:16] and people are passing
[1:02:59] we all have the same message the same
[1:03:02] bible
[1:03:04] and brother sister i know
[1:03:07] that we are beyond the age of pentecost
[1:03:13] i've got direct statements that tell us
[1:03:15] that
[1:03:17] we are in the bright age
[1:03:21] but brother sister just because
[1:03:26] we are beyond an age
[1:03:42] we're beyond the age of luther's message
[1:03:47] 400 years ago
[1:03:51] but we're not beyond justification
[1:03:56] we're beyond the denominational part
[1:04:00] not beyond the experience
[1:04:05] without justification
[1:04:08] none of us are saved
[1:04:24] justification
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:50] the next stage of grace
[1:05:06] he
[1:05:18] until you're clean
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:27] you find a glass in your yard
[1:05:33] in the dirty
[1:06:00] but you're not going to use it dirty
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:44] true christianity
[1:06:49] is not taking the bible
[1:06:53] as a book of rules
[1:06:57] that you try to live
[1:07:40] true christianity
[1:07:42] is accepting what christ did for you at
[1:07:45] calvary
[1:07:48] by faith
[1:07:50] accepting his pardon
[1:07:54] repenting
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:08:12] for the remission of sins
[1:08:15] and you shall receive what
[1:08:18] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:08:21] what is the holy ghost
[1:09:18] you're lost
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:32] one of the disciples
[1:09:34] in matthew 16.
[1:09:37] jesus asked his dis uh
[1:09:39] he presented a question to his disciples
[1:09:42] jesus
[1:09:44] he said who do men say i
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:10:14] had enough understanding of their bible
[1:10:17] to know
[1:10:19] what son of man meant
[1:10:21] son of man is a prophet
[1:10:28] not a
[1:10:42] son
[1:10:51] one of the prophets
[1:10:59] jesus turned to peter
[1:11:02] peter who do you say
[1:11:07] peter responded
[1:11:10] thou art the christ
[1:11:12] the son of the living god
[1:11:18] peter
[1:11:20] saw beyond the veil
[1:11:24] because christ came in the office of son
[1:11:27] of man
[1:11:30] came as a prophet
[1:11:34] that was promised by moses
[1:11:37] lord thy god shall raise up a prophet
[1:11:39] like and unto me
[1:11:44] the difference was
[1:11:46] this was god
[1:11:49] own
[1:11:50] physical body
[1:12:07] now notice jesus's response
[1:12:16] he said blessed art thou simon barjona
[1:12:20] um
[1:12:32] did not reveal this to you
[1:12:36] so he was blessed
[1:12:39] it wasn't pointed so much at what he
[1:12:41] said
[1:12:44] but who he received it from
[1:13:01] into our hearts because if a man talks
[1:13:05] you into this
[1:13:09] a man will talk you out of it
[1:13:13] but when christ the holy ghost
[1:13:16] reveals
[1:13:29] i will build my church
[1:13:44] praise
[1:13:57] because he could receive revelations
[1:14:12] yeah
[1:14:13] as predestinated seed
[1:14:17] was given the greatest of all
[1:14:18] revelations
[1:14:21] from god himself would you remember and
[1:14:24] then jesus says
[1:15:36] right amongst our own
[1:15:38] they've tried to convince some
[1:15:41] but the holy ghost is different
[1:15:45] yet it doesn't act the same way
[1:15:49] let's stay with our bibles
[1:15:52] let's stay with the message
[1:16:05] listen to this
[1:16:09] is this all right so far amen
[1:16:11] okay good right
[1:16:15] brother madam says
[1:16:18] i like to see a real pedigreed christian
[1:16:27] not packing his letters the methodists
[1:16:29] last week the baptist this week
[1:17:00] he's pedigreed pentecost
[1:17:06] this is what brother man says now
[1:17:09] i
[1:17:10] want to be pentecostal
[1:17:26] yes sir
[1:17:28] he preached the message
[1:17:31] just in case you didn't follow through
[1:17:33] and listen to the tape
[1:17:37] but he entitled the message
[1:17:40] why i am a holy roller
[1:17:53] so if my prophet
[1:17:55] was a holy roller is
[1:18:10] from the
[1:18:22] top of the head souls that don't matter
[1:18:24] how short how tall hey man
[1:18:36] now watch
[1:18:38] i don't mean denominational pentecost
[1:18:44] i mean the real power of the resurrected
[1:18:46] christ
[1:18:51] the real pentecostal
[1:19:04] that we
[1:19:06] are beyond pentecost
[1:19:10] absolutely we are
[1:19:13] absolutely this is the message brother
[1:19:14] madam preached
[1:19:17] two years after this message
[1:19:20] status
[1:19:35] is second peter chapter one
[1:19:42] it's to be
[1:19:44] partakers of the divine nature
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:14] so brother the first thing we have is
[1:20:16] faith
[1:20:18] and that faith takes us to matthew 16.
[1:20:24] who do men say i the son of man
[1:20:28] he builds his church
[1:20:45] here's what brother banh said what's
[1:20:47] this
[1:20:48] he said
[1:20:49] this is where you pentecostals
[1:20:53] made your mistake
[1:20:56] you were born in the family by the holy
[1:20:59] ghost
[1:21:02] but failed to listen to the tutor
[1:21:08] and go on
[1:21:10] and grow up
[1:21:12] alley
[1:21:26] it's just the beginning
[1:21:29] we are required in this age
[1:21:33] to come up to a token
[1:21:36] to a seal
[1:21:39] to an adoption
[1:22:08] questions
[1:22:22] not every born-again believer be saved
[1:22:28] but every born-again believer go in the
[1:22:30] wraps
[1:22:34] there's two saved groups
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:23:04] that word in that scripture
[1:23:09] means they all lived sanctified
[1:23:14] they were all believers
[1:23:17] they were all saved
[1:23:30] they're all virgins
[1:23:34] bible reads
[1:23:36] how that
[1:23:37] they went out to be remember okay the
[1:23:39] bible reads
[1:23:41] that they all slumbered and slept
[1:23:46] but then at midnight there came a
[1:23:48] bridegroom cry
[1:23:52] woke up all the virgins
[1:23:55] including the wise
[1:24:00] he said
[1:24:01] the bridegroom cry
[1:24:04] comes through malachi 4.
[1:24:07] that shows us
[1:24:10] there's both wise and foolish
[1:24:12] right here amongst ourselves
[1:24:28] that was elected
[1:24:42] that their lamp had gone out no longer
[1:24:44] did that in fact if you look at it
[1:24:48] you have a scofield bible
[1:24:51] in the margin
[1:24:53] going back to the original greek
[1:25:10] or going
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:18] absolutely
[1:25:20] both
[1:25:21] lamps
[1:25:22] were lit and burning
[1:25:35] they took an extra vessel
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:52] they asked brother branham
[1:25:55] well all born again believers go in the
[1:25:57] rapture
[1:26:00] he said no
[1:26:02] they won't all go
[1:26:05] because brother sister it takes
[1:26:31] each of these virtues in you
[1:26:59] glory
[1:27:03] this is blasphemous names
[1:27:07] and this message
[1:27:10] was preached
[1:27:12] the following month after statures of a
[1:27:14] perfect man
[1:27:27] he goes through all of these virtues
[1:27:58] he
[1:28:10] the day of the redemption of what
[1:28:39] none of them can be added
[1:29:09] he said that was what was the matter of
[1:29:10] branham tabernacle
[1:29:14] you try to take on the works of christ
[1:29:19] before you have the nature of christ
[1:29:36] he's bringing up his people
[1:29:40] he's bringing his people up
[1:29:43] you and i yeah
[1:29:45] the individual
[1:29:47] the gentiles not saved as a group
[1:29:50] saved as an
[1:30:04] but how do
[1:30:16] he says make your calling and election
[1:30:18] sure

[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] and know where you're standing
[1:30:40] and brother no matter where we are in
[1:30:43] our journey

[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:58] to come to the adoption of sons and
[1:33:01] daughters of god
[1:33:03] god didn't just predestinate us to be
[1:33:06] believers predestined us to be born
[1:33:09] again
[1:33:10] he predestines to a headstone to a seal
[1:33:15] to an adoption
[1:33:18] brother to the bride of christ
[1:33:34] to deceive

[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:42] that he's got to take care of
[1:41:46] if the new birth gave you all of those
[1:41:51] then why would you need to add them
[1:41:55] after you're born again
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:26] all
[1:42:40] that we need to give to christ
[1:42:52] okay i want to read this and then i'll
[1:42:53] close
[1:43:06] now i've got to add patience
[1:43:21] i said what
[1:43:25] i've come this far
[1:43:29] and i still ain't got the holy ghost
[1:43:32] brother he's not referring to your birth
[1:43:50] in order to be an heir in order to be
[1:43:52] adopted
[1:43:54] we've got to grow up
[1:43:57] through these virtues
[1:44:00] to the full stature of christ
[1:44:04] then he
[1:44:17] in this age
[1:44:32] that would tie up all the loose ends
[1:44:36] that would reveal the full mystery of
[1:44:39] god
[1:44:42] to whom much is given
[1:44:45] much is required
[1:44:59] i add godliness
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:14] into this into this
[1:45:17] into this
[1:45:18] into this
[1:45:20] into this
[1:45:21] and then the love of god
[1:45:24] christ comes down
[1:45:27] and seals that up in me
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:57] he births you and seals that into you
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:03] you see why the new birth is so
[1:46:05] important
[1:46:08] so see brother sister
[1:46:24] from
[1:46:50] have you ever met a
[1:47:07] so god had to take care of our temper
[1:47:10] first
[1:47:13] he said have patience with god
[1:47:17] have patience with one another
[1:47:34] he said how you answer back
[1:47:39] the bible says
[1:47:40] not
[1:47:42] when riled upon
[1:47:52] i've got a thumb pointing back at me
[1:47:58] so you see brother sister in the new
[1:48:00] birth
[1:48:01] put you in a position
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:31] myself
[1:48:32] is they blame their ancestors
[1:48:39] well my dad had temper
[1:48:42] my dad granddaddy had temper
[1:48:44] oh
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:59] no god's spirit can overcome
[1:49:02] whatever lays in your family
[1:49:06] this is a result of the natural birth
[1:49:09] this is the result of a supernatural
[1:49:25] he said from the sweetness of your heart
[1:49:29] forgiving every man
[1:49:33] if you've got temper
[1:49:35] you can't do that
[1:49:38] so god deals with that
[1:49:54] the bible says let not the sun go down
[1:49:56] upon your wrath
[1:50:04] it produces a root
[1:50:07] called bitterness
[1:50:10] and it will run the holy spirit out of
[1:50:12] your life
[1:50:15] forgiving
[1:50:18] everything
