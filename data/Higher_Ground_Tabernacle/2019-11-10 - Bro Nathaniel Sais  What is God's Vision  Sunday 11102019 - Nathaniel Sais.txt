expect them not to come you're in the age where they shall come you we claim to be the bride and the bride has been called to be tested and it's ride every test according to the Word of God is not pleasant but in all that we are tested and God expects us to overcome so we thank God for His grace yesterday we had a wonderful youth meeting I'm sorry but those who didn't make it or those who wasn't aware of it we try to make it everybody no we had a good turnout by God's grace our brother they then you'll really preached a wonderful message we have been blessed through his ministry thus far he ministered down in Iowa City Friday night ministered here yesterday and we had a lot of fellowship afterwards lunch was prepared for the young people and today we come to hear from God again our brother Nate Daniel for those of us who know brother Randy science that's its dad and you know when he came for the read he did come here we had a glorious and so therefore we appreciate our brother Nathanael for coming and we want to give him space to enjoy or to preach the Word of God now let me say it like this people of God you create the app the song leader can't do it by himself and you know you've got to come in here amen and forget about all your struggles and your trials and you leave all that behind and if you tired ask God for strength amen because when you pull on the Word of God God will definitely feed you and each and every one of us ought to be grateful that we have been called to this glorious pride amen who our brother come we're gonna sing one more song this is your last you know brother branham said it like this he said you know you might be able to sing hymns you may be the evidence sings sang songs he said but you must worship in spirit if you're gonna sing sing in the spirit if you're gonna pray pray in the spirit if you're gonna preach preach in the spirit if you're gonna testify testify in the spirit amen touch some soul amen as you give your saw itself to God amen I will [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well you did come up a few notches [Music] we don't have our brother come down get some real money I really need that you will come and speak to us I like a great heart and self that's the way I don't like lukewarm service I like a green hot that's right [Music] you mean you know one of the ways we would catch a little bit of wind when we get some altitude you know when God gives us him for inspiration you know what we do we start hunting down the devil where's the devil at because only that Devils gonna start getting upset he's gonna start fighting you and some aspect of your life something maybe that happens some spirit that might be here when the spirit begins to lift us up we want to just start discerning where that those spirits are at our brother Keith already prayed here a little bit ago to bind every spirit I appreciated that prayer you know those prayers are not in vain this isn't just flowery words it's not saying something nice things are done for purpose win it and when a child of God when a son or daughter of God prays a prayer of faith things begin to move things begin to change that's why we're here today that the words that have been spoken not just here today but the words that God has spoken would be seen here today in our lives but also as we go from here today we want to go from here with something that will give us power to overcome tomorrow and what about the next day and the next day and what about when God calls for us that trumpet sounds in and he says all of my children who prepare themselves who will be ready for that moment today is the day to get ready today is the day to hunt down where the devil is trying to hide and say devil today is the day of deliverance because God has brought his word to me and I don't have to be subject to you amen praise the Lord thank you musicians appreciate the the sacrifice of them playing this morning let's turn in your Bibles if you have your Bibles with you let's turn to proverbs 29 praise the Lord we've been by God's grace we've been speaking in the last couple days and just kind of laying a foundation as continuing on the work that brother brother Brooks has been doing you see power from God comes by knowing God's Word because God does not bless those things that are not of his word now you can get into what what you may be familiar with this term maybe or not and that's okay if you're not but there is God's perfect will and there is God's permissive will now when you're when you're you tell your child son or daughter do this and they do it 90 percent they do it 75 percent they do sort of do what you've told them to do you say well okay next time let's do this it'll happen sometimes and God gives us instructions we kind of want to do we want to do what God told us but we want to do with our flavor we want to do it in the way that we want to do it and God says well bless that as much as it is my word but there's a part in there that I can't bless and there's tons when we go through life and we we hit a wall and we hit a wall I got this I'm praying and I believe I have faith and I don't feel like things are moving but when it's God's Word things must move so what is what is the challenge to us we have to dig in and see Lord if you speak it must be and if it is not what I believe it should be something's wrong is there some sin over here this is some sin over here do i misunderstand the Word of God because I might be standing on something Lord said stand over here and I'm standing over here and God said until you get over there I can't bless you so we want to by God's grace we're going to look at a little subject we're gonna take a text here in Proverbs and we're gonna look at a little subject today what is God's vision what is God's vision because we apply our own vision to what God has told us I want to do what I want to do go ahead I pray that you bless what I want to do and God doesn't want what you want dad wants you to know his desire and lift his desire and if you live his desire how can God not stand with you and then the demons in Hell when you wake up in the morning and put your foot down father awake again every devil in hell brothers had an exaggeration that is not an exaggeration two hundred thousand thousand demons can be at your door no thank you today is a day of salvation and God gave me strength to overcome every demon what brother I'm just a little nobody you are but Jesus Christ is somebody and if Jesus Christ is in you he is there somebody he is their power he is the only name that all power was given to you the devil thought he had power and God came and took the power that Satan thought he had so when Satan tells you as power you can say no you don't brother do I have to yell the way you're yelling right now no you don't you can have a quiet humble prayer Lord Jesus you gave me your word and I want to stand on your word Lord you have the victory it's your word it's your victory it's your vision I want to live your vision and watch what God will do in situations like that now let us read here so I can have you be seated here in a moment proverbs 29 proverbs 29 verse 17 to 21 we'll just read these few verses and then it will have you be seated verse number 17 correct thy son and he shall give the rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he a servant will not be corrected by words for though he understood understand he will not answer see us yes also verse number 20 and 21 see us now a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope of a fool than of him now let's read this carefully he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at length may God bless the reading of the word you may be seated when I read this this morning I was for this this scripture came to mind where there is no vision the people perish and I was reading it fits so perfectly these verses that we just read fit so perfectly with what the Lord had laid upon my heart and I love as it says here the one that will delicately raise their children delicately so many times we can be heavy-handed with our children but it says here that if one will raise a servant correctly that they will raise up and they will become a son why because they've been treated as a son they've been taught as a son so let's just unfold this we were talking yesterday about unfolding so let's unfold this little scripture here just a little bit they had servants in the Old Testament but here we are a New Testament what does it have to do with us so let's apply this to the scripture and the New Testament and apply it to us the servant is one that is under law we are born in this world by law by God's law of natural reproduction here we are born in this world and we are under law of sin and death because we are in sin we will die but if we are raised correctly if God's Word comes to us and we accept that word though the Bible tells us that at length that means there might be a little season but as the word has come it begins to do something in that soul and the one that is under law becomes a son a son is not by law a son is by grace a son is like the father and as we are growing up in the Lord there are times when we feel like well it's just a bunch of rules how can I possibly do everything that God told me to do but if we can look at the word then the right way and apply it to us those that are servants are I just have there's just rules and and everything that God says just a bunch of rules and it's laws and laws you're thinking as a servant God doesn't want you to be a servant God wants you to be a son or daughter of the Living God and it even says I believe it was Paul said in the New Testament he said you are no longer a servant you are more than a servant you are a son you are all a daughter if you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and accepted the work that God wants to do in your life you are no longer a servant we're not held by the law were held by grace Paul said I am a prisoner of Christ why he was a prisoner by love not because a god was forcing him but because something in his heart was holding him was binding him in a good way in a positive way something that was holding him well I don't know if I can be a Christian tomorrow don't worry about it friend that which is in you if God gives you his Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost that will keep you you can't keep yourself but don t keep do because if do his word and you fall that makes God a liar did you catch that if God's Word is in you and you fall it makes God a liar and God cannot lie mmm-hmm praise the Lord where there is no vision the people perish and the sub that we're going to take from these scriptures here our little text this morning and maybe by God's graces to be encouraging to you what is God's vision because we don't want our vision anymore we've already tried our anybody tried their whole vision and saw how it didn't work and you raise your hands and say that I've tried my vision I failed I failed on so many things in life of this and big things and small things because I had my ideas and and friends let me tell you you might say to me today brother brother but I'm sincere I was sincere - I was sincerely wrong brother Branham said many people accused him of being wrong but they even his testimony was known he wasn't dishonest people just believed that he thought wrong and that's true whenever every son and daughter of God if the world around you isn't looking at you like you're a little bit different something's wrong Ruth left everything that she had and she left it all and went and followed the army she was a little different and bad calls you out of where you're at to serve Him to follow him to be a little different but when you take a step on God's Word and you stand there in faith remember it's God's Word that key is bound to and if you were lost in his word he can't forsake you and he's not a liar therefore you cannot have anything but victory praise the Lord now remember without a vision the people perish let's go to Matthew 2/6 chapter everyone doing all right this morning praise the Lord praise the Lord here in Matthew 6 chapter but I just love the grace of God he is so good to us let me I mean friends if you feel if you feel down remember it's not the feeling that is your evidence the evidence is God's Word and God's Word never fails why is that important brother well I like to feel good I like to feel good too don't we don't like to feel who likes to feel bad nobody likes to feel bad but when you do when you do feel bad is God's Word still true hey man so if we're in the middle of a trial we're down in the valley you know what there's something so strange about a child of God because they can walk in the valley and people are looking at them like you should be down there's something your life is just falling apart how is it that you you have a joy that you still have a smile on your face because my God said he he has delivered not that he will deliver he has already delivered so I can walk through the valley of the shadow of death and the devil says but I'm gonna put death on you I'm gonna put this on you I'm gonna put financial ruin on you I'm gonna put this I'm gonna put character I'm gonna put ulcers I'm gonna put all kinds of things on you and you can say I'm already delivered but brother you don't feel it it's not based on feeling it's based on God's Word and if we can just have a vision of that of God's Word death hell and the grave doesn't have a chance let alone some Devils that come to you and try to try to convince you well you're not a son or daughter of God mm-hmm God told me how do you know that God loves you we have a precious little sermon called a deep call of to the deep how do you know that God loves you do you want God do you want more of God that is the evidence of God's love my brother I don't feel like he loves me do you want God yes Amen brother I want God do you desire more of God yes but I desire more of God that is the evidence because remember the ocean was made and then the fish was made to swim in the ocean first there was the ocean first there was a God then there was a creation it was made to love and desire that God my so many good things there but let's move on Matthew 6 Matthew 6 let's read verse 21 to 23 Matthew 6 21 to 23 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light verse number 23 but if thy eye be evil the whole body is full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness if your eye be single maybe you get a picture in your head when I first read that scripture of you know they call it a cyclops of this creature has got one eye in the middle that's not what that means what that means is if your eyes are fixed on one thing and if that thing is the right thing then the light will fill the whole body not just this body but the whole body if there is no vision the people perish if there is the eye is not fixed on the right thing the body is full of darkness but if we have our fixed on the right thing the Bible tells us that a whole body will be full of light so if we can make sure today as we are here today we've got a little bit of time together well brother you might preach for a long time you know yesterday I was so grateful to the children they were very patient with me we weren't much longer than I would like to preach to little children but there were some things important I believe that well my heart it was important to come out and I believe that came out as God intended I was feeling overwhelmed at the end of yesterday I was feeling overwhelmed God your word is so big how could I ever express it all you know that God's Word can't all be expressed from behind this pulpit did you know that because the only way that God's Word can be expressed is if you live their life the word the Living Word of God who is Jesus Christ what we want to wear brother I want to watch somehow you know there is and forgive me for hitting this in this way but it's the truth you know friends people came out of denominational churches and say praise God there's one God and we got the word and we got Jesus Christ that's denominational thinking we got the word over here we got Jesus Christ over here they're the same thing God's Word is himself and that's what he's trying to express today if you can have the vision of God that is Jesus that is Jehovah Savior The Anointed One that's who God is so the name of the word is Jesus Christ that's who he is that word has come to you and we were demonstrating yesterday a message in a piece of paper and as the people piece of paper was given unto us through the Prophet now we have the paper and it's supposed to unfold in our lives here we are for those of you that know there's a three-fold purpose of God and we took that as a very simple example it was a piece of paper that was folded three times and you unfolded and you see this God above you unfold it again and you see that God came down to BRE demson to us to be our Savior but you were folded again and he says now I want to be one with you I want you to be me I want to be you you be me to shall be one flesh think about that friend - shall be one flesh why the very God of heaven wants to dwell in you and express himself in you praise the Lord we saw on Friday we saw that God made Adam in His image and he gave Adam responsibility oh my but friends until Adam at Concord desert the serpent he was now fully in the image of God because of something had been in heaven Lucifer had been in heaven and what happened in heaven what happened in heaven God said Lucifer that's enough get up he conquer Lucifer and when Adam was made leader over the earth where was the serpent in the earth here is now Adam is made ruler over the serpent but God knew that to be in his perfect image Adam and the race of Adam had to overcome the serpent why are we here today why are we all sitting in this room right now because God has drawn us something has tugged at our hearts the evidence of God's love and we sit here today because God is still unfolding his plan because man is not in the image of God until we the bride of Jesus Christ have conquered the devil in every way in every facet and every piece that can be conquer in your life in your everyday life God wants to conquer the devil in your life if you give you a lot to God what will happen the exact same thing that happened in heaven well I got this devil I got this devil give your life to God and watch what God will do he will cast out the devil of your life and in it God is being expressed because God is the conqueror of Satan that's who God is the Savior to hold the Savior came down but he didn't just come down he wanted to be in I will be with you even in you today is the day of salvation today is the day that God is made praise the Lord but what does it look like friend what is victory when God begins to move in our lives what is it what what does victory look like the world has many misconceptions about what victory looks like the world has chased after riches the Catholic Church chased after wealth and power gold overlaid they got together and they talked about it and they agreed and they said this is what victory looks like but you know when God sent a man in this day I'll be talking with brother Isaiah about this how this got out of proportion how many people have looked at the prophet and made the prophet God he was part of deliverance but he was not the deliveries you are part of deliverance but you are not the deliverance you are God's people and God's people are deliverance it's good in you and that's how he wants to conquer the devil the first he fell but the second will not praise the Lord what a promise to us that second he will not fall praise the Lord right down to the last death hell and the grave is going to be holding on oh I think we can still hold it I think we can still hold a victory but that bride just keeps slipping away slipping away and the devil comes back and he's holding on to you he's on your pant leg get off of me devil get off of me because God gave him a victory death trying to hold on maybe you're sick today that's trying to hold on to you but Jesus already took the keys of death hell and the grave what is the vision complete and utter victory complete in every part every part praise the Lord Jesus it's this is why yesterday I felt so overwhelmed the message is so good the message is so pure it's so today it's so alive right now the message is alive praise the Lord you forgive me I gotta take my coat off praise the Lord thank you brother complete and utter victory now you remember you are not the victory God is the victory in you it's Jesus Christ in you that is the victory it is not to lose or lift yourself up it is now for me to lift myself up but what happens when we get things in order God begins to speak to you he begins to minister to your heart and he says do you know who you are let me express myself to you because if you know who I am then you know who you are because you are part of me when God looked at the body of Jesus he saw male and female the body the body brother yes sir we were represented there and if we identify with his death we can identify with the resurrection that same resurrection that was in the first church age the second the third they received the love of the truth then it had the full revelation of God's truth but they have the love of the truth they loved it unto death they were they died they were martyred they were killed for it and here today God knew it was going to be the darkest of the darkest ages and he said in a darkest stage I'm gonna send the greatest light and that light is to be in you it is supposed to be God in you overcoming the devil praise the Lord my God is good here in Matthew 6 Matthew 6 we read for where your treasure is there your heart will be also the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single if that vision is right the whole body will be full of light you know the Bible also says the next verse that we read earlier it says that if your vision is wrong then it's full of darkness but let's just focus on God gave us a vision right we can spend our time understanding the wrong vision well I don't want to be that you can spend a lifetime doing that and never understand what the real vision is you can spend all your time studying well not studying I want to if you're the way I say that studying sometimes relates to a preacher we we use the word studying really we just want to spend time with God and get God's word so we can stand here and preach the pure Word of God but then what I'm trying to express is it's true for everybody if you spend your time what I don't want to do that and I don't want to do this and I don't want to do that and I don't want to do this what you're saying is I don't want to transgress the law but didn't we read that the servant can become a son and if a servant becomes a son the law is of no more effect and if we can understand what is right then we can walk by the grace of the Living God and power from God Himself will be in us and that power will overcome it is now us overcoming it is God overcoming do us that's his desire God could just say it's done but God wants those words to come from your lips brother how can I ever be there how could it ever be so in tune with God the answer is in your own efforts that you cannot just like you cannot save yourself Jesus Christ is the only one that can save you and it's the power of God who is Jesus Christ in you that will set everything right so what is the challenge that we submit ourselves unto God and allow him to do the world if we can just humble ourselves if we can be more sincere all god I'm so tired of messing up Lord you know that repentance is not saying I'm sorry did you know that many people think that well you know I can live like the devil but if I come and repent on Sunday that I'm okay that's a hypocrite that's not a son or daughter of God a son or daughter of God wants to know instruction the Bible says we read that in Proverbs that a son that will accept instruction is a good thing but a son that won't accept or a servant that won't accept instruction it's just it's destruction but if we will accept the Word of God so many people to come to church Oh Lord forgive me I did this this week they got their lists just like during a Catholic Church well I did this this week and I did this this week and I did this this week you know if you're a son of God you still repair do you know that you still want that but Paul said I strive daily I exercise myself daily that there is nothing between God and I but you're not coming just to say Lord I'm sorry a broken in the contrite heart is good but it doesn't mean you're gonna fall away it doesn't mean that God's gonna cast you away and if you've been struggling with that that will open a door for a demon of depression to come into your life but you remember that it's not your effort it is the complete work of Jesus Christ that delivered you and it's not a feeling it's a done work and if our vision is right then we understand that God did that work but if we have something in our life that is not a baaad well Lord just changed my life give me instruction and I will take it repentance is not saying I'm sorry repentance is if you're going this way and you repent it means I'm gonna stop turn around and go the other way it's not saying I'm sorry I've broken in the contract heart is a good thing in the right place if it's genuine eyes genuinely sin before God God I don't want sin in my life Lord forgive me but also give me strength that I don't do it again our overcoming power which we love the blood of Jesus Christ but the story didn't end there he died and went to hell he got victory he rose again and gave the victory to the Saints it's their victory that we want today is that victory that we want to be in us the power from on high praise the Lord you know that Jesus Jesus told the disciples go tarry in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you know that Jerusalem means the city of peace dwell in peace until you be endued with power well brother I've been praying for the Baptist of the Holy Ghost I want a new birth in my life the evidence that God wants to give it to you is that desire and if you had the desire then dwell in peace and wait until you be endued with power from on high if it worked in the book of Acts it will work today dwell in the city of peace praise the Lord Abraham meant the king of that city and you know Abraham spent the rest of his life looking for that city where is that sea I met the king Abraham it doesn't exist yes it does I met him and if there's a king of the city and he was real I had communion with him I talked with him if he's real I've got to find him let's go to Hebrews 11 will take up right on that thought Hebrews 11 hey man praise the Lord 11 Hebrews 11 let's read verses 32 to 40 once again as hebrews 11:32 to 40 now this is now Paul he's explaining to the Jews just for a moment this book of Hebrews sometimes it's good it's always good and we understand the context see sometimes you can read a book in a Bible and you don't understand it and sometimes it's because we don't understand where it fits this is Paul explaining to the Jews the connection the book of Hebrews is Paul explaining to the Jews the connection the bridge from the Old Testament he's proving to them by scripture that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new that's what the book of Hebrews is now as he begins to explain here hebrews 11:32 and 40 he's just been talking about the Old Testament Old Testament Saints just like we were talking about Abraham right so here we go and Hebrews 11 verse number 32 now what more shall what excuse me and what shall I I'm more say for the time would fail me to tell you of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jephta and of David and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned the flight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain better resurrection and others had trials of cruel mocking and scourge scourging 's yerry moreover with bonds and imprisonment they were stoned and they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword this is your brothers and sisters is talking about this is your brothers and sisters this isn't just some history this is your brothers and sisters that's strong for the same gospel that you walk today well brother they were in the old test but they received the love of the truth there wasn't there their responsibility on the day that they were living in they accepted the Christ that delivers for their day and when they did they were abused they were killed they were torn in half for it those are your brothers and sisters verse number 36 and others had trial of cruel mocking and scourging yea moreover a bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered around as sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise received not the promise brother let's read carefully receive not the promise verse number 40 God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect but I thought it was just about me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me that is the human condition it's all about me me me me me me me but God withheld the promise from them because of you they were tormented they were sawn asunder they were torn apart and God said the time to receive the promise is not yet because your brothers and sisters still to come and as we sit here today we read the Bible yes brother we've read those verses again friends I'm not trying to rebuke you I'm trying to bring your attention to the fact that this is so real it's so if we can catch a vision of what this means it begins to mean something to us there are those that died they went through suffering they went through pain and they did not receive the promise because of you because God had a vision God had a vision and the vision wasn't complete because you were born you weren't there so they were withheld from the promise but they accepted the promise seeing it afar off they only had a little piece you remember I can't see it right here you see a shadow you can you see that shadow that's a vague shadow that's what they had in the Old Testament but they saw the shadow and they accepted it how much more when the shadow has become the hand when God has come to dwell in flesh how much more we look at it sometimes we say oh my that's nice the shadow has become the living body of God and they just had a shadow they accepted it and died and gave their lives for how much more should we have the conviction that burns in us Oh God it's worth giving up my life God may not be asking you to be torn apart in the physical God may not be to be asking you to have the sufferings in your flesh but all of those things that the Old Testament Saints had that is asking you to overcome them in the spirit they had it in the natural and all of the natural takes the spiritual so here we are today and God is trying to rip your homes apart that's the devil's trying to rip you apart he's trying to rip the church apart he's trying to rip the Assemblies apart he's trying to rip the body apart trying to be ripped asunder the devil wants to pull this way the devil wants to pull this way what will we do will we stand like them will we stand like them there comes the Lions for punishment all these these Christians and in the first couple of church ages you don't know that church history Roman the the political Roman Empire had a stronghold on Jerusalem had a stronghold on Judea and they had a political rule and they could kill anybody they wanted and when they hated the Jews they really hated the Jews and they would just feed them to the Lions for entertainment they didn't go to the movies they want to see a Christian get eaten by lion you know I'm gonna say it this way you know a child of God going to the movies is just like that because that old devil the lion is running around seeing who can he can devour and it would run right into his mouth yes devour me well that might be a little bit harsh but it's still the truth you are what you feed on and if your feeder what the devil has what are you going to be we were talking about on Friday a sheep when they eat they don't do this I'll have any wool yet I gotta push some more I need some wool I'm straining I'm struggling to push out some wool they just eat and if you eat what the devil feeds you what do you produce what to devil fed you well brother I don't really know how I don't have victory in my life and the devil's done this and the devil's done that where's the devil there's a stink over here I can't put my finger on it my god you know what it is God you reveal it because if I don't have victory it's because something's wrong you're not a liar God is not a liar his word is absolute and if I don't have victory I need to sniff it out some stinks over here what is this oh I got this CD I thought this CD was okay something doesn't feel right you don't need somebody to sit down with you and explain what's wrong the Bible says that the Spirit of God will lead you in all truth in righteousness but you know so-and-so does it so-and-so has this and so and so does that God didn't call you to fall so Apollo soul and soul God called you to follow the spirit of the Living God and if you follow his spirit that spirit wolf will lead you in your life you know I've done this thing my whole life and I didn't think it was offense to God but something's just pricking me in my heart I challenge you saints of God go home and if you can find something like that get rid of it I know a man that got rid of his TV on the next week his heart his daughter gave her heart to the Lord is that worth it that's worth it why because you're giving up give up what the devil has and God did that man now has three daughters that are serving the Lord because he gave something up you know a brother I can't even explain it just didn't brother I'm not a preacher I can't I'm not good with words God didn't say you had to be good with words he just said follow his spirit he didn't say you had to explain it just follow his spirit and God will do all those things I say that because sometimes as we preach and I know I move quickly and it's because time is short sometimes we try to cover some ground or trying to move quickly damn brother you're just talking so fast I just can't catch all of it that's okay because I pray that by the grace of God the words that are being spoken today are more than words Jesus said my words are spirit and if the Spirit of Truth has come that he will he will lead you I can't lead you but their books can't lead you it's got to be the Spirit of God as we said on Friday brother Brooks and Albert says a fellowship in Alejo we just appreciate this thought you aren't are you are a brother books is people this isn't brother Brooks at church this is God's church this is God's pulpit this is God's Word and you are God's treasure God treasures you know brother you're preaching so hard and I you know I got this wrong and I got this wrong do you we just read in Psalms that if a good son or good daughter will take the correction and apply and if you apply it friends there is deliverance to be had brother I come on Sunday and I've repented of that did you or did you say you were sorry Paul brother I came for prayer and brother Brooks laid his hands on me and praise God God forgave me he did it because God is a merciful God but did you change direction did you go home and do the thing did you go home and follow the instruction well brother I didn't feel spiritually led to do that now we got things mixed up we think that the the leading of the Spirit is a feeling it's not a feeling when God preaches he sends a man of God to preach the gospel you hear the word Amen that's the truth make a note I need to go home and do such-and-such brother but I don't feel that God isn't asking you to feel it he's asking you to follow his word that's all if you want to be a victory just follow the word this is complete victory to the believer absolute complete entire for I can't emphasize that to you enough this will smash the devil to bits in your life what is God's vision God's vision is deliverance his people to conquer you know when Esther came before the king she kept the first time she was fasting and she was praying oh you know I might die if I die I die the first time she came before the king before the king the Bible says the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the beginning of wisdom you are aware that God is above all a man but that wasn't the last of the unfolding Esther came again and this time she was a little more bold because she had the last experience now it wasn't just because the the King said you know Esther whatever you want you want half the kingdom I'll give it to you now she had remembered my brother pray to begin brother the Spirit of God was blessing me in the back when you were praying that dot well you know brother Keith was it shouting it's not about shouting we might shout we might talk quietly it's about the truth the spirit of truth when the spirit of truth it but brother I don't feel it I feel down if you're a child of God I don't feel sorry for you well brothers because your life is so easy well if you want to trade some time let me know because no child of God has it easy as brother Brooks was saying no child of God has it easy why because God wants you in his image how can you be in his image unless you conquer the devil how can you conquer the devil unless the devil comes against you I appreciated that and our brother said that he was talking about the heat is I don't believe he said it directly I just was talking about the statute of perfect man he's praying about the statute of a perfect man add to your faith add to your faith knowledge or I'm sorry I had your faith virtue add to your virtue of knowledge and this knowledge brother Branham explains what this knowledge is this knowledge is gnat because I read every every line of the Bible and I memorized at all that's not what this knowledge is and it's not because I have this I could quote all the clothes of brother brand have said that's also not what the knowledge is knowledge is that you have seen the water the gods word had to your your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge you have faith praise God you have faith but not your faith need to be strengthened you need to grow in strength and as you grow in strength now you get knowledge well how do you get knowledge because your faith begins to work faith is the unseen when your faith is made manifest it's no longer faith it's knowledge I'm not I'm not thinking of what's going to happen I'm now you know faith is a vision did you know that faith is a vision of what hasn't been manifested yet but faith already knows it and when faith is strengthened it becomes virtue and with virtue as manifested it becomes knowledge and Esther was growing in knowledge because she came before the king and then she came before the king she was trembling what if what if he doesn't want me she didn't know who she was she came in before the king and the king is can you imagine the Kings been busy that day he has to make rulings and he has to lead the kingdom and he's he's I say it like this the first thing that the King says or they what the King answers he lets his heart go right away I'll give you half of the kingdom you see that I'll give you how I want you to rule with me that's God's intent from the beginning that will be with God to minister to God God ministers up minister to God by you submitting your life to God you were ministering to you that's a wonderful thought we're gonna leave it like that for right now but that's a wonderful thought so here is Esther she's come before the king and and the first time she comes she's trembling the next time she comes in she says King would you come home and I prepared a banquet for you would you come in and have basically have dinner have a banquet she invites the king home with her hey man God is not just for church on Sunday Esther invited the King so then she comes the next time she's a little bolder cuz now she has knowledge you know the King does really love me Esther wasn't with the King every day did you know that she didn't get to see the King every day that's why she was afraid she had not been called the Bible I believe the Bible even says I haven't been called since and she lists at the time that it's been said she's been called but who and she comes before the King the second time she's a little bit more and you know the third time she comes now she just she doesn't just walk in flippantly but she walks in more confidently she walks in more Here I am again and the King asked her and the King never gets tired of seeing her Esther oh my queen I just don't get tired of seeing you're so beautiful now that that doesn't really register for us as men as much but you know that God is speaking to you to what God is saying is that you are getting fit for your purpose as you are growing in confidence and learning in the Lord and growing up this is kind of the terms that we men more associate with we are being fit for our purpose we're useful in the eyes of God hey man now our sisters might might associate more with yes that God says I'm beautiful yes thatís resonates with our sisters but us man beautiful wait I wouldn't say beautiful may be handsome may be rugged may be strong you know but beautiful what God is saying is that he is pleased with Esther and God is pleased with you if you follow his vision so Esther now comes in and she comes in you know what she's had this whole time in her heart was there was someone that was attacking her and was trying to destroy her people has anybody you ever had the devil attack your family you ever had the devil attack your home just follow Esther's example Lord I want you to come home with me well brother that's really simple yeah just invite the Lord to come home with you and she does that and the third time she says this wicked Haman this man this great he's become a great man of the kingdom you know hey man thought he was gonna get a promotion that day he thought he was just he was in good with the King it was it good with Esther here he is sitting at a banquet yeah this is good all that wine is good oh I'm living the good life here I am The Queen is here Esther's right here this beautiful Queen and I almost got these Jews lined up where I can destroy them I've almost got them lined up and Hema is just sitting there with a smile on his face I'm right where I want to be everything's just laid out the way I want to be and then Esther just says King this wicked Haman can you imagine Amos in there huh what's going on when you start to call out on the name of the Lord you know the devil says hey what's going on now now the devil's not privy the devil doesn't know all your communication with God that's secret that's between you and God do you know that if you're sitting there today and something just rings in your heart and you say hey man you know the devil doesn't know what you're a Manning okay here's the words but he doesn't have the revelation that only comes from the father there's a secret communication going on and here Haman says huh what what did I do and Esther says this wicked Haman wants to destroy my people what do you mean your people Haman didn't know she was a Jew and here he's just thinks he's in good with the king and queen I'm getting a promotion things are good this is a good dinner the wine is good oh I'm happy oh this is good I've got this Gallo's over here I'm gonna hang that that Mordechai that won't bow before me you know Saints when you won't bow before the devil it makes him really angry when you won't do what the devil was it makes him upset he doesn't like it don't be afraid of him don't be scared of the devil that dare will you know how they say this about they even like bears and and things in the wilderness I don't want to try this out but this is what they say they say that the Bears are more afraid of you than you are of them I don't know if that's true or not but I do know that the devil is more afraid of you than you are of him but you know sometimes I get so afraid he's more afraid than you have ever been let me I just gotta give you one more example of that here's Peter walking after the day of Pentecost he comes to a man he's at the gate and here comes Peter this man is laying on the ground he says the man says you know do you have some money can I have some money and and Peter says Flett a silver and gold have I none I don't have any money but I do have something and that which I have I'll give unto you can you imagine the devil can you imagine Haman sitting there P Peter what do you get a do you have that kind of power Jesus had that power but what how did it how'd that man get up and walk Peter you don't have that I thought you didn't had that power how is it that this man that was lame he's now walking Peter I didn't know you had that power Esther I didn't know you had that power children of the Living God the devil doesn't know the power of God that dwells in you and he all he knows is every time he's met a child of God he's lost every time well you know but brother some people you know they died in there sleeping in the ground yep but the devil didn't win he might think he might even have the idea that he won but he could he can read the Bible even though he doesn't know what its gonna look like he doesn't know how it's gonna happen but he knows that the Bible says that those that are dead in Christ shall rise again you don't have to be afraid of the devil here's their look at that Peter the dead would you imagine a devil look at that Peter what in the what is this can you imagine Haman looking at Mordecai I'm sorry looking at Esther what what what what do you mean your people here ham has been trying to do all this work behind the scenes trying to hide it from the king he doesn't know what he's walking into a trap what does the King do for Esther he says Esther what do you need this Haman Haman go hang him on his own gallows Esther what else do you need that Esther tell me what you need well King I need this I need this okay okay but you know what Esther this is just my real representation of that Esther here's a check you go sign it I've already so excuse me I've already signed it but it's blank you say what you want to happen and I will stand with you what do you want to happen the King already signed the check here he's giving you a blank check you know brother brother banner said the Pentecostals have money in the bank but they don't know how to write the check and then the legalists on the other side they know how to write the check they don't have any money in the bank God's children he wants him to have it all he wants it to be like Esther Esther here's a blank check whatever you need King what I want is deliverance for my people it's yours you speak it you want deliverance in your home you want deliverance in the phasic maybe you've struggled with for years God's giving you a blank check if we'll learn how to write the check we can draw on the money in the bank brother I don't know how to have money in the bank is this simple god I can't do anything well how is there having money in the bank because when you realize that you can't do anything it makes you look to the one that can and you realize that you're drawing on the Kings bank account the one that created all things if you need something else God can create it brother I don't know if God would do that for you God will do that for you if you ask you have not because you asked you just ask God pull on the Lord fill out the check praise the Lord I did not expect to go that direction today but let's continue on when you have God well this is what we're talking about today God's vision all of this is related to that when God is in his right place I've heard that Jesus Christ is God like we're talking about the beginning of service the word is Jesus Christ that's who he is the Lord Jesus Christ that's who the word is we're told when we talk about the word we're talking about the Lord Jesus Christ that's who he is so when we start to have God in order when we start to have God in order in the assembly the local assembly this is for us here today amen friends we're all here shoulder to shoulder not one about the other we're all here shoulder to shoulder to pull together so as we're here striving struggling to press forward a little bit more in Jesus Christ if we can understand how Jesus Christ fits into the church if he is placed correctly in the church he will then place you correctly in the church and when your place correctly in the church he will place you correctly in your home he will place you correctly in your marriage he will place you correctly in your job not all that it just starts with Jesus Christ being in the right place if you're in Jesus is in the right place because if you know where he's supposed to be at you know who he is Lord I can't do anything he says that's right but I can and I will do it through you so lay down yup so now he's in the right place now Lord now let's continue with our thought here Hebrews 11 I think we turn to Hebrews 11 and we did not read yet so let's read Hebrews 11 and 32 we're trying to move a little quick more quickly here we did read here in he was 11 they without us are not complete is what we were talking about the Saints from the Old Testament now let's let's turn to first Thessalonians everyone doing okay today praise the Lord if anybody's tired that's okay I understand that just shake it off a little bit we want to keep pressing on and make sure we get what God has for us we all get tired sometimes and sometimes the spirit of sleepiness comes on us and you know our body we're trying to fight our bodies but God quickened Sampson you know that Sampson wasn't a big man you know that and he picked up the gates of the enemy and walked right up in the hill if God can do that he'd give us strength to get to a church service don't you think amen we don't have to wait till we get home to start filling out think of the check let's fill it out deposit Lord I need to draw on that account right now I'll need a little bit of strength God give me strength ought to do it wait wind uh I brother plated beginning a service I was there and strength what's coming to me in the back I'm not trying to be super spiritual I'm just telling you the truth that's what happened went up when the saints of God pray things take place would you begin to draw on the account God says yeah you're not going to overdraw he's not going to bounce his account it's unlimited if we could just understand that the power of God is unlimited there is no limit to the power of God and God wants that power to be in your heart 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 first Thessalonians 4 we're gonna I'm gonna try to very quickly here just read verses 1 through 7 first that's it daesil onehans for 1 to 7 furthermore then we beseech you brethren exhort you by the lord jesus that you have received of us how you ought to walk in to please God so you would abound more and more so what does it take to abound you have received from us how you ought to walk so that you might abound that means increase and if you're not walking right you won't abound it's that simple verse number 2 for you know that what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will goes right to the will of God for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor but that's whose vessel let's bring this down real simple husbands and wives can you possess as a husband can I possess the the vessel of my wife no she's my wife it's very personal I love my wife very very much very dearly I want to be able to do everything I can for my wife but I cannot possess the vessel of my wife the Bible says possess your vessel well what happens when you possess your vessel Amen think about that one for a second if you possess your vessel and you be a child of God what happens to the environment around you the environment around you begins to change if you possess you want to affect somebody else you want to do good for somebody else you want to encourage somebody else you want to strengthen somebody else you possess your vessel you consecrate yourself you yourself in order don't say well you know so-and-so you know brother Nathaniel's preaching and that's for so-and-so you know so uh so needs to dedicate their life really what about your life because if you dedicate your life you watch the people around you begin to strengthen begin to increase in God if you possess your vessel not your neighbors yours verse number five not unless of concupiscence that's desires of the world even as the Gentiles which know not gone that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner he just said possess your vessel and he says if you go beyond that you defraud your brother hmm the fraud means you stole how can you steal from your brother or your sister how can you steal from them just by not possessing your vessel we'll see because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such that's not a good thing to be in that place as we have forewarned you and testified for God hath not called us an unclean cleanliness but in the holiness let's roll right along to verse number 15 now this is now looking back to what we were reading in Hebrews remember in Hebrews we're talking about the Old Testament Saints this is now referring right back to that verse number 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from the heaven with a shout that's number one number two with the voice of the Archangel number three with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we for we ever be with the Lord let's back up to verse number 15 let's read verse number 15 again for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep which sleep hmm you prevent them but you without them or not them without you or not complete we are called up together to meet him in the air something's got to happen we can't prevent them we cannot be ready prevent them the Word of God says that we cannot prevent them but they without us are not complete the body it witness is saying here the body must be complete as a body not as random individuals enter just do whatever they want as a body we must be complete how can we be complete how can I encourage one another how can i strengthen my brother how can i strengthen my home lord I just don't know what to do I don't know how I could just make a difference you know I try so hard but I can't make a difference you know maybe this God doesn't love me do you want more of God that's the evidence of God's love you want to make a difference possess your vessel repentance is not saying I'm sorry it's about changing direction it's about taking God's Word and applying it to your life possess your vessel and if you possess your vessel what's the things around you change brother I just I don't I don't know I don't know if that's right I don't know if I you know I don't know if I could friends what I'm telling you is God's vision let me maybe just to encourage I'll share a testimony with you when my son was about I think I touched on this last time I was here but it was some years ago and but this was a very deep difficult thing for my wife and I we go through we go through our trials together but she's a child of God she's a daughter of God and I'm a by God's grace a son of God and we we shoulder to shoulder we face the challenges that the Lord allows us to go through when my son was about two and a half months three and a half months old he's now by God's grace he is now five years old but when he was about that age he got pneumonia he got RSV which is a I believe is a viral pneumonia and he also got bacterial pneumonia as well infections in his lungs and it is fatal in in a percentage of children it's very dangerous it can be fatal under three months so I think it was he was two-and-a-half months old if I remember the numbers correctly so he was in a hospital and he went out on a Friday he ended up being there for two weeks and in those two weeks we almost lost him three different times let me tell you friends I had this the only way I know how to express it it will change your life if I know any of you have had serious situations life-threatening situations when the doctor comes in and the alarms are going off and everything is beeping and everything is you know there's a team of ten people run in and they're all on high alert and they're very serious the alarms are going off and your son has tubes going down the throat he's only two and a half months old can't breathe on his own he's been breathing like this for a week for a week he was at at something like a hundred and sixty or a hundred 70 respirations a minute something like that he's intubated they have air oxygen going in his lungs and fluid keeps building up and he's choking he's suffocating and you're sitting there as a mother and father looking at your son and there's not a thing you can do see this is what God has allowed me to go through this and many other things like it well God allowed me to go through is to learn that God is in control even when it's hard even when it rips your heart out even when it's painful God is still in control and if my son had died by God's grace I would be here preaching the exact same sermon as I am today because the outcome is the Lord's and if we can just understand that and be in our place and understand that God will do all things this is what we were learning in a very painful very hard way and we hear of a team of doctors the alarms are going off eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep and they're running in and they're very serious and we're sitting there terrified my wife and I all we can do is sit there and watch we're just in shock don't even know what to do and they say these words oh we have heartbeat again when you hear those words you start to realize how fickle that life is it is the hand of God that gives life it is the hand of God that can allow life to be taken but there were some brothers that came in friends of ours that came in from out of town and my wife and there there was two different time two different moments during those two weeks my wife and I after those things that happened my wife and I stopped or at the end of the day we're totally exhausted in every way mentally physically Lord we don't know what to do don't know what to do other than just trust you every moment so we held hands we bowed our heads and we prayed we said Lord you gave us our son we dedicated him into your hands when he was born and we will not take him back now friends when I talk to you about trust I'm not making things up the things that are most precious is in his life to me are my family my wife and my children and I know that many of you feel the same way I know that many of you are facing things in your life that you feel like but brother I need something more God cannot give you anything better than his own word that's the best he can give you just earlier this year let me finish that testimony but my wife and I held hands and we committed him into the hands of God again weak Lord we know that we cannot hold him we know that we are helpless and the Lord had also sent a couple brothers from out of town two brothers and we stood around my son's bed and I still remember this is I've given his testimony many times it's always difficult for me because of it took a year after this for my wife and I to be able to talk about it openly it was very difficult we had to just shut down and just live day to day to day it was so shocking just out of nowhere for us but these two brothers came and we stood around the end of his bed we bowed our heads and we prayed and I cannot explain it to you but what I remember at that time myself I was staying in there but what I remember is an outside view of three angels standing there praying the angel of God standing around watching over my son brother that's spiritual hi friends I can't I cannot tell you what I have seen I can only preach the gospel that you will know that deliverance is real deliverance is here today for you deliverance is a person and his name is Jesus Christ earlier this year my my wife had a very difficult miscarriage I was 45 minutes away my wife called me she said she had just lost the baby I was 45 minutes away and my my wife was bleeding to death the bleeding wouldn't stop friends I'm not giving you this testimony to make you emotional I can't help it because it's difficult for me I've given this testimony elsewhere but I'll give it again I don't like sharing things that are personal to me but if it will help you I will encourage you I will give you a testimony because I went through a very difficult time after this my wife was dying quickly I called some people I called 911 friends saints of God very lovely people and they dropped what they were doing didn't ask any questions jumped into motion they were ministering to me ministering to my wife well brother did they stop and pray no they didn't they jumped into action they had already been praying they were already ready for action when God called on them well brother shouldn't should they pray you can pray while you're moving friends sometimes we want to be so spiritual you know I can't do anything God wants your body friends if we get in order when God calls on you to move you can move you can make a difference the body can minister to the body brother are you telling me not to pray I'm not telling you not to pray I'm telling you should be praying and you should be ready when God calls for you by God's grace these brothers and their brother and sister were were ready to go when we called in them and they called they jumped into action and by God's grace God saved my wife that baby was I believe it was about 13 weeks old and I held that little flesh in my hands you know in the human mind you think about all the things that could be that's very hard emotionally so when I tell you that you can't rely on emotion I'm telling you this because I have been there I have been through it like I said I don't like sharing personal stories I don't like sharing personal things but friends this is the God that I serve this God who is with us in the private moments in the difficult moments of life that's the God that I serve and if God chooses to take life if he chooses to give a life blessed be the name of the Lord we must come to trust him explicitly in every way in everything that we can lay everything at his feet and say god it's all yours and sometimes we say that with our mouth but when it comes down to it we're holding on to it friends the safest place you can be the safest place that your family can be is in the hands of God and when God sets out to do something let him do it don't set boundaries and say God you can do everything but don't do this don't do this don't stop telling God what to do just let Dad do God let God be God let God be your Savior and when God steps in when he begins to move on the scene something good will come out of it this isn't a joke no friends I'm not preaching this because it sounds good and I'm trying to win win brownie points with somebody as the world would say I'm trying to oh I'm trying to express to you friends when you get in life and death when it's real these are the things that can keep you and if you are holding on to something else it will not work it will the world will break you the devil will break your mind the devil will break your heart and when you get into those moments maybe by God's grace the words of God's prophets or servants will ring in your ears give it all to God let it go set it down at the feet of Jesus leave it there and allow God to step in that's when the work begins sons and daughters of the Living God knowing that God is the one that knows God knows better than we do we want what we want but God already has a vision if we can submit ourselves to the vision of God and allow the vision of God to unfold everything will be just fine let's continue on very quickly now let's go to Romans 11 let me give you one more testimony this one's a little easier if anybody's having financial difficulties today you know that God is the king of all God of all things you know the first unfolding is that God is above all things and I was my wife and I were we had done our bills for the month and we were I don't know how much it was but it was several hundred dollars short we couldn't pay our bills we didn't have the money to pay our bills we bowed our heads in a very similar prayer Lord Jesus you know in my home I'm not to provide her God is the provider I can't do anything God can take my mind tomorrow just like that what can I do I can't do anything we bow our heads and said Lord Jesus you're the provider we trust you Lord we ask that you will take care of these things for Lord we we're doing the best that we know how to do but we've fallen short I was working at home and I went upstairs to where I had a desk and I sat down not 10 minutes later friends my wife comes upstairs with a check did you see this no I didn't see that it was a check for two or three times the amount that we needed in 10 minutes you know the beautiful thing about that that letter was already in the mailbox when I prayed I want you to think about that friend there might have been some process something happened some series of events that had been going on maybe for months and the moment that I prayed it arrived God is already working to answer your prayer before you prayed it God isn't surprised by your difficulties God is not surprised at the hard moments God is not surprised by anything he knows all things and if we can submit ourselves to division of guess what we will begin to realize more and more that he's already God he already sees it and if we can submit ourselves to his vision we begin to see what he sees and as we begin to see what he sees oh that doesn't matter the amount in my savings account that doesn't matter the amount in my bank account have you met my god have you met my lord my Jesus because that God the Bible says he has cattle on a Thousand Hills it's a way of representing he has well without measure he has if he needs to create something in your pocket he can create something in your pocket if he needs an out of thin air make something God can do that and sometimes we we believe yes God could do that but will he do it that's where we fail so many times friend but will he do it here in Romans the 12th chapter I went out when I pulled these verses this morning did not realize this verse was in here where we're starting from something we've been looking at much recently and this is what we're talking about today although we haven't talked to set it in this way but here we're gonna start here with what we're talking about today what we're talking about is a change of thought a change of vision if we see God's vision things look very differently than our own vision let's see how much it will affect us let's read the scripture and see what the Bible will tell us when our vision change when our mind changes let's see what happens Romans 12 verse number 2 and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind you mean to tell me that just a change of thought can transform you brother Branham said if you have the right mental attitude the right mental attitude to the promise of God will make them come to pass let's continue on that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God there we go the will of God once again the will of God for I say verse number 3 for I say through grace through the grace given unto me that every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according to God as have dealt to every man the measure of faith for as you have many members in one body all members have not the same office so we being many members are one body in Christ and every one members 1 excuse me and every one members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teaches on teaching or he that exhorteth on an exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor referring one another now how does this next verse fit with what we just read because it sounds so spiritual right let's see what what this looks like in verse very simply in verse number eleven not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the Lord not slothful in business he is talking about how the body ministers the body and suddenly he's talking about being not slothful in business doesn't it mean that I need to go home and pray and talk to nobody for weeks and weeks he says be not slothful in business friends there's there is a contradiction happening here because the that sometimes the idea in our minds is that we have to do something that is so spiritual as that I heard them many that I say it is what many of the old-timers used to say it this way no offense that anybody is older than me used to say it this way sometimes we can be so heavenly minded that we are no earthly good we are trying to interpret the Bible in something so spiritually minded that we forget that here is the instruction be not slothful in business huh you mean to tell me I don't just forget about everything Oh what did Esther do King come home with me King come to work with me King what should I do now what should I do at this time what should I do it this time it is the life that God gave you that's what he wants he doesn't just want two or three hours on Sunday maybe a couple hours on Wednesday that's not what God wants God wants everything and when he says be not slothful in business what he's saying here what brother that's just carnal and it that sounds contradictory I know it but bear with me is it the Bible says talking about being an order the body million or be not slothful in business mother why are you emphasizing this because we should take the things that we that God is dealing with us on and apply it to what to everything I wake up in the morning and I brush my teeth or brother that's trivial you know if you meet if your wasteful with brushing your teeth and your teeth fall out and then we're complaining well well God why did my teeth fall out God gave you a toothbrush in toothpaste right well brother that's just simple but then we get into trouble because we don't do the simple things and then we're running to God knowing why did this happen because you didn't do two simple things that God gave you that's I think that's just the simplest example that we could possibly have well that just couldn't be worth anything this might be really trivial but I tell you what I'm just going to be real real simple after preaching and your mouth gets real dry for an hour and a half your breath doesn't smell so good right it happens that's kind of awkward I know I don't care it's just the way it is this body is dying it's just the way it is it's gonna keep on dying until God changes it that's the way it is and I tell you what if my breath was so bad I was trying to testify to somebody and that person couldn't hear what I was saying cuz my breath was so bad right that can't get any simpler being diligent in the small things we get slothful in the little things in life and then they hinder the work of God and then we cry out to God then why does this happen why does that happen because we're slothful in business I've never heard it friends I didn't plan it that way that is a I don't know why breath of all things but brushing your teeth but I don't think that could be any simpler right if we do that don't do two simple things that we struggle with those things because what we want is God's Word the we have the term the rubber eats that meets the road we want the word to sink in and begin to move us brother how is that deliverance just do what God gave you to do don't be slothful in business in the business God gave you don't be slothful well brother isn't it isn't it supposed to be spiritual friends David had victories in private before he met Goliath he had his little business in order and then God called him out on the battlefield why cuz David already had victory in his daily business he was out as a boy taking care of the sheep because that's what he was given to do well brother I'm just this you know little nobody and I don't really have anything significant to do friends I guarantee you that's what David felt like if you were to ask David as a little shepherd boy are you gonna kill a Goliath why would I'm nobody but then the lion came and he grabbed it by the beard was that David and he smote it I don't know about you like like I said about the Bears right they say well they're more afraid of you than you are of them if you believe that go ahead he got more faith than I do I think but David did it he grabbed it he killed a bear or killed the lion he smote it in private with no one there he was not slothful in his business and because everything was in order God said David today's the day and all that David heard was hey David take some food to your brothers that was God calling him today is the David you've been prepared you've been preparing it you don't even know it and now today is the day to go on the battlefield and here David is just think well I just do in the business that God gave me I don't my dad told me to do this so I'm out there taking care of the sheep I'm just a little boy and then there was something that just came out of David what Philistine dares to defy the armies of the Living God well what was David doing he was just doing his business he took the responsibility God gave him and took it seriously if we can take the business that God gives us seriously when God calls on us we got something there David had something to give because he was there in the wilderness playing smite in the bear smiting the lion he was training for a purpose and the day came when God said hey David your brothers are hungry okay I'll take him some food Oh Phil uh you you you Jews are so afraid who's talking like that who is this Oh David Shh go home David go home there was something in David that was being cultivated it was growing and when God called him he fit right where he was supposed to be there was strength that he brought where did it come from doing his business taking care of the bear taking care of the lion well why did he what does he say when he goes out before Goliath as God delivered me from the lion as God delivered me from the bear so shall it be with you Goliath he was training are you training do you want great victories before God uma asses again and I want you to consider in your heart if you want victories I'm gonna ask it in just a moment think about it do you want me if you want victories then raise your hand there's your testimony if you want victories then don't be slothful in the business God gave you take it seriously your business is not separate from the instruction of God your business is the instruction of God then go diligently and brother man says just go live humbly live a good Christian life do what God told you to do what brother that's just not big enough David had to do the little things and then when when the Google app was there David comes out there like this and David says haha you send a boy in God says I don't need a man to do their job I don't need a man to do that job I can send a boy that's all I need but that boy has been preparing for anyone younger ones that are here sometimes you feel like you can't work for God yes you can just don't be slothful in business whatever God gives you well brother what does that mean clean your room brush your teeth get up in the morning well brother I have a hard time you know being orderly I struggle with that I struggle being orderly but God gave me a responsibility and if I can't do it today I can still call upon God god help me and God will help me and before you know it God will then call on that thing and it might be here in the church maybe there's something else that needs to be done and the thing that you've been training on at home God can then pull on it brothers and sisters if this sounds like this is too simple or too deep I hope it doesn't I hope it's real simple but this is how the body is supposed to work everything this we're talking about God's vision amen everybody doing all right praise the Lord now we're going to close here in just a moment so let's turn to first Corinthians 12 and then we're actually going to come back to Thessalonians and then we're just going to we're going to close here like I said in just a moment first Corinthians 12 everyone's still doing all right praise the Lord like we're like I said to the young people day I thank you for your patience and I know that we're slugging through right now we're slugging through that's what we're doing right now well we're gonna start going scripture to scripture like this sometimes you just feel like it's like oh we're just trying to push sometimes that's okay it's members not what we feel like it's God's Word first Corinthians 12 and 14 first Corinthians 12 and 14 for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I'm not a hand I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I'm not the eye I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where is the hearing if the whole body is hearing where is the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased who pleased God pleased him and if they all were on one body or one member where where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of thee we'll stop there let's go back to 1st Thessalonians how can I say to the hand I have no need of thee that's not how God made it to work well brother that that it's got to be more spiritual than that it is spiritual are you spiritual enough to catch it I don't mean disrespect anybody or challenge anybody in a carnal kind of way but friends I I was born and raised around a message and around people that just thought they all knew it and I've seen a lot of people go back out in the world and one of the things that Falls the first is a lack of responsibility in the church in the assembly lack of responsibility for one another what is God's vision that every member will work together here in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 now let's read verses 8 to 12 again let's see the nature of the message here this is Paul again speaking to the Thessalonians verse number 8 he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but God who hath also given unto us His Holy Spirit but as touching Lily love now this is him talking to the Thessaloniki living in that well the group of that were the Thessalonians I believe was called Thessalonica but I'm not sure but as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you unto you for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another he's saying you got this right and indeed you do it toward all the Brethren which are in all Macedonia but you but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more and that you might be studied to be what quiet hmm to do what your own business and to work with your own as we commanded you that you may walk honestly toward them that are without those are that means that those that are not Christians and that you may have lack of nothing hmm but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so then which are at which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord I'm sorry we already read this earlier here a bit and because we broke this up this is this is where I wanted to say I wanted to stop here at verse number 12 so let's back up and we'll just read verse number 12 again but that you may walk walk honestly toward them that are without that she may have lack of nothing you know this is friends to me this is so wonderful so let's back up to verse number 11 that you study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we have commanded you brother I need more than that there isn't there isn't God's Word we all said amen earlier God's Word is total deliverance do you know that every time that God comes he will announce through his prophets this is going to happen this is going to happen and everyone is looking for this grand scheme they're looking for the fireworks they're looking for the thunder and the Lightning's to just shake them to the point where all yet this is what God is doing but every time it comes so simple that everybody says but it can't be that it can't be a baby in a manger it can't be a little baby that comes floating on a raft and and the princess picks up a little baby that can't be the savior of the Jews it's just a baby it's just a man it can't be that salvation is already here it's it's got to be something that's coming it's not coming friends it's already here God's Word the fullness of the message is here today at any moment God is gonna say it's enough it's done but it needs to be something bigger there isn't full deliverance right here study to be quiet oh brother you know what about fighting Goliath now that's big study to be quiet David studied to be quiet and then he met Goliath and his spirit was quiet even when he faced a giant gods vision when you face the giant what's this I've already been training God's already taught me I already have knowledge I've already seen faith work remember add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge in the little things of life God is teaching us faith and then he's adding to it virtue you start with today maybe it's brushing our teeth it's a simple example but I like simple examples because we all have to brush our teeth we all wake up in the morning and we don't like the way our breath smells right I mean if you don't tell me your secret but if we can be diligent in the small things right we do that with our children teach them to small things God's doing the same thing with us learn the small things and raise up and you feel like it's a bunch of rules today but remember that when God is teaching us it's not about the rules we're learning what God is teaching us we're learning the little lessons that we might grow up in the stature of a perfect man that everything might be in this place but don't shirk the little things don't let go the little things have every little element every piece that God gives you in your life in order I need something bigger there isn't something bigger for the hardest things to I could tell you from experience if you can conquer the little things the big things are nothing it's the little things that happen at home when you're alone that are the biggest challenge where does your mind go are you disciplined when you're alone do you do things that you know no one else will ever know do you still do the right thing do you still do what God told you to do when no one sees it that's what David did and when God needed David God needed David because he prepared him for a purpose when God called on David David said yeah I'll go I already have knowledge I've already seen what faith can do oh it's just a Philistine but Dave he's so what are you gonna do David it doesn't matter you don't understand how big God is you see I've already met God and that that Goliath he's nothing where did David learn it at home in private he learned his lessons but then when it was time to minister to the body he was ready and everything just fit together just like that praise the Lord I believe that does that that come out kind of simple hey man I pray that it is I pray that it's simple for you well brother I need something greater there's nothing greater than God's Word complete deliverance well brother where does faith come in faith is everything the message is Jesus Christ faith is everything it's faith in God's Word that we stand upon and if you believe God's Word and do God's Word well I need faith on these things okay the word saying is study to be quiet well what kind of faith does that that take try it and see I didn't see because if you study to be quiet you know what happens the devil is there Oh devil sit down devil sit down and wait your turn I'm reading my Bible and one of the time okay now now devil I have time for you you get in line you can't say that to a devil sure you can study to be quiet that your spirit is quiet and when your spirit is quiet for I wish I could express it the way I see it because here's David looking at Goliath you want anything but he's so big so what have you seen my god can I tell you about him you know what I can tell you about him but you have to learn for yourself we were giving an example to the kids I'll end with this so for the young people yesterday we're giving an example of what the message is and they hold it but one to another when the message is given as let's give today for an example God laid this message on my heart I was praying a pray Lord just nothing had peace nothing at peace and the Lord gave me a little thought and just begin to build what's in my heart is I try to give it to you I I can ask this is why I asked earlier do you want victory we all agreed yes we want more of God we want victory that's our testimony if you want it then God will give it to you but when it comes don't be surprised when it doesn't appear flashy when it seems like it's less than what you expected because that's the way God always does it oh it's so simple that the world doesn't want it my brother I just I don't know then ask God to open your eyes if you believe me to be God's servant if you believe that God has been here at all today then you pray in your heart that God will show you what I'm just trying to express from the bottom of my heart I have seen the things were in my life where I have failed it's because I'd already failed in the little things I've already failed I've already been slothful in the little business that God gave me to do and then when the big battle came I fell and then here I all why did I fall in a big battle because I failed in the little things does it did the Prophet not preach God revealed in simplicity that's what it is friends and I pray that something today has struck for you to encourage you God is calling you to be part of the body to minister to the body every member supplies no one can say that you're not needed sisters brothers young old you're all needed in the economy of God the the plan of God the way that God has designed this church body to work God didn't call you to join a church he called you to be the church God didn't call you to act like sons and daughters he calls you to be sons and daughters a man let's all stand I'll invite the musicians to come thank you for being patient but friends if there's something in your heart that is struck for you today now is a good time just to take a few moments say Lord I may not understand all of what brothers say brother Nathanael was saying or maybe I do I don't know where you're at God knows but I don't know but now is we can just worship for a few moments and just now just let the Lord know what's in your home the Lord I believe has blessed us today but now what what do we do with it now is it is it like a sheep kind of push out wool Oh Lord I'm just going to try real hard don't try to serve God just get to know him if you get to know God everything else falls in place when God gives you a little responsibility do the little responsibility don't be slothful in business study to be quiet well brother why would you say these things because this is where the battles at and when the big things come you've already had big victory because you've been training at home praying in the quiet moments when no one else is looking that's where the victory is won that's where the victories [Music] can we lower it down just a little bit it's already done it's already [Music] [Laughter] [Music] the battle is over the victory is won it's already done [Music] it's already done it's already done [Music] the battle is over the picture is one it's already done it's already done it's already done the battle is over how the victory is won it's already done [Music] it's already done [Music] it's already done [Music] the battle is over the victory is won it's already done Jesus is here Jesus is me [Music] is got my choice whole theater is a one now as they play that very softly before the Lord what a wonderful song the battles already done friend we're just opening our eyes to the Lord is opening our eyes to so as they play that softly we're gonna pray now we pray what was preached today but we're gonna pray and ask God that God will make it real to us you know it made the Bible says make your calling and election sure your personal calling and election sure that's what I'm praying for for you friends will you pray that for me will you pray that God will lead me in all true that righteousness because that's what I'm praying for you so let we're gonna pray about friends as we pray I want you to not only pray for yourself but think about someone that you love someone that you care about and say Lord I want to be so into with you that my life begins to affect others that my life is so unordered in the little things that I'm not slothful in business that the very life of Christ is reflected in every part of my life will you pray that prayer with me Amen let's lift our hands before the Lord Lord Jesus I thank you so much Lord for the time of fellowship that we've had today lord I thank you for this people here that a bit so patient Lord as we've we've gone through the word we've gone verse to verse and just laid out a case God sometimes it's it's difficult to do that but Lord we're looking to your foundation that we can stand on your word not because a man said it but because God has said and Lord as we all praying together now we're praying not only for ourselves but for one another Lord I pray that you would honor the prayers that we're asking today because this pray Lord we're not looking for a bed of ease we're not looking for an easy life nor we're looking for your will that's what we want and know what we pray that you have preeminence not only in our lives but Lord and those that were praying for whatever it takes Lord if it be coming close to death so be it Lord if it be financial difficulties so be it it would be some other confusion or difficulty life's so be it Lord if that's your will you know best and we trust Lord that's my prayer today and I pray that you will be with these precious precious people Lord they've given their time I pray that you would honor it the sacrifice Lord they've lifted up their hands they defy gravity Lord may we defy the gravity of the sin of this world Lord may we live contrary to this world but live and reflect you in a smallest details of our lives that we might reflect you Lord that we might be you not slothful in business studying to be quiet in whatever business it Lord even the children here Lord you've given them school to do Lord help them not to be slothful in that for Lord if you tarry there are going to be the the mainstays of the church before long God raised them up make them strong Lord raise up David's and Caleb's Lord Caleb had a different spirit and because he had a different spirit he was able to take the land knowing I pray you give us a different spirit Lord than the world has ever seen God may you testify in us that there's a spirit that can take the land that we can live every promise the small things the big things and when to do and Goliath is set before us we can already see that he is nothing the devil has no arrows not even death and stand in the way we will not hinder those that sleep help us Lord to be an order help us Lord to be diligent in every word that proceeds from the mouth of God hey lord I thank you Lord for the simplicity that gospel and I thank you Lord with these precious people that have listened to the word today I pray Lord that you would help it to make it become so simple that they can see you and

creatures can live what you're telling us to do and Lord [Music] as we're growing in faith and virtue in knowledge I'll pray also that you attempt for us Lord give us the temperance that were not
