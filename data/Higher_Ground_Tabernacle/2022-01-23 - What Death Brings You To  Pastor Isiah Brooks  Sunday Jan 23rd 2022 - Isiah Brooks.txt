thank god for his goodness and his grace [Music] as i've heard our brother savannah and sister stephanie had a baby boy at least we know that the church is increasing [Music] amen [Applause] and we thank god for those who traveled from iowa city we appreciate you coming up we're going to associate [Music] in the last few days i've had four close friends die don lee [Music] brother charlie spencer from virginia the franchise brother ross from lima ohio brother ross brother ramji from trinidad and of course charlie's sister-in-law uh would be her his uh daughter-in-law excuse me passed a few hours prior to his past and they were buried this week as well i don't know the calls for every one of their deaths [Music] the more i think about this message i appreciate the grace of god because every one of us will meet god at some point in time we're going to see him so as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to saint luc we're going to start reading uh the 16th chapter of saint luc one of the things that happens i was seeking the lord on a lot of things and he said my sheep were here with my voice shepherd of the lord so that was a real comfort to me and a strength to me because we're living in the last days satan is putting pressure on every hand and he's doing everything that he can do to overthrow the word for satan uh the 24th verse of that particular chapter and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame it's but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy good things and likewise laughter is evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented equally between us and you there is a great golf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to you and that would come from this suit and then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou withered send him to my father's house for i have brethren thy brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come unto this place of torment thank you for and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead we ask once again that you turn with us the first john through the 16th verse season you'll see for see we we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death who hated whosoever hated his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren [Music] we ask that you turn with us to and we're going to read the 21st verse [Music] that as sin has reigned unto death even so my grace reigned through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord afraid [Music] of you have [Music] but i say these things because they are true and i pray lord god this morning that somehow you would reach the inner core of your that holy place that place that you have designated to be your throne oh god have mercy upon our souls we come before you lord uh i thank god for those of you who were praying for them and praying for me as well i came to bring this message this morning because i realized the way we all live even the way we think sometimes we fail to really realize the importance of importance of living a holy and sanctified life the vivo in the center many of us being that we confess the message but the message if it's not quickened to you is a dead letter because the message is not something uh tangible it's not stuff written on pages about the shows it is christ himself she pleased to remember and you can understand the message by way of an intellectual concept intellectual even as paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not charities it profits you nothing i was telling a friend of mine the other day i said this is not the season to fight it's not the season to fuss all of these things the devil brings to distract you but we must understand that we this is a time to focus on the coming of the lord brother branham tells us [Music] and oftentimes that quote and when god accepts you you're going to he seals this morning what will death bring to you jesus i read about the rich young ruler and this man once was a real christian but he allowed his riches to get in his way to social media hallelujah he lost focus on his purpose for being here objective you see and because he lost his focus he did not have the compassion and love for his brethren that he should have had but god gave him a second chance when he turned god away when the lord said unto him follow me more sell all that you have give your riches to the poor with me and follow me hallelujah it was at that point he made a decision that will affect him until [Music] lazarus because jesus had already preached the message if you give one of these little ones a drink of water you shall be rewarded god will give them eternal life jesus said to him jesus have you done this have you done that as a church member he was great he didn't love you he had done everything basically the law required you see god doesn't give you riches but those riches are given to you amen hallelujah now sometimes we're poor if you find some povo just as poor as that with a woman that came to the offering table and gave her two mites to do since and jesus said is his reality she has given more can ever than anybody in the church service there were wealthy men there yeah wealthy men there [Music] how are you going to pay your rent come on what should be where your food is going to come from all those things that satan normally brings to our minds to hinder us from doing the will of god see wherever your heart is that's where your treasures will be when my friends passed away it was me into the city and the thing that i thought about okay was today which way did they go catch your mountain when death struck they came to their door door lost which way did they go yes i don't know your heart i don't know their hearts all i know is that i hope by god's grace no doubt this rich man remain religious he found himself in a place that he thought he would not and being that he was the sixth son and he had he said brother said even when god called him he called him to be an evangelist you understand me he had a gift of evangelism and no amen you're going to have to answer every gift that god give has given unto you hallelujah now those are not my words it's just those are the words of brother branson we are going to take something with us i'm making sure what that something is it's a question it's all we can take with us nothing less now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like this uh the whole his whole character let me read that again will it be like his whole character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction oh will it be softness [Music] every man will bear even as the prophet has said remember i really want you to think because personally i am tired get you there god knows i'm fighting against that system i don't care if you say brother brooks is in the message or brother is not in the message because you don't know where i am but i can tell you where i am i'm in christ hallelujah listen is that right paul had a message for you but paul's message was christ william branham had a message but his message was christ because we have been in different churches under certain ministries and the army is there we feel like we're all right something some correct but look at all the men all of the people man who followed moses joshua whatever you are when is not in you you are not in the message amen now i'm going to tell you the truth because none of us want to die because i know this message came from god and i don't know what the what's his next movie but you need to know and examine yourself this morning to make sure that you are in the faith the bread behind this is the bread that was behind the veil you understand me excuse me so let's move on i don't have one song if you are a doubter you'll be raised a doubter if you die however the tree falls when it lays that's what it is hallelujah oh i can hear some of your thinking but that's okay reflections the reflection you know reflection is something that uh we know about reflection when i was a boy we play with the mirror sunlight hit the mirror and then we'll throw a reflection hallelujah it's kind of like a shadow how can i say it it's like remember some of y'all don't know what i'm talking about in my day in order to develop that uh negative into the real picture so it would be defined whatever more you had to take it into a dark room and you had to put it in this this negative it would be functioning you have to put it in these chemicals and these chemicals of now we are the and right now we're in what we call the dark room and those chemicals of death amen will develop you hallelujah this will show who you are and we have the pictures as evidence it is don't like her you understand me amen you take people who use the talents can live any kind of way now and then we die god is going to do one of these snap your fingers make us rich or make us holy spell the new sound no no no no it doesn't work that way oh i've got the holy ghost oh because i come to church because i pay my taxes you pay me because i pay my offer because you pay me doesn't mean one thing you can do all of that and still not [Music] put a finger on my life but when he met that pillow called himself had to receive the holy ghost don't you let nobody talk you that's what determines it have you been changed the bible said you changed from death and to life the bible says you become a new creature and the old things are passed away um is that right you can't be good and evil at the same time jesus said make the tree good jesus or make it evil we're not living in a time where god is accepting would you accept her the tree of good and evil you understand me you got to be good oh you got to be evil and there's only one good and that concern that's god [Music] amen take for example horizontal when a baby is born again this can be living it takes a spanking it's full in now they come out almost with calculators they already know how to cry you don't speak them you don't have to they come out screaming and then i just believe by god's grace that's how it is with or you would go somewhere else your brother adam says from darius and divine healing if you know the jerusalem message 54. let me tell you what you are here scrutin is a reflection [Music] already in the presence of the father we have a glorified body wasn't that deep all right so we'll find out whether it's right or [Music] so right now meant to know and what we are there is a reflection here what we are here is a reflection of what we are somewhere else if your ds [Music] would you rather me say a lie to you this must be something you must consider and understand because you say you in the message does not guarantee and you must have come from god in order to go back to god and the only way you'll know you came from god it's when god seals your history and gives you his approval shame on us i know it's cold outside the 65th water bring that atmosphere in the church we bring our attitudes in the church and i'm going to tell you this this morning god has re has on his own camera caught your attitude and and and the way you behave when it comes to worshiping god hallelujah you say you in the message live like you in the message rejoice like you in the message act like you in the masses i don't serve a dead god i can't stand it i can't stand it now if you want to make me angry is when you come in here like my god is a methodist or a catholic son he's the [Music] [Music] you supposed to give him sacrifice what kind of place you you're in [Music] amen hallelujah let me move on this morning like i said this life is a negative negative and it's got to be developed is if something in you is not groaning for perfection there is something wrong with your experience [Music] comes but i gotta have it kind of remind me of the woman when she went down to simon's house uh she heard that jesus was at simon's house and she and she did not stop until she fell at the feet of jesus you understand me i don't care about opposition they make me stronger they make me a fighter not for me but for the kingdom of god hallelujah what difference does it make hallelujah if somebody doesn't like you what different does it make if you want what you must go through it's going to be a family affair hallelujah but you must make up in your mind that you're going to see jesus that's why i sing that song when i die let me rise and when i rise let me see jesus i don't care about nobody else hallelujah so many people i'm gonna say it because we think calling on the name of william branham and the bible says there is no salvation yeah but any other on the other there is no other name in heaven that we must be saved but foreign he said oh i call on the name of brother there's nothing wrong with that yeah but that's not your salvation brother branham is not christ hallelujah he was anointed by christ he had christ and jesus said this is ready i'm not the one that's doing the work it's him that's doing the work and when i see him doing the work then i go forth and do them hallelujah did not william branham do the same he said i'm waiting on him hallelujah and when he would come he lost when he would reveal what was in the hearts of the people not the man the bride of jesus christ the positions of priests will never be satisfied by satisfaction with satan's eden amen amen hallelujah see we long for perfection hallelujah [Applause] [Music] the only thing that makes it la is that character okay it's in you that have been formed through the fiery trials that you and i have gone we are going through hallelujah [Laughter] you love the lord amen what would that bring to you was not the rich young ruler no doubt he thought because he was blessed in a financial way that was on his side but great gain is not godliness the girl great gain or the gun is not godliness uh a short season because shortly after that he was in his own home and god came again god allowed him to return came back and visited him when she was already gone crossing over she said oh brother bill that's you you can't imagine what it's like hallelujah amen she said is is this it's beautiful more beautiful than i'm paraphrasing than you can imagine she said hallelujah but you've been preaching this but you have no idea what it is she and we should have ignored mama on the v i [Applause] that same kind of holy ghost filled fire baptized people remember hallelujah the same screaming hollowing jumping running power of god that struck the people that's what they call trash hallelujah but those were god's kind of people and if it was that time yesterday it's that kind this heresy the way they call crazy even your prophet said you ought to get out of order long enough to get the holy ghost justification you can't baptize sanctification you can't pass the baptism of the holy ghost and expect to come into the capstone ministry it will not work and it is the [Music] the baptism of the holy spirit um [Music] [Music] amen oh my you love the lord revelations if you should die today would be your result think about it you're gambling with your soul for him to do it to him who to know to do good to him this is something that we shouldn't even have to be concerned about because revelations 2 apocalypses this is not a political move i'm trying to help this morning she said did this and i trust that god would help us i came up you know my mother raised me baptist my mama [Music] i left the catholic church went back to the methodist church from the messenger church i went to the apostolic church and that's the jesus that's the jesus only folks it's only john jesus only mentioned classified as you know what i couldn't shout in the catholic church and in the methodist church i was too fanatical it only did fantastic then i went to the apostolic church where all the shouting's supposed to be going on like this you know what they told me you see how ridiculous you're shaming me oh you don't have to you carry on like that hallelujah and it's that same attitude in the message that's what i mean my teacher you don't mean they don't care if the method is coming they don't care in this message find themselves in hell because they have blasphemed the holy ghost by speaking of it like it's some evil unclean spirit somebody didn't like that one but it's okay because i feel like a lot of people have been bewitched a spell y'all don't know what a spell is nope in her full potential that means signs and wonders miracles and everything else that comes with it hallelujah not only that but you'll see her in her life [Music] now i know i'm going a little longer than i intended just section but i want you to understand you must understand your influence i listen to brother branham's table almost every day every day and the anointing that comes off of those tapes it's greater than the anointing i feel in most churches what's wrong with that have you ever seen brother branham rebuke the anointing absolutely he always gave reverence absolutely an honor to the anointing hallelujah and then we get into the church and when the holy ghost fall some of us are afraid to enter into that presence because we wonder what others will think about us and let me tell you something listen you need a real experience there is no way i will be ashamed of my lord my y'all understand what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is this you just said the same brass serpent lumens [Music] and then god had to tear the image down hallelujah it was christ it has always been the lord it has always been the anointing that destroys none because i'm a preacher doesn't guarantee me a place in heaven because there's a lot of preachers they are now running the foot race in hell because they've deceived the people amen hallelujah you might as well sit here and enjoy yo and repent whatever you need to do hallelujah amen because you see this message i know came from god hallelujah and some of us we get to the place we're so stubborn and we don't even know that they're stubborn it's like like witchcraft you come into this church with your attitude and you think that you're going to shut down hallelujah you think you're going to shut down the holy ghost but the holy ghost can't be shut down not in me if he was just in the building you have to control that but when he's in me and when he's in other people you cannot control the holy ghost the holy ghost is a free spirit listen to this it is god let me tell y'all people listen those of us who love to rejoice those of you who love to scream and holler for the name of jesus don't let nobody and it's building character in me and taking away all fears [Music] i'm gonna go back to ezekiel you don't have to turn there everyone that uses this proverb against against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter hallelujah you understand me and the mother was a head tight and one that is broken and one who is is is wrapped in fears i may not make the rapture god is not going to answer my prayers just all kinds of stuff dude it also means to be a troublemaker because you find the rebels you find people that the least little thing they get bitter and you know what they're going to do they're going to babble hallelujah yeah that's the truth no a cans will be there these kind of people won't be there remember but they thought moses you're not the only holy man there's only one message so we give honor to our prophet william brandon but let me tell you something calling on his name um um but he said the witches had the chair suspended in the air and he said in the name of father son and holy ghost because they challenged him and he says in the name of the father son and the holy ghost nothing happened he said in the name of william nothing happened but when he said in the name of the lord jesus christ he said the chairs dropped so hard it almost broke every leg off of him the power was in the name of jesus christ i don't know you're going to marry i'm going to marry jesus christ y'all understand me there's only one husband there's only one handshape and that hardship is my lord jesus christ you say we're not like that oh yes we are or we will do something we may not call them popes and bishops but still let them lord over us and the holy ghost is supposed to be your lord somebody those preachers out there they're having these great mega churches they're riding in these fine cars and having these five houses and we're doing the same thing like the mother so is the daughters amen i don't care whether you like it i'm preaching [Music] there is nothing that you could offer me to make me change my way of preaching fulfillment [Music] amen amen i came to iowa with god jesus jesus think about it you say oh brother books what are you saying and i know how some of y'all gonna take this message you're gonna take it so like i'm picking on somebody nobody talk to me that's only about god himself it's a true remember amen think about it the thief in luke 23 the one that was on the cross see that's how it begins you see the difference between the the the two thieves is that one had representation they both were thieves they both had bad records but on the inside of the inside [Music] [Music] when you enter into your kingdom have mercy on me i won when that thing saw them put that heading above their that means he's you because i am a jew and he says lord when you enter into your kingdom see he believed the sign that what the romans put over his head what's the truth identity of this word hallelujah when you enter into your kingdom lord remember me have mercy on me and jesus said this day because you believe it you see believing william branham is a problem you got to understand what's behind where you're brandon it wasn't a man it was the almighty god and when you can see god behind the man and truly believe the message will transform you amen hallelujah it'll transform you you but i find it very hard to preach the people the precision and they look like they're dead no matter what you say they just got that dead look he's also a god more hallelujah no smiles sometimes you want to i want to just walk down there and flip your eyes back the pressure is like what in the world that's what brother brown said to the brandon kaplan do what i've done it's become too common it's too common is that betrayal like i was telling you i'ma tell you all too if i was to play a tape here this is a visual he playing the tape he's playing the table i ain't [Applause] you you don't have no place to go and if it be a baptist church and all you know you can get is one slice you say go get the slides how can you justify it that brother ain't deep enough he is [Applause] something's wrong with your experiences there are churches you say well there are churches that play the tapes and that's all they play and they don't have a life you know now how would you know that you got a church what's up everything they got a preacher so how was your life amen amen she had always come back i'm almost done some of y'all gonna be glad too i know lord of god ain't got good i want you to realize this morning i i'm saying this and i'm preaching out of love i'm preaching out of concern because right now i could drop dead that's coming right now and if it was to happen i know which way i'm going just sit right here amen you say brother books have you done everything right y'all waiting for the answer no no but i've been doing my best amen pressing into the holiness and the righteousness every day how many are fighting if you don't right against wrong hallelujah maybe a little cake but but y'all know what i mean he takes those things that he know that you have a a pool [Music] but you can never let the devil make you think he has more power let me read this is what you also see coming from go tell my disciples that would be paragraph 282. listen to what brother branham says it's disconformity and many of us my friends have missed the mark on monkey calling in christ it's because we didn't recognize many times at the judgment don't i'm [Music] yes you do you definitely don't appreciate me being here because you don't show that oh boy let me read this when you realize that religion of jesus christ brings salvation and happiness which is called as paul said in the days of oh in the way that's called heresy heresy is crazy you know in the way that's called heresy what's crazy you can find this on a college campus oh i'm just listening oh i'm making sure he don't err discerning my spirit the holy ghost will have come and gone see we don't worship like that no more they say you don't know nothing about a tree tell me something whether it be apple tree whether it be orange trees whatever kind of tree it is apples when that spring time comes and those leaves comes on those trees and that wind begins to blow it doesn't matter how old the tree is those leaves clap their hands they're going to worship god when the bride of jesus christ stops worshiping god she is not the bride amen we don't act like the pentecostal well they have fanaticism and their fanaticism is emotion and this so-called bride fanaticism fanaticism is no emotion god brother because i get into the message don't get me wrong everybody that god has blessed to have great churches should we could you have been here [Music] come on somebody where the pastors can't sit down with the with the with the congregation brother took his people out to eat and sit at the same table in the apostolic church the preachers and the deacons had a certain section and the rest of the congregation had a certain secret maybe i exaggerated a little bit but my uh my point is there was a noticeable difference even then i thought that was hypocrisy and i find it hypocrisy today don't tell me ain't real and i'm almost done right because i had some visitors in my house or whatever where they were and they got mad at me because i was helping my wife wash the dishes don't come to my house you might find me helping my wife wash dishes or give me a call happily more and ask have you washed the dishes yet who was shame on you my prophet helped his wife wash dishes man washing dish is going to make you a girl fella said that that's true don't ask her to help you work then really her place is at home don't send her out there you can't help her wash dishes i'm stepping on somebody's toes yes sir [Applause] that's nonsense [Music] traditional whatever but anyhow i don't wash dishes every day but when i see my wife struggling and she's tired i'm going to help her do something and i'm saying go fix me some food [Music] don't tell me y'all don't do it y'all do it you get mad when that food ain't ready [Music] the bible said love your wife as christ loved the church hallelujah and that's beyond traditions i don't care what somebody else says no man no woman is going to come into my house and you don't want to miss it amen amen said you did everything right but you just wouldn't help your wife i did a farm i'm sorry maybe i i'm leaning too too much on that side but this is where they put that i just that's a good thing i feel um anyway let's move on i don't want to say it i know i don't you know let me let me go on let me go on i'm almost done i'm almost done oh give me grace see they they don't understand the holy ghost works only by him by his laws it was against the law for jesus to talk with the ill-fated woman and he stood there with her to speak to my kind of people first all about samaritan and then you know what kind of work i do jesus wasn't looking at the outward go get your husband a porto marie see what we don't understand is we must be new creatures you can't bring that old stuff in and expect to reach 100. whatever you mean the holy ghost will convict you if it's wrong he will convict you he'll come to your mind he will come to you he'll come into your heart the real holy ghost is not going to absolutely [Music] deeper situation and say oh she didn't mean that oh he didn't mean that oh you feel bad elementary but it's true you know at the back side of the desert i always think about that phrase on the back side of the desert that means you got to travel through the desert specifically to get to the back side you got to come through some hardships in order to get there but when you get there you may you need him he said one writer said that the only thing that god had did to death and the only thing death shows can do is pull a believer into the presence of his maker the only thing amen let me tell you something this one with your truth you don't even know what joy is persevering until the word can give you joy that joy is far beyond anything satan says into the presence of god or it's going to take you somewhere you don't want to go as i said in in the early part of my ministry that doesn't change and as i read that first quote wherever you whatever you're doing in this life is declaring where your influences are coming from hallelujah if you're truly born again and you pass from death into life and your influences will be coming from heaven and you will reflect jesus christ in your daily warfare but if you haven't not yet had that experience passing from death to life they do not practice sin in the practice amen it doesn't mean they don't fall seriously it doesn't mean they don't come short but when they do they repent and they ask god to forgive them death can do uh pull you in or pull a believer into the presence of the maker that's the only thing that death can do some of these days death will and these were supernatural beings there was excuse me and there was a supernatural being waiting at my mother to give me life when i was born so if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved there is already and just as i've been the garden of the spirit here um and the spirit of god crying out abba father not only me but every person in the world in the grace of our lord jesus christ no in galilee hallelujah is that all right one of these days in galilee of god yonder somewhere i expect to meet him in peace i trust that he's the same with every one of you [Music] ought to see that people are you uh people all you're you're done lay right here this is what i'm trying to say excuse me i'm admitting some of it because i want to get back to it even these things memphis shows us satan sinners for eternity will be done away without [Music] and everything else it's gone it's the origin is a sign of sin [Music] the earth will be cursed [Music] [Music] nothing will ever touch that side yeah [Music] hallelujah like if anything is sterilized let them [Applause] you can't tell me you got to fire baptism and you still want to do evil he said oh you can be tempted but satan cannot hold you his husband one glorious plan of redemption and it's brought right into the bosom of god again so what am i saying in
