while I was in service so I don't want to forget maybe this week if if it's work with everybody's schedule I'll do a little Bible study at 11:30 at the house if that for the kids is that all right if y'all can make it and I'll let you know that we'll have some food too so if the sweeties want to bring their kids you welcome to my house at 11:30 Monday through Friday okay amen I'm on my way because II [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah before we take our seats let's open our Bibles to Matthews I'm going to read from three places Matthew 27 John 19 and first John chapter 5 Matthew 27 that's one verse verse 15 I'll be brief right so let's pray before we read away pleasure Heavenly Father want to thank you that indeed you have shown that you'll never be without a witness even in this city you have a remnant that I call by your name that are looking forward for your soon appearing that we shall become like you we want to thank you now the word is committed back into your hands you are the author of this word we pray O God that you come and take the highest seat this evening in our miss now be the guest of honor for this meeting and come a minister to our hearts take man of the out of the way and Lord have preeminence tonight this we ask even in a mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen Matthew 27 I'm reading verse 50 fiftieth verse Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost let's move to John 19:34 just seen on the same subject John 19 was 34 I read a word of the Lord but one of the soldiers with a spear Pierce his side and forthwith came there out blood and war amen first John five mountains end of your Bible now John chapter 5 I read two verses verse 7 and verse 8 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and they are three that bear witness in it the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one amen may the Lord at his blessings to the reading of his word amen let's be seated beloved so as I said I want to remain on this subject of the new birth but I want us to look at another side of it our prophet William Graham said there is an approach and there is a process for this new birth to take place in us and I want us to look at this approach and this process that our prophet spoke about remember our ultimate goal amen is to be like Jesus to be like Jesus to be like Jesus I long to be like he that's our ultimate goal we want to be like Jesus pregnant when we become like Jesus would you don't worry any more about this world we think Jesus was concerned about the riches of this world he knew he had greater riches don't worry about becoming a billionaire and becoming and buying a 100 million jet because he doesn't want to fly in a tube of demons oh my god hallelujah brilliant sometimes I don't know but God always shows to us in very little things that with us and the problem is us it's not him the problem is us I remember I think about a year and a half or two years ago I wanted to I think about a year and a half I wanted to buy a suit in jankis and when I went the price I like the suit it's also nice but the price was way beyond a poor student like me that's 425 bucks so I just forgot about it so anytime I go into Yonkers I look at it admite when I said no these are not the kind of things I want to spend my money on so you know Yonkers is closing so I went back there to see how my dad suit was going for and they had so I asked them they tell a teacher I mean yeah yeah to check how I make the price was into a $75 that's a jacket so I bought it but in the store didn't have the pant and I just bought it by faith that I'll get a pan to match it isn't it so anytime I see younger someway I try to enter to see what I could see the part that would match it and I was not finding one so last week when we last two weeks when we went to Iowa City in between service I just Google to find out that I was a young cast in town and there was so I went there when I went I saw a similar plant but the size was not my sight was way smaller than me I couldn't wait that's okay I'll try again one day when I get to do morning I'll go to the Jordan Creek Mall and tried I want to so in between service to be awaited but in one of the walls I went they had given me the code as a code for all the items at the behalf so they had given a cool that I could look online or I could give it to somebody in a store to look for me so I always had it in my pocket so when I went to John actually I gave out a code they look into their system and it told me that uh what we have is very small and even what they had they couldn't see it on Iraq's I wanted to leave then something told me that look why don't you go such a bit so I went to one of these racks that they don't even sell the kind of things that I wanted I was just looking through in case somebody has picked it and put it there so as I was looking through something drop on the ground and when I look at it yeah it was I said Lord could this be you I mean in very little things if we learn to appreciate God in very little things you do bigger things for us isn't it so beloved we've been talking about the new birth and the need for us to come in contact with a living witness amen an angel came to camellias that was true but the angel directed him to Peter the angel did not plant a seed in him the Angels message that he brought to him did not give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost it had to take Peter to come to his house for Peter to speak the word to him anybody be living that way the Peter spoke receive the blessing of God in the form of the Holy Ghost amen now I said in the morning that you can come across and living witness you can come across a career of viable seed but if the ground or witness is planted is not good that's it major minute but Cano grew the seed may not germinate at all and we know that from basic science it meant that if you go and put seed on a very poor soil it--my germinate all right bite can never bear fruits so just with our way that is why in agriculture we try to march soils and a kind of cross that can be grown on Sol's so beloved sees the fall in the Garden of Eden God has used every type Arana to show us that only a new birth can change our evil nature it meant as I said in the morning Christ came and diagnosed the problem he said hey Nicodemus the problem is your bed I mean it's not it's not in a Bible that way but that is a that is what he was trying to tell him say the problem is the way you were born right now it's not your fault the problem is the way we were born that is the perverted way because every original is God's poking way everywhere now his gospel he knew a God from the beginning God spoke everything into existence all right so it's not our fault that we were born that way but God has a provided way it is our fault problems is our fault when we refuse to take the provided way God has a way of escape for every for mankind let me put it that way so it is now your fault if you refuse the way of escape I gave this example before in this church when I preach some time ago that according to the history when Jesus was departing he told the disciples that it will not be long the abomination spooky of Daniel will be studying the holy place when they see it they should flee amen so the way of escape for the disciples in Jerusalem is to run away not to stand and fight or pray just run away it's all right so when titles in AD 70 or so they're about when he surrounded according to josephus history not a single Christian died because they heeded advice of their Lord they ran away by the priests they went and entered the temple and was calling on the god of Moses they're very good at crucified on the cross to come down and save them so brethren God always has what a provided way he has a way of escape so sister if we don't choose that way of escape and you choose your own way rather if you choose your own way then the fault is no Maurice as for the way you were born into this world there was nothing you could do about it you didn't choose it so God is not going to judge you for that but he's going to judge you for refusing he's provided way and as I said in the money he has one provided way he has one why did we so very since therefore what he has been trying to do is to restore us back to the original nature from which we have fallen ready if it took a bath for us to adopt this corrupt nature they must take a bath again to go back to that nature of God as iris hallelujah beloved all nature is testifying of this new basis all nature the sunday see bra bra was using the Sun to type in say look in the morning look at the Sun it's like a toddler struggling - best for by 11 o'clock it's it's in its teenage years by midday strong man with all the power I mean I always tell people that I mean I don't know what's making this sound but if that's where we are getting our power from I mean that's put a little generator here to give you some electricity makes all the noise but look at the Sun the greatest generator we have so empty teens make noise when a Sun is so great its shine is like a cool across the whole entire globe we're not making any noise great teens empty vessels vessels make it a lot of noise you know great things don't make noise hallelujah hallelujah so sometime when I see preachers who are struggling to be seen to be known they are the deep ones I know that in fact they are empty because a good one will humble himself and just sit there when the time comes then what is in him will be made known is that is that it hallelujah so by two o'clock the Sun is becoming an old man stooped then it goes down by 6 o clock I mean of call here the Sun in the somehow good around 9 o'clock 9:00 p.m. but is that the end of the Sun it to rise up again the following morning it's showing the Beth hallelujah death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ amen every day is showing that and all nature is showing that look the grain of corn for rich to reproduce is Safari to live again we know it has to fall into the soil it has to rot it has to die before our life comes out but even when our life comes out it doesn't look like the thing that went into the soil but eventually it becomes a thing that went into the soil is all right right so all nature is testifying of this bed and for me in the Old Testament Solomon said the conclusion of the matter in ecclesiastical center that what we said the conclusion of the matter is that for me the conclusion of the matter is to be born again and received a baptism of the Holy Ghost that is all what Christianity is about it's not about reciting some Creed and some special prayers offered for you and some incense band so that when you die your soul is in peg a trick I move from purgatory to I don't know where to wear it away it's not about that it's just about being born of God the nature of Christ be formed in you and you receiving the promise but ISM for service Alleluia even Bob ROM was using the death of a bill and the Beth of set to testify to show that it is a new best to show that it's only a new bed that can correct our evil nature hallelujah so the process of being born again starts with death easy no string that Beth Sharada start with death look problem again use this illustration preaching up preaching in beyond the catching of time he said when the baby is in the womb of death of the other mother now when the baby is born on earth here what has actually happened to the room where the baby was was that the baby has died to DA room but death there is not end of the baby has been born into a world here all right the same thing happens when we physically also die here on this earth when we die we are we are I mean the people here who know more see us but we have been born into another world you know that so the process of birth actually starts with death the only way physically even if you I believe I physically the only way you can be born into God's kingdom you can enter into that dimension it's where you have physically disappeared from this world when you are deck and go on that is a nothing when we go to bury you we have buried the flesh but your spirit your soul goes back to its big eyes all right good so the process of death death starts with death I remember when I went to Canada one of our ministers lost a brother very helpful brother to the church and I went there to preach and I took that title death is better I was using this to illustrate it look look at the Trish every every winter it died isn't it by the end of the trees by the following winter but you know that there are some trees that Dinah winter the neva resurrect in in the spring it shows you is that one is in nature is teaching us everything is telling you that there are some people who die and when they do I mean they can be part of the resurrection that we are going to be part of when they die they have died and do die again if I can put it out you know you and I saw what I'm talking about at the same time there are some trees that do not die in the winter they evergreen and that's also teaching you that there is an eternal life somewhere there is something that does not die hallelujah amen so all nature has been exemplifying that Santa must die for you to leave or something must die for another to leave now if you go to the world I don't know which in Africa we have lions we have leopards we have highness we have all these wild cats and dogs in the world for them to be able to leave a buffalo has died and antelope has to die something must die for them to leave is that right here you have your jug ways you have you have some mountain lions and all that they have to eat a bison the after each the deer they have to eat something for them to leave hallelujah so something major is always showing that that something has to die before something can leave even those who claim to be vegetarian by Brahma said you those who claim to be vegetarians do you know that the vegetables that you eat to is life that is dying for you for we human beings who live something we have to buy some the meat we buy from the shops is the fish that we buy it was life that has been killed for us who eat to give us life why is it so it is so because that is the law of God I am following the law of God is that something has to die for something to live so if we take tomatoes is life that seed in that tomato is life by you kill it put it in me put it in stew or make soup I brought with it and you are killing it once you go to that process it can live again but when you kill it you consume it then you you live is that right so brethren we for us to be born against something or for us yeah for us to be born again for us to receive that new bed something had to die for us and that is what the Lord Jesus Christ came indeed he had to die for and also that is the law you know the disciples probably didn't have all this understanding at the time that Jesus Christ was telling them that he was going to die and I mean all the parables and he was talking about and rise up again on the third day and peeta or rebuke him and say no you are not going to die because he said if I mean the grain of wheat if unless it enters into the soil it abideth alone if it does not get into the soil it can't reproduce hallelujah so for Christ to produce many Christ it has to fail died then when he died when he died then he came back into the disciple in an outpouring of the Holy Ghost then he reproduced himself in them that is the law of nature is alright okay so like this let's start now we've laid the foundation so I want to start by reading something that Barbara said in you must be born again in paragraph 68 he preached a sermon you must be born again and I like that same all the way he said you must be born again see he was talking to somebody the title see I like the way the Prophet pick his titles that title itself is a message on his own say you must be born again Amen hallelujah he said and look did you know it day something has to die so that you can leave now to use seventh-day Adventist that is in our miss many people say I wouldn't shoot a squirrel Rob Rahab I wouldn't kill a deer or a rabbit fish cause I don't believe that we should kill things my brother did you know that the vegetables and things that you eat is life also you have to kill it and the only way that you can exist in this life something has to die so you can live by is dead life now if something has to die so you can live by is motile life here on earth to live mortally did not something have to die so that by is life you could live eternally did not something have to die for us to have eternal life if mortally physically for our bodies that will soon their rotten and be buried in the dust and for these bodies to live some pepper some onion something has to die then for you to live eternally for you to have eternal life Tina has eternal life has to die for you did you get it Oh hallelujah just ask yourself that question and that one was Christ because no other one it has immortality the only one that has immortality is Jesus Christ hallelujah so the only one that can give you that immortality is Jesus Christ that is why he had to go to the grave that is why he had to lay down his life on the cross hallelujah the son only has immortality and he gives himself to you by just as setting him hallelujah so brethren we say that the process of being of this new bed amen oh the approach where and said I approach this new bed is first what dying first death variant unless we die Christ cannot be in us you see maybe I should have gone back to talk a little bit about able nature by struggle but listen when we were born something took over our souls the very day that we were born that nature of the serpent came into us that is why we can't live a godly life by ourselves there is no body the only person who has ever done that on earth is the Lord Jesus Christ you know Bella brown struggles how own him his own he would have done many things against them the Word of God at 8/7 the angel said don't drink don't smoke don't defy your body because when you are older we are going to be useless I mean there's a way for you to do hallelujah but even without warning as he grew up into his teenage years on his own you would have done it his first girlfriend I went out with and a girl was smoking you remember I can't say you you don't smoke you don't smoke you don't do anything so how do you entertain yourself robber I want to prove that he's a man pick the secret and wanted to like it but I knew the angel of the Lord one do not allow that because his body was going to house Christ his body was the temple that God was going to use for this end time so God didn't want that him put defiled so God Himself will come down and that sound and that's how he I mean even the fathers whoever I was working for the whiskey man Rob ROM fetching water I said but my son doesn't drink is a fallacy where I've got a as a son I wanted to prove that he was not a you know that was like some an insulting language to be describing that you are like a woman today it's pride for men to be totally a woman they even like it we have accepted it can we watch hallelujah so beloved as I said only one person ever leave that sort of life where he was born and by his nature he never desired foreseen and I was Allah Jesus Christ the reason why he could live that way is because he was not born through sex that's the only reason why he could live that way if he had also been born like any of us he couldn't have stopped it but see LeBron put it this way said we skipped out you funny so we cannot see back into eternity and see the glory we have with a lot from the beginning we skip it to come to this world to be tempted but Jesus Christ in his skin is so funny he could look back he knew the glory he had with a father from the beginning so this well it affects didn't matter limine but we have to skip it so that we can be tempted because our mind is darkened to our past glory with the Lord remember when God was talking to job and God said job where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy you remember that yeah we had we see we we had glory with him you know but we had to come to this world to pass through this because if no God would not be God rom made us to know that God has attributes in him because if there's nothing laws to be saved he can't be known as a savior amen if there's nothing to be redeemed how will he be known as a redeemer how he be known as a he life there's no sickness for him to heal amen so so to be born again we must go through this process of death amen the same as ever sister Sarah Berggren say yes to be born again you must go through a process of death he said everything does you take a grain of corn if that corn ever expressed to live again it's got to die fast hallelujah so my sister my brother if we want to live again we must die Fest will soon talk about how that deafies if a grain of wheat Allah expects will live again it's totally impossible for that corn laugh with that flower that tree that grass that vegetable everything that express to live again must die fests now how are you going to escape it you got to divest you got to die then the question died how when we say you have to die die ha to yourself die to everything so that you can be born again you've got to do that if you don't die you can never live again and look did you know that day let me pick it from from 64 he said now they approach to this bed he said there is an approach to it and they approach this bed you have to go through a process just like anything that leaves I'm just emphasizing this for you to see anything that lives again has to divest and you cannot keep your same spirit sister brother you can't keep your arrogant spirit and say you are born again a spirit I reject everything that the Word of God says whenever of God says don't do this you go ahead and do it and you say you are born again you can see all those things I mean I'm here of all those is in a radio on the televisions and all those things are there everybody claims to be born again but you look at the person standing even the way he has dressed shows that he's against God's Way the way she has read shows that she's against God's Word and yes he says is born again hi Dean has served behind layers of makeup a sieve to cheat mother nature simply don't grow old again and yet they claim that they are born again that's cannot be born you can't keep that old spirit and say you are born again the spirit has to die you can't keep down all desire and say you are born again that old desire has to die well a sister you can't keep your own thinking that's a problem everybody want to reason out the message everybody wants to reason out the Bible you can't keep your own reasoning and be born again you have to die to your reasoning if you reason it that is even a making hallelujah so you say and you cannot keep your self you cannot keep your same habit our filthy habits have to die hey those hobbies don't die we can't be born again it has to die amen you've got to die on his altar like a bell did with his lamp you've got you've got to die with your lung you've got to die die to your own thinking I like this one he said die to your own thinking and that is everybody is having his own interpretation of the one message that came to us problem said don't interpret it so if you interpret it you go far away from the beaten path but I like typology I like taking things from the Old Testament and type in it because the Old Testament is a type of the new and the old and the New Testament is a type of today but I want to stay where the Provost eat I don't want to venture into picking an 18 and making some type typology for people to see how deep I am in the word when the prophet has not touched - then I'm interpreting the word I am NOT a revealer of the way the revealer of the word came to us in the person of William my own Brown because the word of God comes to a prophet it doesn't come to the faithful ministry comes to a dispensation now prophet so just till when a prophecy hallelujah amen so brethren we have to die to our own thinking to be born to his thinking oh I like that one let the mind I was in Christ be in you you've got to think his thoughts and now brother sister let me say this as intelligent as I know how to see how can you think his thoughts and deny his waking amen how and yet claim you are born again just ask yourself that question how can you do it you can't if you are you are born again you've got his thoughts if the mind of Christ is in you there you are a new creature so this is what I'm try to see that the mind of Christ to perform in a believer means that that believer has to die to his own thinking don't question it if broblem said that if that TV set was in my room I'll pick my shotgun and shoot it don't question it oh we are in a modern world how can I live without a television it's as plain as plain can be if God came down into low profit I don't own one we say oh by now you have all these you have internet and if you have even this you can have a TV on your you don't control what comes on the TV do you but if you have internet you contribute can't control what you want to see on the internet but on the TV you don't control all this put on the TV so that's the way the prophecies so die to your reasoning die - you're thinking don't reason it no reason it hallelujah he said as I know how to say how I've said the Bible teaches that if any brother would like to well you find that creature look that word creature in the lexicon and you find out that the word creature there is interpreted or translated as new creation because you are a one creation a human being born in sexual desire here on earth and now you a new creation born by spirit your own thoughts are dead they are so dead until they are crystal either brass serpent you see let me let me say this when Barbra ham was preaching on the seals when he got to the fifth seal the source under the altar rom said there may be many among you who may think about this thing differently from from me of differently from the way I'm about to say it but I also thought differently to see Barbara was always very careful to point to as the human part of him so that we don't dfi him the human part of him I talk about it differently when he was where he was preaching when he was going to preach on the first seal he said he went and took all the old teachings of that meat and all these Oh horse Kofi's said hurt the talents I said and all he gathered them together I had prepared we've got previously I'll be saying that a white horse rider was a spirit of God or the Holy Spirit that went out in the face a to conquer then at midday the pillar fire came into the room my bra was careful to tell us that so when a pillar of fire comes to correct him on that he can still know to his own thinking his thinking's have thinking has to die for the last thinking to take over and this one this what I'm trying to say that we have to die to our own thinking when a prophet comes and said that say the Lord don't under I was looking on the Google Earth on my iPad and I was looking at Los Angeles and I was looking at the Salton Sea then I measured it 200 kilometers he's the Prophet said that Los Angeles will be believed the Salton Sea and I'll ask but Los Angeles was so close his oak is on the Pacific Coast so it would have made more sense for it to be sinking into the Pacific Coast is indeed by the prophet of God said the Salton Sea and I just take it as the Salton Sea I'm not going to reason it there right why there are things that in iodine the message which are not doctrina maybe slip of tongue the provide want to say 5000 and 7000 or something like that those are those that's what I'm talking about but thinking about things that have come does sear the Lord things that have come as doctrina teaches you don't pick it and reason it out you know you know the prophet of God spoke against mixed marriages you know that but it is very easy for somebody who I mean all these anti racism movements I don't have anything against them all these anti racism movement is very easy for them zero that's wrong he's to see that and say he's a racist you know that you'll see that I say the prophet of God is a racist why is he seeing a black I know Mary white why is he saying that but I would take the profit at his weight I don't care how logic or reason he sees that's what we are supposed to do if somebody doesn't know it and that's it that's different I'm talking about those who know it I'll take him at his word because I know those who do not know it and even do it there's a pattern for them in a message marriage and divorce so brethren there are many things that I in the message that are in the word that would be contrary to our thinking that are completely contrary to our thinking but if it is the Word of God and you are born again you can't denied you receive it and I will receive every bit of it if I don't know it and I do it ignorant I know God will forgive me even but I don't know the word and not against it and say I'm born again hallelujah so Gregory listen clues for Allah to live and reign forever he himself has to die now if the bridegroom had to go through that the process of death for him to reign forever eternally then shooting the right also go through that now talking about the church now another individual talking about a church even if you look at a church the church also had to go through death and resurrection you know the bride that was Beth at Pentacles she died at service or our pajamas or by pegye Macias hybridize and by the Dark Ages that Sedition age she was dead then she rose again in ty Tyria Philadelphia Bob rancid I was a stock is that right Letitia was what the shock and now the bride is on earth now being prepared by the Word of God for his soon coming there right so just as the groom had to go through that process of death to live forever the bride also has to go through that process of death to live again girls order does not change so the church goes through that the same way the individual bride also has to go through that very unless we die to our thinking unless we die to our reasoning Christ cannot be forming us even and if Christ is formed in us hallelujah we will leave him out you can hide it you will leave him out it will be seen of men I don't know why right was this man who said o TL Osman who said we preach Christ but Brahm lived Christ yeah he was seen that he lived Christ he didn't just talk about it or he talked about he lived it ma oh what a sweet word we are following Amen so brethren we have to die that's the first approach now let me give you something else from the message leadership he said the first kind of which the bridegroom how to fall into the F in order to rise again the right so did the first bride that was born at Pentacles had to good to the duck it is like any other seat the barrack they had to die they must do it but it started sprouting again all right so that's what I was trying to talk about when you when you see into the wheat when it comes for the corn of wheat a man's does raise quit you go out and see that with form in there it looks just exactly like the grain if you take a tweezer and set down and take that wheat and open it up there is no grain there at all see it sounds like cone maybe we are no use which in area where I used to count you see that Cobb has come loose but go cut it the corn is not from yet is that right only the shock has come and that is what deceived the people when the Sousa Street revival came they thought that that was the promised outpouring of the Holy Ghost and let me say this let me drop this many endtime churches are still living under the Azusa Street and nineteen and thinking that that is the promise egg time holy goes for Russia there is a difference God did send the Pentecostal revival our eyesight was the work of God it was God's Way of preparing the people to receive His Messenger you see barometer how could that have been the promised outpouring when the teaching rain has not yet come when the people have not been taught to align themselves properly when they had women preachers all over when they were baptized him baptizing people in the titles of Father Son Holy Ghost when they were they were taking the loss of ours I don't know how to call it a lost breakfast how could I have been the outpouring of the Holy Ghost that wasn't but they confuse themselves they totally already had it so when problem came and was telling them that one by Brahms say look we hardly have faith enough for even to cure haddock how can we have him fit for rupture they totally got it to a self-deception hallelujah to a self-deception so bearing the seed that went into the ground comes back again amen when Christ died on the cross now to my scriptures so that went down when Christ died on a cross from how we read treaties came out of him in Matthew 27 verse 15 it talks about the blood and the water in John 19 it talks about the spirit amen then in 1st John the treaties were put together day that they are three that testify in heaven and there are three that testify on earth they treat our testified in heaven I want the three that testify on F agree in one the water the blood and the spirit now listen this is what I want to bring across now remember that the first bride that was ever given to the man in the Garden of Eden was taking from his side the right so God made Adam to fall into a deep sleep and gore performed the most complicated surgery that was ever performed he took the woman out of his and there is he did that was so that the woman could be like the man that is why when Adam saw the woman and I've said this is bone of my bone this is flesh of my flesh and we know that onto the for eve was almost it was co-equal with Adam there was nothing like this is what man can do this man should do this all human she do they were co-equal I normally say that it was like a type of what they thought Lucifer was with God in the heavenlies labrum say he was co-equal with God it was only in creation God was had otherwise was co-equal God that's how God elevated him but a time kid I wanted to be elevated even higher than God didn't Barham say say to us that the seven things that must happen before the end of the world I think they enlisted him a change is I think the fourth thing was about woman isn't it he said they were giving barb Ram said and I was inventing that it read I said that can ii can imagine that when women did not have all the power that they have to be he said they were giving more than equal rights more than it not equal right you more than that it's not fighting for equal right and they have more than equal rights any man who has gone through a divorce who tell you that they will take everything are you away from you and give to them si it always happens I don't know why even when it is clear that you you won't do things by yourself they take it away and give it to then they have more than equal right so many of them now that's all they want marry a rich man after ye have one of my friends married and within less than a month they got divorced I said also marriages this the married and within a month they got divorced there are people who marry within a week they get divorced hoping Brown had lived under these conditions look was he passed I was then look at the Oh peaches the woman were dressing very decent from what I see there was dissin seen everything everywhere but here Brian was crying about the amour addressing see he was a prophet you could see what was how it was coming on and that's what he saw in me because he saw it in a vision he said the last picture he saw was just a little thick April that was covering only their private parts today's Oliver look if this world should continue for the next fifty two hundred years women are going to walk naked on the street and a lawyer is not going to do anything about it they can wear all those there are things that away in the summer the ones that run through here they can wait and go anywhere nobody everybody thinks it's normal but I'm sure if that man dresses that way they will say that is he the man is mental when the woman dresses that way it's normal and I'm gonna invest the campus and it's West day and the professor's can say anything about because you say they'll say you are intolerant it's crazy everything has gone completely confusing so brethren when Adam saw Eve he said this is born of my Buddhist is flesh of my flesh for she was taken out of a man hallelujah so very the same way Christ in looking for a bride for himself that bride has to be taken from his side and that is why he was pierced on covering for the blood the water and the spirit to come out amen and Ramon said these three things that came up from him are the three elements that make that can make a bride for him the water the blood and the spirit these are the three things the three element that will produce a bride for Jesus Christ and when those treaties truly produce a bride for Jesus Christ that bride would be exactly like him Peres in Revelation the Bible says that the woman has made herself ready so I don't care what anybody says what is important the one of those is that she has made herself ready it means there will be a bride for Jesus Christ the whole world can decide to go mad like they are going now our politics can decide to be in total confusion like it is now I don't care about that what I know is that there will be a bride for Jesus Christ that cannot reach Jesus Christ will have his bride in can never change and he said he's coming for a bride without spot or wrinkle so if you if you say you are a member of the bride I have to check your life you think what is coming to come for you in your spotted and wrinkle state he doesn't want any bride with sports and with wrinkle when rom went to glory what was the age of those people that I saw they said they were between 18 and 21 he's all right I don't want a bride with spot or wrinkle but look at the people call himself recess today and all of them have hope to be going errata they say it's from the Hat I don't know whether they said I hear to him in my country they say it's from the heart it doesn't care it doesn't matter what you wear it doesn't matter how your outward looks like wow how are you going to know a tree is it nobody fruits it's by the fruit I know every tree where a sister I don't walk around with an x-ray machine to exer your heart to see what is in your heart I can only know what is in your heart by the fruits you are bearing by your outward appearance that's the only way I can know what's in your heart yeah when people tell me lies in the heart I say hey I don't carry an MRI or a CT scan in my hand just to scan your heart to know what is inside the only way I know what is inside our heart is what you look like if you paint yourself like a caricature with all these tattoos that are coming up now almost every what did you see in Tana has stuck to the body what is that what is that - we shouldn't go into things like that look at the spirit all the time thank God I'm black if a tattoo he doesn t need to be seen I I don't know I I don't know where this is coming from every decent person you see now V people you know expect them they all have something written on their bodies piercing every part of the body spirit is this that's why Brahma you see Abraham is a black monster Brad Bram that problem if God doesn't punish this generation and look a legend recently we're talking about to the generation of the 50s and the 40's will look back and said I was a decent generation as compared to the one in which we were living me that's why I told you in the morning every generation gets further away from the truth look at a generation and they were in and yet they said if God didn't punish that generation cobra to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah but I know that there's a remnant of God people on earth God is only waiting for us to call get into the act for him to shut the door then he can bring the ring because I mean this filthiness cannot continue I don't know how long this thing is going to continue people are not satisfied anything that God has given them they change everything or has given all the natural is chained to their natura and it is in their own natural that they feel satisfied god have mercy God have mercy all these athletes all these post people they paint their body there were wild haircuts hair do's men with earrings nose rings mouth rings I don't know we part of the body they don't PS anymore if they had their own with it appears the Hat and put a ring on a hat oh my god so brethren Abraham said the elements that we need for a new bed amen was given to us on covering when Jesus shed the blood that wara and let out the ghost these are the three things that has to prepare a bride for him amen and let me read you how Rob Ron put it as I went down in the message beth pain i think so okay let me take is this a science I know and said before I take birth pain alright paragraph 48 birthday and everything down first look when a woman or entity in travail for base the first thing that comes to pass the breaking of water and Norma Beth second team is the blood and then comes life it's all right what up blood spirit call life is a spirit all right I mean this is just housing just a kiss which which is holding the soul is alright in the spirit and that constitutes the normal natural death and so is it in the spiritual realm its water that's justification by faith believing on God and receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized as a warrior believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized that's the water second is scientific Asian of the Spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world that's what many believers are struggling with even from all from our elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives new birth and fills up that sanctified vessel hallelujah so the material the reason why Christ had to go to the cross is to allow the surgery that was performed on Adams side from the beginning to give Adam a bride to be performed again to give Christ the second Adam a break and just as the first bride fell the second the first bride fell the second bride to who for but this time she will resurrect hallelujah and claim her place as the bride of Jesus Christ amen so very fast death we have to die to our own thinking then go through the process of justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost then we are in his program now he can use us now we can leave their life where everybody who see us is he it's not something that you struggle to do is something that is has become your nature let me say this one brother who I'm told that since he was born he always wears shots he has never ever worn pants before and he was a heavy drinker so he has his gang he moves with his gang so he became a somebody brought him to church in one of my autistic he's in Ghana when he had a message said new this thing is different from all the churches I've been to this must be the truth so instantly everything every day when he comes to church and here's a message what about the message preaches against his closet so one day he traveled back to his home village immediately he learned that everybody knows that hey the guys can only have to go to the bar to drink and he went to him they realized I know it's not a guy we know because for the first time he came and he was in paint he was not in shots and they were also they all said no if this is true then we have to come to the church that you have gone to I know what happened within that shot up like three months that a brother came to believe immediately here is he received his baptism God took him away we go God knows that if he stays here longer the devil could take him back just go just took him when a bride has been born we know that Brown said that that happened when the file was the five stars also cross their paths said the bride has been born a bride in his infancy has been born god-like in the days of joke is looking down and asked him you and I because we didn't come to become the bride of this end-time by accident remember when Abraham said if you had opportunity to look down true glory and if God asks him in which age who does he want to come and be a preacher in on this earth you would have chosen this very last one and I believe that God put us here for that same purpose maybe Paul and Co could he have survived in this last age he knew that you and I can survive it that's why he put us here and we dare not disappointing beloved we have to die to our thinking we have to die to our reasoning we shouldn't we should start reasoning the Word of God we just have to accept it remember the process begins with death if we don't die to ourselves Christ can never live in us as the scripture said we can't serve two masters we can't we can be seven maman and serving God you can serve the world and save cracks it's not possible this holy service you become a hypocrite but there is a consolation as many as will as many as desire God is ready to make a way for you it's only you as I told you in the beginning about my testimonies only we that are limiting God in very little things God proves that his day it's true sometimes he allows you to go through the difficulty for you to to fight it out LeBron said if God were to push us through a tube and pull us on the other side then he cannot say that we should overcome so because mejor have you become you have to fight it out and I appeared honest I don't like you then you are triumphant then you are no vakama then you are qualified to sit with him on his truth because he also had to face it it's not it was an easy thing for Jesus to go to the cross brother because Jesus was fully a human being he was fully God the human part of him fought it that's why I said father if it were possible let this cup pass over me in Germany he preached his sweat became like glad you think if it was easy who have done that for all these people to be spitting on him and piercing him and punishing him amanda was born with our sin that cannot be to whom sim can never be imputed i had to go through that so that christ will be formed in us even doing because of himself really because of you and I it's up to us do we want this better do you want him in us we want him to detect our life I want to live in the way we think is right LeBron was so much surrender to the Spirit of God that many a time the spirit will let him to do things that are against his own reasoning you know when the when the blizzard was focused in Colorado and he was walking down the hill and the spirit said go back it'll make sense I'm not saying gold listen to me you and I we are no profits so don't go listening to any spirit to speak to you just listen to the way so and even if something speaks to you compared to the way do you know how around it when he had a voice he said he closed his mouth put his tongue in between his teeth to be sure that were I he's not speaking to himself oh that's I said as the same voice that spoke to him since he was a child the voice has never filled so even the Prophet had checks and balances to be sure that our Scott but in this believer if he sees a light flash across the room does he subscribe you see some darkness than sittin I mean we have all manner I have one of my pastor friends in Ghana when we are walking in he knocks his leg against something his ghost we came to him if it's the right leg he has a mean if he's the left leg it doesn't mean she didn't go into that all we have to do is to take the wedge and leave by the way that's all human beings always are looking for sighs I just want to say the evening by Abraham when God speaks to him he makes sure that it is God the Lord is are you the creator of the heavens and the earth go back there whatever you ask to be done he spoke and Iblees are cleared power of the spoken word so even the profit had to make sure that what he was hearing was from God how much less us tribuna feet feeling so much better talking about these gluey feeling so much better talking about surely God is good to us feeling so much better amen surely the Word of God speaks for itself for himself amen will appreciate the Word of God another masterpiece amen you know it's amazing because often time we have a tendency of not knowing the scripture and sometimes reading reasoning with ourselves right and we will always do that until we realize what a true vindicated prophet is because when a man or woman comes to understand what a true vindicated prophet is he has no words coming he has no thought coming because God takes those thoughts of his himself and what he wants to speak he puts it in the mouth of a prophet and a prophet speaks his word his thoughts is that right amen and oftentimes I found like out like this when you find you wrong the only thing you can do is repair and thank God for giving you repentance and there are things amen that we have done and things that we have not understood and we still did it amen but when God gives us space to repent the wisest thing is to do is to repent you might not even be able to change your situation but you can surely repent and ask God for forgiveness and then your children you teach them correctly so you and I must understand by the grace of God you know even as a pastor I pass it for years before I fully understood who we and Brandon was I thought I knew I thought I understood I believe this message but yeah I still have my own thoughts but you got to learn that when this message call me it doesn't need your addition or your subtraction you take it for what it's worth amen only us only you you know the bride we'll do it that way yes Lord even though she may not understand like Mary law I have not known a man how can this thing be nevertheless let it be according to your word so we thank God for the message we thank God for the Word of God I you know I say amen to truth amen and everything I heard tonight was true and I still say amen you know God is real to us I am so happy to be part of the bride of Jesus Christ amen God show you things he men and you don't even understand what he's showing you a showing to showing you amen until like like I prefer the Torah preach the other day to prophecy and time meets amen we so thank God we have been so blessed amen the Word of God coming to us you know but the bride of Jesus Christ she wants true and no matter what it is amen we know by God's grace everything that has been said this evening has been true so we just thank God for being merciful to us you know gracious to us and given us a time where we can just move forward in God because true truly people the statue of a perfect man is not setting up on top of that wall over there that little image of that it's not just sitting there for you to look at it in mire the colors and that is something that must be produced it must be produced in us whether we like it or not it must be produced in it so we thank God for His grace anybody desire prayer or anything we thank God for just everything if this whole surface whole suddenly has been just wonderfully man you know just like a brother Isaac said that God will come down and speak just nobody's Amen people we don't wait you know I I was telling somebody out there ya know what I said think I'm about about the best dress in my congregation it's not that I want to be you know I you know God when I try to get what a ridwana suit somebody else give me another one sir but I think I'll for the brother's testimony amen I don't mind you know someday I'm gonna shock y'all I'm coming without a tie and everything man so don't reason why I do this because in case visitors come they you know but you never know how people think nowadays I don't know but you know and brother Brown said if God was a militant if he came in this day he would wear a suit so that's what I do what I do amen it's not because I so love fashion but we so thank God you know I do like to look nice and I mean it's okay yeah I got a little bit of Solomon in me but you know I so think I'll think about the people of God that God will take every one of us and all of us are hybrids you're not isolated every one of us are hybrids half beast and half man that's what it is none of us can escape except by in way of the blood of Jesus we were all born alike now amen two peas in one pot all sinners amen saved by the grace of God and I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm so glad that the blood of Jesus Christ is able to make me whole some of y'all should have been shouting about now but that's all right it's true you can't allow you know you know a lot of time when the Word of God come don't let the devil make you think that God is picking on you or the preacher picking on you what God is doing he's giving you grace I think I love brother I love brother Vince and I appreciate him you know I love his demeanor I just love how he he just stands solid you know it's just something about him that I've always loved and admire and I appreciate his ministry I just so think I'll thank you brother for allowing God to use you today amen I always think off for brother Troy you know we got two different gifts but you know they always feed me we're two different she'll save an amen but I love the way they cook it up you know amen come give us a song or so brother will be this myth I just all need to be let a man preciate you Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now but now please start us again Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved how precious did that grace appear the hour I first called and I have already kissed breathe has brought me see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] our Oscars hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah amen you may be dismissed thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]
