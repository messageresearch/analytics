song as a beautiful song and young to me every time I sing that song I I always have in mind that that song ought to be sung with a heart of faith amen because if we're gonna ask the Lord to draw me near there's got to be a faith behind that request a man so that if you ask the Lord to draw you nearer there's gotta be a faith there to know that you're going to be drawn here Amen there's gotta be something inside of you that says that because this came out of the mouth of a son or a daughter of God it's got to come to pass it's got to happen it's gonna it's gonna come on right down right on right on right on down the road I'll be drawn closer to the Lord a man because a child oh God about the request amen he put out his needs put out his the desire of his heart that he be drawn closer to the side of the Lord amen and then what God brings the response is sure enough signal on Sunday yeah be a full expectation to come Monday morning you're just gonna be drawn that much closer to the floor otherwise why did we sing the song in the first place amen every time we sing that song I have our lips we've got to have that expectation that's going to come to pass it's gonna happen hey man why because the bride requests the bride put out the request and now it's gonna come to pass Amen that says I just I love that about that song maybe a let's just says we stand we're gonna open in our Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 it's good to see everybody here in the house of the Lord this morning hey man God was a good God isn't he a man will read revelations chapter 3 start with the fifteenth verse speaking to the Laodicean church and it says I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth amen let's just stop right there will bow our heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your word it's eternal and true father Lord we give ourselves over to you this morning father we lay open our hearts to you father we put our lives upon the altar this morning Lord or we give ourselves to you this service Lord is for us father for you and for us Lord to join closer together as we open up the door and open up our hearts for you to come in father have thine own way this morning Lord speak to us however you will Lord we'd give ourselves to thee and we thank you for Lord work or an expectation to hear from your word because of your promise that you gave unto us and then we hold that promise and we say it's yes send a man to it and the name of Jesus Christ we thank you lord for all things and when your name we pray amen amen god bless you be seated I preached a message this morning called lukewarmness Amen lukewarmness as it's just a subject that has been on my mind and as I was reading about it thinking about it praying about it that word lukewarm is the only place and all the scriptures that shows up there was right there where he's prophesying about our age that's amazing thing that here when he they go to prophesy about our age he has to come up with a new word that's not necessarily a new word or a new topic or a new subject but the word lukewarm was not just doesn't just mean room temperature you know because many things are room temperature but they're supposed to be room temperature you know we we come into this room here we don't expect it to be hot or cold in the sanctuary here but we expect it to be room for temperature right right in just of that comfort level not too hot not too cold and some of us you know we feel their Commission kick on you might think my I'm starting to get a little cold or if it gets a little stuffy in here like my I wish it would kick on I'm getting a little hot amen but when it gets to be just right you say it's room temperature you know seventy-two degrees or whatever your comfort level is amen and maybe for those that are up north might be a little bit different temperature range and those from from the southern climates but but it's all right around in that human comfort range amen and you know but but the word lukewarmness doesn't have to do with the word room temperature even though they really kind mean similar things because the word lukewarm has to do a something that used to be hot it's something that is supposed to be hot but somehow over the process of time something has happened to allow it to go from hot to begin to cool Amen it's not supposed to be in that condition Amen because this you know like this room here it's supposed to be room temperature in here we have systems in place to control the temperature in this room so that so that if it gets too cold in here we can heat it up if it gets too hot in here we can cool it back down but but with the word lukewarm it doesn't have to do with room temperature it's something that is supposed to be hot that has now begun cool off a man as the what the word of this age the he could the the best word that God could think of to describe this age is he we really thought how do I want the prophecy of this age to go out and he spoke out that word thou art lukewarm that is the description of the Laodicean age that we were living in is that the church has become lukewarm she should be hot she should be on fire for the Lord God has now shown so much his expression has gone so far he has shown so much of his marvelous works so much of his marvelous grace so much of his love towards the towards the children of men God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for her to cherish her to love the bride and to and to draw her run to his precious site but in the midst of all that you know the church begins to cool off and becomes lukewarm he says of every age of all the ages they prophesied every 7th age he says I know thy works every single age he makes that statement from the Ephesian age to the Laodicean age he says I know thy works and let me tell you right now that this morning God knows your works Amen God used that to tell the temperature of each age a mega s we're not saved by works but when God looks at the works that you are doing the things you are doing with all your might with all your willpower with all your perseverance what you're doing with all your zeal those are your works the actions that you take and you can use that he can see the temperature of the age and every age he says I know thy works I know what you've done with the spirit that has been given to you I know what you've done with the trials that come by your way I know what you have done with with the circumstances of the age that you're living it and he gets to the Laodicean age he says I know thy works and that you are lukewarm I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot and I wish you would be just one or the other a man he says but because thou art neither lukewarm there with our lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I am going to spew thee out of my mouth and he goes on to describe he says you have allowed the things of this world to come in the forefront of your mind and those things have cooled you off towards the gospel the the things of this world the entertainment of this world the easy living the the computer games and the the movies and the enjoyments of life and the fine things the vacations and the easy living and all those things the the jobs that we do are trying to earn more money and more money and more things instead of being as Paul told Timothy charged those that are rich in the things of this world that they become rich and good works and rich towards God amen they know why so if those things don't become a blinder towards you that you would cool off towards the gospel amen and really we as Americans have become rich in these things of the world amen it's a this is a quite a country to be lukewarm in amen it's very easy to be lukewarm in this country Amen it's easy to to to to relax and enjoy the works of your own hands and just forget all about the gospel and to just cool off and and forget the one as the founding fathers called it Providence I came up with this word of God called Providence and that's how they describe God because God had provided every need for them in this country amen is from sea to shining sea the the land was taking care of the people and they and they began to call God by the name Providence amen because God was providing for their needs amen and they and they instituted a a holiday in this country called Thanksgiving a man so that we can give Thanksgiving to the one that has given us and supplied all of our needs amen but as God said about the children is really says that when they got fat amen that's when they began to kick out against God that's when they begin to forget about their God that when what Israel began to become fat that's when they kick against their very maker amen but you know every Christian has a responsibility and even some more so in this age has a divine responsibility to fight against lukewarmness amen every believer every believer has a responsibility a great solemn responsibility in their own heart to fight against the evils of this age amen because let me tell you God is looking at your works Amen God is looking at what you do with your time what you do with your hands what you do with your mind Amen what you do with your thinking God is examining your works to see what man or a person you will be will you be hot or will you be cold or are you just going to let the lukewarmness of the age drift you away from Christ amen you know and every relationship has that potential of becoming lukewarm every relationship well there be a marriage relationship or a relationship at work you know or of just life in general your zeal towards life Amen that let potential for lukewarmness is always there I think about the a work relationship you know they they talk about how man he gets hired for a job or a woman gets hired for a job and they go into the workplace with a zeal you know and they're the new person in on the block you know and they and they go in there and they and they begin to they work hard but you know after five years six years seven years you know they talk about the seven year stretch of when you you hit that stretch that that employee has a responsibility to not just rest on his laurels as they say in the English language or not just take it easy I'll I've made it this far I remember when I got I got my the job I'm currently in that I I came in with law zeal and I I was wanting to learn all the ropes and I wanted to find out how everything worked I wanted to know exactly I wanted to know 200 percent of what I needed to know Yona I was opening all the books and I was reading through all the manuals and I was studying all the buildings I was responsible for and a man looked over me he says what are you doing you already got the job he said you've already arrived you've already made it you've already got the job why are you even trying to do any better or trying to be hard you're already getting the paycheck why would you strive for anything else oh it's just my nature I'm not here to be lukewarm I didn't come to this there has to be a little more you know I didn't come to my job to be a lukewarm worker I didn't come to rest that I didn't come to my marriage to be a lukewarm husband I didn't come to my God to be a lukewarm Christian that's not that's not who I am that's just not the person that I'm gonna be a man because there's something inside of me there is resolved to not allow myself to be in that condition and every single one of us has a responsibility on the inside of themselves in every relationship to do unto others as Christ would do unto you amen when it comes to your marriage when it comes to your job when it comes to your place here on the earth and when it comes to Christ himself to fight against that lukewarm us amen to where you think well I'm just going to relax and I'm not going to strive for this anymore oh we can always strive to do better be better amen to be what Christ has called us to be because the spirit of this age is worth fighting against amen the spirit of this age not just in the Christian life but in all things you're the Christian life should be in all areas of your life amen amen to him to fight against that in all areas of your life amen it ought to be that way that it's worth fighting against amen so when when it comes to the marriage relationship you know the you have the honeymoon and then you go on down here two years you have the children come into place then that that that husband that wife have a responsibility to each other to keep that spirit of lukewarmness away from them amen they have a responsibility of each other to keep the fire on the altar as they say Amen why because we know it the spirit of this age Satan goes as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and the spirit of this age is to roll you asleep into lukewarm in every area of your life to lull you to sleep and were lukewarm as' but there is going to be a people that will reject that it's been prophesied that there will be a people on this earth called the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and they will have within themselves the burning fire of the Holy Ghost amen it's that same fire that has been spoken of all the way from the pillar of fire upon the Tabernacle in the wilderness to a pillar of fire of our day amen as it's gone through every age pillar of fire is still here and it's still burning in the hearts of many men you know if you go to a restaurant and they and they bring you out a plate and it's you could tell it's been sitting around for a while since they cooked it and it's something that's supposed to be hot and now they bring it to you and it's already cooled off you wouldn't accept it amen you'd say I didn't come here for lukewarm food I came for food fresh from the oven a man neither is God going to accept lukewarmness from any one of us Amen God is not going to accept a lukewarm offering from any one of us Amen the fire has to be on the altar Amen when when a when a when a young Levite in the Old Testament was growing up to be a to become a priest as his father was a priest his grandfather was a priest as great-grandfather was a priest and they he he was growing up in the and me and the his father would teach him all the ways of the priesthood amen he said and he would then try to impress upon this young man the responsibility of being a priest and that responsibility was is that the people have to be able to come up to the door of the tabernacle with their sacrifice to have their sins taken care of amen and God has placed our responsibility on the priest to make sure that that is always possible a meant that there was always a fire upon the altar Amen that the tools of the sacrifices are always there Amen that there's always wood stacked up there amen there's got to be things taken care of if the the wood pile is dwindling down then the priest needs to go take care of that why because there's got to be fire on the altar so that so that the children of Israel could have their sins taken care of a man so is it true with the Christian there's got to be a fire upon the altar there's gobby wood and material burning material there so that when the Holy Ghost comes by he has something to light the fire of your heart a man and that comes by the reading of the gospel through the praising of the Lord through the washing of the water of the word amen it comes to reading your Bible it comes through worshiping the Lord your God a man I'm bringing to your remembrance the things that God has done for you it comes from rejecting lukewarmness Amen it comes from rejecting the spirit of this age which is lukewarm 'us amen that's how you keep the fire and altar trust me the Lord knows your works just as much as the Lord knows that high priests will that priests young priests work when he goes out to get the work he goes out to get the firewood he knew that priests works hey man there are stories the Old Testament times when the fire went out on the altar amen it wasn't supposed to be that way amen but the fire is supposed to always be on the altar so the people could have a place where they could come for healing so people have a place where they can come for deliverance so the people have a place like come and have their sins hey man jesus said whosoever sins you remit it will be remitted whosoever sins you retain to them everything the the Bride of Christ is the repository of the Holy Ghost upon the earth amen amen when when Solomon dedicated the temple he said Lord God I pray that if anybody come to this temple even if he'd be a stranger to the Land of Israel but if he comes to this temple and has respect to your sacrifice and respect to you I pray that you Lord even though he'd be a stranger that you Lord would hear from heaven and answer his prayer and thus in that temple of God is still here today the temple of solvent we are dedicated when we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we were dedicated the things of the past are behind us and Christ is ahead of us and when we dedicate ourselves under Christ we become a candidate to be the repository for the baptism of the holy ghost where the fire is supposed to be amen let me tell you every baptized Christian has a duty to be filled with the Holy Ghost so that the people this world have a place to come get their sins taking care of that they have a place where they can come meet the Holy Spirit where they have a place where there you can be healed though I can be delivered as the Lord Jesus Christ so that the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to bind up the brokenhearted to set the captives free the priest delivers to those that are lost and the Spirit of the Lord God is the one that is upon me and has anointed me to be this as soul as the spirit of living God now come to anoint you to be the same thing and let me tell you that God knows your works God knows your works hey man Jesus Christ came he was faithful to the anointing that was given to him amen but now the anointing is for you he said I know thy works amen and every single one of us God is watching those works you're not saved by that I works but let me tell you it's a great thermostat hey man there's a thermostat it's set for a certain temperature Amen what Sunday or a Friday night when I got home from work I walked into the house and it felt kind of cold in the house I was like it's doesn't feel right in here something's wrong in here is colder than it should be I went to the thermostat and someone had turned it all the way up to 75 degrees but the little reader says there's only 67 now let me tell you a proper thermostat there's two numbers on there there's the number that it should be and the number that it actually is those are the two numbers and let me tell you if your furnace is operating properly or your air-conditioner is operating properly those two numbers are supposed to match why because the number that your house is supposed to be the temperature is supposed to be at and then the thermostat says yes it is actually it the temperature is supposed to be and when those two numbers were or match then the equipment is working properly amen but I if I go up to that and it says 75 degrees is what's supposed to be but it says it's only 67 in here well that's an 8 degree difference I don't care how that thermostat has program there is nothing in that programming that's going to allow for an eighth degree difference Amen it's the same thing with this Bible there is nothing in this programming that will allow for that big of a difference amen let me tell you God knows your works amen he knows what his Holy Spirit is capable of because the Holy Spirit is the set point amen let me tell you the Holy Spirit is the number on the right Amen it's the number on the right Amen the number on the left is your works the things that you're doing here on the earth and he knows what you're doing amen because the equipment has to be capable to make those numbers match amen so I looked there was an eighth degree difference between those two numbers something was wrong the thermostat was telling my first in the basement you need to heat this house up you need to turn the fire on you need to turn the fire on and I went down there and there was no fire I took the covers off I could see where the little burners are where the fire is supposed to come out it's cold there's no fire in the tubes oh well there's the problem it's not running and you know what and I took a look and there's a little circuit board in there and it's flashing this flashing this flashing a little warning code in there and I I looked at it and all these these little numbers are on the circuit board and I like well I'll bet I can find out what those numbers meet and so I went I asked mr. Google what are these numbers mean and mr. Google told me what those numbers meant I saw I start taking a few things apart tonight and I cleaned some things up and I and I put things back the way they were and all of a sudden I hear this clicking and I start smelling some gas I hear this little torpedo-like engine clicking off as the gas starts coming out of the tubes and also I see a burst of flames and takes off work there was fire in the tubes and the house began to warm up about two hours later I walked by the thermostat and those two numbers were right on target the one match the other there is fire in the furnace again let me tell you if God knows your works the setpoint for your life is the Holy Ghost and we know what the Holy Ghost can do the Holy Ghost has come to this world to change things amen the Holy Ghost has anointed me to preach the gospel to the meat to open the prison to them that are bound amen to release those that are captive amen to that's what the lame might walk so the blind can see amen so though this is the poor that might receive Christ amen so those that are wounded they can bind up their wounds amen so I can be my brother's keeper the Spirit of Lord God is anointing me for this amen and I know I can look at my own self and look at my works do the works that I am doing in my life do they match the capabilities of the Holy Ghost because let me tell you God knows your works God knows your works he is looking the the angel is searching the camp he's looking at the bride because it's been prophesied that in the last days there will be a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ she will be without spot and she'll be without wrinkle amen she'll have oil in her lamp and should be shiny light all the way to the wedding amen that's her duty is to shine light all the way to the wedding according to Matthew 25 amen she has a responsibility to bear that light all the way to the way amen and let me tell you I've come to be about my father's business amen and and so of you amen amen I know thy works and I could see the temperature of your soul amen let me tell you if your works are dead I am not telling you to go out and work more you leave that for the denomination's a mint I am NOT if your works are dead I am not telling you to go out and do more work I am telling you to go meet the Holy Spirit of living God and spend some time face to face with him amen fall in love with Christ because that is your responsibility your responsibility is not to the world your responsibility is to Christ amen Christ will take care of the rest Amen your responsibility is to not be lukewarm towards the world but your responsibility is to watch your lukewarmness towards your husband towards your maker towards the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's your responsibility that's the responsibility of every true Christian amen - watch that temperature of her soul amen angel said I bring you tidings of great joy when Jesus Christ was coming on the earth is that what you told Mary is that what they told the the shepherds I bring you tidings of great joy I'm bringing you a message of great joy peace on earth goodwill towards men the heart of God is being open towards mankind what a promise amen amen David said he is the glory and the lifter up of my head but you don't have to be bowed down he is the glory and the lifter of your head a man you know I bring you tidings of great joy what causes joy in a relationship you know what really what causes joy in a relationship you know because you take a husband and wife and when they are sweethearts and they couldn't wait to get together they couldn't wait to spend time one with the other but you know when lukewarmness sets in all of a sudden that desire begins to drift apart really no longer have a desire to be one with the other you know there's still the same people but now a sudden there's a division there a separation there where they no longer care whether they spend time with each other or not there's no more joy in the relationship they men you know and really in all things in life you know you can get satisfaction out of doing things for yourself but really joy comes when someone does something for you that you couldn't do yourself and you can get you can be by yourself and get great satisfaction but joy really comes from something else that someone has done for you they may have some ability that God has given you or something that you are thankful for amen amen so is it true with with Christ and the bride you know that relationship there's got to be joy in that relationship you can't lose sight of the things that God has done for you a man win because let me tell you if you lose sight of the guy you have to bring up to her year remember it's constantly the things that God has done for you we're here to be thankful people amen recently at my work they they wanted to do a thankful Thursday thankful series on their Facebook page and so and so they're getting different employees each Thursday to be thankful and get a quote from them you know and what they're thankful for so they approached me and wanted to know if I wanted to be the thankful one for that Thursday say well I be easy I'm the most thankful guy in the company alright and sorry I wrote out my quote and I must say they added it quite a bit and yeah and they posted it on their Facebook page it's not quite where I wrote but it's got some of what I wrote in there but I if I told him I was like well he'll be easy I'm the most thankful guy in mind the entire company even because I know what my God has done for me amen I I know what my God is capable of I know that his mercy and Grace has shined upon me I know that his hand has been on me in my entire life I know that he has guided me every day of my life through thick and thin amen and maybe my own things in my life haven't always been easy but I know in whom I have believed in and I know what he is capable of amen I've committed things up into his hands amen I know that he has answered my prayers and that brings me joy amen that gives me a perseverance to keep the fire on upon the altar a man because I know in the future that more things are going to come down life's play you know more things are going to come down in your life's journey some good some bad but no matter what he is the glory in the lifter of my head a man he has brought me tidings of great joy that's not a cliche to me a mint a man yoen God wanted to have a capital city upon the earth he chose Jerusalem called it the city of peace and that's quite a name for God's capital he could have called it the city of power or the city of the burning fire or the city of the sacrifice for the city of the Lamb all those things we decide to call it the city of peace amen that's the God that's the the end result of of God's presence in the land was they bring a great peace in the city by not just talking about he didn't just name it after the process he named it after the end result that there'd be a great peace upon the land amen and you are that City Amen you are the New Jerusalem that has been builded as a place for the the presence of the Living God to dwell a man it's a city of peace by God says I know thy works amen and he's searching out the heart of every single one of us so I love about the story of Adam and Eve is God you know he he created Adam and and they decide he wanted Adam to be the one to name all the animals and so he gives Adam a promise he says I want you at him to multiply and replenish the earth or the Adam was all alone didn't Adam come or then God comes he starts bringing all of the animals across Adams field of view and as he miss her mister mister missus monkey walks by and Adam named zoomin and then mister missus elephant walked by and Adam gives him their name and then all the animals walked by and Adam begins realize I am alone it says and amongst all the animals that was not found to help me for Adam amen and so and so I'm after a they finish all that than God he still has to fulfill the promise that he gave to Adam to multiply replace here so he puts Adam to sleep amen and pulls out of Adam's side a rib amen and irony and you know he pulls out of Adam everything that Eve was Adam wasn't you know and but before that everything everything was in one a man but God came and he pulled out of Adam half of the human race God pulled out of Adam half of the human race and when he and when Adam first set eyes upon this woman he says this is flesh of my flesh this is bone of my bone she came out of me and the Bible says that down all throughout history a woman will leave her mother and father and she will cling to her husband and the two that were separated will come back to each other and cling the one to the other and that's where God instituted marriage where the two that were the remember when God created Adam he created a male and female together and one but then God took out of Adam everything that was feminine and put it in a separate body and then drove them right back together to cling back the one to the other so when cried God did that as a type to show you Christ and the bride so when Christ was upon the cross he put that spear into his side out of his side flowed blood and water and then Jesus said into thy hands Lord I commit my spirit the three things that came out of Christ upon the cross blood water and spirit so he could take a bride that was pulled out Christ upon the cross through the blood that you are forgiven of your sins you're washed by the water of the word you're baptized into his name through the water amen and then you only what he gives you and refills you with the Spirit of the Living God what's he doing he is bringing you back to himself he pulled you out of him he you're in the thought of his mind he pulled you out of him and you I was thinking about that a while back as someone was asking me about my Christian walk and what I believed in Christ and how what doctrines I believed in and I says you know really my greatest desire is to be whatever Jesus Christ had in his mind when he was dying on upon that cross that's what I want to be and I will not rest until I can be that a man whatever it was that Jesus Christ added in his mind when he was dying on that cross that's why I want to be amen because I believe it's possible amen we are being drawn back to the side of Christ and as our brothers sung the song before I got a got up here as we'd come right back to his side amen draw me near near to thy side joy paves that pathway to keep lukewarmness out of your relationship amen well you know North eNOS prophesied of our age was that there would be a lack of oil would you read Matthew 25 it was prophesied that there are be many that would be called there would be many that were called to be servants of Christ there were many they were called to be a part of Christ but they are given a very specific duty that they were get all of these 10 virgins they were called to be ministers at the wedding amen to minister to do to to do servants at the wedding and when they you know when they were given these lamps they were given a duty to shine light all the way to the wedding and then partake of the ceremonies amen amen all Tim received a lamp and all ten of them had a little bit of oil with their lamp but there was five of them there were wiser than the rest and they thought that you know it's possible that we could run out of oil so in the case that that does happen I have to have another source to draw from so that no matter what happens if I start to run low on oil I can refill my vessel and I can shine light all the night long but there were five there were more foolish that didn't have the forethought to wonder what would happen and they didn't they didn't have the forethought to make sure that their duties could be met every hour of the watch every hour of the night and they even though that oil in their lamp they didn't bring extra in case they ran out amen and so as the parable goes in Matthew 25 says they all fell asleep that all of a sudden of shot went out a voice cried out that the bridegroom was coming a man at the end of the age at the end of the time the bridegroom was coming to bring him out call him out to the wedding and so they goes up and they began to prepare their lamps so that they could do what they were called to do in the age that they were at living it amen but as five of them that all their lamps had gone out and five of them said well all just my vessels getting a little low here I can just I have a source that I can draw from it's always by my side I can always reach out and and just pull from that source and I can refill my vessel amen the flows that were foolish they begin to realize their lamps were gone out and they had nowhere to go here the bridegroom is coming it's time for him to do exactly what they are called to do but because they were dilatory they were lukewarm their mind wasn't upon making sure that there could be fire upon the lamp like that high priests or that priest young priest making sure there's firewood at the office and the fire went out they were called foolish because they didn't know where their second source was you know all of us has a little bit of religiosity about them a little bit of a little bit of something that brings us to church here every Sunday every Wednesday something that makes us want to follow Christ a little bit but there's got to be that connection that source that if you're if you begin to get a little lukewarm and your walk towards Christ you have to have a place that you can go to refill your lamp to have a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen it ought to be a well beaten path so that anytime just like in a marriage just like it's your work just like anywhere that when you begin to fill yourself cooling off and your mission cooling off and the thing that you want cooling off in the and your in your your main goals in life that you can run back and refill your desire again in Christianity that's by being a refill with the Holy Ghost amen you know where the altar it's a well beaten path for you you know who your source is and this is the Holy Spirit he can restore the joy of your salvation amen God can restore if you've gotten lukewarm in your Christian walk God can restore the joy of your salvation and bring back to your remembrance why you got married to Christ in the first place amen why you got married to Christ in the first place and you know when I when I go to a church various churches to preach I always have in mind that there are those that are going to that church that the only reason they're there is because they grew up there there's gut there's never been that first fire Amen there's never been that original fire so they don't actually know it's just a religion to them and the world is filled with churches on every corner they're filled with people they're only going to church because their mother's told them they should come to church their father's told them they should come to church or they're just afraid of Hell or they're just afraid of this but that first fire has never been lit upon the altar they don't have the joy of their salvation amen let me tell you it's never been revealed to them what Christ has done for them amen and it's the ministers duty to bring that revelation it's the minister's duty to open up the channel for that relevant revelation to come amen but the atmosphere might be just right amen why so when Christ comes when the bridegroom cometh there's fire upon the altar there's a place for people who come have their sins taken care of amen now Isaiah 60:1 I want to read that this is what Jesus quoted from this scroll when he was in the temple from the Old Testament scroll when Jesus set up he said reading from the scroll he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings under the meat he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord amen also in verse 3 it says to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes he ever been burned in this life Christ has come to give beauty for Ashes amen the oil of joy for mourning the Bible says those that are crying God will answer their cry Amen those that mourn shall be healed amen the garment of praise to replace or for the spirit of heaviness so if you have a spirit of heaviness about you God has a garment of praise to give you a man-bag comes through restoring joy bringing back the joy that you once had or maybe you never did have amen amen so that when Christ comes you're not one of those it's called lukewarm upon the earth you know a lack of oil you think about a car you're a cart you can not change your oil for a long time you can get by for a while but you know if your your engine all sudden will get to the point where running one degree hotter used to two degrees hotter five degrees hotter the bearings are starting to heat up and all of a sudden those bearings that are have a maximum temperature that they're supposed to operate it and a few and the engine has an oil pump that keeps pumping oil through the engine and it keeps this flow of oil going through those bearings so if the bearings always have fresh oil fresh oil fresh oil but as your oil begins to get old it doesn't take away the heat it doesn't lubricate as much and the bearings begin to heat up a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more they're all sudden they begin to cross that threshold the engineers that said this bearing will operate properly until it gets to this temperature and then the steel begins to degrade and awesome they don't work anymore and it gets to a point it's the point of no return amen the bearings are overheating the engine will never be the same again amen and so when the Christian begins to run out of oil she has a duty to get that constant refreshment of the oil of the Holy Ghost amen if you're lose your temper if you're getting hot all the time you have a responsibility to run back to the altar if you lose if you realize your gain lukewarm if you lose your joy you have a responsibility to come back to Christ to the restoring joy a man just here in closing let's turn over to first Peter chapter 4 we'll read the first verse here in first Peter for Peter talking about the Christian life he says for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered in the flesh as ceased from sin amen we all have the same mind to suffer the things of life just like Christ said why because of the joy that is set before us let's go down to the the eighth thing the eighth verse it says and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins by fervent charity amongst yourselves why would you have that because of the potential for lukewarmness in the church hey man when when the oil begins to leave the church and all sudden the members of the church start bumping in one to the other one person says this to so-and-so and so-and-so says this to so-and-so people begin to get offended why because they're Luke lukewarmness assailing in the church things are cooling off the engines are overheating and men can no longer be what they're called to be but what if you have fervent charity one for the other then that love will be like the oil it'll cover a multitude of sins then when your brother bumps into you your steps on your toes then you can have loved one for the other well brother so-and-so he didn't mean that he's just going through a hard time or he just has mendler from such-and-such yet amen then you have room you make room for one another and for each other's mistakes Amen why because you yourself have rejected lukewarmness and you have oil within yourselves so that you don't respond when someone else is not responding properly amen amen when the Holy Ghost first came upon the Gentiles that came upon a man that was cost certainly praying and seeking the face of the law always Cornelius in Acts chapter 10 was the man when the Gentile of the holy ghost was first poured out on the Gentiles it was God had a choice of who he could pour out his Spirit upon the Gentiles first God had a decision to make where should I pour out my Holy Ghost upon the Gentiles and he looked upon all the Gentiles and he found Cornelius say hey God had a choice he chose Cornelius God has a choice today who to refill with the Holy Ghost God has a choice today of who should be the burning fire in our city the the the the altar where people can come and have their sins taken care of the altar where the fire is already burning the priest has already woken up early he's got the the wood stack already going he's got the fire upon the altar and everybody can come to the where the Lamb sacrifice is have their sins taken care of I don't care if they're a Hindu I don't care if they're a Muslim I don't care if they're a homosexual I don't care who they are they there's a place in this city that they can come and have their sins taken care of because there's a people who have a fire upon the altar Amen God has a choice of who he can bring the hurt and the lost - God has a choice of who he can bring those that need salvation - a man who who in the city God look upon the city and there are those that are wounded those that are crying out to God oh lord save me O Lord deliver me but there's gotta be someone that he God has already prepared who can stand up and say the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to bind up the brokenhearted there though anointed me to set loose those there in captivity and anointed to pour in the salva pond the wounds amen to show Christ to the world amen but it can't be those that are lukewarm they'll never show that Amen why because they can't show anything they're too worried about their own to help anybody else because their own life as a mess because they've drifted away from the love the fire of the gospel so how can they ever help someone else when they haven't even helped themselves yet that's not supposed to be with the Bride of Christ she is here to partner with Christ to be that spouse don't you love it when you and your spouse do something together you have a chore or something to do that are on the house and you do it together amen are you going you you witness together amen isn't that the greatest joy in the world when you get to do something like that together amen amen so is the splits supposed to be with Christ and his bride to minister to the city together amen but if the lukewarmness is there then the two don't connect the husband and the bride don't connect because you've become lukewarm amen and how can you work together you would rather be apart we in that situation ma because that's what happens when lukewarmness sets in the relationship you would rather be somewhere else than in each other's presents why but let the fire come back to the altar just once I let it restore the joy of your salvation then all of a sudden you love being together again then you can go out and be about your father's business and then you can stand up and be that ambassador of Christ in the city amen amen let's just stand amen we have a responsibility and an age that was prophesied to be lukewarm we have a responsibility to be the one that has overcome that Christ said I give up to the overcomer though to sit with me in my throne and the two shall be one Paul said don't you know the Saints shall judge the earth amen what because she will be with him about his business even over in the judgement they'll be sitting together upon the throne but that's just Bauer has a word for heavenly father when hot things become cold we call it lukewarm Lord and when in a church that is supposed to be the repository of the Holy Ghost in the city is becomes too worried about their own selves they can no longer take care of the other person's needs you say Lord I know your works I've examined the temperature I know that the setpoint is the Holy Ghost but the bride is not operating at temperature the temperature in the house of God is supposed to be on fire for Christ to fill that radiant warmth from the fire of the altar but if the heart has grown cold how can the city feel the warmth Lord you said I'll set a seal a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abominations that are done in the city there's got to be someone that has the answer there's got to be someone that is not worried about bringing this doctrine or or that doctrine worry so worried about being right that they forget to be Christ Lord let not be so with us we're not here Lord to be right we're not here to show our selves to be more right than someone else or to push others down so we can be up higher but we're here to be Christ to be on fire you to show the answer not to be better but just to be Christ at the Spirit of the Lord guy is upon us because he has anointed us bind up the brokenhearted to bind up bringing out the bandages for the wounds pouring the salve of the Holy Ghost to heal to deliver to let those out of prison that are bound Lord you asks your bride to join with you in that work Lord and and we want to do that father to be with you in the gospel so Lord let it be on to us like Mary said according to thy word let it be we want to be flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone Lord draw us closer to you or draw me nearer to the Lord to thy precious bleeding side as we sung this morning we ask these things in your name Lord because we know that it's possible if the words pass out of our lips father that they do not go out void Lord but they enter up to the altar of consideration Lord and that you are standing there right now Lord with your own blood Lord to make intercession for us a con our upon our confession and as we confess unto you that we want to be that bride that shines light all the way to the wedding supper of the Lamb we want to be that bride that works with you upon the field of this earth we as you said Lord cry out unto me to send workers into the harvest for the harvest is here Lord I pray father that will be us that would be so on fire for you that we'd have fire upon the altar and that radiant heat like the Sun radiates Lord across the cold space that wouldn't strike someone that they would feel that heat and know that there is a Sun somewhere that the son of the Living God is here amen he's here to warm those that are called Lord let it shine through us Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we're asking for it Lord let it be unto us according to thy word that people when they look upon us that we are attractive price is attractive and when you are here Lord to do your work Lord in us through us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost lesbian to us of Lord according to thy word in the name of Jesus Christ
