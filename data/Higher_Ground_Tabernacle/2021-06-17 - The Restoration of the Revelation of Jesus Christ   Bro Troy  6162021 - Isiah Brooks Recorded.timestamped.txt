[49:03] well that that word really has a lot of
[49:05] meaning to it you're claiming something
[49:08] you're not just claiming something but
[49:09] you're announcing something to the world
[49:12] victory is now mine now there was a day
[49:16] in the past when victory was not yours
[49:20] but something has caused you to stand up
[49:22] and come into this
[49:23] church tonight to come into this room
[49:26] and to
[49:27] shout out for all the internet and
[49:29] wherever else to hear
[49:31] that the bride of the lord jesus christ
[49:34] right here in des moines iowa is
[49:35] speaking
[49:36] victory is mine and because of that i
[49:40] i have also spoken unto my enemy satan
[49:43] and said
[49:44] get thee behind me because victory is
[49:47] now
[49:47] mine if we could scroll down through the
[49:49] next couple verses here
[49:52] look at there when i woke this morning
[49:57] i didn't have no doubt now remember this
[50:00] has been registered in heaven that you
[50:02] spoke this
[50:03] and let me tell you when i woke this
[50:05] morning there was no doubt victory is
[50:06] mine
[50:08] every morning it has been revealed to me
[50:11] that i know
[50:12] the god who has called me for this hour
[50:14] i know that god has called me for this
[50:15] day go ahead and just leave that up for
[50:17] a while
[50:17] i know the god that has called me to
[50:19] this moment i was born for this moment
[50:21] victory has become mine and it has given
[50:23] me a right to wake up every morning
[50:27] to not have a doubt on my mind amen
[50:31] i knew that the lord would bring me out
[50:34] i didn't have no doubt i got up wake i
[50:36] woke up i didn't have any doubt i knew
[50:37] the lord bring me out
[50:38] so i got down on my knees why because
[50:41] afflictions were coming
[50:42] oh we know afflictions will come even
[50:45] though we say
[50:46] those the victory is mine afflictions
[50:48] are going to come
[50:49] but i get down on my knees i said lord
[50:53] help me please and i rose up singing and
[50:57] shouting the victory
[51:00] now you know st peter did that one day
[51:02] he was he stepped out of the boat in
[51:04] victory
[51:06] i'm gonna walk on this water but the
[51:08] afflictions came
[51:10] and he gave one quick cry to the lord as
[51:13] he was sinking
[51:14] lord help me
[51:17] that's all he recorded that we said and
[51:20] immediately
[51:21] their christ was holding up his hand and
[51:24] we
[51:25] that's why victory was his victory was
[51:28] his one quick cry
[51:30] and then what joy was peter's
[51:33] peace was peter's the husband was peters
[51:36] jesus christ was peter's why one quick
[51:38] cry he called out
[51:40] lord save me and all those things were
[51:43] peter's
[51:44] amen so is that same thing has been
[51:46] given to the bride of christ you can
[51:48] you can shut that off now one quick cry
[51:52] unto the lord and peter said
[51:54] lord save me you know peter
[51:58] for a long time probably thought he was
[51:59] doing pretty good i thought he was doing
[52:01] pretty good when he stepped out of that
[52:03] boat there was that quick revelation
[52:05] he would not have stepped out of that
[52:06] boat if there hadn't been a revelation
[52:09] but when the test came and he began to
[52:12] sink
[52:13] he knew exactly where he had to go lord
[52:16] save me amen one quick cry
[52:20] and he was saved now the son of man we
[52:22] just read there the son of man came to
[52:24] seek and to save
[52:26] that which was lost
[52:30] the son of man came to seek out
[52:34] something that was lost and to save
[52:37] something that was lost
[52:38] and you saw it reenacted there in
[52:41] zacchaeus but
[52:42] actually that has reenacted every single
[52:45] time
[52:45] someone catches the revelation of the
[52:47] son of man
[52:48] every time the son of man is revealed to
[52:50] someone that uh
[52:52] that that is being reenacted all over
[52:55] again
[52:55] that someone is being sought out amen
[52:58] and someone is being saved
[53:00] amen because now if you go back to well
[53:03] why are they being saved well because
[53:04] something was lost
[53:07] well for in order to figure out well
[53:08] what is this salvation you have to
[53:10] figure what was lost
[53:11] well in order to figure out what was
[53:13] lost as jesus says from the beginning it
[53:15] wasn't so
[53:16] you have to go right back to what was
[53:18] lost at the beginning
[53:19] well what was lost was just what we saw
[53:22] in the song
[53:23] peace was lost in the beginning
[53:27] peace was theirs they lost it joy was
[53:30] theirs in the beginning
[53:32] but they lost it now if you could just
[53:34] go through and think about how great
[53:36] that fall was
[53:38] i mean you think about walking out in
[53:40] the cool of the morning you know
[53:42] there is never any snowfall there is
[53:44] never any torment in their bodies
[53:46] never any sickness you know walking out
[53:49] into the presence of the lord
[53:50] here comes the presence of the lord god
[53:52] right on time
[53:54] right on schedule right they oh let's go
[53:57] and
[53:57] let's go and have church in the garden
[53:59] again this morning
[54:01] here comes the let's go to have church
[54:03] with god right here in the noon time
[54:05] let's go again in the evening and have
[54:07] church with the lord presence of the
[54:09] lord god again
[54:10] and over and over again the presence of
[54:12] the lord god would meet them
[54:13] day after day after day as they walked
[54:16] through the garden peace was theirs
[54:18] joy was theirs never any sorrows never
[54:21] any death
[54:21] and all when all that was lost every
[54:23] graveyard was created because of that
[54:25] moment
[54:27] every hospital in the land you know
[54:29] they're building more and more hospitals
[54:30] all the time why because someone fell
[54:32] six thousand years ago because of that
[54:35] great fall back there every hospital it
[54:37] was ever created was created
[54:39] every graveyard every little mound of
[54:40] dirt every little tombstone was created
[54:43] right then and there
[54:44] because of the fall the fall was so
[54:46] great and they were designed to walk in
[54:48] the beauty of the presence of the lord
[54:50] into the purity of god's fullness
[54:52] everything that god had in his mind he
[54:54] was
[54:55] pouring out upon adam and eve but yet
[54:57] they lost it they lost it
[54:58] and that fall was so great until they
[55:00] came down to a
[55:02] to the the point of
[55:05] there after uh after they walked through
[55:08] the red sea and they
[55:10] uh were had been brought out by the
[55:12] mighty hand of jehovah and immediately
[55:14] aaron and then they
[55:15] start melting down the silver and gold
[55:17] god gave them and they
[55:18] made that golden calves and they start
[55:21] cutting themselves and
[55:22] worshiping this golden calf and that's
[55:24] how great this fall was
[55:27] so that the men and women they were
[55:28] designed to worship the almighty god
[55:31] even the ones that god had been revealed
[55:33] to could not even keep themselves
[55:35] god would reveal himself to a people and
[55:38] immediately they go
[55:39] on down to idolatry god reveals himself
[55:42] to a people
[55:43] and immediately they go into idolatry
[55:45] they go into sin
[55:46] and god can constantly constantly the
[55:48] son of man was revealed revealed
[55:50] revealed
[55:50] all throughout the bible and immediately
[55:52] the people that god has revealed himself
[55:54] to
[55:55] immediately a few years later a few
[55:57] decades later
[55:58] going right back down into idolatry
[56:00] going right back down into sin
[56:02] and over and over again how great that
[56:03] fall was
[56:06] so far away from what they ought to have
[56:08] been so far away from what the vision of
[56:10] god was but you know
[56:11] as great as that fall was
[56:16] of the fall of this day how powerful the
[56:19] fall has been in our day
[56:21] everyone is blind no one knows where
[56:23] they stand
[56:24] they say it's a gray of date light great
[56:26] light but it's a great
[56:27] day of great darkness and who can see
[56:30] and you walk around this world and no
[56:32] one can see christ
[56:34] they can't see him he's been the whole
[56:36] world has been blinded
[56:37] and no one can see him the fall has been
[56:39] so great so great so great
[56:41] but if the fall has been so great and
[56:43] that means the restoration
[56:44] has to be just as great amen
[56:48] there has to be a restoration to go
[56:50] right back
[56:51] up to where we were fell from there has
[56:53] to be something the restoration
[56:55] has to be so great to bring you right
[56:58] back to
[56:59] what was lost amen
[57:02] jesus said i came to seek and to save
[57:05] everything that was lost if it was lost
[57:09] if something fell if something
[57:11] fell down from what the vision was in
[57:13] the mind of god from the beginning
[57:14] well i've come down in the midst of time
[57:16] and i've come to seek that out and to
[57:18] save it
[57:19] to bring it back to restore
[57:27] in luke 18 there or 19 there right after
[57:30] he says that verse
[57:32] until in verse 10 he says for the son of
[57:34] man has come to
[57:36] seek and to save that which was lost
[57:39] verse 11 and it says
[57:41] and as they heard these things
[57:45] he added and spoke a parable
[57:48] because
[57:53] you can go and put verse 11 on the
[57:54] screen
[57:57] as soon as he said these things
[58:03] he added and he spoke a parable because
[58:06] he was nigh into jerusalem
[58:09] and because they thought that the
[58:11] kingdom of god should
[58:12] immediately appear and he began to give
[58:16] out a parable
[58:17] now he's come to bring a restoration
[58:19] he's come to seek and save that which
[58:21] lost
[58:21] but they thought the key this kingdom
[58:23] would immediately appear
[58:25] and she was like i'm going to give you a
[58:26] parable
[58:28] and then he gives that parable it's a
[58:29] familiar story you remember
[58:32] there was 10 servants i'm not going to
[58:33] read the whole thing i was paraphrasing
[58:35] here
[58:36] the man went to a far country to receive
[58:38] for himself a kingdom and to return
[58:41] he called his ten servants together to
[58:43] him
[58:44] as his ten servants gathered together
[58:48] he said i want you to occupy until i
[58:50] come
[58:51] and he gave them ten talents
[58:55] one talent per servant they told them
[58:58] occupy until i come
[59:00] but the citizens they hated him and they
[59:03] sent a message after him saying
[59:05] will not that this these men this man
[59:07] reign over us
[59:09] is not what the people today say they
[59:10] don't want christ to reign over him
[59:12] they are looking for every single thing
[59:15] that that the christian church
[59:16] has done throughout the ages and they
[59:18] says we don't want to be ruled by this
[59:20] christian church
[59:21] and they want to shake off all the
[59:23] shackles of morality all the shackles of
[59:25] of everything right
[59:29] but there's still 10 servants
[59:33] and it came to pass so when he returned
[59:35] to having received the kingdom they
[59:37] commanded his servants to be called to
[59:39] him
[59:39] unto him he had given the money he might
[59:42] know how much every man had gained by
[59:44] trading
[59:45] and you know the story came to one the
[59:47] one says well i
[59:48] thy pound now that he gave me is gained
[59:50] ten pounds
[59:51] he says uh a good and faithful servant
[59:53] because you've been faithful with very
[59:55] little
[59:56] have thou authority over ten cities the
[59:58] second one said the power that you gave
[1:00:00] me has gained five pounds
[1:00:02] he says likewise to him be thou also
[1:00:05] over
[1:00:06] five cities but then another king says
[1:00:09] lord here is the pound that you gave me
[1:00:12] here is the money that you gave me and i
[1:00:15] i kept it i laid it up in a safe place
[1:00:18] in this napkin here
[1:00:19] because i was afraid of you i knew that
[1:00:22] that were you're a strict man
[1:00:25] and that you take us up what you don't
[1:00:27] lay down and you reap what you did not
[1:00:29] sow
[1:00:30] and immediately that servant is judged
[1:00:32] by the words that came out of his mouth
[1:00:34] and he said i shouldn't because god
[1:00:37] expects a return from his investments
[1:00:40] god always expects a return in his
[1:00:42] investments
[1:00:43] if god has ever like as hebrews 6 says
[1:00:46] they that have tasted of the heavenly
[1:00:48] gift
[1:00:49] those that have been given a portion of
[1:00:51] the holy ghost
[1:00:52] those who have experienced the holy
[1:00:53] ghost god has an expectation
[1:00:56] to reap more than what he gave you
[1:00:59] if he has given you a token of the holy
[1:01:02] ghost giving you an expression of the
[1:01:04] holy ghost
[1:01:05] if he's ever once tugged at your heart's
[1:01:06] door come knocking by your heart's door
[1:01:09] if he's ever wants to fill you with the
[1:01:10] holy ghost
[1:01:11] everyone's giving you joy in your heart
[1:01:12] unspeakable amen or love divine any of
[1:01:15] those things
[1:01:16] if he ever once has given you those
[1:01:18] things he has an expectation
[1:01:20] that that thing will be multiplied in
[1:01:21] your life that'll be nurtured and
[1:01:23] they'll grow up and bear fruit
[1:01:24] and when hero comes back that he'll
[1:01:27] receive 10 times more than what he gave
[1:01:29] you
[1:01:31] amen now they thought the kingdom of god
[1:01:35] should immediately appear but there had
[1:01:37] to come a time
[1:01:38] of bearing a fruit there had to come a
[1:01:41] planting
[1:01:42] and there had become a growing and there
[1:01:45] had to come a harvest
[1:01:47] amen that had to repeat itself over and
[1:01:49] over again every age had to repeat
[1:01:51] itself seven ages
[1:01:52] amen constantly there was a a word would
[1:01:55] go out
[1:01:56] amen there was a sowing of the word a
[1:01:58] messenger would go out
[1:01:59] a word would be sowed into the earth a
[1:02:02] portion of the holy spirit would be
[1:02:04] given to an age
[1:02:05] and those would everybody had was
[1:02:06] responsible to do with the holy spirit
[1:02:10] whatever they would like to do amen just
[1:02:12] like
[1:02:14] esther in the bible that she was given
[1:02:16] everything that she wanted to have
[1:02:18] from the king's chambers however she
[1:02:20] wanted to present herself to the king
[1:02:22] in that age she had the right to present
[1:02:24] herself to the king that way
[1:02:26] and she was given everything she wanted
[1:02:28] and so she sought out the
[1:02:30] the the chamberlain and she said well
[1:02:32] what does the king like
[1:02:33] amen what does the king want to see hey
[1:02:36] i want to wear whatever it is that the
[1:02:37] king wants
[1:02:39] amen and every age has had that
[1:02:41] responsibility and this age is no
[1:02:43] different
[1:02:44] we have a responsibility not just to
[1:02:47] play with the gifts not just to uh as
[1:02:50] many churches have done
[1:02:51] not just to uh brag about having the
[1:02:54] gifts
[1:02:55] not just to break our church can speak
[1:02:57] with tongues or or our church can do
[1:02:59] this or
[1:03:00] and we've had those ages of that in time
[1:03:02] past but those ages are gone by
[1:03:04] amen amen now is not the age to be just
[1:03:08] bragging about having the gifts or to be
[1:03:10] bragging about this or
[1:03:12] or or to show off oh i got more than
[1:03:15] this no no no
[1:03:16] there is a time where there comes a time
[1:03:19] of restoration
[1:03:21] amen even as brother brahm in the tent
[1:03:22] mission he said it won't that third poll
[1:03:25] it will not be an open show
[1:03:27] he says i saw them go into that little
[1:03:29] structure
[1:03:30] and they had come out completely
[1:03:32] restored
[1:03:33] completely delivered completely made
[1:03:36] whole
[1:03:39] remember around the time of the seals he
[1:03:41] said i believe the day is coming the
[1:03:43] even
[1:03:43] missing limbs will be restored he had
[1:03:46] this
[1:03:46] vision in his mind that there's a day
[1:03:49] where restoration has to happen
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:54] now that restoration that that that
[1:03:57] message of restoration
[1:03:58] has now come to a last day peoples
[1:04:03] amen now it came to every age right the
[1:04:05] messenger to every age
[1:04:07] had their portion of their age they had
[1:04:10] the message to their age
[1:04:12] and when those they received the message
[1:04:14] that was a golden age to them
[1:04:17] now if you they did not receive the the
[1:04:19] the message
[1:04:20] they went off into judgment but for
[1:04:22] those that did receive the message
[1:04:25] they would go on to another age amen and
[1:04:28] so has it been in the laodicean age
[1:04:30] there has become to be a bride of christ
[1:04:33] who has stood up
[1:04:34] she's heard the message come out of her
[1:04:35] my people that you be not partaker of
[1:04:38] her sins
[1:04:38] amen and then as she looks within
[1:04:40] herself and she sees the sins
[1:04:42] the sins of the church world are
[1:04:44] revealed to her
[1:04:46] the two s the two the the two spirits
[1:04:49] that are in the church all throughout
[1:04:50] all ages
[1:04:51] uh have been revealed to her she
[1:04:54] listened to the message that was given
[1:04:55] to her
[1:04:56] and when she missed listens to that
[1:04:58] message all sudden a light bulb goes off
[1:05:01] and she begins to identify those two
[1:05:04] spirits
[1:05:04] in the church and there's always been
[1:05:07] those two spirits
[1:05:08] one of them is wicked and one of them is
[1:05:11] the holy ghost
[1:05:13] the seal the the trail of the serpent
[1:05:16] and the trail of the holy ghost those
[1:05:18] two trails that have gone down
[1:05:20] through the church history have now
[1:05:22] ended up at this last day
[1:05:23] but this last day the bride stands up
[1:05:26] she hears that
[1:05:27] that message come out of her my people
[1:05:29] that you beat up partakers of her sins
[1:05:31] and when she hears that message
[1:05:33] instantly those two spirits are revealed
[1:05:35] to her
[1:05:38] her eyes are opened she can see why
[1:05:41] that's why she can say
[1:05:43] get thee behind me satan why because
[1:05:46] it's been revealed to her
[1:05:47] who the son of man is who the revelation
[1:05:50] of the holy ghost is
[1:05:51] who the true holy spirit is and who that
[1:05:54] imposter is
[1:05:55] it's been revealed to her
[1:05:59] now we are not the first people
[1:06:02] throughout the ages they've been given
[1:06:04] a promise of restoration
[1:06:07] amen but you know in every age where
[1:06:10] there was given a promise of restoration
[1:06:13] the the message of restoration was to
[1:06:16] bring
[1:06:16] back to what was lost you know when
[1:06:19] abraham was
[1:06:20] getting old the the angel the lord spoke
[1:06:23] to him he says
[1:06:24] your seed will go into a foreign land
[1:06:27] they'll go into the land of the street
[1:06:29] and there'll be a stranger in a foreign
[1:06:31] land for
[1:06:32] 400 years but after those 400 years are
[1:06:35] over
[1:06:36] amen that i will bring them out with
[1:06:38] great substance
[1:06:40] with great riches and i will bring them
[1:06:42] right back here and restore them to the
[1:06:44] land that i have promised you
[1:06:47] and god did it amen god brought them out
[1:06:50] of egypt
[1:06:51] with all the wealth and gold of egypt
[1:06:54] they left egypt poor when they left
[1:06:56] amen and what they do they marched right
[1:06:58] to that promised land amen and they took
[1:07:00] it over
[1:07:01] it took them a while but they got there
[1:07:05] but there was a promise there regardless
[1:07:08] of how
[1:07:09] how they inherited the promise everyone
[1:07:12] in that age
[1:07:12] there was a joshua and caleb that
[1:07:14] marched out and says
[1:07:16] this is possible i can do this and there
[1:07:18] is always going to be someone that's
[1:07:20] going to stand up like joshua and caleb
[1:07:22] and say victory is mine
[1:07:25] i told satan get thee behind victory is
[1:07:28] now mine
[1:07:29] and they start naming it out peace is
[1:07:30] mine joy is mine
[1:07:32] the holy ghost is mine the land of
[1:07:35] israel the land of
[1:07:36] milk and honey joshua and caleb that
[1:07:38] land is mine
[1:07:39] and because it's mine every enemy that
[1:07:41] is in front of me i can say
[1:07:43] get thee behind me get thee behind me
[1:07:45] why because this is mine
[1:07:47] this is a day of restoration and because
[1:07:49] joshua and caleb realized that they were
[1:07:51] on a day of restoration
[1:07:53] they were the ones that were restored
[1:07:55] amen but to those that did not believe
[1:07:57] in the day of restoration
[1:07:59] they were the ones that didn't get to be
[1:08:01] restored
[1:08:05] now in the book of jeremiah another day
[1:08:08] of restoration was prophesied
[1:08:11] jeremiah 29 you remember
[1:08:15] you know isaiah and jeremiah both those
[1:08:17] prophets were
[1:08:18] were hammering on israel hammering on
[1:08:21] his on israel
[1:08:22] that you're you're getting ready to fall
[1:08:25] your your sins are heaping up you know
[1:08:28] the the prophecy of isaiah isaiah
[1:08:30] got greater and greater and greater and
[1:08:32] greater as he got older and older and
[1:08:34] older
[1:08:35] and all of a sudden time was too late
[1:08:38] another prophet came on the scene by the
[1:08:40] name of jeremiah and god says i'm
[1:08:42] sending you jeremiah but
[1:08:44] they're not going to listen to you time
[1:08:46] was
[1:08:47] running out instead of having a
[1:08:50] messenger of grace and mercy
[1:08:53] of a chance of an opportunity to repent
[1:08:56] they received a prophet that just
[1:08:57] preached
[1:08:58] judgment judgment judgment judgment amen
[1:09:01] but as soon as they went off into
[1:09:04] captivity
[1:09:06] as they were put into chains and led to
[1:09:09] babylon there
[1:09:11] in jeremiah's day that jeremiah stayed
[1:09:15] behind in jerusalem
[1:09:18] and as they went there to babylon that
[1:09:21] jeremiah was one day he was standing
[1:09:23] there in the courts or wherever he was
[1:09:25] and all of a sudden the voice of the
[1:09:27] lord came to him and it's jeremiah 29
[1:09:29] and 30 and
[1:09:30] the lord said to him write a letter
[1:09:34] to those in captive down there in
[1:09:36] jerusalem or in babylon
[1:09:38] write them a letter and he's te and this
[1:09:41] is what he told him he says
[1:09:43] 70 years he said i want you to go down
[1:09:46] there in peace
[1:09:48] i want you to go down there and
[1:09:51] in 29 5 he says
[1:09:54] build you houses dwelt and plant gardens
[1:09:57] eat fruit of them
[1:09:58] take wives big ass sons and daughters
[1:10:01] and all these things
[1:10:02] he's telling them be comfortable in
[1:10:04] babylon
[1:10:05] just wait there seek the peace of the
[1:10:07] city where i've caused you to be carried
[1:10:09] captives
[1:10:10] pray unto the lord for that city of
[1:10:12] babylon or wherever you are
[1:10:14] for in the peace thereof ye shall have
[1:10:16] peace and and god told him just sit here
[1:10:19] be comfortable be comfortable
[1:10:20] amen but then in verse 10 he says for
[1:10:23] thus saith lord
[1:10:24] after 70 years i will come and i will
[1:10:27] visit you
[1:10:28] i have perform my good word towards you
[1:10:31] in causing you to return to this place
[1:10:34] verse 11 he tells them for i know the
[1:10:36] thoughts that i think towards you
[1:10:38] saith the lord thoughts of peace and
[1:10:40] ought of evil to give you an unexpected
[1:10:42] and think about the condition these
[1:10:44] people were in
[1:10:45] they lost their temple they lost their
[1:10:48] homeland
[1:10:48] they lost everything that jehovah had
[1:10:50] given them all the gold that solomon had
[1:10:52] created
[1:10:53] all the all the the temple that solomon
[1:10:56] had created all the
[1:10:57] the ark of the covenant and everything
[1:10:59] the the ten commandments that moses
[1:11:01] had in the ark of the covenant they lost
[1:11:03] it all
[1:11:05] they lost every little bit of it and now
[1:11:07] they're in chains in babylon and
[1:11:09] and they're wondering where did we go
[1:11:10] wrong what happened to us here
[1:11:12] and god sends a message
[1:11:16] there will be a restoration there will
[1:11:19] be a day of restoration
[1:11:20] and you wait here and and he told them
[1:11:22] the time the restoration
[1:11:24] happened 70 years the restoration came
[1:11:27] place
[1:11:27] and i'll bring you back out of this
[1:11:30] place
[1:11:30] i will restore you back amen i will
[1:11:34] visit
[1:11:34] you i will perform my word towards you i
[1:11:37] will have thoughts of peace towards you
[1:11:39] i with at that time you'll call upon me
[1:11:42] you'll go and you'll pray to me and i
[1:11:43] will hearken unto you
[1:11:44] you shall seek me and you will find me
[1:11:46] when you seek with me
[1:11:47] me with all your heart you will find me
[1:11:50] and oh and just constantly messages of
[1:11:52] mercy messages of grace
[1:11:54] and then he says i will be found of you
[1:11:57] i will turn away your captivity i will
[1:11:59] gather you together
[1:12:01] amen i'll bring you back here right
[1:12:03] again what i will restore saith the lord
[1:12:05] i'll restore saith the lord god
[1:12:07] constantly gave them a message of
[1:12:09] restoration
[1:12:15] same thing happened in the day in the
[1:12:17] days of joel chapter two
[1:12:19] he says when they're living there and
[1:12:21] they hadn't fully received the promises
[1:12:24] yet
[1:12:24] amen they were trying to bring back to
[1:12:27] to jerusalem they hadn't received the
[1:12:28] promises yet
[1:12:29] and god says i will come i will send you
[1:12:31] the former and the latter reign
[1:12:32] i will restore all the years that the
[1:12:34] enemy is eaten amen i will do this
[1:12:37] i will do that i will do this and
[1:12:39] there's came a day of revealing god
[1:12:41] always throughout all these
[1:12:43] messages of restoration he first
[1:12:45] prophesies of the falling away
[1:12:48] amen and then as the falling away is
[1:12:49] taking place he says but
[1:12:51] you're going to come back but you're
[1:12:53] going to come back and however great
[1:12:55] that fall was
[1:12:58] that's how great the restoration was
[1:13:01] whatever it was that you lost
[1:13:04] that's what you're going to receive back
[1:13:06] amen but you know all those
[1:13:07] all those natural restorations have
[1:13:09] taken place
[1:13:10] and all those natural restorations have
[1:13:13] taken place but we've come here in the
[1:13:14] last days
[1:13:16] and there is a a day of restoration not
[1:13:19] just to inherit a natural land
[1:13:21] but no but the meek shall inherit the
[1:13:23] whole earth
[1:13:26] amen not just the restoration of uh gold
[1:13:29] and silver on this earth
[1:13:32] but of gold and silver in the heavens
[1:13:35] amen not just uh you know gold and
[1:13:38] silver you

[1:13:41] it'll be done but no but no but

[1:13:49] to you oh that's more than gold or
[1:13:51] silver for the gold and silver the
[1:13:52] future kingdom
[1:13:53] is the word of god and the faith in that
[1:13:56] word
[1:13:57] and that's what's being restored faith
[1:13:58] in the word of god
[1:14:00] amen everything that was lost
[1:14:03] has to be restored amen and we're living
[1:14:06] in that day of the final restoration for
[1:14:08] the bride of christ
[1:14:12] let's turn over to luke 17 30.
[1:14:45] remember they said this is where the
[1:14:48] pharisees had demanded when is the
[1:14:51] kingdom of god going to come that you
[1:14:52] keep preaching about
[1:14:56] verse 21 he says don't don't look say
[1:14:59] over here over there
[1:15:00] he says the kingdom of heaven kingdom of
[1:15:02] god is within you
[1:15:04] but then he began to talk to his
[1:15:05] disciples and tell them about the second
[1:15:08] coming
[1:15:10] and he says the days will come we shall
[1:15:12] desire to see one of these days of the
[1:15:14] son of man verse 22
[1:15:15] you won't see it and he says you'll say
[1:15:19] see here
[1:15:20] see there but don't go after them don't
[1:15:22] follow them
[1:15:23] for as the lightning lighteneth out one
[1:15:25] part of the heaven unto the other part
[1:15:28] so shall the son of man be in his day
[1:15:31] but first must he be rejected of many
[1:15:33] things to be rejected of this generation
[1:15:37] and he has been rejected and as it was
[1:15:40] in the days of noah
[1:15:42] so shall be in the days of the son of
[1:15:43] man there will come
[1:15:46] again the days of the son of man right
[1:15:48] verse 27 they did they eat they drank
[1:15:51] they married wives they were given in
[1:15:53] marriage until the day that noah entered
[1:15:55] into the ark
[1:15:56] and then the flood came and destroyed
[1:15:58] them all you know it's going to be the
[1:16:00] same way in this day
[1:16:02] it is already verse 28 likewise
[1:16:06] also in the days of lot they were eating
[1:16:08] they were drinking
[1:16:09] they sold they planted they built it but
[1:16:11] this that same day that lot went out of
[1:16:14] sodom
[1:16:14] and rained down fire and brimstone from
[1:16:16] heaven
[1:16:17] and it destroyed them all even thus
[1:16:20] shall be in the day that the son of man
[1:16:22] is being revealed
[1:16:23] amen even thus shall be in the day that
[1:16:27] the son of man has been revealed
[1:16:29] the son of man has been and is being
[1:16:32] revealed
[1:16:34] amen the son of man has been and is
[1:16:37] being revealed
[1:16:39] that is the day that we are living in
[1:16:41] now i don't know about you but
[1:16:42] i know i've preached this over and over
[1:16:45] again now brother farmer here
[1:16:47] i i i love that testimony he gave it was
[1:16:50] death
[1:16:52] i hadn't heard that testimony before and
[1:16:55] it was just
[1:16:56] to have a witness stand right here
[1:17:00] and we are without excuse and he told
[1:17:04] the testimony about how his
[1:17:05] his dad was a little boy and was
[1:17:08] crippled
[1:17:09] in 1961 and his
[1:17:12] and his grandfather brought his son
[1:17:16] brought the son to one of brother bram's
[1:17:18] meetings
[1:17:21] and wasn't sure and he wasn't sure about
[1:17:24] he had heard that brother branham was a
[1:17:26] mind reader
[1:17:28] and he so he went back and he was
[1:17:30] researching what mind reading was
[1:17:33] and i'm just telling his testimony again
[1:17:35] i hope that's all right
[1:17:36] but he's telling why his test that the
[1:17:38] the testimony of it
[1:17:40] or that that his his grandfather and
[1:17:43] brother cliff's grandfather had said
[1:17:45] that he didn't know what a mind reader
[1:17:47] was so he went back and researched it
[1:17:49] and found out that if you sit far enough
[1:17:51] away they can't read your mind
[1:17:54] so he went to brother branham's meeting
[1:17:56] and he went and he set way way
[1:17:58] way in the back
[1:18:01] and he put
[1:18:04] the brother forest you know all know
[1:18:06] brother forrest i just met him there
[1:18:08] again about a month ago
[1:18:11] put his young son forrest down on the
[1:18:15] floor
[1:18:15] laid him down there crippled son
[1:18:19] and i don't remember the whole testimony
[1:18:21] but but uh
[1:18:22] as as uh brother branham was there
[1:18:25] preaching that message in 1961
[1:18:28] that all of a sudden i believe it was
[1:18:30] the first the first
[1:18:32] the first uh the sign that was given
[1:18:34] that night
[1:18:36] was that brother branham called out
[1:18:41] the brother all the way in the back
[1:18:44] and said you there you pray you're
[1:18:47] praying for your son
[1:18:49] he's crippled thus saith the lord
[1:18:53] he'll be healed your name is mr farmer
[1:18:56] take him back go back to where you came
[1:18:58] from you're healed
[1:19:00] called his name now i don't know about
[1:19:03] you
[1:19:04] but if that had been me in that meeting
[1:19:08] wild horses couldn't drag me away from
[1:19:10] this message
[1:19:13] couldn't do it why because god gave that
[1:19:16] to that brother
[1:19:19] now i may not have been there in that
[1:19:20] meeting i wasn't there
[1:19:22] but i have heard it on the tapes and
[1:19:25] when i hear those things
[1:19:27] i realize that a man cannot do that
[1:19:31] when brother branham would turn his back
[1:19:34] to the audience he was doing that for a
[1:19:36] very specific reason
[1:19:38] he wasn't showing off there's you know
[1:19:40] there's some people who think that he
[1:19:41] was just trying to show off
[1:19:42] trying to be a show-off no he was
[1:19:45] mimicking a sign he was revealing a sign
[1:19:50] amen to this gender i won't say the word
[1:19:52] mimicking but he was revealing a sign
[1:19:54] to this generation that just like the
[1:19:58] angel
[1:19:59] that visited abraham that same angel is
[1:20:02] visiting us
[1:20:03] again amen just like
[1:20:06] lot was down there in sodom and gomorrah
[1:20:09] abraham the chosen one was up on the
[1:20:11] hill
[1:20:12] receiving a visitation and even so as
[1:20:16] the whole world is blinded
[1:20:18] they're off in sodom and gomorrah we in
[1:20:20] these last days have received a
[1:20:22] visitation
[1:20:23] and as the angel stood with us back to
[1:20:26] the tent and said
[1:20:27] why why did sarah laugh
[1:20:30] even brother brandon was staying with us
[1:20:32] back to the audience you there in the
[1:20:34] yellow dress you were just praying
[1:20:36] you were just praying and about your
[1:20:38] father who's in louisville
[1:20:40] go back and find him and as
[1:20:44] your faith as you believed
[1:20:47] you'll find him healed
[1:20:50] that was a sign to this age
[1:20:54] what was that sign for this is a day of
[1:20:57] the revealing of the son of man
[1:21:00] a day when all things shall be restored
[1:21:03] a day when we're not just receiving a
[1:21:05] restoration back to
[1:21:07] the israel to a natural or have a
[1:21:10] restored temple
[1:21:11] but to have the temple restored to have
[1:21:14] the earth restored and all those things
[1:21:17] have come to you and to me
[1:21:18] i don't want to you know people they
[1:21:20] think well it's been so many decades now

[1:24:53] got to have the holy ghost in our lives
[1:24:56] we got to have the freshness of the
[1:24:58] power of the holy ghost
[1:24:59] oh that foolish virgin she wakes up and
[1:25:02] she realizes i don't have the holy ghost
[1:25:04] like i thought i did
[1:25:05] i like i used to have but not so with
[1:25:08] the bride of christ
[1:25:09] she's got that extra vessel right there
[1:25:11] by her side
[1:25:12] amen right there by her side and when
[1:25:15] she begins to run a little dry

[1:25:44] was promised give me my mountain
[1:25:47] amen it's my inheritance he paid for it
[1:25:50] this is the day of restoration
[1:25:52] he came to seek and to save that which
[1:25:54] was lost and to restore them back to the
[1:25:56] position they lost
[1:25:58] amen before the foundation or before the
[1:26:00] however great that fall was that's how
[1:26:02] great the restoration
[1:26:04] has to be amen
[1:26:07] amen he came to make a restoration
[1:26:10] amen yoda and you look at the pattern of
[1:26:13] the book of revelations
[1:26:15] you look at the it's beautiful if you
[1:26:18] actually
[1:26:19] kind of just take a high-level view of
[1:26:21] the book of revelations
[1:26:26] it's really beautiful how everything is
[1:26:28] laid out
[1:26:30] because in the beginning of the book in
[1:26:32] revelations chapter 1
[1:26:35] brother brandon called the patmos vision
[1:26:38] amen and he
[1:26:39] he talked about the deity of jesus
[1:26:40] christ that jesus christ
[1:26:44] is being revealed and in the beginning
[1:26:47] there you hear one voice that's the
[1:26:49] voice of the lord jesus christ
[1:26:51] christ is being revealed and as christ
[1:26:54] is being revealed
[1:26:56] all of a sudden all of a sudden you all
[1:26:58] suddenly looks down at his hand he
[1:27:00] realizes that there christ has
[1:27:02] seven stars in his hand amen and
[1:27:06] he's walking in the midst of these seven
[1:27:07] golden candle sticks
[1:27:09] amen all sudden and then and then saint
[1:27:12] john begins to catch the revelation of
[1:27:14] all the church ages
[1:27:15] and he's catching the revelation jesus
[1:27:17] christ will be in the midst of every age
[1:27:20] every age you'll have the revelation of
[1:27:22] jesus christ
[1:27:23] i've gotten seven stars holding right in
[1:27:25] the hand of christ
[1:27:26] and i'll send them to every age to this
[1:27:29] age to this age to this age
[1:27:31] and to the laodicean age they will
[1:27:33] receive a message
[1:27:34] and it will be right back to like the
[1:27:36] message of the first age amen
[1:27:38] amen and then and every single message
[1:27:41] every single age received their message
[1:27:43] and those messengers were in the hand
[1:27:46] of the re of revealed the lord jesus
[1:27:49] christ
[1:27:50] and the and the lord revealed lord jesus
[1:27:52] christ
[1:27:53] was walking in the midst of those seven
[1:27:55] golden churches
[1:27:56] so those seven golden candle sticks was
[1:27:59] walking right in the midst
[1:28:00] of him amen even so right now in the
[1:28:02] midst of the laodicean age
[1:28:04] christ has been circling the candlestick
[1:28:07] walking in the midst of it holding the
[1:28:09] messenger in your hands amen so when you
[1:28:11] look at the life of brother bam
[1:28:13] realizing that he was in the hand
[1:28:15] of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:19] he was that star amen he was gifted that
[1:28:23] that that anointing amen that angel
[1:28:27] to be that was that star in the hand
[1:28:30] and that's the message we have received
[1:28:32] amen and after
[1:28:34] john caution caught the revelation of
[1:28:36] those seven
[1:28:37] ages all of a sudden a door was opened
[1:28:39] into heaven
[1:28:40] and the voice say come up here there
[1:28:41] john i want to show you things to come
[1:28:43] i want to lift you up off these natural
[1:28:46] things and come up into the heavens i
[1:28:47] want to show you the heavenly things
[1:28:49] and then brother ram starts saying you
[1:28:51] know john was a type of the bride of
[1:28:53] christ
[1:28:54] amen and so the bride of christ also has
[1:28:57] to be resurrected
[1:28:58] not just in a rapture but before the
[1:29:01] rapture she has to be revealed that son
[1:29:03] of man has to be revealed to her
[1:29:05] amen and as the son of man is revealed
[1:29:07] to her she sits with him in his throne
[1:29:10] she sits with him in heavenly places and
[1:29:12] she begins to blend more from the
[1:29:14] negative to the positive amen is what
[1:29:16] brother branson
[1:29:21] and she leaves the leo laodicean age
[1:29:24] behind and enters into a bride age
[1:29:26] to be prepared for a rapture right now
[1:29:30] is the revealing of the son of man
[1:29:32] and the son of man must be revealed to
[1:29:36] you after the seven
[1:29:39] ages were revealed in a mystery
[1:29:44] then john went up into the heavens
[1:29:49] and the book of redemption was revealed
[1:29:52] that the the book of the redemption had
[1:29:55] the entire
[1:29:56] plan of god all the way back to the
[1:29:59] beginning
[1:30:00] and it was revealed to the bride
[1:30:03] after she goes up into heavenly places
[1:30:06] is revealed to the bride
[1:30:08] what the mystery of that book was and to
[1:30:11] what the mystery of what was lost
[1:30:14] amen so to be in order to be restored
[1:30:16] back you have to know what you lost
[1:30:19] and so the seals were ripped off the
[1:30:20] book and we begin to reveal
[1:30:22] this is what was lost and all those
[1:30:25] mysteries of marriage and divorce and
[1:30:27] melchizedek all these things that and
[1:30:29] brother branham just starts going
[1:30:30] through and preaching the message
[1:30:32] preaching the messages preaching the
[1:30:33] messages if you don't know what all
[1:30:35] those are you got to listen to them
[1:30:37] the son of man ought to be revealed to
[1:30:39] you let the seals be unveiled to you
[1:30:42] amen why because that's the pattern of
[1:30:44] the bride of christ where like when john
[1:30:46] went up hither so
[1:30:47] the bride has to go up hither and
[1:30:48] experience the opening of the book to
[1:30:51] her
[1:30:52] the opening of the mysteries and as the
[1:30:54] mysteries are beginning to be revealed
[1:30:55] to you
[1:30:56] and then you see a slain lamb standing
[1:30:58] in the midst of those victories because
[1:31:00] let me tell you
[1:31:01] some of those mysteries are revealed you
[1:31:02] realize i'm on the wrong side of them
[1:31:04] i mean there's some that are divorced
[1:31:06] there's some that are this there's some
[1:31:08] that are that there's some that are this
[1:31:09] amen by then there stands that slain
[1:31:12] lamb
[1:31:13] right in the midst of the revealed
[1:31:14] mysteries and brother bannon says
[1:31:17] i tell my people don't you do that again
[1:31:21] amen what the slain lamb was standing
[1:31:24] right in the middle the revealed
[1:31:25] mysteries giving the look this is the
[1:31:28] way it's supposed to be i am restoring
[1:31:30] you back to this
[1:31:31] amen and the mysteries are being
[1:31:33] revealed
[1:31:35] what what's happening our old sins
[1:31:39] all the things that we've done all in
[1:31:41] all of our foolishness all the things
[1:31:43] we're done are being stripped away from
[1:31:45] us
[1:31:45] amen put in the sea of forgetfulness as
[1:31:48] we watch that slain land we've gone into
[1:31:50] heavenly places
[1:31:51] and we see the sacrifice upon the throne
[1:31:57] once it's been revealed to you that
[1:32:00] you're standing
[1:32:01] righteous purified redeemed by the blood
[1:32:05] of the lamb he's come to seek and save
[1:32:07] that which was lost and that was me
[1:32:09] but now he's placed us back as sons and
[1:32:12] daughters of god
[1:32:13] and restored us back he's put us in
[1:32:15] position like the fall
[1:32:17] never took place brother graham said
[1:32:20] hallelujah and once you get into that
[1:32:23] condition
[1:32:24] then you march forward in the re in the
[1:32:26] book of revelation
[1:32:27] then it begins to reveal what's going to
[1:32:30] happen to the jews
[1:32:31] and then begins to reveal the enemy the
[1:32:34] enemy
[1:32:35] the enemy is beginning to be revealed
[1:32:37] all he's done throughout all the ages
[1:32:40] all that he's doing in this present age
[1:32:42] and how that trail of the serpent has
[1:32:44] weaved its way throughout history
[1:32:45] and all that is revealed to the bride of
[1:32:47] christ and brother bran said
[1:32:49] that the true church will catch the
[1:32:51] revelation
[1:32:52] of who the true church is and of the two
[1:32:55] spirits
[1:32:56] amen shall realize who she is she
[1:32:58] realized who the two spirits are in the
[1:33:00] church
[1:33:00] and she can identify that that trail of
[1:33:04] the serpent as it moves on down
[1:33:06] throughout the church throughout the
[1:33:08] ages and right up to this day
[1:33:11] right now that was a great falling away
[1:33:14] the serpent is still
[1:33:15] moving through the church well it's
[1:33:17] revealed to the bride of christ
[1:33:19] amen we have followed the pattern of the
[1:33:21] book of revelations perfectly
[1:33:23] israel at this time is being revealed to
[1:33:25] us
[1:33:26] right because things are happening in
[1:33:28] israel in the natural
[1:33:30] to get them ready it has been happening
[1:33:33] since the 40s
[1:33:34] israel is being prepared in the natural
[1:33:38] and as soon as the bride goes up she'll
[1:33:40] begin to be prepared
[1:33:41] in the supernatural by the holy ghost
[1:33:44] by the two witnesses amen but right now
[1:33:48] we right now israel is being prepared in
[1:33:51] the natural
[1:33:52] while we are being prepared in the
[1:33:53] supernatural
[1:33:59] amen remember the old testament there
[1:34:00] was the two brides that were prepared
[1:34:02] there was a
[1:34:03] there was an esther and a ruth one was a
[1:34:05] jew one was a gentile
[1:34:06] same thing in this day there's two
[1:34:07] brides the gentile bride
[1:34:10] and the jewish bride 144 000.
[1:34:17] but after the enemy is revealed
[1:34:21] as soon as that enemy is revealed a
[1:34:23] voice goes out and says come out of her
[1:34:25] my people
[1:34:26] that you've been our partakers over
[1:34:28] since and there's got to come
[1:34:30] in the last days where where the they
[1:34:32] will
[1:34:33] they they must leave there was a time
[1:34:37] where
[1:34:37] yeah you can stay yes you can stay but
[1:34:40] there comes a time where
[1:34:41] you must leave there was a time when
[1:34:44] denominations were okay
[1:34:46] anyway but now there is a time now where
[1:34:47] you must leave
[1:34:49] you must come out of her my people you
[1:34:51] must come not just not denominations
[1:34:52] about denominational thinking
[1:34:54] amen all the systems of man even right
[1:34:56] here in this message
[1:34:57] every system of man must fall and the
[1:34:59] bride has to stand alone by the power of
[1:35:02] none but the holy ghost
[1:35:04] come out of her my people that you be
[1:35:06] not partakers of her sins
[1:35:08] and then right after that and also the
[1:35:10] voice says

[1:35:15] to show you the last revelation the last
[1:35:17] of this revelation

[1:35:33] she's been washed by the blood of the
[1:35:35] lamb all the wrinkles have been ironed
[1:35:37] out by the flame and the heat of the
[1:35:39] holy spirit
[1:35:42] she's been restored brother and
[1:35:45] john says i saw the bride coming down

[1:38:08] amen our provider has become the
[1:38:10] presence amen of the lord jesus christ
[1:38:13] as the son of man has revealed to you it
[1:38:15] brings his presence amen
[1:38:18] amen there must be a promise of
[1:38:20] restoration
[1:38:21] amen all the effects of the fall
[1:38:25] are to be reversed in this hour
[1:38:29] amen and just like joshua and caleb
[1:38:32] before they crossed that river jordan
[1:38:35] they got to go across the river jordan a
[1:38:36] little bit early
[1:38:38] eat the fruits of the land bring back
[1:38:41] the evidence of the land
[1:38:42] before everybody else went over and tell
[1:38:45] me what do you
[1:38:46] you know i believe that that that as
[1:38:48] brother brown says i believe the time
[1:38:50] will come
[1:38:51] when missing limbs will be restored he
[1:38:53] says i saw them going to that booth
[1:38:55] and they came out what happened what
[1:38:56] happened she said i don't know what
[1:38:58] happened i bet i've been completely
[1:38:59] restored
[1:39:02] there's got to be a time come when
[1:39:04] rapturing
[1:39:05] faith begins to to to rise up within the
[1:39:08] bride of christ
[1:39:11] why is that say because she says victory
[1:39:13] is mine
[1:39:14] peace is mine joy is mine
[1:39:18] the holy ghost is mine all these things
[1:39:20] are mine
[1:39:21] and i spoke said to satan get thee
[1:39:23] behind me i've been resurrected i've
[1:39:26] i've been i've been
[1:39:27] the son of man has been revealed to me i
[1:39:29] know who he is
[1:39:30] i know who i am and we're beginning to
[1:39:32] speak in in unison the alpha has become
[1:39:35] the omega
[1:39:36] the son of man that was revealed 2000
[1:39:38] years ago has now been revealed to me
[1:39:40] i know who he is and not only do i know
[1:39:42] who he is i know who i
[1:39:44] am amen when she knows who she is and
[1:39:46] she can do the greater works
[1:39:48] then a rapture takes place amen
[1:39:52] that's the moment in time that we are
[1:39:54] living in amen jesus christ came to seek
[1:39:57] and to save
[1:39:58] that which was lost amen
[1:40:01] there were two rich men at that time
[1:40:03] that jesus was ministering to
[1:40:05] there was the rich young ruler and god
[1:40:08] spoke to him
[1:40:09] and the rich young ruler came up to him
[1:40:11] and says a good master you know what
[1:40:13] what what must i do to be saved you know
[1:40:16] he says well
[1:40:18] what does the scripture say how do you
[1:40:20] read it and he says
[1:40:22] well you know i do that i'll be good
[1:40:25] be a good person and do this over here
[1:40:27] and i had all those things and
[1:40:30] and jesus says well you know
[1:40:35] the young ruler says i've done all that
[1:40:37] since i was young
[1:40:39] and jesus says well one thing you still
[1:40:42] lack
[1:40:44] he says i want you to sell all that you
[1:40:46] have
[1:40:48] and then you'll have treasure in heaven
[1:40:53] and then come and follow me if you want
[1:40:55] to be perfect
[1:40:57] perfection was laid before him like an
[1:41:00] open door but you know
[1:41:04] that zacchaeus got a little bit
[1:41:06] different message
[1:41:10] because when jesus came to zacchaeus at
[1:41:12] his house
[1:41:14] zacchaeus was up in a tree and jesus
[1:41:18] looked at him and said come down
[1:41:20] zacchaeus i have to come and eat with
[1:41:22] you
[1:41:24] i must come and eat with you and as they
[1:41:26] were sitting there at the table all of a
[1:41:27] sudden zacchaeus got inspired he stood
[1:41:29] up he says
[1:41:30] lord the half that i have i give to you
[1:41:34] to the poor now
[1:41:37] the rich young ruler had to give
[1:41:38] everything
[1:41:40] but here zacchaeus just sit up and
[1:41:43] voluntarily gave half
[1:41:46] what why the difference now to the one
[1:41:49] the one lost salvation but when
[1:41:51] zacchaeus did it jesus stood up and says
[1:41:54] this day salvation has come to this
[1:41:56] house
[1:41:58] for christ has come to seek and save
[1:42:00] that which was lost
[1:42:01] what was the difference well zacchaeus
[1:42:05] was one that was lost
[1:42:07] the rich young ruler hadn't been lost he
[1:42:10] didn't have that representation
[1:42:12] amen he could follow in the natural but
[1:42:15] he couldn't
[1:42:16] the son of man could not be revealed to
[1:42:18] him all it was just a dead letter to him
[1:42:21] but to him who the son of man is
[1:42:23] revealed
[1:42:25] to them it's not all you have to give
[1:42:27] all this up and do all this
[1:42:30] the do's and don'ts no it's jesus said
[1:42:33] when he sat down at the last supper he's
[1:42:35] he breathed in deeply he had the
[1:42:38] cup of wine there he breathes in the
[1:42:41] aroma of the wine he says
[1:42:44] with desire i have desire to eat the
[1:42:46] supper with you before i suffer
[1:42:49] and i tell you the truth i will not eat
[1:42:50] of this again
[1:42:52] until i eat it with you in glory because
[1:42:55] he had in mind
[1:42:56] you and me that he was not going to eat
[1:42:59] or the fruit of the vine again
[1:43:00] until you and me could join him at the
[1:43:03] last supper
[1:43:04] he said with desire i have desired to
[1:43:07] eat this supper with you
[1:43:09] and even so there at the supper tale of
[1:43:11] zacchaeus
[1:43:12] you know we're at the tree there he says
[1:43:13] zacchaeus come down
[1:43:15] i must eat with you today god has a
[1:43:18] desire for fellowship
[1:43:20] amen every single one of us has been
[1:43:22] laid an open door before us
[1:43:24] you can either be the rich young ruler
[1:43:26] or you could be zacchaeus
[1:43:27] you can either uh be worrying about all
[1:43:29] the do's and don'ts and
[1:43:30] try to live a natural christian life or
[1:43:32] or you could have the son of man be
[1:43:34] revealed to you
[1:43:36] but if the son of man be revealed to you
[1:43:38] then come up hither
[1:43:40] and see where you're standing amen
[1:43:42] brother branson says break into we all
[1:43:43] break into the heavenlies
[1:43:45] and see where we're at amen but until
[1:43:47] you break into those heavenlies
[1:43:49] until you get into that spirit you can't
[1:43:51] see how can the son of man be revealed
[1:43:53] to you
[1:43:54] how can you know where you're standing
[1:43:55] we are we're standing here in this
[1:43:58] dull dreary age with everything is gray
[1:44:01] and black and
[1:44:02] and it's a it's a it's not a dark day
[1:44:04] it's not a light day everything's
[1:44:06] gray and misty amen it's a pale horse
[1:44:09] age
[1:44:12] but to those that saw a great light
[1:44:16] the clouds began to part they began to
[1:44:18] soar
[1:44:19] up above the clouds and they get a
[1:44:21] glimpse of the sun
[1:44:22] amen i like i you get on those dry
[1:44:26] dreary days and you get on an airplane
[1:44:28] and you park through those clouds and
[1:44:29] you know you're one of the only people
[1:44:31] in the city
[1:44:31] that gets to see the sun that day you're
[1:44:34] a special man
[1:44:35] you're a special woman amen so is it so
[1:44:37] with the bride of christ
[1:44:39] if you take advantage of it and a door
[1:44:41] has been opened to heaven
[1:44:43] to every single one of us amen we have a
[1:44:45] duty to say what the bride says to say
[1:44:48] what the spirit
[1:44:48] says amen to speak
[1:44:52] in unison amen and to be restored back
[1:44:56] to everything that was lost
[1:44:57] and when caleb got to that river and he
[1:45:00] began to realize that there was an
[1:45:02] opportunity
[1:45:03] 400 years 440 years has been
[1:45:07] since we since we crossed this river
[1:45:10] since we went the wrong direction
[1:45:11] since we lost our inheritance all those
[1:45:14] years
[1:45:15] since since joseph was sold into slavery
[1:45:18] i haven't had a chance to go back but
[1:45:21] now is the time to be restored and when
[1:45:23] joshua and caleb caught that revelation
[1:45:25] they got inspired and they said this is
[1:45:28] mine
[1:45:29] this fruit is mine give me my mountain i
[1:45:31] get thee behind me satan
[1:45:33] all this is mine and so the bride of
[1:45:35] christ
[1:45:36] she looks at these things and she knows
[1:45:38] that tent vision is hers
[1:45:40] everything has been restored to her and
[1:45:42] will be if you can believe
[1:45:44] it amen if you can receive it if the son
[1:45:47] of man can be revealed to you
[1:45:49] amen as brother brown says you have to
[1:45:51] break into the heavenlies
[1:45:53] and see where you're standing amen so is
[1:45:55] it so with the bride of christ
[1:45:57] you got to break into the spirit because
[1:45:58] you can't say what the spirit says
[1:46:01] unless you're in the spirit and we ought
[1:46:03] to be in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:46:05] amen let's just stand
[1:46:10] amen those great
[1:46:12] doctrinal questions that are brought to
[1:46:14] the lord jesus christ
[1:46:15] he'd say but from the beginning it
[1:46:17] wasn't so
[1:46:19] well what was it like at the beginning
[1:46:21] i've come to seek and save those things
[1:46:23] that were lost
[1:46:24] to bring restoration how was it so at
[1:46:26] the beginning i've come to restore
[1:46:28] and now all that restoration that he
[1:46:30] talked about
[1:46:31] has been revealed again to a last day
[1:46:33] bryant
[1:46:35] who have received a message the
[1:46:37] supernatural message
[1:46:39] that that came with supernatural
[1:46:43] that was announced to the world
[1:46:46] through a prophet named william branham
[1:46:50] who had a humble ministry of doing
[1:46:53] something
[1:46:55] that no other man was doing
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:46:58] oh there might be impersonators
[1:47:01] like that something about that that the
[1:47:04] bride recognizes
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:07] i've seen that i've heard of that before
[1:47:09] that's just like my lord and savior
[1:47:11] jesus christ
[1:47:12] i've seen something that the son of man
[1:47:14] is being revealed
[1:47:17] and that's still happening the son of
[1:47:19] man is still being revealed
[1:47:21] that revelation is still there and we
[1:47:23] need it we need a day in
[1:47:25] day out every hour why because the more
[1:47:27] you stare into his face
[1:47:29] the more you are changed from glory to
[1:47:31] glory the more you look at his face
[1:47:33] the more you are changed the more you
[1:47:35] are perfected amen and we
[1:47:37] we look into his face as we get into our
[1:47:40] prayer closets
[1:47:41] as we list coming to church and listen
[1:47:43] to the messages
[1:47:44] as we worship him as we adore him as we
[1:47:46] bear witness to him
[1:47:48] we see his face continually amen as we
[1:47:50] see his face more and more
[1:47:52] we are constantly being perfected by the
[1:47:54] ministry of lord savior jesus christ
[1:47:57] amen going from glory to glory right now
[1:47:59] we are eating more and more grapes more
[1:48:01] and more grapes more grapes
[1:48:03] entering crossing over into that
[1:48:05] promised land saying get thee behind the
[1:48:07] scene
[1:48:08] this land is my land it belongs to me
[1:48:11] sitting with christ in heavenly places
[1:48:13] amen we might not be able to see it with
[1:48:15] these natural eyes all the time
[1:48:16] but oh my break into the spirit
[1:48:20] break into the heavenlies see where
[1:48:22] you're standing
[1:48:23] let these walls dissolve around you once
[1:48:25] more
[1:48:26] like they happened to gaheza oh lord
[1:48:28] elisha said
[1:48:29] open this young man's eyes and i pray
[1:48:32] that the same thing brother branham says
[1:48:33] open this bride's eyes so she can see
[1:48:36] where she's standing
[1:48:37] and all of a sudden her eye the bride's
[1:48:39] eyes were open said she surrounded
[1:48:41] amen a wall of fires round about
[1:48:44] jerusalem like zechariah saw
[1:48:47] amen zachariah
[1:48:50] you're the angel so they told the angel
[1:48:54] was given the commandment go measure
[1:48:56] jerusalem
[1:48:57] exactly just watch
[1:49:01] angel comes back i have done what you
[1:49:03] said to do
[1:49:04] jerusalem has been measured we know how
[1:49:07] wide it is
[1:49:08] we know how tall it is and here are the
[1:49:10] measurements
[1:49:11] and then the one that was speaking the
[1:49:14] righteous one said
[1:49:16] i know exactly how big it is i know how
[1:49:18] big the border is i know how big the
[1:49:20] walls are
[1:49:21] and let me tell you i will be a wall of
[1:49:23] fire around about it

[1:49:49] are they at go find them where are they
[1:49:51] at
[1:49:51] and the message went out to every single
[1:49:53] one of them and a wall of fire has been
[1:49:55] round about him
[1:49:56] why by the receiving of a message by the
[1:49:58] revelation
[1:50:00] that's how the wall of fire comes about
[1:50:03] amen
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:09] heavenly father i know maybe a
[1:50:10] mysterious message but lord
[1:50:12] all these scriptures all these
[1:50:14] prophecies come together and speak of
[1:50:16] one thing lord
[1:50:18] [Music]

[1:50:29] to a body change
[1:50:31] to a quickening spirit to a restoration
[1:50:35] to having the son of man being revealed
[1:50:37] to her to have her eyes
[1:50:39] wide open as that veil is ripped off and
[1:50:42] she sees her
[1:50:43] lord and savior who was crucified for
[1:50:46] the bloody lamb being revealed
[1:50:48] the mysteries revealed to her
[1:50:52] as she stands there she stands

[1:51:38] negative to the positive
