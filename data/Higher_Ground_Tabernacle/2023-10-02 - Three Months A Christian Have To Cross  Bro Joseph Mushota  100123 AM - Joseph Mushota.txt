they become worse than us I told I promise my friend in South Africa never go down until if I I won't be popular better I stay with two three people believe you know why that church was not many people there were not a powerful Ministry like William BR you think the truth is easy to take it you think like the truth is easy to take it no don't expect all people to praise the Lord when you want to stay with the truth you will never be popular but it's going to make you to be honest rather I be honest than popular with everybody hallu oh my my my Hallelujah I don't know I'm still watching the time guys you are pulling this morning praise the Lord I'm my small Title Here is a three M mountains a Christian have to cross the first Mountain was with Moses if we read that scripture God call Moses up but all this days God was talking to Moses God was when while was talking to Moses but it reach a time where God calling him up they used to talk god and why there is a time where they call him up the serious stuff want to start come up and the god start to speak to Moses now If You observe the walk the Journey of Moses Moses had a lot of challenges a lot of Israelite they come out from Egypt they were singing they were very happy when the message come a lot of people they come in the message just follow me carefully when I go there is about us don't there when they ask brother Bram why you you like to C Old Testament always why you always you love to cut I want to be a near right to be near right you must start there beginning because those physical Israelite physical Jewish whatever you can call it of Abraham is chist Isaac amen is a shadow Hallelujah that's where the good things start when you understand better Old Testament have a problem with a new testament you will never get Wrong by the always go there we must go there we the message we go there the message become very clear one day he said he was praying oh Lord like I am a I'm going to f the bright help me the angel to help me your bride where is is in the new testament old testament correct correct brother sister if you want to stay on the line in this message balance New Testament is about to Christ is lamb for everybody but a model Old Testament and this time when you get it right you never kick out Bram on your way if Rea kick out William Mario Bram let me put this way if a kick out now you understand what I'm saying I is going to meet Isaac going to me have to tell you have to show you the way meet [Music] hallu am Hallelujah you kick out on the desert you will never meet Isaac we are going to give we are going to bring back the prophet being the Propet I I'm helping one so two so me I don't believe in maybe I came here for only one I'm not there for exciting everybody just what is in my heart do you know the value of one converted Soul the value of one converted Soul one converted Soul 10,000 of this world we are living do you know is a value God can make you just to move for one Soul [Music] you some preacher they preach when there is 100 people when there two three I can preach one sitting there like there thousand to you we get get to you brother Hallelujah up

water and water fighting have you seen fire and the fire firing if there is a firing there is some fire some I'm going to give you one tips if you grow up spiritually a sign is love check in your heart this morning we don't want to quote too much I'm going to give quotation I love the prophets okay but I want to give you one tip is love if there is no love there's something wrong with you your place is at [Music] this message must bring love if the your message bring fight not the message of William is your message from I don't know most of the time I'm not popular preacher because because I always preach against everybody those they are not follow the message correctly why the number one killer is US preachers we are leading people in the bush go to microphones you've got speakers you can't answer back like I'm preaching now you can't I can talk Advantage whatever I can and remember it's a spirit it's a spirit you said I'm just sitting I don't know where to go you are destroing yourself you know don't be a coward stand with the message of the hour amen you must be able you eat the Flesh and you throw the bones grow up E when is born right to meet hard food we are the one we believe the message even if I don't understand amen amen amen before you finish the sentence I jump already I say Amen the food you must eat first and they start to give you the V the vitamins or ingredients but when you start I don't know I don't know if sour you got to eat it all praise God eat everything then you see things start to change automatically your hatred start to come out you

that's hot hot keep it brother don't go down hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah Moses walk of the message he has a challenges one the is own sister and the brother Aon and you think just only him God God can't use us God was angry God don't play with a prophet I'm warning you never make a mistake never make a mistake but mes make a mistake even his mistake God bless him that's why I'm telling you so if in the message there is no mistake why are you looking for the mistakes today I'm going to tell you something there is three mountains a Christian must cross this is included as preacher here in if I didn't go correctly here that's why you see someone ter in the message 40 years in the message they leave the message the followers they never believe the message that's where I'm going now it's a very deep uh sermons be with me so if you understand it you won't even have a problem with leave the message yeah it's the same with Moses in this time yeah that time the k c c so it's the same I'll take you to show the image there then you can understand what you are facing today let me the prophet say hallelujah praise the Lord and I want to say this I've never said this before but according to scripture according to what he said the 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just [Music] exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world for as John the Baptist was sent to for the first coming so is the message to for the second coming and John said behold the lamb of of God that takes away the sin of the world see so it it parall it in every way and I know it it where the message will go on Look Away to Jesus the message is going to introduce the second coming of Jesus Christ let me put this away oh William Bram if you didn't come we wouldn't be here if I can bring the same sentences now you feel like why say God why you say that critics in your mind when you you don't have a critics when there is a quotation you say first amen you know my attitude I know someone is Bram God I don't believe God Bram but when Bram God is reading the quotation I said first Amen brother said but you misunderstood him amen don't have a spirit of fasting with the quation that's what that's why Jesus didn't didn't tell the devil that it's not written it's written is also written oh my I love that he didn't say it's not it's written is also this is the message of the hour let me bring something one day was walking one brother feel deep love he said and like this they were walking same action another brother at the back just think about doing the same thing me also I can do that said don't do it this message is not about [Music] don't we make brothers they stop smoke they are not drinking sitting on the bench in the bench some they demons possessed some they demons possessed let me go deep again some are even if the devil but you are not allowed to call your brother a devil let me bring let me the Bible Jesus didn't tell the the per and all the disciples that Judas is not your brother he never said but he wasn't their brother only God have a right to say devil not you are okay but one of you devil not the demon possessed there are two things different devil and the demon possessed demon possessed we can pray Deliverance therefore even if

it's not only me the state state some they can like swallow when they speak English is like I don't understand some is a clear so it's it's not only me I noticed that some like the swallow word but have to I beg pardon can you repeat Hallelujah yeah God is pleasing everything praise the Lord okay I'm reading I'm wondering today it's what happen happening are we really getting the people to God or are we just getting them to church we must get them to Christ where this quicking power good to go to church sure it it does the far as we go it's not far enough when you when you come to church it's that's good that's good but go on to Christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that generation Resurrection correct because it's the only things that will ever bring us from the dead for it's the spirit that raise up Jesus from the dead dwelling in you it will also quickening make bring to life your promise to us hallelujah CL the hand for the Lord amen amen praise the [Applause] Lord this is it's for preachers we have also a role to play where are youing the people you know uh let's B said those people they go to the night club they listen to those music some people they can bring nightclub on the road that can be on the traffic light they just put those bases Bo I want this to be I want to go here they just bring night club on the road is next to you you can feel that so I don't know how he's surviving himself so those music no matter what they can singing they don't send they don't speak the word that go and kill go and shoot but they just said other words but the intention of that music there there is a small voice in The Voice amen though they don't say it that's why go straight in their music and go to those those young people and from the nightclub they went to shoot they start to kill people from theic intention behind the word it's very important that's why you have to choose even if the music you are listening Jesus you don't you don't know the intention of that Jesus they are talking about amen just check yourself there is a some gospel when you listen to it can't check yourself some music after listening to it some music you become nervous he say you you want to watch a movie which kind of music it send you to other feelings but it's a gospel this is the world we are living when sitting there you are not the real you you you are inside of this when we are preaching like here I'm not preaching for this man sitting here are preaching to your spirit I can I can tach only to your spirit I can touch but I can't touch to your soul only God that's why we create atmosphere to be in a good State of Mind the master to deal with your soul amen amen because it's about your spirit and your soul your spirit control your body control your spirit soul is the nature of your spirit am that's why I was following a lot of those business people billionaire to preach whatever cling out clocking out say sometimes I need something I can be free to help people praise the Lord hallelujah the princip they are doing those people is a Bible it's a Bible so sometimes you just kick people far away you start to judge them no they are using the principle of the Bible and when they using this and because the principle is not the devil put a principle God put the principle but yourself the Son of God you don't know the principle because you have criticized Spirit you start to criticize follow the Bible follow the message if you don't understand we like to talk to everything if we don't understand can we learn about just keep quiet when we don't understand the gospel work together with you like or not a lot of preacher are compromising because they are poor minded so when someone is
