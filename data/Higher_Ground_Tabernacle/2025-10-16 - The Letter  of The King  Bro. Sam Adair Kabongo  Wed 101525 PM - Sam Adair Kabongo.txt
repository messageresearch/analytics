I'm I'm a shepherd of a church in Katanga. and inumba and kasumba is on the border between the Congo and Zambia &gt;&gt; and that's where we serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's how we usually come here to America. &gt;&gt; And this time it pleased God that I be with you here tonight. in Iowa. &gt;&gt; And then I was invited by brother John. &gt;&gt; And when I came here, when I got here because even the Apostle Paul says that there are there are elders who are highly regarded in a city. There's an elder in the city who is highly regarded. &gt;&gt; And so that's why he brought me to an elder &gt;&gt; so I could uh present to you the uh present to you what I have &gt;&gt; and it was the first time that I meet the pastor &gt;&gt; and I really appreciated him &gt;&gt; and I really loved him. because I really felt the spirit of God in him. Amen. And as the prophet tells us that you can feel the spirits that somebody has just by talking to him for five minutes and without flattering you. I can tell you that you have a really good pastor and you have to support him as uh pro the prophet Brandham says you have to support him with everything that you have. And you also have to pray for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor, I really appreciate you. &gt;&gt; And may God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; It's the first time that I meet him. &gt;&gt; And the first time I meet him, he he allowed me to preach in his pulpit. No, not everybody does that. But I I believe that it did not just happen haphazardly. God knew everything. &gt;&gt; And that's why I bless I I I bless his name &gt;&gt; because he allowed us to meet today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I also thank And I also thank the pastor for giving me his pulpit &gt;&gt; and I also thank you for coming here tonight. And so God, God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; So let's stand. &gt;&gt; I believe that I'm just going to give you my greetings today by God's grace. Maybe he will come back again and we'll we'll fellowship together again. I won't that everyone speak to the Lord that you tell the Lord, Lord, speak to me tonight. Don't let a man speak to me. Amen. But I want you, the Lord Jesus Christ, to speak to me. Because if I speak to you, then my words will destroy you and kill me. But if it's Jesus Christ who's going to speak to you, then his words will give you life. The sickness sickness will turn into healing. Problems will turn into solutions and your requests will be answered because because it's Jesus Christ who's speaking. So let's pray. Just everybody say a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ our God, &gt;&gt; we give you glory, the honor. We give you glory. We go give you magnificence. &gt;&gt; We give you eternal dominion. tonight. &gt;&gt; We're grateful to you &gt;&gt; because uh because nothing happens by chance &gt;&gt; and so I I wanted that you come in this appointment. &gt;&gt; I want to shut up and that you speak to your people. circumcise my my lips and my mouth &gt;&gt; so I can only say what this the Holy Spirit will tell me to say &gt;&gt; anoints the the interpreter &gt;&gt; so he can be in the same symphony with me bless the pastor Brooks bless all the officers who work with us and bless all the church and bless all your servants who are in our midst. We cast out every evil spirit from among us. We cast them out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we invite you so you can take the control of this place so that when your word comes out, &gt;&gt; that your word delivers so that your word heals so that your word provides solutions. &gt;&gt; Start with us. and finish with us. &gt;&gt; Bless the reading of your word. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we prayed with faith for your glory. We say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, as we as we're standing, let's turn our Bible in the book of Daniel. I prepared something for Daniel. &gt;&gt; We're going to go to Daniel chapter 6. I think we may have to start from the beginning. &gt;&gt; But let's start from verse 24 of Daniel chapter 6. We go from verse 24 to verse 29. &gt;&gt; So I I'm going to read in this Bible Well, I'm reading a different version here, but we can all understand what &gt;&gt; Verse 22. Verse 22, my God has sent his angel and has shut up. Uh, verse 21, the English version. Then s said Daniel unto the king, oh king, live forever. My God has sent his angel and has shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me. For as much as before him innocency was found in me, and also before thee, O king, have I have I done no hurt. &gt;&gt; Then was the king um Not. [Music] Then was the king exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the dan. So Daniel was taken up out of the dan and no matter of hurts was found upon him because he believed in his God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the dand of lions, them their children, and their wives. And the lions had the mastery over them, and break all their bones in pieces, or wherever they came at the bottom of the of the dam. Now, let's stand while we continue reading. Let's sit. Let's sit while we continue reading. Now, this is where we get our theme. Uh, verse 25. Then King Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth, peace be multiplied unto you. Peace be multiplied unto you. &gt;&gt; I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of David. Amen. For he is the living God and steadfast forever. And his kingdom that that that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall not shall be even unto the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He deliverth and rescueth. &gt;&gt; And he workketh signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Wonders in heaven. in heaven and in earth who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. And to finish to finish with verse 28. &gt;&gt; So so this Daniel prospered into the in the reign of Darius and the reign of Cirrus the Persian. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. I believe it was a a lengthy reading but in this lecture we can find our food and our our drink in here. My title is going to be the letter of the king. We're going to talk about the letter of the king. And I believe you will understand by the end of the sermon what was the letter of the king. &gt;&gt; But I want that I want to get get the attention of everybody from the start because something can happen while we're talking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about Daniel. We talk about Daniel because there is a lot of revelations in the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; And I want that every one of you know that the thunders and the and the the seals that we all talk about all this time. &gt;&gt; The first prophet. &gt;&gt; The first prophet. The first prophet who ever saw all these signs, these thunders, it was the prophet Daniel. &gt;&gt; And he was even ready to open those seals. &gt;&gt; But God told him, "No, no, it's not. &gt;&gt; This is not reserved for you for you." &gt;&gt; He told him, "It's reserved for the time of William Brham &gt;&gt; because it's the pe the people that live in that time. they will be the ones that will receive those things. And here we are in that time. And when you read in chapter 11:32, it says that those who will know their God, they will do wonders. It's not that they will do it in the time of Daniel. the wonders that he's talking about is today. It &gt;&gt; it said that those who will read about those things their knowledge will increase that means that we're not living in a time of ignorance. In this time ignorance is not is not allowed because it was promised to us that when we know those things It said that the knowledge of the word of God will increase. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you that the book of Daniel is is a is a book of revelation. The same way that the book of revelation reveals things, the book of Daniel is also a book of revelations. Amen. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Now you will understand what happened in that time because you have to know that everything we've lived up until tonight. It was prophesied by Daniel. Now you all remember when Nebuchadnezzar saw this saw a dream, he talked about all those kingdoms that had to come after him. In that time, the Babylonians had to reign. And then after the Babylonians, there was the the Meo Persians, then the Greeks, and then the Romans. And then you will see that we we're seeing those things being accomplished according to how Daniel prophesied. And you can see where Daniel saw that the clay when we're talking about the king of north you can see that all those things we can see those thing being fulfilled right now. But that's not our subject because if we have to talk about it, we can stay here until tomorrow. I want to stay in the the letter of the king. &gt;&gt; Then you understand that everything that happens, everything that happens with Daniel in the beginning of the time of Gentiles. It's the same things that needs to happen at the end of the time of the Gentiles. Can some does somebody understand this? &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. Prophet really brother Brandham says that Daniel was the was the first prophet of the nations of the n of the gentiles. Now somebody will say well Paul was according to the church ages he was the first one. But brother Ram says Daniel was not a was not was not from the Gentiles but he was a Jew. But he said that the one who saw &gt;&gt; the one who saw the beginning of the Gentiles and the end was Daniel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I rather let's read it. I rather read it. &gt;&gt; I don't I want to complicate anything from the start. We have to when we when we go up with this, &gt;&gt; we we want to be on the same on the same spot in the same level. the beginning and the the end of the the Gentiles was preached in uh January January &gt;&gt; January 9th 1955 brother says he says in reality he says Daniel was a prophet of the Gentiles. He says Daniel saw the the the the beginning and the the and the fall of the age of the Gentiles age. &gt;&gt; He says he was the first one to be called the prophet of the Gentiles. himself was not a gentile, &gt;&gt; but he saw the dispensations of the Gentiles from the start to the end starting starting with the head of gold and ending with the feet of of clay. Can somebody say amen? Now I want to take you to the beginning of the Gentiles. Now listen to what happened. When God wanted to start working in the in the beginning of the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; he was looking for a man because he knows [Music] because he knows that he cannot work without a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God without man he's he's powerless for God to work he needs to use a man that means in the beginning of the the dispensation God found a man and that man was not just whatever manet he was a prophet that's that's the person he used in the beginning of the of the gentile And I want you to know that the name of Daniel the name of Daniel means God is my judge. That's that's the meaning of that name. In the name of in the name uh the name Daniel in that name there is there's a part of the name of God in that name because when you write the name Daniel the eel at the end of Daniel it's it's a it's a it's a form of Elohim. That means that in the beginning of the gentile age, God took a man &gt;&gt; and that man was a prophet &gt;&gt; and that man in his name he had a part of God in that in that name the pro the prophet says that the same way the prophet says the same way the gentile age started it has to end the same way as well who believes that we're at the end of the gentile time. And because we're living in the end of the gentile time, now we have to find evidences. We need we need to find out who is the prophet who needs to come at the end of the time of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; We find we look at we look at a man and that man his name William Brham. is that man that God needs to use at the at the end of the time of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; But when we notice in the beginning of their dispensation, &gt;&gt; we found that the name of Daniel had one part of it met God and to have an exact equation. the end time prophet as well. A part of his name also needs to have a part of God in it. Who believes that William Brham who believes that the the name of William Brham had a part of God in there. So if you believe it that means that he he has to be the prophet of the end time. He is the prophet that was used in the end the end time of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So listen to me carefully. &gt;&gt; Now us the Gentiles, we don't know the importance of a prophecy. But if you go in Israel [Music] in Israelites can demonstrate to you who's a prophet. &gt;&gt; I was in Israel. [Music] and we had a chaperon who was showing to us the importance of a prophet in nation. He was saying that us Jews, he says that when we see pro prophets, he said that us Jews when we see prophets, we see a divine visitation. And he told us that when we see a prophets, that means God is speaking to us and he's with us. And he said that if we don't have a prophet, it means that God has forsaken us. If the prophet is with us, He said that it means that God is with us. &gt;&gt; So go ask the Muslims. &gt;&gt; They will also tell you who's the prophets and the importance of a prophets. Let me tell you in Israel. You cannot speak against the prophets. You can be stoned for speaking against the prophet because they know that a prophet a prophet is the is the mouth that God uses to speak. And I want to tell you that at the end of this dispensation, God used the prophets again. And so when you reject that prophets, you reject God. When you listen to that prophet, you listen to the God Almighty. Now there's a problem today. &gt;&gt; People are rejecting the prophets, &gt;&gt; but they also want revelation. Well, those two things cannot coexist because the revelation is not does not come through the the preachers and pastors. But the revelation always comes through the prophets. Now let me tell you, when you reject the prophets, you have also rejected the word. You have also rejected the revelation. But when you accept the prophets, you receive the prophets. That means you have also received the revelation. That means you have received God. &gt;&gt; The prophet himself is not God. But but he represents God right there because he is the mouth that God uses to speak. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; If you don't know the importance of a prophet, then you can say anything you want. But when you know the secret of a prophet in a camp, then that means you are a strong. You're a mighty army. because that means there's somebody in the camp and that person he's the one he's the one who transmits all the words that come from heaven. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Now we're talking about Daniel. Look at the role of Daniel. You're going to see that. &gt;&gt; You're going to see that Daniel was deported from Israel to Babylon. He worked with the Nebuchadnezzar. Even though he was a slave, &gt;&gt; his prophetic quality was not taken away from him. &gt;&gt; He was the prophet of God. But he was above the magicians. He was he was the master of the magicians. He was above the astronomers. He was above he was their their boss. He was above all the divine divers. He was their boss. So that means that when the king wanted to to to wanted to get a revelation of something, the boss of all those divers, it was the prophet Daniel. Because the prophet Daniel had a true God while the other ones had little gods. I want to tell somebody this morning to tonight. Do not limit. Do not downgrade yourself because you think you're nobody. &gt;&gt; Despite all the powers you can you can meet. Whether it's magic, whether it's freemasonry, any other spirit. As soon as the spirit of God is in you, that means that you have a superior spirit. Because when Belasar Because when Darius noticed Daniel, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; the Bible says that they noticed &gt;&gt; that they noticed a superior spirit in Daniel. Let me tell you, I'm going to tell you the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God has always been a superior spirit. When you have a spirit of God, you are always above everything. The spirit of God is not a spirit of &gt;&gt; it's not a spirit of crying. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is not a spirit of lamentation. It's not a spirit of fear. When you have the spirit of God in you, you have a superior spirit. When you walk where demons are, every demon needs to bow down because the one who is in you, he's greater than all those magicians. The one who is in you is greater than the sickness. The one who is in you, he's greater than your ancestors. So when you have him inside of you, you can walk with your chest with your boss and chest. You can walk with your head high. Why? &gt;&gt; Because the one who is inside of you is greater than all kinds of spirits. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar worked with the Daniel. &gt;&gt; He found that Daniel was a a great a great man. his revelation. &gt;&gt; It was a person who was capable that when the king sees a dream and that the king doesn't know where where to find find himself and he calls all the magicians. He calls all the astronomers. He calls all those all the divers. asked them to remind him what he saw in his dream because he forgot about it. And the and the dividers told him that only man can reveal to you those things. Not a man cannot do it. He &gt;&gt; they told him when you were sleeping we were not with you. So then don't don't ask us to tell you what you saw in your dream because it's impossible. &gt;&gt; But there was a man in the camp. That man in the camp, &gt;&gt; he was able. &gt;&gt; He was able to say, "Oh king, live forever." &gt;&gt; He's what you're tell what you're saying, only God can do it. But that God is not going to do it in the air. I am the mouth of that God. So let me take some time to speak with that God and then I'll tell you what what what you have. So when the man came back, he gave the exact meaning of what the king saw in his dream. And we saw that with the prophets. Someone could go to the prophets. And he could tell him, "Oh, I saw some dreams. I saw when I was going down this this this road." Then brother Ram could tell him, "Stop. No, you forgot about a detail here. There was a stairs that was going this way. It means that it's the same spirits working. &gt;&gt; We have received a superior spirit. &gt;&gt; And when you receive a superior spirit, &gt;&gt; that means you also become superior. Let me tell you tonight that I'm not used to I'm not used to just say deity in one to put deity in one person. &gt;&gt; Deity started with God himself. Everything that was in God, God put it, God poured it into Christ. It was a de deity that was migrating to him. And everything that was in Christ, God put him here. But then listen to what a lot of people do. And a lot of preachers make this mistake. When deity start got here and they stop it there, they they put the key and they close it right there. They say apart from Brandom, nobody can do anything. No, that's that that's not true. I came here to tell you that deity did not remain in the prophets. deity that was here. Our prophets was the same deity lives in me. &gt;&gt; The same deity is in the pastor. &gt;&gt; The same deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? Amen. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; It's the same power. &gt;&gt; It's the same It's the same power. Jesus Christ is the is the great ocean. And when the ocean is full, that's that's the fullness of the gear. Brother Ram was when a um um a &gt;&gt; like a like a like a bucket. When a bucket is full, it's the fullness of deity in there. I have a spoon with my spoon. &gt;&gt; When that spoon is full, It is also the fullness of the deity. &gt;&gt; So deity is not does not stop right there. If brother Brandham raised the dead, that means I can also raise the dead. Amen. The deity and the prophet Brandham, he could turn his back. He could discern the thoughts. I can't do that. It was only him who can do it. But if diet could heal the sick, &gt;&gt; that means it can also heal the sick through me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Now listen to me carefully. The way that God works, he always works in a classical way. He He worked the world through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He worked in the age through a a major prophet and he and he works in the local church through a pastor. And so if you follow that leadership, you will never be disappointed. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Can we go forward? &gt;&gt; Can we go forward? Amen. &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar noticed that Daniel was superior. &gt;&gt; When his kingdom ended, it was the his grandson. Then Belazar took the kingdom and he also saw the same things because Baltazar could make a mistake. He could take &gt;&gt; he used the the the instruments of the temple to use it in a pagan party and a hand of God wrote something man who could translate that. There was only a prophet who could translate it. He was the only one who could translate those words. And it was through that that's when God decided on the end the end of the kingdom of Babylon and the Meo Persians had to to start when the Meo Persians started because they were smart Darius and Sirius because Babylon was was huge. &gt;&gt; Well, they said we're going to split we're going to split Babylon. I think in in verse in chapter six of Daniel, they said, "We're going to split the kingdom." &gt;&gt; And he says, "We're going to split it into 120 provinces." And he said, "We're going to give 40 provinces to each governors." And so they had to choose who was going to play the the role of the governor. They took two Babylonians. And so they saw that Daniel was above above everybody. So they took Daniel and they put him as a governor there. Now this was the beginning of the time town time of the Gentiles. Now now follow the spirits that started in the time of the the beginning of the time of the Gentiles. Those people can someone give me some handkerchiefs or something. Those people were here to to govern those provinces. And as they were um they had those pro they were leading those prophets they noticed something. &gt;&gt; So they noticed &gt;&gt; they noticed that Daniel &gt;&gt; they noticed that Daniel was was a right person. &gt;&gt; Daniel was not stealing. &gt;&gt; He was upright. He was not uh pro doing prostitution. Daniel was not lying. He was not accepting corruption. &gt;&gt; That's the spirits that was in the beginning of the the Gentiles. And so the those other two governors when they saw that they came to to Daniel they said Daniel they said Daniel can we do some corruption. Then Daniel said the law of my God does not allow those things. Then they asked Daniel, "Can we steal?" He says, "The law of my God does not allow that." They said, "Well, this man, he's uh he's [Music] he he's becoming uh he's becoming a disturbance to us. And so, we have to to create something. We have to create something to make him leave." Those are the same spirits working today. Because the same spirits that started in the the beginning of the dispensations, it's the same spirits working today. When you see a humble man, when you see that God uses that man, when you say you say you see that that person has has gifts, the same spirits that worked in that day, jealousy will come in, hatred will come in. They're going to try to kill this one and then terrible things will happen. And we are seeing the same things happening even in our churches. Now listen to what these people were saying. They said, "Well, this man, he doesn't smoke. This man is does not cost does not do prostitution. He doesn't drink because if if he smoked, we could give him cigarettes. If he was doing prostitution, we could use a woman. But he's not into all those things. So to get him, what are we going to do?" He says, "We're going to find we're going to find something in the law of his God." And that's what the devil does today. He will not attack you with prostitution if you're not a prostitute. He will not give you alcohol if you don't drink alcohol. But he's going to look for something. He will find something in the law of your God to destroy you. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; They went to see the king &gt;&gt; and then they see they find the king. &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh king, &gt;&gt; live forever." Now, now you see this thing of people lifting up mankind. No, that's that those are things that have been impact start that been caused since the time of the gent gentile at home. We used to say, we used to say live forever in our language. So to say live forever did not start today. It started since the beginning of the Gentiles time. They said, "Oh, live forever." They said, "Oh king, live forever. Live forever." So then the king is like, "What happened? I'm I'm going to live forever." What's happening? So be careful with people lifting you up. Be careful with people who flatters you because behind those flatteries there's something that can bring difficulties to you. The king says, "What is this?" They said, "Oh king. We notice that your kingdom has grown. We notice that you're the best pastor among all the pastors. And so we want you to become the bishop. We want you to become like the the bishop of everything and we want to start lifting you up. We want you to to to uh to hold all the generation to control all the generation. We want you to become the successor. That's the spirits working today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It did not start today. It started since the beginning of the gentile time. So then the king said, "Well, everything you're saying is good. So then what are you looking for after this?" They said, "Well, king, this is what we want." Because we see that you have grown so much and because we see that everything is going well. So we want to make a decree. We want you to to make a decree that in 30 days In 30 days, everybody will not worship his God. Everyone will worship you. We will lift you up. &gt;&gt; And the one who's going to worship another God, &gt;&gt; we want him to we want we want him to be thrown in the lion's. So, do you understand that the the the level of headship they created? They created one law to disarm the one man of God. One, only one. But those are things that we're living today. We, the brides, we are diminished at the government level, at work, in the law. They're always trying to do something to try to hurt us. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was already in the promise. Because what happened in the the beginning of the gentile time that is what's happening at the end of the gentile time. &gt;&gt; So the king said he says but you're coming two of you. There's three governors. So where's the other governor? They said oh king live forever live forever. So then he asked where's the other governor? He says no just live forever. The other one he's going to follow everything we're going to say. So the king says, "No problem." Because in the Meo Persian law, &gt;&gt; as soon as as soon as the king put his signature somewhere, &gt;&gt; he put his his ring on there and they seal it. The law can never be turned down. Now remember, it's the same It's the same law that that that put out vast It's the same law that put Vasti outside of the kingdom and and that's that's the same law that because the Meo Persians are are strict people and so with uh with uh the king accepted he accepted to put his ring and and they sealed it and no one could turn it down. &gt;&gt; So what where was the problem? That thing was done to to to hurt Daniel. They went to see Daniel. They already knew the times that he prays because Daniel was praying three times a day. As a true Christian, Daniel was always looking to the east before praying. And so they they looked at their their watch. They said, "It's in 20 minutes. He's going to start in 10 minutes." Oh, we we'll catch him. He He thinks he's the one who has God. We're going to get you. I want to speak to a child of God tonight. When you attack a child of God, &gt;&gt; you have to you're going to get you're going to get a &gt;&gt; they were playing with a child of God, but they did not know that a God was going to fight back. &gt;&gt; So they said, "Well, he's going to start in three minutes." They said, "This is the time." &gt;&gt; And so they saw Daniel open the windows. He b he he got on on his knee and he started praying. Oh, the God the God the great Jehovah. They said here here he is. They got they say oh Daniel we we got you. Say what you got me for. They told they told him did you not know that they made a decree. They made a decree that you cannot worship another god but the king. Then he says well I can't do something like that. So they take Daniel and they take him to the king &gt;&gt; and the king is at home and now listen people were saying oh king live forever. &gt;&gt; Then then he tell he told them are you coming back to this? What is this? They keep saying oh king we found a man he was worshiping another god. So then the king says just throw him in the lions there. What does the law say? &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh king, &gt;&gt; you have to see the person that we're talking about." &gt;&gt; So when the king comes out &gt;&gt; and he looks at his his most favorite person and he's he's that person, the family in that tribe. Then the king says, "No, we cannot do this. I don't I don't I reject this for Daniel only." They said, "Oh, king The letter was already written and that letter that letter cannot be turned down. Daniel will be thrown in the lion's den. Even yourself cannot return turn down this letter. I want to tell every one of you that the first letter that was written condemned you. The first letter that was written &gt;&gt; put you to death. The first letter condemned you in everything. The first letter even rejected eternal life from you. The first letter puts you in the sentence of the devil. But it was not over because the second letter had to come. Now let me tell you, problems can come, &gt;&gt; but it's only the first letter. The story is not over. Sickness can come, but it's only the first letter. The story is not over. All the complications can happen. Cancer can come. Depressions can come. Treason can come. But it's only the first letter. And the first letter can even decide my death. But as long as the second letter has not been validated, &gt;&gt; nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; I said nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The king said, &gt;&gt; Daniel, &gt;&gt; Daniel, &gt;&gt; I've always believed &gt;&gt; that you have a true God. &gt;&gt; So then, right now, &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not capable. I'm I'm unable. Now, this is a time that needs to happen to every Christian. The the the umbrella that you're expecting, &gt;&gt; the hope that you have that oh I I trust in somebody. God always wants to remove that that person that you trust because the hope of Daniel was the king. &gt;&gt; But in that day, his hope was taken away from him. So Daniel, &gt;&gt; can you guarantee me &gt;&gt; that the God that you serve &gt;&gt; is able to deliver you from the lion's den? &gt;&gt; So Daniel said, "Oh king, &gt;&gt; live forever. Let me tell you one thing. My God is the one who created lions." Let me tell you that my God, &gt;&gt; he is the creator. Even where there's impossibility, when my God comes down, impossibility becomes possibility. Let me tell you tonight that our God is more than able. Even where death already exists, God is able to turn death into eternal life. &gt;&gt; The saints say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; The king was guaranteed. The king says, "Now I see the things are going to change." So they took Daniel. They took him as a as a as a as a gangster. So they threw him in the lion's den. And when they threw him in the lion's den for for Daniel's enemy, the story was over. To them, the story was over. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says they even published. &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh, that man His ministry was already over. His story is over. &gt;&gt; Oh, Daniel. Who? Who's Daniel? Go ask in the lion's den. His story is over. Now, listen to me carefully. As long as your God has not spoken in your life, anybody can say a word. Even your father can say something. Your enemy can say something. Your enemies can say something but the story is not over because when he will speak his word will fix everything. &gt;&gt; Now listen the king left. The Bible says that in that day the king did not sleep with his concubines. He slept uh sad because because he had just lost if one his one of his favorite person and in the morning the king came &gt;&gt; he he came in the lion's and when he got there he he he screamed the same way Jesus Christ cried in in the in the tomb of Lazarus he says Daniel &gt;&gt; and when he cried so let tell you something first because even in the lion's den, God was still there. Even in the lion's den, God was still there. &gt;&gt; When they took Daniel, they put him in the lion's den. The lions came to devour Daniel. And the angel of the Lord, why the Bible says that that the angel of the Lord is the Lord himself. He stood in in the in between and that brother says it's the same way that when you have difficulties, God always sends his angel because the Bible says that the angel of the Lord in camp among those that fear him and he takes them away from every evil. When a danger you face a danger, God sends his angel and his angel always stands between danger and you. So when the angel of God stands between danger and you that means no danger can happen to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are under the protection. Disease can get you but you can can can can strike but it will not get you. The war can happen but you but it won't reach you. Why? Because the angel of the Lord stood in between you and that. So when the angel of the of the Lord stood in between the lions looked, &gt;&gt; they saw the creator. [Music] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh, this is the creator." &gt;&gt; And they they said, "We're going to listen to you." And those animals started even protecting Daniel from all those other animals that wanted to eat Daniel. God can even use witches in your family. &gt;&gt; And those witches become your protector because God used a bird to feed to feed Elijah. God can use your own enemy &gt;&gt; and they he can turn your enemy into your defenders. &gt;&gt; He is able to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Daniel wasn't was secure. Daniel could play with the lions. He could tell the lions, "Go do this." &gt;&gt; Daniel Daniel could find himself in Eden. He could tell the lion, "Do this." And the lions were following. They were obeying his instructions. And when the king called Daniel, the the the king heard there was a little silence because I have to tell you the silence of God does not mean that God is not listening. The silence of God means restoration. Because I remember in in Revelations when there was a silence of of a half an hour in that silence, &gt;&gt; it it was the whole deity that was leaving the heavens to come down on earth. It was a silence. I can even tell you the secret of the seventh seal is in silence. I'll tell you that when when when when Jesus when Jesus cried, "Lazarus, come out." There was a little moment of silence. That silence means a restoration is happening. The soul that left had to come back. The spirits had to come back and they had to to join the body. It was restoration that was happening. I will tell you tonight that all the prayers that she made Do not lose faith. &gt;&gt; You did not get it. Lose everything, &gt;&gt; but do not lose your faith. &gt;&gt; Do not lose faith. Lose everything. Do not ever lose faith in your prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if God did not answer today, he will answer tomorrow. If he did not answer late last week, he will answer next week. If he didn't do it this month, he will do it next month. Because when God gives, he always gives in a due season, he always good gives in in a good season. God does not give in a mess. And when God gives you something, no one can take that thing away from you. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? That's our God. The silence of God does not mean that God did not hear you. The silence of God does not mean that God is not seeing you. He's he's he sees you because he's always done that. I can see in Babylon the three Hebrews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedne when they were under that sentence of the king, the king of Babylon, they asked him to worship the statue of Daniel and they refused. And while when they refused, they accepted to die. Brother says they prayed, they interceded. Heaven was closed. But they did not know that in that silence there was a battle in heaven. Angels were walking walking in and while while they when they thought that they were in heaven there were angels. Michael could come. He he brings his sword. He says look what's happening. God send me and I'll go I I'll destroy that kingdom. God could tell him, "No, stay right there. That's my That's my problem." &gt;&gt; Amen. Gabriel could say, &gt;&gt; he says, "God, don't you see? Send me and I'll finish this." Gabriel said, "Stand aside. Absence could come." He could warm could come, could say. He says, "Remember that the flood I did this, send me, and I'm going to go finish that fire." God told Warmwood, "Stand right there &gt;&gt; for the for the the the salvation of my children. I don't send an angel. I need to go save them myself. There won't be an angel that that's going to go there. In that silence, God was working. &gt;&gt; Listen. It's when they they they were counting 1 2 3. That's when God was already in the fire. He was in the fire. I will tell you tonight, God sent me here to tell you that in your difficulties, in your distress, God has not fors forgot about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm finishing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Daniel responded. He says, "Oh king, &gt;&gt; live forever. The king said, "What? Daniel is alive. Daniel's alive." Then he calls everybody come. Come bring get Daniel out of here. He's alive. The Bible says that Daniel came out alive. He did not even have a scar. He was he was he was &gt;&gt; he was alive. Now listen, &gt;&gt; the first letter The first letter condemned in now listen about the second letter because the second letter is what your enemy is going to have tonight. He says, "Listen, Daniel, you need to write a letter right now and start writing. &gt;&gt; Me, the king of Babylon, I decide &gt;&gt; and I declare without uh all everything that happened that we wrote before. It's we're going to finish with that first article of that of that letter. &gt;&gt; The first letter says all other gods are no longer useful. &gt;&gt; The only God, &gt;&gt; the only God that can be lifted up, the only God that can be worshiped, The only God that we can worship is the God of Daniel. He says, "You told me to write what? Write down. It's the God of Daniel." I'm telling you to write this down. It's the God of Daniel. It was not over. He says, "Second article. Write down from now on all the enemies of Daniel, not just them, &gt;&gt; their children, &gt;&gt; their wives, they will be thrown in the lion's den. I love the God of William Brandham because the one who was the God of Daniel yesterday. It's the God of William Brham, &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; What he did yesterday, he can do it today. Amen. After writing the the the king's son, &gt;&gt; the the king put his his ring on there. He sealed it and the law became you could not turn it down. He wrote you. So when you play with a child of God, that's why when I when I I always tell those witches in Africa, I always tell them be careful because I tell them when you play with a child of God, You may think that it's an easy thing to do. &gt;&gt; Playing playing with a child of God, it's like you're playing with a gun. &gt;&gt; You see, when someone's playing with a gun, when someone's playing with a knife, so everything can happen when you play with it. Because when you play with it, a bullets can come can get into you. That's how the bullets got into the the the the enemies of Daniel. They captured the enemies of Daniel and they put them in the lion's den. The Bible declares that there was no angel to save them. They even broke their wounds. Listen, because &gt;&gt; because of the sin of one person, their children were also brought into it and their wives were also brought into it. Do you see the consequences that you get when you play with a child of God? A son of God is a thunder. You do not mess up mess with him and you just get rid of him. Get away with him. When you mess with a child of God, You you have to wait for God to fight back. &gt;&gt; Expect God to fight back. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you one thing. Jealousy. &gt;&gt; Jealousy is the demon that's destroying today. Because that demon started in the dispensation of the Gentiles. I'm going to read you a second quote here, then I'll finish from it. Jealousy is a is a bad demon. It's a very bad demon. &gt;&gt; Jealousy. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a bad demon. You're going to see that even from the start in the beginning when God created Abel and Cain. &gt;&gt; You're going to notice that in that time I'm in a sermon does God change his mind about his word? Paragraph 90. I'm going to I'm going to finish. &gt;&gt; If that kind of spirits is in you tonight, &gt;&gt; I want you to pray a lot because you find you find someone in church. Every time that person sees his brother, every time he sees his brother well-dressed, he feels bad. Every time he sees his brother pay his house, it it hurts him. &gt;&gt; Especially on the sister's side. &gt;&gt; You you find a sister who tells you, "I don't like that sister right here." Then you ask her, "Why don't you like her?" Then she then she says, "Every every time I see her, no, that's the devil." The prophet says, "Hatred comes from the devil. You have to be careful. As soon as you as soon as you start feeling a little bit of hatred towards your brother, know that it's the presence of Satan in you. Brother Brham says, &gt;&gt; he says, "Notice." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, "Notice." &gt;&gt; And it's always caused the natural to hate the spiritual. My brethrens, when you are spiritual, you will always be hated. When you do good, you will always be hated. When you are a good person, you will always be hated. Now, the problem is not hatred. The problem is to know who are those ones hating. It's those people who are carnal. Listen, brother Ram says, "It caused Cain to hate Abel. It caused Kora to hate Moses. It caused Judas to hate Jesus." And on and on. &gt;&gt; It causes the natural to hate the spiritual. Just as Cain in the beginning hated Abel, He says the one that God received the sacrifice and tries they tried to destroy them and tries to destroy them. [Music] Even they try to destroy the influence and destroy everything. Brother says because it's it's jealous. It's nothing but jealousy. It started in Cain and proved that it was jealousy. And it's still the same thing today. Today when the natural &gt;&gt; and the carnal and the spiritual meet together, it proves it's Satan no other way. &gt;&gt; Because jealousy comes from Satan and then causes an impersonation of the truth. Somebody somebody to try to impersonate something that he hasn't been that that he hasn't been ordained to do. He says, "How much have we seen today?" We have seen a lot of it today. &gt;&gt; My brother, jealousy is a bad demon. I I'm saying I insist it's a bad demon. Cain and Abel. Instead of doing like his brother did, he went to everything started by with jealousy. &gt;&gt; Moses, God called, God anointed him. God established him as a prophet. But but Kora Kora, they started criticizing. Does Moses think he's the only one here? So look how those people they did not die by the death that everybody died of. They were they were uh uh they were um they were they were swallowed by the earth. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you jealousy is not a good thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How is it that you are in church? &gt;&gt; As soon as you see someone dressing well You start you're starting to feel bad. That's jealousy and you don't even want to look at him. &gt;&gt; Now listen to what you say in your mind. You say, "Oh, he's prideful. Oh, he's prideful." &gt;&gt; No, he's not prideful. You You are jealous and you and Satan is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; We live in an age where poison is even uh in the church as well. &gt;&gt; Assassinations happen in church. What is it? &gt;&gt; Satan has come in our midst. In the beginning of the dispensation, it was the same way and we have to be careful that we put those things outside because we live in the times of wonders. I'll finish by saying the letter of the king today is the message of the end time because when the king wrote &gt;&gt; they wrote in in all languages you speak English they're going to write voice of God in English send it the the original seed the spoken word send it everywhere. where they send it. But they said you what language do you speak? You speak Chiluba? Write it in Chiluba. Send it to them. They said what language do you speak? Swahili. Okay. Write it in Swahili and send it to them. What language do you speak? French. Write it in French and send it to them. And as soon as you received the letter of the king, &gt;&gt; if you were worshiping idols, you had to throw them away because the letter is already telling you. &gt;&gt; We need to know the one who needs to to be worshiped. We need to know who needs to be lifted up. We need we need to know who needs to be worshiped. And it's only the Lord Jesus Christ. May God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We heard from the Lord tonight in such a special way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just hope that when he returns my calendar is open. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was blessed. &gt;&gt; And and that's so true because even people who follow the message still have not understood or understand that the only true living God &gt;&gt; is the God that William Brandom served. That's what we &gt;&gt; he brought us to true revelation of Jesus Christ and and that is definitely wonderful. &gt;&gt; And so when he first started, I mean where it was headed and I I I was already rejoicing in my soul because that that's nothing but truth &gt;&gt; and I was so blessed. because he didn't leave everything back there. He brought it all back to us. And that is the only true sign that if you truly believe what brother Brandon, you're living [Music] and his whole message about the Holy Ghost. God bringing you into a perfection. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; And I really appreciate our, &gt;&gt; you know, at the first I was nervous. I really believe God had me to ask him. &gt;&gt; Don't get mad with me now. But I don't trust all congalles. Preach us. &gt;&gt; So I was nervous. &gt;&gt; That's what you felt earlier. But I I want to say it like this. If William Brandon was here, &gt;&gt; see William, &gt;&gt; he would have been so well pleased the way he brought the message. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; So we thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, not prolonging the time. God has been so good to us. &gt;&gt; Anybody need prayer? &gt;&gt; You got some You got a lot tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you in the soul. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Are you blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing the long he abides. Amen. Trust you believe that. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk that pilgrim way for the hand of God in all my life I see. And the reason of my bliss, yes, a secret all is this, that the comforter abides with peace. Oh, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abide with me. I'm rejoicing night and day. As I walk that narrow way, Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. I'm sorry. Pastor Elonga, forgive me. Come say something. Y'all know me. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean to do that. It was on my mind to do it and then I totally forgot just that moment. &gt;&gt; So, we want him to say something. We appreciate our pastor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Give him a round of applause. May God bless you. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; I have just something to say. &gt;&gt; Just a prayer. I was uh so we were preparing to pray in the office. That's why I was going there. I believe with all my heart that there is a new letter in today today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe it and so something was recommended to us to do to do for everyone who listened to heard this today. And it was it's something we're going to do in the office. And so we're going to go in the office. We're waiting for you in the office. &gt;&gt; We love you and may God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we miss we we don't have enough words in the pulpit to say &gt;&gt; because they all they only seem to be words, but God knows the heart. May God bless you. I'm sure that we have all received. May God richly bless you. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh. Amen. Amen. He abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk that narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. Oh, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk that dare away. For the comforter abides with me. Oh, once my heart was full of sin. Once I had no peace within, till I heard Jesus died upon the tree. Then I fell down at his feet and there came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter abides with me. Yes, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk and dare away. For the comforter abides with me. Oh, he is with me everywhere and he knows my every care. I'm as happy as a bird and just as free for the spirit has control. Jesus satisfies my soul since the comforter abides with me. Yes, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk that narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. Oh, there's no thirsting for the things of the world. They've taken wings. Long ago I gave them up and instantly all my night was turned to day. All my burdens roll away. Since the comforter abides with me. Yes, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk that narrow way for the comforter abides with me.
