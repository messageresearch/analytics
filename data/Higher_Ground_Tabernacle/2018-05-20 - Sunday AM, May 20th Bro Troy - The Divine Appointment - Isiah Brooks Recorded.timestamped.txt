[37:59] can be seeing amen
[38:02] and as I said I want to speak a message
[38:04] this morning called the divine
[38:06] appointment you know brother Branham II
[38:09] he preached that at a message
[38:15] but Jesus keeps all of his appointments
[38:17] amen if you remember the remember the
[38:20] story he's talking about when Jesus was
[38:24] invited to go on down to the Pharisees
[38:27] house amen and and nor for the Pharisee
[38:31] - to make sure that Jesus would be there
[38:34] at the point of time that that he had to
[38:36] send a courier to go and make the
[38:39] appointment with Lord Jesus and this
[38:41] courier as he went he brother Brown kind
[38:45] of gives out the drama of how this man
[38:48] is being sent to seek after Jesus Christ
[38:51] and just think about that this man was
[38:54] well you know grew up he was in the in
[38:58] the service of the of the Pharisee and
[39:01] he had to attend services you know and
[39:04] all the things and he and he was always
[39:06] wanting to be about the Pharisees his
[39:09] master's business and here his master
[39:11] has told him I want you to go and seek
[39:14] after Jesus Christ baby didn't call him
[39:17] Jesus Christ but that is who he was I
[39:19] would go out and seek after this man
[39:22] Jesus of Nazareth amen and I know if I
[39:25] just leave us forever in those shoes if
[39:29] we could transport us back to that time
[39:31] and think about what a privilege it
[39:34] would be if we were told that we could
[39:36] go and seek out after Jesus Christ amen
[39:39] go find out where he is go find out what
[39:42] he is doing right now and go and deliver
[39:45] a message - amen
[39:47] you know if we could be you know in
[39:49] those shoes what a privilege that would
[39:51] be amen so this courier was sent out to
[39:54] find Jesus Christ and I see went out to
[39:58] seek after him you go from say to City
[40:01] Hall is he here no he just left but let
[40:04] me tell you you know you know I was sick
[40:06] but now anyway well anyway because
[40:08] they're everywhere Jesus was he left a
[40:10] trail of testimonies behind him amen
[40:13] even when he went into the town of where
[40:16] there was look where no one would hardly
[40:19] believe there's so much unbelief in the
[40:20] town he says he did few miracles but yet
[40:24] he still found somebody Amen that would
[40:27] give him a witness
[40:28] maybe it's just like this morning you
[40:30] know there's gotta be someone in this
[40:31] you know we don't know your every
[40:33] service you go to some you know seems
[40:36] like the spirit might have more freedom
[40:37] than others
[40:38] but yeah God has somebody that has to
[40:42] have a witness of his presence
[40:44] amen there's got to be someone at any
[40:47] given point in time there's gotta be
[40:49] someone that's gonna welcome him
[40:51] hey man jesus said if you will not
[40:53] praise me even the rocks will cry out
[40:56] amen so when God goes into a church
[40:59] whether he goes into a lively church or
[41:01] if he goes into a stone dead church
[41:02] there's got to be someone that's gonna
[41:04] give witness does something that Christ
[41:06] has done amen and so is it this morning
[41:10] right here all of us have an opportunity
[41:12] you know jesus said where two or three
[41:14] are gathered into my name I will be
[41:16] right there in the midst of them amen we
[41:19] all have that same opportunity right
[41:21] here there were Jesus Christ is here
[41:23] every time we come into this room we
[41:25] have that opportunity to know that we
[41:27] are in the presence of the Lord Jesus
[41:28] Christ amen all of us look set that
[41:31] opportunity in different ways amen some
[41:35] will take this opportunity after
[41:36] tradition
[41:39] amen some will will will be thinking in
[41:42] their hearts how long is he going to
[41:44] preach this morning you know some will
[41:47] some will say oh I wish he's on all the
[41:49] wrong songs a sore knee and I can't get
[41:52] into the presence of Laura because
[41:53] because that I didn't sing my favorite
[41:56] song others will come in and they'll
[41:59] hard you have a song in their heart amen
[42:02] others will come in and say this is my
[42:04] chance to hear from the Most High God a
[42:06] man some will come into this room and
[42:09] have their hearts prepared to meet God a
[42:11] man upon the sacred sands of of where of
[42:15] a promise where Jesus Christ have said
[42:18] the very one we've trusted I said I will
[42:21] be with you even in you until the end of
[42:23] the world but if two or three together
[42:25] in my name I'll be right there in the
[42:27] midst of them amen
[42:29] and as brother Branham he gave out this
[42:31] drama he said this courier he said boy I
[42:33] wish I could have been in his shoes I
[42:36] wish I could have been in his shoes if I
[42:39] would have found out where he was what
[42:41] town he
[42:42] was in I would ran up to him I would
[42:45] have forgot all about the message I
[42:47] supposed to deliver to him a man by I
[42:49] fell down at his feet and I have begged
[42:51] out for mercy I would have what like we
[42:54] sung there I would wanted to be washed
[42:55] like snow I would recognize that as
[42:58] being my opportunity that all my sins
[43:00] have been forgiven me amen if I had a
[43:03] sickness I could have been healed if I
[43:05] was bound in chains I could have been
[43:06] delivered if I could have just gotten
[43:08] into his presence
[43:09] that all things be made well amen but
[43:13] this courier as he went to deliver this
[43:15] message that this Pharisee was preparing
[43:18] a meal he wanted Jesus to attend to it
[43:21] that the courier had to go from a city
[43:24] the city seeking out the Lord Jesus
[43:26] Christ amen when he finally found him
[43:29] the courier you know goes up to the
[43:32] disciples and says I have a message for
[43:34] your master and they're yours the
[43:37] disciples say well he's rusty right now
[43:40] he's been really you know tired from the
[43:42] meetings and and you can't see him right
[43:44] now and the courier would say oh no but
[43:46] this this message is very urgent and if
[43:49] I don't get the message across I am I my
[43:52] master will it'll treat me poorly
[43:54] because I didn't fulfill my job I must
[43:57] get my message across a man is so II and
[44:00] so he's given a chance that all of us
[44:02] would love to have and as the disciple
[44:05] says okay you can you can go in you can
[44:08] you can go and he's resting right now
[44:10] but you can go in and speak to him as
[44:11] the courier goes in and he and he goes
[44:14] in and he goes in to the behind the
[44:16] curtain and maybe into the house where
[44:18] they're hiding Jesus because they had to
[44:20] hide him you know in order for me
[44:21] getting arrest they always had to hide
[44:23] him away somewhere so the people
[44:25] couldn't find him
[44:27] because the people knew that if they
[44:29] found him the people knew that if they
[44:34] could just find him they the promises
[44:38] would come to pass in their life amen so
[44:42] the disciples they had to hide him so
[44:45] that he could get some rest because the
[44:47] people were seeking after him so
[44:49] strongly because they were determined
[44:51] that they wanted the promises to come to
[44:54] pass in their life
[44:55] amen so as they are hiding the Messiah
[44:59] Amon as they're hiding the Lord Jesus
[45:01] Christ out in this house somewhere maybe
[45:04] on the border of the city as they we had
[45:07] to throw something over his head and go
[45:08] this way and run that way in zigzag this
[45:10] way is and before they could finally
[45:12] outrun even the the fastest children
[45:14] right amen they hide him inside this
[45:17] house and they and their but somehow
[45:19] this courier finds them and as he's
[45:22] resting then he gets in and slips in to
[45:24] give the message and this is the one
[45:27] opportunity he has it as Barbara said
[45:29] this may be the only opportunity this
[45:31] man will ever have to see salvation and
[45:35] he goes in and all he does is he says my
[45:38] master Simon would like to invite you to
[45:44] a supper at his house
[45:45] and he wants your assurance that you
[45:47] will be there and so Jesus being tired
[45:51] gives out so the assurance I will come
[45:53] and the courier I have done my duty I
[45:58] have done my job I've done all of my
[46:01] master required and he walks out the
[46:03] door walks out potentially into his
[46:06] eternal destination and it walks out the
[46:09] door amen and you know his brother
[46:12] branham you know if you remember
[46:13] sometimes he preached this message
[46:14] multiple different times but but he you
[46:17] know there's times that he would get
[46:19] really emotional as they only preached a
[46:21] message pride 1955 where he got really
[46:24] emotional when he was speaking along
[46:26] these lines he said if I could have had
[46:29] that chance I would have done it if you
[46:31] have just given me that chance to be
[46:34] there to be at the feet of Jesus to be
[46:36] in his presence if I could have just had
[46:38] that chance
[46:39] daven all of us have that chance amen
[46:43] amen just think about they had to hide
[46:45] the Lord Jesus Christ because the people
[46:48] were seeking out after him so much
[46:50] because they knew if they could ever
[46:52] find him that the promises we made
[46:57] manifest in their lives hey Melissa
[47:01] I just wanted to go through some of
[47:02] these promises I don't expect you to be
[47:05] able to turn Dean the script all the
[47:07] scriptures here but but
[47:09] about seven promises I just wanted to
[47:10] read through real quick you know in
[47:13] genesis 3:15 I'm not gonna call every
[47:16] scripture but one of the promises one of
[47:19] the prophecies of Jesus Christ was that
[47:22] he would crush the Serpent's head
[47:24] amen amen who would like to have the
[47:27] Serpent's head crushed in their life I
[47:29] even think about it he the Lord Jesus
[47:32] Christ he was prophesied as this serpent
[47:35] slithers up into your life amens he
[47:38] tries to bring the chains as he tries to
[47:40] bring the bondage as he tries to get you
[47:43] to stumble into sin as he tries to get
[47:45] you to stumble into sickness he says
[47:47] that this this Lord Jesus Christ who has
[47:49] come a man who will crush that Serpent's
[47:52] head a man that's one of the promises
[47:55] amen remember they were running after
[47:58] Christ seeking to see the promises made
[48:01] per manifest in their life amen
[48:04] another promise was was you know just as
[48:07] a t18 that that all in all that in the
[48:11] and this the in Abraham all the nations
[48:14] were blessed by him amen amen
[48:17] also you know when the Isaac was born
[48:21] that he would establish his everlasting
[48:23] covenant in him a man that in this
[48:26] Messiah in the seed of Abraham all
[48:29] nations would be blessed
[48:30] amen who would like to inherit that
[48:32] blessing a man now what kind of blessing
[48:35] did Abraham go have everywhere he went
[48:38] he was led by led by the spirit he was
[48:42] led by the Holy Ghost he was drawn out
[48:45] of his house of idols amen he is washed
[48:47] he was sanctified he was drawn out into
[48:50] a promised land and goes with them
[48:52] everywhere he went
[48:53] amen and those promises are unto you
[48:56] amen
[48:57] he said and I will give you an
[48:59] everlasting covenant another one the
[49:01] promise was Isaiah 9:7 it says and of
[49:03] the increase of his government and peace
[49:05] there shall be no end amen his of his a
[49:10] increase of his kingdom there shall be
[49:11] knowing that means if you've ever once
[49:13] had his kingdom in your life maybe if
[49:16] you've ever once had the Dominion of
[49:18] Lord Jesus Christ in your life that
[49:21] demeaning is going to
[49:22] Amen that's going to go from glory and
[49:25] the glory amen and the increase of his
[49:28] kingdom there will be no end what is
[49:31] that a promise these aren't just
[49:33] fairytales amen these are promises amen
[49:37] and they were running after the Lord
[49:39] Jesus Christ seeking to find him so that
[49:41] these promises to be made manifest in
[49:43] their life amen he said Isaiah 7:14 said
[49:48] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[49:49] unto you a sign behold a virgin shall
[49:52] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[49:54] his name Immanuel Immanuel means God
[49:57] with us amen not just the God up in
[50:00] heaven not just the one there's over on
[50:02] the other side of the sea not just the
[50:04] one as there in the holiest of holies
[50:07] but he's the one that he's right there
[50:08] with you
[50:09] amen and not just there with you but
[50:11] he's called you to come come in with me
[50:13] come in like he said uh in Song of
[50:15] Solomon come into me you know seek me
[50:19] where I am
[50:20] amen amen and Isaiah 91/2 says the
[50:24] people that walked in darkness have seen
[50:26] a great light they that they that dwell
[50:29] in the land of the shadow upon them at
[50:31] light shine amen his Psalms 110 for says
[50:36] the Lord has sworn and will not repent
[50:38] thou thou art a priest forever after the
[50:41] order of melchizedek we have a priest
[50:43] has been given to us amen and this
[50:45] priest knows how to handle the sacrifice
[50:48] amen the sacrifice he gave is for
[50:50] sickness it's for sin it's for shame
[50:53] it's for iniquities it's for
[50:55] transgressions it's for nakedness as for
[50:58] being bound amen is for whatever problem
[51:01] we have need of that's what this
[51:02] sacrifice is for and the high priest
[51:04] knows how to handle the sacrifice amen
[51:10] the last one okay this was Isaiah 53
[51:13] four and five surely he hath borne our
[51:16] griefs if carried our sorrows yet we did
[51:19] esteem him stricken and smitten and
[51:21] afflicted so if we have griefs and we
[51:23] have sorrows Christ died for that amen
[51:27] but he was wounded for our
[51:28] transgressions he was bruised for our
[51:31] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[51:33] was upon him and with His stripes
[51:36] types we are healed amen so if any of us
[51:39] has any transgressions if a u.s. hasn't
[51:42] even acquittees a man if anybody if he
[51:45] voice has lost our peace amen if anybody
[51:48] has any sickness then he'll sacrifice
[51:51] and the Lord Jesus Christ was well it
[51:53] was fulfilled for you
[51:55] amen amen he bear the sin of many and
[52:02] made intercession for the transgressors
[52:05] amen
[52:06] and that's what they were running after
[52:08] to get amen they were running after to
[52:10] have their healing there right after him
[52:12] for their deliverance
[52:13] amen amen he and he gave us these
[52:15] promises now I want to speak this
[52:17] morning on the divine appointment
[52:20] brother Branham said that Jesus Christ
[52:23] keeps all of his appointments all of his
[52:26] appointments every single one of them
[52:29] they meant Jesus Christ brother Branham
[52:32] he said this little oh he says Jesus
[52:34] keeps every appointment he even leaves
[52:37] glory a little early so he can get here
[52:41] on time hey man just to paint the
[52:44] picture for you he even leaves glory a
[52:46] little early so he can get here on time
[52:51] Jesus Christ is interested in being here
[52:54] this morning
[52:55] amen Jesus Christ before we even woke up
[52:59] this morning Jesus Christ had on his
[53:01] mind that he needed to be in this room
[53:04] by the time two or three gathered in his
[53:06] name because all of heaven and earth is
[53:10] hanging upon every word of God
[53:12] and he could not let that word fall so
[53:14] when Jesus Christ made the promise as
[53:16] men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost
[53:19] to write down the things that Jesus said
[53:21] or write down what the Spirit was
[53:23] telling them and they wrote down the
[53:25] jesus said that wherever two or three
[53:27] are gathered in my name I will be there
[53:30] right there in the midst of and all of
[53:32] heaven is behind that Scripture come to
[53:34] pass so we know we can look around this
[53:38] room my natural eyes do not declare or
[53:45] see that the Lord Jesus Christ is here
[53:47] but let me tell you actually my natural
[53:49] eyes
[53:49] do declare now when your natural eyes
[53:53] have been given over to be bound by the
[53:57] gospel to be bound by the Spirit is my
[54:00] natural eyes have glanced over this
[54:02] verse where it reads where two or three
[54:04] are gathered in my name there I'll be
[54:06] right there in the midst of it so then
[54:09] even so me my eyes they don't see a man
[54:12] in here with holes in his hands or with
[54:14] a white garment on him but by by the
[54:17] very fact I had the scripture open in
[54:19] front of my eyes have read the scripture
[54:23] and that has gone into my mind and I and
[54:25] it's gone down and there's something
[54:26] down in my soul that believes that
[54:29] scripture hey man that's how this gospel
[54:33] is there's something down in our soul
[54:34] that it is not it's not unbelief but
[54:37] it's bleep hey man brother Branham said
[54:40] that there's only two things in the soul
[54:41] amen there's there's either faith or
[54:45] unbelief amen you either believe or you
[54:49] don't believe a man so when you - so
[54:52] with this so the scripture runs across
[54:54] the heart of a true believer
[54:55] you're either believing or you're
[54:57] disbelieving now the Bible said that
[54:59] that where two or three are gathered in
[55:01] my name right there that I'll be in the
[55:03] midst of hey man I see so here that was
[55:06] a witness at their baptisms amen where
[55:08] they are baptized I now baptize you in
[55:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[55:13] and what two or three will bind on the
[55:15] earth the Bible says I will bind it in
[55:17] the heavens amen so as we as we bind a
[55:20] minute the people in the water and
[55:22] they're in agreement I am dying my sins
[55:25] I am dead to the past and I'm a live
[55:27] unto Christ Jesus amen we're binding
[55:29] that here on the earth
[55:31] Jesus says I'll take that same thing
[55:33] I'll bind it up in the head of a man who
[55:35] says all you even write your name upon
[55:37] your my name in your forehead Amen so we
[55:39] are gathered here in his name a man who
[55:43] there's more than 2 or 3 rows and we've
[55:45] gathered right here in his name that's
[55:48] why we treat this room with sanctity
[55:50] hey man that's why we come in here with
[55:52] the humblest we don't coming out here
[55:54] out of tradition hey man we all come out
[55:56] of here with thoughts evil one towards
[55:59] the other but when we come in here we we
[56:01] forgive one another
[56:03] hey man we all hold grudges against
[56:06] another we all say oh this person should
[56:08] have done this a little bit better or
[56:09] this person that on this a little
[56:11] better
[56:11] or I wish so-and-so would do this or
[56:13] so-and-so do that no but we have
[56:15] forgiveness one for the other
[56:17] amen we wash it to each other's feet
[56:19] amen
[56:20] day by day if we aren't doing in the
[56:22] natural we can still do it in the
[56:24] spiritual where are we washed our
[56:25] brothers and sisters speak amen
[56:27] the iffy the dirt of the world gets on
[56:29] their feet amen
[56:30] we know that Christ sorry wash their
[56:32] soul but but we'll wash one another's
[56:34] feet amen amen
[56:36] things that maybe Satan would tempt us
[56:39] to blame one another for we say no we we
[56:42] resist that thought amen we wash our
[56:44] brothers and sisters feet why because we
[56:46] know that when we gather into this room
[56:48] amen we're gathering in his name and we
[56:51] don't want to come into this room being
[56:53] found having grudges one for the other
[56:55] because we're in divine presence amen we
[57:00] came in when we came into this room we
[57:01] were coming into divine presence Amen
[57:04] why because we made an appointment with
[57:06] him there's a divine appointment where
[57:09] Jesus Christ said I will be right there
[57:11] in the midst of you he said where two or
[57:15] three are gathered in my name I will be
[57:17] right there in the midst and here we are
[57:22] so here he is hey man I just wanted to
[57:25] as you know when when when that courier
[57:27] went to chase after the Lord Jesus
[57:29] Christ he had to go from city under city
[57:33] looking for him and everywhere he went
[57:36] after Jesus left the city he left behind
[57:39] two different types of people those that
[57:42] were driven away in unbelief and
[57:44] hardness of heart and those that were
[57:47] set free
[57:48] I know those that used to be bound were
[57:51] loose a man knows the the poor had the
[57:54] gospel preached unto him amen those that
[57:56] were in in prison were released from
[57:58] their sins they meant aiming because he
[58:00] said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[58:01] me because he has anointed me to preach
[58:04] the gospel he is ignoring me to prutte
[58:06] to loose the bounds of those that are in
[58:08] prison they meant so where that Kerry
[58:09] went he just finds somebody that Jesus
[58:12] had touched a man the same thing this
[58:15] morning when we leave
[58:16] service this morning there's me somebody
[58:18] that Jesus is such a man there's gonna
[58:21] be somebody that chased after him the
[58:22] same way that career did but instead of
[58:25] just trying to do some natural thing you
[58:28] chased after the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:29] because you had something upon your
[58:31] heart a man you had something a reason
[58:34] for chasing after him
[58:35] amen - if you chase after Jesus Christ
[58:37] has got to be a reason amen you got to
[58:40] have a reason down on the inside a man
[58:43] there's got you you need something from
[58:45] him or you just want to thank him for
[58:47] something that he's done for you or you
[58:49] want to praise him for things that he's
[58:51] brought you through or the goodness he's
[58:53] given in your life amen or the or the or
[58:55] the blessings they've given in your
[58:57] house amen amen or for saving your soul
[59:00] and you were lost
[59:01] amen you don't have to be one of these
[59:03] drug addicts out on the street anyway
[59:05] you don't have to be lost in sin and
[59:07] iniquities you don't have to be you know
[59:08] that why because Jesus Christ has set
[59:10] you free
[59:11] Amen so he gathered in this room to
[59:13] thank him for those things amen amen
[59:19] amen you know we feel like we were
[59:23] separated by time you know 2000 years
[59:28] maybe we've been separated from the from
[59:31] the the blessings of his presence well
[59:36] that's not true he said I will be right
[59:38] there in the Mississippi you know in st.
[59:41] Paul was writing the book of Hebrews and
[59:43] the Bible says as men and old were
[59:45] anointed to write the gospel as the Holy
[59:49] Spirit move upon them to write and as
[59:51] st. Paul began writing he brews chapter
[59:54] 13 that we call it Hebrews 13 and as he
[59:57] started writing verse 1 verse 2 verse 3
[1:00:00] he got down to the fifth verse the sixth
[1:00:02] Merson well he started writing and he
[1:00:05] finished writing the chapter or verse
[1:00:07] seven and all sudden the Holy Spirit
[1:00:09] moved upon him he says tell them tell
[1:00:11] them not in the same yesterday today and
[1:00:14] forever tell them so that they will know
[1:00:16] break right here in the middle of this
[1:00:18] thought your favor notice that scripture
[1:00:20] doesn't really doesn't really seem to
[1:00:22] mesh too much with the stripper's before
[1:00:23] the scriptures after you try to place
[1:00:25] you like what does the scripture doing
[1:00:27] here but the Holy Spirit moved upon the
[1:00:29] apostle
[1:00:30] that is he is writing out verse seven
[1:00:31] the hoist spirit all sudden moves down
[1:00:33] into the room tell them right now tell
[1:00:36] them that I ain't gonna be the same
[1:00:37] yesterday today and forever hey man when
[1:00:41] we read that scriptures we take it to
[1:00:43] heart we say Jesus Christ will be the
[1:00:45] same every day maybe I saw this day and
[1:00:47] might May 2018 that that prophecy has to
[1:00:50] come to pass that he'll be the same
[1:00:52] right now amen otherwise the scripture
[1:00:56] will fail but just like it was back then
[1:00:58] and so is it now every city that he went
[1:01:00] into it drove a division of some that
[1:01:04] believed and experienced his presence
[1:01:06] the blessings of his presence and some
[1:01:09] their hearts were hardened brother Brian
[1:01:11] said every church service you go to you
[1:01:13] either be closer to the Lord or you'll
[1:01:16] be further away from him a man so every
[1:01:20] single one of us just because we came
[1:01:22] into this room into divine presence will
[1:01:25] leave out this door here and a little
[1:01:28] bit of time we'll leave out that door
[1:01:30] right there when we go through those
[1:01:32] curtains we're there to be closer to the
[1:01:33] Lord than we came in or will be just a
[1:01:36] little bit further away a may will there
[1:01:38] be like that courier who had a chance to
[1:01:41] throw his feet at the Lord Jesus and
[1:01:43] speak or will be like the woman who was
[1:01:46] the alabaster box a man we think our
[1:01:49] when he got when that when the when
[1:01:50] Jesus kept his appointment and he showed
[1:01:52] up at Simon's house Amen as he said that
[1:01:56] he wasn't greeted he wasn't loved he
[1:01:58] wasn't treated right and he set off over
[1:02:00] in the corner with speed unwashed and
[1:02:02] he's sitting there with dirty feet and
[1:02:04] as that woman of ill Fame we've had saw
[1:02:08] that she went and bought the alabaster
[1:02:10] box and spent all her living you know on
[1:02:12] the Oh on the precious ointment and she
[1:02:16] went into the room and as she knelt down
[1:02:18] behind him and she was trying to could
[1:02:21] she was trying to hear how to get the
[1:02:22] Box open and she's got frustration she
[1:02:24] just broke the thing open and and and
[1:02:27] and and it started anointing his feet
[1:02:29] and wiping his feet with her heron and
[1:02:31] she all sudden everybody in that room
[1:02:36] was in the midst of a worship service
[1:02:41] I meant suddenly when that when that
[1:02:44] odor of that of the present says you'll
[1:02:47] is that that only had been in our box I
[1:02:50] don't know how long but however long it
[1:02:52] in that box that that pointment had been
[1:02:54] mixing and impregnated the molecules of
[1:02:57] the air inside that box so thick it's so
[1:03:00] heavily with the ointment that when the
[1:03:01] box broke open that the that the
[1:03:04] atmosphere inside that box started
[1:03:06] floating through the entire room and all
[1:03:08] sudden they started smelling the odor
[1:03:11] and they recognized that that was an
[1:03:13] expensive floater that was an expensive
[1:03:15] price this woman is giving her all to
[1:03:19] this Jesus and everybody was all sudden
[1:03:22] thrown whether they wanted to be or not
[1:03:24] everybody he was suddenly in the midst
[1:03:26] of worship service amen but you know
[1:03:30] only two could enter into that worship
[1:03:32] service the whole room was in a worship
[1:03:35] service but in reality when you look
[1:03:38] back with with spiritual eyes everybody
[1:03:41] else just fades away because there was
[1:03:43] just the woman and her Savior a man it's
[1:03:46] the same thing at every worship service
[1:03:48] that we have in this room every single
[1:03:50] one without fail amen every single
[1:03:54] worship service in this room happens
[1:03:57] just like that hey man you may not
[1:04:00] realize that you may not recognize it
[1:04:02] but every worship service I don't care
[1:04:04] what you think about the worst service
[1:04:06] every worship service that we have in
[1:04:08] this room happens exactly the same way
[1:04:11] there is no difference none no
[1:04:14] difference at all it's a gathering
[1:04:16] together in a room hey man there's two
[1:04:18] or three are in his name amen to the
[1:04:20] presence is here amen and as people
[1:04:23] begin to worship the presence but the
[1:04:25] problem is as some people get locked
[1:04:27] outside of the worship service and some
[1:04:31] people get locked on the inside of the
[1:04:34] worship service amen it's a divine
[1:04:36] appointment that Lord Jesus Christ has
[1:04:38] made I will be right there in the midst
[1:04:40] but some get locked on the outside
[1:04:43] because they just cannot seem to to to
[1:04:47] break through that darkness I can't seem
[1:04:49] you know all the darkness that they've
[1:04:51] allowed in their lives of the things
[1:04:53] that they've watched
[1:04:54] the things that they've heard the things
[1:04:56] that they've allowed across over their
[1:04:58] minds and as they come into the worship
[1:05:00] service they get locked on the outside
[1:05:02] because they can't seem to to surrender
[1:05:05] themselves to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:07] so as the worship service goes on as
[1:05:10] people begin to enter into the presence
[1:05:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:13] they're stuck on the outside because
[1:05:15] they just don't know how to worship
[1:05:18] their Savior they they don't know how to
[1:05:24] worship their Savior they they don't
[1:05:27] seem to recognize all that he's done for
[1:05:29] them they don't know what he's capable
[1:05:32] of
[1:05:34] they've allowed some thick blindness to
[1:05:37] come over them and they don't realize
[1:05:38] that they're in the presence of the one
[1:05:40] that created the heavens and the earth
[1:05:42] and they don't realize that they're in
[1:05:45] the in the presence of the one that
[1:05:47] created the earth that they stand upon
[1:05:49] that created men and women to love one
[1:05:52] another a man that created a family is
[1:05:54] to care for each other they are realize
[1:05:57] that they're in the presence of the one
[1:05:58] that that created men and women to have
[1:06:00] fellowship in the gospel anyway they'll
[1:06:03] realize that they're in the presence of
[1:06:05] the one they created men and women to
[1:06:07] come and worship Him in a Garden of Eden
[1:06:09] and they're there in the presence of
[1:06:12] that one that did all those things and
[1:06:14] yet they can't seem to find themselves
[1:06:16] to get into the prep the Garden of Eden
[1:06:18] they can't get into his presence safe
[1:06:20] they don't recognize they've become
[1:06:22] blind they've become that their eyes are
[1:06:25] blinded to these things and all sudden
[1:06:28] they're locked on the outside of the
[1:06:30] worship service the time hasn't changed
[1:06:34] that carrier when he when they he went
[1:06:37] from city to city he found out that
[1:06:39] Jesus Christ was the same in every city
[1:06:41] as that carrier went looking for Jesus
[1:06:45] Christ he heard similar testimonies the
[1:06:48] Lord is a healer the Lord is the
[1:06:50] deliverer the Lord will set you free the
[1:06:52] Lord will do this the Lord he is the
[1:06:54] king of he is a king we've been waiting
[1:06:57] for he is the Messiah
[1:06:58] amen and he's coming the East kasaya
[1:07:01] then we the way for us here and as he
[1:07:03] heard testimony after testimony he found
[1:07:06] out that Jesus Christ was the same in
[1:07:07] every city
[1:07:08] amen amen some to a greater extent some
[1:07:11] to a lesser extent the baby how he was
[1:07:13] received but no matter how well he
[1:07:15] received or how lil here's receipt even
[1:07:18] in the city were with a little smallest
[1:07:20] amount of faith the Bible said that he
[1:07:21] did few miracles that means that he did
[1:07:24] something Amen as so is it the same this
[1:07:27] morning a man there and there may be few
[1:07:29] believers here this morning there may be
[1:07:31] many believers here this morning and
[1:07:33] maybe there's people with their eyes
[1:07:34] wide open and maybe there's many with
[1:07:36] their eyes closed but guaranteed
[1:07:37] somebody because of the presence of Lord
[1:07:40] Jesus Christ in this room somebody's
[1:07:41] gonna get something
[1:07:43] amen it may be many it may be few I
[1:07:46] don't know but guaranteed Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] is here he's in the city Amen if that
[1:07:51] courier would have followed him from
[1:07:53] that city over to this city he would
[1:07:55] find out the same thing the same
[1:07:56] testimony Amen we guess Christ is here
[1:08:00] and when Jesus comes he heals when Jesus
[1:08:04] comes he delivers when Jesus comes he
[1:08:07] sets free amen when Jesus comes he he
[1:08:10] binds up the brokenhearted a man because
[1:08:13] he said the Spirit of the Lord God is
[1:08:14] upon me to bind up the broken heart a
[1:08:16] man so if you're here and you are bound
[1:08:18] if you're here and you have the chains
[1:08:21] on you if you here and you are blind and
[1:08:24] cannot see and cannot recognize his
[1:08:26] presence can't feel it realize that he's
[1:08:29] in the room if you're here and you and
[1:08:31] your brokenhearted and you can't can't
[1:08:33] seem to get yourself out of this
[1:08:35] oppression but let me tell you that
[1:08:36] Jesus Christ is here a man because he's
[1:08:40] here he's going to be the same Amen but
[1:08:43] it's up to us will we chase after him
[1:08:45] like that courier did we chase after him
[1:08:47] like the children they were running
[1:08:48] after him in the streets amen amen he's
[1:08:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:56] the Saint Paul wrote a minister to the
[1:08:59] Book of Amos they may want to read a few
[1:09:04] scriptures here from Amos chapter 4 and
[1:09:08] then also from Amos chapter 5
[1:09:15] Amos is the four Obadiah draft of the
[1:09:20] book of Joel Amos chapter four verse
[1:09:26] seven and eight
[1:09:39] says and also I have withholding rain
[1:09:42] from you when there are yet three months
[1:09:46] to the harvest and I caused it to rain
[1:09:50] upon one city and caused it not to rain
[1:09:54] upon another city a one piece or field
[1:09:59] one piece was rained upon and the peace
[1:10:03] whereupon it rain not
[1:10:05] withered and so two or three cities
[1:10:09] wandered unto one city to drink water
[1:10:12] but they were not satisfied yet
[1:10:15] II have not returned unto me saith the
[1:10:18] Lord
[1:10:19] a man will go on to Amos chapter 500
[1:10:22] minute but but what Jesus what Lord
[1:10:24] saner is he picture you know three or
[1:10:28] four cities in the land and God by His
[1:10:31] divine mercy and grace he allows its
[1:10:35] rain upon one city but at these two
[1:10:39] cities over here rain dry and so this
[1:10:46] city over here will be rejoicing for the
[1:10:49] blessings of the rain and he is three
[1:10:53] months to the harvest when the really
[1:10:56] start growing into his strength the crop
[1:10:58] has been growing to its strength and
[1:11:02] once he's getting the rain and their
[1:11:03] crops are growing another see he's not
[1:11:06] getting the rain and theirs are gonna be
[1:11:09] stunted and wither and die and so the
[1:11:13] two cities will wander and leave their
[1:11:16] cities behind and go and look for the
[1:11:19] city where there's rain so they can get
[1:11:22] water for their thirst and yet they'll
[1:11:24] leave a way from there and they still
[1:11:26] won't be satisfied because their City is
[1:11:28] still dry hey man so as a soul in a
[1:11:31] church service when God will rain upon
[1:11:34] one city they meant one person boy
[1:11:39] spirit will be one person will just be
[1:11:41] in tears almost as in the presence of
[1:11:44] the Lord Jesus Christ because he
[1:11:45] promised to be here and they're
[1:11:47] recognizing his presence and another
[1:11:49] city will sit dry and one will have his
[1:11:52] crops they'll be
[1:11:53] growing and growing and growing and
[1:11:54] another will be halted and withering and
[1:11:57] drying and then after the service the
[1:12:00] one brother will go and talk to the
[1:12:02] other brother out in the foyer a man
[1:12:04] began to draw from from from the revival
[1:12:07] going on the inside and what the one the
[1:12:10] brother had the rain will be rejoicing
[1:12:13] in the presence of the Lord amen amen
[1:12:15] and as you talked to the brother
[1:12:17] there's rejoicing and you yourself have
[1:12:20] no rejoice scene in your heart and you
[1:12:22] walk out the doors to the parking lot
[1:12:24] and you will not be satisfied because
[1:12:27] the rain will fall upon one and not upon
[1:12:30] the other amen but reality the rain is
[1:12:32] here and it'll fall upon whosoever will
[1:12:35] let him come unto me amen who saw he
[1:12:40] said and yet ye have not returned unto
[1:12:43] me I mean it's not that they didn't
[1:12:46] desire the rain the diet that a desire
[1:12:49] for the rain was there amen eat look
[1:12:52] they are running after the right in it
[1:12:54] it's not that the desire for the Holy
[1:12:55] Ghost he asked ever in the room would
[1:12:57] you like to be revived in the power of
[1:12:59] the Almighty Holy Ghost would you like
[1:13:01] to be revived by the spirit of the
[1:13:03] Living God and also say yes and amen
[1:13:05] it's not just the desire that's there
[1:13:08] amen but you have not turned unto me
[1:13:11] you've not returned unto me amen so it's
[1:13:15] not just that that you want the rain or
[1:13:17] I wish the rain of coffee but it's
[1:13:19] actually submitting and surrender
[1:13:21] yourself unto the Lord that's how you
[1:13:23] get the rain and you say that's how you
[1:13:26] get the rain you say it's not just the
[1:13:28] wishing so it's not just I hope the rain
[1:13:31] will come to me I'd like to have some of
[1:13:33] that Holy Ghost every once in a while
[1:13:34] I'd like to have that Holy Ghost to my
[1:13:36] life you know the Holy Ghost you know we
[1:13:37] we call it that like we say this like a
[1:13:40] duh and we say this you know though
[1:13:43] that's like oil and we give all these
[1:13:44] things it's like this it's like that but
[1:13:46] for all that it's not a duck it's not
[1:13:49] oil the Holy Spirit is God Himself amen
[1:13:53] it's not some inanimate object out there
[1:13:55] or some something a little bit of energy
[1:13:57] you can get or some electricity in your
[1:14:00] life or something like that
[1:14:01] no this Holy Ghost is is God
[1:14:04] amen he is the sin he is the same
[1:14:06] yesterday today and forever Amen you
[1:14:09] know the questions and answers they ask
[1:14:11] for the brand once
[1:14:12] what is this pillar of fire that follows
[1:14:14] you around and brother Ram says it's God
[1:14:19] amen Ennis he says it's the pillar of
[1:14:22] fire that follow the children of Israel
[1:14:24] in the wilderness amen he says and he's
[1:14:27] the same and he says it's not just for
[1:14:30] me but for every true believer a man
[1:14:34] that will seek after him amen it's not
[1:14:36] just maybe those that maybe you may
[1:14:39] never actually see it with your own
[1:14:40] natural eyes but by the virtue of the
[1:14:43] scriptures you know that it'll be there
[1:14:46] amen because he's the same yesterday
[1:14:47] today and forever and he's made a divine
[1:14:51] appointment
[1:14:53] amen amen so two or three cities
[1:14:57] wandered on to one city to drink water
[1:14:59] but they were not satisfied yet ye have
[1:15:03] not returned unto me Amen so though they
[1:15:07] had a desire for the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:09] because they would not return unto the
[1:15:11] Lord to seek his face amen but when you
[1:15:14] seek his face there's a promise for that
[1:15:16] or there's not a promise for just
[1:15:19] wishing and hoping amen amen
[1:15:23] of chapter five Amos chapter five verse
[1:15:26] 4 it says for thus saith the Lord unto
[1:15:30] the house of Israel seek ye me and ye
[1:15:34] shall live but seek not Bethel nor enter
[1:15:38] into Gilgal past not to Beersheba for
[1:15:42] gil gosh is surely going to captivity
[1:15:43] and Bethel shall come to nought now
[1:15:46] weren't one of those cities those are
[1:15:47] cities have had revivals a mint a mint
[1:15:53] Gilgal was where they were circumcised
[1:15:55] and when they came into the Promised
[1:15:57] Land the city of the hill the foreskins
[1:16:00] they scald it Amen the Bethel is the
[1:16:03] house of God's bread where God's bread
[1:16:05] would come down he meant they meant that
[1:16:08] don't just seek those but seek him right
[1:16:11] now right here right where you're at
[1:16:12] seek don't seek him underneath some
[1:16:15] other tradition of something going on in
[1:16:17] the past but seek
[1:16:18] right now where he's at he meant seek
[1:16:21] the Lord and he shall live lest he break
[1:16:23] out like fire in the house of Joseph and
[1:16:25] devour and there be none to quench in
[1:16:27] Bethel amen
[1:16:28] seek him right now and you shall live
[1:16:32] amen amen
[1:16:36] every man is going to have his chance as
[1:16:38] opportunity in divine presence like the
[1:16:41] brother preaching a Wednesday about it
[1:16:44] was preaching about the Nestor there all
[1:16:49] everyone had their chance before the
[1:16:51] king everybody had their chance how they
[1:16:54] would present themselves Amen everybody
[1:16:56] you you have a chance to show up before
[1:16:59] the Lord Jesus Christ however you want
[1:17:00] to you and every church has the same
[1:17:03] thing they can present themselves on the
[1:17:05] Lord however they want to do it whatever
[1:17:07] they want to be when the Lord comes into
[1:17:09] the room into their service they have
[1:17:11] that opportunity amen we had the
[1:17:14] opportunity this morning how do we want
[1:17:16] to enter in newest presence we can enter
[1:17:19] into his presence with Thanksgiving we
[1:17:21] can turn to his prep course with joy
[1:17:23] amen work and your endear with I hope
[1:17:26] this doesn't last long today I hope this
[1:17:28] gets over done I hope it doesn't preach
[1:17:29] too long I hope that doesn't I wonder
[1:17:32] what I can do this afternoon for lunch I
[1:17:35] wonder what we can do afterwards so
[1:17:36] every one of us had an opportunity this
[1:17:38] morning of how we wanted to look what we
[1:17:41] wanted to have on our minds what we
[1:17:43] wanted to be like when we entered into
[1:17:44] the room when we went into divine
[1:17:46] presence because we had a divine
[1:17:48] appointment to meet him this morning
[1:17:50] Amen a divine appointment and we all had
[1:17:53] our opportunity how would we meet him
[1:17:57] amen amen amen
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:04] here on the book of Haggai you remember
[1:18:09] that they were given the promise they
[1:18:13] say go back leave Babylon behind go back
[1:18:18] to Jerusalem rebuild the temple of
[1:18:20] praise I will take pleasure in it and I
[1:18:23] will meet you there
[1:18:25] amen and they were given everything they
[1:18:27] had need of to build the temple amen and
[1:18:30] when they got there they started
[1:18:32] building their own houses and after 16
[1:18:36] years asked God sent a prophet to go
[1:18:39] knock on their door he said it's been
[1:18:46] now 16 years since you were sent here to
[1:18:50] build the house of God and you went and
[1:18:54] you built your own houses and I see your
[1:18:56] houses are all decked out trimmed out
[1:18:58] finished have everything you could ever
[1:19:00] want in a house and yet the house the
[1:19:03] parts for the house of the Lord God are
[1:19:05] laying there in ruins
[1:19:08] and he says go down and get you trees
[1:19:11] and build this house and I will take
[1:19:13] glory in it amen every one of us has
[1:19:17] been as a chance to build our house amen
[1:19:20] just like the foolish virgins they all
[1:19:22] had a chance everyone go down and get
[1:19:25] you Isle you're going to take part of
[1:19:27] this wedding and you have one thing to
[1:19:29] do in this wedding and that has to shine
[1:19:31] light from here all the way to the door
[1:19:33] amen that's the one job that they had to
[1:19:36] do at the wedding was there to have
[1:19:38] lamps and there to take their light and
[1:19:40] there to shine light from where they're
[1:19:42] at to all the way to the door where ever
[1:19:44] they heard the voice coming but when
[1:19:46] they heard his voice there to follow
[1:19:48] that voice and go all the way to the
[1:19:49] door shiny light all the way a man bow
[1:19:53] and the voice cried out amen many of
[1:19:56] them couldn't get their lamps to work
[1:19:57] anymore in Psalms says thy word Oh Lord
[1:19:59] is a lamp unto my feet and a light under
[1:20:01] my path a man and they couldn't get the
[1:20:03] gospel to work for him anymore I mean
[1:20:05] they couldn't point out any of the
[1:20:07] scriptures they were alive in their life
[1:20:08] a man there was no flame on this thing
[1:20:11] it wasn't living in their life there
[1:20:13] there was nothing about this that was
[1:20:15] alive in their life a man so when the
[1:20:17] voice came out and the cried go ye out
[1:20:19] to meet him some had this living in
[1:20:21] their life and some did not have this
[1:20:23] living in their life and those that were
[1:20:25] living we're able to shine light all the
[1:20:27] way because not only did they have the
[1:20:29] word but they had the anointing of the
[1:20:31] Holy Ghost that comes upon the word it
[1:20:34] makes it manifest in their life and
[1:20:36] those are the ones that went in after a
[1:20:38] man but those that had this sitting on a
[1:20:41] bookshelf in their life and they
[1:20:42] couldn't come and give the testimony of
[1:20:45] when the holy
[1:20:46] was anointing the scripture in their
[1:20:47] life to bring the testimonies is
[1:20:49] something that God is doing in their
[1:20:50] life
[1:20:51] hey man those did not go in the rapture
[1:20:53] because they had no testimony of the
[1:20:55] Holy Spirit anointing the word in their
[1:20:58] life
[1:20:59] amen amen God and God sent all of us
[1:21:03] here to get oil in our lamps to gate to
[1:21:07] keep our wicks clean clean and clean
[1:21:09] Trent Amen so we could shine light all
[1:21:12] the way to the wedding and that light is
[1:21:14] the light of the gospel and it's the
[1:21:16] light of the acts of the Holy Spirit in
[1:21:18] the church amen and if we're not shining
[1:21:21] that light then how can we say that we
[1:21:23] are we are looking forward to a divine
[1:21:25] appointment of a rapture a man because
[1:21:28] there's more than just the divine
[1:21:30] appointment of a church service that's
[1:21:32] just one measure of appointment there
[1:21:34] are other appointments that God has made
[1:21:36] with us amen let's just turn over to
[1:21:38] first Corinthians 15:52 amen he he said
[1:21:47] where two or three are gathered right
[1:21:49] there I'll be there in the midst of them
