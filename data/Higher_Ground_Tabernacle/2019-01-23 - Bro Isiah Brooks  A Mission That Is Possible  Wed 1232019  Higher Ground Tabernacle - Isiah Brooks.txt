second Corinthians 6:17 and eighteenth verse wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be sons and daughters saith the Lord all mighty let us pray father God we come before you lord as humbly as we know how Jesus please have mercy upon our souls we cry out Lord Jesus for our theophany Lord we cry out for our glorified body we cry out for the promises that you have made us and we believe with all of our heart that your promises are a blessed a service here tonight in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated just to give a little note of background I like to first entitle this message a mission that is possible a mission that is possible and if I had a theme it would be faith is positive one thing I know about God the Bible says that without faith is impossible to please in faith in itself is a revelation given by God you can't pump yourself up to it you can't psychologically enter into it faith in itself is a birth it's something that is born given to you by a power that we call God when God calls men God gives them faith to believe think about all of the things that Abraham had to contend with perhaps Abraham didn't even know what faith was but when he heard the voice of God and however God talked with him automatically abraham believed understand that belief came from God that's why the Bible said if a man believed that they're there in God or there there's one God say he do it well because even God gives that revelation think about the thing when it comes to Abraham how he was adding a land of child deer where there was nothing but idol-worshipping he had no doubt seen perhaps thousands of God's and everybody claiming that their God was God but it's amazing how God can contact an individual and for some reason they have no proof he's God but they know he is that's how it was with Abraham because when it comes to faith faith it's like possessing of an actual force it's it's it's a being it's something that has an existence even though you can't touch it it exists for an example the Bible said the whole world was created by faith by faith it is a force it is existence in existence and you know the Prophet God said that faith in itself is God now I'm not talking about an intellectual faith I'm talking about a God faith a faith that could only be implanted into you by God when it comes to they think about it it is a force it is something that compels you like it did you know Abraham that called those things that be not as though they were faith is such a powerful force it literally gives you a vision of the reality or the thing that you want from God it becomes so real it's real more real than this natural world because you can't explain it yet you know it exists you know I think about Christopher Columbus how he believed and he don't even know why he believed but you got to understand that God anointed him to believe in something that no one else could see or envision and he knew that there was another land somewhere a man and he traveled by faith didn't have one ounce of proof and because he so believed it God allowed him to come into that land that he believed existed even though he had never seen it before see we believe in something that we've never seen before we know that there is a heaven we know that there's our God we know that there is a throne somewhere and we know by faith huh it's more than words on the page people because faith becomes your life you become it and it becomes you think about it now one thing about this Bible the Bible says faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God now it would make you think that you had had to have this written Bible before you can have faith but God is his word and when any man whether you ever be whether you able to read or not faith comes by hearing hearing by the word who is Jesus who is Christ and when Christ speaks you have to obey he said oh come on brother books let me say it like this brother Adam said that when God dealt with Isaac or Eliezer he also dealt with Rebekah he worked on both ends and Eleazar was going to find Isaac away so how did Rebecca know to water the camel and the man it was revealed to her by faith she heard from God hallelujah come on somebody the woman with the issue of blood it wasn't written it wasn't in the scripture but something said to her if you but touch to him and she believed it faith entered into her and she touched the humans calling she was on a mission and it was a faith mission a mission given to her by faith Abraham was on a mission a mission that was given to him by faith because Abraham had never met God before until after he believed and after he started into his journey it was then after the battle he met McKenna Dec he met a man he met a God in the form of a man hallelujah and because he believed when there was nothing to prove it that he existed he now came in contact with the thing that existed hallelujah and when he came in contact amen with the God that was one time invisible he fell down and made him ties and honored him hallelujah sheep that's the kind of a thing think does faith puts you in a mission because you got to understand that the Word of God is on a mission once it left God's mouth once it was spoken the Bible said it goes out and it doesn't return void it goes out and it accomplished everything that was spoken it gathers it up and brings it back to God see that's what faith does amen it is only reason why we're serving God because when he spoke us our names in the book it went out and it's been thousands of years more than we can imagine years how come on before Adam was created as a man on the earth God had already spoken is that right God had already in his mind created everything and he spoke that word and without thousands of years yet now since then and it's still moving it's still gathering it's still collecting because the word is on a mission and it cannot come back boy so that you can understand what I'm trying to say Isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive for hundred years I believe a more he meant it God through the mouth of a man spoke that word hallelujah and for hundreds of years it traveled hallelujah generations out the generations it traveled until that virgin what thousands of virgins were born maybe millions of virgins had come and gone but there was only one version that that word saw that fit the description of what it was sent out together hallelujah Hema and then that same fate that same world came along and grabbed Mary hey the thing I love about God is because God already knows your response when she hear the voice hallelujah and even though Mary couldn't scientifically explain because faith cannot be explained could not explain I mean how this thing was going to happen to her seeing that she knew no man she yet said be it unto me according to that word when faith struck that version Isaiah no matter where he was I believe he was shouting praising God amen I told you a virgin shall conceive you think about it now I'm coming down to something here because God has called us to be a bride and right now we are in the midst of Laodicea and God chose you to be here in this wicked age but God requires one thing from us and that's faith you've got to believe this if you don't believe it see you can't scientifically it ain't there for you to break it down and process it no more than it was for Mary she couldn't understand what and how God was going to do it but one thing the angel said unto Mary Mary this thing in you is out the Holy Ghost and it will bring it to pass see it's God in you bringing his word to pass you can't figure it out but he don't want negative thoughts from you he don't want or I don't know how I'm gonna make it he just does not wolf oh my I'm you know I didn't know a lot of things and sometimes I don't know and sometimes we speak things that we shouldn't speak I'm a reader caught in just a moment but God don't need you to say I'm a weak God don't need us to say you know any negative thing out of our mouth regardless to what it appears to be Abraham you mean to tell me you're gonna have a son you better believe it how come God said so I'm on a mission to prove that God's Word is truth hallelujah I know the mission you know the mission that God's Word is true and it cannot come back for it I don't care what it looks like if God can take a horse a hold on that was rored without shake hallelujah top is covered a deep hallelujah if God can said let there be light and light came to this planet like and come to this planet life can come to you God is powerful more powerful he can separate the darkness from the light hallelujah by the word of God he separates the darkness from the light in you by way of preaching hallelujah wherefore come out from among them he said God I can't do it God said you can hallelujah let go and let God have his way I was talking to a brother today you know the trouble with us we don't want to suffer we don't like it nobody likes suffering I don't like suffering but I think God forward because I know through this suffering I am being made perfect it is through his chest eyes meant that I know that I am a son I want him to correct me I may not like it but I know he's my father and I know my father will do exactly what is best for me y'all understand me how many y'all enjoy a whipping now thank your mama thank you daddy I appreciate it oh the pain covers all the appreciation it's after the beating you realize that he did it for you good and that is after you mature and understand why daddy spanked you oh my god that's how he is hey he's a better father than my natural father could have ever been is this okay see we must understand by God's grace we are on a mission and this mission is possible and I want to say it's a power how can I say it if the Word of God says that you and I are more than conquerors we're more than conquerors I don't care if you fail seven times in the day fall seven times in a day the Bible says a just man when he falls if he falls seven times in a day he gets up she is not even in our DNA to stay down you can't cry because faith the word says are you going to get up anything about you and me is about him it's about defeating Satan in his own Edom and you and I could have never done it the man is a mastermind God then garden is not babbling some chump hallelujah he fixed the the right thing peasant as an enemy but he wanted to show his enemy that he's still God God fights you know in a fair way you know God could have dispelled Lucifer even in the beginning before time he could have got rid of him but that was his opportunity so God did what he formed the creation and put himself in their creation and whoop the devil you hear what I'm saying and if God came into Jesus and defeated the even in hell he can defeat the devil in laodicea huh you are God weapon trained you and I've meet you and me we are gods amen we are the Angels that stood in that day and as we stood in that day we will and will and will stand in this day there is no defeating us say to know it and you need to you and I need to say okay I cannot be defeated hallelujah because Christ lives in me is that right oh he thought see God has shown us so many time Shadrach Meshach and Abednego right when the when it looks like God was being defeated what happens he steps into the furnace is that right when Daniels looked like he was being defeated it looked like the devil was defeated what happened God steps in the picture so you gotta understand when the devil look like he's defeating you don't you worry is in the book God will always step in the picture he sets you up hello he set you up god yes he does he wants you to see how mighty of a warrior he is and he was your enemy to see how mighty of a warrior he is he said I got bad habits brother Bruce I've had him for a long time God before you knew him allowed those bad habits to be implanted in you oh god I didn't matter that no better I would have never chosen that it wasn't your choice in the beginning God allowed it to be if you have been a drunk of God saw you as a drunk if you have been a crackhead God saw you as a crackhead whatever you are but guess what before all of that he put his seed in you and me before the foundation of the world because he knew that God seed could defeat any darkness oh yeah oh oh a true seed of God can never be held down can never be stopped hallelujah is that all right in mark 9:23 jesus says unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believe it not just believe what continue to believe Oh Lord God I can't Holly wait to the storm over don't worry about how long the stormy you just have faith in God faith don't need proof our faith do not need proof if God said with the stripes you heal I am healed I don't need proof I don't need sighs but these signs will follow them they believe if you could just grab it and says it's mine it never quit you know it's a force this is the thing that will make everything come into your play will make everything humble yourself humble itself to you yeah at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of who the Father and what is your name you bear the same name of your husband so everything as long as you in Christ everything I don't care what it looks like everything if you hold the faith to believe that is working towards your good it has to come down and bow itself to you it's really bowing itself to the name of Jesus Christ but he gave you that name heaven and earth bears that name we have no other Authority we have no other authority other than the name of Jesus Christ we don't come in our name we go in his name God cuz every principality must bow itself to that name Christ is the mystery he said but the thing of it is you're not saved about your organization by your denomination you're saved by your own personal faith in Jesus Christ that's all so it's between you and Christ alone you so you seek out the scripture and believe him with all your heart and he'll save you or heal you and if he doesn't keep his word than he isn't God and if he does keep his word it proves he's God so we believe him with all of our hearts hallelujah it ain't no ifs in it hallelujah oh I'm coming in just a minute I'm not gonna be long but listen think about it how difficult it would be if we had to save ourselves first of all we could never do it fallen man could never do it that's why God had to create a man who could do it hallelujah there was no angel holy enough to do it there was no Seraphim holy enough to do it the Holies of Holies had to come down to do it and that was God himself he was the only one that can literally free mankind hallelujah so let me put it this way he is the only one that could save you and he's the only one that can condemn you no one else can condemn you Paul says who just separate us from the love of God hmm even the Word of God says what weapon formed against you shall prosper see there is nobody that could stand against you in the judgement if God has justified you if God has called your holy no man there is no evidence and then that any man not even Lucifer his blood alone I love this oh I got so much in that blood I'm not even finished preaching at you I see things about that more so than I ever have in my entire save life but the man says dear God we are grateful to you tonight for the privilege of knowing Jesus Christ our Savior your son in the free pardoning of our sins and to know that his blood is sufficient that covers all of our sins and our iniquities they're so blotted out and put in the sea of forgiveness and his bride was staying at a wedding supper pure of the unadulterated to marry the son of God how we thank thee for this all sufficiency and the faith to know that we do not trust in our own merits but in his merits alone for what he did for us we are so grateful see you la if you trust in any merit of your own you still lost remember the parable lord have we not cast out devils in your name have we not been this debt in the other that was the problem because once you know Jesus you know it's no longer I he is a one that's doing it all so when you go before him with I he says no no no no we never knew you I never knew you you're not the eye on the eye right if you really know God you must come to understand everything we do it is by the power of the Holy Spirit and all glory goes to God hallelujah is that all right folks now coming in just a minute because you really love God you do everything you possibly can do to live according to his standard hallelujah hello everything and you must understand only God can do it if you live by your own methods if you live by your own practices hallelujah you see what I'm saying you delivered Oh God I overcame cigarettes did you really do it or did he do it for you see when God takes it from you then it is God who gets the glory but when it becomes human effort that's all it is Oh hallelujah yeah maybe I'm wrong but I have come to realize that there have been many times I overcame things by human effort and down the road I fell back into it because it was human effort but when God takes it he takes the wheel he takes the desire he takes every piece of that darkness and cast it out hallelujah is that right that's my James James talk about it when you're double minded that means you still got darkness in you a real Sun and throne of God when that Bible when that world comes into you and then they clean up the house like brother Branham said he said that cosmic light is pushed out and that eternal light takes over that's what we want we want God to separate the darkness from the light just like he did in it and even he took the that he's separated who did it that voice that's why people they don't come to church and they find themselves stealing darkness because it's by the preaching of the word that God speaks and then that word bring conviction and then God comes alone when the person is ready to repent though and he takes away the darkness and brings in the light is that right because Jesus said I don't have no darkness in me boom so we must become like him we must get to the place where there is no darkness you know I was telling somebody that what brother Brooks brother you can't even do what I'm talking about none of us has the ability to do it can any man add a static cubit to a statue the Bible says no you know how you get that done on your knees pray mmm and understand because you pray that don't save you you say by the grace of God but when you pray hallelujah right when you pray God hears the heart he knows how to the Bundys of the heart the mouth speaketh hallelujah and you cry out before God because you don't want to be like this because you know you have fallen creature and you're just trying to get back home hallelujah whoo I want that hole in this I wants new Lord I don't remember it but I want that hole in this I once had hallelujah Oh glory to God whoo Jesus help us Lord Mark 1436 says and I'm trying to put something in you tonight so that you know that all things are possible all things are possible to them that believe but you must believe you must believe your bride even if there is no proof that you are hey somebody should've shouted even if you don't bill yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is a desperate had no idea she was gonna be queen but she was elected and chosen and guess what the word pushed her in position huh the word will push you in position it will bring you to the place that God saw you in a you is God he said God won't do that yes he will and it always never always easy Jesus had be born in Bethlehem God raised the taxes and told everybody you got to go back to your old Providence hallelujah and God could care less I won't put it that way left put it this way God saw that Mary was pregnant he could have took Mary on that journey a few months earlier but he took on that journey because he knew by the time she got there it would be on the right date of the right month that lambs are born and God in his mind said it so they had no idea what God was doing God didn't tell Mary when Jesus was gonna be born the only thing he told her is that when he is born his name would be Jesus hallelujah let me tell you something God I put you on a rough road before you get a real birth of the Holy Ghost hallelujah but at the end of the day you'll be so glad whoo God is gonna take you there because the Bible says so now I'm telling you I could never be curse can you ever because know the Bible according the book of Revelation said blessed is the man who hear it the which the sayings of this book we read at the site y'all I'm blessed and who God is best know making course ever Cain curse you I don't care what sickness that devil cannot cost you and if there is a sickness you must realize God is allowing it but do you want to hear you say thank you praise God in every situation thank you Jesus oh the devil say you've done evil that's why oh but thank you Jesus if I'm being chastised thank you Jesus if it's just a prank character thank you Jesus because Lord you the master of it all and I know I'm on a mission now that okay this is a funny thing my daughter had some medication and I don't know why she had it in mind Am I my bathroom my cabinet and her peel looked just like mine and I didn't even think to read it because all the medicine was in my bathroom and I wasn't certain white whether I took her medicine or not but I did take some of mine the heart for high blood pressure and I got in in their kitchen and started eating something and all of a sudden I got so sick whoo I ran to the bathroom in whatever was supposed to be there came up you understand what I'm saying God could have really let allowed this thing to affect me in a sense because it was serious stuff could allow that thing to affect me but you know what God did he told my body that ain't here that's not he it's him not really and my wife brought it to my attention say thank the Lord for bringing whatever that was you see in all things give things that's what God is looking for everything must remain positive y'all hear me somebody steal my car thank you Jesus hallelujah so whatever comes it must be positive because you can see the devil wants you to complain that's what got the children Israel in wilderness murmuring and complaining you get the devil in this time God don't look for he don't want a nagging and complaining why he will somebody that's submissive hallelujah and that's what God is required have you been guilty yes but the word comes to correct the word comes to set us free and all I could ask God to do is keep me along you were the keeper of the soul it's just okay hallelujah listen God requires us to receive car requires us to give up everything you cannot allow one little thing of this world to remain everything must go and many of us don't even know how to get rid of it don't worry Abraham was the same way he didn't know how to get rid of lot then god forced the issue Clark all the deters disturbance churches had a fall out but it was God's doing because the Bible said act like Abraham got rid of lot that's when the promise was made clear see as long as we hanging on to lot car came make it clear to you gotta separate is that right separate yourself from all the things of the world now when Jesus heard these things Luke 18 22 through 30 he said to them yet like it's now one thing sell all that thou had and distribute it unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich one of the things I want you to understand is is that when the word of God comes to you and you feel sorrowful that is not a good thing to have because when you feeling sorrowful more than like you're not going to give it up my TV do you realize how much it cost it's the truth they get sorrowful cuz they can't give it up the devil gives you every reason why not to give it up I'm just using that as a scenario folks but my point is it could be anything if I get rid of it I'm gonna be bored where Jesus where is Jesus that's what that brother said you know I know I'm supposed to pray brother but I I just don't have nothing making me pray why should anything make you pray there should not be anything to make you pray you shouldn't have to be made to pray I totally say you know how God showed me about prayer I said listen you have a best friend you never get tired of talking with them you talk hours on the phone you'll call him he'll call you right I said is is talking to car if you knew him as a friend you could talk to him but a lot of people don't know him as a friend and think about the times we spend yanking our yakking and yakking with each other amen and then you very you hardly ever give God fellowship in conversation and that's what what Kaveri was all about Calvary restored fellowship sonship always remained fellowship is what God wanted and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is all about that's what the Holy Ghost is all about fellowship and what we call communion communion is not here on the sunny yeah that's just symbolic but communion is supposed to be every day all day but you know what communion means one the bottom line of communion is one one bread one wine one body one spirit one church I don't care how you slice it it's still what mmm is that right what was the vision now you understand now the prayer of Jesus Christ cannot come back boy he said father I would they be one even as we are one hello is that right so let me say like this Jesus at Lazarus tomb says father I know that thou always here is my prayer huh he said Lord the only thing I ever requests of you in all of this victory is that they be with me wherever I am somebody help me just like you may have heard me say there's a difference between being in the kingdom of God is that right and the kingdom of heaven everybody who claim to be Christians are in the kingdom of heaven but there's only a selected group that's in the kingdom of God and everyone that's in the kingdom of God will be in the New Jerusalem but people who are in the kingdom of heaven there will be servants they'll be out of the city though they be saved feel like shouting John denied so you and I must realize by the grace of God this mission this purpose it cannot come back void if nobody believes you Brian you gotta believe it what evidence you have oh my god is that something is telling me that I am faith is what I have I'm gonna believe that just like I told her brother the other day I said the only person they could ever tell me and show me I'm not right is Jesus Christ himself nobody else trials come in they're coming first pressure is coming and it's coming persecution is coming and it's coming and when it does will anybody anything be able to separate you from the love of God absolutely not hallelujah amen Peter was so excited about leaving this land he said crucify me upside down is that right I don't think about this force this faith amen that force Paul RuPaul amen to say listen don't don't kill me now don't even set me free he told me that I had to go before the Emperor hmm I know Nero's waiting and I'm waiting on Nero you see it is a force it is a power it is God in you that makes you believe everything this book says do I understand at all absolutely not when the Bible said that the whole Holy Spirit picked up Ezekiel by the hairs of his head and carried into him into the heavens I don't understand that but I believe that's exactly what happened whoa you say well what do you mean what I'm trying to tell you now the power of God will make you live right it's going to force the issue it's not going to allow you to allow sin to continue in sin cannot reign in this mortal body the Holy Spirit is to reign in this body y'all hear me and if God is in you he's gonna force the issue when everybody else is gonna have peace he's not gonna allow you to have it till you deal with it it's just okay but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that comes to God must believe that he is God is any ideas or reward of them that did you seek Him now I think about this Hebrew boys brother met him said they prayed all night and then they have a breakthrough go I gotta have a breakthrough no God put you there God every battle that ever came against you God was in the midst of it he did it and he know that the challenge was would be great but he knew also that you would come out as a victory the victory he knew that was in you come on somebody now think about it God didn't say who you know I wonder will job really you know I don't know whether Joel would know God knew the outcome God knew that Joel was a man that he that could stand the test why would he say this man loves me ha and realize that love is the greatest force Allah because God is love Oh Lord I'm trying to love this brother you need a baptism of love you need to love the God that he is love to in Tony and that's what John said John said we don't need to teach you how to love God is love hallelujah what do you think we're fighting for with Tom on taking the land all of the hint I stammered eyes the Debbie's eyes all of the way in the land and we're fighting amen to cross over into divine law it's a battle it ain't just freely given to you but the Word of God said wherever you set your feet hey you can possess the land you and I are possessors of the land and don't you know if you stay in the will of God you will have total victory victory after victory it was when a can see it Israel began to lose the battle but as long as the a came is not there as long as a piece of the world is gone nothing is hindering you you win every battle no matter how long it take and if you being the same having the same God in you that Joshua has all you got to do is say son stand still I'm gonna whip this battle the devil is not gonna get victory over me I'm gonna win this battle keep the light coming law keep the revelation flooring on keep the power flowing hallelujah until I whipped the devil and make my enemy my footstool whoo God a brother shared this scripture with me today let's go to Colossians 3 please without faith it's impossible to please him for he that come to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him are you seeking Him are you seeking him that's him the divine nature is God did you understood I was telling us there you know when I was in Arizona I didn't preach but I was just sharing don't you understand the divine nature of that we talked about Paul says entering into the divine nature jesus said I am the vine you are the branches that the nature that flows through that is that as long as you connect it it's going to flow through you it's going to flow through you you will produce fruit it ain't him or not you will as long as the life of God is flowing through you you will produce the fruits of the spirit it has to happen that's the law whoo y'all don't understand but I feel like shouting see because I realize Amen that even in my shortcomings when I fail you know God just don't allow me oh my god I'm gonna hell don't even come to my my you know what comes to my mind repentance God please give me a true spirit of repentance give me a true spirit of repentance don't let me continue repeating this over and over and over again no no no no no give me a to fear to repentance so that inter please you and you can get rid of this you can come down and let that light shine and get all of this nasty stuff out of me I'm not the only one that deals with it you can trust it if you wanna he'll show up and show out he will that's what flesh is for he's the devil that's that serpent part of you you didn't know that that's that serpent part of you and people say it didn't happen it did I'm living proof of it so are you you say what do you mean why because your greatest battle in this flesh is sexual because that's how I started so it in anyway Colossians 3 you know you don't have people don't have technology because I know it's true only really you can be a monk and you go have battles up there even when there's not a woman in sight oh yeah you said even the prophet of God had battles he put a cross in front of his car because he had battles that certain part was being you know but God getting rid of the serpent brothers sisters and then there is no sister Piper God is getting rid of the bird he's getting rid of the serpent giving us a real body we won't have to worry about him again I'm so happy about it if he then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above hmm where God sitteth on the right hand of God what think about that scripture seek those things that are above where God so let's go to heaven for just a moment the Bible says no unclean thing nothing that makes a lie nothing Amen that they will defiled that's what's up there all that's there is the virtues of God clean and holy and righteous and pure and all of these things I thought about said think on these things whatsoever is good whatsoever thing is lovely what everything is pure these are the things we're supposed to think on why because that those kind of thoughts puts us in heavenly places is that right set your affection on things above and not on the earth but if you've never been above what is it that you're going to set your affection on my affection God give me temperance your temperance patience your patience see those are the things that are above Lord most of all Lord I want to be crowned with your divine love listen this marriage will not be Mitch mix-matched bone of his bone flesh of his flesh whatever he is the Bible said whatever he is in heaven we are it on is that the way the mom said that we're here on earth so we got to understand that now this is not him this fresh is not him but the enemy the enemy the one who's been born again that's him and this child that's born in use of the Holy Ghost but understand it wants to grow into a mature man and I was going to go if you're not reading or praying and studying brother branham said the Holy Ghost feeds off the word fees he you feeding the Holy Ghost you use somebody for your dad in your life is hid we're with Christ in God old now the devil man with you he just told you just told you something your life is here and see the devil be attacking this flesh thing and he's attacking you but this flesh is dead yes right brother is that right it is dead it's condemned it's dead the real you is on the inside and that part of you was hid well in Christ and who is Christ God in spirit that's the blood that's the token that's the life and my life is here so you said what do you mean brother Brooks really you must understand that the only life that really counts with God is Jesus Christ as himself that's why you in him hidden that's the only way you can be accepted is to be in him we are accepted we're in the beloved so god don't see you if you're in Christ that's all he sees is Christ that's why you can be so justified as though you've never seen in the first place now I'm taking it to this level but you got to understand there's a true man of God or a sister of God amen if you're a true one your ambition is to please him every day to live as holy as your pop why because the Holy Ghost wants you to live that way anything dirt you confess you may cry why because you inside your true nature right is holy hmm he's like plunging a dove into mud oh but God protects us folks don't you realize if there was not a blood veil around the earth even your prophet would have died he wouldn't have made Kyle even him he thought he was all right you know naturally right there's a time he thought he was a god he didn't need a guy you gotta say yes you are yes you do I'm gonna show you your prophet and I'm allowing you to get lost so that you know that you need a guide without me you're nothing oh you gonna judge somebody come on behind the door and we'll show you what you need to stay humble why you need to show yourself in a place of humility hallelujah you and I in a place to judge nothing hallelujah come on behind the door she looked pretty bad to you right but you what you don't know is that she's mine they're all brother branham don't call them Rickey's and we care as their mind it appeared they look like children around but only inside I got representation there that lady got on the floor with her purple hair purple live and he said I let her back to Christ right into that right in that restaurant she you came you know I I used to have a bad problem with all these tattoo things but you don't know you don't know these people are crying out for something and you shining them wrong spirit wrong spirit you're sitting in the seat of the scarf Oh hallelujah how the thought is Lord how can I touch that man how can I reach that woman I don't care what they look like it could be a sign and a daughter of God or eagle behind bars hallelujah we got to do we got to think like Christ hallelujah when that woman came and start washing his feet he could care less and that's the problem we care too much about what people think we should care less about what they think when God said go you go when God said do you do right he's the one speaking and you didn't come into this world without a mission every one of us have a mission and our mission is to gather our brothers and sisters bring them back to Christ hallelujah help us Lord aha so many of us going to be ashamed because you know how many souls of you would a brother called me the other day he said brother Brooks I'm so distressed he said I want to win souls to the Lord I'll be talking to people and I don't know I said brother I want you to understand we are in a time of gleaning this is not harvest as supposed to you know you're gonna get a big crop coming out I said the big crop has already been reached right I said now we're in harvest I said you keep looking God has laid them out there is that right just like he did for Ruth they're out there pick up your corn they're there for you just don't give up you don't quit you don't stop praying you don't stop asking God to lead you right it gets discouraging sometimes hallelujah but you got to keep on moving you want a job don't be afraid to speak truth then sometime the devil well you know let me tell you what let me say like this sometimes and I it's the truth we'll find ourselves having more mercy and grace than God huh we want to have more pity we want to repent you can't say nobody ooh but what happens when a man or a woman died and you didn't tell them the truth don't tell me I've experienced it I almost told them the truth but I was so afraid they might not like it or may not like me and I still have that on my heart and my conscience because they died without knowing the truth and I had the truth horrible experience that will never leave you fellow so you don't know one lady in particular who's a friend of my sister a man I had the opportunity of sharing it with her oh she was a Christian she loved the way I preach but I never went no further with it Amen I saw her almost like the night before she died sitting up all of day with her husband and she drops dead Agnes was her name and all I could do was say God have mercy upon my soul please Lord don't let her miss heaven for me because of me my failure brother Pelham said even when he went into the dinners office he told him about Jesus and I tried my best to tell people about Jesus now when they shut me off they shut me off it ain't my fault now but I'm gonna tell him I want the doctor to know I'm a Christian cuz I know he gonna think I'm crazy some of them do because doctors are no longer Christians the way they used to be but anyway let me move on is that right this is it modified there for them your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked some time when you lived in them but now ye also put off all these anger what wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds thought this was good and have put on what the new man which is renewed hello renew in the knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian Scythian bond nor free but Christ is in all and in all we listen the real Holy Ghost has no problems changing you or me or you and I whichever way is right the point is God can do exceedingly abundantly above whatsoever we ask or think but like I said you got to believe it and one of the things that Satan always get us with is unbelief and it's true y'all know it works and I remember sometimes we could have greater faith for others that we can have for ourselves why is that oh I know God's gonna heal her I know God's gonna heal him but when it comes to us you know with the deficit say you ain't worthy for it and you just did this and that get up out of here you got to remember that the Bible says it all let's put away the message of this hour said we have been justified as though we've never done it in the first place so in the eyes of God I am in a place to receive whatever God says is for me it's given to you it is given you don't work for it it's given don't listen to the message law is I think it's 1955 so warning very powerful message it's just law l8w law powerful message whoo let us drop you're struggling a lot of times people we struggle blowing grace law in Greece or in Greece you know condemns us oh you didn't do this you didn't do that hello that little boy with the two fish and loaves of bread that's all he did to further all his life and God I counted it as holiness or righteousness winning the witan went into the holy ghost book of fame well that lady with two pieces two little mice that's all she had to do but we feel like we got to just be laying hands on the sick every day raising the dead opening the eyes and I see I have a battle and I've had a battle because I want to do something for God but jesus said you know that zeal let's put it this way I can't do nothing except the father show me so if God ain't showing you don't you worry about it hallelujah but God has his way I'm showing you some time he speak directly sometimes he put the impression on your heart sometimes he reveals something to you you didn't see no vision or anything but somehow a word of knowledge is in you and you know the person is going to be healed in he has various ways of speaking and when he speaks to you you know to do it and it's done you saw old brother Brooks we know when when I must have done something wrong let me ask you something Jonah got mad got angry with God did y'all know that Joe Lobeck got angry with God cuz Nineveh repented God even brought a Goergen and put it over him and shaded him from the Sun and when the gorge died he he got upset like he was the one that created it what attitude and yet he still was a prophet of God brother Aaron got up status in law you you all need explanation God don't owe you nothing and you know what the prophet of God said when I stop pouting that's when he came pouting like a child what was it six months something like that you understand what I'm trying to say what I'm saying is your attitude will either draw God nearer or push him backwards but he'll never leave you he said I'll never leave you nor will our first sake you all right I'm a coach on this he says now it is a strange thing that this is so much thought other people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say Jordan you're just talking his language right now right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony become negative let it be positive all the time I am saying I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come into your life if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that that'd be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could surely stopped them from roosting so that that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus is my Savior all things are mind by God I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as lovely this is the big part God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you right see the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he says that he's a high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it oh I just gave the devil a big black eye hmm he said well let let me tell you something I just found this particular quote it has been there all the time but what I needed it this is when it came right I don't hoarder perhaps I've heard it but today today it made a difference ello that's dad God is a good god there are there are and there is no reason we shouldn't miss a rapture with all of these promises and all we got to do is trust them trust God and believe God maybe you don't look right now you may be an ugly duckling or something like that maybe in this stage of life you look like a fish instead of a man however the promises of God are yay trust in people you gotta trust him you know it's just like Mary when when Joseph Joseph inspired by the enemy you know he he didn't know the promises was true he didn't realized that that that what Mary was saying was true God had not given him that revelation so he said I moonstone I'm not gonna bring make her a public show but I'm on stone or in privacy I'm gonna take her out there in stone and he was gonna do it had not the end of the Lord come to her Josephus says no don't kill her this really is true but you see what the devil want they want to kill her testimony that's why brother branham's really went against her in her testimony where she said you know at the temple your father and I we're looking for you she knew what she was saying she had to make a choice and at that time she denied her own supernatural experience with the angel hello and that's what we do sometimes let me tell you something amen god is my father and you know when Jesus got in trouble when he says I and my father are one you know when the bride's gets in trouble when she comes to that place where she can say I and my father are one that's not a mental thing that is an expression that has now made itself manifested when the squeeze come you see what I'm talking about it's coming and it's so close now things are just chaotic chaotic i don't even keep up with stuff no more yeah yeah is that right okay it messes with your mind let me stay like Peter did see Peter said no look at all these things going on in the Oh My look at that mist and he took his eyes off Jesus for just a moment and he began to sink keep your eyes on Jesus you don't need to know news cuz you ain't going to be here when it happens God gonna take you if you keep your eyes on Jesus see what I'm saying all the stuff is vexations it's distractions it has been for me maybe not for others but for me this is what it's been so I don't even look at it no more I don't I said Lord I gotta trust you I don't care if they just kill somebody at Walmart y'all understand me I wasn't there and you know what I go back to the thing that the Lord showed me and I know it was God he said when Noah was in the ark do you thinking nor was there wondering about who was out there drowning he knew everybody that wasn't in the ark was out there drowning was he saying oh lord have mercy God that already had mercy the word was their mercy and they failed to take heed to the word hallelujah there's no more revival in America the revival is in the bride that's it she spurned her day and everything is gonna get worse love fighting the Bible said as it was in Genesis in the days of Noah that's what we're living in right now men are multiplying violence in the land blood you name it that's what it is as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot and you know the two things great things violence multiplying the people right and perversion we hear and if we are here the bride is making herself ready and what was she doing what was she doing taking the ranch of some promise in spite of all of the laughter she was taking and holding on to that promise and as she held on that promise she was working keeping herself true to the promise that's all God expect for you to do keep yourself true to the promise let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love we just thank you for being so good to us keep my eyes focused Lord oh god sometimes we slip sometimes we stumble sometimes we fall but I just know and believe in the hallelujah that you have called me to be bride Jesus I can't explain it Lord but I just know it to be true oh god I pray Lord God that you move us closer and higher and deeper oh God into that love Lord to that like to let like to spell all the darkness in us help us now as we press toward the mark of a high calling which is in you Lord let us modify the deeds of our flesh let us separate ourselves from everything of the world Oh God keep us pure keep us clean let the mind be in us that was in Christ Jesus and Christ always kept himself focused and in a place where he could always hear from you help us Lord that we'll be just like he is in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray gonna be

want to be all of this holler you did you know that there were times the Saints glowed is that right the Bible said when they were stoning Stephen leicht shine his face shine the glory of God was all over him that's what I'm saying when the persecution is on when I'm going through trials I won't go on a sad countenance I want that light well I said Lord hold these things not to their charge right I wanted to be so that I have such a love for people that I can really really really really love my enemies hallelujah whether they be in the house be on the street or whatever because when we realize him and the enemies of the devil and not the people it give us a grace to pity them to feel sorry and pray for them you love the Lord all right there's no place like home folks I go places but there's
