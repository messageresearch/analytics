he's Almighty Hallelujah now as we stand I want to live on bass that you turn with us the Hebrew the 11th chapter and the sixth verse hallelujah hallelujah glad to have everybody here tonight God is God Amen and he's worthy to be praised I was thinking about that song today or yesterday [Music] praise is what I do Hallelujah what can what else can you give him he's given us everything that we need two storms Hebrews 11 chapter will read the uh sixth verse but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him or sonafua is I read a quote coming from Ministries explained 7-Eleven faith is a positive sense positive it's not a guesswork they say you don't imagine it it's just as real as any other sense of your body just the same as as sight is [Music] hearing is real [Music] see taste feel smell and hear the five senses of the body that controls the body the sanctions they're real faculties to you if you if none of them is injured is just as real as any of the others it goes in and above those five senses Hallelujah let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being so good to us have been better to us and then we've been to ourselves we often say this Lord because it stands true life right no one can love us the way you love us no one can care for us the way you care for it no one can take care of us father you are a mastermind you're the greatest of all and we're so thankful for serving the true amen amen you may be seated we just thank the Lord for his Amazing Grace one of the things that really uh have me ministering tonight just just faith we live by faith it is our substance and as we said previously faith is not a thing the funny person shows it's reality it's a person and of course brother random teaches us he said we're probably saying the importance of Faith because he said faith is a revelation Revelation in the exposition of the church ages he speaks and says the importance of Revelation by the spirit is to a True Believer can never be over emphasized Revelation means more to you then perhaps you realize now I am not talking about this book of Revelation in you I am talking about all Revelations it is tremendously see Matthew's more important to the church and foreign Hallelujah and when Peter said Lord we believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah and then Jesus responded upon the Flesh and Blood have not revealed this to you but my father had revealed it Hallelujah and Upon This Rock upon this Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation Hallelujah he said it's on the god saith alone why others are trying to learn this message the bride of Christ knows that she needs that Revelation Hallelujah because even brother Branham says that when you read the words you gotta read the words knowing that there's something in between the lines she knows how to read between the lies Nation does for you that's what Revelation does for me you're Jesus what's not interested in what other people were saying about him some say you're Jeremiah some say that you are Elias or one of the other prophets but that wasn't the question because you got to understand Revelations is an individual thing this is not a group revelation of an individual what do you say about this message somebody help me here what do you say guess about this message what is your revelation of this message yes sir you know what it is it's many things but when when you see this message you literally see Jesus and that was what brother Branham wanted us to see this is the housing he was looking he was interested in a scene he wasn't pointing at himself Hallelujah now this hello Revelation call it the foundation Revelation because the foundation of this building and the faith is the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ Peter's greatest of all Revelation was this one see this will receive because if you build a house and the house is being built on seeking science when the storms built upon the Rocks the rock is not even Jesus that the rock is the revelation of who Jesus Christ is he wasn't the second person of the Trinity he was the third person of the Trinity it was God himself [Music] and the Bible says they were filled with the Holy Ghost understand who Jesus is he was the Christ Hallelujah he is the Holy Ghost so that Jesus that was in the body of one man the body of 120.50 thank you now in this day God saw the Revelation and he said no man yeah he kept on moving that's the way it is a revelation in the Bible said without faith Hallelujah is that right here in the ministry explains I'm gonna read that quote again faith is a positive sense see he tastes feel smell and hear hallelujah amen the five sensations of the body that controls the body the same songs they're real faculties to you this is none of them is injured insane it's just as real yes any of the other five senses because it goes in and above the five senses when the Five Sisters says it's impossible yes [Music] time was created y'all hear what I'm saying everything was created by faith Hallelujah now what is God doing now actually building a new creation this creation can only [Music] [Music] to believe that he was wrong in his you yeah never slapped himself without a witness even when King slew Abel man lost God raised themselves and the Bible says [Music] he even said to the children of Israel if you fail to worship me cause them to cry out you hear what I'm saying so we don't come to church [Music] [Music] [Music] La parole amen [Music] Hallelujah you can say you can say wanna say God already told me I'm already here wait till the change what he's already told me now what God is doing now he's in the creation business Revelation says that Jesus Christ is the beginning of the conception of God what is God doing things he's creating himself right in the church age book don't leave this that's what God told us that Jesus Christ Jesus creates himself God creates himself now you got to understand what he's doing because he's now multiplying and I'm one of them somebody to say how do God's multiply one time a million um um and you're still here they need to drop off y'all hear what I'm saying so when we get to heaven in the bride that no man can number okay it'll still be one [Laughter] Hallelujah this new creation is the creation of himself so what did Jesus Christ do what is he doing he's creating his bride now it takes Faith to believe that you you're the bride it's a revelation nobody can take it from you hear me you'll make a lot of mistakes [Music] [Music] he can't even break it himself Peter denied them three times [Music] [Applause] [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying oh my God is this okay it's okay see the Devil is a man and I'm so glad he missed this Soul he thought he had he born I love the Lord amen listen to the program says Ponzi the key is faith statue of a perfect man paragraph let me see where I'm at now I just miss my place here you okay yep whatever I did I missed it I'll find it yeah so we know that the key is Faith Hallelujah and we don't have to worry about nothing the faith holds the key and the key is the scripture and Christ is the door y'all hear what I'm saying all I'm saying is this if you can see what I'm saying he called himself the open door is that right he calls himself the shepherd I mean everything that symbolizes of righteousness and Holiness he said I stand at the door now Hallelujah if anybody Hallelujah but in this case the book is the door the Bible says [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah that mysterious words foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah and when God drops Revelation in your heart [Music] it's not given to everybody Hallelujah you love the Lord of the scripture and unlocks the glories and good of God is so so it's Faith who's the key that unlocks Christina how are you going to understand this message if you truly don't believe your bride components you can believe that the message was written for somebody else but the message was written for you because we've gone with this message for a long time change have you seen in the people here today [Music] Hallelujah if this is a word of God glory to God thank you Jesus So today we're going to try and take that same key not the way to become a virtuous Christians Tabernacle for the Living God yes Hallelujah it's what we want right we just want we don't want to be a denominator Hallelujah we want to be like like like those at the gate are beautiful but the church is sampler [Music] La Bandon Hallelujah is that right right when Rebecca saw Isaac in the fields she was acting out surrendered y'all hear what I'm saying watch the scripture amen because the bride his order to hurt for her to be accepted by her husband Jesus Christ is that all right that's the truth a lot of people and you know you people say well I I surrendered but you don't know you ain't you're not even praying if you're not a prayer you don't know how to pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah we live by faith so in this in this mess the statue of a perfect man so when you surrender your complete being holy place then the Holy Spirit just pours through you paragraph 360 sorry okay I'll understand this please but how many people are going to surrender at all we're living in such a deceptive age the Bible said even the love of the world show the life of God out of them and you know we can see the entire everybody yeah it is my heart is I will receive everything from God I don't care about the housings priorities make sure you got him what will the game what would it Prosper a man say no words oh my God hallelujah so when you surrender your complete being complain then the Holy Ghost just pours through you know these virtues don't say virtue when you live when you're a living Tabernacle if people look out and say uh that's a man full of virtue who says brotherly kindness if we've got that kind of love be able to love each other that's nothing but the truth see there he is walking around Marshall what is it a statue that's um unbelievers can't look at and say is a statue that unbelievers can look at inside he's a man or a woman I'm talking about Hallelujah you've never seen a kinderly a person you're sealed on both sides whether you're going or coming or a woman this is this foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you Hallelujah [Music] that's what we want this is [Music] see then the word comes from here it manifest itself through each one of these beings is to Manifesto see and makes the complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a living example of Christianity an example [Music] what Christ was these people are yes as he is so are we in this life Hallelujah hey glory to God Roger right they are in Christ and their life is dead sealed in there by the Holy Ghost First Corinthians 12. that's right it's exactly you reckon Yourself Dead virtue and these other things is added to to you till you're perfect if I didn't get into your life Hallelujah before they can cross over to Jordan so you gotta understand that you can't go there you sanctify yeah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah don't you know in one prayer session you completely feel to copy more complete you totally surrendered completely get busy with it now some of you may already be there but if you're not there still having issues y'all hear what I'm saying because a dead man no more can't kick another man right amen if you dead she said mom somebody can kick you okay and you won't respond what if somebody come and slap you in your face oh see what I'm saying y'all got quiet but see that's the kind you gotta have says the nature of God how are we going to uh when the squeeze when it does come how are we going to overcome without the Lamb's nature you can be a Peter and you fight with the sword if you die but Peter became a lamb and when they told Peter you got to die to say I'm ready but don't crucify me like my Lord turn me upside down hey brother he knew he was going to die so the steering wheel will be taken out of my hands told about his accidents it's like John at John news [Music] Hallelujah [Music] see those lamb natures all the Christians they didn't have to pull and drag on them when they were in the arena those Lions on them into history according to Josephus not from the Lions they don't know scripture says [Music] hallelujah see that's what take a lot of people out anyhow take people out because they are so afraid to die foreign look at all those things we got these songs are you afraid this is the moment I've been living foreign in and then God he put you through that has brought us seven Church ages you know Jesus said they said this message is this message is not to burden you so massage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah amen oh come on somebody even Jesus loved Judas he remembers the life that Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know the people that's going to suffer the most out of all the Christians will be the message [Music] I love the Lord and being God has brought us to sages to show the seven steps building his individual he built a complete Church in his images Perfection of Christ comes into you know uh Joseph when he killed the Egyptians yeah I don't want to say it wrong I'm saying something wrong I think Moses Moses Moses yes with Moses kill the Egyptian Egyptian Hallelujah it cost them 40 more years 40 more years they had to stay in Egypt for 40 more years Hallelujah because what Moses mother taught him [Music] Hallelujah take off your shoes [Music] Hallelujah yes sir amen glory to God and so you look at this before God this is he comes alone and like I said it cost him 40 more years but you know he's got a way of doing it let's bring in the squeeze because we've been lazy with it like this when the rain started falling away he said the door was already shot he said when the World Council of churches he's coming toward the bride is already so now is your time to make sure you get inside Hallelujah amen you love the Lord okay faith is a revelation La Fortune Revelation what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God I always think about Inna does the prophet God use Enoch is not example the Bible said that Enoch please and you know what people think is that Enoch may have been just perfect a man born in sinful nature but you gotta read between the lines it had to be a blood that's the only way that could have been perfect do you really think job was perfect in himself [Music] with the life that made him overcome [Music] glory to God now when you sealed amen it doesn't mean that you're going to go out here and raise the dead could everybody believed that when they get sealed they're going to be doing all of these great things no you may not do nothing but be a dishwasher the life of God is in you Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm trying to say because that's the way Pentecostal thing when I get when I get the Holy Ghost oh I can just do whatever God wants me to do no no no no when you really got the Holy Ghost when you truly see it with the Holy Ghost your bride will not do one thing until she get a dust set alarm Hallelujah you may have all the power look at the prophet of God he said to many times if I could heal you I would he said but I can't do it she is a revelation he has revealed to you by his grace it's nothing you did yeah you didn't you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God God reveals it it excuse me and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation so I'm gonna close in just a moment how many people you know that I've heard this message and can't believe it turn away from it but something has you yeah and no matter what the people in the message go through you know it's right that's that's the Revelation that keeps you y'all hear what I'm saying it's not about your do's and don'ts it's God's grace toward you it's God's favor and believe you me with that type of Revelation you must be bride because that's true there is no way of you can turn back oh yeah where are you going to go Peter said Lord where are we going to go you have the words to eternal life there's no other place you're going to go to some of these preachers out there Hallelujah they charge you seven thousand dollars just to be healed hallelujah oh people wake up I'm already healed and he saw you he became my sin that I might become the righteousness of God hallelujah that settles it Hallelujah let the blood of Jesus Christ forever be applied to your life do you have trust the word hallelujah one more quote and I'll let you go coming from the Rapture message oh I feel pretty good in my soul but to the church paragraph 65 I'm sorry but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it reveals to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture Hallelujah now you got to listen to what brother random is saying because he's saying it and yet he's not saying it he almost speaks in Parables just to choke people up is that what Jesus did Jesus spoke in Parables Hallelujah now I don't know about y'all but I'm already in the Rapture Dishonored what do you mean I haven't changed yet but I'm changing from glory to glory I'm in the process already we just waiting for the end of it y'all hear what I'm saying is that right see the Bible says told John come on up here in other words you can't receive this Eagle message on the ground being Earthbound you got to come up higher y'all understand me your mind must become the mind of Christ Hallelujah and so when your mind become the mind of Christ you connect with him Hallelujah and he's going to tell you things he's not going to tell nobody else now I'm gonna ask you a question when you traveled and you burdened and all of a salt and certain a song comes to your heart a Christian song a song that lifts you up have you ever thought about who sent it and all of a sudden you just hear it in your head then you started singing it and all of a sudden now you're feeling encouraged you did that you think the devil sentence that was God he's comforting you and a lot of times we let it go right on by and we don't even know it see he promised us I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you hear me y'all hear me he's in the valley he's on the Mountaintop wherever you are he's there with you that's it that's the truth now let me finish it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation unfortunately because there's something that's revealed to you Faith it's a revelation foreign [Music] that's right tell our devil you have to preach to him sometimes before Hallelujah Hallelujah like Abraham they call those things they contrary to what what have been revealed to him it's though it wasn't so um that that's what faith is just like in a foreign now I say these things by the grace of God because the oncoming days no note this is the closer you try to get to God please the more Satan is going to fight you so you know all of a sudden you're moving forward when the devil come after you um don't fear him because God is controlling everything what what Satan intend to be your instructor destruction we take that same thing and cause it to be your footstools because we're moving higher Hallelujah and I'll tell you another thing in closing you don't know how bad you are you trying to get closer to God when that light starts shining on you oh my god cause you're not the one that's doing the cleaning it's the whole experience right so you may understand what I'm saying you can clean and wash your face don't wash your hands but there's a place that needs to be cleaned yeah but you gotta ask him to do something then when the pressure comes when you ask God to work on your behalf you think it's strange when you fall into
