judea into gambling jesus said unto him go thy way thy son and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way come on and as he was now going down my servants madame i told him saying thy son liveth he loved yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left me questioned so the father knew it was at the same hour in which jesus said unto him thy son liveth jesus this again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judea into galilee may the lord bless the reading of his word the second miracle it's a sermon and i found that my spirit was more closer to this that's real among us if god did a miracle before based on something and if somebody by this this morning i just want you to read over in verse 52. then inquired he of them the hour when he began to a man i don't know why jesus did not heal the sun in the first hour and as we're living in the seventh hour the church cannot go through that [Music] [Music] all those things have to go
