whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of baca will make it a well known they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appears no

lord the weak fortified turkey encourage those that are now sick lord those that thirst lord may you give them water in the name of jesus christ amen amen well uh i didn't ask my pastor i didn't know i was going to be up here but i'm sure if we could call him right now he would be sending greetings in the name of jesus christ so keep our little assembly assembly in the point ohio uh ohio in prayer and this assembly here in iowa is always on our hearts amen you have a a wonderful fine pastor there is that pastel a real man of god and we're not to take confidence in the flesh amen so this morning i'd like to teach on maybe restoration and these first couple of scriptures we spoke here and you'll stay in the presence of god it waxes you stronger not necessarily in the flesh he increases strength you look more slightly good how many feel stronger now than they did a year ago [Applause] do we feel stronger right now than we did last week [Applause] he said someone might say he says when i the first time i received the baptism of the holy ghost he said if you answer that you're backsliding refilling after refilling on peace more i play on please smoke hey man amen yes that's exactly right praise god send you out so we had a wonderful brother come and preach for us last week brother craig brewer he's a soldier and our pastor let him go and preach and you know what he preached on that divine love amen amen we were rejoicing have a wonderful time then my pastor told me you're next and i said lord how do i follow that up come on and so i asked the lord and through working the next couple days the lord put something on my heart yes sir you're saying and i'd like to express it this morning by god's grace to you you know as the as the prophet of god was in the sermons he said one morning he was laying there with his arms behind his head on my face and that night he was dreaming having so many dreams and he kept waking up after the dream [Music] and he said he heard a voice say he says just keep pressing all right in 61 the voice said you're just getting started he said keep pressing keep resting and then the voice said what he said he says would you like to go beyond the curtain of time he told you and he said it would so much help him and we know that uh the lord took him out of his body and you said he said you all know live here and took him up into the heavenly realm don't don't destroy and it's all these massive people and you know how the story went he says oh the angel said the angel said they're all these mines are all these branhams and i'm going to pick up right here as he's now pressing he he's just got back into his box remember he described how beautiful [Music] he said suddenly i was back in my bed again he said oh god help me that he's so senior oh jewel never let me compromise on the word let me stay [Music] he says lord let me press to that beautiful place he said i've never been more convincing ever in my life individually are you expressing perfect love [Applause] are you conscious of the holy ghost being right here right now when you leave this place today will you will you be conscious of the holy ghost as you leave do we hurt our brothers and sisters at all do we hurt our brothers how are we going to be conscious of the holy spirit if amen amen praise god he says he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get that perfect love yeah don't do school amen all's well now if we need divine love that perfect love you know what's happening do you sit down move is that that more back that what does it take to get there we're almost but before you can have divine faith you must have amen so let me let me work a little bit here by god's great fear he brought it down and he took some clay and some potassium [Music] from the ground he blew on it and crazy and he created a body for adam and that was a man's body it's a then called he was a direct son of god but remember if he was god's direct son mr so adam found himself living in perfection and day by day he would go about keeping the garden [Music] working this and working and one every night the god would come down in the cool the evening and he'd say adam how was your day today and adam said lord it was perfect the weather was just right he said i got to pet this animal [Applause] he felt something and he didn't know what it was something and the bible says that god said it's not good for man to dwell alone amen so an even in all this perfection it don't do such perfection the prophet of god said adam got lonely even in the perfect body he still felt alone man those are called and god feels the same way many times amen how is our prayer life amen how is our prayer alive can we pray without ceasing that's gonna be also says amen amen amen and god said it's not good to dwell alone awakening coming off [Laughter] and next to him is this other being and he says who are you is i can't imagine that original uh conversation hey man amen and as they would walk through the garden and it coincides don't you put your mouth shut on the shoulder now he had to help me to help keep adam and eve walking through the garden i don't have my ceiling shot down and the prince of the power of the air brings down a harsh fierce wind in the planets eve holding her husband's hand i i i haven't done to solve this on this song i don't adam that's what's what's going on with that weird absolute sequence of survivors what did how did adam react to that wind in the wind call me as they continued on do you think adam said stupid wind uh i don't have a uh uh that was not god's nature enemy coming now back from work hello i don't have kid heading into their little place in the garden and just weeks ago it walked along that same path hello don't remember and they had passed a certain tree a tree's branch may have gotten a little too big too far and eve's like adam how do we pass past this tree how do we get past this grown over yeah would say hold on eve hey i don't perfect you i have i told you tree up root and move over there yeah don't put it here supernaturally is supernatural anymore that tree would move over sit sit sit down with it continue on do you think adam would say i don't idea that stupid tree oh sit sit sit sit down boys what's wrong with that tree kiss kissing about bad that sits his downpour that was not his nature amen amen he adam thought nothing of the wind he thought nothing of that tree he was not alone amen amen he had god's nature amen amen now you know you know in 1957 the prophet of god was speaking and he's preached this he's dealing with uh stand still and see the salvation lord 57. he says and the waves are about to tear a little ship to pieces he says there was a lonely galilean laying in the boat asleep and i thought why the prophet called jesus lonely hey [Music] [Applause] then the second adam must experience loneliness as well i don't reduce him i don't [Music] they would prophesy to them he said this body will raise in three days and even simon peter says it shall not come unto thee he could send a revelation to i keep moving on bryce and now christ our god almighty because when god speaks he speaks spiritual spiritual experience so he would need someone spiritual hello to be able to pick up what he's talking about hey man praise god but we're dealing now we dealt with what the character of adam you know there was nothing evil in adam yeah oh i don't and the bible says in genesis three he don't we know this is review we know this is review but that word subtopic means connie uh um crafty seven has a type of a smoothness about him but it's always the as the definition says in a bad sense [Music] now let's take it look back here at cain hello look out could you tell me where that spirit and that meanness come from there was nature hello physique he like you're not true then there's anymore one time i was at home and my dad was watching my dogs and he had a bone in his mouth and my dad was watching and that male dog was just licking and chewing that bone just pop it in with his teeth and he stayed out there for a half an hour having a good time just sucking on that bone so my dad was time to switch dogs going out and he took that bone and he dug a hole and he buried that bone in that hole and then he scraped the dirt on top of it but little did little benjamin know man and my dog come back in and my dad switched dogs and that female dog went out [Music] she went out wagging her tail and if you don't and she went directly to where that bone was buried and she dug that bone upon feeling like he covered his tracks and my dad said the dog's eyes went hey that animal nature see it's natural down your mind has no fear to steal that animal nature has no fear yeah to go behind someone's back the greatest proof i can find in genesis if you look in in the bible in genesis 1. on day 5. [Music] god creates the fish yeah [Music] and the bible says that god blessed them amen but moving into the sixth day god but at the end of his animal creations he never said it was good because it would have to remain good but the bible said he saw that it was good he left no blessing but notice on the second half of the sixth day [Applause] and we see in that sixth day that god blessed you and when god blesses the bible says he cannot lie he cannot irrevocable so if the god's children are blessed i don't see this on for the jews they are blessed amen even in the old testament covenant with abraham um god bless abraham and even in that temporary blessing covenant however you want to say it don't say said i cannot curse what god has been blessed amen so at the fall of adam and eve i don't have they are guilty and god does not curse adam and eve but when he did not bless the end of life he left an opening and by that offering now he could curse the serpents but remember whatever is blessed is how was god able to curse cain come on if he was blessed in genesis impossible that curse right there came proved who was his daddy he says now notice what the prophet of god says here i don't know look out this is going to point back to georgie cain he says took the nature of his daddy he says now kneeling with cases that pure that nature could not come out of a pure stream yeah compare the two seed lines compare the two seedlings they do simmers in genesis 4. you look at kane and what do you produce cayenne circular poetry polygamy platform metallurgy metallurgy just working metal let me tell you another murderer and the amount i was like this a serial killer he killed two men that was what cain's nature but in genesis 5. they don't that sink as you run and these are the generations of adam yeah you don't see any evil nature coming up in his genius [Music] and for the most part but where did the sons of god mess up his own father we know that we're directly after abel uh seth came forth so directly one after adam they started to get in the presence of god again amen but the bible says what the sons of god saw the daughters of man unfortunately they found his own and what took place right there it becomes the mixing now and now what adam's race is truly polluted amen adam's race is truly polluted as the prophet of god taught come to prophet how did that seedline get through the ark you only have one option and that noah's sons married serpent seed that don't i displaying itself within a few bursts after the flood don't don't don't don't get caught and the bible says in second peter one and 4. he says whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises [Music] that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through love praise the lord yes when we get jealous when we get angry come [Laughter] well this sister did this oh and this brother did that that is not the nature of god that is adam comes to where abel was killed i can't even understand this is adam knew nothing of that nature i don't know competition competition is not the nature of god brother amen unless the devil's in your core when the spirit starts messing with your family he's trying to take dominion he don't you have every right to cast it out he is challenging your authority [Applause] amen and we were given all authority by jesus take over america amen praise god now in romans 7 i don't don't live with the woman saints of god it talks about how the bible the bible says the holy seed of god was mingled you know [Music] you know why because that's not our nature something but we've got to understand what those are that is that animal nature trapped in this flesh well the devil made me do it oh it's your jabber my fifth answer no sir [Laughter] brother said what he says my greatest enemy is william branham bring them he wasn't talking about the soul realm he was not talking about the holy ghost in him about your sentence he was talking about this com this completed flesh [Music] billy paul was asked what's the greatest miracle you ever see brother graham do billy paul on graphic demand they can't call me like her because jeffrey why not fail he treated his enemies and his loved ones with absolutely no differences and i come up to big abraham over here and i start roughing them up and i push them on the ground back there brother abraham is going to get back up the i'm sure i'll see divine love in his eyes wide open he says come here little guy you know wrap those big old arms around me so i love you anyhow bro and at that moment my heart will start breaking and i'll say brother you got to forgive me i said i saint paul said of his life saint paul d don't say be received the baptism of the holy ghost that was true descent you have never seen a sentence and at the time when he wrote the book of romans that when i do good evil is present with me was he talking about the devil you need to escalate no sir no was he talking about evil spirits escalated the effects of the fall do that shoot he was exposing what our forefathers he did don't try to expose this chicken no pan he said they mixed they hydrated he's this animal nature sits natural that you mind he said oh wretched man that i am um who shall deliver me from the devil give him a daily bread dude doesn't say that no who will deliver me from hell doesn't say that he says who will deliver me from the body of this death ourselves to this morning praise be to god galatians 5 and 16. verses and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh see we can never lean on the i was like this on the uh uh the effects that adam had in other words the nature of the adam had in the beginning that is why we need the baptism of the holy ghost we will never be able to conquer this flesh until we receive a refilling or a feeling of the holy spirit [Music] i failed so brother rich shared me brother i failed so much brother i think i feel more new [Laughter] i mean brother rich can get into it for half an hour so i do this well man we need help right there not only do we have this flesh wants to do nothing good you can hand pick any sin has anyone conquered this yet raise their hands i might look at everybody here well that little boy right there is a conqueror he's got it oh my god you'll be up tonight lord william explain how to do that the bible said if you be led of the spirit you're not under what the law uh now saint paul gave a list of things hello saint paul donated released to the shows let's just let's just in romans uh let's see here look i don't want to hit that yes in romans 1 29. he is dealing with those who are given to a reprobate and these this mind gave them over to do things and all six cities said sponsor i know i picked out the shows which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness of all unrighteousness haters of god and be despiteful inventors of evil things [Music] disobedient to parents saints of god think of what i just said these are all natural these are nature these are animal natures they're the big buck and the little doe get married they don't get married he reproduces with as many as he can animal nature there is no marriage so the devil comes right up to the serpent man he's like see mrs serpent there he is that and the prophet of god says god created humanity a little bit different humanity that the female was more beautiful than the male 1 satan going to the serpent was [Music] because adam's wife had more beauty basically amen amen the bible says here without understanding witness the simplicity of baptism yeah it is just an experience you you you back down and they don't understand it in the complaint past that now i i talked to some this is not aimed at anyone in this church we want divine love right amen well i have the holy ghost intercepted and you know i still fall here let's just come to punch what a slay odyssey and sometimes i don't feed the white dog enough yeah man sometimes i don't feed the white dog enough amen amen let me hit this does anyone know what the word lignity means this is one of the natures of the animal animal kingdom specifically the serpent nature malignity the you know you know there was four anointings in the seven church ages the first was the lion from what the man anointing soldiers wrote of which consists in misinterpreting the words or actions of others the second second there is action result or putting the worst construction on their conduct construction you know i woke up this morning brother brooks didn't give me a hug four books my [Laughter] when someone does something to you you and then you form a complex complex this guy's got something against him and he don't hello you built that entire thing that's serpent nature amen whisperers whisperers that would be sorry but romans 1 well i can't read that oh what does the word whispers mean covered yeah or in a sly manner by hints or innuendos just detract from others or incite suspicion upon them said that these are the most dangerous of all the people i've been guilty of this many times you hear something preached or however and [Laughter] [Music] and leaving it right there it deals useless it's enough to tell the brother i was talking to him that there's something wrong with that other brother [Music] i didn't have to go into any detail i didn't have to disclose any other information but i put a negative twist on the and even more by your hey man despiteful um that would be sorry brother romans 1 30. sorry technical errors despite voices this word denotes those who abuse or treat unkindness or disdain those that are present when you're not there coz by that this right here does it plainly and openly amen i'm guilty but i've repented amen now let's continue on because i don't continue even the prophet of god said even those that are walking in the spirit he says you still have to watch us because satan can slip in things could go going so smooth with the holy ghost and you watch the devil try and slip it and hint or something or cause confusion amen amen in ephesians two and one no huh let's just jump to three here um wait for our brother here to get there is this plane yeah man let's go see is this clear and we're gonna hit a quote and i'm gonna we're gonna end on this quote here coming up do you even display brotherly kindness divine patience among those also we had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the divine the desires even as others see that nature that that wicked nature we display all the time that is animal nature now continue on here because i don't continue now brother branham he deals you remember what he said about justification he said justification is when what he says you've never done it in the first place when you and god truly justifies you let me just read it howie because it's beautiful he says it is see he says for instance he deep example if brother green see plot green he says heard that i've been out drinking and doing bad things forgive me and if god has truly justified you and you catch that revelation that we are obligated to look at your brother and sister the same way absolutely the truth when you look at your brother and sister you better be looking at jesus christ you better not speak anything evil of them because why the same judgment you bring to someone else that's going to remind you because your man will be brought unto you [Music] i'm a plumber back home i'm a plumber back home [Music] and i mess up i also weld sometimes and i always confess to my screw-ups sorry boss i i messed up here in this room [Music] you say brother i have the baptism of the holy ghost do you know how to get that divine love that that brother bran was talking about in the current of time with because we should be growing stronger wronger so how are we going to bypass this serpent nature hello come on i don't i don't know uh basis it's natural to cell phone he says there on the inside he only has one gate to take over in the control tower [Music] [Music] in other words you have to die out to yourself every time i get a thought or desire i shut in ponce one day or a plan i want to do in my life one blonde because you've been found on my feet i must go back and see if that's what the lord wants to do he says whether to you or not that's up to you if you yield to self-will he said that's the only avenue that's open to the man that god can come into his heart is by self-will in articulation [Music] the prophet says he says when a man is converted the prophetic economy true baptism of the holy ghost is free he said the holy ghost comes down like a little white button is [Music] the bible says you are sealed until the day of your redemption but that still doesn't kill this nature he says now he can let that spirit grow hello you your temple is the temple of the holy ghost he paid the price for you he purchased you on calvary because i i i i i still can't that blood was shed for you society so what you could receive then that life of jesus christ and you have to yield even to receive the holy ghost stay back praise be to god yes don't miss this once we receive this you then have to start yielding he says he can let that spirit grow and take all the roots of bitterness it is [Music] and he recites word for word [Music] until he conquers that just he can't go any further you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] you can have you could that first time you received the holy ghost now put me on big you're still bride because that's it but there's been no growth [Music] i've repented he says and when he presses he says he says when he gets all these things out of the way i don't think i'll have two shows audrey that man that gets all this out of the way all this sit down even the spirit realm memories he could come back to the same condition that adam was in the garden [Music] it's literally that simple amen repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but that is the beginning of the war how many soldiers are here come here saints of god we have been fighting and fighting and fighting amen you better get your sword sharpened prepare for scriptural war for no reason the prophet didn't say prepare for scripture war for no reason [Music] he says as he says he can come back into the garden of eden condition [Music] [Music] he said that puts him right in the supreme again it puts them back in the condition but we have to put this in the subjection menu why would saint paul say i crucify this flesh daily i am so tired of feeling down fatigue do something i'm so tired you sweet fat tiki but when someone offends me i get angry don't get killed students should move fast i'm so tired of when someone does something to me should you shoot fights get called can't come on pickaxe from a fake shoes my first thought is to nitpick them dude [Music] when someone does something to me i can't come with fake shoes i don't want to think any evil when something happens to me bad as you would think okay i want to have nothing but good thoughts the bible says to give thanksgiving to jesus christ in all things you don't think tough times are coming i'm friends with the man who just married an australian [Music] they're only allowed to go outside for one to two hours [Music] [Music] well i've got a long time to live i'd like to do this or i'd like to do that outside the outside be prepared to lay it down those middle aged seeds well i have got the retirement to look forward to in my opinion um my retirement i've got to lay it down for those who are a little bit older [Music] finish strong [Laughter] everybody okay hey man praise god let's just raise our hands rededicate our lives to the holy ghost many of us may be saved many of us have received the holy ghost but let's dedicate our lives to him once again and say lord have i have i even grown up we came to the house of god today did we are we going to go away with something or not i don't know brother this might not be so deep [Music] do they say man that is a man full of divine love you know in the in the bible so they were called they were called christians [Music] [Music] dearly father lord jesus lord as we try to yield the best lord we could to you [Music] lord you know the entire time i'm thinking about myself [Music] lord i want to lay down all the worldly
