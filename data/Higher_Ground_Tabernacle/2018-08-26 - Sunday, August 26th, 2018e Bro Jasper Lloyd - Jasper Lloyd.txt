speak to us O God from the realms of heaven and bless us O God and just give us what we stand in need of we'll be careful to give you no glory and all the praise in Jesus name that the church say man amen god bless you amen so good to be back amen and we just want to amen get in the word just a little bit more amen are you still hungry amen do you believe that God can speak to us just a little more from the words of eternity amen and so we want to look in first Corinthians 15 amen if you would just move there for a moment first Corinthians 15 there are three verses I want to read there and then we'll read from Genesis chapter one amen but first Corinthians 15 and there I want to read three verses out of first Corinthians 15 and then we read Genesis 1:26 amen so gymnast first Princeton's 15 verse 47 through 49 is what I want to read it says the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is the Lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly what is our promise as we and as we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly do you believe that hallelujah amen one we can testify of and so the second one you've testified of amen and it shall be even as you have testified Genesis chapter 1 and I'm just gonna read three verses there twenty-six three verses 26 through 28 and it reason God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea oh the fowl of the air and over some all right I just want make sure you reading and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth may the Lord bless his reading of the word a man you may be seated amen amen so so not this evening I'm just want to share a few words here now amen I want to last through the last savory moments of this amen so be kind of just a little teaching maybe like a little Sunday School lesson just some things we already know amen but we'll just do some checks and balances that's okay amen amen and so I want to talk about rebuilding the Christian image that's my message this afternoon is rebuilding the Christian image amen and so in looking at this you know there was a term I think I'm just thinking as far as I know he and research Andre Agassi I guess is the one that coined the term image is everything and so that's how we want to look at the text of this message that image is everything and we know God Amen uses types and shadows and so many times when you can't see the real you need to take a look closer at the shadow and sometimes you you know you just need them both there amen and so that's what we want to look at there that God wants us to see his image Amen now a mental picture of something Amen that may not be present sometimes and so you can't make it out and so but God will put a shadow there sometime so you can kind of get some idea what it might look like amen so if I could say it like this it verse 26 it would be like God saying I want to show you what a man and a woman should look like when they come on earth amen now he's not weak amen but he's powerful amen so the tension here is there's a big difference in a shadow and the real thing in the natural the shadow isn't the real thing because it's getting its shape from the real thing amen but in the spiritual amen it goes just in Reverse the real thing is getting this shape from the shadow in the spiritual God uses shadows to tell what the real thing will look like now we know no man have ever seen God there's the logos there amen but before the logos there was Elohim so you couldn't see him you can't see it don't need and try a in but when God amen ello him amen when he spoke that word there had to be something that could cover it and then you get some idea Amen of what God wanted but still then as a low cost is just a fire maybe just a liquify and maybe something there but there's something on the inside of that fire so it's still God all along amen but he's blowing that thought into a fire and then all of a sudden that fire he blew that likho fire down into a baby now that just confuses everyone that Elohim God a man that became logos at this liquefier and course the people wouldn't they wouldn't go with that it wasn't satisfied so God blew that liquify into a little baby and it's sure that these group of people that lost their mind because they went to worship the king at the birth they didn't wait for the King to be the key they knew it was the king all along and they went to worship Him in that amazing thing so see you need the image you need the shadows you need the types because the real thing when it comes it can be so simple you remember what the pastor said Wednesday night god help us to have simple mind because God is so great and so powerful he has to do it that way because we are really simply we're not intellectual a man I got a big word in here and I had to write it in a way that I maybe be able to spell now I probably still mess it up when I get to Amy but we're simple-minded and God is simple amen all right and so that's what God does jesus said in Saint John 531 if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true so even standing there looking at Jesus said don't look at me in that something oh my I want to move from that there is another that bears witness of me and I know that the witness would she witness of me is true you said John he bad witness to the truth so they could receive John he said but I received not the testimony from man this st. John five and 34 but these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the father has given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me now he's moving it from John he's moving it from himself and now he's pushed it all into works but it's God I'm alone it's still guarding and lo Goss is still God to Pillar fire still God and a baby now God is talking to them as a man and telling them there's John that's God's also that's my witness but John testified there's one coming that's greater than I oh my god aren't you glad you can still see him hey man so he says here Amen now watch the image coming on down have greater witness than that of John for the works a me and the father gave me then he moves on verse 37 the father himself which has sent me has borne witness of me and his quoted as saying you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape in that a mind-boggling thing Amen now now this look at this Jesus was projecting his father's voice and his shape but they couldn't possibly accept both of those at the same time now we know that's the truth that's what the problem you know is well where are you from but isn't it a comp in the Sun oh I mean we see people want to say that when God comes they want to I know his family you know how to you know in that this boy raised right among us I mean you know and and we know all the things they had to say about that birth and you know people don't say anything but they still haven't any mind you know Mary we don't know all that birth matter maybe supernatural you know how God does God is such an author he's such a great story t now you just think back when Mayer had this powerful testimony of that God was a he manuals gonna be born through her she hadn't been with Josephine we all kind of you know you know how people are they say oh yeah I believe it and they kind of don't believe it and then God makes the story more dramatic a man instead of Mary staying in town their God allowed marriage to leave town and go over to Lisbon house don't you know that made it more mysterious but it was still God right alone it made people think oh my goodness now here she goes over there to Lisbon house and they're over there out of town and Joseph over here in town looks like she should have stayed right there but you can't make people believe the word God have to make them believe it but that made it more unbelievable she's over there in another town and then not only she comes back pregnant Elizabeth's pregnant Liz was too old to be praying but she's pregnant all the same cuz God said she would have a son oh my god you just have to believe amen so here's Jesus saying here amen you've never seen his voice not seen the shape but how amazing this scene was that we had 100% of the shadow there and 100% of the real there at the same time oh how beautiful that was 100% of the shadow and 100% of the real thing 100% of Elohim 100% of logos and 100% human oh my god can you see the image do you see that that doesn't throw you off does it oh my amen amen see you know how it is when they you know they make the mirror and they make those you know we got to keep moving into this and believing it until we can see 100% his reflection through us Oh do you love him a man a man all right sold in now see uh uh the father's image is there and the Sun image is there all at the same time what a new beginning and that's why they say what manner of man what what kind of man is this I mean what not I mean even the season The Wiz what kind of man and that's what people ought to be saying what kind of person is this all these winds and storms and tornadoes can come in this city you can take a picture of the storm coming to the city but somewhere there's 100% God and 100% man that speaks to the storm and says go back and the storm turns and go back how many believe that God is still the same you can still do the same thing amen don't you worry God will have someone that believed that amen all right and so now let's move a little further so that's the challenge and that's what we're presenting you are in Christ image don't worry about it you know I you know for 27 years I've I've never believed in being a preacher that takes something from people I always believed in giving them something and I don't want you I don't I don't want to cuz you know if if you can't take it from people anyway if people don't want you to get it they're not they're not giving you trying to take something from people if they want to hold on to that spirit they'll hold right to it how many know what I'm talking about yes they have to want to get rid of it amen and so I love you know our brother amen brother Keith I was talking about and I couldn't remember whether it was a lamp or vacuum cleaner amen amen that we talked about you know you have a good product you know you got a good product you know you're trying to sell it and you tell their customer why don't you just take this and take it off see if it's a good product give it to him let them take it on in the house and we were talking about you know that they're there you know they make maybe it's a lamp you're trying to sell them a lap they got the lamp it's in the lamp in the house and you know he can cut a regular light on but the salesman said no this lamp shines a little brighter and your natives flip it on they say well honey tonight we're gonna use this lamp see just get it in the house do you follow me just get to get the lamp in that give it to him don't say well my light is better than yours and then cut all your lights off and then I'll know don't do that just give them your light let them let it be in the house with them and they're sitting in the house hmm well honey I think let's cut this light on and before you know it cut that light on well gracious it is a little brighter and an old husband say no oh I'll put these lights in here cut this light on next night to sitting at dinner no the wife says honey let's cut this light on and before you know it they flipping it and fine then the husband say you know what and light is brighter that's how you do it hey man just that simple amen and so I don't believe in taking things from people I want to give them something tonight I want you to recognize that you've got a whole lot more than the devil is trying to tell you that you don't have all that God has done for us amen your fingernail could cast out a devil how many know the Bible says Jesus cast he could cast the devil out with his finger no not all this oh wrestling you know no just cast him out how many believe that Amy you do have that power you do have it all right so let's move so I want to leave with you tonight this evening that you have more than you using you just have to see the reflection amen you know the story you know in the mirror well you move out of the mirror and you stand in the mirror well I think oh that's me yeah and people still do that you know they come to church oh he was talking about so and so and so amen they love to say it was about so and so and so and they get out of the side of the mirror they forgot know that reflection was for you oh my amen amen I don't know about you but I justify a lot that's me how many can say that's me Amen when I look a man this is not talking about somebody else no that's how I look well tell me all you can't live right nobody can live right but don't know tell me my father said I can be perfect well I'm climbing on up in there then well it won't be but a few well I'll tell you what if it won't be but a few then I'm FTW I'm gonna be there hallelujah yes I will all right now so let's move a little further here so now I just want to use this term here I told you this big word I might have to get three men to help me say it but you know the challenge that we're presenting it with is a men that sometimes people don't know their origin they don't know where they come from and you can't hardly get nowhere if you don't know where you come from you don't know how to act when you don't know who your father is you act different you act like everybody else you you don't want to be acting like other people because they fathers could be slaves amen I told my son I 20 my son is 21 they just got married and I told him I said son don't walk out of here and forget who you are you will never be nobody else but who God made you you are the word amen so but they got this thing called uh it's the acronym is DNA so we all know what DNA is amen uh-uh deoxyribonucleic acid I told you I've just spoken to him didn't I I just might as well just spoke that is another li but it's dioxyde I bow nuclei acid what anyway is DNA and so they got this term a DNA where they can trace your origin all the way back and find out who you are a man with these tests a man that the studies are showing that there's about 99% accuracy then they can trace something get a little piece of your hair a little skin a little hair a little your blood sample a mint and they can trace you back and find out where you came from and I like that and I think tonight just as we just finish up a man I think we need to see our origin would you like that would you like to know you got to pay for the other one but this one is free amen amen all right Amen just a little test here the Word of God often refers to itself as a seat how many know the Bible calls itself a seed amen on that word see actually in a Greek is sperma which is the same word and it's gold type of keys here but it's the same word for sperm but in that sperm is everything about your daddy everything amen and so we need to check the seed because in that seed is the genetic makeup everything you're gonna do all of your you know your own things that you're gonna do everything that that you're walking into is gonna be based on the seed now you can't get blood from a turnip you can't get apples from oranges how many know what I'm talking about if it's an orange see all when it popped up is gonna be orange don't be surprised when you see it Amen it's gonna be it can't be great from you can get great from raisins but you can't get a great from corn seed y'all know what I'm saying all right and so that's what we're looking at here we wanna look a look closer here amen conception cannot take place without first planting a seed and new beginnings a man must be planted with the right seed if you don't you gonna come up with the same thing amen oh that's so important right there Genesis 111 is a very important here now Genesis uljin take notes and this will be on the tape y'all go back to study Genesis 1 and 11 says God says ever cease to bring forth of its kind whose seed is in itself all right so kids it's good test for you what what come first chicken on a very good a chicken that's good that's real good that's a powerful revelation brother I see some people still puzzling we've heard that song what kumaris chicken or the egg we stood on some people but let's see what God did he spoke it and there's a little chicken going around but in that chicken he put the seed in the chicken so the chicken could hatch another chicken hallelujah whose seed is in himself God said let there be a tree and he put the life of the tree in the tree God said let there be a he made a Fish Little Fish front floating around but he put the life in the fish you can't get away from God's creation and God saw all these things that was good amen and then he spoke man whose seed is where in itself how many you see that all right st. John 1 in 12 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name not seen in that a beautiful thing now let's watch watch the scripture your God what he's did see look you're not trying to become something you know say well oh Lord I sure wish I could be a Christian oh if you can receive Jesus Christ as your Savior he gives you the power to become what you originally were when he spoke it in the beginning oh that's so powerful I'm not trying to be a Christian I have accepted the call that I am a Christian I'm not a sinner say by God you people get saved in all this God done for us and people still want to be sinners saved well come on now what one is gonna be black and white you gonna be both at the same time you won't be a zebra no be one of the other when you were a sinner you are a sinner and when you get saved you're not a sinner sinner sin Saints make mistakes but they didn't intend to do it listen David was not an adulterer he committed adultery the scriptures don't show him going around with woman after woman after woman how many know what I'm talking about seed is inside amen if you continue to say yes you need to be adulterer well brother I can't get over well that's the message from this mornin you need a breakthrough oh that devil is so powerful and Jesus is more powerful how many know what I'm talking about if we don't preach this way people a stay in the same condition but you can come out of that thing the Bible in the book of Exodus Exodus at them as they were leaving Exodus the last couple of verses in there Moses led on said their enemies that you see now you will see them no more hallelujah it doesn't mean you won't have no battles down the road but at least you all have those how many know what I'm talking about I'm not saying you won't fight nothing else but at least you ought to stop fighting what you've been fighting year after year after year getting them all in that plane and come on out people want you to explain it but you can't explain it that's what you know that's what you mess up y'all know the story people what can you explain how to give word see people want you to don't you know explain it won't do you a bit of good if you hadn't got faith and a sinner off the street won't care how I work they just all they know all I can tell you I was blind and none of y'all did anything for me but this man laid his hand on me and I can't see he didn't explain it he believed it hallelujah oh my goodness it's just all right y'all right Amen all right so now all right that's the new beginning it's the citing time for you but just in case you're doubting and I don't know if y'all but huh I'm just gonna share this Amen I want to mention some tests I won't take some hair samples some skin samples and amen if that's that everybody ready don't leave the building don't leave any men some hair samples some skin samples some folks a men are saved as long as you don't touch the hair on their skin some people save as long as you don't parking apart or you don't say Nisan they don't like Peter saying this on the pastor love it when I sing it and some people are saved until you rub them the wrong way and all of a sudden salvation go out the door I mean you know what I'm talking about that's not from the original origin amen all right amen so we're gonna check and see where who you've been with because you know you can be with two real close together people can be religious and be with the devil how many no but if you ever get close to God at all if you ever have an experience it is impossible to come out and be in the same how many no that's the truth yes I like how Jesus said he didn't say go into Jerusalem and stay there for about three days and then you received the Holy Ghost did he say that no he said go in Jerusalem and wait on what until how long so well it's been three hours no God said wait until well I think I got it now no I don't think you have it now cuz trials can come and shake you when you find out oh I didn't have what I thought we'll see you don't understand until everybody must have their own revelation of what until me that when you get up and is settled the Word of God is a man I'm convinced that it's right yes the DNA now you need to know you need to know your origin eat know where you came from so you can get back there we need to know amen all right all right so let us make man in His image in other words God is saying when I'm finished he's gonna look like me that's right when God finish they don't we won't listen we're not going to heaven or barely make it no we're gonna be marching amen how about you I'm gonna beat you no I say this just a minute you see I got a big mouth y'all forgive me amen but I just can't help it it's something down there's bigger than me inside my soul but you know I wanted to go to the Marine Corps thank God well I guess I didn't make it there God had other plans for me but you know I was training to go to the Marine Corps and had been to Parris Island three four times or two three times and the senior-most Singh's decide hey I'm getting out on clearly get cool you know y'all not you know young people get when they get senior they get cool on a man but I was good and say Amen then at that time and that last year I decided I'm going anyway this is 40 and I didn't happen it's a well gesture you don't have to go but I thought no I want to go and I got that any thought and they're gonna got that big mouth so you know they gave me the position of God on I could carry the flag amen and said hood dude and I just shouted out and I think God God gave me a position in his army then I can hold the flag hut - amen stop your crying stop talking about you can't make it a man is only a few hours in a day you don't you not up all day - Devils not fighting you all day the devil didn't fight Jesus all day he fought him for a season and if you whip him good he'll leave you alone a little while you get a little rest and shape up you come back you kind of oh I better watch I'm Ben amen and then we'll tell you why don't you steal that you say yeah well you

gonna be here be profitable is that Alright amen be effective amen what a trace what a match Amen I hope we can scrape some of that off our skin amen amen in our own image and in our likeness that's right God was a man and said another way let me show you how he would look when he would come God placed himself in a gene and you already have the father's spiritual DNA Amen God says let me show you how he will act when he comes God says he got so God gave man a shape he gave him character and he shows you how he'll look and he also showed you how God would act when he comes inside the form of human flesh don't say that was Jesus doing that no that was me that was God in man doing it that was God showing any of what you look like how many believe that all right let's move a little closer closer here and then we'll stop amen understand your DNA makeup it will help you when your child leaves the house you know it's in the genes and after the party all the money spent in it cuz you know it's a part as long as you got money all your friends will stay when you have the party amen but soon as the money gone and the last little ball of wine we got to sip it small cuz that's all gone and I came back no more you know people big turn when he can buy it but when they came by they not that be and God will allow you just like the prodigal son to have spit all check the scripture he ran out got down to almost eaten hog slaw yes can't make it in this world bias if you can't just ignore what God wants to do with you and do what you want to do God will call you how many believe that you spit all but you know at the internet that prodigal son the Bible says he came to himself you know I could at least go home to my father what was that that was that gene on the inside that was that genetic makeup that before he a man went out there he was already a sir and the deep call to the deep and it pulled it back yes traced it back it was there all along yes DNA is the carrier of our genetic makeup amen now let me go here just a little let me lighten up a minute and we can turn a corner here and we can get out of here now see now and we y'all notice I hope it ain't on nurses in yet well oh I'm gonna try you can fix this for me in Amen at conception we know it takes a father and a mother right to have a child amen amen take your father in a mother yeah take both you need a carrier and you need somebody who got life amen we each have 23 pairs of chromosomes of each pair one received from the father and one received from the mother and these 23 pairs of chromosomes are known as the DNA all right so these 23 chromosome is known as the sex chromosomes and with these other ones one is inherited from the father and one comes from the mother and just real shortly one of those chromosomes come from the mother that's an X the other chromosome comes from the father that's a Y now the mother just have all X's I think that's a good thing amen well got a lot of X's but the father has in him he has X's and Y's so the mother have all these X's in a Amy and I think God gave that to us so she can tell this man Hicks that's right she get to the next one X I'm an older woman at the well she had six exes she had five of them you know she tried to hold one of them exes back you got five exits dad you know you know she wanted a drink we all know that amen but sometimes God before you give your drain you won't you give it at last X well you know you got one at home and no he's not your he found that other eggs so there was six of them amen God give gate and then with God see now if you let God let God cross out all them things that are not supposed to be yours and God a man will give you the right one she met Jesus she never met a man like that yes all right so a man she get a man God gave him them amen and you know I'm gonna paraphrase this like this say now you give an X you know and he say well well you giving me an X you tell that person you go see Jesus and he'll tell you why y'all didn't catch that yeah the father has the Y's amen yes see it's all right so God gave Amen men or why job said why was I born some people live in this world don't know why they born they don't know why they hear they think all I'm here for is eating and drinking having a good time people just want to have a good time it won't plenty money as I said in the text early this morning people want God to give them everything they're not even concerned about what God wants oh god I want to raise I want more I want I want I want but God wants something yes all right so Amen these X's and these wise they come there amen it's hard to find Amen a good old-fashioned god-fearing mother's these days that would take her child and raise her right and correct her and give us standards it may be a proper woman bill up her self-esteem teacher amen the women need to teach the other women how to use the X that's Scripture that's right if he keeps a little hole teach them how to be a woman you're not a man you're not tough amen oh let me get off at every move alright now we're gonna move here just a minute all right so we watch a man searching amen we have to know who our Father is we have to know now let's look here because we want a Hebrew seventy one talks about male peasant how many for me with milk hesitate real quickly now just don't let the stumble you but I just want to show you in Hebrews 71 this by the Bible says this had come this man that didn't have a father now what we're gonna do oh my goodness he has no y chromosomes he has no X chromosome because he didn't have a mother and it didn't have a father how many know that's in Hebrews 71 that's right it also says he was without descent so he did dision oh Jesus how many just old y'all don't leave me now don't don't turn out we didn't dismiss yet I'm just reading going to humming - no that's in the Bible this man didn't have a father he didn't have a mother Amy and he didn't DC in oh my goodness oh god my brain is breaking amen so this man had no origin you don't be like way you came from C but you couldn't ask this man that you couldn't add some where'd he come from praise the Lord he had no origin he had no background you know people like to check your background this man didn't have a background you couldn't check who his father was who his mother laws where he descended from all mines omaha amen amen in terms of a family or nationality hat you couldn't run a background check on him he had no beginning of days so he never was a baby oh my goodness and he did not grow ups cuz he didn't have an end of life he didn't age he didn't get all he's still the same age right now this man I'm talking about huh man you believe that I know that's hard but you should say Amen when they get hard I have to say it I'm a preacher but I things are so unbelievable I have to preach them in and say it to myself and I know and then the devil said what don't you preach that but it's in the Bible how many know what I'm talking about yes there was a man that stood in front of Abraham we don't know where he came from he just came there that's my little shout trying to hold myself oh but I'm so glad that I believe that aren't you glad you believe that you realize how hard it is for a preacher to try to preach something you notice impossibly seem like it's not true but it's true there was Abraham standing in front of him amen no beginning the days no end of life he didn't hate she wasn't oh he never got old not like this I'd like to meet that man amen wouldn't you like to meet him never age everything go back and stay the same no gray and black there's one two color black or gray whatever wonder how many know what I'm talking about y'all know who I man yes amen didn't eat and didn't about says on the end of that it says he abideth a priest continually oh my god that ought to make you shout right there that means he always walk free he is always praying and he's praying right now in 2019 oh my and it calls him a priest consider how great this man was unto whom even Abraham gave a tenth of the Spoils no X's no wise he didn't have no chromosome no father no mother no background no hard no beginning no nothing but it was God it was the image of God oh my and that's the person that we must stand before a man as a clothes here I want to look at just a little closer here we go just alright and Genesis 1:26 and let us make him in our image and see and God said in verse 27 so God created man in His image in the image of God created him male and female amen he created them but God made men and we usually think of just Adam but I want to show you that Adam was just a shadow amen let's look closer at this I read to you in first Corinthians 15:45 it says and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul and the last man Adam the Bible calls him Adam so the last man is an Adam we got two atoms here I don't know how this happened God got me he tricked me but I just gotta tell you this morning or this afternoon you got two daddies oh my goodness and some people gonna have a problem with that yes seeing the first daddy Amen told a lie and that's how you learn the lie and the second man when they told him to tell a lie he would not tell a lie how many bleeding two days oh my goodness Lord I'm in trouble ha we'll get out of here

I'm going to find me there and then he got some people got plenty mothers you might as well say Amen people hop around but indeed but the words gonna find you whatever you doing wrong - we're gonna find that one little piece and out all the message God gonna pick that one piece out I'm gonna know that to be the truth yes it is all right imagery building the Christian image here alright so amen but first Corinthians 15:22 says but oh my god for as in Adam all die even so in Christ all May eat alive I'm not ashamed of my first daddy I'm not a shame he man he met on my first daddy cuz I know I got a second daddy now yes whole world came out of the first man Dean God made the next man in the whole race came out from here amen I have here the DNA test results you know men get quiet when you got the results yeah they don't want to shout now because I said well he he opened that envelope I hope I got a yellow envelope I wish I had I got an envelope in here with the test results not on fire Amen who is the father of your baby oh my goodness and you are don't leave now no the pass is here we're not closed until he says so Amen a whole Amen so now did it the first man Adam had Authority do you agree him in the second man Adam had Authority do you agree with that the first man Adam a man had dominion over the fish of the sea do you agree with that second man Adam a man cursed a tree and it died the next day Oh how many believe that raise your hand I got to see oh my god oh I'm reading the test results now y'all oh my goodness the first man Adam was given a wife the second man Adam was given a bride I mean I believe that let me see where all my goodness taking man all right the first man Adam Amen sin the second man Adam became sin I'm going to believe that say men hallelujah

sins he committed amen but the second man was punished for sins he did not commit I mean you believe amen yeah the first man the first man Adam died how many believe that that's on the record here
