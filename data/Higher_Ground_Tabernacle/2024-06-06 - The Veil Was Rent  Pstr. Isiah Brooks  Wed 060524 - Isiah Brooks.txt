this morning or this evening excuse me we appreciate you amen we're living in the last days and I can't over emphasize that but we realize by the great we're going to be reading from Ephesians 3 in 9 3 9-2 I've had a quite a busy a busy day but uh we just thank the Lord for all we we want to also remind uh the Brethren that we'll have a bible study on Friday as well and I trust that someone has been lined up to do so uh we will return on Monday as had been announced we will be traveling to uh Ontario Canada uh to celebrate our brother John Simon's retir my wife and I if I going say so here we go Ephesians 3 9- 12 and to make make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God Jesus our lord and this is the part I love in whom we have boldness and excess with confidence by the faith of him amen we start at the first verse of the third chapter if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God not on things of the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify th Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concubines and covetousness which is idolatry things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in which ye also walked sometime excuse me in in the which ye also I'm going to read Colossians 3:5 again uh just in a in a in in another way it says therefore put to death what belongs to your Earthly nature amen sexual immorality amen let us pray our gracious father God we come before you Lord is humbl as we know how and we thank you for your grace word to us forgive us of our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord oh God and we pray even so that you would count us worthy to escape all of the Wrath that is to come upon the Earth have mercy upon our souls as we call upon your name Hallelujah so Lord Jesus we come before you as humbly as we know how you know us Lord you know all about us oh God you know our today our yesterday and you know our future and father God we pray that your mercy and Grace will be upon this assembly that Vision that you brought through Malachi for and will be grateful and thankful in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated uh by the grace of God we uh have been uh just uh trying to get these thoughts together uh to to minister tonight but by the grace of God I trust that everything that I have received of the Lord uh will bless you tonight uh because the victory is in the lord it's not in me I'm just a man but I trust that the god in me uh my subject tonight is the veil was rent and you know with that being said uh we know when the veil was rent it was rent over 2,000 years ago Hallelujah and we know that when it did rent it was God who rent The Veil and so uh I'll say this by the grace of God brother brandham said that when that veil was know and I know that there was a time it would have been meant death to to to men if they would try to go beyond that Veil only the high priest could go behind the veil and that was once a year Hallelujah when the veil was rent the Lamb of God was there in plain view but they could not see him they did not recognize him uh to the Jew he was an impostor Hallelujah but for those who could see him he was their lord and savior the very Mercy Seat Hallelujah that was once in symble was now being manifested in human flesh and the world could not recognize him Hallelujah they should have seen that something was odd about this man uh because at his death a boat of lightning came and penetrated the temple veil there he hung The Mercy Seat sir in plain but it was hi hidden from them Jews because God had blinded them Hallelujah if the Jews could have seen him they would have him hallelujah what was behind the veil Hallelujah no doubt wondered what was behind it as I said only the high priest could go behind that and he could not go behind the veil any kind of way he had to be Sanctified he had to be purified by the blood he had to wear a certain garment and that garment was a Garment of Praise Hallelujah that garment had pum granates on it so that when he could go behind the veil there was no sadness there there was nothing but joy and if those bells was wasn't sounding they knew that the priest and all that PRI in going Beyond the Veil he had to tie a rope or around his waist just in case Hallelujah just in case Hallelujah his his life wasn't he wasn't the life of God and he would die because no no unclean thing could go behind the veil without God's judgment Hallelujah is that right he have come to this ageed by their Creed and dogmas they can't see him yet he came as he did with the Jews the Messiah was in plain view Hallelujah but he was hidden because God said even in this age that LE the SE would be blind understand me because even in the time when the Jews was blinded a devil Hallelujah they called him Lord amen the true seed of God has been given eyes to see Hallelujah according to the Book of Revelation the third chapter God says hallelujah that you might be able to see Hallelujah we didn't understand that but brother brandham liking it to the church getting so cold Hallelujah to the wind and the coldness would mat their eyes together Hallelujah and it took it took some IAB Hallelujah now I don't know about you but I was born in a poor situation and I've had that experience it is it is a frightening experience when you wake up in the morning and you can't open your eyes you try to open it open them it is a painful thing H y'all better hear what I'm saying and God had my my mom used to put H H castor oil or or some kind of liquid oil uh uh in on my eye and rub it until the cross would break away there is a script or a part word that is is mysterious and and and and though it be here and it's living its life according to the scripture amen but you see this word is a living word that is now on display because see when they killed Jesus Hallelujah so that you could recognize this Jesus flesh was not God that could taste death y'all better hear what I'm saying amen so we find out that in that Temple the Bible said dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily he was in the world and the world knew him not Hallelujah he was a Living Word Veil Hallelujah and when he he he he he he died Hallelujah he promised that he would return I go away Hallelujah because if I go away the father was send what to comforter and this comforter at the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah because that name is that right brother Bram said that God is imor he changes his Mass but he never changes character character of Jesus now Hallelujah he still is alive and he still lives in a people veil was rent because of his body being rent Hallelujah pierced in the side which both of them represented life and that life was promised to be given all of those who would believe Hallelujah is that right and let me say it like this the word has never lost its power hallelujah what was behind that Veil it wasn't just a man that was looking for pity hear what I'm saying in in his in his death he conquered death Hell In The Grave y'all better hear what I'm saying hallelujah in a shame in a pity but what they did not realize is that he took upon their shame and their pity Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying and the beautiful thing about this they looked upon him and they didn't recognize that he was a very lamb but this lamb did not just have the nature of a man but he had the nature of God Hallelujah and there he was able Hallelujah to forgive the sins of the whole world now we can't even fathom that billions upon billions upon billions of people hallelujah just one drop of blood was able to save the whole world saved the people in that day and the days to come it didn't stop there it went back to yesterday Hallelujah and saved all of them who died in faith what power what a powerful blood but it wasn't just the blood it was the life of the blood y'all hear what I'm saying the veiled is rent Hallelujah the sacrifice has been accepted Hallelujah and those that are in bondage can go free that's it it's not about you but the Bible says it's not by power it's not by might but it's by my spirit say the Lord hallelujah why because God became the sacrifice Hallelujah to God you love the Lord oh let me read something you know in the Old Testament to enter behind the skin was death now to stay from behind it is death glory is death see that happens of course at the renting of the veil at Calvary when the Veil was rent the old Veil now to stay out of his presence is death see it changes back and forth and you must find the scripture to see what your important Hallelujah because we can't stay in the inner Court we can't stay in the outer Court the outer court is death the court is death we've got to go all the way into the holies of holies we've got to go Beyond the Veil Hallelujah we don't have to knock on the door the grace of God see we come to show him alive Hallelujah I was thinking about the bride even though the word call us the bride we're we're like a woman with no name we don't have a denominational name hallelujah we're the word hallu that's true brother am and she is hidden in his name think about it the women in the Bible are often not known by name only special ones Hallelujah and I got that thought and I said that's right God had the devil looking in the wrong direction he was actually trying to stop the man as our brother said but you see the man seed was corrupt it could have never brought forth perfection but the devil spent all of those years trying to stop the Royal seed Hallelujah it was already written where a woman would surpass the man Hallelujah and that that that that scripture to my understanding refers to Mary she's the only woman that was able to bring forth a child without a man Hallelujah it was there God gave Victory and made the devil look stupid can I say it like that Hallelujah you don't see get Joseph to kill her to Stone her but then God intervened why would you say that why did he intervene because he said Mary that's my son this is a supernatural thing Hallelujah and that's what the what the devil don't understand that he know God would God has a a woman Hallelujah who's willing to remember he said he didn't know that he would have to go through that said he was nervous but he again called his arm called meaty I mean in the vision never called her name Hallelujah when they called William Bram they called their names Hallelujah they took the name of their husband H oh come on somebody see that's the way it always have been but we could not see that's why the Bible says whatever you do in word or deed do it all in his name is that right all the heaven and earth that is Born Again is named after him oh glory to God is that right is moving and we don't have to worry is that right because remember when Adam fell he had to give an account for his wife Hallelujah is that right so is it with Jesus hallu he's got to give account for that's why he said he justified us that's why Paul said my life is hid in Christ Hallelujah is that right Paul said I don't want to know nothing the blood came back or the life of the blood on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah and he still lives because the Holy Ghost is still being given out Hallelujah when the Hallelujah Ephesians 3 15-21 Hallelujah is that right it's the true even when God tolds Abraham I'm going to visit you according to the years or the time of con he came to Sarah yall understand me he byass Abraham and and impregnated Sarah you understand what I mean now God didn't impregnate Sarah yet he did but he used Abraham's seed y'all understand me he made her womb ready he gave her body strength see he did all of that and that was a shadow and a type of today Hallelujah when God found us we were like Sarah Hallelujah we couldn't believe it could be true Hallelujah but as we move forward God is giving us strength God has giv us Faith Hallelujah because this seed can only be received if the faith of God is in you Hallelujah the thing that you believe there impire possible God has to bring you to a place where you can see it's it's possible and I am the one that God has chosen to bring forth the promised seed Hallelujah uh Ephesians 3:15 of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that this why we name this that he would Grant you you hear that Grant you grant me according to what the riches of his what Glory what is his glory but his holy spirit to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the enemy hallelujah how he did Sarah he must do us hallelujah that's exactly right that Christ May dwell in your hearts by fath PR amen that ye being rooted and grounded in love Hallelujah may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height Hallelujah it said that we may be able to comprehend that means it's not incomprehensible it mean that you can't Hallelujah we can't explain it can anybody explain love but you know when you got it Hallelujah comprehend with All Saints what is the bread the length the depth and the height and to know not Wonder at it to know the love of Christ which passes now that he might be filled with all the fullness of God hallelujah that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God hallelujah I don't know about you but I want to be filled with all the fullness of God hallelujah I wanted to to go above exceedingly above hallelujah what my mind think amen that's what the prophet God said uh today Hallelujah in the unveiling of God he said we're just humans We're Men we can only comprehend like flesh Hallelujah it takes God to take us beyond that we can't do it on our own but God said this is where I want to take you because of Veil is rent I want you know I want you to know me like Paul says not only just in my suffering but I want to know him in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah because his veil was rent he had to die he had to suffer you see how Priceless this message become when you realize how oh my God how Jesus had to suffer for it Hallelujah he shed his blood for you he shed his blood for me Hallelujah is that right and the Bible said the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the glory in which the father has in store for us hallelujah glory to God let's move on now unto him that is able to exceedingly abundantly above all all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh where in us the power must be in you let's read that again now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US and that word worketh with the e mean to continue to work Hallelujah it never stops Hallelujah that's why we move from glory to Glory Hallelujah unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World A World Without End and Let the church say amen hallelujah Ephesians 3 n we read that already okay Colossians 3 1-7 you love the Lord amen you are as soon as you attach your name to something outside of the word you get in trouble see the deed of the nians was not only controlling the people but they were adding to the word and they made the people believe that their word word was just as authentic as Paul's word hallelujah and when they believe the nic's word over the over the prophet Paul word it brought death to them y'all hear what I'm saying and we find out that we have done the same thing many people have done the same thing Hallelujah even the prophet of God says whatever I say take it back to the Y thr Hallelujah and I won't get into some issues but I'll say many people amen have used the prophet's Life as a tradition Hallelujah and they have styled that tradition in so much it makes the word of God of none effect Colossians 3 1-7 see when when you say things like that it make people nervous but you need to read your Bible you need to read your Bible and and understand that everything brother Brandon preach is in there somewhere Hallelujah is that true they thought one time that the Thunders and the seals weren't in there and brother brand say is in there he said from Genesis all the way in Shadow and type is in there amen God can't tell you not to add and then he adds hallelujah it's in there wo Mercy Lord Colossians beginning at the first verse I mean the third chapter first verse if ye then be risen with Christ see those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth Hallelujah for ye are dead your and your life is hid with Christ in God hallelujah now I don't know about you but that that says a lot to me Hallelujah because we have flesh we have to be careful the flesh is lusted against the spirit it it's always against the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will say pray and your flesh will say sleep Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will say fast and your flesh will say eat it is always a battle every day is a battle but Paul said it's our duty to kill the man every day crucify the flesh every day when you crucify him that means he pinned down he can't move yes for when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory is that right I know I read that already but we need to we need to understand that our affections got to change God help us and the only way it will change is that we truly have a nature change is that right cuz cuz the dub don't hang out with the Buzzard oh my God help us now is that right amen the Bible said you can't have bitter water and sweet water coming from the same Fountain Hallelujah in other words something's wrong with that Hallelujah like I try to tell people amen when we came into this world we had the nature of Wrath the nature of the children of Wrath Hallelujah but the Bible said the soul that sinth it should surely die so that part of you must die and rock that God the seed of God may live Hallelujah it people say well we got dual natures and we will always have dual Natures you will always have your flesh but that's do mean that your nature and your flesh is connected when God comes in there it's his nature Hallelujah that is governing your your your flesh because the flesh doesn't forget because the spirit won't allow it to forget y'all better hear what I'm saying so God comes along and he gives you a new spirit and then he puts the Holy Ghost in that spirit and brother bam said when he gives you a new spirit that new spirit is given to you to be able to cope with the word hallelujah but that's not the end of it the nature must change Hallelujah no evil natured person is going to heaven Hallelujah you so what do you mean brother Brooks that's where the foolish virgins messed up even though they had the Holy Ghost they did they had a portion but they didn't take it to be Beyond the Veil cuz when you go Beyond the Veil all of it your nature everything everything dies back there and God Lives Colossians sorry Corinthians please two Hallelujah you love the Lord we try to hurry by God's grace and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellence of speech of wisdom declaring unto you the test of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified why is it that Paul said I don't want to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified and many of us want to know so much we want to know how the moon was shaped you know how many stars there is in the Galaxy I mean it's it's amazing how we do things that we feel is necessary and we learn all of the deep things of God and we fail to come to know Jesus Christ and him crucified Hallelujah we can't we fail to come and see the very the very thing he died for was to make us come to know him it was about fellowshipping with him Hallelujah and we have put churches we placed preachers uh uh different folks in in that place but God didn't come for us to come just to know everybody we come to know him we want to know him the man that died for you the one who R the veil the one who gave his life for you this is what we come to know what good will it do if we learn all the Creeds all the dogmas all the orders of the church and still don't know the man who was crucified for [Music] you how can you marry how can he marry someone that doesn't know him Hallelujah you said well I know how I been those I've seen God heal I've seen God deliver I've seen God raise the dead Lord I've done all these things in your name and Jesus said depart from me ye workers of iniquity for I don't know you see it's the in intimacy that God is looking for it's that uniting that he's looking for that invisible Union with you is what he's looking for Hallelujah is that right brother brandom said like this he said he could have had a wife he could have had children Hallelujah but the Bible said he Sanctified himself is that right and because he Sanctified himself he said ye are Sanctified because I'm Sanctified you are Sanctified in other words you're not going to choose nobody but Jesus Hallelujah the word will be your husband and only the word Hallelujah y understand what I'm saying I did not come in this Dimension to become to become rich or to become famous or to become a great preacher I came in this world so that the world may see that Jesus Christ lives Hallelujah in me and that's why you come you've come to show the devil that he's still defeated Hallelujah he will always be defeated Hallelujah because Jesus lives in us hallelujah I'm determined to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling what are you talking about Paul said I went through all those emotions because you go through those those emotions don't mean you don't have him Hallelujah your spirit will will send you through those things but it it it it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't dictate what's going on in the soul see that that inner man will will defeat all of that Hallelujah yes he said I came in weakness anybody know what I'm talking about he said I was in fear and when you in such fear you're trembling Hallelujah and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man wisdom and basically saying listen I come but I know I must I I I go through all of this because I know that the words that I must preach to you will also be judged I fear I tremble I'm weak and while I'm weak he's strong and I don't want to put on a show for you it ain't about Hollywood or the theater or no no no no no this this this is about God and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and power y y'all see what I'm saying so the difference between Paul he had something in him even the devil's recognized Hallelujah so when the devil recognize you it's the Christ that he sees in you Hallelujah you're not like the sons of ska tried to put on the show The Power and a lot of people put so much trust in a preacher to that because they've seen the supernatural demonstrated in those preachers oh God his with them well God was with Judas too cuz Judas cast out devils and Judas was a preacher Hallelujah but brother Bram said he failed to go and get the Holy Ghost he missed Pentecost y'all hear what I'm saying see I don't care I look at people's character that's what I look for I don't care how great they preach I don't care if they've got thousands of people around them it means nothing to me because you know what I believe the more you stay with the truth the smaller your group going to be Hallelujah truth does not it does not bring in a flu situation of a lot of folks it didn't do it it didn't do it in Jesus ministry when he lived in the flesh it didn't do it in Paul's Ministry Hallelujah and look at what happened in William Brandon's Ministry all of those people that was healed and delivered majority of them turn their backs on the message Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying and now we're just a little flock how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect sixth verse and that word perfect mean mature yet not with the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that that comes to not but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory Hallelujah what are you saying your inheritance as the brother said is the glory of God and this Glory was ordained by God you can't miss it Hallelujah his word will not come back void Hallelujah that's why the Bible said fear not little flock it is a father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom if you trust this message if you believe the word believe that God is going to fulfill your heart's desire Hallelujah if you want to be perfect God will make you perfect if you need Deliverance God will deliver you Hallelujah if you need healing God will heal you halelujah he promised it why because all of this is for His Glory Hallelujah which not listen but we speak wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world to our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory Hallelujah all Satan's Lucifer Satan I don't know how you want to call him the devil the he spent so many hundreds of years trying to stop the Royal seed and God put it in such a way he couldn't believe it this cannot be the Messiah see even the devil knew the word by the letter but the letter kill it Hallelujah he had no Spirit to understand it matter fact if we go by the way brother brandom dramatized it Satan thought he still was the winner until Jesus got into the region of the lost the devil really thought he had him when Jesus arrived in the hell the devil say I got you now oh my God he had no idea hallelujah what Jesus was was a uh uh how could I say it what he he was built of he he he was the word he was a word he could have whipped The Devil in a minute's time but he couldn't even be released from hell until his three days was up God had an appointed time you you can't tell me that Satan was wasn't glad he left you better hear what I'm saying that was one visitor that was able to come out of Satan's hell he couldn't keep him he couldn't keep his Spirit there and he couldn't keep his body there though his body was dead God had already spoken I am the resurrection I am the light Hallelujah is that right and that same Holy Ghost the Bible says if that same Spirit be in you that was in Christ Jesus as it quickened his body it shall also Quicken your body y'all better hear what I'm saying so because the veil was rent and the blood was shed No Grave can hold my body down Hallelujah I don't care if I rock hallelujah in the grave when he call your name you will get up and no devil in hell can stop it Hallelujah absolutely and then he gave us a sweet taste of Victory don't worry little flock I saw you behind the curtain of time I saw your theophany and so I know that to be true because Ned mcken was in my church Ned mcken brother Ned mcken and he knew brother brandham and Ned mcken lived with us I was his Pastor until he died Hallelujah and brother bradam told me Ned mckenny when he went behind the curtain of time he said I saw you there Hallelujah is that right he told sister brown brown I saw you walking on the streets of gold sister Brown still lives but her theophany is over there y'all hear what I'm saying the suffering of this world cannot be prepare to the glory in which God has in store for us oh oh Lord I do so many wrong things but God knew it let me tell you something the blood prevails Hallelujah God when he saved you he saw every mistake you was going to make and he still saved you Hallelujah is that right I'm so glad the Holy Ghost is not based on feelings Hallelujah cuz sometimes I feel like he ain't there y'all better hear me but my faith kicks in because he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you and I remember when he I remember when he came in huh to God yes sir oh my why because the veil was rent because the blood was shed because the real Lamb of God showed up Hallelujah Woo is that all right let me move on for which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory but as it is written I have not seen ear ha not I'm see but it's written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which have which God had prepared for them that loved love him Hallelujah but this the 10th verse says but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah just give me a little bit a little bit more time I'm almost done I'm almost done hallelujah these things are freely given to the bride is that right Rebecca never asked Isaac for nothing she didn't even know him but he sent her gifts before she knew him Hallelujah and that's what God has done he's he was blessing us before we came to know him and if he blessed us before we knew him what will it be like when you come to know [Applause] him Hallelujah and he said ask whatever you will I can do whatever you want I can go beyond whatever you think you ask or think I can do exceedingly abund above don't limit me I'm God he says hallelujah don't limit me don't limit the Lord Satan cannot be more powerful than God God is the devil's Creator y'all understand me he created all things and the creature cannot be greater than the Creator don't ever let Satan make you feel feel powerless when God said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me is that right and brother brandham said it like this all that was in Christ he poured it into his church Hallelujah why because all that was in God God poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ God poured it into the church Hallelujah that means god Chang his mask Hallelujah God IM Mor became us hallelujah glory to God that's why I love that name Jesus cuz it sounds like he's us hallelujah love my God I'm almost done coming from the message the unveiling of God you got to recognize God is in you you are the temple of God it's not by power it's not by might but by my spirit you know we put too much of us into it that's why we feel like failures we put too much of us into it it ain't got nothing to do with you it's all about God hallelujah is that right Rahab didn't know nothing about God only what she had heard but God in his mind knew exactly who Rahab was Hallelujah before Rahab married Salon God had already paired him up y'all hear what I'm saying and God knew what The Offspring was going to be y'all hear what I'm saying God is always in control when things look like it's out of control don't you worry Hallelujah and when the storms are raging that doesn't mean the sun is not shining because the storms only last for a while y'all know what I'm saying it is what it is God has shown us that so many times and we drop our head sometime in shame Hallelujah but one thing for certain God would have never chosen you if he knew you would give up the bride don't give up the bride doesn't give up she may fall she may falter she may even stray away but but she never forgets she knows like I heard the prophet of God say when Jesus ask Peter them where else can you go see once you make Jes Jesus once you really meet him nothing nothing else is appealing tell me after knowing this message what denomination you can go to what organization there's nothing so we have the same thing that's how you know you've met him see we want this thing to be so Grand but it's so simple because once you meet this message meet this word you can't go nowhere else nothing else will satisfy you and Peter said Lord where else can we go you have the words to eternal life huh and we know that to be the truth oh my God I feel so good tonight the unveiling of God 1964 I'm closing on this paragraph 281 hallelujah hallelujah God we we so busy looking at all of these little fail and all these tests and we don't even know God testing us because he loves us hallelujah who the devil it ain't the devil God said so God allows it I've had so much trouble you know and and it doesn't mean you don't get a little anxious sometimes that's why the Bible said be anxious for nothing is that right Hallelujah but it's something here that gives you a peace even when you know you're wrong I had a friend when I was young I don't think it's he is is his grandparents I don't think he ever got a whiping but he always got me in trouble he didn't have to worry about it cuz he knew he wasn't going to get in Whi it no matter how bad he was y'all understand what I'm saying he had a peace that his grandparents loved him Beyond his failures and you better know that God loves you beyond your failures he conquered every everything for you now let's get to the quote like he was in Moses when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh see only thing he don't done was change his mask not his word not his nature he is the same yesterday today and forever he only changes his his form he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David from David to Joseph on down till he come into the fullness of the godhead Bing hallelujah it's still the same God amen amen I hope that that you get through see it is the same God but he just takes on another Veil see he puts on another Veil and let me let me say it like this don't ever think because you don't act like somebody else that God is not in you God makes music with you and every instrument doesn't sound the same but when you put it all together is that right they said that even the a even the Stars sings they make notes and every every Star has a different pit but God knows exactly what the chorus is he knows exactly what the song is y'all hear what I'm saying and and sometimes you got to have a little mourning in there Hallelujah you can't be happy all the time you got to have a little sadness in there in order this to display Victory you said brother books explain that to me Israel was God's people but God had to put them through slavery to get a certain sound y'all understand me he knew them he saw them and when it came to the place where he the music seat was about to change he said I'm come down God came down and he changed the music the Sheep what did he do he sent a prophet Hallelujah he turned their mourning into Joy is that right he he he he he he brought a lamb he showed them what they were going he was going to do in type in Shadow but when they left Egypt for the for the first time when they were leaving Egypt there was nobody was looking back huh it was only when they got into the to the Red Sea when they saw obstacles coming they then began to think about Egypt it wasn't that they weren't afraid to suffer they just didn't want to die they knew what suffering was they didn't they didn't want to die and this was God all along oh my God God will bring you into the face of death and what you going to do Lord why you brought me here how can I get out of this and God say stand still and see the salvation of the Lord huh God always make a way of Escape always make a way of Escape Hallelujah you know even God loves the feebleminded is that the truth amen and all of us get a little fever mind all of us but God loves us it is still the same God Amen I hope that it gets through see it is the same God but he just takes on another Veil see he puts on another Veil he did it in the reformers taken on a veil taken on a veil until finally it comes down through the Lutheran age down through the a other age then finally it comes out into the complete just before it comes a prophet arise again now listen what he says just before it comes a prophet arise Hallelujah so the the prophet is not the the ending point it's just before like John just before Jesus the word just before the scene changes did the did the scene change the scene must change hallelujah oh my God just before it comes a prophet arise again what it does it foreshadows the word showing back here revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church will be without not without understanding then when this Fades out then like John said I must decrease he must increase then all and all comes into him he is fully manifested through Luther Wesley Pentecostal age and on down on down and he is fully manifested you see come down just the manifestation God unfolding see him notice fulfilled in his promises for this day as they had so my my point is there is a fulfillment of God in Christ or or God in you Hallelujah it it doesn't stop with Elijah y'all understand what I'm trying I'm not taking away I'm saying there's another stage Hallelujah but we can't go with Joshua Ministry without knowled in Moses Ministry y'all understand what I'm saying cuz that's what God Said Joshua was not a prophet Joshua was a soldier you know he was a warrior glory to God the bride of Christ believe it or not you a warrior the Bible said put on the whole arm of God you're not putting on the arm of God and not having a Warfare but the Bible said our Warfare is not not not carnal but it's spiritual we're here to pull down the strongholds Hallelujah we are here to defeat the Devil in his own Eden Hallelujah is that right we're here to defeat him like Jesus did when he went to hell he defeated Satan on his own territory and we are here to defeat Satan on his own territory Satan is trying to tell us that we're not going to be translated we're not worthy to be changed Hallelujah but what he doesn't know and that the change is already started Hallelujah and we're moving from glory to glory not by power not by might but by his Spirit say the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh my see and when Jesus came he was a word in its fullness because the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah see they were only part of the word pointing to it see now notice keep your thoughts here here it comes as I say see the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it Hallelujah therefore after him the fullness we cannot point to something else it points back to him the word this is the complete Revelation nothing can be added or taken away from it there is the complete re Revelation all that sh of him to come but when he comes he was the perfect Hebrews 1 says God in son times spoke to the fathers through the prophets God spoke through veils the prophet but in the last day through his son Jesus Christ there you are unveiled out there on Calvary the Son of God unveil what was brother brandham saying that this word was being preached through his lips by Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah and let me tell you like this every preacher must have the G same Jesus Christ on the inside preaching through his lips Hallelujah glory to God notice Made Alive and today when the word is manifested in human vessels veils is absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to God being baptized of him according to First Corinthians 12 we become identified with him amen so in closing we must keep in mind Who We Are and we must fight to maintain that's what Jesus said the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind Hallelujah but this message came to give us our identity Hallelujah we came from God and we go back to God is that the scripture God didn't hide nothing from you he only is himself from the wise and The Prudent think about how blessed you are that millions of people billions maybe desire to have what you have you didn't bring yourself you didn't choose it yourself it was God choosing and you trying to tell me that God chose you to lose you no no no no I do believe though that if you are the bride of Christ you going to keep fighting fighting and battling until you see Jesus Christ Living in you him only you love the Lord I believe that we're on the break of something new and when I say that that don't mean that the word is new but God is getting ready to unfold see you you you could say I I know him but if it's letter you don't know him you can only know him by the spirit you hear what I'm saying if you don't have the Holy Ghost you just think you know him the Holy Ghost brings you to the knowledge of who he is and who you are and your relationship with him it really becomes a great love affair yeah he it's no longer a lord I got to do this and I got to do that no I love you so much I'm going oh I'm just excited you don't even think about it amen that's the way God wants us to be if he said run in the fire you run in the fire Hallelujah if the lions are roaring and ready to eat he said run there run through there you'll do it cuz you love him and you know it's just for a short moment and you'll be in his presence you don't fear nothing Satan brings he'll bring it but perfect love cast out that fear living Below in this old sinful world Comfort can [Music] aford striving alone to face Temptation s where could I go to the [Music] Lord oh where could I go oh where could I go
