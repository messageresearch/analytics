[39:55] i want to give honor to our lord and
[39:57] savior
[39:59] thank god for his goodness and his mercy
[40:02] thank him for allowing us to be here
[40:06] tonight amen safe and sound
[40:11] you know and he's kept us
[40:15] in this time of the corona and i know
[40:17] he's going to continue
[40:19] to keep us it's nothing of our goodness
[40:22] but it's just the mercy and grace of god
[40:26] i heard and had a brother
[40:30] basically
[40:33] of course text me and from south africa
[40:36] telling me about the pastors
[40:38] and all that have died there under this
[40:40] corona
[40:42] and here in one place not only that the
[40:46] father died but the son as well
[40:49] it's it's terrible there and yet we sit
[40:52] here and we
[40:54] fail to see the mercies and the grace of
[40:56] god
[40:58] almost every church i know of has been
[41:01] hit in terrible ways people dying and
[41:05] yet god has kept this little fellowship
[41:10] i'm not saying the devil don't come try
[41:11] us but you know
[41:13] when goliath comes david does too
[41:17] yeah so we thank god for the victory
[41:20] that we have seen
[41:22] uh in in this fellowship never forget
[41:25] people
[41:26] it's not because you've been so good
[41:28] it's just the mercy and the grace of god
[41:31] that the lord has kept us in this day
[41:34] and time and so
[41:36] as we stand we're just going to go right
[41:38] into the word of god we're so
[41:39] glad to see our brother mike we i think
[41:42] i text you
[41:45] i know i did i can't remember when the
[41:47] last i did
[41:49] but anyway glad to see you we missed you
[41:51] around here man
[41:52] we really missed you and so good good
[41:55] good good to see you
[41:59] some things that we are now facing
[42:03] and uh i think a lot of times we
[42:05] overlook
[42:06] some of the smaller things that goes on
[42:08] in our life
[42:10] and we understand one thing
[42:13] that those who make a rapture will be
[42:16] those who
[42:17] have conquered self
[42:21] and now they possess divine love because
[42:24] remember your greatest enemy is not the
[42:26] devil
[42:28] your greatest enemy is you
[42:31] but we're going to read from first
[42:32] corinthians the 12th chapter
[42:34] from there we'll go to romans the 8th
[42:37] and then of course to that famous
[42:39] scripture
[42:40] that we all are familiar with first
[42:42] corinthians 13.
[42:44] we'll try our best to keep it short but
[42:46] you know when it comes to
[42:49] uh we see the world falling apart i i
[42:52] listen to the message falling apart and
[42:54] birth pains and things of that nature
[42:57] the prophet of god is just
[42:59] literally laying it out as though he was
[43:02] here and
[43:03] you know one of the things that really
[43:04] caught my attention was that he said had
[43:07] he not known
[43:09] what the scriptures were foretelling
[43:12] of this age he said it would have been
[43:16] a strange thing and he said in this age
[43:19] love will be a strange
[43:23] thing because we're
[43:26] living right now in a time where people
[43:30] hate each other there's no middle ground
[43:34] they hate each other and don't even know
[43:36] why they hate each other
[43:38] but the bible says in the last days
[43:42] the kingdoms will be against kingdom and
[43:45] family against family and you know
[43:48] we're seeing it right now
[43:51] unfolding in our eyes i heard a man
[43:54] saying i'll let you sit down in just a
[43:55] moment
[43:56] i was looking to youtube and there was a
[43:59] a
[44:00] conversation going on i can't remember
[44:02] the name man's name
[44:03] but one fellow he called jonathan kahn
[44:07] he called jonathan khan a doomsday
[44:10] prophet
[44:11] and said well i don't even believe any
[44:13] of it
[44:16] and the other guy says well you know i
[44:17] don't believe it either
[44:20] and uh so if you know if they don't
[44:22] believe their own profit they're not
[44:23] going to believe
[44:24] ours but the point is i remember a
[44:27] little story when i was
[44:28] a little boy reading in in elementary
[44:31] and
[44:32] it was the little boy that cried woof
[44:36] and he would cry wolf and have all of
[44:39] these
[44:40] villagers come out with their hoes and
[44:41] their rakes and
[44:43] and everything and then they find out
[44:44] that the wolf wasn't there
[44:47] but one day the wolf showed up and when
[44:50] the boy was crying out for help
[44:52] nobody in the village would go to help
[44:55] him because they thought it was another
[44:56] prank
[44:58] it worked against him
[45:02] but the wolf did show up
[45:05] and like i tried to tell people i said
[45:07] you can say whatever you want to say
[45:10] you don't have to believe it but that's
[45:11] not going to stop
[45:13] what's coming our way and so i want to
[45:16] preach
[45:16] a little message tonight on love simple
[45:20] but powerful first corinthians 12
[45:25] 12-13 for as the body is
[45:28] one and have many members
[45:31] and all the members of that one body
[45:33] being
[45:34] many are one body
[45:37] so also is christ for by one spirit are
[45:41] we
[45:41] all baptized into one body whether we be
[45:44] jews or gentiles
[45:46] whether we be born or free and haven't
[45:49] been all made to drink
[45:52] into one spirit oh i love that romans 8
[45:55] 26
[45:58] it says likewise the spirit also helpeth
[46:00] our infirmities
[46:02] for we know not what we should pray for
[46:05] as we ought
[46:06] but the spirit itself make it into
[46:08] session for us with groanings which
[46:11] cannot be uttered
[46:13] and he that searches the heart knoweth
[46:15] what is in the mind of the spirit
[46:18] because he maketh intercession for the
[46:20] saints according to the will of god
[46:23] and we know that all things work
[46:25] together for the good to them that love
[46:27] god
[46:28] to them that who are the called
[46:30] according to his purpose
[46:33] for whom he did for know he also did
[46:35] predestinate
[46:37] to be conformed to the image of his son
[46:40] that he might be
[46:41] the firstborn among many brethren
[46:44] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[46:47] he
[46:47] also called and him whom he called
[46:51] them he also justified and whom he
[46:54] justified
[46:55] them he also glorified
[46:59] what shall we say to these things
[47:02] if god be for us who can be
[47:06] against us let us pray father god we
[47:10] come before you lord we thank you for
[47:11] your amazing grace
[47:13] we thank you for being so good to us and
[47:14] we pray lord god tonight
[47:17] that you would have free course lord
[47:19] don't let
[47:20] this service uh be one that is common
[47:24] but i pray that somehow the word oh god
[47:27] uh prick the hearts
[47:29] stir up the hearts whether i speak in a
[47:32] calm voice or
[47:33] whether or not i shout doesn't change
[47:36] the word
[47:37] the word is powerful of itself
[47:41] and i pray lord god tonight that you
[47:43] would help each and every one of us see
[47:46] the day and time that we're living in
[47:48] and father i pray that you will set
[47:50] all of our hearts on fire that after
[47:53] this service
[47:54] oh god we'll set our face like a flint
[47:57] we'll move forward oh god that we may be
[48:00] anointed
[48:01] with the anointing of this hour that the
[48:04] message will be on display
[48:06] we ask these things in your lovely name
[48:08] jesus christ we pray
[48:10] amen you may be seated and like i said i
[48:13] try my best not to be long but i
[48:15] i want to just throw out a few things
[48:17] because you know a lot of times people
[48:19] come to the church and
[48:21] we all are guilty sometimes they miss
[48:23] and we don't know where they are and
[48:25] some of us don't even care where they
[48:26] are and i'm not throwing off on anybody
[48:28] but you know we we're too into ourselves
[48:32] the body is something that must work
[48:34] together
[48:35] and everybody's sickness failures
[48:38] uh whatever the case may be the body
[48:41] should be able to
[48:42] feel the feelings of each
[48:46] infirmities and so i was thinking about
[48:49] that because
[48:50] what made me uh go this way is because
[48:53] our sister
[48:55] uh um diamond
[48:58] uh was very sick and um
[49:02] was going about two months and and of
[49:04] course my business i
[49:06] missed her but yet and still didn't miss
[49:08] her enough
[49:10] naomi she gave me the word but we know
[49:13] it's more yo
[49:14] amen but nevertheless we we we
[49:17] we fail to see and and truth of the
[49:20] matter is if we don't
[49:21] unite together and and be one body then
[49:24] what where is this love because we're
[49:27] not talking about affiliate love
[49:29] we're talking about agape love and when
[49:32] god gives a person
[49:33] whether it be male or female agape love
[49:36] it it's not not something you've got to
[49:38] work
[49:38] at it's something that is
[49:42] now hearing the message divine love and
[49:44] sovereign grace
[49:46] brother brown said when divine love has
[49:48] been projected
[49:50] and come to his end is destination
[49:55] sovereign grace will then take over
[49:59] now you say well what does that mean to
[50:01] me what does it mean to us
[50:03] remember when the word of god came to
[50:05] the prophet and says
[50:07] because you have chosen the narrow way
[50:13] this is the victory of love divine
[50:17] so you say what do you mean it is the
[50:19] harder way
[50:21] it is a way that god has ordained for us
[50:24] to travel
[50:26] i was telling brother troy i said i
[50:28] think it was troy and
[50:30] and brother i said now i realize
[50:33] what god was saying when he said fear
[50:35] not little flock
[50:38] because the world is so in in such a
[50:41] chaotic
[50:42] state you don't know what's going to
[50:44] happen tomorrow
[50:46] a lot of people don't want to believe
[50:48] like uh i heard the man say well i don't
[50:50] believe they've been preaching
[50:51] doomsday uh as long as i know but
[50:55] that doesn't say nothing
[50:58] noah preached 120 years doomsday and it
[51:01] came
[51:02] i mean it's evident it showed up it
[51:05] showed up at a time when people
[51:07] least expected it and that's the way god
[51:10] always worked
[51:11] right amen so you got to understand that
[51:14] we're living in a time where
[51:16] the hatred
[51:19] right the power of hatred and the power
[51:23] of
[51:23] love has met together darkness and light
[51:27] and you and i have got to be the light
[51:29] let me tell you something you cannot
[51:31] love
[51:32] people with the filial love that
[51:35] this this trial will go beyond that
[51:39] and so you and i must understand amen
[51:42] somehow we better get with god
[51:45] only divine love makes a rapture
[51:49] hello being a church member doesn't do
[51:52] it
[51:52] being born around the message or knowing
[51:55] all the quotes and
[51:56] knowing all the places the prophet went
[51:58] does not guarantee you a rapture
[52:01] you and i must come into divine love and
[52:03] understand
[52:04] it is a birth hello
[52:07] it ain't something that's just gonna
[52:09] drop on you lord just give me divine
[52:11] love
[52:12] you gotta work you gotta die amen
[52:15] have you ever seen an animal hit by a
[52:17] car
[52:19] and that animal is jumping everywhere
[52:21] and he's just squirming what is he doing
[52:22] he's fighting for life he doesn't want
[52:25] to die
[52:26] he's fighting for life and that's the
[52:29] kind of thing we must understand
[52:32] we must fight for life now
[52:35] we look at this and you say well what do
[52:36] you mean love is the conquering force
[52:39] there is nothing that can conquer
[52:42] divine love absolutely nothing no demons
[52:46] no no devils nothing hell can present
[52:50] can lit can can jesus showed us that
[52:53] you know jesus himself went down into
[52:56] the lower region
[52:57] and he fought the devil on his own
[53:00] grounds
[53:01] hallelujah he said well i ain't got to
[53:03] forgive yes you do
[53:05] if you're going to make heaven you got
[53:07] to forgive well i i don't know man they
[53:10] don't
[53:10] did me wrong every time i see where the
[53:13] devil tried to justify a sin
[53:16] i said oh my god you and i have no idea
[53:19] the kind of love it took for jesus
[53:23] to conquer the devil huh
[53:26] he conquered satan in a way that none of
[53:29] us could have done it
[53:31] think about the beatings and the the
[53:33] speeding and you know
[53:35] you can't even step on some people's
[53:36] toes without them getting an attitude
[53:39] but see that ain't god and that has to
[53:43] die
[53:45] right this may sound like a simple
[53:46] message but it really is
[53:51] we must have love the prophet god said
[53:55] if i had
[53:56] uh uh uh if i had
[54:00] the opportunity to have any gift
[54:05] he said lord take all the gifts and let
[54:09] me have
[54:10] love for no matter how many gifts we got
[54:14] they will never do us any good
[54:17] except the love of god is the motivating
[54:22] motive behind the gift he said we
[54:25] must have love
[54:29] that all right understand we're one body
[54:33] we're supposed to take care of each
[54:34] other right
[54:36] oh it's the truth you know you're
[54:38] supposed to be what's mine and mine's
[54:40] supposed to be with your what's yours
[54:42] you say ain't no way well that's how the
[54:44] church started out
[54:45] they saw everything that everybody would
[54:49] have
[54:49] things in common nowadays
[54:53] it ain't so and i don't think we'll ever
[54:55] come to that but the
[54:57] nevertheless that's the way it started
[55:00] out
[55:01] you know i can remember when i was a
[55:02] little boy the neighbors were
[55:05] like brothers and sisters when my mama
[55:07] prepared food everybody was welcome
[55:10] nowadays you gotta be invited
[55:13] and don't come and stand on the porch
[55:15] like you're hungry like you're gonna
[55:17] uh-uh
[55:17] it ain't happening that's the way it is
[55:20] now i don't know and i can't say that's
[55:22] with everybody but when it comes to this
[55:24] church and this is what i've been really
[55:26] praying i've been
[55:27] praying and fasting i was been somewhat
[55:30] weak today because of it
[55:32] and yeah so anyway
[55:35] uh just for us not just for brother
[55:38] brooks for us
[55:40] that god would would literally give us a
[55:42] revelation
[55:44] of what this divine love is not just
[55:46] give us a revelation
[55:48] of it but feel us with it like the
[55:51] scripture
[55:51] we want to drink into that spirit
[55:54] we want god and and when i say that i
[55:56] mean we've got to
[55:58] we've got to just let go and let god
[56:00] have his way
[56:02] hallelujah because sometimes we do have
[56:05] infirmities
[56:06] and like the scripture says you know our
[56:08] infirmities everybody have has them and
[56:10] you know when it comes to knowing how to
[56:13] pray
[56:14] how many of y'all know how to pray all
[56:15] the time no
[56:17] don't even go there because you don't
[56:19] until the lord revealed to you
[56:21] what is needed that is the only way you
[56:23] know how to pray
[56:25] it all is all it always will be
[56:28] a revelation on how to pray and what to
[56:31] pray for
[56:33] now i don't know about you but i can see
[56:36] the tidal waves
[56:37] i see the thing coming our way you ought
[56:40] to be able to see this is not a time to
[56:42] be
[56:43] lukewarm and lazy and dilatory in the
[56:46] last few days i've been just confessing
[56:48] and asking god to forgive me
[56:52] for not being the kind of christians
[56:54] that i
[56:55] i should be or the kind that he's
[56:57] requiring me to be
[57:00] you say you brother books absolutely i
[57:02] can see where i've let him down
[57:06] many times allowing worldly things to
[57:08] get involved and
[57:10] hello y'all understand what i'm trying
[57:13] to say there is no time for that
[57:16] it really is no time for that somehow
[57:19] we've got to girdle up the lawns of our
[57:21] mind
[57:22] and recognize this is the time
[57:25] was that right and all i could hear this
[57:28] morning and today
[57:29] not all but the bride has made
[57:33] herself ready y'all want god to do it
[57:37] all
[57:37] no the bride has made herself
[57:41] ready huh
[57:44] this is a love affair
[57:47] we we look at peter and paul and john
[57:50] and all those ones who
[57:51] became martyrs for jesus christ but
[57:54] those people loved god
[57:56] even to the death hallelujah they
[57:59] weren't concerned about
[58:00] how they live and how great they were
[58:02] and what kind of mansion they had and
[58:05] most of those people all they had was
[58:06] sheepskin and caves
[58:09] but they were happy they had a joy you
[58:12] understand me
[58:13] hallelujah that's where brother man was
[58:15] he was a poor man
[58:17] but he had a joy he met the pill of fire
[58:21] and that was his joy he could care less
[58:24] on the you know whether his suit was
[58:26] matching or not
[58:28] when i thought i might as well be
[58:30] comfortable tonight
[58:34] it doesn't matter we're getting ready
[58:37] and the truth of the matter is
[58:38] it's not going to be easy now i read
[58:41] some things and i don't know how true
[58:43] they
[58:43] are but i do know one thing there's
[58:45] going to be a lot of pressure put on you
[58:48] amen when it comes to this vaccine that
[58:51] is something that
[58:52] you have to work out within yourself you
[58:54] know what i'm saying
[58:56] right we're not going to go any further
[58:58] with that i just say it's something that
[59:00] you have to work out
[59:01] if you felt feel led to take it take it
[59:04] but better understand
[59:05] whatever you turn into is your own fault
[59:13] don't blame the doctor cause you gave
[59:15] him your consent
[59:16] y'all know that thing ain't ready for
[59:18] nothing
[59:20] it's the truth and i'm not trying to be
[59:22] funny but it's the truth people have
[59:24] been dying from it
[59:26] right so let's move on by the grace of
[59:28] god but you know what you're the ones
[59:29] that seem crazy because you don't
[59:32] believe in science in that way
[59:34] you believe in god we understand that
[59:37] god
[59:38] is our supplier that's what i try to
[59:40] tell people i like science are you
[59:42] serious
[59:43] i know the god that created science not
[59:46] taken away from the hospitals and things
[59:48] amen they have their place but you don't
[59:51] force
[59:51] things on us not the christian
[59:56] remember i told you when i was preaching
[59:58] on samson
[59:59] you're the main event all of these
[1:00:03] things
[1:00:03] right now are happening to push the
[1:00:06] bride
[1:00:06] in her position amen
[1:00:10] absolutely and you say well what's wrong
[1:00:13] with i'm
[1:00:14] there's a part of me that's happy
[1:00:16] there's a part of me that stands secure
[1:00:20] but i can't wait to that anointing
[1:00:23] anoint the words that's in me and make
[1:00:26] it live is that right
[1:00:28] that's that's it it takes the anointing
[1:00:32] to anoint
[1:00:33] that's why we've been studying the word
[1:00:34] that's why we've been listening to the
[1:00:36] tapes
[1:00:36] that's why we've been reading our word
[1:00:38] so that when that time come
[1:00:40] the anointing of god will anoint
[1:00:42] everything in us
[1:00:43] it'll be god in you right
[1:00:47] what shall we say and i'm i want to
[1:00:48] encourage you
[1:00:50] what shall we say to these things
[1:00:54] if god be for you who can be against you
[1:00:58] people of god don't you understand no
[1:01:01] one can be against you
[1:01:03] and prevail hallelujah isaiah said
[1:01:06] what weapon that's formed against us
[1:01:10] shall prosper nothing amen
[1:01:13] amen understand the shock is not the
[1:01:16] mark of the beast
[1:01:17] okay a lot of people think it's
[1:01:19] democracy that ain't it is when you
[1:01:21] reject the word of god
[1:01:23] for your day
[1:01:27] but i ain't looking for nothing they're
[1:01:28] giving out freely
[1:01:32] y'all know what i'm saying in that in
[1:01:34] that way
[1:01:35] hallelujah and the thing that you and i
[1:01:37] must understand like i said
[1:01:39] it's going to be really simple but what
[1:01:40] we need to understand is that we have to
[1:01:43] examine ourselves
[1:01:44] how honest have we been not only to god
[1:01:48] but to ourselves
[1:01:53] honesty you must have honesty
[1:01:56] to go any further brother said i can
[1:01:59] look at you
[1:02:00] knowing that i will meet you at the day
[1:02:03] of judgment
[1:02:04] at the end of the world and say this one
[1:02:07] thing
[1:02:08] that the product that i am telling you
[1:02:10] about jesus christ
[1:02:12] the son of god lives and reigns tonight
[1:02:16] and this is the power this is this is
[1:02:18] what shook me he said
[1:02:20] and he's just as powerful
[1:02:24] just as real and just
[1:02:27] as alive as he ever was
[1:02:30] at any time y'all understand that
[1:02:33] we're not dealing with a historical god
[1:02:36] we need god we
[1:02:37] we need to contact him you know what i
[1:02:38] mean we need him
[1:02:40] so he can reveal to us he never changed
[1:02:43] when william branham
[1:02:44] went on he never changed he's still here
[1:02:48] he's still god he's still doing the same
[1:02:51] thing
[1:02:51] he you you got to understand if we're
[1:02:54] failing
[1:02:55] it's not because god is making us fail
[1:03:01] if anything a man ought to be
[1:03:04] honest god will respect you
[1:03:10] when you become honest
[1:03:13] you know and that's the thing like i
[1:03:15] said you and i when we look at this
[1:03:16] thing we've got
[1:03:17] you and i need to say i'm right there
[1:03:19] with samson
[1:03:21] i'm a failure all that you tried to get
[1:03:25] me to do i have failed
[1:03:27] the world has come in i've done this
[1:03:29] that and the other i've
[1:03:30] never listened how when's the last time
[1:03:32] we witnessed to anybody
[1:03:35] y'all understand me it shows amen that
[1:03:38] that's our commission but when we don't
[1:03:39] talk about it
[1:03:40] when we don't witness it shows we're
[1:03:42] backslidden
[1:03:44] he said well i ain't got nobody to
[1:03:46] witness to you know how to pray
[1:03:49] lord send somebody my way
[1:03:54] right the other day i was from the
[1:03:57] poured on a guy and he cut me off
[1:03:59] but i was going after him
[1:04:03] i was going to let him know that jesus
[1:04:05] saves
[1:04:09] now these things we we look at this and
[1:04:11] we say okay
[1:04:13] what is the difference see many times
[1:04:16] i've looked
[1:04:17] at services and i'm thinking wow you
[1:04:19] know
[1:04:20] my definition of being dead is has been
[1:04:23] totally wrong
[1:04:24] because you can sit still and not be
[1:04:26] dead you understand what i'm saying you
[1:04:28] don't have to jump
[1:04:29] you don't have to shout you don't have
[1:04:31] to run up and down the aisle
[1:04:32] to prove that you're alive because most
[1:04:35] of the time when people do all of that
[1:04:37] they're not alive and why you say that
[1:04:40] because
[1:04:40] the reason is is that they're looking at
[1:04:43] the wrong thing
[1:04:44] thinking that's god when they can do
[1:04:47] that in the club
[1:04:48] when they can do that at the ball game
[1:04:50] and don't tell me they don't feel an
[1:04:52] anointing
[1:04:53] oh there is an anointing i can remember
[1:04:56] being in the ball game and
[1:04:57] you know they hit a two pawn or
[1:04:58] three-pointer and i'm up out of my seat
[1:05:02] before i know it i'm coming to myself
[1:05:04] feeling stupid
[1:05:08] but that's the anointing i allowed
[1:05:09] myself to get into that anointing
[1:05:12] and people of god let's not let's not
[1:05:15] we need the anointing
[1:05:18] the anointing not a anointing the
[1:05:21] anointing
[1:05:22] even when the man preached his preaching
[1:05:25] is a different anointing
[1:05:27] same god but working in a different
[1:05:30] office
[1:05:31] hallelujah but we need that that
[1:05:34] anointing that shekinah
[1:05:38] understand me when you got the shekinah
[1:05:42] that love will enforce itself
[1:05:46] oh yeah somebody come and eat they got
[1:05:49] to tell you
[1:05:50] off and all of that all of a sudden the
[1:05:51] holy ghost put you there
[1:05:53] or even if you make a mistake he checks
[1:05:55] you and you got to confess and make it
[1:05:57] right
[1:05:58] that's power that's the holy ghost
[1:06:01] it's just that simple and
[1:06:04] hearing that still small voice
[1:06:08] i was going to i talked with brother
[1:06:11] works yesterday and i said
[1:06:13] you know i think i'm going to come out
[1:06:14] to uh
[1:06:16] to uh harmony in the desert i just found
[1:06:18] out they're gonna have it
[1:06:20] and this morning when i woke up the holy
[1:06:22] ghost says
[1:06:24] don't go so i'm not going
[1:06:28] so tomorrow i've got to call him and let
[1:06:30] him know i'm not coming
[1:06:32] not that i'm afraid of anything but he
[1:06:34] told me not to go
[1:06:36] so that's all that uh that's besides i
[1:06:38] don't know no new songs anyway
[1:06:42] you know it's just what it is and i
[1:06:43] won't stop anybody else from going
[1:06:45] but my point is this it's not time the
[1:06:48] time is now to examine yourself
[1:06:50] to see whether you be in the faith
[1:06:52] singing you can sing all you want
[1:06:54] dancing all you want
[1:06:55] but that's not it we've had that for
[1:06:58] hundreds of years
[1:07:00] pentecostals and all had all of that
[1:07:04] i was looking at a youtube thing the
[1:07:06] other day and i couldn't
[1:07:07] in 1980 and they were getting
[1:07:10] down and supposed to be singing about
[1:07:14] jesus and i thought to myself that's
[1:07:17] 1980.
[1:07:19] i don't even know what they're doing now
[1:07:21] what are they doing
[1:07:24] it's a state of apostasy they feel that
[1:07:27] anointing
[1:07:28] and they fail to see you can't do what
[1:07:30] you do in the club in the church
[1:07:33] no two different anointings i don't care
[1:07:35] how much you call on the name of jesus
[1:07:37] that don't sanctify what you're doing
[1:07:40] anyway i don't know how i stumbled i
[1:07:43] wasn't even looking for it but
[1:07:45] curiosity though i speak with tongues
[1:07:48] and of men and of angels and have not
[1:07:50] charity
[1:07:51] an old message paul preached this
[1:07:56] over a thousand years ago an old
[1:07:59] message and it's still holding fast
[1:08:02] today
[1:08:04] right it god don't care if i am
[1:08:08] become as a and brass or tinkling simmer
[1:08:11] and though i have the gift of prophet
[1:08:12] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[1:08:15] and
[1:08:16] and all knowledge and and though i have
[1:08:18] all faith so that i could remove
[1:08:20] mountains and
[1:08:21] have not charity i am nothing now let me
[1:08:24] ask you a question
[1:08:28] do you really think god don't mean what
[1:08:32] he's saying
[1:08:33] he means exactly what he's saying
[1:08:37] you can be a superman in the religious
[1:08:39] realm and you still don't have
[1:08:41] love it profits you nothing
[1:08:48] i don't want to come up short i don't
[1:08:51] care what
[1:08:52] it takes where god's got to take me to
[1:08:55] get there
[1:08:56] i don't care about the pain i don't care
[1:08:58] about the sorrow i don't care about
[1:08:59] nothing right now but pleasing my lord
[1:09:03] and that might not sound right to you
[1:09:04] but i know i mean
[1:09:06] you know i'll be 65 this month that's
[1:09:08] closer that's getting pretty close
[1:09:11] to 70.
[1:09:14] 7-0 right that's pretty close that's all
[1:09:18] he promised me
[1:09:21] five more years brother brooks you just
[1:09:24] never know
[1:09:26] so i've got to do excuse me
[1:09:29] i've got to do what i need to do in this
[1:09:33] little space and
[1:09:34] time whatever god can help me with and
[1:09:36] give me
[1:09:37] i want it all y'all understand me i'm
[1:09:40] tired of competition
[1:09:42] i'm tired of people trying to put me in
[1:09:44] this and put me on that
[1:09:46] and try to determine what is and what is
[1:09:48] not i don't care about that stuff
[1:09:50] right now i really i got my eyes on
[1:09:52] jesus
[1:09:54] i'm focusing on him now i'm looking at
[1:09:56] him so that i won't be sinking in this
[1:09:58] storm
[1:09:59] i'm focusing on him this is what we must
[1:10:02] do and yes
[1:10:03] it is difficult huh because many of us
[1:10:06] have habits
[1:10:07] that we've got to give up
[1:10:10] i'm not exempt things we know we got to
[1:10:13] give up
[1:10:14] hallelujah and we say oh god you know
[1:10:16] the lord showed me something the other
[1:10:17] day say
[1:10:18] when i was preaching i said you don't
[1:10:19] need the holy ghost to overcome certain
[1:10:22] things you just need willpower you just
[1:10:23] need to stop
[1:10:26] that's true people say well you know he
[1:10:29] he he smokes and he needs the holy ghost
[1:10:32] hello there's a lot of people who smoke
[1:10:34] or did smoke and stopped
[1:10:40] yeah i had a brother who had been an
[1:10:41] alcoholic all his life he stopped
[1:10:45] now i don't understand it but i know
[1:10:47] when you get in your mind to do
[1:10:49] something like that
[1:10:50] it just happens and i call that faith
[1:10:53] that you didn't even know you had
[1:10:56] amen hallelujah
[1:10:59] yes and when god talked to me that
[1:11:02] about that the other lady guess what he
[1:11:05] made me an overcomer
[1:11:07] you don't know what i was going through
[1:11:08] but he made me an overcomer
[1:11:11] i feel the difference i see the
[1:11:13] difference only because
[1:11:15] i decided enough is enough
[1:11:19] now if you love god you got to put god
[1:11:22] first
[1:11:23] you got to talk to the devil like you
[1:11:25] really are in love with god
[1:11:27] right because that's when the devil talk
[1:11:29] that's when the devil hear you
[1:11:31] when you put god first he has to heal
[1:11:34] you
[1:11:35] and though i restore all my goods to
[1:11:37] feed the poor and though i give my body
[1:11:39] to be burned
[1:11:40] and have not charity it profits will be
[1:11:42] nothing
[1:11:43] charity suffered that long charity
[1:11:45] suffereth long
[1:11:46] and it's kind charity envy is not
[1:11:49] charity violence that itself is not
[1:11:51] puffed up
[1:11:52] ain't no bishop hallelujah real
[1:11:56] no that ain't charity and the closer
[1:11:59] man get to god the more humble he
[1:12:00] becomes
[1:12:02] hallelujah yes we get too carried away
[1:12:06] with in this message what people think
[1:12:08] of us
[1:12:08] i don't care anymore i knew god before i
[1:12:11] came here
[1:12:13] hello that's the reason why i'm here do
[1:12:16] you think i would ever come up to des
[1:12:17] moines on my own
[1:12:19] ain't no way excuse me for saying it
[1:12:21] like that but that i came because i was
[1:12:23] led by god
[1:12:24] god led me here because others were
[1:12:26] praying
[1:12:28] and through their prayers god led me
[1:12:30] here and i that's why i have confidence
[1:12:32] it doesn't matter i was telling the lord
[1:12:34] i said lord even if it go down to two or
[1:12:36] three
[1:12:37] i still know you brought me here
[1:12:42] one thing about love it trusts
[1:12:46] charity never faileth but what whether
[1:12:48] there be prophecy
[1:12:50] it shall fail whether there'll be
[1:12:51] tongues they shall cease and we know
[1:12:53] that right
[1:12:54] because all of those prophets on
[1:12:56] television or you
[1:12:57] youtube whatever you know they
[1:12:59] prophesied trump was going to get it
[1:13:01] trump was going to get it
[1:13:03] and then they had to come back and
[1:13:04] correct things
[1:13:07] now i still don't know what's going to
[1:13:08] happen i just know by god's grace
[1:13:11] everything looking good for the for the
[1:13:14] one world order to come into play
[1:13:16] and when that come into play it's going
[1:13:17] home time
[1:13:21] hallelujah i'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:13:24] of christ
[1:13:25] it is the power of god unto salvation
[1:13:28] our message is different we have eyes to
[1:13:31] see
[1:13:32] the world can't see they're in darkness
[1:13:35] gross darkness
[1:13:41] hallelujah is that right brother branham
[1:13:44] said
[1:13:44] in this age that love would be such a
[1:13:47] strange thing
[1:13:49] did you know that oh it's true you can
[1:13:52] go shake a brother hand and
[1:13:54] hug him around the neck and then
[1:13:55] somebody look at you and thank you
[1:13:58] strange
[1:14:00] sisters too they'd rather think carnally
[1:14:04] that you've got something going on
[1:14:05] hello i'm talking about so-called
[1:14:07] believe us
[1:14:11] what he said what do you mean paul said
[1:14:14] greet your brother with a kiss
[1:14:16] that's that's on the neck now
[1:14:21] anyplace else is wrong right but
[1:14:24] even so we don't do that but i know one
[1:14:27] brother always
[1:14:28] catches me off guard aaron mcgarry
[1:14:32] and i hope he hears this
[1:14:35] you think i'll be used to it there's
[1:14:37] another brother from india
[1:14:38] that used to catch me all the time but
[1:14:41] aaron
[1:14:42] had a way of sneaking it on me yeah i'm
[1:14:44] telling you
[1:14:45] and i would just feel this rush like
[1:14:50] right there's nothing wrong with it
[1:14:53] there are other brothers who've done it
[1:14:56] that is all right it's okay as long as
[1:14:59] you're in the right spirit
[1:15:01] but and that's the love of god it's it's
[1:15:04] a strange
[1:15:05] thing when you tell a brother i love you
[1:15:10] brothers and now they can't handle that
[1:15:14] and you're supposed to tell each other
[1:15:16] you love each other
[1:15:18] and they look at you like what in the
[1:15:21] world you got going on there
[1:15:24] right and there's nothing you pure in
[1:15:26] your heart
[1:15:28] but it's such a strange thing for a man
[1:15:30] to love another man
[1:15:32] and be straight or a woman with a woman
[1:15:36] this is the day we're living in
[1:15:38] everything is perverted
[1:15:40] and i'm not going to go any further with
[1:15:42] that but that's what love has done it's
[1:15:44] come down to the lowest
[1:15:45] the lowest the lowest the lowest and god
[1:15:48] in this day is requiring us to go up to
[1:15:49] the highest
[1:15:51] divine love is the highest you can go
[1:15:54] and i'm
[1:15:54] i'm gonna close in just a bit but
[1:15:57] remember brother brandon preached
[1:15:58] desperation right after the seals
[1:16:02] and he said if the people don't get
[1:16:03] desperate they're going to miss it
[1:16:06] and how many of us are desperate
[1:16:10] say brother books i'm not desperate i
[1:16:11] don't know how to be desperate
[1:16:15] you can always pray for it but
[1:16:17] understand when you pray for it
[1:16:20] tribulations work with patience
[1:16:23] it's coming but god will put you in a
[1:16:25] desperate position
[1:16:27] amen so that you can cross over it's all
[1:16:30] about crossing over
[1:16:32] going beyond the veil that's what it is
[1:16:34] that's why god opened the seals that's
[1:16:36] why we
[1:16:37] know the things we know but we're not
[1:16:39] here to stand in the outer court or the
[1:16:41] inner court we're supposed to go into
[1:16:42] the holies of holies and not just
[1:16:44] temporarily going in near the visit
[1:16:47] we suppose brothers say go in there and
[1:16:49] shut the curtain behind you
[1:16:52] we're supposed to that's our dwelling
[1:16:54] place
[1:16:56] i'm praying i want it all
[1:17:02] books are you there yet by faith
[1:17:05] but i want to see it i want to see that
[1:17:09] anointing i want to see that life
[1:17:11] i want to see all of that i want to see
[1:17:13] it that's what he promised us
[1:17:14] and people of god we better get
[1:17:16] desperate we better ask god help us lord
[1:17:20] because one day we don't know when the
[1:17:22] door is going to shut
[1:17:24] right it's going to shut how many of
[1:17:26] y'all know that
[1:17:27] noah preached 120 years and when the
[1:17:29] doors shut nobody else could go in
[1:17:32] and there were times that even the
[1:17:33] prophet of god didn't even know whether
[1:17:34] the door was shut or not
[1:17:36] he said could it be is it has the last
[1:17:39] one coming in yet
[1:17:40] and that's in the 60s what about now
[1:17:44] when we who are in the message claim
[1:17:46] that we've got so much and
[1:17:47] all we've got is a system people don't
[1:17:50] like me saying that
[1:17:52] but i hate systems i see systems
[1:17:56] i'm not a part of that i'm breaking away
[1:17:59] from all of that
[1:18:00] just to find my lord just to know who he
[1:18:04] is so that he can know he knows me but i
[1:18:06] need to know who he is
[1:18:08] right when you think about all of those
[1:18:10] saints of god
[1:18:12] amen i had had some other things but
[1:18:14] when we think about
[1:18:15] supreme sovereign grace we must
[1:18:18] understand by god's grace that
[1:18:20] this sovereign grace is god you don't
[1:18:23] deserve it
[1:18:25] he chose you you didn't choose him
[1:18:28] and when it comes to your trials and
[1:18:31] difficulties
[1:18:32] and things you think god don't
[1:18:33] understand
[1:18:35] we often say god won't put us on us no
[1:18:38] more than we can bear
[1:18:39] and that's true god will never put on
[1:18:42] us uh more than we can bear and in in
[1:18:45] fact the fact of the matter is
[1:18:47] when it gets to the place that you can't
[1:18:48] bear it that's when you're supposed to
[1:18:50] cast your cares upon him
[1:18:52] he cares for you like the prophet said
[1:18:55] he cares do you care
[1:18:57] and that's the thing we must all care i
[1:18:59] i know this message is right
[1:19:01] i know it's 100 right
[1:19:06] and like the prophet god said if i if i
[1:19:08] can't obtain it i'm not going to stand
[1:19:09] in nobody else's way
[1:19:12] but it's my goal amen to see that pill
[1:19:15] of fire
[1:19:16] living in me hallelujah
[1:19:20] and folks we one thing i know is that
[1:19:24] the pressure is going to stir us up
[1:19:28] i was telling somebody today window when
[1:19:30] all these people who
[1:19:31] thought they weren't believers began to
[1:19:33] see this thing for
[1:19:34] unfolding the way we've been trying to
[1:19:36] tell them it's going to unfold it's
[1:19:37] going to get their attention
[1:19:38] and i just trust by the grace of god
[1:19:41] it's not too late
[1:19:44] that's the thing you love the lord
[1:19:47] we need to love one another when we see
[1:19:49] somebody missing
[1:19:51] or somebody's not here we need to
[1:19:53] inquire
[1:19:54] and that is not just the pastor's job
[1:19:57] it's everybody's job and my wife brought
[1:20:01] up a subject a thing
[1:20:03] that we need a phone list again
[1:20:06] we do we used to have a phone list you
[1:20:09] know
[1:20:09] where people had their names and
[1:20:11] addresses and whatever the case may be
[1:20:14] i love to have that again so that
[1:20:17] if somebody is missing i'll have
[1:20:20] the number where we could call and
[1:20:23] listen
[1:20:24] a call nowadays don't cost you nothing
[1:20:26] when i was
[1:20:27] when i was coming up it was a nickel
[1:20:29] dime quarter
[1:20:32] it costs you nothing now
[1:20:35] and i know you said well brother books
[1:20:36] what are you trying to say listen i
[1:20:38] don't care how much
[1:20:39] thunder you think you know how you know
[1:20:41] the seven seals
[1:20:43] you know oh lord you know all the
[1:20:45] mysteries of the old testament of
[1:20:46] redemption
[1:20:47] it'll do you no good until
[1:20:51] you're capped off with the love of god
[1:20:54] and i hope i've got a lot of people
[1:20:56] listening to me tonight it's simple
[1:20:59] but it's true it's real and we're
[1:21:02] getting ready to face a battle
[1:21:04] and the only force that's going to
[1:21:06] conquer this is love
[1:21:08] y'all understand me when they came at
[1:21:10] peter them to to
[1:21:12] to to destroy what happened peter got
[1:21:14] his sword and tried to cut the man's ear
[1:21:16] off
[1:21:16] and jesus said if you fight with the
[1:21:18] sword you're going to die with the sword
[1:21:20] but what did jesus do he humbled himself
[1:21:22] like a lamb
[1:21:24] hallelujah oh i got my rifle brother
[1:21:26] when they come
[1:21:28] yeah fight with that and you're gonna
[1:21:30] die with that
[1:21:32] right our love is the conquering
[1:21:35] element it is the force that god has
[1:21:38] ordained
[1:21:38] us to have to conquer the devil
[1:21:42] right and remember that quote he said
[1:21:46] jesus defeated the devil
[1:21:49] with meekness and sweetness
[1:21:55] that's uh brethren sweetness
[1:22:00] meekness yeah you love the lord
[1:22:04] i know it's simple but let's stand
[1:22:18] are we understanding can we see what god
[1:22:21] is requiring
[1:22:24] yeah i was talking
[1:22:29] the other day brother keith i might have
[1:22:31] been yesterday today and he
[1:22:33] mentioned love and had no idea that i
[1:22:35] was working in that area
[1:22:38] because i realized now that as a church
[1:22:41] we've been focusing on so many things
[1:22:44] and those things are not what we need
[1:22:49] it's good to know but without the holy
[1:22:52] ghost without the capstone
[1:22:54] but what good is it i tell you what
[1:22:58] i do not want to be left behind
[1:23:01] seriously i do not want to be left
[1:23:02] behind
[1:23:03] i can't imagine that i don't believe
[1:23:05] that's my destiny
[1:23:07] lord has been good to me has shown me
[1:23:09] things have been you know i just know
[1:23:11] i just believe with all my heart that
[1:23:14] i'm bright
[1:23:15] even though i'm not where i should be
[1:23:17] that anointing in me
[1:23:19] is carrying me it's taking me now and
[1:23:22] like i said once you come to a place in
[1:23:24] your life
[1:23:25] where you say i'm done
[1:23:30] i'm done with this stuff the world
[1:23:32] religion
[1:23:33] all of that i'm just lord i want you
[1:23:35] however you reveal yourself to me
[1:23:37] show me so that we can have an intimate
[1:23:40] relationship together
[1:23:42] not some church go up you know god show
[1:23:45] up every now and again we shout dance
[1:23:47] run out
[1:23:47] you know all that's good but that ain't
[1:23:50] it
[1:23:50] we've had all of that for years and the
[1:23:53] brother
[1:23:54] the prophet god said this is why the
[1:23:55] seals were open
[1:23:57] so that we could have that intimate
[1:24:00] relationship with uh behind me
[1:24:04] father we come before you as humbly as
[1:24:07] we know how we thank you for your grace
[1:24:10] we thank you for your goodness lord we
[1:24:13] realize lord without love
[1:24:15] hallelujah we're failures
[1:24:18] it's not something that we can produce
[1:24:20] we're not talking about
[1:24:21] video love because we fail
[1:24:24] we need a perfect love we need that
[1:24:26] agape
[1:24:28] we need you to come into our lives lord
[1:24:30] and make the difference
[1:24:32] it doesn't matter lord what it takes to
[1:24:34] get us there please
