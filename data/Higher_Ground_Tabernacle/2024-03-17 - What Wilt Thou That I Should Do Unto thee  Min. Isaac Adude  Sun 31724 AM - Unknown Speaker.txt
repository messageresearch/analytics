thank the Lord for everything that he has done for us amen [Music] amen amen amen we greet you on the name one Lord Jesus man we're so happy to be here amen this Sunday morning amen I'll Fly Away that's one of my favorite songs my my version is a little different than what you all sing cuz I I don't say when I die but I say I won't die amen but I'll be raptured buy and buy because we know the Bible tells us that there will be some of us who won't die but we will be changed amen so if you believe that you'll be a part of those people who want die you might as well start professing you might as well am you might as well start singing it amen I won't die but I'll be raptured by amen amen we thank the Lord for his goodness and gra amen it's a privilege to stand here before you again this morning amen amen amen let's go straight to the word and open our Bibles in The Book of Mark then we read the verse uh Mark chapter 10 we read the verse 46 to verse 52 uh verse 46 52 U there's a little more base on my think you can turn it on Mark 10 verse 46-52 maren the Bible says that and they came to Jericho and as he went out of as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bimus the son of uh uh uh timus Sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and said Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great dear thou son of David have mercy on [Music] me man it's like what believe Elijah believe say that it's like fire shut up in my [Music] b sometimes you just can't hold your peace you just have to let it go verse 49 the Bible says that and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they called him they called the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garments Rose and came to Jesus amen this is my favorite verse and Jesus answered and said unto him what would thou that I should do unto thee the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately he received his sign and followed Jesus in the way amen what will thou that I should do unto thee amen let's bow our head father God we humbly come before your throne of grace this morning Lord to say thank you Father Lord thank you for everything that you have done for us Lord Lord thank you Father for this morning of Resurrection father Lord thank you Father for giving us a good heal Lord thank you Father Lord for bringing us to your house this morning Lord we just pray father God that you you you that you open this Bible to us and you explain it to us oh Father Lord we pray father God that you open our understanding oh Lord and you speak to our hearts this morning Father Lord we give you all the thanks Lord I pray father Lord that you help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit Lord that I can only say what you want me to say father Lord in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated man this morning we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you amen we we took it out of this verse this question that Jesus asked blus what will thou that I should do unto thee sir amen last time the last time when we preached we preached about uh uh uh the you know joash and Elijah amen when Elijah told him to go get those arrows and errors representing deliverance and he needed to have enough faith for him to take as many errors as he wanted man just to continue on that thought we're going to continue with that as well amen so now God Jesus is telling you what would what what will thou that I should do unto thee what do you want that I do to for for you amen because when we read the Bible the prophet tells us that we have to replace ourselves in the Bible we have to place our names in the Bible amen we read this is a story about the blind body M Jesus asking that question to the blind body M what want me to do for you amen so now this morning we have to take the blind body M out of the picture and put our names and that amen Make It Personal Jesus asking you this morning what do you want me to do for you amen the prophet gave a story story of that man uh uh the prophet gave a story of that young man who was on a was on the board with the captain the captain was sick amen the young man remember the stories remember the the uh the Sunday schools and all the Bible studies had with his grandma and his parents in particular he had one verse that he remembered the amen that that he was told to always replace his name in that verse and then he applied the same Faith amen for the captain's healing he told the captain that if this works for me if this has been working for me every day that I apply it I believe that if you put your name in that verse as well it's going to work for you that verse tells us amen but he was wounded for our transgressions amen he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed he said Captain if you can only place your name in that verse let's say his name was Isaac amen but he was wounded for the transgression of ISAC he was bruised for the iniquities of Isaac the chastisement of Isaac's peace was upon him and with his tribes Isaac is healed amen and after repeating that verse the captain recovered the captain because he applied the faith in other words he mixed his faith with the word of God Paul tells us in Hebrews he said that when you hear the word of Goden you just don't have to stop by hearing the word but you have to mix the your faith with the word of God that's when you have the results am so now is the question amen Jesus is asking you amen what do you want me to do for you am so your answer has to be mixed with the faith because remember that blind body May the Bible said that he heard Jesus Christ coming and notice that every time that Jesus was going somewhere noices were always going before he arrives remember when Lazarus died the Bible says that Jesus was two miles away from the house amen Mar already heard the news of Jesus coming amen so Jesus was to Miles Away amen so meaning that that blind body M when you heard Jesus was coming Jesus was a little farther away from from where he was amen so notice that that man was a poor man he was a beggar so we we might as well say that he was hungry but time he was was about to ask for God to to to to to heal him amen the prophet said that he was hungry he was skinny maybe skinnier than me amen but he was hungry and skinny so in other words he couldn't have his voice couldn't be loud enough for Jesus to hear it because Jesus is clear saying that Jesus was walking with his disciple and a great multitude amen so he had bunch of he had loud noises around him some people criticizing him amen some people blaming him for the death of their family members some people saying whatever thing that they had to say so everybody was saying something so Naturally Speaking that man did not have the strength in him to be so loud that will be know surpass all those noises to could get to Jesus hears that thing that that man had that was different than other people that had a faith that was going behind his voice a faith that was above everybody else's faith that was able to break out the barriers go straight to Jesus ears Jesus can hear him calling him so when Jesus heard the facei of that man amen Jesus stopped amen certainly the disciples were asking but well Jesus why are you stopping where Jesus might have said I heard somebody calling me Peter might have said butes everybody's shouting here I'm right next to you and I can't even get a word of anything coming out of this people Jesus might have to looked at Peter and said that this one is different this one is clear this one is different amen it's another Channel amen this one is coming from a private Channel amen it's something that I can't answer directly and call that that guy go and call him amen and they said that every once once he was called he left everything that he was doing amen that's the attitude we have to have when Jesus calls you you have to leave everything that you're doing you have to leave all and follow him you have to leave everything and go respond to the you have to be like Samuel amen after after God called him for the for the third time he says here I am Master speak for thy servant hear that has to be our attitude when Jesus calls us amen when he came to Jesus Jesus asked him what do you want me to do for you I'm pretty sure you stopped me for reason I'm pretty sure you had a faith for a reason amen so when I was reading it I started asking myself Jesus knows everything amen remember we was somewhere and people were thinking things about him and he was able to hear the [Music] thought the woman at the well Jesus knew her life amen Jesus knew exactly what that man needed amen so why did he ask him what do you want me to do for you amen think of it think about that for a minute amen he knew everything amen he could read the heart of men but yet he asked him what do you want me to do for you amen because if you read the chapter that comes after that amen that would be Mark 11 we read verse 22 to uh to 25 amen and the the bible say that and Jesus answering sayith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and he shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sath shall come to pass and he shall receive uh and and he shall have whatsoever he saith amen the reason is because God God gave us power with our tongues amen he said that whatsoever you sayith amen remember Daniel when Daniel when when Daniel in Babylon you know when Daniel the the the story of you know that the story of the Angel and Daniel when the when the angel came with an answer to Daniel what what did the angel say they said that as soon as you open your mouth and started praying amen because there is power behind our behind our Tong there's power with everything that you say Amen you have been given the power to speak the word and you will see it accomplished God told Moses Moses why are you crying amen just speak amen because that's the power of the believer amen you have the power to speak and change the situation you have the power to speak and your life will be changed you have the power to speak and you will receive the healing of your body you have the power to speak and you will see great things happening in your life therefore I say unto you that what things soever you desire when you you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen the power behind behind your behind your tongue amen now the prophet says that now could you have that kind of Faith tonight in God's word well Jesus is his word could you have that much faith in God's word just as directly identified for this day as much as it was identified in that day could you believe that whatsoever you ask God God will give it to you see you say but the doctor turned me down man the doctor turned me down brother Brandon said he can't do no more for Meen but even now Lord say I haven't walked for years even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you he is sitting at the right hand of his of the Majesty on [Music] high for you to ask even now whatever you ask God will give it to you amen even now Lord amen it doesn't matter how long you've been in that situation I haven't walked for years amen I've been going back and forth from the hospital to the hospital amen I've heard this report from this doctor and for the other doctor there is no all hope is gone even now Lord amen whatsoever you ask amen God gave you the power to ask whatsoever you want God gave you the ability to ask whatever you want that God will give you the desire of your heart the Bible God Jesus did not you know list the number of things that we had to ask because he knew by listing things that we want we had to ask someone will come with something that's not listed and then he will get that as the reason that God doesn't list God doesn't hear my prayers he gave you that he gave you that open door he gave you that that check that the amount is not written on it amen say that you write whatever you want amen whatever numbers that you want to write am you just write it on Amen and you will receive it amen but you have to have the faith behind it amen it's not always what we say Amen but do we really believe what we say Amen have faith and it shall be shall be it shall be given to you amen but if God is God he's just says he just as great one time as he is the other day amen he doesn't fail he's just the same amen he can't be great one time and not great the other he's got to be great all the time in order for him to be God Amen he has to be greaten he has to act as I've said many times on every case like he acted on the first case if he didn't he did wrong the way he acted am if he heal the people in the Old Testament amen and heal them in the New Testament the same as he did in the old and the New Testament amen and won't heal them today then there is something wrong with God Amen we all believe that God isn't God our God doesn't change amen whatever he did back then is is able to do it today but most of the time we don't apply the exact same faith we read the word amen but we read it as stories amen we read it as as if we're reading the story of Abraham Lincoln am we're reading it as if we're reading a story of of some great man in the past we're reading it as if for reading some paper some some some some new new new how do you call it newspaper but we don't read it and apply the same Faith as we are supposed to amen if you read something amen you put yourself in that situation and you apply the same faith for that situation I promise you that you will receive the same results because if God did it back then amen he's the same God to do it today if God was able to provide healing for the children of Israel in the desert that remember that that that generation was an ungrateful generation compling every chance they had amen they wanted to return back to Egypt amen every time they could have think about it but nevertheless amen amen despite their weaknesses amen God was able to provide healing for them despite their weaknesses God was able to feed them every day desite their weaknesses God was able to give them water from The Rock about you am who call yourself a Believer who have the holy spirit inside of you who has the great one inside of you will not that God be the same able to Grant the desire for that ungrateful generation he be able to Grant you what you want he is the same God today he is the same God this morning if we can't even go beyond that God was able to Grant Satan's desires amen God was able to give it what he wanted when he wanted to go attack job he had to first go to God and ask God for permission amen what did God say God didn't tell him now go away you can ever touch him God gr him what he was asking for God said go ahead and do whatever you want but I'm not just going to let you to be free I going to set some boundaries am you can do whatever you want with him but don't touch his life God granted his desires amen look at when you went to the went to that Mania of of of of of of uh where was it from again uh uh G I believe amen amen he called himself the legion amen they had conversation with god I was reading it this morning amen I noticed the patience of Jesus with these demons amen Jesus asking them what is your name they responded our names we are our names are my name is Legion because we are many even to worship God Amen to tell you that when you come to church in the morning on Sunday devil also comes with you amen by the result you geten it depends on what you're giving to Jesus if you give him more importance than the devil he going toess you more remember that those Legion they went to worship Jesus they asking a question what you come to torment us amen they're having a conversation with Jesus amen if he can have conversation with Jesus if they can talk to Jesus amen so what about you you call yourself the Son of God why can't you have that conversation with your father can you have that conversation with your creator could have that conversation with Jesus Jesus was as special as he could be patient they ask a question he will respond to them amen he will ask them a question they will respond to them amen in some ways they were having their own Fellowship one-onone conversations amen if they can have that amen what about Meen I am the Son of God Amen created by his image made by his likeness he created me to be here for this purpose I have all the rights to go to him talk to him Amen to fellowship with him Amen to have conversation with him because he says behind us stand at the door and knock amen whoever go and open his door amen and let me in amen I will fellowship with him so in other words Jesus wants to have that fellowship with you Jesus wants to have that conversation with you the thing that happens is we not we don't go and open the door for him because the prophet says that he's not able to open that door for himself and do the work to go and open the door because Jesus will not come in the by the window he has to walk in in order for him to walk in to walk in you have to invite him and every time that you invite him he always show up amen every time you invite him amen he always show up amen he will show up amen amen they were talking to Jesus amen Jesus asked themen they asked Jesus for his favor amen let's read it it's in mark 5: 6 to verse 13 amen the Bible says but when he saw Jesus far off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and say what have I do what have I what have I to do with thee Jesus Son of son of the most high God IJ thee by God that thou torment me not for he said unto him this is Jesus talking come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is Legion for we are [Music] many and besought him and and besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country amen they knew very well when Jesus said come out of him amen Jesus did did not have to repeat that again amen they knew that the end of the story there were coming out amen so now they're started now to to you know to H to negotiate thank you brother to negotiate with Jesus Jesus we know the end of the story we will have to leave this man but please don't send us a way out of the country don't send us far don't send us far away amen there s a negotiating with Jesus amen it was like a business meeting it was like a business conference they're trying to negotiate terms amen verse 11 it says now now they're giving Jesus options amen now there was the there was there night uh unto the mountains a great herd of swan feeding amen and all the Devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter May into into them amen they're negotiating negotiating with Jesus and they're even bold enough to propose amen the the the you know the result or the to propose terms amen verse 13 the Bible says and for with Jesus gave them leave amen he gave them leave he granted their desire amen and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the her ran violently down a steep Place into the sea amen there were about 2,000 and were choked in the sea amen look at this story those unclean spirits amen they knew the result amen they knew the end of the journey that they were going to be cast away because Jesus says come out of the come out of him you un clean spirit amen even if they knew it they started to negotiate to propose better terms and Jesus was paion enough to he to listen to them amen and even grant them what they wanted amen so what about you amen the bible say that God created You In His Image and in his likeness amen he created you so that you can be like him amen that's why to save you amen he didn't want to send an angel to do it amen but he decided to create a man to create himself a body like you Amen to have that personal connection with you Amen in order for him to save us amen amen You Were Made In His Image amen but for your salvation amen God had to create himself a body like you Amen to save you amen if you had to do all those things amen he could have just say a word and things would have been changed amen but he had to do all of this amen being in this body the prophet said that he felt everything that you feeling am every situation that you go through Jesus had to go through it amen in order for him to understand your pain in order for him to understand your desire amen he did all of that Amen to build a certain relationship with you so that you can go to him in prayer and he will be given to you and he didn't even stop there amen but he said that amen he said that I will be with you even in you in other words amen he gave his created himself a body he suffered a pain he went on the cross to die for you and after that amen he didn't leave you alone he sent his Spirit to always be with you sent his Spirit to intercede for you that every time that you have a desire every time that you need something you can't quite explain it to him the holy spirit is there Amen to report that to cry to God to report that to the father in other words the reason you have the Holy Spirit take whatever you want am to explain it to the father in the better terms with the right words because with this Mortal tongue sometimes we just can't explain what we're feeling sometimes we just can't explain we just can't explain what we want that's why the prophet says am there is no better way to thank god with this m with this Mar tongue there's just no better words or no better things to say I mean you can try to say you know with words but that would not be enough amen sometimes you go to God In Prayer you praying for something but you can't quite explain it you don't quite understand what exactly you want you know that you need something and sometimes you even forget to ask about it God was thoughtful he thought about you so that's why he sent his holy spirit amen to be there to intercede for you Amen to take your desires to take your prayers amen and to bring it to the father amen so that you can so that you can have whatever you desire amen and now he's asking you what do you want me to do for you amen you have that opportunity the same one that joas Haden Elijah told him go get the arrows amen get as many arrows as you want amen because of the lack of faith he only took three amen and this is the opportunity for you as well what do you want me to do for you amen you're not answering to me amen but answer to him amen because he's the one asking you [Music] what do you want me to do for you Amen in the beginning of the service amen we said that you have to replace yourself in the Bible put yourself in the Bible amen originally this question was asked to the blind body M but when you put yourself in the Bible you replace blind the blind Body by with by your name it becomes a personal question to you what do you want me to do for you amen there is no limits to the answer it's everything that you ever wanted amen you have that opportunity amen God wants to grant you that desire amen what do you want me to do for [Music] you the prophet said that what good does it do to have a bird to have wings as long as you've got him in a cage he can't fly he don't need Wings if you got him in a cage amen he says that that's the way a lot of these people are they're in the cage tell the days of Miracles is passed oh there is God oh there is God oh yes we believe that Jesus was a son I've accepted him as a personal savior but I tell you all those things is back there in the old days they're past the days of Miracles is past what good is your wings going to do to you what good is your faith going to do to you if you can't turn it [Music] loose what good is your faith going to do if you can't put it in action certainly if I believe Jesus lives [Music] today I will put it in action amen he lives today he's the same Jesus certainly he is amen if the blind body May has could trust him I can too amen if the woman with the blood issue could touch His Garment amen I can too amen for he's open and willing he's begging and accepting whosoever will let him come and drink from the Waters of of of Life freely [Music] amen amen what we need today is a Revival of that type hallelujah amen if the blind body may could trust [Music] him so can I amen if that woman who was losing blood could touch his garments so can I amen remember that the woman who was losing blood the prophet said that that was the first that case was not mentioned before in the Bible but nevertheless that did not stop her from receiving what she wanted because knew she had such a strong faith she knew that once she touch Jesus garments the H of His Garment she will be made home amen it was the same situation with the blind body M Jesus was surrounded with people people touching him everywhere even having personal contact with him other people even being really close with Jesus touching his hands his feet and his his his hair and every part of his body but her faith was so strong she didn't need to be in contact physical contact with the body of Jesus she said that even Jesus garment even the the ham of His Garment just a little bit amen that is enough amen for me to receive the healing amen amen and that Faith was so strong by touching Jesus amen that took a virtue inside of Jesus Amen that took that virtue away and to go to apply it for a healing the prophet said the Bible says after she touched Jesus garments Jesus was sick I'm sorry Jesus was uh was tired was was weak amen so now the prophet asked the question he said what is great what is greater between raising up somebody from the dead and healing a person amen what is greater because remember before that Jesus went to the tomb of Lazarus amen and called Lazarus he said Lazarus come come forth amen but nowhere the Bible says that after doing it Jesus fell weak amen he resurrected somebody who was dead four days his body was already corrupted because corruption starts after three days Lazarus started to stink so no way Lazarus could have come back to life amen but Jesus went there and a single call it was a short prayer amen he said father I thank you because you heard my prayer then he said Lazarus come forth Lazarus came forth amen Lazarus started walking am but the Bible says that Jesus did not feel weak amen but when that woman touched him amen he did not touch Jesus body amen just the ham of His Garment that was able to heal her and made Jesus feel weak the prophet now said what is it what happened Jesus said that I can't do nothing I can't do anything before the father tells me to do tell to me the son doesn't do anything before the father tells him to do so the reason why Jesus did not feel weak when he when he resurrected Lazarus because the father already told him what he was supposed to do amen because the father already told him amen that Lazarus will die amen that you will have to go be late four days after all hope will be gone you will go and you will call Lazarus to come back to life but with this woman amen the prophet said that the father did not tell the son what was going to happen so that's why when she touched him Jesus felt it amen that took a virtue from Jesus in other words amen she transformed The Virtue that her faith was so strong Amen to take a virtue from Jesus and to apply it to our healing the prophet said that that is the same thing that happens to church when a preacher stands and started preaching sometimes they don't know what you going through they don't know what you're going not sometimes but they don't know what you're going through amen but in order for them amen to say exactly what you want you need to have a faith that will take that gift will take that virtue and apply it to your situation that's the thing that makes them feel weak sometimes because your faith is so strong it will take that virtue and apply it to whatever you want amen it's your faith that does it amen when brother Bram was doing the discernment the brother brandham I was reading it today this morning brother brandham said I wasn't because of my faith he was talking to a sister he said that if your faith let him amen tell me what you're going through then that will happen amen he didn't say because of my faith but he said that your faith will let him amen tell me what you're going through amen so it is your faith that operates the Miracles it is your faith amen that gives you whatever you want it is your faith amen that touches God am it's not your simple voice am it's not the physical contact that you have but it is the faith amen if it was physical amen then nobody will be healed right now because we can't touch him physically but we have to touch him by faith you have to raise your faith touch Jesus amen because I believe that he is here this morning because Jesus always come when we call him amen and when we started this this service we invited Jesus to come we call him to be among us we call him to hear our prayers call him to have the preeminence we call him to lead us we call him to lead the service so if you believe that Jesus is here just raise your faith amen let your faith touch him we let him know what you want that's the way you can communicate with himen it's with your Fai amen so just have faith amen because Jesus is here amen if Jesus went to Simon's house he knew that he will be mistreated at Simon's house he went anyway Amen to show you that every time you call him he will be there amen so what about this morning you raised up your voice to sing for him you responded to the service you responded to his word amen he's more than able to give you what you want just apply the faith apply the faith for your life amen apply the faith for the situation that you're going through the Bible says Matthew chapter 7 said that ask and it will be given to [Music] you seek and you will finden knock and it will be open to you amen for everyone who ask receives amen and the one who seeks finds and those and to the one who knocks it will be open amen oh which one of you if his son ask him for for bread will give him a stone or if he ask for a fish we give him a serpent if you then amen who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children amen how much more will your father amen who is in heaven amen give good things to those who ask him how much more your father amen call the B Jesus said that your father amen who is in heaven amen he will give you exactly what you're asking for and even better it will give you even more than what you're asking amen because the Bible says before you open your mouth I the Lord heard your prayer and again I granted your desire Philippians chapter 4 verse 6 [Music] to8 the Bible say do not be do not be anxious about anything amen amen Philippians chapter Philippians CH 4:8 to vers 4 6 to8 do not be anxious about anything but everything by prayer and supplications but but but but uh but but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known to God the peace of God which surpasses all understanding amen will God your heart and your minds in Christ Jesus finally Brothers whatever is true whatever is Honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commentable amen if there is any Excellence if there is anything worthy of Praise think about these things amen do not be anxious about anything amen but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known to God Amen but in everything by prayer amen that's the way that God provided amen for you to talk to him at any time any place any SE circumstances situation by prayer in everything by prayer and supplication and Thanksgiving it says that let your request be known to God Amen even though he knows what you what you need but he want he wants to hear it amen he knew what blind B wanted but he wanted to hear it amen what do you want me to do for you say it Whatever It Is sister Al right what do you want what do you want me to do for you say it speak it you the prophet said that at that time whatever she was going to say God was going to give it to her if she needed a plane God was going to create the plane right then and right there amen the prophet said that she was poor if she needed money God was going to f a bank account right there and right then amen because when God ask you something amen he has the means to provide the bible say that our father amen owns all the Catt of the mountain amen he owns everything so whatever you ask him know that he's able to give it to you he's the worthiest man in the world Amen he's a man who has everything amen he has Joy if he wants Joy he has healing if you want heal you want healing has peace if you want peace amen he has salvation if you want salvation he has the Holy Spirit if you want the Holy Spirit he has Deliverance if you want Deliverance he has everything if you want it faith if you want Faith said that if you don't have faith amen I believe man said that Lord have my unbelief amen if you don't have faith you can pray to God Amen because faith is a revelation amen you can pray for to God for a revelation and God will give it to you so if you need Revelation for your healing you can pray to God for Revelation for your healing God will give it to you Abraham did not have faith by himself God gave him that revelation of Amen so the same God who gave him that revelation to have to give him faith for that 25 years of waiting God will give you that same fa he's the same God who will give you that same Revelation had to ask for a son Abraham had to make his request known he said Lord listen here I am I'm getting old amen but I don't have an hair amen I don't have a son amen I need a son Abraham asked for it so if you believe that you are the Seed of Abraham through Jesus amen so you can also ask for what you want if your father asked for it amen and God gave him what he asked for so you can also ask for it and God will give you what you're asking for because he is the same God am he's not an he's not an historical God Amen why he didn't the past he's going to do it again amen the Bible gives keeps a record I believe of six women who did not who was Barren and God gave them children so if you find yourself in the same situation can your name will be under your name will be added to that record as well and people will be talking about you the way they're talking about Abraham but the Bible gives Bible keeps about the record of three times that that God had to divide the sea for his children to walk on dry land he did it with Moses he did it with Elijah he did it with elishah amen so if you find yourself in that same situation ask for it God will do it for you and you can add your name on on top of them amen there are numberous people being healed in the Bible amen if you need healing ask for it God will give you healing like we said it the other day the book of Acts is the only book in the New Testament that is not finished with an amen am which means that book is still still to be written amen you are the next writer of that book because your testimony will have to be in that book as well amen so how are you going to have it if you don't ask ask for it amen sometimes as a father I'm not a father yet but sometimes as a father I know it because I'm a child amen sometimes as a father I have my parents they will just give you something without asking for they just say well I thought about you and get this new suit and new shoes and whatever that's good amen I mean I'll receive the gift amen but Dad you know sometimes it's not really what I wanted amen but he will give me a gift I said thank you Dad and I will receive and I'll wear it for him to really give me what I want I have to go to him and said Dad I need money for my tuition amen and as my dad even though he doesn't have it he's going to work hard in order for him to give it to me amen sometimes God gives us with you know things the difference is when when God gives you something you really need it sometimes you just don't realize it but you really do need it but there are times that there are things that you want to have amen you have to go to ask you have to go ask him amen he died on the cross amen the bible say that he render the curtain Amen to give you that free way that free path to go to the holies of holies and to make your supplications known amen and that's done by prayer Amen in prayer you don't always have to close your eyes to pray amen it doesn't have to be a one hour prayer though it's good but sometimes you're walking and you're driving amen you feel a strong desire to pray for your brother just speak the word amen it happens to me so many times amen that I know that I'm going to get in trouble amen I will run I know that my dad has a curfew that he set amen I know that I'm going to get in trouble but I would just Express the Lord please just this time don't let me get in trouble and I will go home and nothing will happen happened I was a kid back then it wasn't just vain prayers even though I didn't know the importance of what I was saying but with that faith of a child amen I wanted that so bad that I didn't want to get in trouble amen and I was going to say I was going to just make a request to God Amen I wasn't closing my eyes amen it wasn't long pray just a single request Lord please don't let this happen Lord I want this and that and that will happen amen he's the same God who can do it for you this amen so whatever you have tell him amen talk to him amen have a conversation with him he's going to give it to you Amen in closing amen I want to read this prayer of brother brand amen then we can call musicians coming give us a song Amen it's found in the god who's rich in Mercy paragraph 24 and 25 am my brother Bram is praying and it says he says dear Jesus

your needs are amen God is more powerful to give it to you God is more than able to Grant it to you whatever your need is amen it doesn't matter how small and how great how big that need is amen it doesn't matter how impossible that need may be to you amen the Bible says that nothing is impossible to God and everything is possible to them that believe amen so if you believe amen you will put yourself in that case in that in that case that everything is possible to you amen Jesus gave his word and he didn't give it in vain amen he knew that one day you will come to him with the word he
