morning and and uh enjoyed the fellowship last night and the presence of the lord that came in amongst us and uh just got to talking with brother uh keith this morning out in the uh parking lot and just thinking about you know where keith i said something to you there about what i'd been through and i'm gonna switch okay you said it was what you were going through and i i tell you i i was thinking about how that we don't go through anything for no reason everything we go through is for a purpose we may never know what that purpose is but sometimes you see because you begin to tell someone else and then god will begin to reveal to you that it was all for that other person [Music] sometimes you you go through trouble with your children and it's all so that one day you can help someone else that's going through the same problems never doubt god you're going to be you can be seated for a moment with the sword for mom i'll i'll just share something with you that the lord's been dealing with me all right when i was a young man and seeking the baptism of the holy ghost lost and in my point of worry and so i just want to tell you this morning if you're worried if the devil has you torn up tormenting your mind just relax because any decision made in haste anything done in a hurry it's going to be the wrong decision look at the decision abraham he made a decision in haste yeah it produced a wild person it it produced we still have wars amen if we could let's turn to ephesians chapter two ephesians 2 verse 2. now we read this last night but i want to pick it up and go over it a little bit more among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others do not accomplish according to the prince of the power of the air now brother branham tells us that the prince of the power of the earth is the devil so we all walked the course of this world there's a direction that this world is going there's a direction that satan is taking the people we used to hear of crooked politics in other countries there's wars here there's rumors of wars here you see there's hatred here yeah it's the course of this world the word course means moving in a path from one point to another and this broad road of destruction sickness on every hand determines your destination determines but there's there's an opportunity an opportunity to make a u-turn there is an opportunity to turn around and go another direction and i want to thank god god [Music] the word course also means the way you conduct yourself you can tell by how someone acts videos what course they're on election if someone is if they have love in their heart they love their brother they pray they study the word the way and brother branham said that all of the other women that went to the king would dress in jewels and adorn themselves on and what they thought the king wanted it but the king had told one man what he wanted and brother branham said that esther only wore it that was told by god what he wanted that's the one that knows what the king wants and brother branham said esther if robert is there dressed in what he told her all we have to do is so all you have tells me you're headed to the kingdom so there was a lady that had a dream about brother branham and brother branham said he said i was saying a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway there was a lady came by and she had on these high-heeled shoes and she said i said wait a minute sister i don't mind sir you can't walk that highway with that avexula now i understand it wasn't that she couldn't walk but she couldn't walk that highway as i said last night this is it's another question brother bran uh a sister asked brother branham if a woman should wear jewelry she uh uh informed me yeah so brother brandon begins to tell if happened something small he said but when you see it's getting a hold of you the you can tell if something's getting a hold of someone i love the fish jumpy and sometimes fishing gets ahold of me i begin to think about it as i'm at work and i i go home and i sit shoes this amount whether it's our clothing whether it's our job a girlfriend boyfriend uh anything like that the control you said that what esther was dressed in this there was a meek and humble spirit brother around this message i don't see a lot of humility anymore humility people are lifted up now preachers are looking for popularity the predicate popularity they quit preaching holiness entity because they want to be popular i don't want to be popular there's only one man i want to please i want him to be pleased with me says who's adorning let it not be that of outward adorning and plaiting of hair and wearing of gold or putting on of apparel exterior consistency but let it be the hidden man of the heart is the way it's passed that lead us to destruction and many there be that go in iona now this what this broad the it's because he does not love you but if you have a pastor that preaches the straight and narrow he preaches how to live it's pastor appreciation month they thank him for preaching the truth sometimes it's tough it's difficult sometimes it hurts the philosophy like i said last night about the shepherd sometimes loves you he's not here for the money in a participle he's not here for a bunch of people he's not here for popularity thank god for pastors this is not a code of conduct this is not rules this is not law we're bringing you to life the reason we shouldn't have television is they give us more time in the word and the word is life when you understand that it's no longer [Music] says beware of false prophets a false prophet preaches falsehood he teaches things that aren't true but that's not what he meant right now in the world i think there's eight billion people i believe he got the right man and so when that man says it i lost it's the truth brother saying i don't have to question what's the problem but inwardly they are ravening wolves sir now this word ravening it means to gain by convincing in an argument you find people that love to argue the word watch out for that guy yeah there you find the spirit of christ a false prophet will do whatever it takes to get sounds good to me because a false prophet only wants to lift himself up but a man lift it up we'll bring you to destruction evolved [Music] you'll that's what brother adam had a vision of the bride and then he saw the vision of the church and brother branham said the church was dressed immorally and he said they were dancing to the beat of rock and roll you don't see urithmed you rock he did not say they were dancing to rock and roll they were dancing to the beat of rock and roll you rock and roll and around the message it sounds like rock and roll but it has gospel lyrics but that's what the church was marching to messi don't see and brother branham said i thought but he said it i saw one of them get out of step um [Music] and he said i begin to scream thank god for a prophet that would scream merciless thank god for a man that was crying out get back today let's get back inside me get back inside [Music] when we've it leads to destruction you might wonder this morning how do i change my course maybe you'll be honest enough to say i've been going the wrong direction you can and he changed the whole course the impossible happened maybe you're praying about something right now you want god to do something for you that seems impossible you say how can it happen take him at his word believe the word mary's choice brought jesus on the scene because she believed the words it brought jesus to the earth jesus i thought brother troy it's bringing jesus back on the earth christ in you the hope when the devil says it's impossible and you believe anyway you bring christ on the scene um brother branham tells about a little woman in memphis tennessee i looked up the timeline on that the other day you know why she just took god at his word i'm going to tell you if you've got a child you're praying for him and i know you are you take him out of his word she stood at the gate until her promise was manifested the scripture said having wesley suzanne wesley had 17 children and she didn't have an automatic washer or dryer machine she didn't turn on the faucet and get hot water she packed it from a spring in an old bucket he said but she found two to three hours every day to get those little felt those little children around and teach them the bible and from there came a charles and john who changed the course of the world charles johnson brother one insult person praying for two to three hours and bringing her children around to get into that word for one person change the course you can train up a child in the way it should go moving but when she came in contact she came in he'll straighten out that crooked life of yours if you're vowel and immoral he will make you as pure as a lily if you'll just take him at his word children's children and for them that are far off brother keith no matter how far they are grandpa he'll take him at his word it might not happen today that heals all that disease that's his word i know many people who had heart trouble god healed him cancer concern and god took it from him all kinds of sicknesses is nipple but he's a healer um get himself if he ever did it once she laughed he can do it again it can change the course of your life i want to i want to take a turn now john the revelator was on the isle of patmos and i want you to look at what was going on around him the course of the world was going on around him when john looked around he saw snakes and rats he saw murderers what changed his course yeah he heard a voice the same voice we heard in the days of the voice the scripture didn't say in the days of the seventh angel it said in the days of the voice and john was on the island and he heard a voice these things of but he churches christ himself descended with a shout out he ripped open the book he began to show us who said when these things happen wars rumors awards earthquakes in diverse places they said instead of thinking about how bad it's getting regarded think about how close the rapture is getting the worse it gets you can live above the things of the world people today say they're getting tired of hearing god sent without this word i'm walking in darkness but when the word comes turns the light on when the word comes it allows you to make a u-turn you can the word allows you to change your course and it's not you that changes it [Music] these were both earthbound creatures [Music] then he told us there was a man anointing still an earthbound creature but he said in this day and of culture and science and education education and modern stuff we will rise oh it looks hopeless oh i said something looks the bride of jesus christ and seize the everlasting prize we'll go through the air musa and this cc this is whatever you're going through right now this will be over your children that you're worried about this will be over your spouse that you're worried about it's the rapture see don't live more it's what the word came to do it took every one of us we were all shaped in sin um it changed our course would you stand your feet with me this morning you know the song changed my heart oh god change my heart oh god make it ever true with your heads bowed this morning would there be one that
