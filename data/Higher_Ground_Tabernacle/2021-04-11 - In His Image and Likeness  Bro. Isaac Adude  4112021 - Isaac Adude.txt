set genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27 genesis 17 the bible says and god said let us make let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over all and over all of the um all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is [Music] amen let's go over to philippians philippians chapter 2 we read the verse 5. philippians verse 5. the bible says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus christ so now here the prophet says that the mind that the mind that paul is talking about is actually the life and the character of jesus christ so in other words lest this character or this this life that was in jesus being new [Music] amen let's go to uh to our last verse uh last book of the bible let's turn into ii peter chapter 2 verse 21 to 27 25. 20. second peter no actually it's first peter i'm sorry um first peter 2 21-25 25. i got lost for a moment first peter 2 uh first peter 2 21-25 the bible says for even here unto where you where you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow who did no scene neither was found who when he was revealed revealed revealed not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to see should live should live unto righteousness by whose drafts he were healed but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of our souls dear heavenly father i'm shall we come before your presence and here we are father god in your lord jesus to thank you father so we want you to take the preeminence of the service lord from your blessings your name and your name only be exalted but we pray father god that you helped me for the lord your peace and uncle jimmy lord to be so sensitive to the holy spirit go wherever father god you want me to go yeah dear god i pray that you opened you you open our hearts so that we can hear it thank you pray for our pastor let your grace and mercy be with him lord at the end of the service father god bless you serve his spirit we will not miss to say thank you come on come on thank you father god for everything that you you already did for us thank you father god for the things that you are doing for us thank you father lord for the things that you will do for us jesus christ this morning i am i have a little subject that i wanted to talk about and it's in his image and his likeness in his image and his likeness that's an imagination you know i was inspired but uh the quotes brother brooks uh read uh on wednesday the week before eastern the jew was god expressing his own word through them because the hebrew children said our god is able to deliver us amen this this quote actually you know really inspired me to show my people you know i didn't stop thinking about this for the whole week and by god's grace we will build our uh um our sermon upon this one amen the book where uh in genesis chapter one where we read uh god is saying let us make men in our image and you know like after our likeness so that this man will have dominion over the fish of the sea this is this was actually the perfect image or the perfect man that god you know wanted us to be it's a city long perfect to juvenile you know this is what god this is what we have to be that's a school or the place that we have to reach london you know to be in the image of god unimaginable you know to have dominion over all the entire earth you know to reflect god reflected you to reflect his character because if you read the if you listen to the prophet in the message identification you will see that the prophet spent more time talking about the character of jesus you know that's why paul said that let this mind that was in jesus christ in other words let this character or just let this life that was in jesus be also in you character the very weight i mean the true way to see the character of jesus is in this bible in this word and my prayer is that so that in the entire church when they will be reading the bible you know they can see them themselves reflected it's a white women reflected in so that they can be the mirror the mirror of god you know the prophet gave this story of of this young man the prophet you know this young man i mean it was a little boy in his house they didn't have any mirror you know and then he saw something you know like you know he saw another boy well he said well let me go and then you know talk to this boss so that we can be friends yeah you know what i mean walking he was walking toward him and then he says that this boy this other boy was walking again toward him you know he tried to move in his right did i say dude you know what this other boy you know moved moved also you know he tried to make a funny face did i see the pharaoh you know the other boy who made the funny face he looked gasoline then after seeing all those after seeing that no he realized that that was his own image reflected and then you know my desire is to defeat the image of god so that when i'm walking wherever i am i work school and wherever people see me they can see christ the prophet says that these three men come to prophecy identify jesus and then and then jesus had to reflect himself in in them so when they were cast when they were cast into the fire you know the king who was outside you know was able to see god the fourth man they think about the voice why because they gave their life for christ now his own loving character molded himself into the person of christ [Music] god's own character of love projected himself in the man lukaku mem the thinking it not that we're thinking thinking in that robbery but making himself equal to god no one could ever do that by god this was done so that he could pay the penalty the of the fall of the fall of the fall of his creation amen he died so that we can have the character of jesus when he died upon the cross he said he gave us be like him no we'll make us walk like him will make us talk like him will make us behave like him because the prophet says that you can never reproach you can never report yours or reproduce this character the prophet you know unless you accept him i'm wonderful so in other words that you can never copy the character of jesus you know it's you doing the work you're doing your best to be the best image that you can ever be visited in nature you know it's no longer you doing the work you know even without knowing about people will be able to realize that this is like this is christ's life hey man i remember last semester i had i had a project my my school project that i had to do [Music] so at the end of my project i had to design let's say um because it was a chair that i had to do so here we have the chair uh this one is too simple it was you know a little more different so uh i had to design the the uh the the arm support here so the two the left the left part the left side and the right side were identical so i said well since they're identical so i don't have to design it twice or i don't have to make it to i mean do the so i said well let me copy and paste the right hand and then i will put it on the left hand side because you call the laptop so i ended up having two right hands instead of having the right and left because because even though they were identical but the right hand didn't fit in the place of the left hand you know when i you know because it was late i only had like 10 minutes to submit my in other words it will reflect the right hand as if you know in the left in the left position you will have the left hand and the right hand you know only if you do the mirror it's simple if you try to copy and paste and when they would try to put you in the right position you know if we try and copy everything if we're trying to copy or if we if we are the copy and paste product you're trying to confirm yourself into his image but instead if you are the mirror of god he will reflect himself in you and when you will be placed in that position in a manger could you imagine that could you imagine the little jehovah playing as a boy it's an example it's an example uh uh like it's an example this is an example could you imagine him as a teenager [Music] could you imagine him as a carpenter could you imagine him uh could you imagine him in such complete obedience or obedience to god dying on the ground you know jesus god himself god jesus no he had to make himself a baby baby you know being in a manger you know being marketed um you know being in a conference shop you know all of that to form or to show us the the true image of god if god came you know to us being a grown-up you know young people will have excuses but they say well god we never still we never saw you when you were young so we don't have the image of you being young you know that's why he had to start being a baby you know being a baby and growing up you know you really show us you really showed to us to show us you know the true image of god in every steps of our lives you know if you are young you can reflect yourself to him if you're old you can still reflect yourself tonight you know so that we can be this perfect image of god perfect you know god expressed himself in the scene god the god expressed himself in the sinless nature jesus extremely natural you know the way god expressed god always expressed himself in the sinless nature jesus christ remember you know that's why jesus was the true expression of g of god that's why he could say that me professor god is our savior if we profess that god is our deliverer if we profess that god is our hero you know we have to have this nature reflecting us you know we have to have you know the the nature of god reflect the being reflecting us you know like moses you know what and whenever moses was going to the mountain why because god was reflecting himself through him you know it was impossible for them to see god you know that's why they couldn't see the face of moses his face was so shining you know he was he was he had to wear himself you know and my desire is that god i just want to be your image but we have to take in another step higher yeah he was talking to me say isaac do you know um you say isaac you know actually you are the most used the word religious but um but he said that isaac you are the most religious person here in this uh i mean this uh uh i mean where we work here yeah he's actually religious you know and then i said to myself i said lord jesus you know i thank you for this testimony but i will be satisfied until those people will be able to thirst you know and be hungry and you know looking for what i have yeah what fun that was crochet you know they can't notice that i'm different thank you for that but my purpose is to make them thirsty i can the bible says that rejoice matthew chapter 5 verse 12 to 16. says okay matthew chapter 5 verse 12 to 16 the bible says rejoice and be exceeding glad for for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted day the prophets which were are before you vote you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savior wherewith shall it be salted it is danced for it did dance forth that good for nothing but not but to be cast out and to be true and to be trodden under under uh under foot of men you are the light of the world a city that is set on the hill cannot be heat situation neither do men light a candle and put it under the bushel under a bushel but on the candlestick and it gives light onto uh unto all that are in the house solutions let your light so shine before man that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven and glorify your father which is in heaven kid on this year you know that's the same thing that the king did celebrate you know the king nebuchadnezzar that's the same thing he did the one he became you know after the came that the king came near to the mouth to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and the prince's governors and captains and the king's counselors being gathered together so this man upon whose bad is the fire had no power nor in hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of the fire pass on them somebody and said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god expect except their own god solution therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything amid uh uh which speak anything and miss against the god against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and there and their houses shall be made a dunk here because there is no other god then that that can't deliver after this the prophet said that they left their home they left at their house when they were 12. you know the prophet said that they had no bible with him the prophet you know the prophet even emphasized he said that he didn't have even this song book that we do here the only thing that they knew was the word was the uh the word of moses is you know that's the only thing that they have you know to stand before that great challenge and the quotes that we just read in the first quote that we read the prophet said that they stand for they stood for something that they didn't have a revelation of it for something that they didn't have no revelation for it but they weren't able to stand you know they even said to themselves you know even though we are burned you know we will never bow and worship this guy right with your image you know but when they were doing that they didn't have or they didn't know what what that you know what uh what their life will have an impact on the impact of their lives [Music] with the word they obey the word of moses that says that you will never have another god before me is you know change the law of the country saying that i don't want you i don't want anybody to talk against this god because i had my personal time i tried to think about my god you know everything that i thought that they do i try to compare all their works but i didn't see them doing the works that the god of these three hebrews children did you know the fire that was hit up you know seven times harder than it was the foot is set for pluto you know the fire that killed the two guards that was that was standing at the door you know but the king tried to search you know he looked you know he tried to search who can do the same thing he said that from now you know i need you all to you know to go and worship this same god you know and if you can if you read the next chapter you will see that the same king you are telling the word you know to change the the heart of the king amen and that's the same thing that god is looking for you know god is looking for somebody you shall get gone you know who can take this word keep you know the challenges will come the devil will always come to challenge you you know the devil will always give you we always give you more tests you know we will always give you more trials but god is looking for that man can come you know he will be able to stand and to stick with this word you know never you know sell it for something you know and then and then stand for it and god will god will always honor you you know god will always harm you you know jesus came on earth you know so you know so that we can follow his footsteps you know and when he went there when when he uh uh uh uh he died in rapture you know he sent us the holy spirit and the holy spirit inside of the people instead of people it wasn't expanding you know we're able to write this book of acts you know the same god remember because if you read the bible you know that's what the bible says but the same god may remember because he uh most of his miracles before his brothers that's why even he even said to that woman you know to do the same thing to have the ministry of of the son of man you know he wasn't the son of man god was the son of man you know reflecting living inside of him the son of man is you know some things that the prophet did lost you see that many people always you know you know give it back to the prophet usually well i agree that there are you know certain things that only the prophet can do you know for example you're giving your back to the people and telling the thought of everybody for example you know that that that's only one gift of of the age but but he gave us god gave god give us the grace you know to see those works the voices over so that has you know so that you know to be uh to see those works so that when the prophet is gone the prophet you know we'll be able to do the same work this wrong that completely remembers you write the book of acts you know and that is the same thing you know god said god had murder god sent as a prophet judas prophet you know that prophet was the image of god it's a prophetic image of jesus that prophet [Music] i had a conversation with one brother you know but we we told him i think it was me and lisa and we were talking with another brother you know that brother actually came to us and he says only the prophet can raise up you know a dead for a dead man you know he said that that was only for the prophet only the prophet can do this the fair well i said well there is nowhere in the bible where he says that only the prophet can do it you know the prophet tell myself i never i you know god never you know didn't give me the grace to do it on call during that you know but i still believe that if you know it happens and we know and god gives me the grace to do it i will do it and that person will be that person will rise up you know why because it was something you know it was something you know that god show it to us oh god gave it to us you know the prophet says the prophet now the only way that the world will see christ is when he is when uh uh they see it in you and me the son of mondo that's the only way they ever see christ it says that their conscience are now or not of of the sunsets that we that we enjoy after after we have found christine you are god's so we don't want to smear we don't want to smear a big a big lot of stuff on there that testifies about things that we're really not that we are we really are not you know there are other people who will never have this chance to open this bible you know there are other people who will never have the chance to read the word from this bible we have no excuses to say that they didn't know the words you know the bible said that we are the written epistle read about all men you know others people will never they don't have this chance or this opportunity to open this bible yes because remember the prophet says that god wrote his word or his word in five things in five different ways written bible and we have to live like it is no we have to live like you know wherever that we go you know we want people to see that we are different that you know we are living the life of christ you know we want people when they look at us they can see yes ma i went you know i remember one day i went to a sunday school you know that made me remember of that crash that i heard about like this man he told me that you know if if there are any you know religious people here at work no there is none like you know if there are religious which i don't think you know that that's what they say which i don't think that they are because they wouldn't be doing what they are doing my life was able to reflect the image of christ amen and that's where we all have to be you know that's our desire that's my desire i said lord help me father to be to be just like you yes you know and you have to know one thing that your influence never dies you know you're living your best to live like christ and you see you think that there is no feedback you know there is no miracle yeah miraculous you know there is no uh uh uh people you know there is no one telling you that you know i was influenced by you or you know other other testimonies that you can have the prophet said that stephen never made you know he didn't have he didn't have no miracle he didn't do any miracles you know though he was serving a miracle god emmc itself himself didn't do any miracles but his life you know was in his life influenced somebody sevilla you know that stephen you know kept his faith you know until he died you know his life influenced somebody sevilla you know even even though at that at that same time that person was not changed personally by day by days after melissa you know his life was able to influence and to change paul saville take of of of souls to christ you know damage the thousands of soul for christ the the the media damn you know because he was influenced by a man who thought you know himself he thought that his life was so little you know he did he wasn't important you know you know because he didn't do any miracles you know if we try to compare it with peter you know peter had me peter did a lot of miracles you know uh he made the lamb walk you know the angel of the angel showed up when he was in prison you know he had all those all those kinds of miracles but this young man stephen you know he didn't have any miracle he didn't do any miracle at all but he lived such a life you know that that was reflecting the life of christ i even chose to die for christ was able to change the life of a person the life of a man that's what the christian has to have to do today you know to live to serve the same god that you are serving amen and and the prophet says what are we to do today because we want some neutral do we no matter he said that we don't have to have big audiences you know we don't have to preach to 10 000 people [Music] we don't have to uh we we we we don't even have to preach that's it we can be god's advertising advertisement board how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel certainly see old woman the farmer the farmers you know your life can start a young man vote for some young men on the field out there you know who will win 10 000 souls to christ [Music] you know it's because they saw christ in you that you presented christ to him in the simple power of the gospel or in other words you will present them christ in the simple power of the gospel by living your life you know the prophet says the prophet to judy that god wants to save people you know he called a lot of people but the thing is that the people who are supposed to be his billboards is that shows exactly your need you need to eat you will look for a billboard that says restaurants you need to fill up your tank you will look for this big billboard that says gas station and the prophet says that god called many people you know they are living the same way as as uh as non-believers they're singing the same song you know they they're going to the same parties yvonne of the memphis you know they're doing the same the exact same thing if only you know they are you know among those who market christ you know there is no difference between them and [Music] and instead of seeing a billboard that says that crust is here you know he's saying he's seeing another billboard that says that if you need you know entertainment come and call me and i'll help you know they're seeing something else you know that's not what you were called to do that's not what you that's not your purpose of being here on earth objective you know objectives you know the bible says that you are the light of the world and jesus is the main light how are you going to be the light of the world if your life is different than him you know you only reflect the person who is inside of you and the prophet says that inside of us there is only two things there is either a dove or a snake yes you i'm going to ask you a question that i i heard the prophet asking to abraham tabernacle you know the prophet asks is the church the prophet he that he said says with the same life that you are living today or like just how you are now if you were in the time of noah you know if you were you know if you were in the time of noah you know which group or in what group were you going to be where are you going to be with noah or were you going to be with other people who rejected they will reject the word you know all of that the answer is by the way you're living you know i'm not here to tell you that you're living wrong or you're living right you know each one of us are conscious you know even those people who are not believers you know they know what is wrong and they know what is right what is right you know what about you i'll come before you who have been coming to church every sunday you've been in all the youth meetings you know you're supposed to know what is right and what is wrong and the very same way that you're living you know you can if you are true to god you know you would tell him lord i'm not yet what i want to be oh you said that lord i'm being a bad reproach for your name and and one thing i like with god he [Music] you know his life or his his image will be natural no he will reflect himself in you and you can walk it will be and people will say that this is quite this is like christ that's you know was i going to be with noah or with other people who rejected the word we know the result of those two groups no the people were with noah you know they were saved is it this will be you know they were saved by the people who were not with noah all of them was killed even now you know all of them was here and which group do you want to be educated there is only two no there is god's people the jews and the people of the day of lucifer and there is only two there's only one thing that you can do to be a part of one group you have to accept either one of them you know the prophet says that to go to hell it's hard because you have to press your way here you have to do a big effort to go to hell basically physically you know you have to step on the prayer of your parents step when you pray you the prayer of your parents you know you have to reject the word you know you have to do all kinds of stuff to go to hell there's only one thing that you can do no you only have to accept him as your craft as your savior and as your christ and your savior you know that's the only thing that you can do see the social skills you know to surrender yourself you know you're asking about why you know i'm not yet delivered with this scene or this you know bad habit you know because you're not fully surrendered you know why must you struggling with this because you know i prayed so many times but i'm still surrounded i'm still struggling with this fighting with this continually you know because you're not fully surrendered if you can surrender your life you know was billy paul was the uh the son of the prophet you know he had to choose his life when he was young you know the prophet told him to you know to put his hands like this like a cross the prophet told him that he was standing right here in the middle and this way was bringing him to hell and this other way was bringing him to heaven so he had to choose which one to go in but as a young man he chose to go to the other way to the opposite way from heaven you know our parents claimed us you know if we if we choose to go this way that brings to hell you know god in some way god will have to meet us and he has to bring us back surgery you know the day of you know in kappa we had to have a surgery in couple hours then he was sleeping and then he felt somebody touching his shoulders you know the prophet told him that i cannot heal you because i didn't see you the one who sinned the prophet christ as your as your savior and god right now you know he gave his life to christ right there at the bed of the hospital christopher julian you god will change you god will give you the victory jews are called the arabic god will make you a new man you know that your friends were one with uh we asked you that what had happened to you if you know to be the image of god that would imagine did you you know he created us in his image in his likeness you know to do one work you know to to you know to give to present christ to other people but are you doing that work you know you can still do it jesus had to tell his disciples you know before you go be my witness or you know you have to meet this god person you have to have your personal experience has to become personal to you you know you don't you know
