key bori is worthy [Music] [Music] one day into the chamber into the chamber we gently and I close Luva kind of is all amen thank God for His grace and His mercy amen surely God is good to us and we thank God for His goodness his grace and His mercy we are a creature that has been given so much grace it just seems like the word hallelujah is not even appropriate to praise God with I'm sure when we get over there he's gonna give us another word it has to do now for now but I think that when the Redeem of the Lord goes marching it's going to be a glorious time I think about Amazing Grace that song throughout eternity you will never fade it will always mean something to those who have been redeemed you and I have a lot to be thankful for we could have been born in a different age out of this instead of this age but God saw something that he in us that even our eyes cannot see he chose the best for last it's quite difficult to see yourself as the best but it is true when you think about those who have given their lives to be martyrs yet they were not equipped or designed for this age they wouldn't have made it our age is the most difficult age of all ages like brother branham said all the other ages before us knew their enemy my enemy is easy living easy living stops you from praying you easy living stop you from fasting easy living stop people from paying tithing and offering easy living it's killing a lot of Christians but we are grateful because we can keep our eyes focus to realize it's not by power nor by might but by the Spirit of the Lord Jesus I have a lot to say I thought that my brother Jarrett was coming in he was but the I won't say the enemy just forgot he had another appointment so he wasn't able to come this evening but we and he and I spent hours today really discussing the word he was so excited about coming to church tonight but nevertheless the next time if the Lord I pray that you would pray with me that God would open his understanding and her understanding the father down the road with them than we were before so I just know one thing I just believe that he's one of us elected and chosen by God just because some of the things that he had said in our discussion as we turn let us turn to Chronicles 1st chronicles please 1:19 first chronicles 1:19 then return to Genesis 11 one through nine Brooke first Chronicles 119 you know God is so so powerful and unto Eber were born two sons the name of one was Peleg because in his days the earth was divided and his brother's name with Joplin okay I'll leave it there Genesis now increase Genesis 9 beginning at the 16th verse 17 I'm sorry Genesis 11 please forgive me Genesis 11 1 through 9 and the whole earth was a one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar or Shina and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortal and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach it to heaven and let us make a stone a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built it and the Lord said Behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they began to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore it is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you Lord Jesus for breaking and destroying the yokes of the we thank you for being the piece giver Lord we thank you for being a hard fixer and mind regulator we thank you for being the comforter there is none like you or God and we pray Lord that's evening that you would have dine on way and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we thank God for his the beauty of his word I was thinking and I know the scripture text may seem a little strange to you tonight and when when I tell you what the subject matter is what time is it what time is it and I really believe I can say that the time is now we know by God's grace and according to the Word of God that when God created the earth the earth or the landmass was one now we know by science science says that they call it the continental drift and God calls it peel egg it was the name God had given this young man because his name means division and his brother's name Jacquin means small dispute and contention so I went back to Genesis and I thought about how men even to this day are trying to unite in such a way that they can outsmart God because that's exactly what Nimrod wanted to do he thought that he could outsmart God by building a temple or building a building and that building a men reached into heaven and you say well what I mean why would God be so concerned because you got to understand these people were very skillful a lot of time people think that these people in that day care at clubs and you know just really backwards but brother Branham said they were very intelligent people you got it you gotta be understand that these people were right after the fall you and I must understand that even during that time people grew bigger and they last and live longer I guess in the days of Noah we find out that these people thought that they were they could continue on in the way in which they were living and God of heaven was going to do nothing about it they forgot that God had judged Adam and Eve for just one sin they must have forgotten that God had taken out and eat out of the garden and because of their sin that's why they were the way they were living and so I got to the place they just start they had it all together God brought Norlin Noah on the scene that's what I love about God God he always comes at a time when you least expect him and he's always hiding himself he had those people understood that that wasn't the message in note in which Noah preached was in his own message and had they known that that was God in MO and Noah preaching they would have listened but God always veils himself he veils himself so he could confound the wise all right so you you you and I must understand that after the flood and you know men began to increase and go on in the way they did they thought well we're not let this happen again but remember if they had only known the scripture had only known what God had promised nor God had already told no it was going to never rain in such a way again Genesis the ninth chapter beginning at the 16th verse and the bow shall be in the clouds and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth and God said unto Noah this is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth but because they didn't know what God has spoken to Noah all of that building was in vain you see even you take what they're trying to do tonight or even in our day you you know they're trying to establish what we call a wormhole establish some way of connecting with the next dimension they know they exist see because they can't explain these phenomenons how people can be seen and not seen they have a record how things come through our our dimension and then disappear they know these things exist so they are curious of how to get there and you and I have the answer there is a way of getting there and that is through the blood of the Lamb see because you got to realize that there was a time that heaven and earth were not divided they will connect it Adam woke up a man at the sound of the angelic voices Adam didn't have to pray a man to hear God's voice the Bible said everything every evening God walked in the cool of the evening and they had a conversation they had a fellowship why because there was no breach but we find out that man has always tried to build himself up to heaven is that right it is called Babylon it has seemed like right now Amen that people are becoming coming to a place to realize hey man that well I tell you what what they do is dismiss heaven now they dismissed the rapture they said they dismissed these things and believe it they dismiss these things that it won't happen they think that this Bible is some kind of fairy tale or some kind of myth they really believe that we made God but that's what intelligence are telling them but we didn't make God God made us everything that God has designed cannot perish it can't falter whatever God says that's what it means and the Bible says that the grounds were with us and the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord it doesn't matter how long it takes to come to pass God will interpret his own word they may laugh even as they laughed at Noah and said Noah you're insane you know something's wrong with you it's never rained before and they had no idea that they were going to be the one that would cause the rain just like it all day they can't in fathom they can't fathom the world burning amen and and literally going up an explosion I mean it can't it can't it can't happen this way so they invent things in their minds how the world is going to come to an end when the Bible has already told us how it's going to come to an end hallelujah and it took us a prophet a prophet came back and told us amen it was man who caused the slide and if it was man who caused the flood it will be man who would cause the fire we understand that we're living in the age of destruction the spirit of instruction is everywhere hallelujah and every nation see me right on on the button who's gonna push it first I was talking with brother Craig and he was really excited about this uh North Korea fella and and and and and Trump coming together he said brother books do you realize what this mean he said that's probably the only country that we know of Amen that you can't get in there somewhere to preach the word and the Bible said that the bride will come from every nation he said I'm waiting as soon as that door opened I'm in there why he said because I feel that leadership I feel that anointing to go in because he said the door may not last long and I was so excited because I thought to myself that's right with one more step closer to the rapture hallelujah because you've got to realize hey man and those of us who were down there and in Iowa City you know confusion was in one of the messages but the Bible is right the message is right hallelujah amen but you and I must understand brother Branham said like this he said if a man has a true mount Transfiguration experience he can only worship the Lord Jesus Christ I got more than one quote on that hallelujah and man and might might need my word the word says neither is there salvation in any other there is no other name given under heaven whereby men must be saved that is the name of Jesus Christ so everything under heaven now when we get ready to go up the name will be changed hallelujah but we won't need a name change until that time y'all hear me until this Pentecostal feast is over you understand me and the Pentecostal feasts amen came after the atonement right when the trumpets were brought and then that trumpet was gathering the people together remember hey man when we talk about Jesus coming into Jerusalem you got to understand at the atonement the sound was gathered and they were there for the toll meant hallelujah and in that atonement came riding on a donkey hallelujah amen it was there amen the sacrifice was made but fifty days afterwards 7/7 after that that started the Pentecostal feast hallelujah and Peter preached the first sermon hallelujah and he ended his message with repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and that same name is the only name that this age will end up with you say what do you mean because once the Pentecostal feast is over the seven trumpets like brothers and those seven trumpets a mensch rounded amen during the six are under our sixth seal hallelujah but once that Pentecostal feast is over Amen we're now will be raptured that's why he said the Feast of the trumpet he said that is for the Jews but I'm gonna bill you all the way up so you can see where you're standing hallelujah because once we understand that those seven thunders are no seven seals Amen sounded under the sixth seal that means by the grace of God Amen when they reached their Pentecostal they are told it will go and you know what this trumpet is calling us to this Sunday what is calling us to to a rapture it is a gathering of the people and that's what we're gathered to you know he must understand this this thing is so simple it's so real we can't make it complicated hallelujah and we know by God's grace he is the god of him all Fame hallelujah by God's grace God in every age put on a mask hallelujah in the everson stage he had the master who Paul Paul said there were people among him who even thought he was God that give their life for him he said Paul said some of you even thought I was Jesus Christ himself you wouldn't even prompt your eyes out for me that's what he said he said some of you say I am appalled he said some of you say I am ever Cephas he said but I tell you this I died for nobody hallelujah how in the world can paul bv God hallelujah in Paul said I want to know him hallelujah I want to know him in the power of his resurrection and his suffering so understand this God who is in Martha he's no longer wearing the mass of William Branham but he's mad wearing the mass of the bride hallelujah it's the truth and you know I must understand that's not being disrespectful to brother Branham that's being respectful brother Browne said when you make me a god when you look at me like that you are now making me an antichrist hallelujah but you got those people see if you got the Holy Ghost like I was telling the brothers down in in Iowa City if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have enough discernment to know what was being said that's by a lot of people hiding man because they didn't catch it but see I don't understand French but he does and I knew something was wrong hmm that's what people don't understand you know I look at these things and I said it's okay I thank God for what happened I'm not discouraged and I think God would happen because now I know for certain who I am and who they are you won't understand all that I'm saying but nevertheless God knows right you and I must understand this thing is so fine line it's a hairline and oh listen how can anybody inin in here say I am up william branham you have a different spirit if that's what you think you have no no no no no I got the Holy Ghost you said prove that what are you saying why are you saying these things I'm hoping it's recorded and I'm hoping somebody gonna listen to my response hardly new because you see what happened is brother bellum went behind the curtain of time and he saw millions running to him and he asked the angel are all of these branham's and the angel said no they are not branham's they are converse to Christ Nereus so I am of Christ that's what has been the issue in this message who gives it a reproach y'all remember people came in here trying to tell me what a new name is and I caught it in the spirit the new name of Jesus Jesus Christ is what Jesus Christ he no other name given among men we don't baptize his his name you see the pressure of the whole thing is this Babylon it is a mess of confusion and that same spirit has moved up not in the message can't be in the message but among the message you understand me and they put the pressure on us to bow down to the image of a prophet that's why brother Branham brought out that the image that they make the King wanted him to bow down to was the image of Daniel and not even Daniel would bow to the image hallelujah and you find in the book of Revelation Amen when John went down to bow before the angel the seventh angel he said get up from there I am your brother my servant right I'm a brother amen you worship God I believe with all my heart that angel was brother Branham I can't help it to worship the Lord Jesus if that put me out of the message in them out hallelujah but one thing I do know we're living in a time where everybody's trying to unite and only the true bride of Jesus Christ is going to announce right unite you know who she's gonna unite with those who really believe that her husband their husband is no other than the person of Jesus Christ hallelujah Rebecca didn't remarry Eloisa hallelujah Rebecca Mayer Isaac but Eleazar was an announcer he was the one who was bringing Rebecca to Isaac was it God in him God in him God in you God in me was God and Moses yes was God in Joshua yes was God in David yes and you won't make it to heaven if God ain't in you you and I must understand this is the hour now that you and I must girdle up the laws of our minds and be SOVA right see you and I must understand when those trumpet sounds good brother Babel said that's why God would not allow him to preach the trumpets because he had already preached the trumpets when he preached the seven seals is that a quote that's what he said so he said understand when those trumpets sounded he said every last one of them sounded under what we call our sixth seal hallelujah because he said those copies were sounding amen to bring them back to the atonement now watch this because I want you to understand where we are because if we're there at the Pentecostal feasts as soon as our Pentecostal thisis over as soon as that last one come in we take a rapture and the two proper now revealed to Israel hallelujah you said what do you mean he said brother Balaam said like this he said Moses and Elijah was that sixth seal hallelujah and the mystery behind the seventh seal was William Penn nobody ever knew that will be a Gentile prophet major profit hallelujah this property you may not agree with me but he was more greater than Moses hallelujah he was greater than Elijah though he represents the spirit of Elijah who who see how I might get in trouble with this but I'm gonna tell you something though there was a time there was a prophecy that went out in the service that Moses Elijah and Jesus would be in the service you think oh come on somebody what was it God coming down veiling himself hallelujah in a little Kentuckian kind of like Noah nobody want to pay me attention you say well who was that brother Brooks it was telling him it was God right but mimicked many times brother Branham he had the Holy Spirit you know he did right but there were times when he Elohim would step directly in him and there were times and then he didn't even know what he was saying he had to go back to here to take himself now my point is if he was telling him how come he didn't remember what he said he was a foul so being used hallelujah and you and I must understand by God's grace it meant that God is in Martha that's what he is in marseilles he can change the mess whenever he wants to but listen because I put coke in a bottle that means the bottle is coke hallelujah Amen it's the substance that's in the bottle this is what he says yes yes let me tell you something one of the greatest if you want to see what time of year it is look on the calendar if you want to see what time of night it is look on the clock if you want to see what day you're living in look where the Jews are God's timepiece and look the very night the very day the angel of the Lord met me 1946 on may 17 hope you all know what may 17 mean did you know that may 17 was also at the same time that Noah went into the ark the second month the seventeenth day of the Jewish calendar it would be our May 17 and God comes right here oh come on somebody and you look at you say well what do you mean listen God don't do anything just to be doing it there's a purpose behind it hallelujah why because there is all the lapping of something here God is getting ready to bring forth Moses and Elijah and the Pentecostal feast our feast is almost over Alleluia and then when when what what what did this call what did this thing call us from just like if you study uh uh Egypt and Moses and all of the things that took place you're going to find out that the same kind of Exodus they had we're happening but in the spiritual realm hallelujah and when we leave out of here guess what we put the atonement on the doorpost in the little that right that means you've got to die to yourself hallelujah when you cost you the see oh but on the other side there's a feast going on there's a shouting or no there's a praising going on and you and I must understand this is where where the Bible got us now we're right at it folks is closer than you think hallelujah why because even now I just heard the other day that Israel is to the training temple guards I think I heard that from brother rich and my thing is why why did they take him in a corn and they put Trump on there Trump Trump Trump the last Trump and then they put Trump on one side and they put Cyrus on the other King Cyrus why because King Cyrus and Trump are doing the same thing the Alpha has become the Omega then literally he said go back home and build a temple go back home so you can get your your house in order and start this thing all over again and that's exactly what Trump is doing hallelujah and if they are building and preparing for this great thing to happen why do you think Moses and Elijah is there's one place brother man said they'll be transplanted I don't know but if they were transplanted on Mount Transfiguration they could be transplanted in Jerusalem they've been there before hallelujah and then at the second time I don't know which it is it's also he they could be living there right now I remember when my wife and I went to Jerusalem in here 2000 I said Lord let me give a church a book to some Jew that will really appreciate it hallelujah and I gave a church a book to our our tour guide and she said oh brother branham like she learned him before and she just started reading it right being thanking us for it now I don't know what that book is to this day but you never know hallelujah i sat there with these Jews and I'm telling you they spiritual amen and this uh-huh I can't remember his name I sent with him he's one of the lay men over the Temple Mount he literally fought in the six-day war I was there with him sitting there and all of a sudden he's is all he says there's seven ministers in here he says God getting ready to do something seven gave me some tip amount dirt and all that stuff and got it to this day hallelujah now you say nothing to that but I'm gonna tell you something amen that God is so real this man said to us any bit school in the and all of us he said you guys are more spiritual than what we are he said if I hadn't known that there was a war going on like that like this one he said I would have never showed up and I told Eddie biscuit not to even come but he said God told him to come and he came and then when they saw our women I saw our women dress and everything else he was just blown away they took us in Israel's army where they don't let people go in showed us and come to us and showed us things that they don't normally let people see we actually went into the the Temple Mount where the Muslims don't even know that they got places that you can going on in under this but my point is this we can be slothful if we want to but those people are zealous they believe that Messiah is coming hallelujah no matter how many times and you can't stop them now now that Jerusalem has been renamed the Capitol you can't stop them now if you want revival that's where you need to go right now hallelujah because those people are on fire because they know that their Messiah is soon to come hallelujah we don't understand this thing is closer than we think brother BAM said in World War one but World War one do World War one loose those two hundred thousand and demons whatever they are those demons that look like horses and got tails like snakes and all that kind of stuff you know and he said listen he said there's not two hundred demons in the world horses in the world he said these were supernatural charges and what would they do what would they loose for they will lose amen on the Jews and they were loose on the bride what do you think fights you every day chargers demon power amen that fault amen in the end eluvian time that was bound in the river Euphrates that's why you see all the adventures amen because it proves that the world before was far more intelligent than what we are telling the brothers I said why do people think that these people in the days of Noah amen had clothes and stuff like that I say they don't understand that these people in the days of Noah built a pyramid and I said what people say well they'd rather believe that some alien came from some planet and gave us this education had to believe the Bible I'd like to ask one of those scientists how in the world did Noah builded Ark he meant a survivor flood uh what to call it um apocalypse and it still partially sets up on the Mount Ararat hallelujah when the greater a greater man amen supposedly then Noah built what they call the Titanic and is still at the bottom one lake and it got down right st. and later we're right at the end of this thing revelation 9 13 12 13 to 14 cents and the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates and you got to understand by God's grace had not God stopped World War 1 we wouldn't be here today eleventh hour 11th minute 11 second leaven month whatever that's when it stopped and nobody to this day know why it stopped hallelujah the Bible says stop it right now ah because I haven't sealed the servants of God in their foreheads there's a ceiling that gasps it has to come on hallelujah and we're not the servants Israel is a service there's another ceiling at the gold hallelujah but in between them there's a bride called out is that right said Amen we are the wild olive branch we're the wild olive the jews were blinded on purpose but now that you see that watch is real that's your calendar the eyes beginning to open hallelujah oh come on somebody and remember that atonement that feasts that they're going to have is not a feast of shouting it is a feast of mourning he's gonna wee-wee where did you get those scars they were laughs he was saying in the in the house of my friends then they'll be able to see Jesus Christ why because brother Branham said he's Moses and Elijah were preached the same message he preached is that the truth they have to if he had to preach what Paul preached they gotta preach what he preached there's only one way to heaven hallelujah listen revellings a knife chopping and 13 versions now notice real close under the sixth trumpet remember in 1913 he said under the sixth trumpet note there was 200,000 Horseman's that had been bound in the river euphrates was turned loose under the sixth seal trump excuse me now there's not a hundred thousand Horseman's in the world but there was two hundred thousand horsemen snows was he said I want you to jot it down so you can read it there wasn't natural horses they breathe fire they had breastplates of Jasper they had black tails and the end of the tail looked like a serpent and the snake head on the end of it stinging see it was spiritual horses spiritual Devils charges that have been bound in the Euphrates all these years supernatural Devils what was it the old Roman Empire being revived the persecution of the Jews right and you and I we look about was Ohio listen we know that there was an anointing of a woman who took the Bible out of school to buy a lot of it and after a while the church is going to deny the Bible they gonna call it obsolete you said no way yeah they already got the new revised version what's next if you're gonna deny a few words you're gonna deny all eventually and what you gonna do with that see what I'm saying but you and I must understand God is the word and the word is God ah you said what brother books I can't be wrong I've been taught this all my life well that's why the Jews are still in behind that's why the Muslims are blind that's why all of these other religions are blind because people have been taught how to be blind but there shall be like Alleluia they would turn loose on the Jews huh the persecution of the Jews supernatural devil and you and I never thought about it right but the only man can't do that man is bad but he can't do what these demons had him doing to the Jews now this was something supernatural it was it was such a a persuasion it was such a possession y'all hear what I'm saying and you and I must understand that's exactly what the devil is trying to do to the saints of God his whole desire is to possess you because once he possess you he can get you to do whatever he wants you to do not tomorrow now and he gets us by easy living hallelujah listen super I know I got you as friend said when they were they were in that war they didn't even lot of them didn't even know what Hitler was doing when they came out of that war and saw what Hitler had done they were not only shocked but many of them were a shame ah they were under the influence no let me tell you something that's why it's so important to preach it right because if you don't beat your right you get under that influence you become blind thinking that you see huh who was the first preacher he comes right down he preached to the angels for us he come right down and preached the same message to eat you got a will you can decide what you want to do hallelujah oh my your will need to be this not my wheel but let thine be done outside of that you ain't got a thought coming this what people don't understand this thing this message is the greatest thing that ever hit the earth hallelujah and you got to understand you have to have the whole ego at least a measure of disarmament of something Amen to know when you hear something that's twisted that's all I did twist I caught it didn't know what was being said and I asked some of the brothers later some didn't want to tell me what was being said sometimes you have to act a little we'll never usually wisdom like you already know then when you have like you already know they start telling you stuff hallelujah but one thing for sure that evening service hallelujah the true believers was there one brother one brother said god bless you brother god bless you but no fussing but no fighting it came sweet my god ah they turn loose to the Jews the persecutors the Jews supernatural Devils nearly 2000 years then loosed by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews huh so who lost them Stalin Hitler and Mussolini and therefore there will be another man that's going to lose it these same demons on the foolish virgin oh he'll lose them on us but when he does we go up I'm tired of these old Christian oh praise the Lord I'm so glad you are when you get tired of us he wanted kids listen that's the truth they all the devil has always tried to stop the royal seed look throughout history of the Bible when they came for Jesus and you appeared and got him up out of there when it came for Moses an angel came and got him out of there hallelujah oh my and just like God did yesterday here do the same today when it's time to go we're gonna know it why because he said you're children of the light he will not catch you like a thief hallelujah Oh Lord he said Oh Lord I'm so bad that's one thing I like about the brother he preached that message about the loaf with the unleavened bread is 11:11 and then 11 hallelujah that's the victory of God right now but God can take himself and take that which is leaven and take the liver now hmm what do you think the cares of Christ's doing to you you don't remain 11 God comes that created power of the Holy Ghost comes in you and began to create Christ in you hallelujah the leaven is if I say anything is this ocean for flesh hallelujah but the Bible said on the moment of the tweaking Allah God is going to change is that Bible the Bible said no weapon formed against you shall prosper and not only that it says hey God your righteousness is of the Lord not your own that's why it's so important to get the Holy Ghost see me Lord heal me they were given roads listen he said because they've been blinded that they can't see their gospel that this people might be called out of the Gentiles for the bride they were given rose talking about the Jews the Bible said here under the trumpet them Jews who absolutely is against Christ and everything the reason they are because the Bible said they are blinded and they were blinded for your sake that's why we don't boss our self against the Jews hallelujah thank God that God was gracious enough to blind them that we can be grafted in I know it sounds terrible but when those words went out of their mouths at the day of crucifixion let his blood be on us and our children from then all the Jews have been having a rough time that curse deal is there that's why everybody hate them except the bride that's why but you know by God's grace what God is doing for us listen when God says fear not little flock it is the father's present that president give you the kingdom don't you fear your fear would keep God from operating with you no fear out I don't know whether I'm gonna make it if he promised it standing on the promises of God stand all the promises don't fear the devil or what he puts in your mind if you are truly God's elected he will bring it to pass [Music] promise children you are the promise show me in the world where God ever broke his promise it ain't that and who can be as bad as Jacob hallelujah but when it was time for Jacob to change God met him and God will meet you right there he will produce the right troubles for you to come forth he's gonna do it it might be suffering you might have to wrestle through it but deep but but you already in the scripture you will overcome the angel who is that the truth we don't love each other like we ought to so brother BAM said God gonna bring the squeeze it's the truth God can't get us to pray like we ought to this is the most slow for age ever hallelujah let us see a spirit ain't no joke it is a powerful force even that you gotta fight every day all the time hallelujah but God is on your side yeah hallelujah you just didn't become right you were always bribed like I tell people you can't become Ryder you must be bribed from the foundation like brother silver said before ty hallelujah oh he preached that message meet me in Jerusalem I like that as the truth he there that Roman Empire bound thereby what ecclesiastical power which wrong pagan Rome become papal Rome and was bound there in its tradition of Christianity what part of Christianity superstitions it had of Rome putting together all these things worshipping of women and all these other kinds of stuff Christmas days and holidays and Christmas and holidays in holy days and things it's been bout the tradition that it cannot let loose because as against Christian principles it's against Christian Christian principles still the same ungodly pagan race period and that spirit caught into the nation of the world according to the prophecy of Ezekiel and the rest of them and they were loosed upon the Jews who know nothing of the Spirit there is your mystery that he ate under the six under the seal there see notice we were we we went through it and showed you this trumpet there here last trumpet what take place and y'all know what happened right because of that they were killed by Stalin Hitler and Mussolini and now they were thus they were the servants of the Lord because we're not servants we bribed they were servants under the Lord crying how long how long why because Jews are an eye for an eye they still under the law hallelujah but the bride of Jesus Christ is like Stephen Lord hold not these things to their charge we have a different language it's almost over you know hallelujah that was from the free third trumpet listen he said he says listen it is to call them back to that atonement see the atonement they rejected and they rejected did so our eyes could be open and theirs were closed and during this time he seals open up and the trumpet blow and blowing of the trumpets just before the Messiah comes cuz they got to be in Palestine and you remember God had to harden Pharaoh's heart to run them out of Egypt now I wonder who what the name of God gonna be with Moses and Elijah show up two names that's not that's that's what people are doing hmm people think you're stupid cuz you you never be stupid as long as you got God in you you gotta love everybody know no matter what you got to forgive everybody that was a powerful message and forgiveness that brother Aaron McGarry preached you ought to get it once it come online and he preached that message and I tell you what it was just powerful even to me today he took the parable where Jesus said Amen there was a man who own own this is his master and he asked his master to forgive him his master forgave him he said but he had a Stuart or Matt someone under him and and the fella couldn't come up with it's a payment so instead of forgiving him he not only beat him and he put him in prison but the news got back to the master what this guy had done you know what God did know what the master did he took back his forgiveness he took his forgiving his back you don't want God to take away if you can now he said if he said listen the Bible says if you can't forgive others neither can I forgive you forgiveness is not a option not for the men who want to make heaven what no matter what that's why Stephen said Lord Holies things not to their charge he knew it not it must ringing is here too if you can't forgive you eat your brother's neetha but cannot forgive you that's why Jesus said Father forgive them for they know not what they do that's bride who Illyria is that okay now he says listen and the first time for thousands of years 2500 years and Israel is a nation with its own flag own arm in all it's considered listen the oldest Israel so smart I mean you wouldn't have this everyone for Israel you wouldn't have your your phone if it wasn't for Israel your computer wouldn't even work as accurately as it does if it wasn't for Israel that's where the brain is he wouldn't had atomic bomb if it went forward you God don't bless the people and people jealous of them that's all it is they tell us that these people could go into a land that was bearing full of rocks nobody could do not Widom not the British not the Palestine nobody could do nothing with that land put Israel in there and blossom like a rose they can't stand it it's just jealousy hallelujah hey they're not messing with nobody it tried to welcome everybody that really do ah but these people they just is just that jealousy and it's the scripture being fulfilled hallelujah you got Jacob and Esau over there hallelujah and that's just that's just the way it is so right Isaac and Ishmael however you want to say it but those two spirits are still raining today but think about it that this whole world is gonna eventually hate the Jew even America will turn her back as soon as we do the bomb would drop because just as soon as we curse Israel God will curse us he'll release you take that blood away here take that veil of blood off of us and by the grace of God America hadn't seen nothing yet right oh we've been we've been isolated God has been protected because there's still Christians here but once the salt is removed once we removed from this place judgment is gonna fall hallelujah and God gonna make sure that everything shake you got you got mount st. Helen and and what's the other one a Yellowstone and they said when mama cried a sister answer or something like that the Indians have a say I say so when big sister cry little sister answer so you and I know by Gods this is going to be something else let me move on let me see you know what people don't understand you know we've got all these theologians if they really want to truth all they had to do is come ask us right we'll give them a few brother Browns book Church ages book sales books and all and then they wouldn't need this old big Obama store out there they got all these books and and you know us Christmas things that they can write they can help us but you got to understand that most of the things that right is not Holy Spirit it's psychology you don't need Christian science to live right you need the Holy Ghost to live right all your righteousness is that full filthy rags without the Holy Ghost hallelujah come on somebody God interprets his own word and it doesn't really matter amen how we can take this word and break it down and put it this way and put it that way when it comes down to the end of it God is gonna do it the way he wants to do it right Oh a virgin shall conceive you know that man crazy we thought he was a prophet until he said that four hundred years or eight hundred years I can't recall which it was amen and you know the Bible went into darkness the Bible said there's a time it meant that men followed after their own thoughts and ideas and they were right in their own eyes hallelujah can you imagine a man being without a real preacher four hundred years hallelujah she were all both there three hundred and something years because we hadn't been there that long God sent a prophet and God said when when the property came he said it was darkness ghosts are right but there shall be like hallelujah and you must understand you're that light that God has established in this dark age that's your light so shine among men hallelujah almost done with this section I'll pick up on Sunday but my point is this when God came to Abraham and Sarah they laughed Sarah laughed how can this thing be let me tell you of something God can drown a man with a drop of water in reality he doesn't really need a water he can cause his own fluids to drowning but God can do what he wants to do if God says that he's gonna perfect me and bring me to a place of translation I ain't laughing I'm saying hey man I don't need to know the mathematics behind it I don't even care how he does it he says it I believe it and I'm standing on his promises that's what I tell people because people think let me tell you something let me say this by knowing all of the word does not make you bride Paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not charity it profiteth you nothing what about the people who are even and unlearned and brother Branham preached and Africa the Holy Ghost fell on them were they saying absolutely they were saying what about the eunuch the Bible never tells us what happened to him Philip baptized and he confess the Lord Jesus Christ Philip baptized him Andheri was gone he'll be there he didn't hear Paul's preaching as far as I know of Harley you are must understand let me read this code this is so good help me Lord I've got to go down to the bottom of this message new wine coming from the fourth seal brother brother L said listen now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate is to bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation well then there is a power of the revelation of the word it gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction satisfaction excuse me stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it vindicates it proves it calls in the scripture as we want to refer to it as a new why we always refer to it like that these are drunk or new wine what was new about what Peter preached cuz Peter preached that Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God it was already always in the scripture but he took the scripture this is that which was spoken by joelle in the last days that script was always there but Peter having the revelation that this was the time that this thing was being fulfilled made a new mine I've never heard that before it stimulated the people and after he after they heard they said well many brethren what must we do and when they said repent and be baptized an old bike God did they do it new wine hallelujah see this is what he says and as the natural wine reveals itself to stimulated power so does the new wine as it reveals the Word of God which is spirit see Oh please see the word itself is spirit I like that see because that is the new wine it is the spirit you believe that he said listen yeah then you you won't say well now somebody said that see let's see who said it and then we'll know whether it's true or not Saint John the sixth chapter the sixth chapter I believe it is 63rd verses it is the spirit that quickeneth but at that preacher was preaching the word it is the word spirit that's how people get the holy goes above said the word and they were filled with the Holy Ghost because the world that they were speaking was wise but he was spirit and that whole egos went from the mouth to the heart hallelujah that's the real way of receiving the Holy Ghost by way of the preaching and if you can allow yourself to believe that that word is God and that word is telling you you're perfect you innocent you high every comes across the pulpit you're justified is the word I'm in you take that word that word strikes you and it comes to life might make you cry and make might make you shout you know it y'all don't understand what the Holy Ghost is sometimes we think the Holy Ghost is in us and all of a sudden you're perfect no and sometimes we think the Holy Ghost get to get us to a place Amen that we can't make mistakes no God told brother branham he had the Holy Ghost did he not and I used this the other day he said if you don't move out of Jeffersonville and move out west you're gonna beat that man up God told him how he's gonna beat him up kick him down the hill and right the angel the law said if you don't do it this is what what is going to happen did brother Brandon had the Holy Ghost of course he did but what about that man who died a drunk at the preacher and but God brem said no the man saved god couldn't get in the bread repent so he put him to sleep like a a parent would spank a child and put them to sleep I didn't go lose none not one see the reason why you and I we understand this thing is election anything about her works it's good to be obedient but that's not what saved you oh I love that thought so you know what God never did tell King give him a revelation of it he just told him what to do he gave him instructions and that's what's happening with a lot of people in the message they getting the instructions but they don't have a revelation of what they're preaching the revelation that I'm preaching is not about William Bramley is about you Christ in you the hope of glory thank God for William Branham y'all understand me see people not being spiritual they think I'm down in the Prophet you're wrong sometimes they think I'm disrespecting him you're wrong he says the people don't understand they haven't lifted it they put him in a place that he don't even want to be Yoshi a book brother Brennan says forget about me what about that quote I had people coming to church instead where's the cloud where's the cloud like the cloud makes this a message Church what makes you a message churches when you get the Holy Ghost brother BAM called this message he said it is my Holy Ghost message oh we don't need no Creed's we don't need all the dog when we got enough stuff we fight where that was a quote I like the spirit the word is spirit and the Bible said the word is spirit it is the thing that quickens you that's why when we hear that where we know how to lose something just move and it's the truth that's my good I love that Atlas I love being in the in the atmosphere of the word more than I love being anywhere else you love the Lord I'm cutting this short now I'll finish it on Sunday Lord's will but now is the time what day are you living in that Sloan says this day will not take us like a thief in the night you cannot be that blind to see that the Lord is not soon to come and we're right at the edge of a translation brother Brennan said garden go send that out pouring on us because we've been so good is that that's what he said that's a quote it's not because you've been so good because it's this grace because of his mercy because he favors you didn't about how good you've been how good Jacob been he was a shyster for God met him hallelujah and you and I must understand anything gonna be because you've been so good because he made you a promise hallelujah Hey look at Abraham come on somebody Abraham messed up all around but God still many it was a promise god I'm gonna let this world corrupt you hallelujah that worked he said nay I will not leave my body in Hell neither will he this body see corruption right what body not your type you where are you now but this body in itself is inhale because it's flesh and flesh and blood cannot enter but this thing that's why it takes on the influence of this world hello is that right brother - a hail and earth is blending it's a blending and we are now feeling with this thing all this kind of demonic power and forces that are against heaven you and I couldn't even make it out here if it wasn't for the grace of God how'd you go fight Lucifer you Oh David he whipped Goliath because God was in him you whipping the devil now only because God how many of us know the word and sometimes the enemy catches herself garden but if God hasn't build a fire around you people I want you to understand this message is the greatest thing it is set us free if we could only see how free we are that's why nobody came yeah no I don't been on dominating spirits before I came to the Apostolic that's worse than the Pentecostals and you don't even you know they the sweetest people you ever seen until you cross oh hey brother I understand you rub that kid in the wrong way you got something on your hand I mean it was legal yes sir and it put it in you so much that you actually thought that's really what you wanted to yeah I understand me so I know what dominate I could write off nobody controls you not me I don't try to control you nobody controls you your head is Christ I'll tell you by God's grace what the word says but when it comes to somebody controlling you and trying to make you do something I'm not one of them that's why you saw well you're not a sister dear wearing them how your shoes no I can't make her stop if God don't tell her to do it I'm gonna make all hypocrite people need Holy Ghost if they not that they don't have sometimes people just got justification but you need to come all the way up don't get me wrong folks they'll tree-huggers they the chain is no strong no stronger than its weakest link right I mean it doesn't mean that you're not climbing up here you doesn't mean you don't have faith it doesn't mean you have verse your knowledge it doesn't mean you don't have temper but sometimes we patients get us sometimes we're stuck with godliness but it doesn't mean you don't have the others see it's that Wheatley that's holding you back that you've got to overcome it's a victory and when you find yourself being tipped in a certain area you got the call like this song say you got the call on the chain breaker he breaks the chain don't let the devil steal from you like you ain't got nothing it appears that way when you fall but that's not true you got more God going with you than the other cuz you let me tell you something if God has elected you to be bribed ain't nothin gonna stop it anyhow blessed an I love this promise you I love this promise I love it the way mayor says Lord you know I never knew a man how can this thing be I don't understand it all the be done to me according to your word that's all I'm saying and whatever God does let him do it you're gonna suffer you're gonna go through it why do we feel like we're gonna make heaven on such a flower bed of ease when God is going through Calvary and everything else suffer through all of our things that we do I mean can you imagine a God that loves so much don't know nothing but love and yet instead we disappoint him every day he loved us anyhow that's why the Word of God said we're supposed to love each other like God loves us you don't want to be disappointed but I'm so sorry that's part of your growing up hallelujah if you have children they're gonna disappoint you ain't gonna do everything you want them to do I didn't do everything my mama wanted me to do and it beats goes on until God break on a change you just wait for the change don't give up on the change just wait for word I'm gonna wait like joe said to my change come ain't gonna wear I'll tell us about the other day and I'm closing I said you know what I said I feel like I'm in a perfect storm he said at least you're in the middle where the piece is I said well I'm not sure I'm in the middle then but the point is I never come from every area and then a brother called me today and I'm like oh his troubles are worse than mine so hey I'm not so bad after all see there's always somebody's that storms are worse than yours Oh Lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace we think of it your mercy we thank you for your goodness you've been so good to me you've been better to me that I've been to myself Lord Jesus I do love you lord I just want to be perfect in that sight my ambition Lord is to be perfect but Lord you said even through your prophet you don't want us to be wishy washy but I realized oh god that your Bible says sellout continuously and that don't mean if I'm I got I got to continue to sin until you change me he said shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid and father I pray that you be merciful to us give us grace to see and to understand and to love you in spite of all the things we go through this is a hard way we chose the harder way I'd rather the harder way because at least I know Lord it is the right way so many fish Oh God can swim downstream but only a special kind of fish can go upstream against the current help us Lord there will be that rainbow trout that you've made us to be thank you Jesus for this word Lord you know I have no art no bitterness in my heart against anyone and I thank you for that pray for God if anyone hear this word to know that there is no bitterness in my heart but I will always stand for truth help us now keep us and guide us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we turn fear amen you eat of [Music]
