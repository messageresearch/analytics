[38:31] my wife is not here tonight my family
[38:35] she's preparing to for a yard sale a
[38:41] garage sale a superpower University
[38:43] garage somewhere in the transition
[38:46] she pulled a muscle in her back in her
[38:50] back and left as if
[38:53] so she is at home recovering
[38:57] so that she would be able to finish her
[38:59] work this weekend
[39:01] so we can as we stand
[39:04] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[39:07] to Revelations the first chapter
[39:10] apocalypse
[39:11] we're going to read the 18th verse
[39:23] and it reads Ali I am he that liveth
[39:28] and was dead
[39:32] and behold I Am Alive forevermore may
[39:35] verse usually this year and I have the
[39:38] keys of hell and death
[39:44] let us pray father God we come before
[39:48] you Lord we thank you for your grace
[39:51] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[39:55] for being so good to us
[39:57] father I just pray tonight
[40:00] that you're perfect will be done
[40:03] and we will give you all the praise
[40:07] in all the glory in Jesus Christ's name
[40:11] we pray
[40:12] amen amen you may be seated
[40:15] I'll try to move as quickly through the
[40:19] message as I possibly can
[40:22] I really have a lot to say and that's
[40:27] usually that's usually the the story
[40:30] but uh being that it is Wednesday night
[40:33] it is now eight o'clock so eleven
[40:36] basically and I'll try to get you out in
[40:38] just a little bit
[40:40] but my sir my message tonight
[40:44] my massage as well it deals with Harvest
[40:49] at the end of harvest
[40:52] and I'm not sure if we all know where we
[40:56] put we are positioned today
[41:00] but we are at the end of harvest
[41:06] this is not the planting time
[41:09] this is the reaping time
[41:14] and we must understand
[41:18] exactly where we are in history
[41:22] when it comes to our profit he tells us
[41:26] that before one bomb drops
[41:29] the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone
[41:35] I'm not sure
[41:37] if everybody is aware here tonight
[41:42] we have already entered into World War
[41:46] Three
[41:48] say it again I don't know whether you
[41:52] are aware
[41:53] that we have already entered into World
[41:57] War Three
[42:00] he told us to watch Russia
[42:03] and they're now playing games
[42:06] Russia the United States
[42:09] Ukraine and all of them and you must
[42:11] understand
[42:14] Parts out slowly
[42:17] but I believe that God is giving us
[42:20] Grace to understand where we are where
[42:23] we are
[42:25] so we can make ourselves ready
[42:28] see there's really no hiding place no
[42:32] matter where you go there is no hiding
[42:34] place other than in Christ Jesus
[42:38] and this place is a secret place
[42:42] Hallelujah and it's given to the Bride
[42:46] of Jesus Christ
[42:48] where to hide
[42:50] Hallelujah even David said

[43:13] who don't know the name of God Amen
[43:19] they don't understand
[43:21] what the Book of Revelation is all about
[43:26] so many people even theologians say we
[43:31] don't need Revelations
[43:33] but without Revelation and talk about
[43:37] the Book of Revelation because the Book
[43:39] of Revelation amen describe Jesus Christ
[43:44] who he is he said he was the I am
[43:49] yesterday today and forever
[43:52] he is the god that changes
[43:57] and you and I must realize tonight
[44:00] this is at the end of harvest
[44:03] this is the time the bride is making
[44:06] herself ready is that right

[44:46] character of Christ
[44:49] Hallelujah it is not about the devil is
[44:53] about you and Jesus Christ
[44:55] Hallelujah but God is forming and he's
[45:00] making you in his creation right now to
[45:05] be true Sons and Daughters of God but
[45:09] the only way he can get us that Melissa
[45:11] to come to that place
[45:13] we must die and write to ourselves
[45:17] and many of us now realize
[45:22] we're not as dead as we thought we were
[45:27] Hallelujah but God is a perfectionist
[45:31] he's going to keep working on you
[45:34] continue until he completes the
[45:37] Masterpiece
[45:40] he said well brother Brooks how do I
[45:42] know I'm one of them
[45:44] in the message

[1:38:04] went through the Catholic Church
[1:38:07] you could find it I forgot her last name
[1:38:09] but I was reading that today
[1:38:11] about how they they taught her in such a
[1:38:14] Catholic way
[1:38:20] to save your family because she was
[1:38:24] taught
[1:38:26] if she wanted to be a nun yes
[1:38:34] me
[1:38:36] and she spent so many years there yeah
[1:38:38] she
[1:38:41] told us that when all you know
[1:38:43] I don't know how she died but I know
[1:38:45] they haunted her
[1:38:48] because she was telling too much
[1:38:54] she said when she was giving her
[1:38:56] testimony I have nothing against
[1:38:58] Catholic people it is
[1:39:04] what about Jesus Christ
[1:39:13] I went to another site
[1:39:22] all of the things that were going on in
[1:39:24] the church
[1:39:26] but the thing that caught me
[1:39:29] he was saying but we're the real bride
[1:39:32] of Christ
[1:39:34] there you go so when the real bride of
[1:39:38] Christ comes to persecute
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:16] when you
[1:40:19] when a person is so tied up into that
[1:40:22] for example
[1:40:29] to win a Muslim to Christ
[1:40:33] the same principle
[1:40:36] how difficult it is for you to win a
[1:40:40] Baptist
[1:40:44] Methodist
[1:40:46] it's the same thing because that's where
[1:40:50] they grew up
[1:40:53] if there's no predestinated seed in
[1:40:56] there yes
[1:41:02] but don't get mad with them anyhow
[1:41:08] amen
[1:41:10] hallelujah you love the Lord I'm almost
[1:41:13] done
[1:41:15] you know we look at this thing and I'm
[1:41:17] gonna go ahead and close it but
[1:41:19] see the nation and the world rejected
[1:41:22] the gift of God I'm closing
[1:41:27] when they rejected the gifts
[1:41:30] they rejected God
[1:41:32] is that right that's the way God said I
[1:41:35] send you Elijah
[1:41:38] the prophet before that great and
[1:41:40] Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:41:43] and when they put brother Brandon out
[1:41:47] on the earth they thought they were
[1:41:49] excommunicating a man
[1:41:52] he didn't know that that was written in
[1:41:55] Revelations the third time
[1:42:01] any man would open unto me
[1:42:08] three they didn't realize
[1:42:11] but that's the way God always does it
[1:42:14] hides himself in simplicity
[1:42:20] that was the way with John the Baptists
[1:42:27] but he was there was as a prophecy said
[1:42:29] and the scripture said there was no
[1:42:31] greater Prophet yeah
[1:42:48] basically typed out
[1:42:52] here
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:59] showing that
[1:43:02] is
[1:43:14] so it doesn't come to a surprise
[1:43:18] a friend of mine a pastor and um
[1:43:23] told me yesterday
