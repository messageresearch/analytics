TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] amen Shekinah onion D is all I long for a pen we think I voice grace and His mercy we're just gonna get right into the Word of God and ask you as we stand turn to James please the first chapter thank you brother James we'll go to 1st Peter first chapter James 1:17 through 18 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning of his own will be God he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of a first fruit of his creatures amen first Peter first chapter beginning at the 20th verse who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but it was manifested in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren seeing that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being a born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord and do it forever and this is the word which the gospel is preached unto you let us pray I dear Heavenly Father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray Lord God this evening that you would minister to our hearts forgive us of all our sins and our shortcomings we pray father God that your word be exalted above all things and we pray right now Lord God that you bless this assembly in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to just talk tonight on just a simple word called faith a lot of times we look at faith in so many ways sometimes faith is confused with hope and as we say sometimes when hope is present or being used as something that we put on our victory in a distance as opposing to I hope we're not certain of it's not a certainty but when it comes to faith faith is a certainty because the Bible said now faith is faith is not just a thing it is a substance it is something that is unseen to the naked eye but visible by by the effects of it when we talk about faith we talk about something that has been given by God because all men don't have faith faith in itself is a gift come from God when we think about faith faith is the that ability to take the unseen and make it visible all that we see here today our lights our chairs our automobiles everything that we we now can touch and see has a products of somebody's faith faith in itself has been given by God when we talk about all the achievements of man and how far we have come in the scientific world we understand that this world this scientific world could only be achieved by somebody's faith God gives him him for inspiration inspiration began to move in a vision and the vision in itself become materialized often time when we deal with this kind of a thing we know that everybody don't get the vision like we get it I mean you take for an example when it came to Noah Noah had a vision he had an inspiration he heard from the unseen and but but because he believed but because and because he knew that it it was it was God a man he moved in fear and the Bible said he prepared an ark and because of his vision eight souls were saved but as you can see that many people in his day didn't believe because you and I don't even know the racial of people that really died in that flood understanding when the flood took place the world in itself was one land you know it was after the flood the land began was divided so we don't have we have no idea how massive the land was but how big a however big it was somebody had a vision and we call that faith it is something that God gave he didn't deserve it the Bible doesn't say that he was such a great man that that God but God did a work we realize it was God's favor God I did a thing and it was called favor he it's because it was all about his will I'm taking my time but you know I realized by God's grace that it is something that you and I must understand our whole salvation rest upon our faith uh you say I'm elected how do you know you elected you say I'm chosen how do you know that your chosen faith has been revealed to you it is something that God gave you and has given you nobody can take it from you even if no one else can see it you can see it and this is what faith is faith is that thing that you see before you see it you see it before you see it Amen like Abraham he called those things that be not as though they were because he was able to see it before it materialized before it manifested itself as I said it is a gift faith is a good gift and the Bible said every good and perfect gift come from above so it's given to us by God even if you don't have faith in yourself it will it would determine what kind of a person you would be in this life you must have faith in yourself and when I say that I'm working with a Christian because we understand that the faith that we have in ourselves is the faith in God we can achieve all things is that right Paul said that we're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus now you have to have faith for that to operate in you even though it's in the scripture that God doesn't quicken that to you if he doesn't inspire you by that word amen you can never have faith in it but once that faith comes and once you in you realize that that scripture is a given vision to you by God you can conquer any and everything is that Alright first Peter who says who verily was ordained before the Foundation's world but was manifested in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in who God amen so you must realize amen that it is because of God you have faith and God has given you faith to have faith in God there is there's no other way you can can achieve this goal with that without God that's why the Bible said that when God when the word is preached all cannot believe because all do not have faith there are men who are deign to never have faith because of who they are and what they are they can't have a rep they can't have a revelation of God no more than Cain could have a revelation of God right Cain in his mental capacity understood he was God but listen once you have a true revelation of God you fear God it is only those who don't have a true revelation of God they are the only ones that don't fear God they're the ones that can accuse God there ones who said God doesn't exist they're the ones that yes sir oh i'm just angry with god see you don't have a real revelation of god when you do such things as that i've seen one by the name of Jonah and I often have wonder how Jonah could get such an attitude with God but he did and but you know it doesn't mean that you're not of God because you have an attitude but you haven't come to that revelation of who he really is you understand me so God even took Jonah Jonah went to preach for God at Nineveh but Jonah had a lot of things he need to come to know and understand himself and through this trial he became he understood who God was and at the end of the day Jonah name was put in the a feint a book a hall Hall of Fame a minute I'm sorry folks I'm just a little tired but I'll be all right God is here with me amen you understand the Bible goes on and says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit of unfailing love of the Brethren seeing that you love one another with a pure heart fervently don't you know that's faith in action you can't even love somebody without faith faith and love are twins they go together you can't even believe in God without love hello that's what makes your faith in believing that he is God gods ha ha ha the scripture go we love Him because He first amen is that right so it all works together amen so that we can understand it now how many of us believe that we were born again if you believe that you're born again that means what the seed in which you were born is incorruptible I want you to think about that the seed in which you were born in is incorruptible it can't grow oh it can't be defiled it can't cannot come up short it's going to produce the potential of the seed it will manifest itself in your day y'all understand me so what are you saying the incorruptible seed is Jesus Christ Christ in you the hope of glory so when we think about that you've got to believe it I am perfect oh my god yes you are perfect if the seed of God is in you and it has been quickened you are perfect no death or hell can stop you from reaching your goal hallelujah is that right often time we think the ability to to uh that's it like that we think them but the ability to produce Christ is in our efforts in her own doings and that's where God had the Jews in law because he put that log there and he told him you must do everything every one of these words must be fulfilled in your life in order for you to be perfect they never reach the goal they all stumbled they all fail they all came short of the glory of God it is only now where the seat of God is quicken that you and I can come to the perfection in which God has ordained for us to come to and that itself is by faith it is a revelation that I have been created to be made perfect perfectly in the image and likeness of God it is a revelation is that right you see because it no science can explain faith faith cannot be explained by science I don't care now they tried to categorize it and break it down and faith is a dimensional term it is something that is from another dimension and you say well what do you mean because before the world was formed the Bible says by faith so faith existed before the worlds were formed it was by faith the world was formed you understand me so by faith it's not like God got an instrument called faith God if there be a instrument it is God God Himself is what we call faith it is the only thing that there's no such thing as a perfect faith without it being God's faith the just shall live by his faith not yours that is why we need the quickening we need the Holy Ghost we need God amen living in us to produce his word otherwise it won't be produced even though Mary Mary amen was a virgin she wasn't the only virgin but she was the chosen version she was the one that was elected and I really believe that when God came to Mary she said well how can this thing be that was that human reasoning that was that way we we think how can I be dry or how can I make a translation or how can I ever be perfect it ain't up to you know it ain't up is nothing not up to you no more like Michael Mary it wasn't up to Mary Mary was already chosen God knew already he knew he already knew her response hallelujah and after she questioned he didn't say don't you worry about me about this Mary the Holy Ghost will overshadow you how was she able to perform the act is because the Holy Ghost over shadow how are you going to reach perfection the Holy Ghost over shattering a man he does that you are a creation a new creation just like Jesus Christ Himself was a creation and so are you and the only way will ever come to a full potential is by the holy ghost even though the body was made of Jesus even though he was a son he did things at the age of 12 but it was unto the age of 30 where the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him is that right why because he could not take on the devil just as he was he needed power he needed taught y'all hear me the word that was once letter had to be quickened to life hallelujah we think faith faith is like a trust in God and people they say Christianity is is made of that kind of faith you know in in in which we trust in God and in his promises and things like that but it goes beyond that because faith was introduced before there was any scripture written God came to Adam and Adam told him listen this is all you got out here right you can eat you can eat of all the trees but you not eat of the tree of good and not is a good evil at that point in time he had faith he never lost faith hello Adam wasn't deceived you understand me he didn't he'd never disbelieved the god word of God he walked out knowing he was breaking the word it wasn't his unbelief hello he knew he was deceived she broke it but when Adam walked out he knew he was breaking the word but he also understood the only way that he could save II was to do this he knew God meant what he said and said what he meant and he knew that God said the day you eat of this tree you should surely die so you got to understand that he willfully placed himself under the the authority of death he died for his wife by faith now I don't know what went on into our on the mind and heart of Adam but somehow Adam must have known God was gonna work it out cuz God had already given him the authority the word be fruitful and multiply so if he was to die he could not cook the commission would be done not lost so somewhere had a knew he did maybe didn't understand I don't know but he knew like they say that word is that word is not maybe but perhaps God you know how is it you know maybe there is a chance you know that thing is maybe there is a chance you know and that's how we work with God sometimes because we know him so well we think this word is maybe there is a possibility and with that thought in your mind that there is a possibility that I that God can keep this thing moving even though I've done wrong God keeps it moving and sure enough God did now we look at the scripture and we think about it what the Bible tells us now we're not under law the only law we are under is the law of life and that's God and that law in itself produces life in itself it is life it is God living in human vessels but God being that it was separated he calls law showing that there was no way that you and I could ever achieve the gold that he intended us for us to achieve but because of his death he binded up the breach he brought he did you know that even Jesus Christ himself had to have faith in his own word it was a revelation it was y'all hear me it was a revelation because let me say it like this perhaps there was a time and we heard this before that that when the devil tempted Jesus he he didn't fully understand or fully understand you know it was the devil but the thing that caught his attention was that was when the devil says I'll give you all of this if you bow that's when he called him Satan get behind me see when you trot when you're going through try us sometime negative things come to your mind and you're questioning it you know you're not certain as it is of God but one thing I know about the devil he always wants you to bow he wants you to bow to his authority and whenever Satan comes with that then you know that's the devil and that's when Jesus says no no no no Satan this is the deal you only worship the Lord your God and him only right so we realize Amen that when we come about faith how we must understand that's why we can't run after all of these things that that that are images that are set up above the word I don't care if his message people doing it Israel did things but because they did it it didn't make it right they bowed to bail and bouton boat Moloch and all these other items but those idols but those Christians who had a faith who had a revelation that there was only one God that God was Jehovah or that God was Elohim even they understood all these other little idols meant nothing they couldn't speak they couldn't hear they couldn't help they were dumb idols made up and created by man right but their faith even though they couldn't see God they saw God hallelujah and you and I ought to be able had to have a faith in God that can see God every day Oh therefore faith you can understand that that's why it's so important the Bible said Abraham was justified by justified by faith is that right he believed God he was in a land of idols but we need heard the voice of God it became a revelation that the god of heaven is the god of the God that can talk even though he had never seen him as of yet he understood that this God has to be God because he's the only one that's ever talked to me hallelujah and Abraham was not even circumcised yet hello so let me tell you some people say well you know God though here sinner's prayer I understand what that means but when it comes to a real seed of God God will hear your prayer Abraham wasn't circumcised let me say that again Abraham was not even circumcised and God talked to me hello people what God talk to me and I I know I know I'm saying what God talked to the serpent God talked to Judas did he not but that didn't make him seed it was the faith that Abraham had him in the garden spoke to him the Bible said abraham believed God and because he believed him it was counted to him as righteousness I believe I'm ordained to make a rapture I believe this because of the word who has sanctified me has cleared me and my certification is not of me it's of him my righteousness is not on me it's of him can you see it brother books sometimes but I know one thing that my life is here in here so as long as I'm looking at his life I'm perfect hallelujah is that right one thing about faith faith never gives up brother and says is like a man with muscles hair on his chest he never gives up not even death can strip you of faith the Bible tells us in Hebrew 11 that all the Saints that died they died in faith they had a promise even though the promise had not been fulfilled in their day it never made them doubt they even went to the grave believing God was going to do it and because they believed God when Jesus rose up from the grave their faith poured Jesus to them or they understand me he could not leave them in the grave because they believed that one day he was coming back for them so faint it's a powerful tool it's something that God gave you feyza i need more faith faith comes by hearing hearing the Word of God is that right how you gonna have more faith if you don't read how you gonna have more faith if the Word of God is not preached to you people don't come to church like they shoes how are you gonna have faith because it is bad at the preaching of the word when the world is quickened to your heart I don't know how God works it all I know is with as many of us here he's feeding every one of us at the same time hallelujah with the same bread but leading different needs only God can do that the faith is the kind that could believe against hope you know when hope is there is no hope no hope Abraham God waited to Abraham was dead because before Abraham didn't half he didn't have to struggle he was able to produce her Ishmael right but when the ability of him producing anything was taken away from him and God said you gonna have a son that's when Abraham left he I'll know that Abraham left just like Sarah did Sarah was already dead but Abraham wasn't so it's easier to have faith when you still got a little substance you understand me but when God takes that from you when it looks like all hope is gone when it looks like a Lazarus situation that's when faith comes in he comes he comes in like the hero say what you want to say I know my redeemer live y'all understand me and so God brings us into a place where when everybody's saying is impossible to happen you says but God said it will Abraham you've gone 20 years 25 years and you haven't had a baby I don't care I still have faith Wow because God said so see it goes off the word if he's off the word it is the word and then that gives faith strength hmm when faith gives the word strength so but so the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God but he left hello he left the Bible said you know there was nothing found wrong Abraham didn't do no wrong but he did but she after going underneath the blood of Jesus Christ all those things he did back then in the Old Testament was thrown out somewhere in the sea of forgetfulness so when they were getting to write about Abraham according to the Holy Spirit Abraham was a perfect example hello you saw a brother I don't know about that it's the same with you look how many mistakes you've made and though you believe God you still stumble there's still things amen that distract you just like a distracted Abraham hallelujah but at the end of the day it's like any bitchu area when they began to read about you they read about all the good things they don't never mention how bad we were everybody when they die in the obituaries they write like they were angels Wow because it's a thing you always want to know and see the good in people right so is it with God when it comes to the end of the road you and I have been a perfect bride hallelujah why because all of the evidence of your sin has been washed in the blood Wow because you believe God you have faith enough that God could take away all the blemishes all the stains all the wicked and wrong things you've done in your life Wow saved God is able to make you is that right he said ah he was able to present us faultless go over to God why because he's not looking at your life it's not a law it's grace hallelujah the bow said Abraham Ben stagger but look how many times God told him to go right and he went left right it meant because he said God said he didn't stagger and then God sent you Abraham's seed God will say the same thing about us as he did Abraham we never staggered at the promises of God why we made mistakes but we were dead right winded hallelujah we didn't leave and we stay within hallelujah and like brother said even if you backslide he said if you if you got a seed of God in you if you've been quickened he said you'll be miserable out there he said you will come back to God and if you don't come back to God God will put you to sleep hello because he's now he won't leave he won't miss one understand Amen that when we talk about God we're talking about things that are dimensional and oftentimes we forget we're dimensional creatures hallelujah you say how can I be a dimensional creature the Bible said we're now living in heavenly places in Christ Jesus y'all look like y'all here at higher ground but the real you is in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah you are dimensional halle-loo is that right the probably God proved that we were dimensional because he was able to call people up or people came up and he could go in that dimension one two three he said that the age of four this happened to you a dog scared you and this is why you became nervous he showed that these dimensions what we call dimensions is another world that right that's what the browser guy said he said whatever you doing here is what you're doing there so there's another world we have nothing we don't know nothing about but he says we're there he said well I don't know about that well I can tell you among that number of people that ran to him and said my precious brother I was one of them I don't even remember it and perhaps I was a little tot when that took place but when he saw me I had already been washed in the blood of the Lamb filled with the Holy Ghost and then in heavenly places before I even came to salvation o y'all come on come on come on he's nothing but the truth let me go back up here as I said hey it's a powerful thing and there's only one faith one Lord one faith one baptism that's your word one God the Father of all who is above all through all and in you all so there's no way of getting or getting out of it David said if I made my bed in the lowest part of hell he's there if I took wings and I fly I flew off in the morning he's there there's no way of getting away from God he's all and in all is that the Word of God now the Bible tells us when y'all got to understand this everybody have eyes but they cannot see there are spiritual eyes that spirit dimensions that we can see that they cannot see being in a Christian Ram makes us see things that the people who are in darkness can't see the Bible like it is that they are there sitting in darkness while we are in light hallelujah and so therefore we can see things they can't see and don't expect them to see what you see until they come to the light it is a dimensional thing amen and you you say well what do you mean brother but let me tell you something I came from God in order for me to sin I must have had to descend I descended you descended and all if you descended from heaven if you came down from heaven you'll go back to heaven that was what although that was of what the blood of Christ was all about when you realize it that's why he gave Abraham unconditional faith because Abraham was a chosen one election of God there was no way Abraham could be lost it wasn't even in God's plan for him to be lost y'all understand me even though he came into a lost world Abraham came saved he said what do you mean because in the mind of God he was and God didn't have my I'm just wondering now even though he was I didn't already put his name on the book he's one of mine he's the father of nation and all these things now but if I send him through this thing here it wonder what is he gonna be saying know it already been finished you know it's like an author when you write a book he comes to the end nothing can be changed in that book what's on page 7 is on page 7 and though you haven't gotten to page 7 yet is that page 7 won't change because it's been written and the authors come to the end of the book now I know in the world they revamp theirs and it changed this Amen add a little more color whatever they call it to it admit but God doesn't do that because his word is perfect and those this is what I love about the salvation I don't have to hope I'm saved because either I am or I am NOT but if God has given me the ability to believe that I am that I am it is God who works this thing it is by grace and faith is that right now we look at this thing we see how they in the book of Matthew 17 the Mount Transfiguration a scene a reality struck those disciples now maybe we never thought about it but they had never seen anybody who was dead for hundreds of years living they no doubt muster up their eyes and everything else amen here this bright light shine and they see Jesus clothing this light and they see Moses and Elijah standing there what was it they were looking through another dimension you saw why would you say that just like when Saul was on his way to Damascus amen and the light of God shining down and struck everybody didn't see the light everybody didn't hear the voice my Paul was ushered into another dimension he heard the voice he heard the words of the boss he saw the light and he had a conversation with Jesus and nobody else understood another dimension standing right there face to face rod that was faith and so was it his word with Moses and Elijah amen that's why it was so real to him here was these division of these two men and like I said how did they know it was Moses Elijah something in them registered that they knew that that was Moses and Elijah hallelujah it's the same way when the dead in Christ raised there will be something in us that will make us know these people hmm is that when we get to heaven you know we always I did I always thought when I got to heaven I'm gonna spend all this time coming to know who these people are I know these people are ready I knew them before the foundation of the world we want fellowship when when when the church service was one service we one fellowship that's why we feel such a kindred spirit because we were there in the beginning that's faith that's what it is it's a revelation amen call those things that be now it's a revelation that your existence did not even start here it's a revelation that joy existence is eternal you had no beginning you had no end therefore I can scream out like Paul I cannot die hallelujah and that's what this dimension it was amazing because Peter and John they said should we build three Tabernacles hallelujah so I'm gonna go back to you so you can understand that at the end of the day in the book of Revelation they said there was no tabernacle say why because the land was the tabernacle you understand me so I can't build another tabernacle or some other - because there was always one we were always in him and at the end of this whole thing we will be in him he is the tabernacle am i making sense every Lincoln said that's why all of this idolatry these things that that whip that people are putting in a place of salvation it will never work it cannot save you it didn't make you it didn't create you thank God I'm not in the image of them all you understand me God made us in His image you understand me you sure we're brothers how can it be I know a friend right now whose wife Indian brother from South Africa Newcastle his wife mother was a one of those Indians in India that worship monkeys and and she one day kind of peeked into her mother's womb Wat mother's room while she was praying and while her mom was praying her face disfigured into a monkey's face hello you understand me so this demon that was in the image of a monkey transformed her face and I always think about that because I think if that demon was to transform her face into a monkey then that was the same that how God was able to transform Stephens face hallelujah they said he had the face of an angel hallelujah the light of God over shattered him and the very image that was in him reflecting itself out that's exactly what the devil does where everybody whatever demon is there it reflects itself whether ever say there's a man in adoption - he said now God did the same thing to his son when he took Jesus up on Mount Transfiguration he took Peter James and John up there that three witnesses the earth there was Jesus Moses and Elijah and God upon the mountain they they there they stood up there on the mountain and the first thing you know they looked and Jesus was glorified before them you understand me he took three witnesses a man from Earth and three witnesses from heaven to dimensions but they still as witnesses earth and heaven was witnessing the crowning of the glorifying of Christ Jana Stanley and brother Branham said like this when a man is fully adopted he said that's the same kind of adoption we get he said well when is that when your body has changed cuz that's what happened to him his body changed he was glorified oh come on people that ought to make you shout see you're fully full adoption doesn't come until your body has changed to wit adoption science y'all y'all y'all y'all tired - that's what it feels like up here like everybody's tired so let me put some action in this thing there they stood up there on the mountain and the first thing you know they looked and Jesus was glorified before them is that right how many know that the scripture says that he dressed him in a robe of immortality hey and he said his raiment sign like the Sun is that right and a cloud over shout at them not just him him and Peter and John and them fell on their face and they looked and there stood Moses and Elijah talking to him and Moses had been dead and buried in an unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah took a chariot ride to heaven 500 years before that whoa he said but they were still there hallelujah though this earthly tower now can be dissolved I have one waiting I have a building you have a building Christ in you and yet you're in Christ figure it out hallelujah there they talked to him see he had taken Jesus up to see them to see what he was all about to see their show him these things and they talked with him he had a conversation with them and then as soon as Peter looked back again and and the glorification was off of Jesus they seen Jesus only and a voice came from clouds and said this is my beloved son hear you him his name just as good as mine now hear ye him that's it adopted and place sons hallelujah and y'all think just the Holy Ghost is here that ain't it that ain't all of it there's a lot of people with the Holy Ghost some will even miss the rapture because amen the Holy Ghost is not in their soul but those Amen who's Holy Ghost is in their soul and they allow the Holy Spirit to bring them up into a statue you understand me and when God come and this is what I really see when God began to sweep one more time people saw where the revival is over maybe sold for a lot of people but there's another coming that God will work a work in a bride of Jesus Christ amen that would give her a rapturing faith it's true some of us only have fake to kill a headache but God will anoint us a man in such a power will be the true sons and daughters of God don't worry he will come he will be on time and he will perform everything in you that he promised now faith is I am a son of God now that's what the Bible said now are you sons of God and it does not yet appear what you shall be but when he shall come or when he shall appear we know one thing we'll be like him what happened when he appeared those thunders were loosed hallelujah and God gave us his divine nature and when he quickened us when he quickened that seed that divine nature cannot be stopped because it's a perfect seed he says it's it's kind of seed that can grow in any kind of weather by its dimensional over there your understanding so you and I must understand by God's grace God is doing the thing in us what we need to do is just have faith in God don't ever let the devil make you doubt you won't make a rapture you believe it you confess it let it be your testimony it ain't about what you did I did this stuff it's about what he does and if you have a of something in your heart that makes you believe you bribed you must confess it because you got to give it to the angel the angel has to make you come to pass the age of confession that right there is that's what brother Owen said if you confess it there's an angel that makes it come to pass you gotta confess it he said we each one count come down to the end of the road where we're going to give it a count for every word that's why we got to preach faith you got to call those things that be not as though they were about yourself about your loved ones I mean don't let doubt get in your spirit call it don't hope hope will help you none but hope only makes you miserable yeah you know what I hope they get here on time I hope they get here home time you can understand me hope makes you miserable but faith hallelujah makes you stand like the Rock of Gibraltar hallelujah now when we are born our first little cry goes on all on tape it's it's going to be played back again at the day of judgment even the clothes you wear would be showed in your face at that day of judgment even science has found that by television see see television doesn't manufacture picture it only channels it the color of clothes every time you move every thought in your mind it is absolutely kept on God's record and that big thing will be laid laid right before you every one of them filthy dresses you wore every time you went to the barbershop cut hair that God God give you is going to be your answer for it you can't make a move right there just even the thoughts of your heart while you're doing it will be played right before you is that right y'all know that's true I mean Lucifer couldn't even get away with it I have said in your heart right so what what are you saying that's why he gotta be under the blood people the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can race this away you must remain under the blood y'all believe the faith a faith in his blood is the thing that works absolutely you can make moves right there and just even the thoughts of your heart while you're doing it will be played right before you how you going to escape how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation see we're not going to escape every move in the thoughts of your heart is recorded right in another dimension here in the color of your clothes you wear television color television proves it right out pulls it out and shows the seat and that's just in one dimension from the three that we live in what he said we live in three you know Paul says like this he said we're not the children of Wrath he said beloved we are persuaded better things of you and the things that accompany salvation though we speak for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister and we desire every one of you to show the same diligence to their full assurance of the hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but follows a bit through faith and patience inherit the promises hmm well I give up I quit because you know I just don't see myself getting better how you gonna see yourself getting better it's God in you you clothed with sinful flesh it's the inner man that God is looking at your flesh is condemned rarity is already judged hello it is that that day amen yo what your flesh will be redeemed but right now it is a wicked old enemy of yours hmm but we must know understand listen assess for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself God made a promise God made a promise to you brother branham said it like this God knew that in this day you would have a desire to be saying and he saved you but mind you he gave you desire to be saved thank God for the desire saying surely I will bless thee and multiply I will multiply thee and so forth after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise did he not the Bible said Abraham looked for a city whose maker was God and brother Branham said when he got there to Palestine or right there when Jerusalem all he needed to do was look up Jerusalem will stick right vet Yahoo Jerusalem was right above him hallelujah huh and that's what you and I understand heaven is not a million miles away heaven isn't in another dimension right here so what do you say I'm trying to tell you something you can't see God but God is here first of all he said were two or three of God that I'm in the mist that means he's in the middle of us he's right there hallelujah but even so God is still here he's just in another dimension the all-seeing what I he is the one that sees everything right two immutable things I love it I'm so glad that God didn't didn't didn't say ok according to your because you swore yeah we will hold him what you know swearing I'm you know I'm bad he didn't base my salvation on what I promised to do for him Oh God if you just saved me I do this how many of us has come too short we all have amen and our greatest efforts we're failures or than say we were born failures mmm it takes the grace of God both that's why I'm so happy you may not understand I am happy in my soul amen I am happy because I realize by God's grace it is not by works it is by the grace of God don't you understand me it's because he choose he has chosen to have favor with me not because I deserve it not because you think it's goodness he's no I always always like to go to the starting I'm almost done I like go to the start where they said there was no one worthy to take the book or the lucency is there uh out of all those great prophets out of all the things they had done of course I'm not we're nowhere on the scale but but I heard a message the other day when brother man said I just reached my goal I've just reached in honey said I just reached in other words he says I've got two million souls I've won to the Lord already 2 million so 2 million 2 million understand this but understand this God gave him however million he won to the Lord it was not William Branham it was God now I want you to understand every soul you went to God it's not you but God rewards you because you allowed him to use your body these are all brothers that can't be right it is because when when when Jesus is stepped forward what did those 24 elders do they took the crown all threw them down and they fell to the floor what would they say every work every honor that I have ever received my sitting here my being here my crown everything has come because you did it he did it and God rewards us because whosoever will he wants your will and he rewards you for allowing him to use your body even though he made it think about it into God if God ordained you today would you want win one soul that one soul to God is just like brother Barron's millions because you fulfill your purpose it's the truth you know we look and I thought like that law that weird the time of gleaming even if I had a designer when thousands there's not thousands up there but as long as I'm gleaming loudly pick up five or six and that's what I was a day to do he was saying well done good and faithful servant aren't you happy about that you said what I want a large portion of heaven I don't know about you but I got me a lot you said what do you mean my portion is larges as large as brother branham's what because if you see receive a prophet a prophet you see the prophecy it might have been so small but my small part is just as valuable is if somebody with a big chunk right it's the truth everybody that got over there with Joshua was the reward Canaan was reward Joshua was the captain right and look at Moses even though he didn't make it Moses took him to that place and all that Joshua inherited Moses inherited listen I'm closing on this he says how many feels just all ready to go he said oh isn't that wonderful if the trumpet sound what difference does it make we drop a cross and receive a crown we can't fail I love hearing that can't when it comes to that kind of thing God already accepted us oh I want to be accepted know if you got the Holy Ghost he's already accepted you he said to spirit his spirit is here with us doing performing acting just exactly what he said would take place aren't you glad that God called you then you can feel sorry for those don't condemn them but feel sorry for those whose eyes are closing can't see it they cannot see it unless God knew they would see it before the foundation of the world for all he foreknew he called those we called he justified those who he is justified he had glorified already is written in the book Christ come to redeem those who God by foreknowledge knew that would receive him a man and abet isn't a wonderful thing hey I accepted Christ that eight it is Christ accepting you and to know that there are we are this afternoon just at the end time and all these great things happening and here we are safely in Christ your life proves it now if your life don't tally up to it you're deceived that's right but if you see it understand praising God for it your life is full of righteousness of God it ain't hard for you to do something like that see so you and I must understand when you this is what people where they fail you know we fail in the sense that we don't realize that the work has already been done and how thing is that when John saw the lamb he rejoiced he didn't say well what must I do to make it he saw he made it and he began to rejoice we're so much that all heaven and earth and everything heard John saying now my thought is this when a true revelation has come to your heart with this message it's done for you it will cause a joy unspeakable it will cause you to rejoice at times when everything is whipping on you you can still have a joy you can still rejoice you might be impressed but you still can say thank you Jesus see it transform you because your life is now in heavenly places and when you in heavenly places there ain't nothin joy the Bible said when you are in his presence their joy there's flawless of joy see and what it is we need to know that we need to know that the faith that we we sit we claim to have will give you vision will make you break into another dimension because you believe yeah faith will caused that dimension to come to you right they believed that they was going to have a deliverer hallelujah there were the Jews believing that a deliverer was going to come their faith reached out grab that delivering called him Moses see that that's what faith will do in a take was in that other dimension that unseen and you know the Bible said that unseen RAM is that one that's more real than any other right those things that are unseen were there before the scene right so it's not that we made this from that we made this from that somebody had a vision of it and what we're seeing here is in another dimension you say all that a to it is because when brother Branham had that dream there was a horse there was his chair there was a mansion there was a lot of things in that dimension he said the Brando's ain't never had a mansion where you got one man hallelujah it was always there hallelujah the mansion was waiting on William Branham the horse and the dog see and so we said what do you mean that same dog that came to wood that was brother Branham saw that dog had life in the other of the dimension everlasting whatever you call it I don't know what God gives the animals with all I know they were there so that dog God took that same dog brought him in this dimension he became William branham's dog so when that dog got died guess where he went where he came from back got it see how big it is only people but everything that came from God goes back to God he lose nothing nothing this this fall in time and Sid doesn't doesn't bankrupt God or cause God to go in some kind of creating a red or something no put it away the way God does it God took a job job children came job children was with Joe before he came this way when Joe children died though they were sinners they were there hi cuz Joe had an atonement he offered the blood and because of Joe's blood and faith faith in the blood his children were saved Oh somebody help me here see so you you gotta understand you got ahold faster your faith your family is depending upon you they won't get there without you they may not be bribed but they'll be there I really believe that I believe that God told the Prophet all that love you and you love will be there I believe that he's a prophet I get the same reward all they love me and all that I love will be there I believe that Deborah can take that I've seen some things on that en so no the devil can't take that you know and when you see things when you see things you gotta really believe sometimes God would give you something you said I don't know I know what I saw I know what I'm looking at that's how we say it I can't doubt no matter what it looks like I can't I know God is gonna do it because I don't know what I seen but I saw it you know you've seen it in another dimension so you can't put your finger on it but you know it's there you know it's if God is giving it to you it's like your victory or you know I I don't know how to put it but somehow God gives you an assurance gives you we call it faith but gives you that revelation it's going to happen just like I asked right [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh he has a foundation open up the weed can he do yes he go everyone move oh he is a the foundation of the way run Bo any new he lose the sea [Music] [Applause] [Applause]
