she [Music] she must do exactly what she he would do if he was here on the earth did i come up here this morning because it has fallen my lot here to preach a message this morning it's been my position [Music] [Music] at the end of the book hey man so let's just uh let's as we get into the message this morning we're going to open up to the book of isaiah chapter 29. want to put them on the screen you're more than welcome it might help a little bit really positively won't bother me a bit but we're going to read from isaiah 29 we'll start with uh verse 11. it's good to be back here in des moines i've missed every one of you and uh there's something about you know we've moved up to michigan and we've been michigan we've met a lot of precious brothers and sisters in christ up there become our birthday boys and friends and uh people that we look forward to spending all of eternity with dejean but that does not lessen one bit the bonds of love that we have for the church here in des moines iowa affection the love that we feel for each one of you has not dampened one ayat it's just good to be here so let's let's just lay at this moment lay our thinking lay down all of our thoughts lay down all of our ideas to say wherever two or three are gathered in my name i will be right there in the midst of you to that one we are going to to to pray and to read we also know that in the word there is a transforming oh amen so let's just read from isaiah chapter 29 it says the and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed in and the book is delivered to him that is not learned hallelujah saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned now we're going to stop right there but we will continue on in this chapter here in a little where we can gather together we know lord that this is your secret lord and we pray father you would open up the eyes of our heart see you plainly for who you are and we just thank you father for all things in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen amen you can be seated there was a time where the people would gather together to a book that was sealed no i i i i just want to say you know there there has been times where people have guessed at this book they've wandered at it they've turned the pages back and forth they they ponder whether it means this or means that and you can see the evidence of it all around as people have taken uh 900 different ideas of what this book means and you can take uh just take the the doctrine of the baptism of the holy ghost now the one person will say that when you take the holy eucharist allah you take your confirmation classes and then they they sprinkle the water on you then they lay hands on you and they say they are confirming the holy spirit upon you can confirm that you now have that holy spirit that has been promised for me but you know all of those different ideas none of them stop god one bit and there has been uh the church has gone to a very dark age think about where the church was a thousand years ago hundreds of years of men taking this word and just haphazardly giving it out and mixing in the doctrines of men and different ideas the book was sealed who can understand it now i want to tell you that there that when the book is sealed then it does something to the people when the book is closed god's field of wheat is not transformed to the field it's supposed to be the the the transformation let's go down down in that same chapter is isaiah 29. enough verse 17. he's continuing on in this same thought same thought you continue but he begins to change direction just a little bit direction and he begins to describe what happens when the book is unsealed and he says is it not a very little while i mean something's coming soon is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field should be esteemed as a forest and in that day oh there is a day and in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book the eyes of the blind shall begin to see out of obscurity and out of darkness the the the enamel the meek also verse 19 shall increase their joy in the lord the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel habit when things begin to get a little dark he'll only let it go for so long it says in the world if you go back and you read actually in the in the in the hebrew there it says and the world became dark you couldn't discern anything about it it wasn't the condition that god had in his mind before the foundation of the world and the earth being in that condition according to any man's idea anywhere no no no no no no no this is god himself that's the jewel remember this is the holy spirit of the living god and his creation has become void and dark and formless so he begins to brood over the darkness now i want you to consider what was the end result of his brooding we know that the animals sprung up we know that a great light starts shining on the earth we know that that grass began to come up out of the dirt we know all those things oh those were great we know that that uh the giraffes begin to wander across the earth and here's mr mrs giraffe here's a mr mrs lyon tiger and all those things and those things are great things great things great shows but the holy spirit was not done brooding because it had not yet come to the vision the holy spirit will always keep brooding until it comes to the place that he had in the vision formed out of the dust of the earth and god began to speak out and all of a sudden this man stood up very creator has poured himself into a his life into a body the life of the creator was being put into a body we know that god likes to do that he likes to put his life into our body that's been his desire all along to put his life into a body upon this earth he'd been commuting and commuting and commuting and he was uh just a chip off the old block when god had a thought do you have in ponce adam had a thought that his sons and daughters will be just like him this is says i want you to name all the animals i want you to consider their characteristics could you consider the characteristics which do you consider everything about them i want you to examine them look at every part of them look at their characteristics look at their mindsets look at the look at the end of the emotions look at every single part of them don't and all these things everyone with its counterpart male and female male and female male and female female and he went and he did everything that god told him to do well one thing all that amongst all of that here god had given him that commandment reproduce and multiply remember but when he began to see male and female male and female male and female and all throughout creation god have been saying it is good it is good it is good but here comes adam and eve god says it is not good that man should dwell alone dude and so god takes adam and he puts him to sleep reaches down onto the inside of adam [Music] bring them on down through the centuries call them the jews the the siege they took the pillar of fire the tablets of stone the meant to go into that promised land and take over but instead they dragged it to the wilderness for 40 years and they turn the power of god into a religion he's on faith yeah that's just like me that's just like what man does this fondly zombie they take the power of god and they turn it into a religion that's and after now think about it there was 2 000 years from adam until about moses or abraham's time and they turned the garden of eden into a religion they did all these things and the egyptians did what they did and the sumerians did what they did and every tribe of the earth did what they had to do with the power of god in the garden of eden god came again and sent a second atom to the earth and this second adam he he he he came upon this earth but if you say i don't even know god was coming down himself he formed himself a a body of flesh he's he spoke a word into the womb of mary he said he was born there by that spoken word creation all over again the word was spoken in the beginning and created a garden of eden yeah the he begins to attack that religion yeah whereas men take the power and spirit of god and they turn it into a form of man made religion they didn't know what to do with jesus they didn't know what to do with him one time jesus he was going he's preaching through all the tabernacles around israel we don't know what this man is preaching it doesn't it doesn't match what our schools of theology says the the the teachings of this man jesus there's no sin it doesn't match what the scribes say listen it doesn't match what the doctors say is the doctor but you know he just kept preaching all the same things he came he did just exactly what he was had to do unbelief does not hinder god one bit you can believe or you can disbelieve he got to this little church way up in the north this little synagogue he went in there he was going to have a church service but the pharisees had heard about him being up there they gathered in there and the house was filled with pharisees filled with sadducees i hope we don't have that around here now when you read in the gospels when it begins to describe that church service it says and the power of the lord was present to heal of any of those pharisees or sadducees being healed there is no testimony they didn't come out of there with a powerful testimony what god had done for the bible says the power of the lord was present to heal them there is no record of any other testimony now there were some men in that area oh there were some men in there they had a friend that was sick yes again could you visit this on purple and there's something about it when you realize that you're in a day where god is in the day of god's visitation in your mind [Music] that if i could ever live in bible days again so these four these four faithful friends they had their they had their their their friend that he couldn't walk so they put him on this little cot oh you know this is yours and they carried him on the poles and they're gonna go to church and get him into the presence of god's visitation amen but the thing of it was when they got to church when god has something in his mind that he's going to do now he's going to raise up stones under himself to praise him he failed to believe him exactly how the word says to believe him we can't receive christ the same yesterday today forever is here's the solution to all their problems they couldn't get him because of the the pharisees in the church above the platform i'm sure it caused a lot of commotion they might not have had very good church orders the very first thing he saw was not the cut it was not the sick man wasn't even the four people there it wasn't the ropes [Applause] the jewish now we know christ is going to have a bride a man is going to marry a man farmer that's just the way of creation every seed must bring forth of its kind especially in space so now i don't want to stumble you here will this bride of christ be amen now it's just to open up some of the scriptures now we had a time of day when this book was sealed but when the book begins to open then a fruitful field begins to appear and the garden of eden returns when the book is unveiled you begin to see scriptures in there that maybe men have taken in a religious way in the times past but and in six days god created the heavens and the earth and now in 6 000 years i mean it's time for something to take place it's time for the finishing act of creation it's time for the finishing act of creation don't you see that satan thought he interrupted the finishing act of creation he thought that god had taken himself and put himself in a weak body bring it to a tarnation make it so unclean that god could never live in it bit doesn't hinder god's plan when jesus was here on the earth old jehovah was putting himself in a weak body again he didn't exactly know what jesus was he thought he might be another prophet he wasn't sure but he'd never seen signs and wonders like this before this is a little bit higher than isaiah a little bit higher than what jeremiah was saying that david god worked in him pretty powerfully but this is this is another step here it got into the pharisees into the church world reversing every curse that was put on adam's race the earth will bear thorns and thistles and then they took jesus and they put a crown of thorns on them now let me tell you when jesus cried out on the cross and said it is finished he wasn't joking he knew exactly what he was saying and for some reason the church of god despite the finishing act of jesus christ on the cross jesus marched out and they went deep down into a dark age a thousand years of misery to take the power of god and upon the poisson just bury it in the earth but you know unbelief doesn't hinder god god's plans just keep marching right on right continue each one of us has a an opportunity opportunity a decision point decision to decide jesus christ was the second adam jesus christ but he was the real true son of god he was god himself saved by the blood of a man and he says into thy hands i commit my spirit is recreating a bride of christ upon the earth and there has been age after age now when you get to the book of revelations the the thyatira church there in revelations chapter 2. that was prophesying of that dark age he says i will put no other burden upon you just to you that haven't known the depths of satan i'm just speaking to those that haven't known the depths of satan i won't put any other burden upon you but then you turn to the laodicean church so that layer to see in church was prophesying of a last day other people that would be lukewarm formless void without shape and he would give them a great challenge that's speaking of our days now there's got to be someone that hears that challenge there's got to be someone that hears that now many of the 12 tribes they they heard about the promised land you know joshua wrote in a book every part of their inheritance surveyors out to survey the land to mark the boundaries of each tribe and they said uh the land that you gave to us is too [Music] now josh who i got pretty puzzled because you know i wrote that book just the way the pillar of fire told me to ride it turn the pages say well all the way down to hit reuben's territory go cut down them trees don't destroy that enemy because you said you were a strong people you had a big drive then you are more than able to conquer them how the spirit of the lord god told him to write it and he'd get written out that the portion for dan was right next to jerusalem uh to where jesus christ was going to come but you know they got to a place where that inheritance was just a little too hard if you ever look at the maps of the tribes of israel way up top at the north that's not where joshua told them to be it first starts talking about there in judges seventeen eight don juice he was looking for a place where he could get a a paid salary to be faster and then he found a a house that was full of idols and the man that had the house he he had all the idols but he didn't have a priest to to bow down into these idols when he saw this levi went by that was looking for a paycheck anymore jerusalem i could just worship right here you know it pays to worship where god is being revealed it pays to worship wherever the open book is route what was the upper room it was eden being recreated so they this man he got this lazy priest dan was beginning to realize that their inheritance was just too hard for him and they heard about this place way up in the north borderland where lazy people was dwelling on vive so the lazy tribe tribute and as they're leaving they found this lazy priest at this house they killed the owner of the house and they says you're going to come and you're going to be our priest the lazy land foreign it labels every tribe that that 144 000 comes from the tribe isn't there like now we're living in a day when we've had our 2000 years now the jews had the revealing of jesus christ the samaritans had the revealing of jesus christ you know we're living in a day but the gentiles they they didn't have that revealing now we're coming to the end we're coming to the end of time and the church is in no condition i've seen it you've seen it [Music] angels get into the church and it completely destroyed the church of god nevertheless there remains a promise laying here that promise has been sealed for so so and we've been rejoicing knowing that we are god's creations we've been rejoicing knowing that we are god's people but you know everybody has an opportunity to enter into god's promises now the enemy will be in the land you know you can be a dan or you could be a caleb there's got to be someone that's going to inherit this problem now i don't know about you but when i listen to brother braham's sermons there is something that took place there that's different there is something that took place there that's different now i i've read through the the the the you know uh jeremiah i've read there i've read uh martin luther i've read god i'm glad god did what he did in those days now see what god did church made back there in the dark ages so god sent a martin luther church and then he sent a john wesley to raise the church up out of there it's higher it's getting higher it's getting higher azusa street you know he's right here in the 50s and 60s when brother brown was preaching now when i listen to those tapes oh no when i listen to those tapes and you could say you can hear brother braham just preaching a good fine message a powerful message a message that will transform you the day that he's living in basketball there is a people up to a nut to the level that they're supposed to be but when i hear him do something like this please after he's done preaching and also he says you there in the red dress you were praying right before you come in the room you're praying for your husband who lives over in louisville he's sick and he's not a christian go back home there was a power on the inside of him himself to this age to this hour ready for a rapture that's coming soon did exactly what god told him to do jesus christ now don't get too focused on the man here focus on what god is doing behind that man has revealed himself in a supernatural way in this day the house is full of pharisees you can't get in you can't get in to see it belief doesn't hinder god one bit someone's gonna see that get confident there must be a people that are getting ready to inherit a promise that has been laid up a sword in ages and ages now there can be some people will take it in a lazy way some people could say well i'll just take the easy part of the land where the enemy is i'm not going to take that and they begin to flip through the pages and it's it's no longer sealed to them they begin to they begin to see who jesus christ is jesus but not just who jesus christ but the bride has to become to a position where she realizes who she is inheritance unless you look at it by faith and say lord i need that for god he said that there came in 21 9 he says there came to me enough one of the seven angels which had the seven vials of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither madrid now when is this wife going to be revealed you see the book was sealed back in the dark ages i know i know yeah and he'd heard about the power of jesus christ he had seen the power of jesus christ but as he was standing on that boat and he washed that spirit walking on the water he saw jesus walking on water well how close can the creation get to god and how much closer can his people get to it well how much closer can his sons and daughters get to him and now he began to sink yeah and it turned from wanting to walk on water now he needed to walk he needed the power of jesus christ you can you can look at jesus from a distance all day long admire his mighty works you can admire all of these but let me tell you if there is a bride to our lord and savior there's got to be someone that's walking with him step by step paul said that we are flesh with his flesh paul i didn't share bone of his bones and we've had all the denomination ideal denominational ideas of what it meant to be the body of christ in the future developing i'll tell you that little portion of this is just as powerful as the fault you know and let me tell you i'm not going to be one that stands back but let me tell you melissa amen jesus christ seed he went the word he went down into the earth now sc now just here in closing i know i've taken a long time let's just go over to ephesians real quick ephesians chapter 4 this will be my last scripture in verse 8 he said wherefore when he ascended up on high. he led captivity captive now i'm glad he did praise god he did that i needed that now what do these gifts do if there's gifts given to man how can we benefit from it what's the end result of those gifts upon the church there's a couple reasons here reason number one for the perfecting of the saints now the english word perfect it's kind of complicated we say perfect and we think oh never making a mistake that there is complete me completion for the completion of the church to come it's a complete it's whole so it's a complication for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry um the love for the minister and the edifying of the body of christ now if those gifts are given to us then there's got to be someone that's going to stand up and say yo then god has given me something that i can come back come to completion wherever he had in his mind before the foundation of the world so the body of christ could be edified now how long are these gifts going to be in operation how long will these today did they end at the day of pentecost did they end when john the bat when john the revelator died these gifts will be operating until next week it's the body of christ until we the body all come in the unity of the faith so we know it's going to be gleason until that so we all come into the unity of faith and that's part of our inheritance now it belongs to us just understand and to the knowledge of the son of god oh yeah yeah i know jesus came oh yeah sure sure sure i know i know oh it's church these there's more to jesus christ than that yeah there's more to jesus christ than that yeah we will speak with all of eternity coming to the knowledge and unto a measure of the stature of the fullness of christ now if these things are given to us look at your own cells now i'm not here to preach a pitchfork religion well that's your brother so-and-so and that was so so nothing wrong down into your heart no do you know what jesus is doing right now in this hour you know they all had lamps it didn't matter whether they were wise or whether they're physical and psalms says thy word oh lord as a lamp unto my feet they all had a time when their word was working for him they had a time where their word was working there was a time when luther's message was working there was a time when wesley's message was working the church says is she knew that there had to that if her if her aunt if her lamp ever began to get low of oil that she knew she had to know the place of the refilling she had again she kept it right by her side she washed it she wouldn't even let anybody else get nervous version came to get something because she knew she had a duty and this is what her duty was is it to shine the light all the way to the wedding all the way to the wedding supper of the land just goes to speak shine the light shine the light that burning word that revealed words things that god said amen so she finally begins to look just like he looks
