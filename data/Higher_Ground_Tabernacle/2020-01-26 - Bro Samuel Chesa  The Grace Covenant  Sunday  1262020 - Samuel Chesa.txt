your anointing in our merest so that in the end of it all we might be blessed and we'll come unto you love with our hearts full of Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name I pray believing amen whilst we were standing let's just open our Bibles to the book of Genesis chapter 17 read from the first verse and when Abraham was 90 years old in nine the Lord appeared to Abram to Abraham and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply the exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shall be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make the exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after after the India generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after the the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham thou should keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in the generations Amen may the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word we might take our seat in the passage of Scripture we'll just read the reading when God came down and he gave Abraham a covenant and he changed Abraham Abraham's name from Abraham to Abraham because we know the prophet of God told us that he was giving part of him which God was Elohim the self-existent one and when he gave part of himself to Abraham he changed his name from Abram to Abraham and as we were reading God was giving a covenant to Abraham and his seed thereafter and we know a covenant modern day would probably call it a promise or a contract that's what we would call it in this in this modern day so God just came and he gave this covenant to Abraham when we read in the previous chapters we never heard of anything special that Abraham did God just came straight to him he just chose him by grace and he said I want to give you this covenant amen that's what Grace has done for us that's what grace is all about we don't deserve no mercy we didn't we don't deserve no nothing but just God with his amazing grace he elected you he elected me a man so we see Abraham did not ask for this promise we don't see where anything he did a great deed or where he did something really good and God said I want to reward you with this covenant from what we read Abraham he was just a hidden who in the earth of the Chaldeans he was there he was just a he'd hidden worshipping idols knew nothing about God but God just came to him and he said pick your things and start going and he just selected him so that his election by grace hallelujah so this morning just for a couple of minutes we want to talk on the subject the Grace Covenant amen so when we read it we see that grace is unmerited favor just being favored by God for doing nothing hallelujah we were in our sins doing things whatever we were doing but God with his favor he just saw you and he says that's the one I want and there's justification he justified us and he took us and changed our names so as we were reading in in Genesis we saw that God said I want to give you this covenant and this covenant is between you and me and it applies to the two your seed which are the generations that come after Abraham so this contract a promise was not only ending with Abraham but Israel it was extended to come unto all his generations - the seed that comes after him and this this contract was unconditional it was God who said I am the one who is giving you this I'm not giving you this because you deserve it or I'm not doing this to say after you do this that's when I'll do this for you because God every time he had a covenant a conditional covenant with man men always couldn't keep their end when God will say if you do this I will do this for you men always failed so God was so determined to let this come through so he said I am now swearing by myself and this covenant is it is from me and I am the one who is giving it it is unconditional no matter what you do no matter what happens no matter what comes your way whatever the decision you make my covenant with you does not change my covenant with you still say the same because he so much wanted to save man he didn't want the redemption plan to go sideways he saw if I let men come into the equation this whole plan will be disrupted so that's why he said I am the one I swear by myself and it is an unconditional covenant you don't have to do nothing I am the one who is fully responsible for this promised over this contract amen so we see that now this this promise comes to it it comes down unto us all the seed of Abraham and we know that the natural seed of Abraham is a is Israel is that right so the prophet of God tells us that this covenant came in with grace because many times we think that the Old Testament is fully the law and the New Testament is only grace but when we read we see that it was Grace at first before the low came because the low is that is it comes and he says if you do this you will be punished an eye for an eye if you commit a sin you have to you you have to pay for it if you commit murder you have to be murdered but we see before the law of circumcision came which was which was the law in the Old Testament it was grace that brought a that brought Abraham into the covenant with God I read what the prophet of God says and he says and Abraham never received this promised while he was in circumcision under the law but when he was under grace before circumcision was ever issued therefore it's nothing it's not nothing that we could do to merit it it's God's grace that gives it to us by faith abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteous the law is what men wanted not what God wanted so we see the lo came into place because that's what men wanted because men did not want God's grace but God's initial plan His perfect will was Grace for his children hallelujah so we see now that God brought in Abraham God brought in Abraham with Grace and he wanted the same for Abraham's seed we know Paul in the old in the New Testament he tells us that Christ in Galatians he says Christ is the seed of Abraham that God promised to him when he when he promised him a son when he promised him that the Covenant would extend to his seed he was talking about Jesus Christ we know the Old Testament times the New Testament so Isaac was a type of Christ but what God really meant he was pointing to Jesus Christ as a royal seed of Abraham so this is where the promise extended to so now we know that for us to become the seed of Abraham we have to be born again saved and received the Holy Ghost when we were born amen the man or woman who is filled with the Holy Ghost is a child of Abraham is the seed of Abraham so the moment you become the seed of Abraham you are part of the Covenant you are a beneficiary of the Covenant a beneficiary of the promise you know if there is if there is a title deed that describes an inheritance and it has it has your name in it by virtue of being in that lineage by virtue of you being a son or a daughter that is described in that in that our title deed you become a beneficiary of that inheritance so we know we were once castaways but because of God's grace he brought us in and he cleansed us and he called his sons and daughters of God and he brought us in into the royal family and now we can say we are the seed of Abraham so by virtue of that you and me we are now under we are now under the promise we had we are described in this title deed so we are heirs to this covenant that God made with Abraham because we are the seed of Abraham through crisis that right hallelujah because we did nothing to deserve this covenant you and I we clearly no we did nothing for us to be saved we did not deserve it you know you were hanging out with your friends doing the same things but God just came and he hand-picked you and he say you that's the one I want you did nothing no not any deeds or nothing but he just said I want you why that is election so God decided to take you clency and he called you a son and he called you a daughter because he just loved you by His amazing grace hallelujah so this amazing grace he just came and it located you the prophet of God calls it justification you know it's being picked out out of out of many and you just say I just want that one not that you have done anything good or nothing but it is just the grace of God so now we can come in before the presence of God we stand in holy which then in justified because of His grace that he gave unto us so God had to do this by himself he did not want men disrupting his plan so that's why he made this covenant and he swore by himself to say this I will do no matter what you do I am going to save you so tonight this morning rather because of the grace because you are saved you cannot fail the New Testament tells us that God never loses those that I his why because it is grace it is a covenant that God made by himself you are know you have nothing to do with it so no matter what wrong you do or no matter what the devil fools you into doing God is not going to impute that to you because you know Abraham righteousness was imputed to him and now when we read in um in the Bible will let us open up in Hebrews chapter 11 the eleventh verse so hebrews chapter six the 13th verse actually hebrews chapter six for when god made promise to abraham because equal to swear by non by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiply I will multiply thee so he so and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise we know Abraham when we are reading in the when we were reading in The Chronicles of Abraham it says that Abraham walked perfect before God but we all know when we looking at the facts and what and what was read that he is a life account we saw all the Lions that he did and all the wrong things that he did but when we come where his account was read it does not talk about all that he does not talk about all that it just says Abraham waiver not staggered not unto the promises of God why it was because it was God's covenant it was grace that had already it it says that it says the the end from the beginning so no matter what you do because simply because we are justified and God elected us before the foundation of the world we are not impute sin is not imputed to us because we are justified justified means just as if you never did it before so when the devil comes and point out and you say look your son was doing this this and this before God says no they never did it in the first place because sin is not imputed to them sin is not imputed to us but righteousness despite all the life despite all the wrong ings that you do but no sin is imputed not sin is imputed to you and me is that right so thus does what God has done for us because it is whatever wrong that you have done the devil God accuses the devil of that because it is the devil who made you do it but you did not intend to do it because you are a child of God you made a mistake but that mistake is not your fault it is the devil's fault this is what the grace covenant does for us so we will never fail no matter what wrong and you do when we come to God to confess it he cleans he cleans it clean I was late and we can come in holy and clean before God you see one thing God is not able to do is remember sins he cannot he cannot remember it if you do something today you come to God so since here in the contrite heart you repent to God God will put it in the sea of forgetfulness and he will not remember it you see us people are the ones who have the tendency of remembering if you do something then you you repent to God then you come back again you do something again you repent when you are trying to focus on your relationship with God then Satan starts pointing it the things you've done saying you look at that you are not the son look at that you are not a Christian because he's pointing at the memory but if you think about yourself the way God thinks about you you will know that that has that that is gone as if you never did it because we are justified so Abraham for this covenant to come into effect Abraham had to obey God if he had not obeyed the calling that God had given unto him this covenant was not going to be in effect he was going to remain in the land of the he was going to remain in the earth of the Chaldeans if he had not obeyed God so for this covenant to come into place to come into play and be effective Abraham had to listen to God he had to obey him and come out and stir he started following wherever God led him you see we call Abraham the father of faith because he was going to a place he didn't know he moved his whole household moved everything and started going to a prom the land way he had never had before if you can if I can ask you this morning how many are able to do it this morning God tells you just pick everything and stand for he says follow me just that going you leave your house you pack everything and then your whole family and not to return just to go where are you going I don't know I'm going I'm just going no one in their right mind will seemingly do that but this is the type of faith that Abraham had he believed in God when he heard that calling it was because he was elected before the foundation of the world so he could not do decline this call that God had on him so he packed up everything took his whole family he took his uh-oh his livestock and everything and he started moving he started walking just following God looking for a city whose builder and maker is God amen the promised land he had been given by God but he didn't know where he was going so this is the type of faith we are supposed to have for this because this covenant it applies to us for is for it to be if in effect we have to do like what our father Abraham did we have to fully obey when God when God called us we we obeyed we came out of the world we left our our things whatever that we were doing just like our father Abraham and this Grace Covenant is in effect to us is that right so that's what we ought to do leave ourselves just get out of the way and let let God work in us and just let God have full preeminence for this covenant to be in full effect you see this covenant will never fail us so just the same way as he honored the Covenant with our father Abraham if we do exactly like our Father what like what our father Abraham did God will do the same for us so because we know Abraham held on to that covenant he held on to that promise no matter what a lot of people said we know he was promised by God to have a son and we know he spent 25 years looking forward to that son and people asked him he would go around and he say I am a father of Nations although we knew that he had no he had no son he had no child at all after 10 years people come in he say and they say we are your children father of Nations you see he was not saying I'm a father of a family or a father of a tribe he was saying I'm a father of a whole of Nations not a nation but he had he had no evidence to point at but we know that faith is the substance of things hoped for he was holding on to what God had told him after 15 years they would come back again and they say father of Nations how are you doing and he said I'm doing fine that Sun is coming 20 years down the line and he was getting old mind you he was he was getting really old because when he received the promises he was probably around 75 years old and he was aging 90 years father of father of Nations he has no son at all and Sarah was aging as well and as time went on that's when his faith kept on maturing because he was believing in God he knew that although 20 years have passed he knew that God will never fail he knew that God had put himself onto the Covenant and he had sworn by himself because there was no one greater so he knew that God's promise was going to come to pass despite whatever it was so when he came after 25 years eventually we know the promised son came but we know before that Sarah had caused who Sarah due to unbelief he had here she had a she had facilitated for Ishmael to come in and we know Ishmael was a product of unbelief but despite that God said no does not the promise I made for you he kept on holding on he said through Sarah that's what my products where my promise is going to come true and after 25 years we saw Isaac came in as it came into existence it was because Abraham kept on holding to that covenant because he knew God never fails you see that's the thing with election many people stumble when they hear the word election or predestination I know some say then God is cruel why does he choose some and he does not choose some so that means God is a he's a God of favor but you see election and predestination is like God put all of us when he created man when he created Adam and Eve he put them on a basis of moral free moral agency where somebody chooses whatever they want you see so God gives God gives each and every one of us a choice but now simply because He is God he knows the end from the beginning he knew the choice that you were going to make before before he brought you here on earth that's why he predestinated you he chose you because he knew when the message when the word of God was going to come your way you are going to accept it he knew you were going to receive it you are not going to deny it I'll give probably an example if you are a father and you know you have maybe three or four kids then you want to go somewhere you know that some of your kids maybe two of them they're like traveling at you some of them to just like staying at home they don't they don't want to go out with you when you maybe you want to go somewhere and when you come and you say you really know these two like going these two does not and you say you come and you ask all of them you say who wants to go with me but you know these two exactly are going to come and these two are going to stay but you are not going to be unfair and you just call this two and you say maybe less let's say it's John and Jess you say John and Jess let's go then you leave the other two that's going to be unfair right but all of them they are right there you say who wants to go with me but now simply because you are the father you know the desires of the of your children you know their passions what they like and what they don't like you were just going to see who wants to go with me and those two are going to get up and they will come with you have you been unfair you gave them free moral agency they decided so that's what election and predestination with God is like he knew who was going to accept and who was going to reiden I it so that's how he chose you and me and he did not choose the other ones we did not because He is God he he is omniscient he knows everything the end from the beginning so that's what predestination and election is all about there is no favoritism but it is that God knows he knew your choice before you came here and he knew the per that that other person was going to deny the word when it was going to come unto them so God is not he is not using favor he is using foreknowledge to do his selection that's so he used that's what he used to give out to give unto us grace because we know we were so simply because now we are elected we cannot be deceived we have a promise in Matthew that says if it will deceive the very elect if it were possible but we thank God that it is not possible so we cannot fail if God elected you don't look at any mistake you made don't look at any wrong ings you did or anything maybe your life seems like it's going turning around and going in a different direction simply because you are elected you cannot be deceived I will promise you simply because you elected you are going to make it because God loses none of him of that that I he's you see we were elected sealed before the foundation of the world before even the cross of Calvary we were sealed we won the back part of God's mind he knew he knew what we were going to be placed so he elected us before the foundation of the world and we know so he put our lamps in the in the Lamb's Book of Life already before we were born before he even sada let there be light we were there he had already put our names in the lamp section in the book of life and so that's when he had called us his children so we were we were already we had already received this grace covenant before the foundation of the world when he slew his the lamp is the back part of his mind his loo his lamp Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world before the creation so and we know that 4000 years later after time started being counted that's when he that's when he crucified his son he decided to take his lamb to look onto the cross of Calvary and that's when he says but he stripes we were healed not we are going to be healed but we were healed and by his arm we know he was wounded for our transgressions so our transgressions old all the sins that you were going to make after you were born God saw that and he knew it so that's why 2000 years ago he decided to he decided to kill a lamb his own son and so that to pardon you of the sins you were going to do so all the ones that you did and he forgave you of and the ones that you are still going to do he already forgave all of those ones 2000 years ago and whatever sickness that kind of tries to come and knock on your doorstep he was striped for that because the Bible said by His stripes we were healed or not we are healed or going to be healed but it was done way before you came here you see God when God wants to create fish he creates water first before where he can put the fish God creates a solution before the problem so before he knew you were going you wanted to be healed so before you even came here he or he had already made an atonement for your healing so there is nothing that can there is nothing that can stop your healing because you know it was done already you have to do is accept it all you have to do is to receive it because it was and it was already it done work and he was wounded for our transgressions you see Satan does not have the right to come and tell you you done wrong because when he was wounded then it was done when he cried it is finished that he everything was done everything was finished oh you're wrong ings all your evil doings that you were going to do or that you think you have if you just repented to God it is gone it is finished because he done that for us he put it into play 2,000 years ago but it was done before the foundation of the world because that's when he that's that's when he created us so there is no condemnation within us do not let the devil condemn you and he say you are not going to make it or he tries to bring you down and steal the salvage the joy of your salvation do not allow that because you see you know that God already got already pardoned to you and he he already done that for you so there is no condemnation for us so you see the prophecies there is no preacher that can heal you all oh there is no one even praying for you does not heal you it is just a means of rise raise in your faith so that you get to believe and understand that that's what Jesus already done for you you already healed before so all you have to do is to believe and to accept it you see like I say for the covenants to be in effect you have to accept it you have to obey so all you have to do is to remember you say God he did it he healed me back then and you raised your faith and you believe it it and it will be done you will be able to say it is finished when you believe it hallelujah amen so we know that arm the Old Testament was a type of the New Testament and if would the ancient ways we know we know nowadays when you are signing a contract or you come into an agreement or you have a business deal when you agree with somebody you shake hands to to agree and say this is you are going to honor your word I am going to own them my word this is the modern way of doing things but in the ancient days what they used to do they will take they will take a sheepskin and then they have their covenants written on their sheepskin because back then they didn't have paper and everything so in the in the ancient times they would have a sheepskin and ride the Covenant on the sheepskin after writing that covenant they would tear it apart and then one person would go with the other piece of the sheepskin or animal skin and the other one would go with the other piece as a sign for the Covenant because if you would bring these two pieces together it is only this piece that can complete this one and it is only this piece that can complete this one so this is how they used to make that that's the way they used to make their covenants contracts you see the prophet of God said there is only one thing with them contract come together them letters the way they were taught they had to dovetail every letter and every piece of toward every piece there was tear the sheepskin it had to doubt tale right together nothing could substitute it it had to be just exactly the same in the confirmation of this if they brought another piece and try to make it ah it wouldn't blend in with it it just had to blend just the way it was so you see when these people would go separate places even if this person dies these when there may be there may be their son or whomever would have taken up the inheritance they would be able to come in because they have a sign of the Covenant that was made and the other side they have they have it so they will be able to match up to see that day is no scamming that has been made these are the exact people who did it so we see now the Grace Covenant that God made when he made it with when he made it with Abraham we know that Abraham was just a shadow we know the Old Testament is just a shadow of what was really going to happen in the New Testament is that right so now God the prophet tells us the Prophet tells us that what God did now he wanted to the Covenant that he made with Abraham he made like I said earlier on the Covenant that he made with Abraham he made the same it comes down to his seed we the Royal the Royal seed of Abraham through Christ by receiving the Holy Ghost and by by being saved we become children of Abraham so when God now in the New Testament after the shadow was done and he was bringing the the when he was bringing now the real thing he wanted to make a covenant with us so what he did he brought his son Jesus Christ unto the earth and we know that he poured his spirit into the body he created the corporal body of Jesus Christ that he made he poured his spirit into it and we know Jesus Christ was was God he was the fullness he wasn't evil he was the fullness of God there was dwelled Welling bodily in him so this was God's lamb when he was making the covenant with us he took his son onto the cross of Calvary he took him as a lamb because previously in the Old Testament when they would offer a sacrifice they would kill an animal they would kill a lamb and then they would uh cut it they would cut it open so the shedding of the blood would cover the sins it would just cover but but not to remove them completely there was in the Old Testament but now in the New Testament now the blood of Christ cleanses us it cleanses all the sins it doesn't leave even any speck of cinders the remaining so when Christ when gee when God brought his son into play it was he lamb we all know Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and now he was making this covenant with us the prophet of God tells us that now he killed his a lamp on the cross of Calvary and He shed his blood and by the shedding of his blood we know that's when we are all cleansed before we were even here we were all cleansed and what God done after three days he'd raised the body of Christ and he took the body with him and he said it to set it on the right hand of the Father and after the day of Pentecost he sent back the spirit to the church so that was there the Dera there was the Covenant he was making he told his son apart and after the day of Pentecost he put the Spirit with the church and he took the body back to heaven so this is the dovetailing pieces they had been taken apart from each other which is today so now the church you and me we have the Spirit of God within us and God took the copper of body of Jesus Christ back to heaven so now these two pieces they are supposed to dovetail there is no way they cannot because it is the same piece so the same the same spirit that was in Christ it is supposed to be dwelling in you two this morning the same works that he done are supposed to be done by you and me because it is the exact same copy not a photocopy or a duplicate it is the exact same one that you and I we had that you and I we have this morning when he gave us the Holy Ghost it is the person of Christ Himself coming in within us the same spirit that was in Christ he took it and he said when I am gone I will send a comforter unto you we know he said I go back in what at one point Christ says I go back to the Father and another point he said after I'm gone I'll send a comforter that was himself tearing himself apart giving one piece to the church and one piece going back to heaven so that those are the two pieces of the Covenant so there is no reason why the Church of God cannot do the words that Jesus done because it is the same spirit you see he says greater works than these shall you do why because the same spirit is the same spirit operating in the church it is not you doing it but it is Christ who is doing it within II you and me because it is it is his own spirit hallelujah so the same spirit is supposed to be living in the church so so now what when now God comes back to rupture his church he is not going to look for anything else when he is coming back for the Covenant that he made he is not going to look for any other different peace or listen to any other different story what he is just going to look for is going to look for the dovetailing peace that he gave to the church it has to come in together so you and I this morning we have to make sure that we have the same peace that God that God sent back on the earth that same spirit because the prophet of God tells us that without the Holy Ghost we cannot make it we cannot make it into heaven without the Holy Ghost because this is the only piece that is that makes the Covenant fool the cup of the Covenant that God made with father Abraham and he made with us so the Covenant that he made with us is to receive the Holy Ghost which is Christ himself hallelujah so we know Christ did miracles demons were afraid of Christ because of the Spirit that was within him he performed he healed people so tonight this morning when you come into here you are sick or you have a problem that problem gotta go why because the Spirit of Christ is in action that same spirit is still doing miracles that same spirit is still chasing away demons because when their spirit is around that's why we can sing in the presence of Jehovah all the troubles vanish all the problems I ended because it is that same spirit that is taking over in that presence so this morning I can tell you that presence is here this morning because you said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I will be there so you don't have to look at nothing else because we know that spirit Christ himself in our merest the same part that this this other part that God that God took away with him we have it this morning so when he is going to come to come back to the earth to rapture his bride he is not looking for nothing else but that which he left with you so it is our duty and our mandate for us to make sure we have the right piece because if we have something else and God comes back to take the church it is not going to meet it is not going to dovetail and bring back the original thing so it is our duty to make sure we have what God left us which is the pure which is the pure spirit of Christ amen so the holy sense of the Covenant is for us to receive the Holy Ghost to go through all the to go through all the processes of justification that which we are talking about there was grace it came and picked you up when you were doing whatever you were doing and it's brought you to be called the Son of God and he decided to sanctify you by the shedding of the blood of His Son Jesus Christ he cleansed you to make you clean to make you he said I'll make you as white as snow and he sanctified you after he sanctified you then he decided to come and dwell in you with the spirit of of his son that he sent back on the earth so that's what God is looking for amen so the whole is sense of the Covenant of the grace covenant it is sanctification justification when God chose you sanctification when God decided to cleanse you and giving you the Holy Ghost which is which is the person of Christ himself that's what that's what the Grace Covenant is all about we didn't deserve it but now we can stand and we can call ourselves sons and daughters of God because of what he has done for us so we have to fully obey this covenant that God has with us the covenant of him sending his son to us we gotta accept him we accept him into our life how do we accepting by putting our own self out of the way and saying lord please have full preeminence in my life so that he can come and dwell within us thus the ascent of the whole of the covenant amen by election he knew you were going to accept the word so he brought you in to be cold to be cold bright so when he is going to come back to the earth he's going to come looking for you and that will never fail so we have to accept it for it to have we have to accept the Covenant the Grace Covenant for it to have full effect in our lives we have to live clean and live holy like Christ because people were called Christians as a nickname because Christian they were saying these people they are living like Christ they are talking like Christ that's why they were called Christians so that's what we ought to do this morning because that peace that God gave unto us it is with the church this morning we have to keep it and we have to act like Christians and behave like ones because it is not us living but it is Christ who is living within us so we have to live clean and holy life that are presentable before him so that when God is looking from above he can say that is my son when we are walking full of Christ so that there is no troubles that can come in our way diseases won't be able to stand in our way we can pray and have the faith because we know when we pray things happen we know when we pray miracles happen because we have the Spirit of Christ hallelujah we thank God for His grace we thank God for the grace covenant so we are accepted this morning because that's what he's done for you he wants you to receive it he chose you you had done nothing special but he decided to have the grace covenant with you this morning hallelujah how many want to accept the grace covenant with God let us stand up on our feet may God's holy name be praised amen let us just bow our heads as we Heavenly Father we approach the throne of grace one more time Lord thinking you or Jesus for sending your anointing in our midst thanking you Lord for sending your spirit you know immediate Lord here we come unto you Lord saying father we do not want to deny Lord the Covenant you gave unto us we want to be partakers of this grace covenants Lord the one you sent Christ in our mirrors that's what we want so that it cannot be us living but it will be you living within us because we know in this evil day we cannot make it by ourselves it we know it is only by your spirit that we can make it father so he had Lord look at your children Oh father God we are here Lord yielding ourselves saying father may you have preeminence in our lives we do not want it to be all about us but we want it to be all about you so that when you come Oh father you will find that which you left with us you will find that holy spirit pure clean just the way you gave it to us Oh father so when you come for your bride you will be looking you'll be like you're looking into the mirror you'll be seeing yourselves because you left us a part of yourself father be with us all father we give everything unto you all the praises all the glory and all the honor for it's all on do
