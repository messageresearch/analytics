a testimony that's something that jesus christ has done for you and your eyes have been open in these last days to catch the revelation of what jesus christ has done for you to catch the revelation of how he is healed he has delivered how he has washed now you're going to the east you're going to the north and now you're going to this your direction of your life has been changed oh you're going off horizontally horizontally but now you're going up into the heavens you're in natural places and now you're dwelling in heavenly places we've been given a place up in the heavens we're going to read from the book of luc saint luke chapter 7 hey man i want to preach a message this morning titled in his presence and while you're turning i did want to make an announcement plan to have a youth meeting in iowa city next next saturday young people if you have any questions go ahead and write them down in advance and send them off via email to uh brother samuel email or brother isaac um and we can collect those questions and he can pray over those questions and review those and then before the youth meeting happens he can come in the presence of the lord and i believe that god will give an answer to every question why why do i say that because god has given brother isaiah as our pastor we have a question he has given that gift to the local body and we are to take advantage of that gift [Music] and we want to make sure we're taking advantage of those that's iowa city next saturday 11 a.m depression look forward now i got uh we're gonna read quite a bit here we're gonna read most of this parable so brother i don't know if you want me to read all the way through and then you can come by afterwards and read all the way through all right hey man so we'll start with 36th verse and it says and the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down at me and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at me in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and she kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment now when the pharisee which had been him saw it spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who in what manner of woman this was this is that touches him for she is a sinner and jesus answering saying to him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master sayon and there was a certain jesus gives out the parable he says there was a certain creditor which had two debtors and one owed 500 pets and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him the most simon the pharisee answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and jesus and he said unto them thou hast rightly judged i want to skip down to the 47th verse he says wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little amen [Music] [Music] we approach unto you this morning we don't ask you to come into this place because you said that you would be here so we know that you are here for you have met every appointment lord wherever two or three are gathered in your name you said i will be right there thank you for coming into this place this morning our hearts are open to you and right now lord we just lay our lives down upon the make sure that our hearts door is open lord that we have uh lay down all of our sins we have cried out unto you as moses or as abraham says i have lifted my hand and i have laid aside all the things of this world and i am putting my eyes and my faith on the o lord see my wife and lord that right now this morning we just give you permission father [Music] lord speak to us lord in the way that only you know lord lord do unto you us the only those things that only you can do open your eyes lord into your presence lord for the we might be the one that said i saw the lord not as those that that that just come and go and never actually see you father lord let us be those in this generation that we have seen the lord jesus christ on his throne in glory and we know that his coming and we have rejected the things of the world my word living in the in the presence of the lord jesus in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you you can be seated this parable uh brother brandon preached on it multiple times a few different ways he approached a different person i know i remember one time he preached on uh the messenger that went from this pharisee the pharisee's name was simon and simon had decided that he wanted jesus to come to his feet as he was putting on a feast and he was going to invite a lot of the celebrity from around the city and he made the decision that he uh maybe he could have a little bit more fame if he invited jesus to to his feast and so he sent this messenger to go find jesus and as this messenger left the pharisees presence he went looking throughout the land to find jesus it is brother branham gave out the story let this messenger search for two or three days working for jesus as jesus was giving out the message and as soon as the message was over there was a time of healing and the power of god was present as all those that had a desire upon their heart that they would come forward and and not one thing would be with hell from anybody that come in faith and if anybody had a sickness and they would come in faith to jesus christ and he would discern the very problems of their hearts they had a need that he would just reach out his hand and touch them or whatever their problem was that they would be healed in the name of the lord jesus christ and this messenger saw this it's a message but for all that his heart was not even touched and he just sat there and waited for the meeting to be over is it he because he had this message that he had to get to jesus and as soon as the meeting was over jesus left the crowd a protective circle around him and as they would guard him and protect him to get him to a place where he could rest before is that nobody knew about where the crowds could not find him sit there and he just sit there and rest devastated this messenger followed at a distance as soon as jesus got to arrest him and as the messenger finally got to sit at jesus's feet at this point in his sermon i would not take that moment lightly if i would have had a chance i would have thrown myself down at the feet of jesus i don't care how many guards were around about it nobody could have held me [Music] cleans me from all my habits and let me serve you for the rest of my days i give my life to you if i could just bend that messenger but this messenger did none of those things is coming and the messenger was satisfied if i could have been that messed up i would not have given up that moment for anything you didn't realize whose presence he was in the message he didn't realize who that man let jesus christ was the very throne of jehovah jesus remember jesus christ jehovah was back upon the earth again for some reason this messenger was blind to them and furthermore jesus knew all of the uh knew what was behind the request to be revealed hey man it's just for another religious task just for uh another uh a a a a feather in his hat just another little uh medal he could have that we had jesus at our meeting and that's just about as far as the mind of simon went that's just about as far as as much revelation as simon could get about the matter of the problem but when the day came for simon's feast on the scheduled day that jesus is very faithful to keep all of his appointments if jesus ever makes an appointment [Music] all the pharisees were invited and jesus shows up when he comes to the door there is no one to welcome him and he he goes in there is no one to kiss him you know there was other men that were welcomed greater than he was jealous there are other men that were shown more favor at that feast and as many people as had received that invitation it just seemed like jesus christ was given the least amount of welcome of anybody it's always jesus christ sitting you know and and and as and she had this this reputation where she wasn't allowed to come to meetings like this and as she as she went by she saw that jesus was in attendance and you remember how the story goes that she went and sold all that she had and purchased this alabaster box full of ointments looked through the window and she saw his feet were awfully dusty all the traveling maybe he has not been welcomed i can welcome him where his feet have not been washed i can wash his feet where he has not been anointed maybe i can anoint his head where he has been unloved maybe i can love him where he has been unwelcomed maybe i can give him some welcome and so as she brought the alabaster box she stuck around and came into the service door and she found herself in the presence of the lord jesus christ and that's why we're going to entitle this message this morning i don't think there is anybody japan's pacquiao that has a right mind about him that could have the eyes of the lord jesus christ focused upon once it is she saw the eyes of jesus that were affixed upon her she began to see the love that was behind those eyes see the compassion that was behind his eyes she began to think about how unworthy she was we had to think about the greatness of her own sins yeah she began to think about all that she had done upon her life she wasn't even worthy to be there come on caused her to begin to cry she began to weep and she began to wash his feet and her tears began to drip upon his feet she took up her hair one of the greatest events in all human history what's happening right there in his presence in his house one of the greatest events in all the history of humanity was taking place in his house a sinner was repenting before christ i remember [Music] and i went to church almost every sunday of my life as a teenager when i would read the book of revelations i would pray and i placed one of these sermons living in a little house in paris and i took and i typed into the search engine i heard a lot of bad things about brother and so i hit play on the computer and when that voice began to come out of the glitter the bafta for 10 years i've been praying i knew i was lukewarm i didn't know what to do about it for 10 years i've been crying out for the lord how can i be an on-fire christian in the united states the same yesterday today [Music] but the lord i didn't need to be born in china jesus christ was the same yesterday today within 20 minutes i was laying face down on the floor don't i found that which i was looking for we get tired of sitting in his presence [Music] [Music] is we get to that place where he realizes undone that's the only way we can ever find him amen amen and so jesus asked simon there's two men simon [Music] [Music] and forgives them both [Music] oh he had gone to church day in and day out he had been heard many fine sermons he had gone to church probably every sunday of his life and as he he is meeting in the presence of jehovah are the the very pinnacle the apex the the the peak the pyramid the capstone the the very capstone of his church the author and the founder of the foundation of his fate amen here is not only the foundation [Music] amen because the reality of it was is that both the woman with the alabaster box they were both in the exact same condition it wasn't about the other learned one might be able to say simon might be able to say well i haven't sinned as much as she has amen and so the problem was it's not that it's not that he didn't realize it's not that he didn't have the presence of jesus in his house constantly god has not left himself without a witness from the very foundations of the earth when the spirit of god was brooding over the dark waters because life just sprang upon the one time moses he uh god called moses he says i want you to bring you up and the elders of the house of israel the as they sit there that they feasted at the base of the mountain and their eyes were open and it says they saw the god of heaven while they ate and they feasted on [Music] up in the heavenly places of the presence of the lord jesus christ the great infinite god the grandeur infinity being housed in a finite house hey man and he saw this this uh holy place he called it a little tent he said with the ark of the covenant on the inside and badger skins died red on the outside and he began to see a courtyard and he began to see the the the all of israel guarding around the uh uh the courtyard all of them had their they had their banner the four banners on the four sides and he says i saw the banners that one had the likeness of a ox and one of the banners had the likeness of a of a man and one of the flags one of the banners had the likeness of a flying eagle he says what put these four banners around the holy place and the children of israel followed that pattern on down throughout their history wherever the presence of god was it was always protected throughout history ezekiel saw something similar let's start ezekiel chapter one ezekiel chapter one is it first one it says now it came to pass in the 30th year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month i was among the captives by the river shabbat and that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god now come [Music] i just want you to know if you can put yourself in ezekiel's shoes that you are standing there where ezekiel stands you're living in captivity in captivity all of the the church is laying in ruins you're been in chains 500 miles away from jerusalem and the tribes have been put into off into captivity in captivity your children don't even speak your language anymore your children are growing up and they don't even hardly know who jehovah is grandison pacquiao they know more about the gods of babylon than they do of the gods of jerusalem and your heart is burdened [Music] how can the people of israel survive how can the children of jehoshapha survive upon the earth when all of our national life has been ruined everything that we know about jehovah has been destroyed all the natural functions of our religion are ruined to the functions what is going to be the what is going to be the future of the children of israel [Music] [Music] and as the cloud gets closer and closer he begins to see a fire in the midst of the he said clouds see the fires folding inside of itself and folding and whirling in a whirlwind and this whirlwind comes closer it's spinning and rocking and jumping and it's just like a fire unfolding about itself came in the uh closer and closer he begins to see four living creatures come out of the midst of the clouds [Music] in the past right now prophet is having his own vision the things are leaping out of history into the modern day some people he'd heard that were around the tent in the wilderness of the man of the lion and of the eagle that these same living creatures are now flying in the midst carrying those banners he begins to realize that the things upon the earth of his natural religion far beyond the heavens for let me tell you if our eyes could just be opened that we could see that these symbols of our religion symbol the pillar of fire of of the worship the presence of the lord jesus christ that these things would not just to be trinkets laying in our church jesus the son or not just be uh little things that are good to have not just something that you put on the front of your pulpit or that you have on the wall hanging in your church lord and savior died for ourselves hey man by all of us he was a man that was like simon simon and he had uh the revelation that simon had studied under again he was to know or so he thought he knew all there was to know about the religion of the jews but when he came upon this journey to preach the gospel of the lord jesus christ [Music] greater our sins get it how i've now lived with jesus christ long enough i began to realize i can't even walk and i wouldn't preach a message until i had seven pages of notes written out but the longer i preached the more i realized speaking i don't have to get onto youtube and learn all the ways to uh the fine art of public speaking but what i need to do is terrorize my senses myself [Music] i know that you have something that you want to say to your people what is your message because i can't even walk the longer i go in my christian life i began to realize that i am the chief of sinners i need him more than anyone who started out and simon have now become the woman with the alabaster box my sister forever before amen as the presence of the lord has been traveling through this earth he's always had a guard around about him those same four living creatures i don't see ezekiel saw them traveling we saw them flying in the heavens have you bullied only you saw the fire and folding around about itself the food you know was the voice of the almighty god amen in the presence of the lord jesus christ the book of revelations revelations chapter four verse one you don't see oh saint john is speaking he's just caught the revelation of the seven church ages and he is faithfully written everything the lord jesus christ has told him the audience of the lord jesus christ and jesus christ has been speaking to him the angels of the church telling him everything exclusively he's been writing it down write down the message to the church messages to the angels of the church and all of a sudden in revelations chapter four after this i looked up and behold a in the heavens it was he even thrown on the scene there was one that was sitting upon the throne oh the prophet john here you see the prophet john he is now uh he is john the evangelist serious now he is riding down he is he is in the very position [Music] hey man he's he's sitting there in the isle of patmos oh you know he knows that jerusalem has been destroyed amen he knows that the the children of the jews are in the natural or being persecuted and now he's in prison on isle of patmos for preaching the word of god he's gone through a lot of a lot of troubles he's gone through a lot of the same things ezekiel is gone but all of a sudden the door is open in the heavens and he sees the throne sitting up in the heavens and there's one sitting upon the throne and it begins to talk to him just like executive experience he saw the lightnings and the thunderings and the voices he saw seven lamps of fire burning before the thrones amen he saw the the various lights the amber light he saw all those things and then he saw the four living creatures there around about the throne and he saw that they were this just like the uh the flags that were surrounding the holy place creatures just like ezekiel he said and the fourth beast i saw was like a flying eagle and as these uh uh in revelations chapter five verse one you don't have no apocalypse [Music] you know ezekiel didn't describe this easy kill now let's tell you the time has come for a book to be revealed once john is seeing it he comes in slain it is worthy today to take the book and let me tell you that same lamb is in the building this morning amen he is here to unseal the book to you he talked about how back in the old days god was veiled behind a thick and heavy veil behind that veil he says that veil was ripped [Music] i don't have to look at the whale's belly like jonah looked at it be looking beyond the natural atmosphere the door has been opened up into the heavens he's sitting upon the throne that has been unsealed might be doing a result with the video yeah i will give you rest you will be my bride of my friends i heard all these things if you could just get yourself out of your seats all at this little church in hickman i don't know but we are standing in heaven when we sing those songs jesus christ jesus is my plea if you would look down and see you're not standing on this carpeted floor where you are standing we're not standing where we think we are [Music] amen and let me tell you when you begin to worship him like that that's good beyond these naturals where you think you're standing in glory you've entered into it's like it's like if the the future home is like if it went down from florida placed yourself in the midst of the city all the way from hickman avenue all the way over to colorado all the way over to ohio all the way down why because it's a city send out from god out but tears brooded over the waters you don't know this day the plan of god remains unchanged how much our eyes are becoming open or in amen those four living creatures are still guarding the throne of god god is now inside your hearts waiting there to remodel to transform you into a temple of the most high transformation where although the world has been constructed of the lord jesus christ supernatural you don't have to wonder who you are amen but then you begin to realize that all power in heaven and earth is given unto you heavenly father brother branham at the end of his ministry talked about a sermon that he wanted to preach called the trail of the serpent and i i and i can almost maybe see what that sermon would have had inside of it just as much as you could preach a sermon on that subject for you what spirit they will received whether it be the spirit or the attitude of simon the pharisee or the spirit and the attitude of the woman with the alabaster box as soon as she cracked open and unsealed that box [Music] of that ointment began to catch the attention of the people in that room as we worship the lord jesus christ we break out where the albastar box is broken open for the lord jesus christ begins to fill the room the pillars of the church begin to move and flex at the presence of the lord on the outside of the worship service because they don't have a revelation of their sins amen will they sit on the judgment seat there is nothing good with him the only thing i have lord is this little tug upon my heart that you've given me this tug you've given me this knock on my heart's door is the only possession i have lord [Music] oh don't you realize saints has begun to fill the room [Music] as jesus says who's
